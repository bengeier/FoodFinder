{"text":"This place is amazing, the food was the best quick serve Mediterranean I have had. Cant wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Parsley's.  I had a Groupon worth  $16 to spend.  I ordered the chicken plate, an appetizer of tabouli, and parsley fries.  When I got home I was very disappointed.  They gave me steak instead of chicken, and the appetizer of tabouli was about a 1/4 cup worth with no pita (which they told me would be included).  Definately not worth the price of $3.99.  Everything was just ok tasting, except I really liked the rice.  Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally Vegas have a good Mediterranean restaurant that serves an excellent shawarma  The staff are friendly and the place is clean an modern."}
{"text":"place is good for a quick lunch. meat is very tender, they are cutting it right in front of u fresh of the grill.  It is a healthy version of a fast greek food :-) 3 starts because the place could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Visiting the area, and decided to check out this place for a quick easy evening meal. The food was great, the workers were friendly and helpful, and a customer also gave me some pointers on what to order. I recommend this place to anybody in the area, and I would go back."}
{"text":"Really good $5 yellow curry lunch special!  Very busy at lunchtime, but staff is friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Staff was great and food was excellent. Chicken nachos with French fries is bomb. Fed 3 ppl and we were full with some left over. The kabobs were nice and juicy too. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"My office is a mile away and this is by far my favorite spot to eat. There are probably a hundred restaurants within 3 miles but I always end up at Parsleys. Jo and Lizeth are always amazingly helpful and the portions are huge. If anyone is looking for the most delicious steak, chicken, or veggie wrap for $10 this is definitely the place to go. Definitely 5 star food and service"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple months ago and wasn't very impressed, but I was blown away upon my second visit last week. It must be under new management or something. Employees were very helpful and even let me sample the shawarma. Ended up going with the chicken kabob bowl, which takes a few extra minutes to prepare, but was worth the wait. The meat was so juicy and flavorful. I also love those little picked carrots they serve. So tasty! I would love to have one of these closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that other diners enjoyed their shwarma as mine wasn't worth eating.  Chicken shwarma is a favorite of mine.  This was the first  time I've had it as dried out crumbs with very little flavor.  The salad on the plate lunch looked nice but tasting revealed that the dressing was very bland. Not the kind of meal I'd expect for $9.99. Baba Ganouj as a side cost an extra 50 cents and was well worth it....the best thing I tasted."}
{"text":"Recently found this place and I'm so happy I did. I ordered the falafel wrap and watched him make the falafel balls right there. Fresh and crispy on the outside and moist and full of flavor on the inside. The wrap was also huge! I would suggest splitting or getting the salad, but for $5.95 you can make two meals out of it! Everything is simple, fresh, and made in-house. I will definitely be back time and time again. Can't wait to try the chicken shwarma next time."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's basically like Chipotle but Mediterranean . I've always said the next big chain/franchise is going to be a Mediterranean and this place has the potential of being that restaurant! Everything just makes sense."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food. I go twice a week for lunch. Great lunch specials and extremely healthy food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The falafel from here is amazing and still steaming hot when served. It's definitely the best falafel I've had outside of Israel.  And the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is FIRE. They slice the meat off a freaking rotating spit! Customizable ordering so you can make it your own. Gluten free options. Vegetarian options. Healthy. Super fresh. Get the parsley fries and ask them to add tzatziki to em. You'll die then thank me."}
{"text":"Been here many times and this place always satisfies! 1st introduction to Mediterranean food and now I'm hooked! Love the falafels and shwarmas plus service and price is on point with the portions. Nothing bad to say, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean-Mideast.   Without a doubt, Best falafel sandwich in the city.  HUGE size, AWESOME taste, at great  price. Also had the stuffed grapeleaves and the accompanying sauce  and it was as good as my mother's.  Food is fresh, everything prepared in front of you and EXTREMELY clean."}
{"text":"Food was better than expected, workers were very helpful since this was my first time going. I had the Chicken shwarma plate, I got extra hummus on the side which was a dollar and change more, no big deal.  Will definitely go back time and time again."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in town! The kabob is my favorite and is always cooked perfectly. The service is excellent and they actually get to know you and prepare your plate exactly the way you like it. Lunch hour is really busy as the locals have all figured out this is the best quality food in the area. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place said they have the best wraps in town so I had to try it. They use tortillas from a bag, the ingredients weren't too bad but weren't great, but the worst part is the smell of this place! It's awful! I don't know what died but get rid of it. I can't tell if it smells like a dirty kitty litter box, horse stables, or some hippy's armpit. Sorry to say, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients and generous portions! The beef kabob bowl and homemade cucumber water were delicious."}
{"text":"So we found this place in Yelp with a decent review and planned to give it a try.. one of the best place for falafel. The parsley fries were yummy too.. The best of all is their unique sauces.. loved everything we tried. Shawarma is good as well. Only thing we didn't like too much was the baklava.. definitely it wasn't the best I ever had. All in all definitely this place will be in our list of to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great people great food and fast! We've been here a few times before very good food. Try the pineapple frappe!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and entire experience was 5 stars! I had a small chicken wrap and my husband had the regular steak wrap; both of us saved the other half as the portions were very generous & everything tasted amazing! Parsley fries and falafel appetizer were delicious too! Service was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. My food has been fresh and consistent the last 5 times here. The carrot salad is addicting (and the won't share their recipe) the cucumber chiller is perfect when it's hot out.  And I swear I've lost about 5 pounds since eating here... Everything is made in house and they just care about what they serve and it shows...."}
{"text":"You need a fast Mediterranean bite; this is the place. Bright clean decor, Fast service with a smiling eager staff. the chicken kabob was moist and well spiced; all the items I tried were well done and flavorful; one odd thing no lamb but I will be back."}
{"text":"GR8 GR8 GR8.....Healthy, Tastey food,  Large Portions, Priced Well.  what more can you ask for?   I had a Chicken Shwarma wrap. They used 1 whole cup of shredded chicken.   I was given a choice of white or whole wheat, HOME+MADE  pita bread that was rolled out like a giant tortilla.  They have a to go menu printed on glossy paper that features photos of their food.  As do many other establishments, the difference being at PMG the pictures actually look like their food. That's as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and I was very impressed! The food was very fresh and full of flavor! This place is very clean and the employees are very nice. I was also impressed with the price. I'll be returning often!"}
{"text":"Ok so if you have never had schwarma, don't ask what it is, just go and order a chicken shwarma wrap with everything on it, add feta. I absolutely crave this place. Their pita chips are made fresh and are crispy salty crunchy seasoned goodness. Try it once. You are addicted. Its all over. Go there. You need this."}
{"text":"This is a well run quick spot with healthy food. Both times I visited the owner was ensuring everything was to the satisfaction of the customers. The food is fresh and the setting is fantastic. I have tried both the beef and the chicken. I would highly recommend this place for lunch or an inexpensive dinner."}
{"text":"Really disappointing 12$ greek chicken salad sorry guys. Worst I've ever had actually. Like the other review said the chicken tasted really old, overdone, and maybe even rotten :/  The tahini dressing was also really gross which is weird because tahini is delicious!?  Also feta cheese was not included and was an additional $1 -_- which is pretty sheisty in my opinion. I think a $10 salad should include cheese. So they taxed extra for cheese and veggies that are normally included and gave me old ass chicken. Merp. For these reasons they get a bad review and hopefully they see this and stop serving people old crusty chicken. Someone could get sick  Positives* Friendly customer service Unlike the chicken the veggies and salad seemed pretty fresh"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few weeks ago because I bought the Groupon and have been here 3 times since. Excellent food. Large portions. Pretty good value. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for vegan food so we hit up this spot the food was good and it accommodated all of my vegan needs as well as the service was amazing. Ivonne was our cashier and she was really patient and helpful. Cute joint."}
{"text":"Joe's crew serves up generous portions of healthy food and hospitality.  Check out their offerings on Groupon!"}
{"text":"Best hummus EVER!  I have eaten many kinds of hummus, but nothing comes close enough to even compare to the hummus I had in Israel... till now!!! I will never buy hummus anywhere else again. We also purchased the Wrap and couldn't be happier. So delicious. I will order from here again, and probably in the near future."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, most stuff made in house and healthy. Good portion as well. Service is quick and friendly"}
{"text":"Bomb red quinoa salad with your choice of sauce drizzle and cucumber drink!  A healthy alternative to the pizza cheese burger american diet. Add Hummus n' chips and side of pita bread yum!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  I am from Michigan, where the middle eastern food is plentiful, great, and cheap.  It is nearly impossible to find such value here in Nevada.  Finally, Parsley provides this.  Some of the greatest falafel and chicken shawarma that I've had, and all for great prices.  The hummus was silky, which is the texture I prefer.  Go here if you want tasty, healthy food that is also affordable."}
{"text":"I used to order there a lot. It`s been about 2 Yrs. Today I ordered(to go) for 2 people , the chicken kabob, salad, & hummus with a side of fries., paid almost $28.00 for crappy food. the fries were mush, there were 5 pieces of chicken ( each order was for 2 skewers) means I got 2 pieces on 1 skewer and 3 on the other ;( Had some nasty sauce poured over it which I didn't ask for. And way to much oil in the salad plus more nasty sauce. Then to top it off ZERO pita bread. Called them and they offer me $1.08 off my bill. A place I will NEVER return to & not recommend. The only reason I put 1 Star is because Yelp makes you !!!"}
{"text":"OMG!! I have to drive all the way across town for this and I would do it every freakin' day if I could.  I am torn on reviewing them, because i really don't want the line to get any longer, but perhaps if they become filthy rich they will open one closer to me.  Order anything.  You will be very, very happy (although be warned, you will not be able to stop eating it)."}
{"text":"Just visited here for the first time today with three friends and we were all blown away by how delicious everything was. The service was great. The food was unbelievable. The portions were huge. I had the chicken kebab platter and you get a delicious huge portion of chicken with rice and salad for less than 10 bucks. The wraps and falafel were really great too. Unexpected gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Eating healthy no carb lunch while truly enjoying it is rare and truly a challenge!! Parsley allows me to enjoy a chicken salad.  I strongly recommend the place! I love to order a chicken salad with an addition of one spoon of humus and one spoon of egg plant salad.  Their wraps and falafel is also great.  A good restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!! I get the bowl, half chicken half steak, and they give you really great portions. It's a little pricey I would say but you will definitely have leftovers so it's worth it. Friendly people working as well."}
{"text":"The best Chicken and Steak bowl i have ever tried. Cucumber juice!!!!!! Loved the store and employees. Will come back more times. 10 stars"}
{"text":"Love their flaffel bowl here! Joe is so friendly and staff is nice here. Good portion and good prices! Definitely a nice healthy option too!"}
{"text":"Regular customer. Fresh ingredients. The chicken shish kabob and baba ganoush is outstanding."}
{"text":"The chicken could use more seasoning, but the portions are generous and if you can get a Groupon, then its all good!"}
{"text":"Our meats on the platters we ordered (one chicken, the other steak) was a little on the dry side, but it still had good flavor"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean restaurant I have been to in Vegas.  Not only is everything incredibly fresh, but the people are super kind and helpful, and the fact you can get your meal to go in a chipotle style system makes Parsley a great choice for any occasion.    I come for lunch and there is always a great deal that I try to take advantage of, but can never stray away from the parsley fries... if you come you have to check them out.  The meals are priced great (usually under $10) and they have huge portions, so I am able to fill myself at lunch then have a snack for later.  Overall, I try to stick to the mediterranean diet (healthiest diet there is) so having Parsley around makes that goal so much more obtainable.  Whether its a salad, or kabob wrap, everything is so dang good you'll have to come back to try them all.  Check out Parsley and you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I was in the area yesterday so I saw this place and popped in for lunch.  Ordered the Chicken Shishkabob plate to go and ate it when I got home.  It came with some yellow rice, an Israeli salad, and spicy carrots.  The whole plate was delicious and filling.  I'll definitely stop by again when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good food.  Prices are OK.  Seamed like there can be a lot of upcharges.  $0.50 here, $0.50 there.  Not a huge deal.    My wife and I did not really care for the spices on the Chicken.  The Beef was good.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery  Pita was hard as a rock the chicken was overdone, chewy & tasted rotten so we could not eat it  the falafel was underseasoned  the salad was soggy and the lettuce was black  This had good reviews we were excited to try it but ended up regretting it."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, pretty healthy.  The wraps are where it's at, along with the house made pita chips and hummus.  Do it."}
{"text":"Vegetarian falafel wraps are perfectly spicy, delicious and wallet-friendly. They take a while to make but it's well worth the wait. Tip: one falafel wrap is enough to feed two people."}
{"text":"They have some good food but expect a long wait especially if you want the kabob waited almost 30 min for the food they also charge extra for a little hummus. The shwarma isn't bad and if there's no line you can get out probably in 15 min."}
{"text":"I can't believe the good reviews this place got!  Are you people serious?  First off, the place is very dirty!  I saw a huge group of bugs/ants in the back corner by the soda machine where i was sitting.  I should have just left at that point.  Then, I saw them drop a piece of raw chicken in the salad and then take it out, and then continue to serve the salad!  That is a MAJOR HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!  I could not believe it.   The food was mediocre at best - too many sauces and very soggy.  When I brought it up to the owner, I think his name is Effie, he said it was fine and everything was \"fresh\" - i told him that wasn't the point, but his macho-self didn't want to hear it.  This place should be shut down by the health department - and their customer service sucks.    Oh, and 50 cents for extra olives????  REALLY???? It is a Mediterranean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went there today because I wanted to use my groupon, which was a deal where you pay $12 for $20 value of food. I ordered 2 small steak wraps, with 2 combos of fries and a drink.When I went to pay, the cashier looked confused, which I didn't understand because I had used groupon before with no issues. She then called over another lady (who had a rude attitude) that told me I couldn't use the groupon with a combo (fries and a drink). I was confused because it doesn't even say that on the groupon. However, I didn't want to cause any issues so I just let them charge me for the wraps, fries and one drink at their regular price. They overcharged me because the total for my food was $24.68, which means I only needed to pay them $4.68 since my groupon value was good for $20. I ended up paying $9.46 instead. I really think the cashier had no idea what she was doing. Also, it was difficult to communicate with the staff because it seemed like they didn't understand English so well.  They also had problems adding my purchases onto the Perka app that they advertise to use. Overall, I felt cheated and I will not be returning to this place anytime soon. Beware if you are using groupon!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food choices! Had the falafel salad and a free baklava with the Yelp check-in deal. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. My new favorite Mediterranean joint for lunch.  They let you do 50/50 chicken and steak shawarma for a single plate.  Both are delicious. Chicken is leg/thigh meat, not the dry breast meat.  Still love Shawarma Vegas, but Parsley has much better atmosphere and lower prices."}
{"text":"I would like to put five stars however as much as I want I wouldn't it's clean the price is good but the meat very salty I tried also the chicken shawarma in each time it's different sometimes it's good and sometimes it's dry.  Its one of the best Mediterranean restaurant that there is here in Las Vegas without overcharging you"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I order for a group of 20 people on a regular basis. The food is consistently delicious and the customer service is also wonderful. I highly recommend Parsley Mediterranean"}
{"text":"As someone who loves mediterranean food, I found the food at Parsley to be great and satisfying. The falafel is my personal favorite. It is a great place for a quick lunch. Love it. Love it. Love it."}
{"text":"A nice lunch place. If you want something healthy with some flavor and won't break the bank this place is A-1. The staff was nice so I'm not sure where those comments of unfriendly staff came from. The chicken was very well cooked & didn't feel weighed down after eating it. Will go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! It's like Chipotle, but better because it's Greek!!!! They are ALWAYS consistent in their servings too, unlike \"other\" places. The steak bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have eaten a few times for lunch at Parsley and have never been disappointed.  The shwarma chicken wraps are delicious as well as all their salads.  Very fresh.  I also decided to have them cater my daughters graduation and all my guests raved about the food."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I went to parsley for work today. We could not have been more satisfied with quick service, and the food was great! Love the chicken kabob salad it was very fresh and juicy!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma and schnitzel. Generous dish size, even kids menu is like an adult dish. Delicious! The owner and employees were very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Worth the chaos of noon rush.  Delishous schwarma and falafel with fresh salad and rice.  Tender Pita and flavorful hummas.  Definitely get the spicy carrot pickles."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I wanted to try a new place for lunch and we decided upon Parsley after doing some yelping. It definitely exceeded our expectations. Some of the best hummus we have all ever tried and the chicken was so flavorful and not dry at all. We ordered this on Wednesday and have been talking about what day we want to do our next \"take out\" so we can order Parsley. This will absolutely be one of our new favorite go to places. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Such great food and wonderful staff. First time here and the man helping us out was so kind, really appreciated is patience and hospitality!"}
{"text":"An excellent choice west of the Strip. The housemade tzatziki is bright and fresh and delightful. The BBQ Baguette - Steak is big and delicious: good grilled meat without unnecessary, excessive flavorings; quality bread and healthy accompaniments. Replacing the BBQ sauce with tzatziki made it even better. Courteous and civilized service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I'm not sure why the reviews for this restaurant are so high. I found the food to be basically inedible.   We ordered the chicken shwarma plates($9.49) after tasting a sample of both the chicken and the beef. The beef was most definitely dry dry dry. The chicken was only slightly better so my husband and I both ordered the chicken. It came with rice which was neither fluffy nor flavorful. The largest portion on the plate was the salad which was okay. I found it to be the most edible thing on the plate. The pita bread was your basic packaged pita.   The chicken and the rice were so dry and bland that my husband and I left all but a couple of forkfuls and gave the rest to our dogs who were also indifferent. They ate it anyway but not with the same enthusiasm as for other leftovers.   My son had the BBQ Beef Sandwich combo ($10) - the beef was flavorless but was \"saved by the BBQ sauce\" according to my son. And the bread was soggy. The fries were kind of mushy.  He said he wished we would have went to McDonald's. Me too I guess. It's cheaper anyway.   I say skip this place and save your money."}
{"text":"Absolutely delucious food! Good quality and very reasonably priced. This place is definely a good call."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant, everytime we come here we leave very satisfy, but today 10/17/17 I came here to buy some food to go for.my husband and at 9 30 and the lady in charge wanted to charged me $1.00 for every sauce that supposed to be included on the food (the times that we went there in the afternoon nobody charged us extra)and I order chicken shnitzel bowl which wasn't fully cooked it was very unpleasant to find out that. I will never go at night ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service is exceptional! I am a newbie to Mediterranean food, but they were happy to let me the Schwarma before I made my wrap, and helped me decide what to add in! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Service was friendly and engaged, and the food was amazing. Absolutely coming back for a pint of that hummus. The cucumber melon drink was addicting."}
{"text":"Great food. Exultant service friendly owner and the most important they use only organic veggies and stuff. Everything is fresh you cannot stop eating even when you are not hungry"}
{"text":"All four of us not only had a delicious lunch here but also had a great time.   The bowls were full and everything was very flavorful.  We'll look forward to stopping by again."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken curry and Mediterranean food in general! Will return again, and again, and again..."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I go here at least once a week. Love there steak bowl and baklava. Very professional and great customer service. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went there twice during our stay at vegas. Had chicken and beef shwarma. They both tasted fantastic. I took rice and salad with it. Quite a good combination. To top it off I took eggplant curry which was also good. The curry tasted a bit sour that blended perfectly with the meat and rice. Would definitely revisit if I get a chance."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because i was in the area and it had a 4 star rating. Food here deserves about 3 stars, but it is really salty. The steak was dry and tough.  2 steak bowls came to $24.83. They nickel and dime you for toppings. Cheese, olives and other toppings do not come with the meal, they are considered extra items. All items that would typically part of the course at other establishments. This place has potential, however, this visit was disappointing. Price does not match what they have to offer. Plenty of Mediterranean places in town that have similar offerings, but do it much better."}
{"text":"Good, fresh ingredients. Awesome employees and quick service. We were greeted just as we walked in. When asked if it was our first visit (which it was) we were given samples of the steak and chicken. I had the Chicken Shwarma Salad and it was really good.   I have had better Mediterranean food, but this place is fast, which is great if you don't have a lot of time to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with you people who like this place???!!! I got a chicken wrap....to go....got back to the office....took a bite.....chicken bones!!!!! Bad enough that I'm having lunch at three....but now...no lunch!!!! This place sucks!!! Next time I want something healthy but tasty, I will go ANYWHERE BUT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give it a shot. I thought it was going to be expensive, but I just got a Flat Bread Steak thing and it was delicious. It was only $5.99 with a drink. I decided to add chips and hummus as well (extra price).   Good taste great and the meat is amazing. The staff is really nice and the venue is cute. I will definitely be back. I highly suggest if you want a healthy, affordable and delicious place."}
{"text":"Just awesome food simple as that !! Try the chicken and beef curry to die for!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"One of the few places in Las Vegas that I trust for good steak schwarma, served up quickly and by super friendly employees. They even have a frequent diner punch card to thank loyal repeat diners. Prices are reasonable, and portions are generous.   Their schwarma, chicken schnitzel, hummus, and spicy carrots are all quite tasty.  I hope their coming West - side location is as good as the location on Sunset."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at Parcleys a few times.  I notice that the food during lunch time tastes more fresh than in the evening.  Like the beef kabobs I had with mom last might were on the dry side.  I told the manager and he offered a replacement today and they amazing.  I will most likely revise my review after a few more visits.  They are very close to where I live so I am here atleast twice a week."}
{"text":"Yum! One of my favorites! My friend got me hooked on this place. I love that it's always so fresh and flavorful.  I recently visited this location for the first time and I was impressed. I don't know what to compare it to as far as authenticity goest, but it's delicious and that's all that counts.  The service was friendly and the place is clean. I love the falafel, the chicken curry and their hummus is delicious as well! The prices are great and the portions are generous.   I will visit again and do recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day and the place was crazy busy with nearby residents looking for an afternoon bite. As busy as Parsleys' was, the employees were happy and doing all they could to fill those orders.  I had the chicken schwarma on pita and it was absolutely delicious. The meat was succulent and the vegetables were fresh as fresh could get.  All in all, I'd go back again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We were in the area, Parsley caught our interest so we stopped in. They kindly gave us samples when they heard it was our first time. We each ordered a wrap, I had the regular with steak and my husband chose the chicken on wheat. with tasty fries. We also got an order of falafel.  Both varieties of shwarma are good, the wheat wrap is way too dry, I don't recommend it. Get the regular. Other fillings are fresh and tasty. The falafel tasted way overcooked; based on my experience I can't recommend that either.  I'd like to try the salad on a return visit."}
{"text":"This place offers authentic Mediterranean cuisine in a somewhat chipotle like style. I did enjoy the meal, although I found ordering process a bit confusing. Meals are  listed on the hang up menu but lacks description of what comes with it. I ended it up getting a 8.99 bowl but my bill came to $15 because I didn't know everything is extra charge. Gotta say food is absolutely delicious, but lack of descriptions what goes with the meal you choose can quickly add up to your bill. For that reason I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Costumer service is great, even though their English isn't so great they are very pleasant and fast services . Order the chicken wrap is to die for !!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped into this place out of pure convenience yesterday.  I happened to be sitting right in front of it when I did a search for vegan food in Vegas.  So I asked myself, \"Why not?\".    I was greeted by a friendly, smiling man; the one in the video.  It's a small, casual place but seemed very clean.   It's set up sort of like a Subway.  I wasn't familiar with some of the choices so they gave me a taste of a few different options and reassured me several times that what they served me had no animal products in it.  (I did notice that there were meat options available) I opted for a Falafel bowl, which was 6 falafel patties on a bed of rice over fresh greens.  I chose sides of babaganoush, cucumber, tomato and a small bit of tabouli, all topped with a creamy tahini dressing.  It was a huge lunch, but it was a wonderful blend of fresh flavors.   I can't wait to go back again!   If you haven't been here, you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Food was great and potion size was more then enough. Service and helpfulness was as well a pulse from Jo. Great place will defiantly will be going back! Did I mention inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"The schwarma is outstanding. Spicy goodness. The family was apprehensive going in, but the service was great, and the food better."}
{"text":"The perfect choice for a family with various dietary needs.  We were able to feed one vegan, two paleo and one standard eater well.  The food is authentic and delicious.  For vegans the falafel is awesome.  The steak bowl was also tasty.  Portions are big."}
{"text":"I tried to order steak kebob but they made beef kebob. I asked for tzaziki on the side but they covered all the meat with tzaziki. Taste is more like middle eastern. Not Mediterranean. Price is good. Taste is okay."}
{"text":"This place is good. I eat lunch here often and it doesnt give you the food knockout after. The wraps are good and the salads are great. Service is excellent they just open a second location on tropicana near decatur next to starbucks. That location is just as nice as the 1st one. No disapointments."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. The guys behind the counter are great at helping you navigate their choices and have great suggestions.  We had chicken baguette sandwiches. The chicken was freshly cut from a spit, and the sandwich was absolutely delicious. Well run and well maintained. A small sidenote, the area is a little questionable. There were times when we didn't feel really safe while we were eating because of shifty looking patrons.  Keep your wits about you if you go. You'll get great food."}
{"text":"This is an amazing new Mediterranean fast food restaurant - Chipotle/Subway style of ordering.   The place is well decorated, clean, modern and there's good radio (hits) music playing (not the greek or arabic music you hear at other places).  The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is self service. The prices are super low. A small chicken wrap is $6.49 and the regular (their large) is $7.99. And the small one is not small at all.  And you get to choose your meat and veggies and sauces like you do at Subway. Unlike most other places who only offer tge thicker pita bread, here they have the thinner one, which I like better. You can also choose white or wheat bread.  I got a regular white chicken shawarma wrap with  ther vegy salad which is amazing and added parsley (hey, it's their name), garlic spread and tzatziki sauce. They'll ask you if you want hummus, but I told them no, and got the tzatziki instead of the hummus - so it's your choice, and I recommend you donthe same. Tzatziki sause is basically a dill yoghurt sauce used for wraps and pita breads, and in my opinion goes better with the chicken shawarma. Chicken shawarma is rotisserie grilled chicken on a typical Mediterranean rotating grill and is cut in small pieces. The wrap was amazing. The chicken is fresh and tasty. They do season it slightly and it tastes amazing.   I also tried their home made \"special recepie\" cucumber chiller drink  ($1.99). It's very refreshing, try it!  This is probably my favorite Mediterranean food place in town now. For the price and quality it is simply amazing! Try it!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Reasonable prices , I love their chicken shawarma and all the salads. It's really a great place to eat lunch or dinner ... Go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"They have great food and I go there all the time and think u should to excellent suevice. Good and beautiful food"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Healthy, fresh, organic, delicious food and fast friendly service!!Love it!! Quinoia salad is amazing! Even my usually picky toddler loved it! Thank you! We'll be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"So after watching The Avengers I was a bit curious as to what Shawarma was, I did not understand Iron Man's craving for this magical \"Shawarma\" but I was intrigued and determined to find out.   On a day out with my mom we could not decide what we wanted to eat, but I was starving for something different. She said we could eat Greek, something something chicken, at first I was hesitant, \"chicken\", it's not my favorite meat, but I was up for the challenge. As soon as we got to Parsley during this monsoon-like Las Vegas weather a huge raindrop landed in my eye, I guess it must have been good luck that I was visually impaired, it was indeed a sign from Zeus himself saying \"Feast on the nectar of the Gods my dear child.\".  Luckily this place not only has Chicken Shawarma but also Beef Shawarma so I opted for the latter in wrap form with all the works and an added treat of those beautiful olives. The serving size was more than enough for me, I could only eat half my wrap, and beware these wraps can get messy.  This place is on an popping on those rainy days I might add with all sorts of people, it's kinda cool. The customer service is really great! Lots of friendly people.   The layout if this place is pretty small. I'd say 30 people max? There is outdoor seating though.  For those who say \"Ehh, it's not the best Shawarma.\" I wonder what really good quality Shawarma taste like because this is just fabulous.   Sorry for this mini epic, but now I know what Iron Man was on about, we should listen more often ;)"}
{"text":"Great food here.  I always get the Chicken plate and add hummus.  It's delicious and fresh.  I need to try more items on the menu but it's good so I get the same thing each time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The Parsley Nachos are to die for. I'm here about once a week and have all my contacts workers hooked on it!"}
{"text":"Their beef and chicken on the rotisserie was old and hard.  I almost cracked a molar on their crappy meat.  I wil lnever go back there again and I had a Shwerma salad.   Stay Away.  Go to Olive or some other place for middle east food, these guys sell you old food."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars because the people working there were very nice and understood customer service, that being said, I don't agree with the place being a \"Mediterranean\"  place and I have my reasons as well.   First thing, as many might know, a Mediterranean place will 99% of the time serve Basmati Rice to go with the food. This place, no where close. Second, too much salad... Infact a lot of salad. Don't get me wrong, I love salad but if I am getting a shwarma plate, I want more of rice and chicken. This, the Mediterranean chicken is supposed to be marinated overnight in spices and the chicken I had here, well it was really blend.   Some people might like the way they make their food but I have eaten authentic Mediterranean food many many times and I don't like this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every thing I've ordered has been delicious and they really pack their sandwiches. Had some lady night and I'm already craving some more."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to the Halal guys that I can find, even though it is actually VERY different. I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time but for some reason never bothered to try it.. but once I did, I was hooked!.. I've been back several (understatement) times.   My all time favorite selection here is the steak shwarma bowl (which they also offer in wrap form or plate) with extra parsley and their green hot sauce: its basically a circular tin plate they fill with rice over a salad, and beef on top... and your choice of tzatziki or tahini (mmm tahini...). They cut the beef fresh in front of you & give you a decent amount of it. Normally, I'm not a fan of salads or rice, but the steak shwarma bowl is packed with flavor and far from bland. The portion size is also very decent considering the price.. it can be split between two people, but since I have two stomachs I tend to eat the entire thing myself :)   I've also tried the curry chicken special they had. It came out piping hot and was also fullllll of flavor. Like the steak shwarma, it was delicious, but I didn't like that the rice was at the bottom of the bowl which was filled to the top with curry. I eat my curry with rice like most people, but I like eating the two together with mixing at my own discretion! I might try this again in the future if I happen to be craving it, but I think anyone one that comes to Parsley should try the steak or chicken shwarma before anything else!  The seasoned fries: they're really crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you like fries, you'll like these. I wouldn't order them again though, because I didn't think they were anything tooooo special. Nothing too different compared to normal fries.  One downside about this place is they charge you fifty cents for extremely small portions of \"sides\" .. sometimes I get the eggplant, but the little cup they give you is ridiculously tiny. . .   Also: they are extremely busy during lunch time! This place is tiny so there isn't too much seating. It's very convenient though, if you're just ordering to go."}
{"text":"Delivered on time. My ONLY reason for giving them 4 stars is because they didn't include the sauce I requested. Instead of me having to request some extra sauce it could be included to add to the flavor of the shawarma wrap!"}
{"text":"Steak bowl, hummus, plus free baklava from Yelp check in. Coming straight from the airport and feeling dead from lack of sleep, this meal has been my saving light. I haven't had a more satisfying meal like this for a long time. From the hummus appetizer, extra large steak bowl (you can share) and yummy baklava, you can't beat it. It just makes me sad that there's none of these in Florida."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken curry is wonderful. I love the fresh vegetables. I get the salad every time. My only suggestion is that they expand the restaurant into the vacant space next door. People are always encroaching on your space while you eat. And turn the music down it's impossible to hear the workers when you order."}
{"text":"This is a sitting down restaurant but you do get in line to order your food first. Get what you want in a bowl,plate or bread everything was deliciously fresh and tasty I had the chicken with rice and salad; the cucumber water was ok just  a bit to sweet for my taste. Service is good but they do get busy at lunch and it's hard to find a place where to sit."}
{"text":"The food was great and the services was friendly.  One thing I would suggest a minor change is the menu.  For the first timer, it's kind of overwhelming and confusing.  However, my overall experience was great, food was delicious and healthy.  It was little difficult to find seating inside the restaurant, single person was taking up a table for four.  The counter had four seats but two were taken by employees who were eating.  The other two spaces were unavailable due to the countertop were used for their dessert.  Overall, I will say you should go try it out."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is awesome. Try the hummus shawarma with rice, it's amazing. Portions are huge and I usually save half for dinner. The steak is a little more expensive than chicken but just get it, you won't regret it. Parsley is also on Ubereats, but you won't be able to do all the cool topping options on that app. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Food looked really good. I got the steak salad with falafel on the side. Everything was some what bland but overall tasted okay. I don't think I will be returning here because there really wasn't anything that would bring me back.  Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. I eat here regularly and the food is always great. Hummus is the best in town."}
{"text":"Its an awkward concept that doesn't make itself clear. Anyplace that you have to be \"in the know\" on how to order or what you're getting can kind of be more hassle than its worth. For example, here's how one part of the menu reads: Chicken Bowl Chicken Plate Chicken Salad Chicken Kabob Bowl Chicken Kabob Plate Chicken Kabob Salad  No explanations below any of those. They only seem to have a grill. So what's the difference between \"Chicken\" and \"chicken kabobs?\" You'll have to ask. And they didn't seem to have much of an answer other than when i asked it to say, \"oh, ok. chicken kabob.\" and put it on the grill. So I still have no idea how the \"chicken\" is different. I asked about the bowl or plate. Or on a napkin? I ordered the chicken salad. My friend ordered the bowl. The only difference was the addition of rice to the exact same dish. Assembled exactly the same way. When I'm tired and hungry, I don't have a lot of excess patience to try to figure out what you are trying to sell me. As for the chicken itself, they put it on the grill for a LONG time. I expected it to be way overcooked and dry. But it wasn't. It was perfectly cooked. The beef didn't come out as well. Overall, the food wasn't bad. They just need a better explanation of what they are selling and how to order  your food."}
{"text":"It's hard to find healthy food on The Strip that doesn't break the bank. We found this gem when we were craving something filling and fresh. You get a lot of food for the $. I had the falafel bowl and was very impressed with the flavor and quality of the food! Would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Good food value.. fast!  Subway style order setup with flavorful, generous add-ons.  We had one large steak and large chicken wrap $8.99 each, one combo (drink + appetizer) and 1 extra drink.  Only ate half our sandwiches.  Best deal - share a large sandwich or get a regular plus order a combo. They gave us a 1/2 pint of bana ganoush.  It was Excellent with perfect subtle traditional smoky flavor.  Take your time ordering if you haven't been there.  They expect you know what you want if they are busy.  PS they gave us a free baklava for checking in... it was VERY good.  Crisp philo and not drenched in syrup."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here, I wish I would've taken a picture of the veggie sampler platter the host put together for me but the first bite made me forget about any other action but to continue to the next bite...highly recommended for the Mediterranean lovers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this restaurant. The quality is excellent and the portions are a huge value for the price. However, I have to take off a star because I dislike the fact that there are so many toppings that cost extra and they're not cheap. You could add $10 in toppings alone! I can understand a few premium toppings at an extra cost but 1/2 of the options are an up sell. It's a fantastic restaurant, but I hate to feel like I'm walking through land mines when I'm trying to make my bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent service with a smile. Food quality very good also. Tasty and presented beautifully. For a \"fast food\" eatery its above expectations. The staff was so busy during lunch hour but they never forgot to smile."}
{"text":"Great place with very attractive prices! We had chicken plates and a falafel salad. The portions are generous. The chicken plate comes with salad, rice, and warm pita bread. I dropped 1 star because the first shaving of shawarma chicken was dry. Other than that, very good food and service."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food. Reasonable price!! Food tastes delicious, good quantity. I went there with my wife. We ordered falafel plate and chicken shawarma plate.. we really enjoyed the food. Staff was friendly. They offered me to try some of there food.  Free deserts for being a yelper. Win-win:)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Not like ur typical Greek restaurant. Everything is good from appetizers to wraps and salads. Don't forget the spicy sauce. It's a MUST!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food. The wraps are **HUGE** - easily two meals. I enjoyed the chicken curry over rice, and loved the fresh-from-the-fryer falafel. Nothing in the ambiance department. (Unless you feel that Subway and Starbucks are the height of class) - but quick and tasty. Limited seating."}
{"text":"So yummy!   I don't know how I stumbled across this place - just craving Mediterranean one day I think. I took my sister and she LOVED it too.   I'm not the kind of \"regular\" where the employees should know my name and I theirs, but every time I go in during the weekday and during my lunch break (somewhere between 12-2 P.M.) the employees who greet and serve me are so friendly and patient (which is helpful because I don't always know what I want right away - too many yummy options!).  Also, my first time there I really wanted to try the Hummus, but the guy at the counter stopped me and warned me that Hummus is (generously) put on their shawarma before the rest of the ingredients- not many places will do that and try to trick you into buying the extras so I appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Great food. Generous (maybe too generous) portions. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great healthy food....tastes great.   I would recommend for lunch. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}
{"text":"REALLY, deserves 5 stars!!!!!! The 2 guys that worked behind the counter were very helpful.  I would say: \"What is that?\" They would say: \"here try it!\" The food is really good and the place is clean.. I used a Groupon, I was happy to see it was good for everything in the place...(It seems like now every time I use a Groupon they have all these specials that you cant have with the Groupon!!) I HATE THAT!!!!!!!  This Place is not fancy at all, nothing special to look at...So shut your eyes and enjoy, because whats important is the FOOD!!!!! My wife is a Vegan and they had food for her to eat also....When I took her there she mentioned she drove by the place before because it didn't look like they had anything for her....she really liked her food a LOT also... Ill repeat the 2 guys that worked there were pretty cool and kinda funny. Its nice to know that you feel wanted and not a burden at a business.. GO THERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best veggie falafel wrap! Great place to hit up if your looking for healthy/yummy food"}
{"text":"I was another who purchased on Groupon.  The photos made it look like a restaurant.  It is a strip mall fast food type place.  So I started out disappointed.  The food was not really my taste... but it was OK.  My vegan friend was beside herself loving it....so if you are a veggie type you will probably love it."}
{"text":"I like how this restaurant is easy to find, it's on the corner of E Pecos Rd and E Sunset Rd and it's a short walk to Starbucks. It is a small place with reasonable seating but the food taste amazing. You have a choice to make your meal as a bowl, plate, a wrap, or sandwich.   I chose Chicken Shawarma Plate ($9.49) with Yellow Rice and Fresh Crisp Salad. The carved chicken has a slight hint of crispiness which taste yummy when you eat it with tzatziki. The yellow rice is fluffy and good. I selected every topping for the fresh crisp salad, it has romaine lettuce, dice cucumber, dice tomato, red onion, chickpeas, red cabbage slaw, parsley, crunchy slice carrots, and a mild green spicy sauce. Also I ordered the Chicken Curry ($3.99) which comes with soft tender chicken, green bell pepper, tomato, and the gravy taste creamy and flavorful. The eggplant ($1.00) is serve as a cold savory side and it has red bell pepper. I wish I had more of the delicious eggplant. And they offer Baklava ($1.99) for dessert. I had two different kind of Baklava: one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle, and one with almond filling topped with almond slice. Both baklava have honey but the one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle is a better choice, I like that it has a nice sweet and tasty crunch.  On the wall they have a canvas of rich, vivid imagery of spices and herbs. There are at least 5 to 6 tables and a side window seating. And when the weather is nice and sunny, you can enjoy your meal outdoor dining on one of their colorful rustic metal table. While dining in, they were playing upbeat music like Janet Jackson \"Escapade\" and it brings back fond memories of the 90's. The service is nice and the people are friendly. For a plate they give you a generous portion at a good price. It does get super busy around lunch hour but the food here is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I wish there is more than 5 stats to give you. I really liked the food , bread ,fresh made from scratch hummus and bread .  Since I moved over here in the state I was locking for authentic food like that.  I am from Middle East and I can recommend that with close eyes . They gave a small tiny modern. Kick to the traditional food without any compromise In taste  Consider it as  chipotle for middle eastern food but very  authentic    I do recommend humus sharwerma bowl with some fried eggplant . I tried it wit tahini , I would say try it better with Greek zasiki.   My wife had chicken shawarma and was great also    I will write this review in different languages since I love both food and languages ;) lol  Para empezar soy Árabe y me gusta comer todo. Este lugar fantástico y muy original . El pan es fresco hecho adentro y tiene blanco y integral. A mi me gusta el segundo mas. Es mi fijo parece hasta una tortilla mexicana grande. Pero sabe diferente .  El humus es fresco hecho en casa y también la shawarma    ( el pincho redondo de pollo y carne )  La gente son amable y muy servicial . Hasta John el americano blanco habla español ( mi respeto John ) ere súper amable .  Usted puede compartir tal vez el plato mezclado con su pareja porque son generosos y servían  bastante . Yo soy comilón.  Lo comí casi solo.

{"text":"Better late than never but this place is Mediterranean heaven!  Ordered the steak plate & loved the Mediterranean rice & salad. Definitely add tzatziki & definitely get the pita chips & hummus. The steak was so tender & seasoned well.   I also loved the customer service. Workers were very welcoming & explained how to order upon finding out it was our first time.   My only dislike would be the baklava (which you get for free with a Yelp checkin). I just didn't enjoy the texture & taste but besides that, dinner was awesome!   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I found this place few months ago. So far I've tried 4-5 different dishes and I love them all. The food is always fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"Love me some Mediterranean food! Very good place if you want something fresh to eat! Staff was very helpful and friendly. And you gotta check in to get that free baklava! One of my all time favorites!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I don't think I would ever come back. I felt so rushed, I told him it was my first time here and they would not explain the menu! When I get to the register I see the person in front of me have this extraordinary looking meal, and I get one little rap. And we pay the same price? How does that happen. Thanks, but no thanks. If you can't take two minutes explain to me your menu and make me feel welcomed, my money is not welcome here either."}
{"text":"Very nice Mediterranean place. A good, healthy and inexpensive option not too far from the Strip. We enjoyed the sampler plate and the red quinoa salad. The hummus and tzatziki were very good and the pita was fresh and hot. I wish we'd tried the eggplant salad."}
{"text":"Off The Strip, But \"On Target\"!  We had an unexpected, pleasant surprise when we stumbled onto Parsley's.  It was the yummiest, healthiest and best value meal we had on our 6 day trip in Vegas.  We are regular goers of Mediterranean food and feel this is up there with the best we have ever had.  I cannot over-emphasize how tasty the food is!  The staff is extremely kind and friendly.  The food is fresh, tasty and abundant (generous portions). The restaurant is very clean.  This location is easy access off of Tropicana."}
{"text":"Meat was practically beef jerky. In total honesty, this restaurant is not very authentic. They did handle the issue very well so all in all I might give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it is close to my office. I have been here three times already and the food is just not to my liking. I don't like the food, service or overall cleanliness.  I invited my coworkers and they did not care for the food either."}
{"text":"Can't have big groups but great for 6 the most and food is yummy and they're pretty quick there."}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing ! The food exquisite! Very satisfied with the veggie sampler!"}
{"text":"I've always gone to the one at Tropicana and Decatur but got to try this location today. It is just as amazing! The best shawarma wraps I. Vegas hands down. Service was great! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mediterranean food! The ordering style is like chipotle but with so many more options. The hummus is made to perfection and the kabobs perfectly cooked. I highly recommend and have become a regular customer!"}
{"text":"It was fresh! But I felt alittle odd until the owner came out then the atmosphere hanged for the better!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to come eat. They are so amazing they went out of their way to give   me an amazing special. The food is great, the employees are great and it is super hip and clean."}
{"text":"I was so exited to try this place. My mom and her coworkers go there for lunch and she recommend it to me. To bad I didn't get to order because while me and my boyfriend were looking a the menu one of the employees pushed through us like we weren't even there and didn't even stop to apologize.  We were so shocked that both our mouths were open. There was a older couple that were eating that was shocked as well. We just decided to go somewhere else where we might feel more welcomed."}
{"text":"Food was great and ready quicker than I thought! I would order from them again-budget friendly and good"}
{"text":"Just got a chicken kabob bowl to go for lunch. I have mixed feelings about my bowl. The flavor of the chicken kabobs is amazing and the bowl is light, fresh and healthy. My only problem with this is that my chicken was undercooked. When I got there and ordered the lady said I'd have to wait 10 to 15 minutes because the kabobs are made to order and I was find with that. I waited about that amount of time until she called me up to build my bowl. When I got home I took one bite and felt rubbery uncooked chicken in the center of one of the chicken cubes. I went through and shredded them all to see which ones were edible and ended up throwing away about half which was unfortunate because I was hungry. I'll probably go back because the flavor was great but just be aware that you have to make sure they're fully cooked. In the future I might ask them to cut them up when they take them off the kabob so they can see if the center of the chicken cubes are done."}
{"text":"Oh man! This place is awesome! A couple of my coworkers had been to a different location and were quite unimpressed, but this location exceeded all of our expectations. If you've heard bad things about the other location (which I can not corroborate) then it is still definitely worth your time to come to this location.  There were four of us, and we tried four different things. The beef and chicken curries is what I got, as well as pita chips and hummus. The curries are amazing, and the hummus is very good. It doesn't take top spot for best I've had, but it's definitely ranked very very highly. That was quite surprising for me, as this is basically Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I didn't expect hummus this well executed from a place like that.   I think that actually sums up anything else I could say: I had a certain level of expectation for this place and it blew that expectation out of the water. The food was great, worth well above what they're charging. This is restaurant-quality food at fast-food prices.   I will, without a doubt, be back here quite regularly. I can't think of a better endorsement than to become a regular."}
{"text":"One of my favs! Everyone is so nice and personable you go in only a few times and they know you. Food is delicious as well. Place is very cute and clean !"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The shawarma is SO delicious! The food is flavorful and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked."}
{"text":"What a great find! Clean delicious med. food. Great vegan and veggie options. The portions are generous. I've started going here once a week because I start to crave it.   I usually get the falafel salad with tahini. The sampler platter is great if you want to try other extras! You basically get to choose 6 different options. The grape leaves are delicious and a must have!"}
{"text":"Had chicken shishbabob and beef kabob. Chicken was good but beef was not juicy.  To be fair, it was a to-go and took some time before eating, and it was grilled to order - I felt like I missed the best moment.  I'll eat there while fresh next time."}
{"text":"Like chipotle, but Mediterranean style.  It was my first time there and didn't know what to order.  Place is down the street from the Orleans hotel.  Hummus plate: wayyyyy too much hummus.  The entire bottom was covered in hummus as if it were rice---could have lasted me 3-4 days.  Just meat on top with few toppings.  Half & half plate: salad, rice, beef, chicken, & toppings.  Much more than hummus plate and it tasted better.  Order this if it's your first time.  This was more flavorful.  You can probably share this plate with someone and both of you would be full.  Cucumber water was good.    Will definitely be back for half & half plate during my next Vegas trip.  Worth going here with Groupon or not!"}
{"text":"The worst customer appreciation place in Las Vegas. Won't miss the mediocre food from this place. Go next store to US fried chicken. Better food and way better service.  I've been coming to this place for a while and they had a program to give a free meal after 5 paid meals. The last two times I went they said next time they would honor the free meal the next time I came in. I even had a signed receipt stating they would honor the free meal. Of course when I came to get my free meal they didn't honor. They switched there program over to an app that doesn't work and never honored the free meal I earned. Guess they don't value repeat business."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place and finally had a chance to stop in while in the area. The service was excellent and friendly. The portions were large and flavorful. I ordered the beef wrap and the everything was wonderful except the meat. It was rock hard and the texture was tougher than beef jerky. I wish I had ordered the chicken or just vegie wrap. I would not go out of my way to come here but if I am in the area, I might try something else to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Went here when I was in Vegas a few trips ago, now I don't leave Vegas without stopping in for a bite.  Great food that I feel good about eating, finally!"}
{"text":"My husband has been raving about this place for the longest time. He finally took me there one weekend and we both got the chicken bowls. Oh my gawds they were amazing. The baklava is to die for as well. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"we went to this place recently because their menu is predominantly Shawarma. They have steak and chicken Shawarma. The problem is it isn't Shawarma. True Shawarma is meat whether it be chicken, Lamb or beef marinated with the appropriate spices for about 12+ hours. I ordered the steak Shawarma. It was not marinated and therfore was not Shawarma. My wife ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was not marinated but a very plainly cooked chicken. They didnt even use salt and pepper. My steak Shawarma was doused with Tzatziki. It tasted ok but we were really looking forward to some real authentix Shawarma. Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there."}
{"text":"Have probably been here now 7-8 times and the word to describe this place best is consistent!! It has always been good whether it's a chicken shawarma bowl, wrap or even The falafel!! Everything has been dynamite! We now get lunch there on average twice a week!! I have at least 4-5 coworkers that now go here too. Falafel where have you been all my life! Theirs is great! You need to give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricey.  Atmosphere was horrible, impossible to hear the employees over the radio and hard surfaces with no sound deadening amplified everything."}
{"text":"Great tasting food prepared right before your eyes. I always get the wrap with either the chicken or steak. Haven't tried the kabobs, but hear they're worth the wait. Downside is that the line situation is really tight. Best to go when it's not busy or order online."}
{"text":"Found this place through Groupon, stopped by to grab dinner. Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.  In any case, the food was fairly tasty. Beef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal. The chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.  I wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the place is great! Huge portions, reasonably priced and tastes very authentic! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very fresh, clean and quick. I recommend the medium sized wraps loaded with all the different salads and spicy carrots for a kick. Also their falafel is excellent for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"First of all I would like to commend Eduardo for amazing service and creating a bowl just for me! I had a view specifications, but he made it smooth and easy explaining all the options clear and concise. Great customer service plus quality food creates a enjoyable dining experience. I will see you soon Parsley! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick service spots in the area. I can stay relatively healthy and still have a satisfying meal here.   My usual order is: hummus with the green spicy sauce, chicken shawarma, tatziki sauce, spicy carrots, their salad blend, and diced red cabbage. Sometimes make it a combo with grape leaves and their bomb cucumber drink.   Also see on here it says they're open until 9pm, but they're actually open until 10pm!!"}
{"text":"I told the guy I am a first timer, he offers us a sample of the beef shawarma (he cut it from the top).  I want to try the chicken one but he said they were out (when he was taking the last piece left from the stand, not sure if he is going to throw it away), he said those are no good.  The piece we tried, they were good.  However, when he cut it for our plate, he cut from the bottom, which has a lot of fat, tough, and the chewy part in it.  Price wise, for a plate (come with a small scope of rice, meat, salad, sauce, spicy carrot and a pita bread is $9.49+ tax.  According to the menu, I ordered the beef shawarma bowl, it should be $8.xx, but he charges me the same price as the plate.  I didn't look at the receipt till I got back to the hotel, it's not worth my time to go back and argue for the $.  The prices listed on their web site are pretty outdated.  Plates are $10.25, bowls are more than $9 after tax.  The guy is cutting from his skin.  I like the falafel as they cook it when I ordered it.  The Babaganoush is not bad.  If I go again, I may just go early and get the chicken wrap instead."}
{"text":"Very, very Americanized.  In fact, it's hard to recognize a Mediterranean flavor at all.  It is basically a sandwich and wrap house on par with subway.  There was no sumac or oil olive in site..... And the most atrocious, my feta cheese was shredded!  If you like a green salad on a baguette, this is the place for you, if you are looking for Mediterranean fare, stay away.    The coup de grace for the low rating is, the big sign on the porch says no smoking, but they let people smoke and it seeps into the building"}
{"text":"Updated: the staff contacted me about the review and made things right. There are still staff members that don't know what a salad is, but that's okay. The good is great and I especially like the lentil soup.   Super disappointed! I am a regular here because the food is good. Today was the WORST experience I've ever had here and has made me look for a new place to grab a quick lunch.  The new employee made my side salad in the full sized container- no big deal, right? WRONG! The lady (I'm assuming manager on duty) didn't 3 minutes telling me I ordered a Greek salad because of the yogurt. Firstly, there was no yogurt, I had a small soup; secondly, I know what I ordered.  Rather than simply apologize for the employee error and send me on my way, she literally remade the whole salad in the smaller container wasting my previous lunch time, her staff's time, and a perfectly fine side salad.  If the manager I'm familiar with isn't there when I go back (I believe in second chances, then I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Down to three stars. The shawrma plate consistently lacks taste and their tzatziki sauce has zero taste.   How about you add a bit of garlic into it?"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was great, and the price was outstanding. The only thing keeping me from giving it 4 stars is the fact that the beef wasn't cuts of meat, it was also a bit too salty for my preference,  and they didn't offer any lamb choices."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean quick eat here in Vegas. I love their vegetarian options and I love the fact that they have bowls, wraps and baguette to choice from for when I want more carbs or not. Lol Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food . Semi-healthy and great choice for healthy going individual. I got this as post-workout meal and it is a great balance between protein, carb and fat"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite  Chicken shawarma bowl. Best that I had yet.....it comes with a side of pita bread and tzatziki sauce......DAMN!!!! It dont even taste this good overseas damn!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered on yelp......had it ready.....good service...fast nice people......good food......im always happy eating from either parsley place thank you for your great food and service"}
{"text":"One of those small businesses you really want to make it. Patient food servers, great flavors and quality. Fair prices and fresh ingredients. Doing everything right. Don't change except to improve. And try chocolate baklavah."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with people saying they are turning into a nickel and dime and inconsistent.   We ate here basically when they opened.  Good food and service.  I would meet my vegetarian friend for lunch here.  We used the Groupon over the years.  They consistently put it on there and obviously must need the advertisement and discount to get customers.  Then they started making up rules to use the Groupon and we stopped going after it always being a hassle and extra for this and that and couldn't order a combo with the Groupon.  The food also began to be bland and lackluster at times."}
{"text":"Food was ok! They did not give us the sauce which was listed in the order. Portion was huge but it was dry we ordered the chicken shawarma bowl."}
{"text":"A poor experience at the other location kept me from trying this one- luckily, the chain has either changed policies or this location is just more laid back. Either way, this one I come to regularly, kicking myself for waiting so long.  Menu can be confusing for first-timers: mostly a Chipotle-style setup, with some featured dishes and specials. Wish menu was more clear about what ingredients come in what dish by default, so you know what you're adding on or omitting, but staff are generally good about walking you through the steps.  The hummus bowl is a favorite, chicken preferred, especially if you want high-protein. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to keep well for takeout/reheating. The wraps are easily shareable, or enough for multiple meals- pack yours with everything you want, staff miraculously always manage to make it close! Don't forget the feta and tabouli. Salads are decent but not my favorite, falafel is inconsistent (at times dry inside and/or oily outside).  Staff I've encountered are typically polite, informative, and efficient. I like how serving spoons for feta, tabouli, etc are regular, full-size spoons rather than the stingy measuring spoons I encountered on my visit to the other location referenced above and you are only charged for additional toppings (ie more than one serving)... or at least, that's my experience. Mixed info in other reviews suggests this may not be consistent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I eat there once a week. Chicken curry is outstanding. Wash it down with freshly made cucumber juice."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Awesome fresh food and there's usually a 40% off groupon available. The wraps  and schwarma look good, but I always get a couple mixed plates to capture more variety. Cold salad with kalamatas, hummus, quinoa, then a hot dish. The falafel and curry chicken are my favs. The staff is very nice. If you don't know what something is, they'll give you a sample. New foods can be intimidating, but try something new. You'll love it."}
{"text":"You can tell upon initial arrival this place has great food by the aromas coming from the fresh kabobs being cooked it's going to be good. Would recommend the kabobs and curry. Can't wait to try more from this establishment. Happy I found this hidden gem and really appreciated the kind service and guidance about the menu. It's hard to find great Mediterranean food in Las Vegas and now I've found my spot. Cucumber water was truly unique and wouldn't mind the recipe! Take a moment and treat yourself. Skip the processed food and get something fresh and tasty. You won't feel so guilty after. Thanks again to all the staff and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place. Great prices, tasty plates. On the Vegas strip it's either you pay heftily for decent food or pay semi-heftily for some junk-type food. This place is a couple miles east of the strip and your answer for well priced good food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken shawarma wrap and it was excellent. All the ingredients were fresh and tasted amazing. Would never have checked this place out but it had good reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Amazing. Today was my first visit and I will definitely be back when I'm in town! Great service and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh falafel!! So good. Wraps. Bowls. Shwarma. Feta fries. Curry chicken. Baklava. Very fresh and flavorful. Very friendly staff even offered me a sample taste. Cute patio.  Dangerous that this is so close to my gym! Oh, and they don't use styrofoam...I thank you, the earth thanks you."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here at least once a week!  I would really like to give a shout put to Maryiam (I hope I spelled her name right)  .. Everything I come in she is here.  She is always working hard and keeping customers happy!!  Every time I come in I can see other workers relying on her..  I see see she has a strong personality and keeps the food line together!  Good job!  And thanks for the great service Maryiam!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Generous portions delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"A must go, flavorful wraps the steak is seasoned perfectly. My new favorite lunch stop in town by far."}
{"text":"My first visit to Parsely was nothing short of spectacular. Located right before the intersection of Decatur and Sahara, Parsley satisfies all Mediterranean food cravings.  Menu: Choose a bowl, salad, sandwich...with chipotle-style assembly process Portions: Pretty big (could be split up into two meals...but I usually just indulge and finish it while I'm there).  The green cucumber drink  is refreshing and pairs well with their food.  Near perfect rating due to my most recent visit...not sure if the employees were new but I had to ask them about missing parts to my order (pita, veggies, etc). If it were my first time at Parsley, I don't think I would've returned based on that experience (as I wouldn't have gotten what I paid for)."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick bit so I stopped by. They were very quick and the food was great! I'll definitely come again when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Looking for something new and good food , this is the place great friendly staff great food . They make it your way , come see Tammy and James !"}
{"text":"It's a very clean and nice place to go and eat. They're portion size is generous and pricing is accurate. They great you nicely when you walk in and are very helpful. They also offer you samples incase you don't know what to get. Even with the samples they're generous!   The owner is a very nice Israeli man~"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some healthy, fresh, good tasting Mediterranean food you found the spot!  Everything I've had so far has been good but if you like curry I recommend trying the curry chicken with rice.  Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place,very clean and delicious foo,.good for vegans and vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"Just ok food. You get a lot of Food for what you pay but I did not think the quality was the high as they claim. My beef curry soup came with all the fat parts of the meat and the eggplant salada was packed in salt. Servers don't  seem to understand much English so I didn't quite get my plate as I wish. Menu is little confused."}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes. Everything is a Yes! Food, customer service, price!!! I got the chicken kabob bowl. It's a build your own bowl or plate or wrap type of spot. Everything they had was fresh and delicious. If your in Vegas you must eat here. Now, one of my favorite places. Plus kinda hard to find good places to eat it seems like out here. Portion is huge. You can even share if your not to hungry. They have this green sauce towards the end they top it off with and it's yummy yum. Everything is really good!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place every chance I get. The food is delicious and kind of reminds me of the food I had when I went to Greece. The tzatziki sauce is amazing when added to your food at the end. I always get the same thing here and it never disappoints on how consistent they are every time. This place I would definitely recommend going here if you like Greek food or want to try something different then the usual cafe rio or chipotle."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Friendly staff and generous portions. The parsley fries were GREAT. We had the chicken shawarma plate and the steak shawarma bowl. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My girl and I hit up Parsley ' s about once a week and we love it.As we always get the same thing we just nod and they hook it up. The hummus is made in store so big ups to that.Chicken curry, nice big portion, is my mainstay and my girl gets a Greek salad add chicken. We have been doing this for quite some time,  complimentary water with cucumber,  nice."}
{"text":"Very decent Mediterranean joint located in a plaza right beside a fried chicken place (which is also pretty decent!)   It is a chipotle or subway style of restaurant where you tell them what you want on and in your food. Pretty small area but I usually take my orders to go.  Portions are very generous.. however, you need to pay a dollar for any additional toppings other than what your food includes.   Nice restaurant if you're looking for a healthier option!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible tonight, sucks that I left a 4 dollar tip along with 26 dollars in food to just throw it all away and leave. Never going here again."}
{"text":"Delicious, the beef and chicken plate has good flavor and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I recommend the combo with the parsley fries. Perfect post workout meal. The staff, my server was Fernando, was friendly and very helpful in guiding you through the many choices."}
{"text":"Falafel quite good. Music loud and obnoxious. I'll probably not come again. Prices seem to have gone up a bit , so that combined with loud obnoxious music makes me only get an appetizer and get out."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat!!!   Just think Chipotle but with Mediterranean food. Fast, affordable and uber delicious you can't go wrong everything you want in a fast food, quality joint and quit healthy too at that.   Everything here is so good but my favorite are the -Falafel Balls (app or meal) crispy tasty and not dried at all -Hummus creamy, smooth texture and has great flavor -The Parsley Nachos (so bomb) crispy, crunchy not greasy pita chips top with their yummy shawarma steak, feta cheese, onion, cucumber that adds a nice chill, other goodies and tzatziki sauce from the Gods! I highly recommend ordering this!  -Steak Shawarma wrap all their amazing tasty goodies all wrapped up in their huge flat bread (you must have it with their spicy carrots. This will be the best thing you'll eat!  -And then there is their Cucumber Chiller drink. The perfect amount of cucumber flavor and sweetness at the perfect chill ever!  All in all if you haven't been here you must come here. You will not disappointed in fact you might be addicted. There is also a location on Pecos or something but I'm not sure if that one is quite the same. All I know us I can't wait to go back and try their other menu item!"}
{"text":"Well I am an avid traveler and this is one of the top Mediterranean restaurant I have ever been to. I'm a connoisseur of falafels and Baba ghanoush and this place has some of the best that I have ever had. The owners are extremely nice and the portions are generous. Also the Groupon that we found help out greatly as well! Definitely will be my go-to spot whenever I come to Vegas. I love eating food that is fresh and healthy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the falafel here.  I used to get the falafel burrito, but it's a lot easier to enjoy as a falafel bowl (ask them to cut the falafel balls in quarters).  The bowl includes salad, rice (I asked for less), and your choice of toppings.  I recommend red cabbage, parsley, tomatoes, spicy pickles carrots, cucumbers, and tahini sauce.  He perfect vegan lunch or dinner anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had an expired groupon went in and the food was fantastic! I had a chicken wrap and it was HUGE! I also enjoy the made fresh falafel. I want my food to be tasty but I also want good quality people on staff and the staff at this location are top notch! I say give them a try I am sure you will love it"}
{"text":"I'm so torn! I came in looking for a doner kebab sandwich to the likes of Istanbuls in Bally's food court, but that was probably my mistake; my expectations were too high! I got the steak wrap and was actually pretty put off by the gristley nature of the steak. It was tough to in some places. I just couldn't eat it. This is where I'm torn, the older man (maybe manager, maybe owner) was so gracious about my complaint and returned my money immediately. Also my son's chicken (from the rotiserrie rack) and rice was good.  I would come back but would need to try other things."}
{"text":"Had the falafel salad with a side of hummus. Everything g was super fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly and accommodating. A place to recommend."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. A little pricey for the portion sizes and amount of actual meat you get. The bf and I got a wrap, plate, two sides and two drinks and it came out to $25. Thats not such a deal for me. The rice lacked flavor. The meats were delicious and melt in your mouth. Delicious tahini and amazingly fluffy pita bread. Hummus also lacked flavor."}
{"text":"This is a great option for cheap, fast Mediterranean food.  It's off the strip and convenient."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off night but I'd have to agree to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this place. I think people might be fans because of the HUGE wraps. I saw them making one and I was amazed at the portion size! But lots of food ain't my style... especially if it is lots of crappy food! Tasted both of the shawarmas and they were drier than the Sahara desert plus gristle. Adding tons of tzatziki couldn't even save my meal. Their food didn't seem fresh to me at all, which is one of their selling points on their website. Either things have gone downhill, or it just wasn't in the cards for me tonight. I was really disappointed with their food and what I ordered. I really wanted to like Parsley Mediterranean Grill since it's local and I heard good things but I probably won't be back. The extra star is for the service and the chocolate dessert as both of those were good."}
{"text":"5 for the food. 3 for the service.  Food is great. They upped the prices a while ago and with the price increase there was a food decrease.. so now you pay more, get less. That's a bit annoying but the food still tastes great.  The service is slightly below average. They are inconsistent and they seem to like to cut corners to save money (even though you are paying for the food). For example, the salad is supposed to come with pita bread, but you always have to ask because they always \"forget\" to give it to you.... or are they just trying to save money even though your meal is supposed to include the pita bread? Also, they aren't completely friendly or helpful if you have questions when ordering.   I have continued going back because I do like the food the service is something I just thought I'd mention."}
{"text":"Love it , I come here whenever I visit Vegas !very healthy food the quinoa is delicious you see the owner around to make sure everything is good"}
{"text":"The food here was really really good , I ordered the chicken salad and everything was delicious the chicken was soft and tasty . I will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"I was kind of hesitant coming here, as I like a more traditional sit down place.  I was really pleasantly surprised at the quality and freshness of the food.    I had a steak shawarma salad bowl and found it to be really really good!  My lunch buddies tried the beef kabob, hummus and chicken bowls.  The price point is just right, the portions are large and the service is cheerful.  I still prefer a sit down place where you can order from a server and take time,  counter ordering has never been one of my favorite things - but that's just me.  They have really fresh and tasty Mediterranean food. At the end of the day - how can I complain about the counter concept?  Good Eats!"}
{"text":"First time here, high expectations from previous reviews. This place is the best we've had since moving to  Vegas. Everything homemade, beyond delicious. Staff Terisita and Joe were very nice, personable and really helpful in deciding what we wanted. we sampled several items before ordering and will continue to come back here often.   Great food!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I went for a group lunch and had the bbq baguette. It was one of those times I ate something and couldn't believe how perfect the taste was. I just absolutely loved it.  Other than the food my favorite part was the owner Debbie. She was helping people take food out to their cars, refilling drinks, talking to patrons and even cleaning finished plates. You could tell this place was her baby and she was the den mother. Such a charming and beautiful woman.  Thanks for a great lunch Debbie and Parsley Modern Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fresh food, awesome flavors. We ordered falafel, chicken curry, and shish kabob chicken, and the parsley fries. Everything was delicious! The shish kabob is cooked right in front of you, and the spicy carrots are great!"}
{"text":"Adding a star because I had the steak bowl today and it was amazing. I also finally asked about the extra toppings and they are an additional $1 for olives, feta cheese and tabouli salad. I added feta and tabouli to my bowl and it was really delicious. I like how they give generous amounts of meat and toppings. My steak bowl was super flavorful and reasonably priced. And they added a few more tables outisde."}
{"text":"With Mediterranean food I'm usually dodging landmines of my least favorite foods hiding in my dish. This was the case with Parsley, but the food was so good I didn't let it bother me for once. I got the chicken shwarma sandwich. I let her add salad and afterward realized it was filled with cucumbers and onions which I hate. I picked them out and still had a fantasic lunch. I'll make sure to ask for them to leave the salad off next time. The hummus was really good and the chicken was moist and tasty. Great healthy food place."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Their steak lacks flavor, their fries were alright. They should train their employees not to be on their cellphones while there's a customer in front of them. Their employees also need more knowledge on the food, because I wasn't even recommended anything after telling them I was a first time customer."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not gonna lie I was very saddened when Quiznos went out of business, but after today Quiznos is just a mere figment of my imagination lol...   First impression- Inside of the restaurant was done greatly. The setup is familiar to something you would see at chipotle,the lines were clean and it was open & modern. Chipotle style menu, but Mediterranean and better .There's also additional seating outside, but that's if you can find a table, if it's not occupied by the overflow loiterers from Starbucks next door.   The taste - I ordered the Red Quinoa Salad with shawarma chicken, that also came with pita bread . Since this was my first visit, the lady behind the counter explained everything in full detail and recommended the salad that I chose... She said it was perfect for post gym training .   I also ordered the cucumber chiller, it reminded me of an aguas fresca. It was very tasty. The salad was plentiful it included the following: salad, chickpeas, quinoa, chicken, feta,  tzatziki and I added carrots.  The flavor profile was very good . Everything was fresh and filling . I had leftovers .    Overall - Service was friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and filling and not overly heavy. Establishment was clean inside and outside . I give it 5/5    I shall return :)"}
{"text":"CAUTION: This place is highly addictive! It's simple, cheap and delicious. The staff is nice and funny. Mediterranean food at its best for a quick lunch. My favorite is definitely the falafel wrap. But the eggplant salad, the vine leaves, the hummus... are also stunning. Plus they now have a stamp card (and the electronic version of it on Perka), which gives you a free wrap after you buy 10. Fresh ingredients, vegan options, gyros with chicken or beef, smiles... what would you expect more? Less than $10 for a very decent lunch (even their small size is already enough)! I already converted some of my colleagues and we're now a couple to go there at least on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Very good food for reasonable price. Variety of spices to select from. HOWEVER, the customer service was off. They could barely understand me when I looked at them. (Mind you I was squared up and clear in my selection); this is most likely because of the subtle language barrier that I noticed. They weren't really happy to be there either. Once again, possible cultural barrier. Either way, if you are hungry, this is a good place to get food."}
{"text":"I really like Mediterranean food but this place was a big disappointment - primarily becasue it did not offer things that I really look forward to like dolmas.  I came in with a Groupon - second time I have used a Groupon for a Mediterrean place in Vegas that does not click, will stop buying Groupons I guess. I ordered two schwarma plates. I usually like vegetarian sampler type of plates. The people behind the counter were not helpful at all. When I asked about the sampler, they kind of pointed around at some hummus etc,, could not tell what I would get.  Really did not care for the chicken schwarma (agree too dry), the tzakiki (sorry for the spelling)in the squeeze bottle really turned me off so I asked them to lay off that stuff (usually like tzatiki).  The rice smelled odd and was a disappointment - am used to a choice but was told fries would be extra ( really like Paymon's, Daphne's Greek Cafe style fries) if I wanted to subsitute.  We took our food to go, got home, ate and really did not feel like we had eaten anything.  The place looks ok if you like wraps but I was really looking forward to a plate.  Location is squishy - not comfortable to dine in had I wanted my food fresher (with all the empty retail in Vegas - something with a little casual  outside vibe would be preferable - there is a big empty Henderson Town Center down the street I would recommend- squished in by the Jack in the Box drive through does not quite cut it). Anyway, unlike \"Arnold\", I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm sad. I love Mediterranean food and was probably spoiled at the variety and quality of the ones find in the Washington D.C.  and northern Virginia area. However, now that Las Vegas is my home, I am constantly searching for more places to love. I've been to this restaurant about a year and a half ago, it seemed they had just opened and so I was willing to overlook the lack of customer service and mediocre food. This time I returned around mid day and once again stood around while the employees worked in front of me without helping. I mentioned that I wasn't familiar with the menu and still no assistance. Finally I decided on the pita nachos with meat. The meat looked like Gyro style. The plate itself looked good, with cucumbers, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce and meat. That was the biggest let down. Just like the first time, the meat was full of tendon, rubbery gristle. What's worse is it was barely like warm. Shocking that this place gets good reviews. Maybe it's the veggies, they look good. Sadly, I'm not about to return."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I honestly don't know where the hell I've been. Since finding out about this place I'm HOOKED! The food is deliciously favorable. They have Healthier options as well which is great! They also have homemade cucumber water and its delicious! This is one of my favorite spots now!"}
{"text":"This place was a real crowd pleaser. Chicken was so juicy. Yum yum yum. Curry was so curry. Mmmmmm. Bread was dope. Water tasted fresh. Service was full of smiles. #lehgo"}
{"text":"They greet me with warmth and with a smile.   It's sort of like a Mediterranean skin of Chipotle. But higher standards, loving and alive. You can choose between a wrap / salad / bowl, and tinker around with exactly which ingredients you'd like on it today. Various sides, etc. The falafel is fried to order and delicious. All of the food is beautifully fresh. I recommend adding spicy carrots to the falafel wrap.  Vegan and vegetarian options, they're happy to accommodate and let me know what's what. It's always nice when they treat your dietary needs with care. Some of my crew has obligations and commitments, and during my 3-week stretch living on West Tropicana, Parsley provided a uniquely good opportunity to meet for lunch, where a veg can be a veg (others can eat animals) and we all can quickly get back to our day's requirements.  Pretty good portions/value too. Five stars, easily."}
{"text":"There so many falafel plate places in this town, I decided to try this one since it has good reviews. I have no clue why. I am so unimpressed.  I ordered the falafel plate with taboulleh, baba ghanouj, and rice and salad. Nothing tasted authentic, the rice was a bit lumpy and not fresh tasting. The falafel's were probably the best thing in this combo, and they were mediocre at best. Taboulleh was a bit soggy and nowhere near lemony enough. Baba G was not smoky, just bland. I'm pretty disappointed, although I do think for something so simple... I have eaten at so many places that screw this meal up. Add this to that list. The prices are reasonable,and the service is decent. But the food certainly doesn't warrant any reason to return.  Cest la vie, Parsley..."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! They knew the order of the customer behind before they even got to the counter!  I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super good food and great service. I had the chicken salad and wow was it great. No shortage of chicken and made exactly how I wanted it.   The owner was greeting people and asked if I wanted to sample anything. Of course I had to sample the curry. It was fantastic as well.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love how this place is right next to 24 hour fitness!   I ordered the chicken shawarma and falafel. The chicken shawarma was okay and the chicken was a little dry and not my favorite. I feel like the chicken shawarma was missing flavor in something. The guy also didn't give enough tahini sauce so my salad felt bland and dry. I definitely should order the steak next time. I love how can you customize your bowl but be aware that it's extra for certain things to add into your bowl/gyro/salad.   My favorite was their falafel! It was so delicious. The falafel was crispy on the outside and perfectly grainy on the inside.   Service was nice though! The guy was nice enough to put a little rice into my salad."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Been a few times. Offering samples is so nice! Food is fresh and tasty! Love the chicken curry, bit spicy but creamy and delicious. And the grape leaves is good. The eggplant is Heavy tasting but good. I thought the falafels were pretty good, they are deep fried. Baklava is good too! Nice inside and pleasant service. Quick place to eat with good specials."}
{"text":"The place has great food. Highly recommend if your in the neighborhood. I have been here like 5 times. And I always leave happy."}
{"text":"Love this place for a good meal. Always consistent and big portions. Healthy options with great taste. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"I abhor Las Vegas, but when I travel food is the only thing to make up for a subpar place. I wanted something away from the strip bc there's nothing worse than paying for overpriced bland food and since it was my Mommy's bday I wanted to take her somewhere that was nice enough to have lunch before going all out for dinner.  I ordered the special fries they serve and the Chicken plate. The food was amazing, on the healthier side, and fresh. By the time I was done eating half I was already full."}
{"text":"I love this place. I hate the prices. One dollar for basic sides like hummus and tabouli? Not for me. Great food though. Can't deny that."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing. We were new to this establishment and the staff treated my wife and I so nice. They also made suggestions that were very helpful for new comers that really helped us to choose a great dish. I would recommend getting the cucumber lemon water with whatever you order which was incredibly delicious and very refreshing. We are definitely going to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! The Staff here knows Great Service! Especially the guy Fernando he had really good knowledge with the menu, its a must try!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, always delicious! I ALWAYS get falafels but their steak and chicken shawarmas are some of the best.  Hands down the BEST babaganoosh I have came across in my food adventure so far!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good considering the price.  It's a great value.  What needs work is the customer service.  I went in on 3/26/2018 at abt 6:30pm and ordered two beef kabob bowls.  A shorter young brown hair girl prepared the bowls for me.  As I was choosing my toppings I could see she was getting frustrated with me.  Like I was inconveniencing her.  She started having this terrible attitude as to tell me hurry the _ _ck up.    When she was done making my bowls I asked for the extra chili sauce on the side.  This is a sauce that comes on the bowl.  And it's a sauce I've asked for extra on the side many times.  It's a sauce that people come up to the counter and just ask for when they want more of.    So she looks at me and with a rude tone says, \"ya but I'm gonna charge u for it!\"  I was so shocked by how she said it, I just nodded.  She ended up charging me a dollar for a miniature plastic cup of sauce.  Crazy!  Update:  The owner replied to my post right away and offered to make it right.  He said he would deal with the customer service issue and make it up to me.  This is very cool because I really like eating here and now I know the owners really care about their customers."}
{"text":"We found a pretty good deal on Groupon so went out there to try them out. First off, the portion amount is pretty insane. Not so much that you want to kill yourself afterwards, but bf and I were struggling to finish our bowl and wrap. After trying out Halal Guys a few weeks ago with an underwhelming outcome, we were glad we came here. I don't even really like chicken, but the chicken here is very tender and moist, not dry at all. And compared with Halal Guys, you get a real salad that's already dressed, and many other free toppings such as red cabbage, onions, parsley, tomatoes, tzatziki or tahini, spicy sauces, etc, and some extra charge toppings. For the most part, the extra charge toppings are on the left side, free toppings on the right.  We also got a beef wrap and the lavash bread is so good! They make it a point to tell you it's not a tortilla, and I think I remember the owner saying they make it thenselves, though not sure if that's true. Anyway it was good.  They have two hot sauces here. Not as hot as the red sauce at Halal Guys (thank god!) but even their green mild sauce has a nice kick to it. But honestly, unless you are one of those people that have to have hot on everything, the food here doesn't really need anything more.  If you're unsure of what to order, ask for a sample. They will most likely try to give you a sample of something anyway.  Without the Groupon, most entrees are about $9-10, but it will be a very filling meal. No need to add on a side unless you are sharing an entree. Usually we try to not overeat, but we can put away quite a bit when we want to. We ate until the point of fullness, but then there wasn't enough leftover for it to make sense to take home, so we ended up powering through and finished it all. So worth it!"}
{"text":"According to my classmates, this place is operated by Israelis.  I don't know what that means.  haha...but it might be helpful to some of you.  I liked Parsley a lot.  As soon as we walked through the door, the employees greeted us and asked if it was our first time.  They offered samples of their steak, chicken and falafel.  FYI: their beef and chicken is not halal but their falafel is a great option if you have diet restrictions.  It felt like we were at Chipotle but mediteranean style.  You get in line....you can choose from a wrap (white or wheat), bowl or sandwich.  Option of mild, medium or hot sauce.  I chose all. LOL.  then the vegetables, etc....  I ordered the steak wrap.  It was a generous portion of food for $7 including tax."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was great! A little pricey but worth it! The second time I came instead of getting a full appetizer portion of hummus I got a side, it's just me so a smaller portion is makes more sense for me. Well on the side hummus I was told they will not put olive oil or paprika on it.... Weird! Then my pita was super rubbery, when I asked for a replacement the lady was really rude and acted like all pita bread was rubbery! It's not! The gentleman working behind the grill gave me another, as he did the lady tried to stop him to again tell me that's how pita bread is. The second was just fine not rubbery! I love the food here but the service needs help!!!!"}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until got advertisement in the mail. Grateful that they did because overall solid mediterranean food. The best part is Parsley is located not only in the same shopping mall as my gym (24hr fitness) but close to the house. I use to frequent the Starbucks next door just thought of that space as loan business. Talk about turning lemon into superstar. The whole interior is brand new built everything up that I can tell from my last memories. It pleasant atmosphere to chill over lunch or dinner. I stopped by for late recovery lunch after long bike ride. First impression truthfully this was loan office with desks now more upscale look, open kitchen, the book shelves hanging on the wall for decor on one side, and any business with yelp logo hand painted that worth star by itself. They have couple long community tables with bar stools, couple seats at one end of the open kitchen can see magic goes on in the kitchen, and regular tables plus few table outside can chill enjoy your meal. Each table the basic condiments real nice set up. I love the vibe of the restaurant.   I ordered the Chicken Shish Kabob Plate. Talk about loaded plate of goodies. The chicken skewers they cook fresh to order. They do tell you in advance that going take few minutes. It came with rice and mediterranean salad. The marinated carrots (sure they name but forgot) that was star that never expected. The carrots had amazing depth of flavor with the seasoning on it and just refreshing carrots stick could munch on all day. The chicken once cooked was tasty. It was cooked perfection nice and moist/hot on the inside. The sauce on top perfect compliment round out the flavor of the chicken. The plate also comes with warm pita bread. I also ordered side of hummus. Mediterranean got have me some Hummus. Talk about tasty Hummus. Hummus and Pita bread. Devine. The Hummus spot on best had in Vegas.  They even server cucumber chiller or basically cucumber water. I am not fan of but nice option to have instead of soda. I really like the set up for it.   The staff is super friendly, helpful, and made the first experience great one. They have lot of healthy options also! They have on board on the menu that all vegan. Parsley is place that plan on coming back and if anyone looking for bite to eat once done working out at 24hr Parsley solid choice..."}
{"text":"I have been twice now, the fast food version of Mediterranean cuisine. great value, I recommend the wrap ,it's enough for 2. Only thing lacking is an experience staff. Both times visiting my order was charged incorrectly and the staff needed a lot of coaching to prepare the food, unfortunately I was doing the coaching. Come on now, all I did was look at the pictures in the wall."}
{"text":"Beef kabob meal is what I get every time at this point. It's a solid meal and good taste / quality for the money. Everything else I had there has been ok, but tend to order that one item. More fast food like than something like market grille or even chickpeas... but a solid option for quick value."}
{"text":"Woww!   My order:  Chicken Schwarma with a side of hummus and pita.   Order of falafel. Cucumber drink.  Side of garlic sauce.  Side of cucumber sauce.    Absolutely clean filling.  Taste delicious!   Will have you craving for more. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this restaurant sooner.  After the fact I realize this place is all the rave!"}
{"text":"If you're using Groupon, beware of GROUPON TAX which is not in the fine print! Charged me $1.22 Groupon Tax on a $15.97 worth of food.  They are also very stingy (or maybe just with me and they are just profiling me). The lady in front of the couple in front of me got a lot of olives (more than 6) without asking for extra. I asked for olives (with an \"s\") she put one piece of olive on my hummus. Also asked to fill only half of container with hummus so she can put more olive oil....nope! She's so stingy with olive oil (only put two circular dash--that's after I asked for her to put more than just one circular dash so she added one more dash) maybe she thought I just like half a container of hummus just for kicks.   If you have time, go to their other location on Tropicana Ave. The other location has fresher food (atleast with the curry and eggplant salad but just the same with hummus). They are also not stingy and actually put a lot of toppings on curry. Not stingy with olives and olive oil too. I asked for olives at their other location--she put 4 without me asking for extra/more! The other location did not charge me Groupon Tax but idk if they just started that policy so they might also charge it. But still, it is not in the Groupon fine print!!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up some salads and chicken for dinner- the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! On our list of places to order from when visiting vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the bowl with mix of both beef and chicken and it was very satisfying.  The taste was right on point.  The staff are very helpful when it comes to recommendation.  I'm looking forward to returning soon to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just tried take out and it was amazing. I got the chicken schnitzel platter. I could tell it was going to be good before I opened the box. The taste did not disappoint. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. The whole dish was great."}
{"text":"Great food. Chipotle style but for Mediterranean food, my favorite food. Very fresh and tastu. They serve you a lot. 2 can easily share one. Prices are great. Wish there was one by where I live."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see the good reviews, I went with my daughter and wasn't impressed at all. Meat was dry from being out all day on that roaster. Just not good flavor at all. Didn't even take the rest home I threw it away. Not good quality at all to me. Maybe others feel it's great but not sure why... to many other places that are better to go eat at."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the delicious beef kabob platter and the cucumber juice. located close to the strip for a quick uber ride. Highly recommended if you are in the mood for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 5 stars but the lobby was dirty: trash overflowing, dirty floor, soda machine tray overflowing with liquid. Beyond that, the food was really good! Probably even better than The Great Greek! I got the veggie sampler and friend got the steak plate. She said her steak was perfectly seasoned. Hummus was excellent! Overall really good and hoping to try the Tropicana location :)"}
{"text":"Much better than the Sunset Road location! Cleaner, fresher food. The dolmades here taste fresh, while the other location had the fizzy taste like fruit about to turn rotten. Felt like a better selection here, too. The ladies were very on it! Will definitely be back to this location :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why but I keep forgetting about Parsley. Everything I've had here has been very delicious. The food has always been fresh, healthy, full of flavor, and have I mentioned inexpensive. I don't think they had anything over $10 and I'm sure there's a Groupon floating around. My favorite would have to be one of the chicken or steak shawarma wraps. It's so good. Last time there I told myself I was only going to eat half of my wrap of course I ended up eating the entire thing. The setup is like the very efficient Chipotle or Subway style makes Parsley a popular spot for lunch, you're usually in and out.   If you don't like wraps they have other food choices. You can get the same meats from the wrap as a bowl, a plate, a salad, or a baguette. I just prefer the wraps. They also have some delicious looking falafel and hummus plates. I've been really craving some Mediterranean food since Friday this is probably why I'm finally writing this review. Hmm tomorrow I want to stuff my face in some Parsley food. Yeap that sounds like an awesome plan. BTW Parsley is kind of small establishment, so you kind of have to leave when I arrive jk."}
{"text":"Good food!  Can get crowded at regular meal times.  Staff is very friendly and it is a clean place to eat.  Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"So we made a quick phone call on the following day to let them know about the previous over charge. Debbie, the owner, was a very pleasant lady to speak to and was very understanding. She offered to send a check for the difference, but we found it unnecessary since we really like it there and wanted to return anyway. So instead she offered a gift card with more than the difference in cost. We will definitely be going in to try the Beef Curry and more pretty soon. Thank you Debbie! We very much appreciate excellent customer service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Now this place is really good i always drive past it but today i decided to stop an check it out it is really good healthy an fresh"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is definitely not, and beware of their \"loyalty card\", big SCAM!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I was disappointed after looking forward to trying Parsley due to the reviews. Someone put it perfectly-it's the Chipotle of Mediterranean.... We ordered the Chicken Kabob plate (4/5) the Steak Schwarma (1/5), Parsley fries (4/5), tzasiki (3/5) and hummus (3/5) and Baklava (5/5). It's not that it was bad....it was just meh.. With the exception of The Steak Shwarm-they should rename it overcooked splinters of fatty meat that fell through the grill grates. Horrible. The tzasiki and hummus are strictly a matter of my personal taste...but there was a light at the end of the tunnel and that was the baklava! D-lish! I will also note that we ordered delivery so maybe this was the reason the fries were soggy and lukewarm though my Dad liked them. Sadly I believe in my book-this is a one and done....many other Med places that are better in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of hummus or Mediterranean food sadly, but when I want to eat out and feel good about it, parsleys is one of my first considerations.  They have a lot of excellent healthy options like the hummus or chicken skewer plate, although the chicken is a tiny bit dry. And if you're really feeling riskaay you can treat yourself to a nice little check in baklava freebie huhuhu.  Their Groupon deal is also a huge steal, I always make sure I have it handy when I go in. Their portions are decently sized, but make sure you watch what extras you put on your plate because if you don't pick correctly you can get charged extra. Staff is always very nice whenever I stop by as well, I don't honk I've ever gone in once and had a rude person serve me.  Also if youre not on a diet and have to choose between the chicken or steak make sure to get the steak, it's a little extra but flavor is more seasoned and worth it if you aren't in the mood to watch weight."}
{"text":"I have passed this place for a year going to Walgreens. Wanted to try out and finally went in for a menu...   What an awesome place! And the prices are great too!   I've grown accustomed to the falafels here and I normally get the sampler plate (it's 5 items on a mini salad...) and only like $5-6!! I get hummus, eggplant, grape leaves, tabbouleh, and switch the 5th item for something different each time.   Oh almost forgot -- they have a groupon!! Must get 24hrs beforehand, but worth it.   If you're wondering if you should try here, you won't be disappointed.   -1 star because some cooked items aren't great, but thankfully they let me order as side item and I only got a little."}
{"text":"I visit this place lots of time, can't resist to go back once I started.  Food choice: It's like fast food restaurant here, but what they offer here are pretty healthy. As an Mediterranean restaurant, they not only serving kebab, but also curry!!  Curry: they have beef curry and chicken curry, they both taste awesome, each order come with a huge portion, you can eat it for twice.  Meat: kebab includes chicken and beef, you can choose combination of them, which is my way to order, meat taste tender even they cut into small pieces.  Drink: The cucumber drink is not a plus, it's a must, trust me! Super refreshing, sweetness on point."}
{"text":"It was great! Lots of choices, fresh and delicious! Service was great. Humus was e especially good.  I Recommend the parsley fries."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had the shawarma wrap. Its not the real deal if you know shawarma like I do but its decent.  $3 for a very old baklava (dessert) was disappointing. Make it $1 or on the house befor you throw it away.  I'll be back though. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats (google discount codes!). I was happy with the experience. Not sure if it's the restaurant's responsibility, but I would appreciate more pictures of the menu items.   Appetizer size falafel - 6 pieces on top of hummus. Good serving size for the price. Both falafel and hummus a tad too salty. Ate with pita and it was more than satisfactory.   Parsley Nachos with chicken - Big chunks of shredded chicken, feta cheese, tzatziki, and a sprinkle of tomato, cucumber, & cilantro. Seasoned fried pita chips were slightly too salty. Portion can be a meal or appetizer for 2-3 people. Overall pretty good; would order again.  Steak shawarma bowl - thinly sliced steak; good seasoning, but was dry and there were some chewy/grisly pieces. Steak was piled on yellow (saffron? couldn't tell) rice and salad. Also came with a side of tzatziki. This would be great if the meat was better.   \"Beef Kabob\" plate - was expecting cubes of beef, but when I opened the container I was like, \"oh, I guess it's more like kofta (formed ground meat)\". But then it wasn't like any kofta I've had :( the meat had a dry, more congealed texture like a sausage, as a matter of fact, my husband said, \"this kinda tastes like a hot dog\". Plate came with yellow rice, salad, and a side of tzatziki. Would not order again.  2 orders of baklava - this looked and tasted like the baklava a former boss of mine ordered from Sinbad Sweets to give as holiday gifts. Point is, did not look and taste like it was made in-house.   Our order also came with 2 foil packets of pita (4 half pieces each). Not sure which items these were supposed to accompany. They came warm, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Great spot for a healthy salad! I got a salad with chicken and the creamy dressing. They use all fresh ingredients and the meat was very tender! I will be returning"}
{"text":"The meat can use some more SALT---kind of bland, but fresh and clean!!"}
{"text":"I've been in here a couple times now and have never been disappointed! The food is super yummy, the hummus bowl is great!! The service is awesome as well! Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Come every week for taco Tuesday!!! Best Wraps, Falafels, Tacos and even amazing chicken Curry!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch based on a recommendation. The food tasted healthy and flavorful. I got the steak salad. Good portion size.  The reason for the low star rating is for the poor customer service. This was my first time eating here and honestly I don't know much about Mediterranean food. I told the guy behind the counter this and I asked for his recommendation. Instead of telling me some of their popular items, he began to read off the menu (which I don't understand why since I can read it myself). When it was time to pay, another older gentleman was working the register. I showed him my check in (since they had a Yelp check in offer for free baklava) and he asked me for my name to confirm my check in. After I told him, he said he didn't see it on his register. I even showed him my Yelp check in and he kept on saying he couldn't see it even though it was right there on my phone. After awhile he just seem annoyed at the entire situation, which left me feeling confused. He ended the conversation with an attitude like as if he was doing me a favor by giving me a baklava. As I was dining in, the same worker went around and chatted with all the customers (asking how their food was, removing trash/taking their tray). He went to all the table except mine. What's that all about?  Decent food. However, the customer service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little side spot, they'd play bumpin music and serve delicious food! It was like a  Mediterranean version of chipotle! But way yummier! Very generous with portions, we couldn't even finish ours! Wife did not like the baklava but that's just cause it's not her cup of tea, I however thought it was delicious! Definitely stop by for a cheap filling meal!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews. I've only ordered this from Eat 24, so haven't had the dining experience. But the flavors are just okay, they always forget a side of sauce that you've extra ordered, and it took an hour and a half to be delivered. I guess it could have been worse, but still sucked."}
{"text":"Me and read the house. Obvious difference.  I go here quite often, it's always clean. Most of the time very good sometimes they dropped the ball as anyplace lol. In my opinion very very good wraps always looks fresh and clean and their salads are actual salads,  not just a whole bunch of cheap lettuce and a few shredded carrot pieces.   If you like shawarma- definitely try this place."}
{"text":"I was thinking this would be more of a sit down restaurant where you order from the table instead of a chipotleish style of Mediterranean food.  Thought there would be more room inside for eating.  The only thing good I had was the cucumber chiller which I would go back for.  Not so much the food/service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for awhile now and it really never dissapoints.  I've tried several things off the menu and eveything has been consistently delicious. The staff is always so nice and welcoming which is great.  But in all seriousness, you must try the chicken curry. I was really used to just getting a shawarma wrap but one day one of the employees let me sample some of the curry and dizzamn, it's AMAZING. It's a great little spot, can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Go here for lunch all the time, great place to eat if you're a vegan or gluten free. Service can be a bit hectic and inconsistent, but not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Their salads are fresh and have the right flavors.   Wraps are huge even the reg size can be shared with someone.   They have a card every 5th meal ordered the 6th is free!   So if your looking for something fresh healthy and priced just right give them a try! :)"}
{"text":"First review ever.. Visited Parsley as a suggestion of a coworker. Looking for some healthier lunch options... I ordered up the Chicken Shawarma wrap... AWESOME!! This thing is like a street burrito. BIG!. Delicious, Fresh and Healthy! Service is friendly and fast. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is most excellent. I have been coming here for years and the food is always fresh and the service is always friendly. Was disappointed today for pretty much the first time ever though. I asked to have the nachos substituted with a veggie option over meat and was told no. Kinda bummed me out. Will still continue to eat here. Food is sooo worth it. I will just have to pay extra!"}
{"text":"Went here because there was a groupon deal and we love Mediterrainian food. Have to say food is a little more pricey and the options were very strict.  We ended up getting: 1) Falafel side order- Falafel was great, kinda crunchy, only good when hot- not good at home after being heated up (4 come with the side order) 2) Mixture/Sample plate- Got pita, salad- which I asked to substitute for rice but then was told that i had to pay another 1.50 for this substitution, feta, hummus, olives, babaganoosh  -hummus was super garlicy- just the way i like it- very cream and quite a large serving - feta was very salty -olives were in olive oil and very tasty- about 6-7 served - Babaganoosh was excellent- wish i got more 3)Hummus Shawarma Bowl- chicken grilled with salad, hummus and pita (whole wheat) 4) Cucumber house drink- was highly recommended but i couldnt stand the taste wouldnt recommended unless you love the taste of cucumber The food was ok all together but the reason why i give them 5 stars is because the service was supurb. And if you buy the cucumber drink (and love it like my husband did)- you get unlimited refills George knew I was upset about the 1.50$ upcharge on the rice for salad so he brought me out some rice after my hubby and I sat down. Couldnt have been happier!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the store to order two plates. I asked the worker to separate the salad from the rice and the meat like five times. He didn't know if he could do it. He asked another worker and the worker said it was okay to do so. He still didn't understand me. He gave me a salad with no rice. Then gave me rice with meat and no salad. Then tried to combine both rice plates into one when I asked for two separate. If you're confused by now, this was how I felt too. I don't know how else to simply state i wanted two plates with the meat and rice separate from the salad. Please train your workers or at least have more workers working. Placing an order especially in an assembly line type restaurant like this one should not have to take 10 min especially with me being the only person there!  Food was mediocre. I've had better Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The chicken schwarma was way better than the beef in my opinion. It was more moist. Top it with some cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, garbanzo beans, and taziki sauce and you have yourself a meal."}
{"text":"This is Delicious.  Unbelievable that this place exists.  Yummy yummy food. Also fast, and to be honest the people here are so friendly and kind.  Everyone is smiling, like they all LOVE being there making this great food.  I'm falling in love with parsley, and so is my wife.  Will be a regular customer for sure.  Keep doing what your doing."}
{"text":"I was rushed to take my order, on several occasions I was over charged. It would be a better service if the employees could speak English and not rush customers out!!!!"}
{"text":"Right next to 24 hour fitness so we thought we'd give it a shot to eat something a little healthier than a burger.   Tasty! And very friendly staff! I recommend and would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! My family of 5 ordered 2 beef kabob plates and 2 shishkabob plates. So much food! I found it through yelp and so glad i did!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service by Tammy & James. The food is made fresh and have healthy options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Believe the 4.5 stars, the menu here is fantastic. If you have a taste for Mediterranean then Parsley is a must try and should be bookmarked.   We went for the Steak Bowl and the Chicken Curry for our 1st visit, neither disappointed. The flavors are as rich as you would expect from marinated shwarma, joined by a generous serving of basmati rice and greek salad. Lots of topping options favorites like cucumber yogurt, touboli, and tzatziki.  Combo'd up with the Parsley and Feta fries. Crispy and tasty, the fries were a killer side. Looking forward to sampling the hummus here on my next visit, if it's as good tonight's delicious meal this will be my new go-to for fresh Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Wow! I ate one regular chicken wrap and im so full!! It was really tasty, so I cant stop))) next time im gonna try chicken shishkabob bowl, it looks delisious. They also gave free baklava if you check in on yelp)"}
{"text":"Bad customer service.  These guys nickel and dime you to death... and they don't honor their own punch card.  I have numerous friends that won't go with me to this place because of their customer service.  The kabobs are actually pretty good and the food is relatively fresh.  Although the shawarma is very salty - but if you don't mind salty, then, not bad.  Also, they are not open enough hours."}
{"text":"Great food and fresh ! You can even get the salad without dressing mix on it! Great for special dietary needs and requirements!!! Steak is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was led here by Emily R. who posted the most DELICIOUS looking photo of a wrap from Parsley, so I purchased the Groupon and off we went to Parsley. For our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 small children), we ordered a ton of food, but were able to finish it all, and without the Groupon, the total would have come out to about $40.  My husband ordered a large steak shwarma wrap combo on wheat (I love that it is an option), I got the chicken shwarma salad, the kids shared our food plus falafel, and two baklavas (squares, not cigars). When I went to pay, I was told that the combo is not valid with the Groupon. She told me she could charge for the side of fries separately, until I told her to charge the combo separately because the side of fries was $4.00 + change whereas the combo upgrade was $2 + change. She also charged me $.50 for olives on my salad, and $.50 for chickpeas even though the guy said it was free. Also $.50 for tzatziki sauce. They seriously nickel and dime you here. We got a soda cup which came with the combo, but their soda machine doesn't offer water... They do however, have a fridge full of bottled drinks that DOES include water... They also do not freely give out napkins, so you have to wait until someone is available if you want more than the 1 they gave you... It seems like very very cheap management happening in this establishment.   The food was alright. The salad mix came pre-mixed and was very very wet. I like being able to control the amount of dressing on my salad, but overall, the flavors were very fresh and the chicken was alright. My husband's wrap was better than mine which was layered with hummus, their salad mix, and steak. He did not love it however. I enjoyed the couple of bites I took but didn't want the carb bomb that came with the 16\" tortilla. The falafel and hummus were tasty and a generous serving for the price. Lastly, when I ordered the baklava, the girl told me that the cigars have no nuts and only cinnamon. I was confused as to how that could be a baklava, but took her word on it because my son is allergic to peanuts and they were unable to answer \"Do these have peanuts?\" We were later told that they do have nuts in them, although uncertain as to what kind, plus the cinnamon. Whatever. We just got some. There was no honey on them which made the filo dry, but the nut mix inside was yummy. There is just SUCH better baklava other places in town (Manan Bakery!).   Overall, we'll be passing on another visit to Parsley. I think the food looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment several times and loved it. Their falafels are always made fresh. I love how you can just pick and choose what you want to add on to your meal. I do wish it was closer to my home. Whenever I am back in the area I will for sure be coming back here."}
{"text":"amazing. I love that they have a vegan menu. I asked for the felafel salad to be placed in a baguette with the sesame dressing and they were happy to do that. Best felafel sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 7 days. This place is the best and the staff and owners are the nicest people. The food is great and the dinning area is really clean. You can't go wrong at this place. Try the bbq baguette or the falafel plate."}
{"text":"I ended up stopping here spontaneously and did not know what to expect, but I will for sure be returning.  My friend and I ordered the appetizers of baba ghanoush and hummus with pita bread.  They were both amazing, although I preferred the baba ghanoush.  The prices are great too, and the hummus cost and portion size is comparable to what's in a regular health food store, but Parsley's is fresher and better."}
{"text":"WARNING!! I am in an rather large office complex in Green Valley and we just added Parsley to the \"DO NOT CALL\" list for any delivery service whatsoever.  The bland food came cold and messy. Most of the order was wrong and they forgot plastic ware, napkins, sauces, pita and dressing. The falafel was hard as a  hockey puck and way over cooked. Parsley is goi g down hill. We I'll never call his unorganized place again. They just missed out on a huge complex! Everyone was emailed the updated \"DO NOT CALL\" list and Parsley is now a part of that.  The food is not worth the time and aggravation. They suck! When I called then to let them know they sent someone over and it too 30 minutes. What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef kabob. Honestly I've had better but the service was excellent. The whole plate was very oily. Might just want to skip this joint. I'll take another place with gyros any day."}
{"text":"So, I was in the mood for a good gyro.  I typed \"gyro\" into Yelp, and this place was top on the list.  We headed there, and guess what?  They don't have gyros!!!   I got over it and ordered the Steak Shwarrma.  Well, my wife and I were both unimpressed.  The steak was very dry.  It was almost like warm beef jerky.  Flavor wise, the whole thing was utterly bland.  Sadly, the marinated carrots were the most flavorful thing we had.  My five year old son wanted nothing to do with the place.  They only offer three kids options. Perhaps the salads are the main draw here, but I am not going to be taking that chance considering the number of places to eat in town."}
{"text":"This is the very best Mediterranean cuisine we've had EVER. The owner made our experience even better with his kindness and gracious attitude. Fresh food, impeccable service...what else could you want!!"}
{"text":"First time here.. absolutely delish! Food was excellent.. the man behind country explained everything to me on the menu and how it all works. Excellent customer service. Reminded me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. Was soooo good and will defo be back for more!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! They staff is always so friendly and willing to let you try things! The price is right and the food is great. A healthy option to fast food and 10x better."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Never really tried Mediterranean food before and it didn't disappoint! For the portion sizes I think it was pretty reasonably priced. Loved their steak bowl with the cucumber yogurt  definitely going here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The falafel dishes are unbelievably delicious and are vegan.... Good and fast way to eat healthy, feel good, and not break the bank. I will without a doubt be back very very soon and I can't wait to introduce my kids to it!! Strongly recommend..."}
{"text":"Go here! Not the hala guys! They  actually use the the vertical grills to cook the meat. Much more variety and that red sauce \"like fire\" love it."}
{"text":"Tried this place at the recommendation of my barber and glad I followed through.  The Basics:  Big Letter \"A\" from the health dept, clean restrooms, friendly staff and well kept and clean restaurant.  Small place.  Portions are very generous--enough to have dinner and leftovers for lunch.  I had the Hummas Shawarma Bowl with chicken and steak. Man it was good.  I stole some of my wife's Red Quinoa Salad.  We also had the Parsley Fries.  Everything was delish.  We're gonna be regulars!"}
{"text":"I found the need to update my review because I find myself loving this place every time I come in here. This is a 5 star place, not 4 like my original review.  The food quality hasn't changed any time I've been here, the people behind the counter have always been pleasant, the baklava is great, and the extra dollar in price always ends up being worth it.  My recommendation: chicken or steak bowl with all the extra veggies on it (cucumbers, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots), feta cheese, and extra sauce. That and a baklava roll and you're in heaven."}
{"text":"Delicious! I order the falafel salad or falafel bowl every time for about $9. I can usually get one full meal and a snack out of one order. The place is small but there is some seating outside. My only issue with this place is that they tend to ignore to-go orders. Sometimes I stand there for a few minutes before anyone even notices me. They are pretty busy though during lunch hours. Plus, It's always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after purchasing a Groupon deal. Long line for food and service was relatively quick. Food was delicious but gave 4 stars bc there is very little information on what comes in each entree.  I highly recommend the chicken shawarma. Got it with double meat and it was very good--enough for 2 lunches for me! I thought the parsley fries were okay, good effort on the idea.  Clean restaurant with a modern feel. Bathrooms were clean too and parking was available and easy. Recommend for a healthier lunch option for sure, with good food!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Parsley for nearly 2 years now. I have never had a bad experience here! The food is the best I've had in Vegas. The customer service is phenomenal, the employees are amazing... I honestly can't say anything negative about this place. Very clean and happy crew. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!"}
{"text":"For being a fast-food sort of place it was really very good.  I got a \"Beef Baguette\", which is pretty much what it sounds like: hummus, beef, and tabbouleh on a baguette -- certianly a bit nicer than the standard pita!  Definately worth going to if you're looking for something cheap, but not really worth a trip in and of itself."}
{"text":"Yo. After all that buffets full of saturated fats and shit my body was yearning for something you know simple and clean. I wanted greens (you never hear that from me that often). This place is a great break away from all the Las Vegas food. It's prime good food. Easy not too wallet breaking nice."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Vegas! Perfect place for vegans and shwarma lovers alike. I suggest the falafel wrap with hot sauce, all the veggies, and add the roasted eggplant and dolma on the side!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps going down hill. They tried to charge me $1 for an extra spoonful of tomatoes. What a joke! Not to mention they charged me a \"Groupon tax\" of $2 last time I was here. Isn't the entire point of Groupon to save money? Seems kinda sketchy that they would charge me extra to do it."}
{"text":"Update of my old 5 Star review. I ordered online last time. This time I ordered in person the food was dry and bland and the customer service was worst . They covered my plate in sauce when I asked for it in the side it was already poured in. I had tossed the whole bowl away because it looked like cereal or slob covered in milk thanks not appetizing at all."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here, it was awesome. I brought the boo here to try it and she loved it.   The girls behind the counter were an amazing help. I redeemed a Groupon offer, they knew exactly what it was and how to execute it. They let us try samples and helped us through the long decision making process.   Lastly, the food was delicious. We had a chicken/beef curry bowl, and the beef/chicken that rotates on the spit and parsley fries. Mmmmm. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it, the They give you so much for you money it's like getting two meals for one.  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been going to the E. Sunset location for sometime, but today I met my daughter at this location and it was great.  Nicer spot than the other local.  It's roomier and just newer looking.  The food is so good.  We both had the steak salads and they were so good.  This was my daughters first time eating at Parsley and she really liked it.  Also, make sure you get the cucumber lime drink!"}
{"text":"My month of vegetarian is going well and this place is going to be a new regular. The Falafels are amazing!!!!! My BFF got the beef curry and was not disappointed. Overall a great experience that I can't wait to enjoy again :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and friendly service. The food is super fresh. Note: the regular wraps are very big, but great for saving the 2nd half dor later!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it is wonderful! The vegetarian sampler plate is my favorite, but how do you decide? I love their stuffed grape leaves, and if I could buy them by the dozen I would. The falafel is also very good. The amount of food and the quality of the food is fantastic, and then with the low price they charge, it is a WIN/WIN/WIN!   A shout out to the staff! Friendly, helpful and offer great suggestions on what to choose. Oh, and when they mean \"Spicey\" about the carrots, they aren't kidding lol."}
{"text":"Fair price low quality food. Service sucks, cashiers have attitude. Very cheap and very stingy people here. Also why have workers working with food with no knowledge of the ingredients. This is my third and final visit, it's upsetting how excited I was that a shawarma place was opened so close to me, oh well. Also, very stingy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their food is incredible and the prices could be a whole lot worse. Everything is very fresh and clearly prepared daily if not more often. This is our spot for delicious healthy food! The staff is so nice and the couple that owns the place are just wonderful too. The menu is fine for meat eaters but the real magic happens for us Vegans. Try it guys! Try it often! The cucumber chiller is a MUST too!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, Joe the manager always has a smile on his face and makes us feel welcome. The flaffel bowl is what I always get and the quality and quantity of my meal is a good portion. Greta food with great eats"}
{"text":"Great service and authentic tasting. Little pricey but has great flavors. Nice and clean new place. The old restaurant burnt down so it's newly remodeled. Must check this place out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean Food spot in town. I go there everyday and order the Tuna wrap. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. We ordered the falafel and the first time they were overly cooked we could not bite into them. I asked the staff to remake them and they gladly did without hesitation and apologized for the first round. We also ordered the steak and chicken kebab plates. The beef was marinated and tasty but the chicken was just ok."}
{"text":"In an area surrounded by chain restaurants and mediocre food, this place is an oasis!!!!! Fresh ingredients, friendly people, and a unique concept that you won't find anywhere else.  I come here almost everyday for lunch. I've tried everything on the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. You can count on getting exactly what you need for your lunch or dinner fix. It's quick so you'll be in and out in no time."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. They have their steak and chicken on a rotary shawarma machine and they carve out the meat fresh when you order it. My favorite dish is the steak bowl, which comes with a ton of rice and veggies along with extra toppings you can order for about .50 each."}
{"text":"You can't beat the falafel wrap for $5. It's huge, almost two meals! And made fresh always ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor. My favorite is the wraps. They also have bowls, plates, salads, vegetarian options and daily specials. I love that their fries are cooked fresh to order and I like that they offer a combo option unlike some Mediterranean fast food places. Oh and currently they offer a groupon special, $8 for $16. Love it!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a good experience and I enjoyed it, except for the fact that we had to wait 15 minutes for the chicken kebabs but the girl at the counter didn't even notify us that they were done, and instead we had to wait in line all over again while other people ordered them...  Most of the stuff costs extra and it seemed like the people behind the counter were in a huge rush. I asked for cucumbers and the girl curtly said \"there are already cucumbers in the salad\".   Tasty and reasonably priced, but not a fan of the workers."}
{"text":"I've been to parsley a couple of times and lemme just say that the food is delicious! It's so fresh and it's a great place for vegetarians and vegans because the falafels is a must try! The falafel plate is so delicious. The rice is AMAZING. I wish I had more. The salad was ok.. just a regular salad with chopped cucumbers and tomatoes. There was a light dressing but not much. So I added the tahini sauce on top and it was delicious. The falafels was so crispy just the way I like it. If you want some fresh Mediterranean food you have to stop here!"}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, inexpensive and healthy. A little hidden gem of a healthy option on modern Mediterranean food. Food was great and hot. Their lay out was clean, I ordered the chicken shis kebab plate. They had the raw chicken marinating in the fridge, then they cooked it on the open grill right there. It takes 10mins so if your starving be prepared. Will def recommend or make a second trip if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"After waking up late on a crisp winter Saturday I felt no desire to cook let alone make a single cup of coffee. Instead I headed to Starbucks which took longer to get to than making a cup of coffee. However, you rarely consider those details when crafting a laziness inspired plan.   I arrived at the good ole, overpriced, over roasted, push button coffee preparation establishment aka Starbucks and picked up my drinks. Luckily these were compliments of Visa and didn't come out of my pocket. Thank you Visa.   After taking a a few sips of the very strong cold brew my stomach quickly protested by aching. It was hungry and seeing that I hadn't fed it in 18 hours the coffee was making sure I didn't forget about its current state of emptiness. Enter Parsley the modern Mediterranean restaurant conveniently next door. I quickly read a few reviews and decided that 4.5 stars for a suburban eatery is typically worth checking out.   Once inside I approached the counter and bluntly asked the smiling woman to \"school me\" as I'd never been there and really just wanted a gyro. A sandwich made with lamb or steak, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese and cucumber yogurt dressing all contained within a warm and delicious pita bread. However, this gem of a meal wasn't on the menu. I don't really understand why as a well prepared Gyro can bring a tear to my eye. I wonder if a Gyro is really a low brow type of sandwich that higher end places avoid. I don't know.   After getting a sample of their steak and chicken I promptly chose the steak.    The steak bowl which came with a generous bed of lettuce, a healthy serving of yellow #5 rice (I'm sure it was natural, albeit blinding yellow). Atop the rice was what looked to be 4-5 ounces of delicious steak followed by dressing of your choice. My choice was cucumber yogurt which again was very good. For an additional dollar which is my only complaint, you could get feta cheese, extra dressing, olives and a few other items. They are so generous with the portions you'd think they continue that over to the items you pay extra for. Nope!! I got approx, 12 cents worth of feta and I'm not talking about retail pricing. It's almost as bad as Subway charging so much extra for a quarter of an avocado. (It's an avocado, not rare caviar!)  Well, despite the peasant serving of feta I sat down and thoroughly enjoyed my whole meal. I chose 5 stars because the food is really well prepared, the staff is friendly, the restaurant was super clean and well decorated. The cheese did impact my opinion but I can't let it take a star away and potentially steer some 5 star snob away from this place.  I will be back but I may have to bring my own feta! Is that weird?"}
{"text":"It was so good the first time that I went back the next day...I totally love this place...first time had the Steak Shwarma plate with hummus and a side order of Falafel...everything was fresh to order and amazing...next day had the beef kabab bowl with hummus and an order of their special fries...I didn't think it was possible but second day was even better...have to admit best place I've found in Vegas for Mediterranean food...can't wait to go back and try something else"}
{"text":"Everyone back in SoCal has been going crazy over The Halal Guys but I don't think these two places are that much different from each other (minus the hot sauce and white sauce from The Halal guys).   I bought a $16 voucher on groupon (paid $7.50 because of a coupon code) and ended up paying $2 out of pocket for a beef and chicken bowl.   What's the difference between a bowl and a plate? The girl working told us that the plate separates everything while a bowl has salad first then rice, whatever veggies you put on and then the meat.   The salad had a light vinegrette dressing on it, not sure what it was but it definitely wasn't heavy. The salad we got looked fresh and not all wilted. I asked the girl working what people can put in their bowls and she said pickled carrots, cabbage, and garbanzo beans. I love their picked carrots!! Ask for them on the side because you'll get more that way. We didn't, and they were so stingy with the carrots!! I was afraid they weren't going to give us a lot of meat because of the way she was cutting the meat but it turned out to be a good amount. They have two different sauces, one is a cucumber sauce and the other is a sesame sauce... Not sure what the names were but I got both sauces. My friend and I both liked the cucumber one more, the sesame one was kind of plain for us. But you can try both and see which one you like better. If you want hot sauce, just ask for it and they'll give it to you.   Without the groupon the beef/ chicken plates or bowls would be $8.99. They have some vegetarian and vegan options too and good deals on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"My favorite shish kabob  food in town. I work down the street and eat here all the time. Yigal is super nice and I love coming here"}
{"text":"This was such a nice place for a quick bite of fresh and delicious food! Very affordable, and I was shocked by how generous their portion was. I shared a chicken bowl and a side of parsley fries with my boyfriend, and we were both stuffed by the end of the meal. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Their cucumber chiller was also super refreshing, which would be great for summer! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The falafel was very good, not as good as Olive Hookah, but definitely comes in second as far as tasty falafel in Las Vegas. The falafel plate came with SIX pieces PLUS hummus for under $4.00. That is an awesome deal. The hummus was very good too. It tasted different than any hummus I've had in Las Vegas. My son had the kids chicken shawarma plate and he loved it. So did I as I tasted a few spoonfuls from his plate. The place is very clean, HOWEVER, what I didn't like, (and this almost made me walk out if it weren't for the fact I was too lazy to cook and wanted to get home in a hurry) was the smell of a wet rag when you walked in. It was a very prominent smell and it was gross."}
{"text":"The Tzatziki dtessing was the bomb! Just be ready for a long line, but very friendly staffs!"}
{"text":"The employees were very helpful and their shawarma is the closest it could get to the real thing. My family and I had the opportunity to reside in Qatar for several years as I was growing up. There were those days that mom got lazy to cook dinner so going to a shawarma joint was almost always the alternative choice. I've been to a lot of spots in town offering shawarma, trying to find that distinct taste. The search is over! This place offers not only the best shawarma but also nostalgia with every bite. Parsley is my one and only shawarma spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is so fresh. So many good and healthy choices. Big portions. Lots of different items to choose from . Great tasting food. Love it"}
{"text":"Ordered their falafel plate yesterday and I couldn't eat it because it was so oily . The falafel was also on the harder side . Very disappointed as I saw the Israeli owner and thought this would throw me back to amazing food of Israel but it did not . So basically I paid $9.72 for hard oily falafel, a little salad and rice that I couldn't eat . Kinda overpriced iMO . Oh I had to pay a dollar extra for hummus since I didn't want tahini or tziki ..... No substitutes ? What happened chick peas cost too much now ? Get out of here .  ."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff, clean atmosphere. They call their kafta beef kabob, so if you are expecting pieces of beef you will get ground beef instead. everything was delicious. Beware of the carrots if you dont like spicy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious inexpensive food. I ordered the chicken bowl with tsatskiki sauce. Just delicious. Definitely coming back to try other stuff.   Update: still delicious on 2/18/17"}
{"text":"I came here because of the groupon deal they were friendly neat shawarma was very good but chicken needs little bit flavor in there.  I think they made a mistake on groupon because I got the deal $16 value $9.50 but my total was $18 with the deal I should pay only $2 extra but I end up paying $9 extra I think they are wrong with that  They should correct their calculation"}
{"text":"Delicious!   We had the salad w veggies. And the steak and chicken bowl! New favorite in Vegas ! We taste tested just about everything and there was nothing that we tasted that wasn't good!  And the girl that helped us was so patient  and super helpful!"}
{"text":"Still the best Mediterranean food & falafel in town. First visit at this location. Service was quick and friendly. Ordered $16+ worth of food for $9.50 groupon! Generous portions. The chicken or steak shawarma Pita nachos with spicy hummus, tsaziki (sp?), feta, veggies, etc just topped all Asada nachos, period. My eyes rolled back. LoL If you like falafel, they have the best in town in my opinion! Tasty and not mushy like others I've tried.  #postworkout #treatmeal   I thought of giving 4 stars but it's actually a good thing they don't serve a lot of my fave Greek desserts here or I'll double my weight in no time! LoL  You can order online. Dine Indoor and outdoors. 2 locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have visited Parsley twice since moving to Spring Valley. The staff has been friendly and while the appetizers have been good, both times I have been extremely disappointed with the steak schwarma.  It is cooked on an gyro machine and the way the sheer it off, much of the meat is either overcooked or contains a great deal of fat and grissle.  The dressing used on the salad is good but as it is prepared and tossed in advance, it breaks down quickly with the lettuce losing its texture and both wilting and browning. Quality could easily improve by preparing fresh during slower periods as opposed to using what was left over from the dinner rush.  At 16 bucks for the combo with appetizer and drink, it felt quite expensive for the lack of quality and there are many alternatives. With better food preparation and attention to what is served, Parsley could certainly excel. Three stars for friendly service and good appetizers. Ok with a Groupon but at full price I will continue to explore other venues."}
{"text":"Loved this food!  I've traveled in the Middle East, and these guys definitely know their stuff.  Large portions, food was ready quickly, and the staff were super nice.  They even gave us a free appetizer platter since some of our group had never had Mediterranean food before.  Would 100% come back here!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in town! They kind of serve their food in a Chipotle style, but of course, it's Mediterranean food. This place is sooo good, I was on a diet, and my husband and I normally tell each other what we eat when we are away from each other, but he didn't tell me-- he literally cheated on me by going to Parsley, ordered their beef curry over rice, and tried to hide the fact so he didn't want to feel bad about not getting me anything or having any leftover..."}
{"text":"The food is good. I have tried the eggplant it's delicious.. I got the salad bowl today, and it Didn't have much flavor..  I got  charge an extra $1 for feta and $1 for extra tasiki sauce. Didn't get much more either..  Its definitely convenient and healthy alternative..  The cucumber drink is my favorite. Overall food was good but salad needs a balsamic or an olive and lemon dressing (something to give it more flavor) also More feta would be great."}
{"text":"*first timers* my husband and I got steak kabob plates and it was delicious. The salad for starters was freshly made and perfectly dressed! The steak kabob was extremely moist and super yummy. The pita bread that came with the plate was ok, on the dry side and you could tell it wasn't fresh. The humus was creamier than normal humuses but delicious. The only downside to the visit was everything was extra. Want humus for your pita? $1 extra. Want cheese on your salad? $1 extra. Want home made pita? $1.50 extra.. overall, good good food!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Parsley for delivery on a Saturday night after a long day of moving. We ordered the Mediterranean nachos, hummus appetizer, and the chicken plate. Delivery was even faster than was estimated. With the nachos we opted for the tzatziki sauce and with the chicken the tahini. We loved both dishes and sauces. The hummus was very flavorful and a large portion.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and the salad was a great compliment."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place with great service.  This food is pure nourishment for body, mind and soul.  A feeling of peaceful dining.  Their cucumber chillers are fantastic. You know you are doing something good for you and the family when you fuel up here."}
{"text":"Great service, and the food is generally pretty good. One suggestion would be to lower the amount of salt in the Hummus, it's overwhelming."}
{"text":"Parsley is going to be added to my list of favorite healthy places to eat! I drive past this place probably daily and have been meaning to try it out! While I was leaving Starbucks on my lunch break I thought to myself okay, LET'S DO THIS! I am sure glad that I did!  When I walked in I was greeted right away and offered to ask any questions on the menu! Great service already and the transaction barley even started! I was impressed! So after gazing at this menu for about 5 minutes I finally decided to go with the Chicken Parsley Bowl! Yum! As I was watching the employee put together this bowl I noticed how fresh the ingredients were and I was adding stuff I never even heard of because I'm a risk taker like that! Glad I did because the entire bowl was amazing! The bowl is completely worth the ($8.49) and I'm not going to lie before I ordered this I said to myself this better be good for the price! The portions are very well worth it! A bowl of great flavors! I will be back very soon to try out the wraps! Which they offer in a steak option as well!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for the first time over the summer. I wasn't a yelper back then. But now that I am, I need to tell everyone how amazing this place is! The service is excellent. Everyone who works there is so friendly and always smiling. And the food is to die for! I usually get the chicken wrap or curry, sometimes the parsley nachos. Everything is delicious. We go every other week now. Only downside is that they close at 8pm on weekdays :/"}
{"text":"I go here probably twice a month after a gym session since 24 hour fitness is in the same parking lot. Ive only tried two main menu items here and both are really good. I always get a shcwarma baguette with either chicken or steak. Personally, I like the steak better. Anyways...the baguette is awesome with house made salad, hummus, salsa, and tziki sauce. They have a lot of different options here for side too. Ive had the hummus and pita chips, the egg plant salad, and tziki...but my favorite thing is their Parsley fries. Also, their cucumber cooler drink that they make here is AWESOME very very very refreshing. The only thing I dont like is the check out process...wish it was more streamlined. The people are all pretty nice here though 0=)"}
{"text":"It's like a chipotle with Mediterranean food. Fresh ingredients and tasty. Good amount of food for the price. Meat had a good flavor. It was perfect after spending the weekend at EDC."}
{"text":"My wife works just down the street from Parsley and has been quite a few times, usually raves about it too. Our recent visit, which was my first, was nothing to rave about...  From the moment we walked in, to the second we walked out, there was no customer service whatsoever. Ya know how a lot of places ask you if you'd been there before, and if not, they'll explain it to you. Not at Parsley. They won't even say hi to you and ask what you want, just kinda blankly stare at you until you figure it out on your own.  I went with the steak bowl, and moving down the line felt like I should've thrown my wallet over the counter and walked away. You want extra meat? $3-$4. Extra sauce? That'll cost the you a buck. A little cheese? $1. Olives sound good? Another $1. Everyone likes a dollop of hummus on their bowl, right? You guessed it, fork over another Washington. The bowl already cost $9 and let me tell you, they aren't heavy handed with really anything in there, especially the meats. If you're feeling hungry, I feel bad for ya son...because it won't be a cheap lunch.  Was the bowl good? Eh, it was alright. The flavors were decent, and everything tasted fairly fresh. But all it really is, is a salad with a few toppings on it. Certainly not worth nearly $10. Add on crappy service with rude employees, I'll pass on Parsley."}
{"text":"This is the best place I've ever ate at I can say again and again that free time or no free time you should come to parsley for lunch or dinner and don't matter what time the service is always fast!"}
{"text":"Other than the portion size the place is just meh. I'm not sure if they are going for the Mediterranean or the German thing here. The gyros are huge so I'll give them that but.....The status bar for a gyro is set at Stephanos for me so parsley didn't add up."}
{"text":"We were looking for something fresh and fast and found it at Parsley's. Amazing staff and absolutely delicious food. Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, but with the add ons can quickly become pricy. Service is friendly, but be prepared to repeat yourself to ensure your order is correct."}
{"text":"I had previously dined at the Sunset location so I had an idea of what to expect. This locations carries through on good food, but the service was rough. They weren't rude as much as they were inattentive. Perhaps a class in active listening would help them out.   We got: - Chicken Curry - just ok, luckily helped considerably by salt and the green hot sauce - Chicken Wrap - with hummus, tomatoes, cucumbers, salad, yogurt sauce and feta - Falafel with hummus - Parsely Fries  It is strange how the cheese is included on the fries but you pay extra for it on the wrap...when they give you barely a dusting of it.   Overall, a nice place to stop for a bite. Just be prepared to repeat yourself 3, 4, 5 times when ordering and double check your food."}
{"text":"Easy five star place for me. I'm a Parsley pusher:  The food is fresh, healthy and delicious. You can't go wrong here.  I usually go with the shwarma chicken wrap, but I'm also a fan of the specials. Last time I had the chicken curry which was out of this world flavorful. The closest I've found to something I enjoyed in Morocco. The seasoned fries are good which isn't a good thing for me and my bikini so I pass on that goodness MOST of the time. Also a fan of the falafel. It's the best I've ever had. Just dip that lovin' in their homemade tzakiki and you are straight money!   The staff is always friendly and accommodating. No attitudes here. Just smiles and quick service. Also, the restaurant itself is always spotless. Only prob is they close at 8pm when I am still unwinding and not ready to grub, yet. No biggie.   Do yourself and whoever sees you naked a favor and get your Parsley on."}
{"text":"Tammy & James Are Awesome I Love coming to Parsley They are Super 5 Star  The Food Looks So fresh everything looks like freshly made!  Best Place"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we split a Groupon for this place, so I decided to try it out with her tonight on a whim. Best. Decision. Ever. If you've never been there, it's basically a Mediterranean Chipotle-style restaurant where you order at the counter for dine in or take out. We split the Parsley fries with feta, the loaded nachos (on house made pita chips), and a steak wrap. The wrap was good, but the nachos and fries were out of this world. The ingredients were really fresh and the menu offered plenty of choices without being overwhelming. Super friendly staff and quick service made for a win-win(-win) dining experience. Bonus: the sweet lady working there also gave us free take-home samples of the chicken curry. I didn't try mine because I was so full already, but my friend said it was also delicious. :) I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went back there and it seems they went through some revamp. They also changed the name. The food is different and just ok now, that great taste is gone :("}
{"text":"I was invited with some of my co-workers Josh, Kate and Kyle. They 3 have been to Parsley before and told me that I needed to try it. I took there word for it, and I was very impressed I must say myself. Fresh food, fast service, great customer service and great taste. I told other co-workers about Parsley, and I'm coming back for lunch tomorrow. The chicken gyro with the hummus is amazing."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food made by your own. Foods is so good and fresh here and they're cooking so fast. Location is good too it neat by everything you want around here."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by this place and let me just say the beef kabob is the BEST IVE EVER TASTED!! Excellent deal with groupon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at affordable prices. Service is excellent as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This place is oh my gosh , so amazing !!!! By far one of the best Mediterranean places I have ever had. I got a large wrap with chicken and steak shawarma packed with all sorts of delicious toppingsThe portions are good for the price , I will be back soon. Too bad there's not one out in LA , it'd be my favorite spot! This place deserves more than 5 stars! The line cook was very friendly and super helpful, he explained the menu very thoroughly. Great food and customer service"}
{"text":"The falafel bowl was delish! I ordered the combo with the cucumber drink and parsley fries... Yum! Good food, good service, I'm a happy camper :-)"}
{"text":"I went there with a few times with friends for lunch since we drove by this place many times and wanted to give it a try. I have to say that this is a pretty good place.  This place is located on Pecos Road not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour. Keep in mind that this place is very small.  We had chicken wraps and falafel plates and they all tasted good. The price is also reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that.   In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Thank you for replying.  I wonder if the issue we had was just due to the person behind the counter, and not management in general.  I'm glad to hear you are the same owners as before.  I've always enjoyed the food there and was really bummed at our last experience there."}
{"text":"I came back knowing that my experience would be better considering last time, I got the burnt outside of the steak. This time when I came back, I did not get that part and I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. The steak was soft and had flavor to it as opposed to last time. It's definitely worth the visit and the best part is that it is in the same plaza as 24 Hour Fitness, perfect for a post workout meal!"}
{"text":"I've only been here 2-3 times and the customer service has just been okay. BUT today the guy was clearly not wanting to be at his job. Rude, short and very pushy. Asking me the same question 5x under a minute. With this dead look in his eye. I don't appreciate being approached in a pushy manner. The food is good but definitely not dealing with the people who work here. Rather go to a different Mediterranean spot in town. You leave the rude atmosphere not even wanting to eat the food you just got."}
{"text":"I had a steak salad with carrot, garbanzo beans and hummus. the line was a little chaotic but the food was good."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic!! The falafels were the best I've ever had! The falafels had the triple win of excellent texture, flavor & temperature!  The hummus was ultra smooth! The babaganoush was the best I've ever had! It seemed very fresh with a perfect blend of garlic and eggplant flavors! The weakest part of the meal was the pita bread. They were fine, but nothing special. It just seemed like store bought pitas heated in a toaster. (Thus 4 stars instead of 5.)"}
{"text":"Very Friendly and cheap!  I thought the meat was great as was the sauces.  Some of the vegetables were meh but thats just my opinion.  Overall I am surely coming back"}
{"text":"Love that they don't buy the pre-made blocks of steak and chicken like other Mediterranean restaurants. They build them themselves in-house! I love the Israeli style of seasoning and prep. This place is aces!"}
{"text":"Great little shop! Staff were friendly and helpful with delicious food prepared just the way we wanted. Definitely recommend stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"Parsley never fails to satisfy.  I usually go to the one on the west side but the one on Sunset and Pecos is great too.  I had the falafel appetizer and a small steak wrap for lunch.  Very tasty and satisfying.  And I used Yelp to pre-order so it was ready as soon as i walked in the door, great option for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT and I want one in my hood asap... Fresh, fast food.  Delicious Mediterranean goodness.  We were so happy with our rice plates.  Yummy shawarma!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! It has become the only place I can get tabouli and hummus that is perfect every time! The salads are beautiful and an incredible value as they are packed with fresh toppings of your choice. Fresh homemade pita chips, delicious baklava, and cucumber cooler drink (I want this recipe!) are all to die for. I love the vegetarian options as well as the shawarma. A+++++."}
{"text":"Best and freshest tasting Mediterranean food I think I've ever had. The Falafel is insane. We were in town for 2 days ate lunch here the first day then drove way out of our way to have lunch the next day. Favorite place in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is my go to Mediterranean restaurant when on the go. The Greek salad is my favorite and completely gluten free (without the pita of course) Very resonably priced also and very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service very reasonable prices.  Our favorite Middle Eastern place in town by far"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everytime I want a healthy alternative I stop here! Or sometimes just to take a baklava with a cucumber water!"}
{"text":"It's like Mediterranean chipotle! Food is delicious and fresh.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the dressing situation on salad.  They need oil and vinegar or something like that before yogurt sauce."}
{"text":"Meat looks not fresh. Today, I saw review and I first time went to Parsley. The meat( beef) is very old.some of them are very dry and very hard. Customer service is very low. No greetings no smiles. We asked only we want rice is separate bowl(because the kids doesn't eat vegetable). They said no. That is same things but they still keeping to say no. So I had to separate by my self. The French fries are farrrr a way to be cocked Mediterranean way with smelled old oil. We will not recommend to my friends especially from Mediterranean or Middle East. We couldn't enjoy.  The music inside was  too laud ( like a nightclub)by the cashier I couldn't hear what service lady said.so we eat out side. My husband has Mediterranean and middle eastern  blood line. He eat 5 spoons only. I feel so bad to come here. I can't understand why so many good reviews. May be I am wired.Or today is worst day of service and taste. Check it out yourself and let' us know."}
{"text":"The hummus is absolutely on point, the taziki sauce is thin, the pita bread isn't fresh at all or warmed up even. The meat is subpar, it has entry level flavor. Def don't get your moneys worth. The veggies were all fresh and tasty! Your plate will get way more rice and basic salad on it tho. As well as don't ask any one behind the counter besides Carlos what anything is or ask for suggestions they just stare at you like they're on who wants to be a millionaire. The owner is in there going ham on how to clean the already clean floors, instead of asking customers how it is. Def wouldn't recommend this place to my dying mother."}
{"text":"Love this place! Since moving here from NY, I haven't really found a Mediterranean place that was satisfactory but this is pretty great. The veggies are super fresh and the chicken is never dry. We ordered a shish kabob chicken bowl, a chicken wrap, and a falafel plate.  The falafel was perfectly crunchy and their tzatziki sauce paired with it beautifully.  My mom took one look at the wrap and said she would only eat half. However, she enjoyed it so much she finished all of it anyway. My husband also enjoyed the shish kabob plate and even though he's not a big fan of veggies, he scarfed it all down.   This place would have definitely been 5 stars if it weren't for the service. Out of the three ladies that were there, only one was nice and helpful. The cashier with curly hair was extremely rude and kept asking if I wanted anything else while I was still giving my order to her coworker. I'd still go back though!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean quick food.  Comfortable atmosphere.   Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I came here with a living social deal $14, and it served me well. It looks and feels like any fast food Mediterranean style place, which is to say that it was rather unimpressive. This is the sort of place you go for a quick pick up, or carry out while you sit at home and watch Netflix or a sports game.  Service was fair, no complaints there. One big complaint I do have is that the restaurant offers NO LAMB. How can you call yourself a Mediterranean grill and have no lamb as an option? I was really craving a gyro or at least a lamb kabob and was unable to have one. They basically offer 4 options for adult eaters: Beef shawerma, Chicken Shawerma, Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob-- each available in wrap, sandwich, salad, or plate form. The plate is for a larger appetite, the wrap will suffice a medium appetite. We tried the chicken shawerma salad and beef shawerma plate. They add a Tahini dressing that they keep in a plastic squeeze bottle, much like you would find at a Subway. It was tasty stuff but honestly it was yet another reminder of how authentic this place ISN'T. Real tahini is slathered onto things or served in a bowl because it should not have such a creamy, dressing like consistency.    I don't mean to sound so harsh because the food IS actually pretty tasty and I LIKED it a lot more than I like eating at most of the big corporate fastfood joints that I no longer support. The salad they serve has garbanzo beans and a tasty tangy dressing.  Big compliments to the spicy paste. The green and red stuff ( the name of which escapes me) are both quite good options. The red really packs a punch so don't get it unless you're an adventurous spicy eater like myself. That alone makes this place worth coming to if you've got a craving for spicy and meaty.  They serve pickled carrots with the salad and the helping of shawerma is pretty generous. As I write this review, I admit to feeling quite stuffed. It's a fair value for what you pay but unless I was already out here in the area, (cough--Sunrise Coffee--cough) I can't honestly say I'd be craving them badly enough to drive out here. I would come back again with another coupon deal though."}
{"text":"Walked in not know how the place worked and the people were very friendly! They accommodated to my needs (I wanted a taste of everything) and were very generous with their portions. Some highlights were the chicken, the falafels and the baba ganoush. The chicken was nice and juicy (a little oily) but very good. The falafels were moist and fried to perfection and the baba was insane! I have a huge soft spot for Mediterranean food and this certain did it justice."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of Shawarmas until I came here. I purchased the groupon as a quick dinner meal after the gym during the week when I had no time to cook. Went there not sure what to expect but I was delightfully surprised. The food is flavorful and delicious. Those pickled carrots or whatever they were are awesome. I love it. Anyways, great experience prompted me to get another groupon. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews about this place and I do not understand why this place does not get 5 Stars overall.  Service : I think from my humble opinion that the staff is really friendly . I have been eating there for over a year now and I have witnesses some of the customers being utterly rude to the staff. Respect the people around you and especially those who make your food. I have never had a concerns with the staff and the Manager is always working to keep the place clean and friendly. Food : The variety of the menu and the quality is great. It has always tasted good to me and the way I wanted It. Healthy choice"}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety. Falafel, shawarma, curry. Lots of fresh sides like baba ganoush, tabouli, etc. I ordered a falafel plate, really nice to see the falafel fried fresh, first was a salad layer, then yellow rice, falafel and their white yogurt sauce. It was good. And the price is also reasonable for the generous portion"}
{"text":"All Greek places are Mediterranean, but not all Mediterranean places are Greek.  With that said, Parsley isn't exclusively Greek, which I wrongfully assumed. They had items on their menu I didn't typically associate with Mediterranean food -- nachos, curries, and baguette sandwiches. So there you go: your culturally infused bits of Mexico, Thailand, and France just in case you were experiencing a food conflict and didn't know where to go.  You will find that bowls and plates cost the same. What's the difference? Bowls have everything mixed in, while plates keep everything separate. You will also discover that no lamb or goat is served here, their main meats are either beef or chicken, which roast vertically on a turning spit. I believe they have tuna options for all the pescatarians in the house, and of course, falafel is indeed served here for all the veggie-heads.  I originally wanted to get the chicken shiskabob plate, but she said it would take about 10 minutes to cook and offered the chicken shawarma instead. I took it, but it was the wrong decision -- the sliced pieces of meat were cold and on the dry side. It was nearing the end of the day, so that may be why... but still, no excuse. I'd say wait and get the kabob! Tzatziki sauce, too.   My bf ordered the chicken curry served with rice. It reminded me of Thai yellow curry, but with an overpowering coconut flavor. Not really my style. I noticed that gyros aren't served here, but again, it's not a Greek place. Instead you'll find they have wraps and baguette options. Oh, try their cucumber chiller drink. It's light and refreshing.  PS -- Get the Groupon! Valid at two locations."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely healthy and delicious! Large portions, friendly staff and very clean too."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Prices are reasonable and the service was quick.  Outdoor seating is also a plus."}
{"text":"It was difficult to resist ordering my usual Steak Shawarma Wrap, but I took to the meatless route and tried their Falafel version during my last visit.  Parsley has never skimped on their ingredients. The wrap was jammed packed with crunchy falafel, a ton of veggies, tahini sauce, and chickpeas -- which I typically don't like eating in their original form, but I like eating them at Parsley. Portions are gigantic! Even with a large appetite (and I eat A LOT), I can only eat half of my wrap; the wraps will surely keep your appetite satiated for hours. It might be best to order your food to go even if you plan on dining at the restaurant, just so you have a container ready in case you can't finish all of your food in one sitting.   Even after several months of not visiting Parsley, the quantity and quality of the food is still fantastic. Such a shame Parsley is located on the other side of the world for me, but when hunger strikes it remains one of my favorite restaurants to consider eating at whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I rarely eat here because it is kinda pricy for what I enjoy, but it's so worth it on those days you're feeling down. There food is spiced properly and the portions are great. I've never had to say \"wow I wish they would have put more on my plate.\" I drown my beef and rice in the orange soup sauce (I don't know what it's called) but it's quite tasty."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try something new and parsley was a great surprise. He got a steak bowl and I got a kabob plate. You can get bowl, plates, or wraps in beef, chicken and vegetarian options. It was super delish and their little patio in front is cute.  Workers were friendly ,They have a homemade cucumber chiller drink that was refreshing. If you like Mediterranean I would recommend this cute place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh everything! I always get chicken plate and yellow curry! And their cucumber drink is good too!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it fell short. I mean don't get me wrong it was decent food but not a place I am able to rave about or even a place that I would try a second time. I had the chicken shawarma bowl. The chicken tasted pretty good but was overshadowed by way too much lettuce and my bowl was filled with a lot of the bitter pieces. Overall, not a bad place to go but I've definitely had better"}
{"text":"I love this place and find myself, along with my coworkers ordering from there at lease once a week!  Their Menu is well priced and I haven't ate anything from there I didn't like. (Even though it's hard for me to order anything other than the Nachos!)"}
{"text":"How is this place even real? I have no pics of my food because I inhaled it. I ordered the steak nachos with everything on them and they were BOMB.  Also ordered the chicken bowl. Really big portion size! They did half-and-half beef and chicken for me which I thought was cool. Both the spicy red and the green hot sauces were delicious. There was a big crowd but the people behind the counter were working hard to get people through the line. They were courteous and didn't make you feel rushed. We also got a small baklava dessert and it was super good. Overall, we would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Ingredients are always fresh, customer service is fast and friendly, the food is incredible. Love this place."}
{"text":"Oh, my god! First of all, I would like to thank Groupon for this introduction :) I called in my order ahead of time because I'm not the best at waiting. My order consisted of hummus, parsley fries and a falafel bowl with extra veggies, grape leaves, and red quinoa. The portions are huge and the food is even better. Trust me, you won't be disappointed and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here yesterday. I'm a big fan of mediterranean food since they usually have lots of vegetarian options. I got the humus, tzatziki and falafel platter. YUMMMMMY! Even though the salad had chickpeas in it, it was still really good. I know, I know, hummus has chickpeas, but they are pureed! I also had the side of carrots. WOOOOOW. They were SOOOOO good. Just a hint of heat, and so tasty.  The prices are fantastic. Not expensive at all! The service was GREAT. The girls were extremely friendly and helpful. This place has what I look for when dining out: good food, good service and decent prices. They definitely excelled when it came to all 3! I plan on coming back again. This place is not near me at all, but good food is always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! I enjoyed the chicken its cooked really well. It just a very small cramped place tho, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing customer service. They were so friendly and receptive to all my questions. They didn't make me feel bad about my allergies and they're very vegan/vegetarian friendly. I left a $5 tip which is something I've never done at a fast casual food place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh and tasty... not to mention friendly staff! Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best falafel bowls I've had in a while, the baklava is super yummy and if you get a chance try their cucumber chiller it's very refreshing and delicious not to mention healthy, this is coming from someone who's not a fan of cucumbers!"}
{"text":"The portions to cost ratio is great & it taste bomb too. Also, try their chiller! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago.  The place was empty, and my sister and I ordered two items.  I had the chicken shawarma, and she had the kabobs.  The kabobs took a bit longer, which was fine, and we both ended up getting salads. The best part was the salad. It felt like they prepared it there, so there was  pretty fresh.  The problem was that it was really bland. the Shawarma didnt help as it didn't have any flavors.  My sister didn't like her kabobs either. The texture of the chicken meat was so odd, as if every piece had cartilage.  It was also  quite disappointing.  I bought a groupon but i dont think ill even go back to use it."}
{"text":"Simple, quick, and healthy greek food.   It's set up like Chipotle in that you select the toppings/protein as you order. You can get a bowl, wrap, salad, or plate. It moves slower than the typical place that's set up like this but I think it's because you have more options. If there's a rush, you might have to wait awhile.   Everything I've tried here has been very good. I usually get the chicken plate with rice and salad. Best parts IMO are the tzatziki sauce and hot sauces. I also really like the falafel here because they are made to order - so they never taste stale or like they've been fried then sat around all day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. Staff is so nice. Food is great. So many yummy options.."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. You can customize each order with your choice of style such as plates, wraps, baguettes, bowls, or on a bed of salad; and your choice of toppings such as fresh parsley,carrots, olives, onions, tzatziki or tahini dressing. They also provide great options for vegans and vegetarians such as falafel, hummus, roasted eggplant, babaganosh, tabouli, and greek salad. We ordered BBQ Baguette - Steak with lightly toasted baguette, steak shawarma, BBQ sauce and mediterranean salad. And also Parsley Nachos - Chicken that has homemade pita chips, chicken shawarma, onions, tomatoes, tzatziki, feta cheese. Their cucumber drinks was really refreshing and healthy as well.  It's a small restaurant, pretty clean. You do have to ask for keys for the bathroom which I think they should change that. They have outside seating as well. The owner is nice and asked if everything was ok. We will be back."}
{"text":"The babagnaoush is fantastic, but everything else was just so-so. My husband on the other hand, REALLY liked it. I might have to give it another try just to be certain, but as it stands, meh, I can take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this place. Good food, pretty good portions. Like similar reviews the service here wasn't that great. First time I ordered a beef kabob bowl and a chicken kabob bowl it was okay, the beef kabob was ground beef balls, did not really like the taste, the chicken was better. This time I had ordered a beef shawarma and a chicken shawarma bowl to go. I had asked for the sauce to be on the side (since the first time I came here it was spicy) and instead they poured it right on top. Instead of asking for a new one decided to just settle for this, which I shouldn't have since the sauce they have is quite spicy, my girlfriend had to take most of what was covered in sauce off because of this, which was most of the meat. Probably better off going somewhere else that's similar in aspect like halal guys now that there's one in town."}
{"text":"Has some of the best customer service and the freshest chicken shawarma salad I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for Parsley a week ago and was excited to try it. Walked into an already crowded place, a god sign for sure. A coworker recommended I try the falafel and I'm glad I I'd. Normally a meat-a-holic a was hesitant, especially when you re staring at two spits full of meat. I had he falafel in the wrap. A spread of  humus and a healthy portion of greens and one veggies topped with the falafel and I chose the  tzatziki  sauce. Great flavors and a large wrap, couldn't finish it. A very friendly and informative staff!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, the service was very fast and friendly. Good fast healthy food; they even have homemade cucumber juice. I was really surprised that my boyfriend liked this place too he got the beef bowl with the tahini sesame seed sauce. I got a chicken wrap it was good but really big only ate half."}
{"text":"If my husband was reviewing, I predict that he would rate Parsley at 4 stars. He really enjoyed his Steak plate. I got the same exact entree but I felt that the steak was overdone and dry. The rice and salad are your standard Mediterranean fare. I really loved the homemade cucumber chiller. Their hummus and tzatziki sauce were delicious. We also ordered the Parsley fries with feta and parsley on top, and that was excellent.   Customer service was good; the young lady at the counter who helped us was friendly. When we were leaving an older lady came out from the back and said goodbye to us. It was a nice feeling.  All in all, I felt like there were hits and misses with the menu but there seems to be many options to choose from that can make or break your experience. For my husband, it's a winner. For me, not so much."}
{"text":"We're Lebanese and this place is great.  It's a build your own shawarma!  Little note though all of the curries are made with shawarma meat as well.  Comes as a roll/burrito, bowl, salad, you name it.  Note for shawarma experts:  shawarma both beef and chicken are on the spit all day, no shaving and re-grilling/re-heating, they don't shave it off until you order."}
{"text":"I'm middle eastern, the food is legit and convenient while the environment is rather pleasant."}
{"text":"The team was outstanding in presenting the food products. The head chef (Fernando, I believe), was highly passionate and professional. The food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in after getting a car wash up the street. Place is super clean, staff is friendly, & the food was good. We ordered two small chicken wraps with tzatziki. Loved it & the baklava was a sweet ending."}
{"text":"Fast, easy and delicious!  Highly recommend it for any meal.  They make everything in house and you can taste the freshness.  We split a falafel wrap, good portions and refreshing cucumber chili juice to wash it down."}
{"text":"Ate here a week ago and meant post then. Love the food concept, stand in a line and tell them what they should add to your plate. Had shwarma with rice and salad. Good food and reasonably priced. Be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent food, flavorful and filling, especially for a vegetarian. However menu description can be more clear about what is included and what constitutes as a paid side order. Regardless I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My first time at Parsley and it was really good . We had the chicken shawarma plate and the tuna on salad .   The chicken shawarma plate was great the chicken seasoned and well cooked . I had rice with it which was good and a side salad . Always get extra hot sauce it is amazing . The tuna salad was also very good and it is made without mayo which was the selling point . Everything here was really tasty . Service was quick .  The addon prices are well posted although we thought it was weird that there's no charge for sauces but more tomatoes were an extra charge . The salad only had a couple diced tomatos on it .   Overall I'm surprised I haven't been here yet but the place is really good and we will back !"}
{"text":"This place is pre-tty, pre-tty, pre-tty great! Ended up here on a weekday when my boyfriend and I didn't feel like cooking. He had snatched a Groupon weeks prior and I had been itching to try this place out. \"It's like a Mediterranean Chipotle\", he would say. SO WHAT THE HECK IS TAKING US SO LONG TO TRY IT?!, I would think.   Chicken Bowl, bruh. Deliciousness. Salad, rice, chicken shawarma and your choice of toppings. For him? Steak nachos. And by \"nachos\" they mean awesomely seasoned fried pita chips. By the end of our meal time I had wished I ordered his instead. We made both our orders \"combos\", one with a small order of the eggplant salad which was yummo and the other with parsley fries which were pretty addicting.   This is likely going to be my go-to I-really-don't-feel-like-cooking choice of fast food establishments. Best part? Guiltless! It helps that the guys behind the counter were informative and helpful. You could tell they want to make sure you walk away happy, which was...different. ;)"}
{"text":"A solid place to get a falafel salad on a Sunday for lunch. You can save half of it for dinner that night. I like replacing the tahini sauce topping with baba ganoush."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went here for lunch and the place was packed!  We just discovered this Mediterranean joint but everyone was already in on the secret!  Anyway, I opted for the vegetarian falafel and the staff was happy to obliged.  The portion was big, the cost wasn't so bad, and the food was definitely tasty.  Coming back for more of Parsley grubs very soon!"}
{"text":"Found this spot on Groupon.  $8 for $16 worth. You can get a combo for only $9.  It was delicious!  Customer service was great!  Girls were very knowledgeable about the food. I was given recommendations, took her advice and the steak plate was very good!  I will be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"This place was a hidden gem. Glad I ran across it. Owner is super friendly and the food was most delicious. I had the red quinoa salad and I added chicken kabob. It was super fresh and chicken was grilled in front of me and juicy and flavorful. Started with hummus which was also quite good. Very reasonably priced for fast, fresh, REAL food. Eat here. Tell your friends."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal especially if you r looking for healthy eats!  Their salads come in perfect containers and easy to take home if you don't finish.  Their chicken and steak are nice cuts of flavorful meat.  Lots of gluten free, vegan options too."}
{"text":"I think the food at Parsley is great, if overpriced. The customer service however, is another story. I purchased two Groupons for Parsley only for the staff to tell me they were already used, when they had not been. Groupon contacted the owners/managers but never heard back. Thankfully, Groupon has excellent customer service and refunded my payment. The whole experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I'm not in a hurry to go back, despite having been a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Very modern.  Self serve restaurant. Small but well decorated.  Reminds me of Manhattan city  small mom and pop pizza place but Mediterranean and modern. Owner is very active at restaurant.  He will walk around  and make sure each customer is happy at his restaurant. Nice gesture.  Food was surprisingly very good for what they charge.  Quality  of food was there and my chicken curry was only $ 7.49.   This is now my favorite Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg nom nom nom..... I need this in NYC.....nom nom nom nom.  Eat here, sell me the rights......nom nom nom"}
{"text":"It's okay. Falafel was kind of salty & meat was shaved pretty thin. Hummus and tzatziki was good. I would eat here again if friends wanted to, but probably not in my own."}
{"text":"The front ladies had a nasty attitude i told them if I can make my food into a combo and they laughed in my face like if I was trying to make a joke  And some other people came in that were from the Middle East and they were being really nice to them."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food even though they were about to close. A little pricey but food was excellent. Chicken shish kabab a must try."}
{"text":"This place is great. I travel to Vegas for work about 1x a month and have always wanted to try this place. I am so glad I did. I have gotten the hummus and dolmeh appetizers (both soooo good) and the gyro w/ fries. Their gyro meat was juicy (and had a nice crisp to the outside) and the fresh pita bread was so good. My one suggestion is that the olives they use are generic black olives (not kalamata olives) in their salad and hummus.   Prices are great too. I got the 3 items above for around $12. Super affordable.   I would 100% recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was amazing. I ordered a steak wrap on wheat with both hot sauces. Mmmm bomb!!! Big portions too."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Parsley Modern Mediterranean (I thought the name was Wild Parsley).  I met a friend and her 5 year old for lunch.  The first thing I noticed was how friendly the staff was, the next thing I noticed was the portion sizes, which were huge.  You order an entree and it comes with a salad with your choice of ingredients.  You want it in a wrap, they wrap it.  The rice was wonderful as was my beef shish kabab.  Right around $20 for the two of us to enjoy this meal - the little one shared Mom's plate. Since they serve baklava, why aren't they serving coffee or espresso?  I could sneak out to Parsley Modern for a mid morning snack if you guys don't tell my boss.  Oh wait, I am the boss, so no one will catch me doing that."}
{"text":"We swung through here last month, before heading home. We were able to score seating inside, which was nice as this place appears to be quite busy. As a quick disclaimer - I am NOT a big fan of \"Mediterranean\" / Greek (basic) foods. Having that in mind I thought my 'Steak Shawarma Plate' was A-OK. Nothing very special about it and it did not sway me to reconsider \"Mediterranean\" foods. I did not pick the place, I was just along for the ride.   I found the food to lean towards the bland side. Those with me enjoyed their meals more than I did; and would probably give this a 4 star rating. But, hey, it's my Yelp account! Would I eat here again? Sure. Would I choose to eat here again? Very doubtful. However, if this is the kind of food you enjoy - try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon on a whim, the reviews did not disappoint. I had a steak wrap, my mom had the chicken curry special. It's kind of like a Mediterranean chipotle, the food is fresh, made to order, delicious flavors. The only thing I wasn't super crazy about was the falafel, kinda bland but the freshly made hot sauce was delicious. Overall,'it's a must try if you love Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Saw this place online and figured I would check it out with my wife.  We got there n were unsure how it would be since it's fast food.  Carlos the counter guy was very helpful and friendly.  We ordered two beef kabob plates, w a side of eggplant caponata, baba ganoush, tabouli,and pita chips.  They had this awesome cucumber chiller my wife had.  Super good food and good flavors for a good price.  We were impressed and am a particular eater because I work for the last 20 yrs in the industry.  Anyhow the staff was super friendly and really nice something most places these days lack.  We definitely will return for another visit."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad hubby had the chicken wrap all delish and even the cucumber water is amazing and it doesn't hurt for the check in for the free baklava"}
{"text":"Ordered the schwarma chicken wrap. Everything tasted fine until I got to the end of my wrap and bit down on something hard and.. well, my closest guess is ceramic. I don't know if this was some freak accident in the kitchen but I was immediately disgusted. I removed the small, tooth-sized chunk from my mouth, washed it over water to examine it. Still couldn't figure out what it was but it had been in my wrap the whole time.  I couldn't finish the wrap after that. And it had been so delicious up to then! But how disgusting. I hope no one else has had this issue.   It was a very unpleasant experience for me and one that will prevent me from coming back here again. I can't even describe how nauseated I felt when this occurred.   Again, hope this doesn't happen to anyone. Probably just a bizarre event, but, it did happen and it shouldn't have. FYI."}
{"text":"First time here and was pleased with the service and food we recieved. The employees were friendly and helpful plus they were patient with us since we were not familar with the ordering process. We decided on the Chicken and Beef Shish Kabob plate and surprisingly they were both delicious and consistent. Meat was seasoned just right and the veggies were fresh. The cucumber chiller was recommended by the cashier and it was delicious and refreshing. Great place to grab lunch with friends or after a workout."}
{"text":"My Recomendation: Steak Shwarma.  I've always been a fan of Mediterranean food, but I haven't been too impressed by a lot of the places I've been to out here. Fortunately, Parsley is a trend breaker!  The selection on the menu was pretty small, which is fine. It's not overwelming. And they make up for their small menu size with their heaping portion sizes. If you're able to finish one of their shwarmas in one sitting, you should try out for one of those professional eating contests because you definitely have some talent.   The food itself was delicious! It kind of reminded me of a gyro, but better.The steak was nice and juicy, the vegetables seemed pretty fresh and they used just enough sauce and hummus. I've been to other mediterranean places where they drench it in so much sauce that my bread gets soggy before I get to finish my meal.  One complaint I have is how small the store is. There was no room to even stand in line without feeling like you're intruding someone's eating area. Maybe I just went on a busy day, but the place was packed. A bigger, more open store would fit them better.   Customer service was great. Everyone was so polite and had a big, friendly smile the whole time. Even though I was asking some pretty dumb questions (like, what's a shwarma? What goes on it?) the guy I talked to was happy to answer with sincerity. He didn't make it seem like they were dumb questions at all.  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"The idea of this place is very similar to Chipotle in the ordering process. You order a bowl/plate/baguette/wrap/etc and choice of meat and toppings you want included. I ordered the steak shawarma plate which includes the steak, rice, salad and pita bread, as well as plenty of delicious toppings I added on. I decided to make it a combo and ordered an appetizer (babaganoush). Overall, to sum it up: great food, great portions. Would recommend."}
{"text":"So I gotta preface this review by saying.. It's been years since I have had a shawarma. Sad, I know! But I was in the area for work and had an hour for lunch, so I found this spot on yelp and gave it a shot. Verdict? Definitely satisfied. I had the steak shawarma wrap (wheat). It was savory and hearty. There were so many flavors that just screamed Mediterranean, but not in an obnoxious, overpowering way. This place is a gem, but now I'm inspired to compare it to other places in town. Thanks Parsley for jumpstarting this quest hahaha"}
{"text":"So glad we bought this Groupon! The food & service were amazing!! I tried the Parsley Nachos, 1/2 steak & 1/2 chicken. The girls there let me try the different sauces I could put on it. They were both delicious so I put both on my nachos!  My friend had the steak plate & it was fantastic as well! We will definitely be back & soon!"}
{"text":"*** Two of the BEST MOUTHGASMS EVER!*** Just ate here for the first time so the hubby and I opted for a variety of things so we could taste as much as possible. There aren't enough adjectives to describe how AMAZING this place is!   They are beyond 5 stars and A+ for us! I may be back this weekend even though they are not close to anything for us. We just happened to need the extended hours post office up the street and decided to try it out.   Oh, and btw I am a connoisseur of Mediterranean food, lol. The point being that I definitely know the difference between EXCELLENT and mediocre.   We had a chicken shawarma plate with babaganoush and a steak plate with hummus. Both plates came piled as full as absolutely possible with food which included rice and salad.  I included two pics one showing the two plates about 5 minutes into eating (Duh, sorry) and one of the hubby's plate after he finished. I thought he might lick it clean before all was said and done. I, on the other hand, had enough left over to FILL a full sized to-go box. Seriously folks, BIG portions!  The service was quick and both of the people working were kind and helpful. I asked a lot of questions considering it was our first time there and the young lady who helped us was patient and descriptive with a great smile as an additional treat. She did not rush us or so much as hint to being annoyed by the many questions.  I couldn't help myself and had to order some baklava when I went up for the to-go box. Haven't tried it yet because we are too full. They have several varieties so of course I got an assortment.   We were DELIGHTED to see that they have a loyalty program, especially since this just became my favorite restaurant and new hangout.   DELICIOUS...WONDERFUL....SURPRISING... SCRUMPTIOUS... FANTASTIC... AWESOME...   You get the point, right? Go! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my husband and I love this place. We've dined in, carried out, and used delivery services many times. The food is always good.   Tonight was a major let down. We used a delivery service. When our order arrived, we immediately noticed both of our entrees were made incorrectly. Along with the incorrect entrees, they didn't give us the sauce we asked for. In addition, we were missing items we paid for. Serious disappointment. We're hoping this was just a one time issue, but if it happens again, you've lost us as customers."}
{"text":"Just hit tried out Parsley for a late lunch/early dinner and was not disappointed! Food was great and the service was super friendly. They let us taste samples of a couple of items so we could make the best choices and were patient as we made up out minds.   Only two things I'd like to point out as constructive criticisms...the music was too loud- we had to talk to the folks on the other side of the counter to navigate our way through our first time and between the music and kitchen equipment I felt like I was shouting. The other thing was the side of chips I ordered. I chose not to get the combo which could have included chips, because I didn't know what quite what to expect with the Hummus Shwarma Bowl I ordered but after I started eating realized I should have gotten the combo...I needed those chips :) I went to the counter and ordered them. There was some discussion behind the counter about how to ring them up and the verdict for a small side of chips was $3. No big deal but seemed a little steep to add a small portion that would have been less if I got the combo. I know they are still figuring out their groove- just something to note. Congratulations on your second location- keep it coming!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery that never came. Their staff was incredibly rude and just hung up on me. Was never called back for my delivery even though i called them mutiple times. The time it takes for them to prep food is incredibly slow. Overall horrible place wouldn't recommend anyone to go here"}
{"text":"This is kind of like chipotle for Mediterranean food but it's all made to order (except the curry and shawarma) so it's not too quick but not as slow as a sit down place.   They cook the kababs and falafels after you place your order. Once they are about to get ready you get to choose a bowl,wrap, or plate option. I got the bowl and they piled it up with rice and salad and other accoutrements at my request. Try the pickled carrots for a kick (spicy! And so good!!). $1 extra for hummus. The bowl comes with either tahini or  Tzatziki sauce but I got both. I love the tzatziki.   The appetiser falafel option comes with hummus and 6 falafels.   Check in on yelp for a baklava!   I was visiting from LA for work and I was in the area for two days and we went to this place two days in a row, it is that good.  This place does NOT serve alcohol. But the drink they have on the counter (usually a cucumber mint lemonade but not overly sweetened) is really refreshing!  There is very little seating inside and it can get chaotic when there are more than 4 people trying to grab food but they are trying really hard and the food is amazing. I hope they thrive."}
{"text":"For fast food this place is awesome. Been here a few times and the food is pretty good.The salads are good and so are the wraps. I rather eat here than any other fast food chain and it's healthier!!!!"}
{"text":"What a find! Great Mediterranean food and surprisingly fast. I ate the falafel plate and it was delicious. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Yum!  Portions are big and falafals freshly made order!  All fresh veggies and sides and really filling,  you can actually split one dish or make it into 2 meals.  Returning happy customer :)"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect- WOW - it was great! Vegetarian sampler platter was tasty and the chicken kabob plate rocked. Topped it off with some assorted baklava to wrap up an awesome meal! And don't forget to try the cucumber cooler too! Yum!"}
{"text":"Fresh fast healthy and yum tastic"}
{"text":"Food always taste good. The staff is a little hard to understand. Wasn't happy about the crumbs they gave us when we ordered pita chips :( there was about 5 large chips and then this..."}
{"text":"The name sounded interesting and enticing so, I decided to give it a go. I'm a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine, flavors and all. This, was about the worst I've had yet. The chicken and beef Shwarma plates included salad (your choice on veggies for the salad and VERY dry rice that seemed as if it sat out all day. You could get hummus, which is extra and olives (extra). The meats were appearing to look as if they were either leftover pieces sitting on the bottom of where they cut and slice the meats. Both, the beef and the chicken were ULTRA dry, piled in a cluster. The chicken had a weird smell to it and the pieces (literally small crumb-like pieces) were just not appetizing at all. Even with drowning it in sauces or dips, it had a weird flavor to it. Both, were utterly disappointing as I was excited to try this \"modern\" twist. I can't understand what made it so modern? Perhaps the fact that they don't do any kind of \"Gyros\" and serve choices on Baguette's instead? I ended up picking at the salad. The olives were extremely salty. The rice was too dry and the Baklava couldn't even save this meal. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this brand and was excited to see one open conveniently near my house. Popped in on a Saturday afternoon to test it for myself.  Absolutely loved this new place!! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with menu items and ingredients. Super accommodating for vegans and vegetarians.  Plenty of meat lover choices as well. Everything is made fresh daily and you can taste it. I ordered a falafel bowl and was pretty pumped when I saw the staff prep and fry them fresh in front of me. It was also a great size for the price. I ended up taking half to go. I recommend the spicy little carrots to nibble with your meal. The line flow was nice and easy. The overall cleanliness and chill ambiance makes this spot a 5 star for a hangry lady like myself. Wish they delivered bc now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"This place is excellent . Always a place to get fresh food and my husband really enjoys it also. The falafel is always fresh and it's very good"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the location on E. Sunset, but found myself going less and less and craving more and more! It was just too far of a drive to go for. This location is next to my workplace, so I will definitely be frequenting for lunch. Their portions are huge, flavor is great, and the price is fantastic.   This visit, I ordered a chicken bowl with tzatziki and pita on the side which was the bombdotcom. Like the other location, their food never fails. Step aside subway. If you want to \"eat fresh\" then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My husband had Steak salad and raved about it. I had steak nachos which was great. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Love the food here! So fresh and clean. I got there chicken salad before and the serving size is pretty generous. Also try there cucumber drink that they have near the soda machine for an extra healthy kick!"}
{"text":"Their shawarma meat is delicious. The baklava was delicious, too. All of the food was very good. It has to be for me to drive so far to get it! The only thing that was subpar was the tzatziki sauce. It was runny and the veggies in it were very limp. That's one of my favorite things, and the reason for the loss of one star."}
{"text":"We decided to come back here the 2nd time around because although the food was mediocre, their beef kabob wasn't really chunks of beef but rather more like a beef meatball, we got great customer service the first time. So, I wanted to try their chicken kabob plate and come back for their cucumber chiller which was pretty good.  But as we walked in, the male hispanic employee behind the counter did not even smile nor greet us. He asked what we would like in a cold and bored tone of voice. I told him I wanted the chicken kabob plate and a regular beef wrap.  As he started to prepare our wrap, he asked if it was for here or to go. When I said it was for to go, he rolled his eyes as if it was an extra effort to get a to go box which was just placed underneath the counter. But I ignored his arrogance and continued to pick the sides I wanted with my order.  Then I saw him plating my chicken \"kabob\" order and instead of it being a kabob, he put in the shredded chicken that is used on wraps. So, of course I reiterated my order. He then picked off the shredded chicken off with his bare hands and said, \"it will be another 15 minutes if you get the chicken kabob\". At this point, i was so disgusted with this guy's attitude and told him to cancel that order and I would just pay for the steak wrap. Rather than apologizing for not getting my order right, he then proceeded to shake his head and told me it was messed up as they have already prepared the order.   To make the long story short, I walked out of there with my steak wrap and told him I did not care whether it took hours to prepare my other order because I will not pay for it after the rude gesture and unsanitary circumstances that he just displayed.  It is a shame that in spite of how good your food may be, or how nice your restaurant is, one bad employee can drive away customers. So, to the owner of this restaurant, you might want to send this employee for further training on how to deliver good customer service and sanitation. He brings negative vibe to your business and clearly shows he does not like his job! You don't want to be the next restaurant to be featured on Dirty Dining"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night for a quick bite to eat prior to watching a movie. We'd pass by this place many times on our way to the gym, so I was excited to try it! When we first walked in, I noticed how clean the place was. The bathroom was nice and the toilet paper was thick and soft, which is surprising for a fast food type place. Furthermore, the service was good except the guy who was handling our order was in a rush and made our order wrong... But it's okay. The dinner rush can be rough when there's a lot of people coming by for dinner!   FOOD: Imagine a Chipotle style food bar where you tell the associate what you'd like. I had the falafal bowl and my husband has the steak bowl. The food was okay. The falafal was cripsy. I added the hummus in my bowl, which was tasty. BEWARE - the green mild sauce is pretty spicy! The red hot sauce just taste hot and lacks flavor. The steak lacked taste. I believe there are better Mediterranean places around town to try with better food and service.  If you check-in, you get a free dessert. They baklava was small. We got the almond one, which was okay.   PRICE: For our two bowls and the free dessert it was around $20, which is fair. The portions was pretty big and I had to take half of it home so it was great value.   Overall, I give it a 3-star since everything was okay. I probably would not come back though.   Happy Dining,   JT"}
{"text":"This place is great! Ordered for pick and was ready once I got there. Cheap daily special. Why go get a burger when u can eat here."}
{"text":"This place is awsome, so friendly, the food is amazing. They gave us free chips and dip and a drink each while waiting for our order. Prices are amazing for the portions. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. First, the 2 ladies behind the counter were very rude. The menu didn't include a description of any of the items and they seemed annoyed when I asked what came in 2 of them. I ordered a chicken salad, my husband had the chicken bowl and my kids shared a plate. I had to ask for them to put tomatoes and cucumber in my salad, I guess it comes with just lettuce and chicken? My kids love olives and to get a couple on the chicken plate it costs extra. My husband ordered the bowl and it's strange, there's no rice or anything, just chicken and hummus and chick pea. He decided to buy a side of pita chips but they were stale and disgusting. He immediately took them back. No apology was given, the lady actually looked pissed that he said anything. She gave him fries instead but was really weird about it. None of the food had much flavor and the pita bread was really chewy. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the good reviews are from friends or family of the owners because there was absolutely nothing \"4 star\" about this place. I would definitely not return. The Great Greek and even Stephano's are a million times better, the staff are polite and the food actually has flavor."}
{"text":"Such wonderful staff!  I don't eat Mediterranean food often but my friends are vegetarian and recommended this as a place we could all eat at.  They were right; there was great variety and something for everybody.  The staff is very sensitive to dietary restrictions and were happy to accommodate the person in our party with a gluten allergy.  When I ordered, I naturally had a lot of questions being not so familiar with this type of cuisine, but the girls behind the counter were knowledgeable and patient when answering me (and just so sweet).  The food was phenomenal!  It was so fresh and they were very generous with their portions.  I was curious and tried their housemade cucumber drink and I highly recommend it!  Very refreshing, and only a little strange for someone unaccustomed to it.  I'm only sad I don't live in the area or I would definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for dinner here.  I had the nachos and  she had a beef with rice plate (sorry I don't remember what to call it).  The food was good and fast.  The service was helpful and friendly.  The price was around $9 each with a drink and fries so I thought that was good.  We had left over food so we brought it home and our teenage son chomped it all down so he liked it also.  Though I have had better mediterranean food at restaurants this place is 5 stars for a quick lunch or dinner!  I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go here almost everyday for lunch and the people here are beyond amazing and always SO friendly. Yvonne is my favorite, she knows me by name and she always knows exactly what I want. :) My company is right down the street and we cater from here all the time! Parsley's is always on time, and is able to accommodate us even if it is last minute! The food is absolutely delicious, I have ordered from here numerous times I have NEVER been disappointed. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"}
{"text":"Always love going into Parsley. I only work across the street and go here at least twice a week to have a salad or a wrap and I am always extremely happy with the service I receive and the food I eat. The staff is extremely nice and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I like how the food here is prepared fresh right before your eyes.  1 star = for their chicken shawarma salad.  I was actually surprised with the outburst of flavor in their chicken.  It made me very happy.  2 stars= for their even more flavorful steak.  I've had their steak shwarma salad and I was even more content with the outcome than I was with chicken.  But chicken is probably the best for your body!  3 stars = parsley.  Lots of parsley.  I never thought to add this stuff to my salad, but what a great combination they have made with their salad.  Lots of cucumber cubes too!  Their salads here are really fresh, and they hav 2 types of dressings to choose from.  Both are really tasty.  4 stars = check your Groupon NOW deals.  They are always on there offering great deals!  This place is great for a quick and healthy lunch.  Their helpings are fairly large so you will definitely be fulfilled!  If you're into Baklava, they have Chocolate Baklava.  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (63/365)."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't know what to expect a little off the Vegas strip but the food was great. We had gotten there right when they put out fresh salad and veggies. They made the chicken as we ordered. I do wish there were pictures or descriptions of what each option came with. I ordered the humus shawarma with chicken and it came with Humus and chicken and you got to choose the veggies and sauce. My friend ordered the chicken bowl and his came with rice and salad  he got to choose  veggies and a sauce too. I would definitely go again. They have a patio and inside seating."}
{"text":"Great Fresh Food!  First time trying this place and I wasnt too sure what to expect. The inside is small but clean and modern.  They have the meat up on rotisserie spinners and they carve it off fresh to order. You basically pick from a bowl or wrap. I picked the bowl with both steak and chicken. Large portion with lettuce, garbanzo beans, cabbage and rice. The meat has great flavor and moist all the way through. You can also add a variety of dressings, spiced compotes, cheese, and veggies. I had the green and red compotes and both were pretty spicy but really good. The tzatki cream cucumber dressing was a great compliment to the bowl. I also had pita and hummus and it was great! Pita was fresh, hot, and soft. The cucumber beverage was a nice refreshing drink not too sweet.  I will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"I've gone to parsley twice and I love their falafels. They taste house made and are served with hummus. For $3.50 it's just super yum.  I had their curry last time which was tasty but almost bland. It may have been because I got the last serving but hey it was served to me so that's what I'm judging. I'm a sucker for curries too.  I also had a chicken kabob plate. This was okay. It was kind if bland. Served with a pita, rice, and a salad. This was $8 I believe.  Most recently I got their chicken scwharma over hummus. This was advertised as a special which was lame because I assumed it would be a meal. It was a tin filled with hummus with chicken sliced into it with chickpeas. It had sauce over it and served with a thin very large pita type bread. This was good but more of a shared appetizer. Couldn't eat a large serving of this. The chicken was good with a nice smokey grilled taste to it. This was $8 I believe.  Overall I think the place is affordable for something unique and fresh. Their food is consistent. The place is clean.   I would definitely return for their falafel but I am still on the look out for a good casual Mediterranean place with good falafel."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've been Not clean floor we're not swept all day The bread was hard Falafel has no flavor It seemed like the food was old and the meat was recooked and placed on my plate There's other Mediterranean food around that location that are way way better Sad place to eat in"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while craving fresh Mediterranean food. Best decision I had made that day. Guys at the counter were friendly and helpful. Food looked delicious right from the start.   It's fast casual, Chipotle line style. Pick your style (bowl, salad, plate...). Protein options were plentiful and falafel was available made to order. Plenty of veggies and sauces to top off.   Ended up getting a plate with beef shwarma. It had lettuce, rice, shwarma, with all the veggies and toppings you could want. Was able to make it a combo for 3.99 extra. Well worth the pita and hummus, as well as beverage. The cucumber drink was fresh and flavorful. Will definitely be frequenting this place as my go to Mediterranean spot."}
{"text":"Very nice meal.  Service was a little slow for lunch because of the line, but the food was really tasty.  We tried a steak bowl and a tuna wrap.  The portions are generous and the prices are pretty good especially if you have a restaurant.com coupon.   The cucumber drink is pretty good.  A little sweet, but not very.  I complements the meal very nicely.  There are plenty of choices.  Atmosphere was a little louder than average and there are not enough tables."}
{"text":"Parsley Modern Mediterranean isn't the most authentic food in town.. but it is quite tasty.   As other reviewers have stated, this ordering set-up here is similar to a place like Chipotle: you pick the style of dish you want (skewers, wraps, bowls and so on) and then select toppings and extras, and then pay. Parsley is clean, casual, and staffed with super friendly employees. Service has always been exceeded my expectations for a laid back spot like this.   I saw my friend Jamie P. had written about the steak bowl in her review so I decided to try it out. It was so good, definitely my favorite item to order. The pita bread here is not my favorite,  and on my last visit the hummus was on the watery side, which is never a good sign.   Aside from the hummus situation, I have had nothing but great experiences at Parsley. Definitely a recommended spot for a quick, Mediterranean-esque meal.  TIP: Groupon has a deal for Parsley currently!"}
{"text":"Sooooo goooodddd !!!!!!!!! Soooooooo wooorrrtttthhhh it!!!!!!!!! I love everything , clean toooooo"}
{"text":"What a feast! We had the veggie sampler with extra grape leaves. Enough for 2 people! The hummus is amazing and the grape leaves are fantastic. The pita is warm and soft and perfect! The cucumber water is very refreshing. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I could eat here everyday! Great tasting food and fresh. They have steak and chicken on a rotisserie, love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, the  chicken curry on bed of yellow rice with side Mediterranean salad,  Also hummus were the best. Good service,  I would recommend  at least trying this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mediterranean food.  We got the chicken wrap, a plate and nachos.  All 3 were good!  The place is also very clean."}
{"text":"The best place hands down. I have never had Mediterranean food and I am glad I went to Parsleys for my first time. Does not even compare to Chipotle. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I go to VEGAS!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday and they were doing a food photo shoot. It's always interesting to watch photo shoots whether it be people or food.  Anyway, I had the chicken shawarma salad which is a bed of greens with a pile of chicken shawarma. I was surprised by the ample amount of meat.  The chicken and beef shawarma were both on a rotisserie and always carved to order. They also give you samples if you are undecided... That's actually how I choose the chicken instead of beef.   I like it here and will be back to try the rest of the menu and the baklava, which I totally forgot to try!"}
{"text":"I did a delivery, the food arrived cold and not tasty at all. I'll never eat from that place"}
{"text":"Time for an update.  I've found over the many times that I've been here since last review that, while they do offer pretty good food with some vaguely healthy ingredients, they don't have that something special to warrant my previous five star rating.  - The beef tagine hasn't lived up to the first time that I had it. - While the falafel balls are still good, especially if you have it in a wrap and get a salad that (ironically) doesn't include chickpeas, I have definitely had better places. - The meat options that I've tried are pretty decent but not great. Steak shawarma was a letdown. Beef kebab was pretty good but isn't really worth a ten minute additional wait (cook time).  I would call them somewhat of an Americanized take on the cuisine since they don't really have all the spices (or sweet/spicy sauces) that you find at great falafel / shawarma places. My friend actually had a beef BBQ baguette today, and I'm pretty sure the BBQ-esque flavor that I sampled doesn't belong in any sort of authentic restaurant of this sort. Still, with the prevalence of their salad mix and spicy carrots, they're a decent casual place for food that doesn't feel wholly unhealthy.  One more thing: you should know that they've been raising their prices and that they seem to do some strange things with entering Groupons at the register. Regarding prices, I'm pretty sure salads and large wraps were $8.49, baguettes were $7.49, and regular wraps were $6.49 today. Regarding Groupon, I'm guessing that the value is applied after tax or something, but others and I have found ourselves to be paying unusual (albeit small) amounts of cash when we didn't expect to owe anything."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food and they have that vegan option available for you ;) so you know that gives extra stars. They have this cucumber refresher water that I had to literally ask them if they could sell it by the gallon but I actually had to send my friend to do it hahahah and they said no but boy the drink alone is what gave the 5 stars hahah well that and when I went and ate there once, the owner was cleaning and came over and asked how everything was and seemed genuine. I loved that. Nice spot. & yummy :)"}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonably priced and friendly staff. We all enjoyed our lunch (mix Shawarma plates."}
{"text":"Happened on this spot by accident and I have been craving Falafel so I walked in to see if they had any on their menu.  Woo hoo falafel on the menu!!  I asked what else the woman suggested we try and she had a Beef Tagine on special.  Did not expect to her tagine from a small place like this, so I decided to order their special, which included an appetizer of my choosing, YES I chose the falafel.  Hubby and I were have a short break and needed a bite to eat, but not an entire meal.  This was perfect for us to share.  The beef was served over perfectly cooked rice.  There was a lot of flavor in the beef tagine and it was tender.  My one objection to this dish was that it was overly salted.  I have been avoiding adding salt to my food, so maybe I like things less salty, but even Hubby said he found it too salty, so I will go with it was overly salted.  The falafel on the other hand is some of THE best I have ever had.  It did not taste like the pre-made mix that so many other places use.  It really tasted freshly made, and if they are using a mix they are definitely adding fresh ingredients to it.  It was actually moist on the inside.  Crunchy on the outside and fresh and moist inside, they were delicious.  Their tahini dip was excellent too, not overly sesame flavored and a perfect balance to the falafel.  I'll be honest, the falafel was so good we are going back there today for lunch.  I'm thinking a falafel wrap is in order."}
{"text":"Very good food!!!...but I have one complaint. When I was building my wrap they told me most toppings were an extra charge. They have no clear cut menu stating what's an extra charge. Simple signage can fix that! Delicious meal tho"}
{"text":"Parsely let me count the ways... One of my all time lunch favorites this places is literally out the back door of my salon.  One of us from work eats here daily sometime up to 8 of us.   Such a healthy option to the burger and fries.  I absolutely love the Shwarma the way it slow roasts on the spit.  Mmmmm so good.  I don't eat a whole lot of red meat but the Steak and the Chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.  I usually get a Steak and Chicken Shwarma.  The tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off I like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.  BTW the Shwarmas are so big I usually get two meals out of it.  So the Shwarma is a treat for me I usually opt for Salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up, the dressing here is REALY good.  I've also had the Tagine a slow cooked stew, basically the meat falls apart in your mouth it's so tender.  The Falafel here ranks in the top 3 that I have ever had.  You can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.  The seasoning here on everything is perfect, the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.  This is a local guy living his dream, which I will continue to support the little guy in a big buiness world.  By the way they also have a punch card where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.  As I said Parsely let me count the ways Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"The service was slow and we couldn't understand the employees. The food is extremely spicy. We were never told if anything was spicy or if a sauce was spicy before it was added to our chicken kabob bowl. I'm very disappointed since it's so spicy we can't eat it. The grape leaves were good is all I can say...."}
{"text":"I eat here way more than I'd like to admit. Food is always great. Service is also. Thank you for   providing such a healthy place to grab a good lunch!"}
{"text":"The best healthy and delicious Mediterranean place ever to eat. This is my best and only Mediterranean food that I always eat from. I craves for it everyday and i make sure I go at least 3 times a month. the food is always fresh with good portion and always delicious. it's worth what you pay for! Fast services. If you like Mediterranean food, you should definitely try here. The prices aren't pricey as other places too."}
{"text":"I like this place for Mediterranean food among all the other places I have been to. I highly recommend the chicken shawarma on a baguette! I am a beef fan but for some reason I find chicken shawarma is better than beef shawarma! If you are a curry fan, try their rice with chicken curry! It is similar to Tai chicken curry and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Service is ridiculous, the ladies behind the counter were rude and seemed annoyed to have to perform their duties.  My friend asked for the green salad without dressing, the employee grabbed the oiled lettuce. My friend says again that she's like the non-oily salad. The woman acted offended and put out. Then I stood and watched her dump part of the food that my friend didn't want back into the buffet style bar, huffing and puffing with anger. My friend asks for cucumbers on her salad, the lady ignores her and slides the plate to the next employee, then my friend again says to her she's like cucumbers. I thought the employee was going to flip out. She threw some cucumbers on top of her salad. The food was overly salted in my opinion, nothing special at all.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Parsley recently especially their chicken curry.  This review is not based on their food but their service (or lack of)    It's Monday around 2:30pm, the line is not super long, there's three people out front (2 servers, one male and one female)  I was behind one guy that wants to sample the chicken curry, the female server is helping him.  The male server was helping someone in front of him at the time.  There's a lady waiting behind me.  When the male server was done, I don't know how this happened but it did, he skipped over me and went to ask the lady behind me \"how can I help you?\"   I was in shock, and didn't say anything at the time because I can't believe what just happened.  Did this guy really skipped over me?  Sure the lady behind me is beautiful, does it mean they serve beautiful people first here?  I waited and see if he would notice his mistake, I'm standing right next to the lady.  Sure enough, nothing from him.  When the female server is done, she clearly sees me waiting  and ask what can she get for me.  At this point, I asked the male server \"Did you just skipped me?\"  Then he finally goes \"Oh sorry, I didn't see you there\"  Seriously, how in the world you didn't see me?  I was so steamed up at that point I rushed out the door.    I don't think I'll ever coming back to this place, it's a shame they do have a good chicken curry."}
{"text":"The way this place is set up reminds me of Chipotle or Subway. Came here on a Thursday afternoon, and this place was packed. It's limited seating inside, but there's also seats outside as well.   Customer service here is a 5/5. Every person who works here who we encountered had a bright, cheerful, positive vibe. So that's a plus!   For the food I got the Chicken Salad. It was delicious! Upgraded my dish for a side dish and drink. Got the Parsley Fries, which were yum! And after seeing reviews about this cucumber drink, you know I had to try! It was very refreshing. Added some Sprite to it to give it a little fizz though. Lol.  Will most definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My First time here I tried the chicken shwarma wrap. Not only was it delicious, it was well priced and huge. What a deal! Since then I have tried most things on the menu and to my surprise I have not been disappointed yet. Try the fresh salads and make sure you try all the dressings and sauces with your meal :)"}
{"text":"It was good once I ate it but after I got a food poisoning from their olives I know it was the olives for sure.I couldn't recover 3 days after with severe stomach pain.  I think its a good place but they need to check for expired products...."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight, about 5:30pm.  Not crowded at all.  I ordered a falafel appetizer, hummus, large chicken wrap and steak nachos.  Falafel was excellent, served with some hummus.  Chicken schwarma wrap was very delicious and the hot sauce they serve on it reminds me of the sauce I used to get from the Israeli places in NY.  The steak nachos were nice, except the meat was dried out to literally to a crisp.  As I did not yet taste the meat, my husband was the one who commented on it to me.  I then took my bowl up to the girl and she added less dried out steak, because what I first got was the outer layer and then the less dried out meat was then put in the bowl.  That I found to be very accommodating.  Like another reviewer stated, later in the day the meats on the spits tend to get dried out.  Overall, the food was very good and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!   I could eat the Beef Shwarma wraps every day.  People are great, warm atmosphere, good was simply amazing."}
{"text":"I better not, food taste, ok serve not great by l women, made felt I shouldn't came. The body and face expression for asking question. The nice guy, tried to up, and another customer tried, but she took over. Until I got to cash register, I ask nice guy is she mad at me for asking question he shake his head, As to me saying he sorry, I ask what about my chips you said i can try, he was even scare to ask her, when he did she look upset at him and give one one chip, to say take that and move on, which I did, not plan on coming back, she to learn how to accept everyone, or leave altitude at the door before coming to work, are will a problem no matter how good food is. Customers are first supposed to be. Thanks for ask me to help you understand."}
{"text":"I bought the chicken kebab plate, and they took out one skewer and put it on the grill, and told me it would take like 12 minutes.  So I was thinking, 1)  12 minutes?  Bleh - I guess that's better than having chicken just out under a heat lamp or something, and 2)  Just one skewer is a plate?  What a ripoff!  But when I got my food, I realized that I was way off on 2).  The skewer was much bigger than I thought it was, and there were like, 5 or 6 golf ball sized chicken pieces on there.  That, plus the rice and the salad was more than enough for me, and I usually eat a lot for lunch.  The gf ordered the falafel bowl, since she didn't think she was hungry enough for a plate.  Well I dunno if the bowl is supposed to be smaller than the plate, but man, that was a ton of food too.  I think they gave her like 5 or 6 falafels along with salad and I think rice was in there too.  Definitely a lot of food, but it tasted great.  Not the best ever, but definitely above average.  It's right down the street from The Orleans casino, and since we stay there on occasion, we'll definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"Best Hummus in town... absolutely love their pita chips and wraps ... they have something for everyone  great urban spin on Mediterranean Food!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the great food and fast friendly service. 5 * . I enjoy the appetizers and falafel wraps and plates."}
{"text":"Place has very good fresh food with great price. I always get the chicken kebab plate (highly recommend!) The portion is big . Only down side is chicken is cooked to order so it takes about 15 mins but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Been craving beef kabobs for a while so I decided to give this place a try. They were out of beef kabobs when I got there so I got a steak shawarma plate instead. Good stuff with generous portions. They also offer 3 types of hot sauce (mild, hot and...fire, I think?). Got the hot to test the waters and wish I got fire instead. Maybe my tongue is just used to really spicy food. I don't know. The hot sauce had a good flavor to it, though!   As for customer service, it was Nicole who prepared my food and she is such a sweetheart! Gave out a coupon at the cashier, so I'm coming back soon. Hopefully they have the kabobs next time."}
{"text":"Food is ok, overpriced. Poor customer service, I've been here twice and it's Tammy the one that impresses me with her annoying facial expressions when you are ordering food. Today she was so busy taking a long order from a couple before me, after 5 min standing there finally I thought it was my turn to order and she skipped me. She took the order from the couple behind me and then realized I was there. I wanted a chicken kebab and they said it was gonna take more than 10 min. I stepped out. Istanbul Mediterranean by Ballys is way busier and their employees never have an annoying attitude like the ones here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. If you enjoy top quality Mediterranean food at affordable prices, this is your spot. I'm going to Parsley a few times per week and was never disappointed! 5 STARS."}
{"text":"Living in middle east for a portion of my life, it's nice to eat food that brings back so many good memories. The food was good, the establishment was modern and clean. I think the owner was there because he asked us how the food was and of there were any problems to let him know.   I will definitely come back when I'm on that side of town!  Oh, and the cucumber chiller was good!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from two friends, who said the vegetarian options were grande & after seeing all the glowing yelp reviews, I knew I had to try it.  Great service!!  Everyone was very nice and accommodating. I ordered the veggie skewer and honestly, I didn't care for the flavor one bit, it was gross.  But the salad & rice was delish!!  And my mom sampled the meat on the spit and she said it was to die for.  Next time I go, I'll definitely get something else, but overall we enjoyed our experience.    Get the groupon & the meat on the spit!!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because they have great food AND great service! I ordered take out for lunch, for the first time, yesterday through the yelp app.  When I arrived at the restaurant, they had not received my order for some reason.  They stated it was the second order that had not gone through for the day and apologized.  I told them I was on my lunch break and would not have time to wait for my order to be prepared, so they offered to make it and deliver it to me!  Less than an hour later, my food arrived at work with an added bonus (dessert) for the trouble.  The guy even apologized again.  That is excellent customer service!  Something went wrong and they went above and beyond to make it right. I ordered the Chicken Shishkabob Plate, which came with their yellow rice and a pretty large side of salad.  The chicken was moist and had excellent flavor.  The rice was also very good.  The tzatziki dressing for my salad was great too.  I also got a side of hummus for $3.99 and some grape leaves for an added $1.00 The hummus was delicious and the grape leaves were awesome!  I only wish I would've gotten more than 2 pieces of pita bread, so I could've eaten all of my hummus. The bonus desserts were a small triangle of baklava that was sweet w/ the perfect amount of syrup and crunch from the filo, and what I believe is a kourabiedes w/ some sort of chewy/nutty center (I had never seen this before, I even had to google it) which was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely have both of those the next time I come! My only issue was that I ordered a Diet Coke and the guy brought me a regular Coke."}
{"text":"I must've not gotten the right dish. Got the Chicken bowl. The was barely any flavor to it. But the serving is definitely more than enough! I might come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Great place great food fresh and put out strangely it's all good  schwarma was yummy and right off the skillet or whatever they call that grill and a plus for salad coverage"}
{"text":"Great customer service, generous portions. The bowl I got was quite large and lasted me another meal. It is a bit heavy on the rice. I was able to use a groupon but it is the type of place I would not mind coming back to because of the service I received and the cleanliness of the establishment."}
{"text":"As of my first visit.  Ima come back as an enthusiastic regular.  I'm going and commit coming here.  This is aptly priced Mediterranean food at the convenience of that fast casual Chipotle style of dining.  I'm very glad they offer free baklava for checkins.  The portions are generous and delicious man.  You gotta come down.  I'll fix this review by the time I've tried everything."}
{"text":"Mediterranean style Chipotle. Wraps, bowls, fries, etc.  I got the beef bowl with all of the toppings. Of course go for the Tzatziki sauce. I would get this again! We also ordered the shawarma hummus bowl. We were a little confused and didn't expect what we got. The bowl is literally just hummus with meat on top (lamb or beef) and a couple of pieces of pita bread. Order an extra order of pita! You will have SO much leftover hummus if you don't :)  There's a groupon that will even cut your order cost in half!"}
{"text":"I'll admit the only reason I came here was because 1. I had a Groupon for them (Quick, buy the Groupon before you come in!)  2. My yoga studio offered 10% off all orders (Whooo Modo Yoga!) AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.  The menu at Parsley is simple- bowl, plate or salad then choose your meat. They also have an appetizer and specialty menu- the curry and nachos are good! Always choose steak, always choose Tzatziki.  My only complaint is that when we ordered chicken curry they offered us half chicken and half  steak so that we could \"try both curries.\" We expected the two curries to be put on opposite sides, but instead they put the curries on top of eachother....... like, directly on top of eachother. So if you do get ask for half and half, make sure you specify that you want them separated haha. I'm still confused.  The curries are spicy, ask for a sample before you commit! The steak bowl is like a Chipotle bowl, but with Tzatziki instead of salsa and yellow rice instead of white. Same concept of ordering."}
{"text":"Fast service, a great place to start if you've never had Mediterranean style food. It can be very loud and busy so make sure to speak up when ordering!"}
{"text":"Here, we tried the falafel, chicken curry over rice, and chicken wrap with everything. My oh my, everything was amazing! They put together everything in front of you and it all taste so fresh! There was only one older lady working for a moment and she was hustling and persistent! She was slicing the meat, putting the food together, cashiering, and in to help us, then the lady behind us (who wasn't so polite, & we all know handling impolite people takes patience and time). Amazing! I always enjoy watching hard workers. Not to mention the food was great.  The only reason I give this 4/5 stars is I saw another person \"working\" but she didn't seem to be of much help nor did her customer service seem to be up to par. She was kind of forgetful. She had to ask my wife a few times if she wanted wheat or white bread for her wrap, but thank goodness the First Lady I mentioned made up for it all. Do try this place!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place, and it was pretty good! I had a salad bowl with mixed meats, chicken and beef both very flavorful, cucumber and tomato veggies, rice, pita bread and a side of tzatziki sauce. It was yummy and healthy, I ate it all!! Their cucumber drink was very good, not too sweet so it was perfect. Plus you get a free dessert when you check in with yelp. :)"}
{"text":"We are visiting from New Jersey and wanted something \"healthy\" and relaxing. As a frequent  traveler I'm always interested in authentic flavors. This place has the authentic \"mediterranean\" flavors.  Take Out and eat in. Approx 40 people inside and they have tables outside.  Staff is pleasant (we ate here a few times)... Shout out to Tammy"}
{"text":"Easy choice after the gym. So easy, it's hard to limit myself so as to not get tired of it.   Monkey do:  CHICKEN WRAP- chicken shaved off the spit, salad, hummus, tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley and a bit of tahini wrapped in whole wheat tortilla.   Get it as Salad, over chips, with beef, falafel...  This Monkey kind of fast food. Cucumber chiller is irresistible. Staff is friendly, helpful and fast."}
{"text":"Food very dry service awful it took them 20 minutes to make meals and the food is pre made and Zero flavor  Just awful  experience"}
{"text":"I was craving for something relatively healthy and I found this place. The food is okay. They are fast at making orders and they are cheap."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try and not disappointed. Keep coming back to try all the offerings. Im a fan."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan - sounds about right :) If you are a shawarma fan, this is a great place to check out. I had a great lunch here. Ordered a mixed shawarma meat salad that was really good. They offer steak and chicken shawarma, both were delicious but I think the chicken was a bit more flavorful. There are various salad mix-ins available like tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, chickpeas... I had my salad with tsaziki sauce as dressing, and warm pita bread. I also tried a bit of cabbage salad and eggplant salad. Neither disappointed. The cucumber cooler was pretty good as well. Not too sweet and refreshing. A Yelp check in gets you a free dessert and even when trying to be skinny, I can never say no to dessert... I opted for a chocolate drizzled baklava that was fresh and tasty.  Well rounded, almost guilt free meal. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had an awkward experience here. Bought a groupon to try this place out because I don't eat a lot of this type of food. When I came in and ordered the older lady kept asking me what I want. She kept repeating asking over and over again if I wanted to add more items or anything else. I kept saying no I just want to order these two items and I had to explain to her it was my first time here. So food took a while since they had to cook the kabob. When I went to go check out she literally asked me if I wanted to add a drink like 4 times and my answer was still no because I already had a drink. Then she told me my total was $15.16 and I gave her my Groupon which is worth $16. She scan the Groupon and then she goes you owe me $1.36 more after tax. And I go I'm confused you told me the grand total was $15.16 and now after I show you the Groupon you want to add more tax? I think she was upset that I used a Groupon but the ladies before me used groupons too. So I gave her my debit card to charge the $1.36 (tax according to her) and she goes you don't have cash? And I'm like no and then she hands me back my debit card without charging me the $1.36  and just walks completely away from me. So I took my to go food and went home. I wasn't a huge fan of the food either. The salad was lacking dressing and seasoning. The kabob was ok. I would not be coming back or trying it again."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it was delicious and everyone was nice.  Last night we came in for dinner the guy and girl at the counter were less than friendly.  We ordered steak shawarma and the guy asked me 6 more times if I wanted chicken or steak and by ask me I mean he yelled at me and my son.  At one point the older gentleman that was cleaning the counter answered for me and told him that I said steak.  The food took a very long time and I'm assuming that it was due to us using a Groupon.  The girl that rang us up was less than happy to take the Groupon and actually told us we couldn't use the Groupon for or combo meals and that she would have to ring our 5 orders up separately from the fries and drinks.  So we asked her kindly to please do so and even gave her a tip.  Afterward we could here the two employees speaking in Spanish to each other deciding what to do with the older gentleman  until they eventually told him to stay in the back and out of the front.  He was really nice by the way.  Then I could hear the two of them clamoring on about customers and just being overall unkind about their patrons.  I guess they figured a group of white people obviously can't understand Spanish, guess again!"}
{"text":"After much debate of returning... + the manager emailing me regarding my experience at Parsley Modern Mediterranean.  I returned to Parsley Modern Mediterranean and enjoyed a healthy and amazing Chicken Salad. I'll be coming back and enjoying healthy food after my gym workouts!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with fresh singular meats served on salad or wrap with a multitude if spices and topping to sprinkle on.   The chix curry has a mild coconut base over yellow rice. Got onions and peppers, too. They provide a red pepper sauce on the side to spice things up.   The cucumber water drink is simple and unsweetened. Refreshing.   In and outdoor seating. Quick service."}
{"text":"Yes, it does have a modern-rustic decor. In and outdoor seating. Parking is easy. Walk into restaurant and order your dish. Select the fresh toppings behind the glass wall.   The chix and steak on the rotating vertical spit were flavorful without overdoing it on the spices/garlic. Their salad  is a mixture of fresh cut lettuce, cabbages, beans, cucumbers and tomatoes. The steak meat on my salad plate were crispy smaller pieces of about 1 cup of meat. I expected the shaved gyro style of 1/2 inch meat strips, but their layered steak style spit mound made for smaller but crispier tidbit pieces. Good.  The hummus was outstanding. I would've been happy just eating the hummus and pita if I had to.  I diluted their green cucumber lemonade drink with water and ice. Refreshing. Too sweet for this sour-puss.  Want to try their curries next.  Price point is very reasonable. I like that you can pick and choose your veggie toppings and  sauces. Great concept."}
{"text":"First, the service: we've experienced an inconvenience after our order was bumped by a large to go order, resulting in a long 25-30 minutes wait, and my kabob being over cooked. Fernando comped some of our food, but most importantly he seemed sincere in his apology, and seemed to understand our inconvenience rather than treating our complaint as a nuisance. The beef kabob was good (aside from being overdone in my case) and the accompanying jasmine rice flavorsome, the falafel was alright (a little too spicy), and the Hummus dip topped with Kalamata olives was pretty good. Their house made Cucumber chiller drink, probably made with melons and cucumber is very refreshing and a great alternative to sodas. The only dessert on the menu, Baklava, was however average."}
{"text":"I've dine at ur place many times. And it's 5 out of 5 times that ur stupid peta show up with molds. Pls check ur food . Stop serving mold food!!! If I get one more shitty food from ur establishment I will call dirty dining !"}
{"text":"I have tried alot of Mediterranean restaurants around vegas and this one is my favorite.  It's small  but has lots of flavors.  The staff is friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the Chicken Shawarma to go. Fresh, delicious ingredients. Fast, friendly service. An \"A\" rating. And decent portions for the price. Just needed a bit of salt and pepper, but otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"Drove by this place multiple times and finally got a chance to try it. Walked in to a beautifully decorated restaurant and a large menu. A large, confusing menu.. Here's the gist of it though: choose your meat (chicken/steak/kabobs/vegetarian) and how you want it (bowl, plate, wrap, or salad). Bowls include salad, rice, & meat and spicy pickles carrots. Add on items such as other salads or toppings are $1 extra. Plates are like bowls, but the items are just separated.. Other options are available too, like chicken curry or baguette sandwiches. Add about $2-4 to get a drink and a side like parsley fries or hummus.  After an explanation of the menu by the nice owner, my boyfriend settled on a steak bowl and me a chicken bowl. We had a tzatziki sauce on our bowls, which looked beautiful!  The taste was a tad disappointing though. I expected a stronger flavor from the tzatziki. Meats were lacking in flavor and quite dry, but hopefully that's because we came in late at night. The dish needed something more flavorful. The parsley fries were the star- crunchy skin and soft inside.  Nothing to wow me here, but it was worth a try!"}
{"text":"Went here today and the food was amazing and friendly service too! Me and my son are picky eaters and we both loved the stake bowl it was delicious! The stake by it self was just amazing and the rice and lettuce just made it even better! Definitely going back in the near future for lunch! The staff was friendly and let us try samples before choosing our meal."}
{"text":"I've driven by this spot so many times and mentally noted a future stop. Today I was trying to think of a good spot to grab food since I was on my own for dinner. Parsley came to mind since it was on the way home and would be healthier than many other options.  The shop features large boards above the ordering area outlining the various food options. I did have to ask what was included in a beef kabob bowl versus a beef kabob plate (they are the same). I decided on a Beef Kabob bowl, Hummus, and Baklava. At this time I was also warned that the kabob would be a 10 minute wait. It wasn't a big deal since I was told ahead of time. Next visit I'll probably call in my order now that I know the lead time.   The Beef Kabob plate was really good. The beef kabob was tender and full of delicious seasoning. There was also a lot of meat included. The salad was fresh and had a really refreshing, light dressing on it. The rice was simple, but delicious. It worked really well mixed in with the salad. The tzatziki dressing on top was tasty and didn't drown the other flavors. The bowl came together like a Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl. The hummus was creamy and delicious with soft pita on the side. The baklava was pretty good too. All of the food I enjoyed tasted fresh.  The food was inexpensive. My bowl was around $9 and had plenty of food for a satisfying meal. The side and dessert were inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Wifey and I visited Vegas and was craving some middle eastern food.  We like chicken shwarma so looked up this joint.  Reviews were nice enuf so we decided to give it a try.  We ordered two Large Chicken Shawarma wrap combos.  Chose seasoned fries for the side and a small fountain drink you can refill.  The shawarma was pretty good. The wraps were huge. I noticed they had garlic paste so asked for some and the server slapped some of that in before wrapping them up.  Love the garlic paste!  Enuf greens and decent amount of meat.  Have to say I'm used to having more meat vs greens and other fillings.  But it was a nice balance.  The fries were much better than most burger joints!  Nicely crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Came with their special mayo/thousand dipping sauce which complimented the fries very well.  Will definitely come back!  Piece out!!!"}
{"text":"A great place where you can eat healthy if you choose and prices are reasonable. Also everything has tasted amazing the few times I have eaten here"}
{"text":"I write this review with a heavy heart because I do love the food and the woman who took my catering order was very nice. However, on the day of my son's birthday party, the food was not delivered at the scheduled time even though I called the order in a week in advance.  I scheduled delivery for 2:15 and the party started at 2:30. I even called that morning to confirm the order. I called them at 2:45 and could not get anyone to pick up. I had to call at least seven times before anyone answered. By then, all of the guests had arrived. Thankfully we ordered pizza for the kids. When they finally answered, the girl on the phone said the food was ready to be picked up - not that the delivery was on the way. She later called back and said no one informed them that it was supposed to be delivered. The food arrived an hour and a half after the scheduled time. It was cold and everyone had filled up on pizza. They threw in a big bag of STALE baklava to \"make up\" for their mistake.  I was hoping for a call from the owner, but never got one. I tried to reach out to her the following Monday with no luck.   We were left with a ton of leftovers that we couldn't finish. It was $175.00 down the drain. It was such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great heathy food. Great service. Looks like their employees are treated nicely. Love the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Even though I let them know I was the yelp grubhub order. They still served 10 walks ins that came after me. Ignored my note about wanting to choose sauces. Nothing like the SW one. Might try again but be maybe not through the app."}
{"text":"The food at Parsley is still solid and always has been.  The servers/staff on the other hand has gotten to be a problem.  On my last two visits, I got some major shade/attitude from the lady making the orders.  One example:  I ask for some chopped cucumbers and tomatoes in my Chicken Plate.  She replies \"that'll be an extra charge because the salad mix already has cucumbers and tomatoes.\"  In the past, I've never been given this answer.  Plus, there were like 2 tiny cubes of cucumber and 1 itty bitty piece of tomato in the salad portion.  My entire chicken plate experience was like this.   Note to management:  teach your employees to be kinder...a happy customer is worth 10000x more than an ounce of veg.  The food is good, but at times I feel they're trying to nickel and dime you on every topping.  Additional advice to management:  Arrange the damn ingredients in a way to CLEARLY show which cost extra....OR just don't charge extra for these things.  Your customers will be grateful for that and make return visits.  It costs you so little for these ingredients. #bereal"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Healthy, yummy, and all the ingredients are very fresh! Get a bowl with nice romaine lettuce underneath. It's deeeeelish!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at Parsley.  The Falafel Wrap with Jalapeno.Serano sauce, Steak Shwarma Bowl with fresh salad and rice, and Baklava were delicious and healthy.  We know that the Mediterranean diet is the healthiest for optimal health and when we found out about this restaurant, we had to try it.  We moved from Northern California last year and really loved having a great place to get Mediterranean food both in San Jose and Morgan Hill.  Now, we have a great place here in Las Vegas.  We enjoyed speaking with the owners about their plans to add healthy options and we are excited to try their expanding variety of foods."}
{"text":"Parsley is an amazing place for those who like Mediterranean food. Their food is delicious and always fresh. I come here every week for the steak or beef kabob plate and I can't get enough of It! They offer the main meals in either a bowl, which will have the salad under the rice and your choice of meat; a plate, which will have all three side by side, or a wrap, which will have everything inside on a delicious wrap. They have all the items that are common in Mediterranean restaurants for you to add, some at no cost and some costing you an extra dollar.  You will have different options to make a combo and make the most out of your experience.  They love regulars and have a rewards program, you will get a code to text to a number or enter on the app they use called Perka, and each code count as one point. After 10 points you will get a meal for free!  Trust me, it's easy to get those 10 points as they are great with costumer service and their food rocks!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile, but I happened to be in the area of Parsley over this past weekend and decided it would be a good place to grab my lunch on my way back home from shopping.   I ran in while my husband sat in the car outside and found the place to be deserted. They had just open a few minutes prior, so I was concerned the meat wouldn't be completely ready - but it was. I ordered steak shwarma and opted for the wheat wrap. I got extra taziki sauce and red onion. I also got a slight sprinkling of feta cheese.  When I got home and opened my wrap it looked good - but the taste was MEH. The shwarma was very over-done, almost burnt tasting and crispy. The lady had shaved off the meat for awhile (I wasn't sure what she was doing), but apparently whatever it was, it yielded some not-so-great steak shwarma.   This is not close to where I live so I doubt I'll be hustling to make a return visit."}
{"text":"OUR NEWEST FAVORITE!!  We always ask for a half chicken, half beef curry plate. So filling & yummy. The staff is also extremely friendly! Love coming here."}
{"text":"I came for Take Out on a Wednesday afternoon using a $16 Groupon.   They were located on S Pecos Rd/E Sunset Rd in Las Vegas.  I ordered the Chicken Shwarma bowl ($7.95) and 3 skewers of beef ($2.95 each).  There were about 6 pieces of meat with vegetables on each skewer.  It was burned and very dry.  Next time, I would ask for the meat to be grilled medium rare and at a lower temperature.  I will be back to use the other half of the Groupon."}
{"text":"THIS IS HANDS DOWN, ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN THE CITY.  I do not frequent a lot of fast food restaurants, but this place is levels beyond anything else.  Hands down, the best falafel in Las Vegas, period.  The falafel is always fried fresh to order and they are very good about custom orders (my boyfriend is not a cucumber fan, so he always gets a fresh salad made).   The house-made hummus is also very tasty, and the fries are delicious. Their red hot sauce will make your tongue insanely happy. I love this place so much.  I'm only sad there isn't a location closer to my house and that they aren't open just a bit later so I can have it when those late-night cravings hit."}
{"text":"Great food! Inexpensive! Good place to eat at off the strip and for a reasonable price. We got a steak plate and a chicken plate. Both were good. The cucumber water was refreshing."}
{"text":"Manager never called me back despite leaving two messages. I thought a good manager would appreciate customer feedback, but perhaps not."}
{"text":"Shawarma wrap is a must. Incredible service pleasant staff. Very clean. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a very specific craving for a chicken kabob wrap stuffed with an assortment of salad fixings, and took to Yelp to figure out where I could satisfy it. It took a good half hour of sleuthing to figure it out, but eventually I was led here, where I was ultimately quite satisfied. For $9 I got an ample portion of perfectly spiced and cooked chicken, in a large whole wheat wrap, with a good assortment of veggies, hummus, and tzatziki. The serving size was generous enough that I could've made two meals of it - and shoud've, but didn't.  If I lived in Vegas I'd likely eat here at least once a week, and would probably get the exact same thing each time."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the BEST falafel I have had in the Las Vegas area!  The staff is friendly and know their products well. The manager came to my work a few weeks ago and dropped off free pitas & hummus.  The freshly made hummus was AWESOME! We all got coupons for flatbread sandwich & drink for $5.99 and buy one get one half off.  I was there today because I didn't want to grab a fast food lunch, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"$8 steak and hummus bowl and a whole wheat bread, $10 w/ two add ons. I don't think the price is quite worth it after all of it. Only because the flavor is not too great. It's all around very salty. I was able to try the meat, hummus, and Babaganoosh separately, but when put together it's just all very salty and doesn't really come together. I will come back to try something else with my coupon. Just be aware. Groupon leads you to the restaurant.com certificate. So you pay $4 for a $10 certificate, then need to purchase a minimum of $20. So in the end you still play $10 after your visit. It's probably best to just purchase the groupon deal to avoid spending extra in store. I told the woman about the groupon leading to the restaurant.com website but she tried to shut me down."}
{"text":"The best ever!!!!!! Food is amazing! Customer service is amazing! Everything is amazing. I mean everything on the menu. Make sure to try everything!!! I crave Parsley food all the time! Healthy and good food!"}
{"text":"If you don't have the Greek nachos you are a mental defective. Big portions. Big flavor.  Always busy to expect to wait. But its worth it."}
{"text":"What a find! Stumbled upon this small eatery, enjoyed every bite of the curried chicken, same goes for the tasty hummus and the falafel was awful...... good. Workers added to the high marks, patient and helpful, and graciously gave us samples of almost everything on the menu board! Get out of the overpriced and ho-hum restaurants in the Casinos! Mmmmm good"}
{"text":"Best \"Parsley nachos\" EVER! Omg it totally hit the spot .. Mediterranean food is one of my favorite cuisines & this place is so authentic and clean at the same time!  The Groupon is totally worth it too!  Jo the cashier was so friendly, explained what the items came with. I ordered 2 chicken platters, the parsley nachos, an order of the falafels that came with hummus & another side of hummus and pita bread. The chicken was very moist & the platters were good portions.  The cucumber chiller was also very refreshing! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from where I work so I decided to give it a try. I got the chicken bowl which was surprisingly big in portion. There were lots of big fresh Mediterranean flavors which I love. And you can choose the toppings for your salad which is nice. My only negative comment would be that the chicken was slightly overcooked, but great flavor. I will be going back to try their other items as well."}
{"text":"The food here is not bad but the service is HORRIBLE.  The lady behind the counter was rude beyond rude, she was yelling at people and not listening to anything anyone was saying.  The people in front of us asked for a specific item and she totally ignored her.  Then came our turn and I ordered a chicken bowl with no rice but I got rice anyway.  We wanted a side of chicken curry to go and she kept insisting on giving me a combo plate.  I finally had to raise my voice and tell her very sternly I ONLY WANT A SIDE, NO COMB.  She was very annoyed.  This is the rudest service I've ever had and unfortunately it does not look like management reads reviews as I've not seen any responses to other reviews so nothing will change here.  I do not recommend this place unless you have patience to deal with them because you will not be treated respectfully here.  I wish you the best of you choose to go here."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this a one-star is because the food was half decent. The service was absolutely terrible..  There was a combo deal that was advertised outside and inside there was a sign which mentioned it came with a drink. However, the lady working there said that it does not include a drink. We only realized this after we left instead of asking her why. In addition, when I went up to ask for hot sauce, the same guy who helped me didn't recognize me and asked if I ordered take out. I mean it's not like it was busy or a large place.. We sat right in front. Just thought that was funny.   However, the curry was very bland and seemed to have less quantity than the actual chicken or steak bowls. The bowls are very large, could be shared between two people. They are pretty good. Just be aware of the pricing and what you are getting beforehand."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday, in the library, with an appetite.  No, I wasn't caught while playing Clue, I was planning what to do!  Eric R. and I were with friends at a community grant meeting and they were hungry.  They raved about Parsley so off we went.  Upon arrival, we mentioned we were newbies, and were immediately provided with lots of samples: chicken and steak schwarma, chicken curry, and beef tagine.  Eric, who planned on schwarma before we even got there, changed his tune and ordered a small chicken curry plus a side of pita (50 cents).  It was tasty, but I am not sure exactly what kind of curry it was.  It was creamy and enhanced with turmeric.  On a side note, my mother-in-law and I have a joke about naming children after spices.  Eric has a cousin with the middle name Sage, which his mom doesn't like.  I told her to honor my husband I can name my child Turmeric.  Anyway, back to the food.  I love bowls.  No, that does not mean I went to Taco Bell to try a cantina bowl or KFC for a potato fried chicken corn and cheese biscuit bowl...no no no.  I like rice bowls though - Chipotle burrito bowls, sushi rice with fish on top bowls/chirashi, rice topped with anything in general is just very appealing to me.  Parsley has bowls!  I got the steak schwarma bowl - Israeli salad on the bottom, yellow rice, steak schwarma, tahini sauce.  I asked for the 3 hot sauces on the side (green is mild but yummy and chimichurri -like) and the 2 red sauces are hot.  I am not sure which was supposed to be hotter - one was too weird tasting for me, but the deep red oily one was really good and I spread it on the top of my bowl.  It was huge.  Though the curry comes in 2 sizes, the bowl is only one and I had to have Eric R. finish it.  There are many good things on the menu to try, including baguette sandwiches!  They also have kabobs.  Fresh, relatively healthy food, and fast!"}
{"text":"The Shawarma is a little too greasy for my liking but the grilled kabobs are awesome! Only downside is they take 20 minutes to cook but I guess good things can't always be rushed.  The curry chicken is also pretty good but they use Shawarma meat for that so it can be a little fatty."}
{"text":"Never come back again .No costumer service .I came in,the lady told me to wait 10 min .31 min past by they serviced about 11 people and still burned my chicken and they told me on my second order they were out of falafel .So hungry.Fuck this place .Driving to a different place."}
{"text":"The BEST hummus in town. Reasonably priced and the food is AMAZING. I have eaten here at least ten times. I recommend the food to all of my friends and everyone I've taken here raves about it. I wish I could give it more than five stars!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick Mediterranean lunch. I'm usually pretty rushed since my lunch time is short, but the service here is pretty quick.  Environment: it seems like a lot of people from local businesses come here to grab a quick lunch. It's a pretty small store and is exactly what it is, a small clean and fair priced restaurant. It is similar to a cafeteria in the way that you wait in line and select your options, so not really a spot to eat and have long conversations.   Service: the staff were friendly and had the line moving pretty quick. They are a little bit rushed since the line is usually consistent, but I didn't mind it since I was rushed on time as well.  Food: the food is good, I say you have the option of eating healthy or having a heavier meal here which is nice. I have had the chicken and steak plate before with the rice, it is really good and doesn't feel super heavy but you do get full. I enjoy salads more for lunch, and I think their chicken and beef go well with it. Their beef and chicken are cooked on a doner, those large revolving heated flame stick, so it has a little bit of a burnt taste to it which I kind of liked. They also have many other Mediterranean options like pita bread, hummus and tzatziki sauce.  All in all, great location for Mediterranean food. It's quick and you don't feel too heavy or tired when you head back to work."}
{"text":"Very delicious food in love with cucumber drink, couldn't decide what I wanted and one specific Gentelman whipped up something very amazing for me! By the name of Jamil great service! Thanks you and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my co-worker, she came into work from her break carrying some food from here and it smelled SO GOOD! It had my mouth watering and craving it instantly! I would always pass by the restaurant and never thought twice about it, but I'm glad I stopped back a few months ago for the first time!   If anything I would say they need to work on customer service and quality of service. Sometimes the staff is extremely friendly and hospitable other days it's like what did I walk into?! I've been here about five times now and it's just totally unpredictable what type of service you'll get.   Other than their service THE FOOD IS AMAZING!! Minus the fact that you pay extra for a lot of the sides, you get a lot for what it's worth! I pay $14 for my beef shawarma bowl with salad, rice, chick peas, quinoa, feta, tzaziki (?) & hummus. It's bowl that takes me two sittings to finish because it's a pretty big size. I have yet to try anything else on the menu, I pretty much just go for my usual.   Side note: they usually cook the kabobs fresh to order so it does take a while (between 5-15mins depending if they already had extras on the grill). So it'd be smart to order ahead so that you don't wait too long!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I absolutely love the falafel bowl! Lots of fresh greens included, and the portion is generous. I am a falafel lover, and while it's not the best I've ever had, I still do enjoy the falafel here!  Unfortunately, I have never been to the establishment and have only ever ordered delivery, so I can't say anything about that. Overall, I would suggest trying it out if you happen to be in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a mess of greasy, stringy meat soaked in way too much tzatziki. I wanted to take out my stomach and hose it off after eating here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Service is great and food is amazing!!  And Tammy is stellar!"}
{"text":"Riddle me this, my Yelpizzles who have already been to and reviewed this place. Why did it take me so long?  I think I have a new favorite lunch spot. We'll see how long it takes for me to get tired of it. As it stands, I went for lunch yesterday and I returned today. It's that delicious.  Yesterday, I was looking for something somewhat healthy and found Parsley through Yelp. I got a beef shawarma salad to go and I ate it at the parking lot along Sunset where people watch planes take off and land (or do other activities not related to aviation). I don't think I even saw a single plane because I was too busy enjoying my salad.  Today, I went back to try chicken instead, but once I saw what the guy ahead of me ordered, I basically told the lady, \"I want that.\" That being a gigantic half chicken, half beef shawarma wrap. For a slightly lower price, it seems like you get more food. What I like about the wrap is how it reminds me of the Doner Kebab--something we don't really have in Las Vegas.  For messy hands sake, I'll probably stick with the salad. In any case, I feel like you just can't go wrong with Parsley Mediterranean Grill."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today, absolutely FABULOUS!!! Also the customer service was excellent with an incredible happy atmosphere!!! I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"The Chipotle of the Mediterranean! Parsley nailed my intense yearnings for some good, cheap, quality grub in Vegas. You know that a restaurant is killin' it in terms of authenticity when it's the go-to spot for local Israelis!   I got the steak bowl which was awesome! I have to say that the rice really helped complement the steak and lettuce. They're extremely generous with their servings of hummus and chickpeas. The workers are super friendly and helpful.   I would definitely return to Parsley if I were ever in Vegas and wanting some real food off the Strip."}
{"text":"Let me tell you guys about this place,  It's absolutely wonderful. The place it self is clean, cute and charming. It has outdoor seating which is very nice as well.  The staff is extremely friendly and ready to help you order.  The food is amazing and extremely flavorful, portions are great for what you pay for.  If you are around the area definitely come and try it here it's worth it!    ** I would have shared a picture but it was to good to stop and take one."}
{"text":"I've been on a Mediterranean food binge lately, drove past this place on my way to the coffee shop on Sunset.  Been there three times since, pretty good food and on the cheap."}
{"text":"This is Chipotle for Mediterranean food. And it. is. delicious.  I've only been here once because the location is very inconvenient for me, but if you are slightly less lazy, it's totally worth the drive.  If you like spicy, I highly recommend the red sauce. It will not disappoint. If you aren't great with spicy food - don't risk it. This stuff is legit!   I won't recommend specific items because everything seems to be great - if you like red meat, go for it. If you're into chicken - you do you. It's all good! Whatever you do, don't go light on the tzatziki!"}
{"text":"This is Chipotle for Mediterranean food. And it. is. delicious.  I've only been here once because the location is very inconvenient for me and I'm extremely lazy about driving more than 5 minutes to go anywhere, but if it were closer, I'd be here all the time.  (It's probably better this way, I have very little self-control.)  If you like spicy - get the hot sauce.  Mix it with the white sauce, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were met at the door and welcomed by owners Ygal and Debi.  This is one of those increasingly popular fast casual restaurants where you order and pick-up at the counter.  We took one look at the dried out meat on the vertical rotisseries and decided to order cooked to order chicken kabobs that included yellow rice, salad, txatziki sauce, and a pita.  Hardly gourmet or best of the city, our meals proved to be economical, tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food!   The guys behind the counter were friendly and informative. Ordering is pretty simple, like chipotle. You choose a meat, a type of bread and whatever you want on top. I got the steak and it was great! Flavorful and tender meat. The vegetables were fresh too. The babaganoush wasn't my favorite but they do give you quite a hefty portion.   Definitely try out their cucumber drink while you're there too. Perfectly refreshing for a hot Las Vegas summer day and for dessert you must try their perfectly flaky baklava. Yum!"}
{"text":"The shawarma here is very good, fresh and cheap.  Definitely a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"Not usually big on mediterranean but this place has changed that.   We had the Beef Steak Baguette, falafel, & a side of extra hummus. Everything was exquisite.  The service was excellent and the restaurant was perfectly clean.   Tip: the garlic spread and green serano hot sauce are a must. They'll allow for half chicken, half beef so try both!"}
{"text":"Tried this after a groupon and the food is very good :D  The grape leaves, babaganoush, and tzatziki were awesome, the salad that comes with the plate was great too. The chicken schwarma was not the best I've had but still good, I was a little disappointed with the portion of meat you receive for the schwarma plate though and extra meat is very pricey. The hummus was a little different and trust me, I've had a lot of hummus different places over the years but it grew on me, not sure what they do different but I did end up liking it. Overall I would definitely come here again :)"}
{"text":"Parsley is my absolute favorite fresh and fast food place in LV!  The ingredients are fresh and combine well in a salad.  Love the red sauce- spicy & full flavor!!"}
{"text":"Food and service, including the owner, are amazing! Wraps are ginormous and tasty! I ate half and have enough leftover for dinner. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Found this place when I visited Starbucks. Thought I should try it since I love Mediterranean food.  The place is a bit small specially during busy lunch time. They have a patio with tables and chairs. It's basically build your own bowl/salad/entre type. I love the fresh options they have to select from. The chicken and beef options are literally cut out in front of you from the revolving gyro machine. The salad I got was tasty and healthy. I would come back here, specially for lunch. Bring your coworkers."}
{"text":"I had the shawarma the first time I went and really liked it but they kind of over did it with the dressing. Next time I went they put it on the side and much better. Love how fresh their food is."}
{"text":"Great little spot for beef and chicken shawarma sandwiches , awesome staff friendly owner , highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Real dirty place whit a lot of homeless people hanging out. Other then that food is average."}
{"text":"Great little place for a healthy snack.  This food type isn't for everyone but they offer a vegan menu or option for most of their items.  Good portion sizes.  Love that they're near by. Fresh food beats the Jack in the box that was across the way."}
{"text":"The menu is kind of confusing. Needs pictures. Ordered the Chicken plate. Think we got chicken salads instead... felt like a salad. I guess pita bread comes with it but have to pay 1.00 to get hummus. Would have been nice to know before. Had to swipe my card twice. I asked if the menu changed and was told that it was new management and everything. Liked it better before. I did leave a tip though. Edit: The food is delicious and healthy. Affordable with good portion sizes. Update: The owner wrote me and is wanting to make it right. So that's good that they are responsive and care."}
{"text":"Food was ok, problem was my son's kabob was estimated at 15 minutes. Sat there for 30 watched the girl give it to another customer she was too busy flirting with. Didn't get the said Kabob until I wanted my money back. Wouldn't recommend for the prices, I'm sure there is better out there!"}
{"text":"I love Parsley! Every item on their menu has a unique taste. My favorite is the falafel appetizer. Try it!"}
{"text":"Good food & reasonably priced whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Dont know if theres another name for it but the steak salad with feta is like 2 meals and incredible... price was great as well... young girl behind the coubter helped me choose since i have no knowledge of greek food"}
{"text":"Went here a few times on lunch with co-workers, and I honestly can't even remember what I had, any of the times I was there; the most recent having been yesterday. It was something with chickpeas.  While that probably says a lot right there, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near where I like my Mediterranean fare to be. There was nothing special or memorable to it, and it was sort of overall quite bland. Possibly because it's not Persian or Greek or Moroccan, but some sort of Americanized, averaged version of all the widely varied cuisines that get lumped into \"Mediterranean\". It's a sort of \"health-food-ified\" Frankenstein that has all the right parts of delicious Mediterranean food, but they just aren't working quiiiiite right.  Food alone would give it 3 stars, though. I never feel oogy after eating it, and it is what it advertises.  What knocks it down to two, is the fact that every time I come in, I'm treated very rudely. One of my co-workers with a stamp loyalty card who was buying another co-worker who forgot his wallet in his desk lunch tried to get two stamps, and was actually yelled at. On another occasion I was given the third degree for asking for napkins with my takeout. There's a rather snarly atmosphere of \"the customer is trying to pull the wool over our eyes and steal our plastic cutlery!\" that just does not impress."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch .. place was busy .. plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.   The meat cooking on the spit smelled amazing .. lots of fresh ingredients to add to your bowl, salad or wrap..   Today I had the chicken bowl with salad & rice, added cucumber, tomato, garbanzo and the red \"fire\" sauce for a bit of heat .. easy on the tzatziki sauce.. it was tasty and very filling!  I would recommend this place & would definitely return to try the steak option!!"}
{"text":"The food was good; the falafel was the best we have found in town. The employees were very difficult to understand which made the experience less pleasant. The menu should be a little more descriptive."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh, satisfying and filling meal this one is a gem, serving Mediterranean beef or chicken bowls, loaded with sides and options to add homemade, taboulie, babaganoush and eggplant salads. Definitely grab their homemade, cucumber chiller fountain drink, refreshing and tasty. We also met the owner and all the staff are super friendly, front guy Ryan was very attentive and personable. Would be great if they'd add coffee, Turkish coffee to the menu."}
{"text":"I have been needing to write a review for this place. Since this place opened I have tried multiple dishes. The last time I came in, my bf ordered a burger medium; When I say this is the best burger he has ever had, I mean they whole-heartedly went out of their way with an art. He said this is the best he ever had. This man usually complains no matter how legendary a restaurant is. I ordered the caprese salad which was memorable in every bite."}
{"text":"We ate here several times during our stay in LV. I loved their chicken and beef kebob and their babaganoush is AMAZING! The staff are really kind and helpful, they always greated us w a big smile."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was the only place i would get falafels. Tried several others and they just fell short. I ate a falafel wrap yesterday and it was delicious as always. However today i got one and noticed an odd taste.  I discovered the falafels were the culprit. They were very crunchy inside. Usually they are soft.  My immediate worry was undercooked beans, and I recognized the odd taste to be similar to the taste of chickpea flour Ive used in gf baking. I called and asked if they use raw chickpeas and they confirmed, yes they do. So I started freaking out because I know undercooked beans are toxic.  I only ate about 2 falafels, and I kno undercooked chickpeas arent as toxic as undercooked Kidney beans, but still. Not cool. I get that mistakes happen...but that is a pretty big one. Make sure to check that ur food has been cooked properly if u eat here."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, and fast! My only wish is that we would have found it sooner on our trip."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places. Now none of the employees speak English and its a terrible annoyance to try and get what you want."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! I have been here 3 times so far and I will continue to come!  Super yummy wraps and fast service! My go-to place when I'm on the go. I love the wheat steak wrap with extra hummus! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We love it here and eat here frequently. The food is fresh, the prices great and the service is good. After 10-20 visit see still have never had a complaint. Try it out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The place was pretty empty, but while we were eating many people came in for take out. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. Would come back!"}
{"text":"While the food is good, I would appreciate it more if less oily. Also, after being around here for a bit, I couldn't help but notice that the service isn't great. It's not terrible, but I would suggest that some employees may need to be retrained for how they see and/or treat their customers.  This is just my advice for how they can improve, and my explanation should serve partial reasoning behind my rating."}
{"text":"I go to Parsley about once a month. Every time I go, they are out of rice. This is the third time they were out. When they don't have rice, you can have a salad or a wrap without rice. It is so frustrating. This time it was a 25 minute wait for rice. Last two times it was 15 minutes. They couldn't even fulfill a call-in order. I will not be back. I have 30 minutes for lunch and it does not allow for bad service. Very unhappy!"}
{"text":"#latereview 8/13/2015  I came here after hearing so much about it from a couple of friends and I was in the mood for Mediterranean, so I decided to come check them out.  It was such a hassle trying to find the place. I even walked in to a different restaurant, thanks Google maps fail! Haha. But after finding the restaurant I decided to go right in.  I ordered the Chicken Curry and a side of hummus and pita chips.  Chicken Curry  - 4/5  The flavor was ok. I wasn't a big fan of it, but I wasn't unimpressed either. The flavor, although ok, felt like it was lacking something... that extra oomph that would make me want to come back and try something else on their menu. On the bright side, the Asian in Mr enjoyed the saffron rice more than the main entree itself, so I'll give them that. Rice was fluffy and not soggy. The rice was the saving grace of this dish.  Hummus and Pita Chips - 4/5  No matter where I go and try different forms of hummus, I will always be critical because I have been spoiled by a fellow coworker and friend's hummus. Yes I understand that Tahini is part of the ingredient but I am very partial to garbanzo beans. I want to taste the garbanzo and tahini working together, not just straight out tahini. And yes I am an avid salt user but the pita chips had to give me pause as it was a little bit too much salt for me.  If the craving for Mediterranean hits me again, this will not be the first thing that pops in to my mind. But if I'm in the area doing errands, I will definitely give them a try again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portions are huge. I love having it for dinner and lunch the next day. The workers are always friendly and the pricing is perfect. I love this place!"}
{"text":"These people need to work on there customer service skills. They are rude as hell with they nasty ass food. Get it together parsley!"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma bowl was pretty good. The guy was kinda stingy on the sauces lol the tahini and tzatziki sauce could be tastier. We tried the steak nachos and the meat was kind of tough. Some were chewy and fatty and wasn't edible. We also had the falafel and it was a little salty. I did enjoy the cucumber chiller. It was nice and refreshing. I see the appeal of the place tho. It's fast and there's something about seeing your food prepared right in front of you. The portions are pretty big and the workers are also friendly. They didn't have baklava today so we were pretty bummed."}
{"text":"The feel of the place seems to be for university students ready for a take out.  I ordered the special which was tagine and it was dreadful.  I could not finish it.  It was a sloppy brown congealed beany mess.  I can't believe they were willing to serve it.    I tasted my boyfriend's shawarma and I have had better when I went to school in California."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices, not a big fan of Bbabaganoush normally but here it is awesome."}
{"text":"Quick and quality Mediterranean.  The chicken salad or wrap are my regular orders. The hummus is solid as well.  I suggest the feta fries as well."}
{"text":"Got the chicken salad with tahini dressing and scoop of eggplant salad on the side. I loved it!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for vegetarians. You will probably get the best Falafel in Las Vegas here. We had Falafel wrap and Baklava.   Very responsive staff. They are also very happy to tell you about what goes into each of the ingredients. Very happy with this place."}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed. I had the steak bowl and the portion was extremely generous with a reasonable price. And I loved the cucumber chiller, but it's true, you need to love the taste of cucumber to enjoy.  I'd say the parsley fries were not my favorite and while the employees were extremely nice, they seemed a little ill prepared for large groups.  There was a person in front of my group ordering six items to go and it really backed things up. I'll definitely be back though - the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious bowls, plates, wraps...and more served just the way you chose to create... Generous proportions, very tasty, friendly staff, nice neighborhood atmosphere. Busy, so they are well established with many clientele...of all shapes, sizes, dress, and more. You won't leave hungry...along with an enjoyable dining experience. Casual...clean, and easy access. All the best Parsley Modern Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Great service p homemade hummus is delicious the bully was also very tasty chicken was okay I enjoyed their beef kabob salad"}
{"text":"I'm Israeli. There for I know Israeli food. Usually I'm skeptic about places this. But I stand corrected. Probably the best \"chipotle\" style Israeli food. Not as good as home, but the closest. Quick, tasty, affordable. I'm a regular. Trust me. I know food."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot anytime I want something healthy and super filling! Think chipotle but Mediterranean style! My go to is the chicken shish kebab or the beef is really good too. It takes longer to cook because it's cooked on a skewer on the grill fresh made to order, and the other kind of chicken and beef is shaved off a rotating skewer so it's less fresh. Plus it's the same price and the quality is much better with the skewer, in my opinion. If you order it in bowl form, which is the best way to get it, they put rice salad any extra veggies you want and the meat of your choice. It is a huge portion and always gets me full. It's also pretty healthy. I like to add kalamata olives and babaganoush (roasted eggplants with the consistency similar to hummus). Also Each add on is around a dollar which is totally worth it! They also have this delicious cucumber water drink. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. I come in here at least once a week I always crave it now."}
{"text":"This place was a little further from my hotel around 15 mintue drive. The place is small but cozy. They have bowls and platters available. I decided to order a bowl with chicken shawerma. I wish they added more sauce to the bowl because it can get dry with just the shawerma and rice. It was more of a healthy option than the typical shawerma places. The bowl also included some pita bread. Overall it was good service and good food."}
{"text":"Mediterranean fast food. Food is very tasty, though, but this is not the place to go if you want ambiance."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, delicious food at affordable prices. Comfortable atmosphere with outside seating. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Such a surprise delight!  I've been to enough Mediterranean restaurants to wonder immediately if the rotisserie meat is going to be juicy or dry.    First bite of the chicken at Parsley allowed me to say \"YES!!!\" It's juicy, it's flavorful, it's just done right. If you can't decide between steak and chicken, simply get half of each for your shawarma salad.  Click on your Yelp check-in and get a delicious desert for free.  The baklava is absolutely delicious and crispy.    The place is clean and well maintained.  It's located in a shopping plaza along with Starbucks and Denny's.  Worry free on parking."}
{"text":"WE LOVE IT HERE! Their food is so fresh and they are always so friendly. I just found out about this place a week ago and have eaten there twice already. One of my faves!"}
{"text":"More satisfying than eating a a buffet in Vegas. My new favorite place to eat in Vegas. Great quality food and excellent service. We ordered bowls and they are HUGE and so delicious. There is a very good business running here the owners and staff should be proud of it."}
{"text":"First off this is my first review on yelp. I don't do reviews. That should mean it's either really good or really bad for me to post this to the public. Unfortunately this is a really bad one. 4 stars? Wow! What are people thinking? This place is horrible! Salad was old and full of water with nothing else really. Whatever that white sauce with cucumbers in it I believe was nasty. I'm assuming it was a type of taziki sauce. Chicken is fine if u like unseasoned meat just grilled. I expected more marination of sorts. Basically no effort except cutting chicken and putting it on the grill. My girlfriend bought two meals. I had the chicken kabob. The yellow rice is completely tasteless. I could buy one of those instant rice packets at the store and been more satisfied for .99 cents. Not sure how this place is still in business. Wouldn't go back for free. I would not recommend it to anyone! If you think this is even half way decent food from anywhere, well I feel sorry for you and I should make you a meal that would easily surpass this place with just about zero effort. Just to let everyone know I had no expectations of this place good or bad. I would be happy to help the owners for free to provide a better product. I work for a very large hospitality company that serves all kinds of food and different types of experiences. This has to be one of the worst places I ever ate and paid for it. I'm a food and beverage manager in Vegas who is from Chicago and let me say this food needs a lot of help. Save your money. Really, if you need help I'd give my consultation for free if wanted. In fact I wouldn't mind a refund if possible. Sorry:("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is fresh and delicious! New favorite spot to eat at! Shout out to James and Tammy for such great customer service!"}
{"text":"The food was amazingly great... but I dined-in and had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA on how to order, and they weren't helpful. Before leaving I looked at a take-out menu that explains how to order \"The Parsley Experience.\" If this was included in the front of the line my experience would've been better and I would've given 4-stars. With that I would've given another star to make it 5-stars if they didn't charge a dollar extra for olives & quinoa & everything else that's laying out like a Subway sandwich line.   Check it out... but if you're confused on how to order then grab a take-out menu & read because you will hold up the line. YIKES!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on the reviews of fellow yelpers....  A co-worker had one at lunch and i inquired about it... He said it was a Shawarma Steak, in a pita with hummus, greens, and different sauces...  Looked huge and really good.  Well today i tried this shawarma for lunch...  I said you fly I buy, and off we went...  It was pretty busy at lunch but moved quickly... If you send a text to this # and type Parsley you get free hummus and a few pitas...  I have to say that was really good... Now this is my first time trying it so what did i know... It was good, so this is the one i will compare other hummus'es to..  I did the steak, and as others have stated its pretty large.  I could of finished it but i would of wanted to take a nap, so saved it..  My first bite was ike hmmmm,, ok this is good...  The pita, was soft and really fresh, the salad was good, complimented the hummus spread and the meat nicely,  There are sauces you can us to dip it in,, my boy did mine up..  He calls it a mediterrean burrito, which it pretty much was.. Most cultures have \" same as\" or \"a lot like\" dishes...  I went there looking for a GYRO but the older feller behind the counter said try this, gave me a sample of chicken of beef..  I am glad i tried something new.. I will try the beef kabobs, and the chicken. The baklava,,, once i had my friends ya ya's anyone else's recipe is marginal at best but I agree with our fellow yelpers,, this is a must try if you are in the area...  Corner of Pecos and sunset...  Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Wow... I was meeting a friend at the new Starbucks on the corner of Pecos and Sunset. My friend was late and I was hungry so thought I would give this Parsley Place a try. I was very impressed. I got the chicken curry, salad and a drink for $10. The chicken curry was very good. Tasted like home made and had very nice spice heat to it.  This place is really nice for a \"fast food\" type Mediterranean eatery. It reminded me of a Subway Sandwich type set up where you let them know what you want on your order while they make it in front of you.      For my drink they had a fresh lemon and cucumber water on the drink line which was so delicious and refreshing.       I love the decor and art in this tiny place. They like their high quality spices and you can tell. I will definitely go back. Thanks to my friend being late, I found a great place!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite awhile now after driving by it so many times. Went here with my daughter. It was lunch time and they were busy. The way the place is arranged does not really leave much room for a line of people. My daughter had the chicken shawarma wrap and I had the steak. First thing, the wraps didn't look appetizing at all. They just looked kind of blah. The first bite I took, the steak was hard and chewy. I had dispose of it in my napkin. I had to repeat that on several other bites that were just too tough to be edible. Also, there was too much sauce. I don't like my wraps dry so it takes a lot of sauce for me to say there is too much. My daughter did better with her chicken but she  said there was a few bites that tasted like there was sand in them. Needless to say , I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After eating holiday food for 2 weeks, mostly sweets & high-fat fare, I was craving a fresh, healthy meal. Thank you Yelpers for turning me on to Parsley. And thank you Groupon for offering me a good deal.   It's New Year's Day lunch & this place is pretty busy with a nice healthy vibe. Quite a few folks eating outdoors, large to-go orders heading out the door & always a couple people in line waiting to order. Maybe these customers have been ignoring good food, too, & have made resolutions?  This was my first time here & it was fun because Groupon \"made me\" get $16 worth of food-way more than I'd normally order. I ordered the Falafel Plate ($7.99) which came with 6 nice size falafel patties, salad, rice, a pita & tzatziki sauce. The falafel was delicious, as good as any I've ever had, & so was the chunky sauce. Salad was fresh as can be & plentiful & included chickpeas for a nice touch. I was asked if I wanted more of any of the ingredients added (no charge) & I added more tomato & cucumber. I also ordered a side of taboulli (or shall I just call it \"parsley\" because there was almost no bulgar to be found) & one of falafel ($3.99 each side). I think next time I'll just order a side of falafel with a couple of $1 toppings. (See my falafel pic.)   So the food was good but the ordering was just a bit complicated for the first time, trying to figure out what is what & what goes with what. (Like the Bowl & Plate are exactly the same except how they're arranged on the plate. Really?) The set-up is like Chipotle's but with lots more decisions to be made.  After placing my order I got caught up in looking at all the food toppings & mix-ins & sides & before I realized it 10-15 minutes had passed without my food in sight. I had originally figured the frying of the falafel was responsible for the delay so I asked & they asked me to repeat my order. How could they forget about someone in a line-up like Chipotle's? They did. I was feeling like a road block for the people behind me who had to pass me to get their food before me.  I'll definitely go to Parsley again but I won't get the taboulli nor a meal that includes that rice.  Lots of seating inside & out."}
{"text":"Please open a location in Summerlin!! :)   This place is amazing. It is small but the food is so good. My husband and I both had the Shawarma plate with rice and salad. You must eat this with their tzaki sauce, it was beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"So fresh. So amazing. Very clean and a great find for vegans staying on the strip who have a car! Short drive and parking is abundant!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant a lot. Delicious food. Freshly made. Clean, delicious, so flavorful! Spiced just right, for a perfect Mediterranean taste - highly recommended!!! The feta fries are absolutely amazing, lots of healthy choices - and the cucumber drink is to die for! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant a lot. Delicious food. Freshly made. Clean, spiced just perfectly - highly recommended!!! The feta fries are absolutely amazing, and the cucumber drink is to die for!"}
{"text":"I love the falafel wrap here. The falafel aren't dry at all. And they always accommodate my special requests."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma's I've ever eaten. First, it's so clean inside which I appreciate when eating at a place. Secondly, the staff is patient. Lastly, the food is beyond delicious. We ordered the nachos with chicken and one beef. The beef shawarma sandwich with the hot spread!!!! Yum!!! The Parsley fries are so crispy dipped in the Tzatziki sauce! And a beef shawarma bowl with yellow rice. I think you should top your food with all the goodies because it makes it that much better. And the sauces are so good! I'll be back, repeatedly!!!!"}
{"text":"You won't regret it. Had Beef Kabob and Chicken Wrap. So bomb. Try their garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Came to this place for the first time & it definitely met my expectations especially growing up to Mediterranean food. It's set up like a Chipotle but their version of it. Their chicken which is cooked off a rotisserie was the highlight because I value chicken being freshly cooked that way especially when it's fresh & hot. After being served on bowl with delicious salad & rice I specifically added extra tahini sauce (for extra charge) & it made the chicken come more alive with savory flavors. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The food always taste fresh and leaves me very full without feeling tired.  They have had a groupon for a very long time making this place an incredible value. This is my favorite Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"i'm hellova middle east cuisine connescior. i am extremely happy, proud, and will recommend to all !! very impressive..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing - so much flavor and so much food! I wish there was a Parsley in Seattle! If you are looking for healthy Med food this is your place! And there is enough to share one bowl with your other half!"}
{"text":"I cannot stop ordering from this place. So easy to order (Uber Eats), quick, delicious, and filling in a way where I don't feel bad over eating what I ate. The falafel bowl wrap is BOMB, and the Greek salad so good. I also enjoy the vegetarian varieties."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Babaganoosh Eggplant Salad Chicken Hummus Shawarma Bowl with Tzatziki Falafel Side with Tahini Warm Pita Baklava  Like many Las Vegas Restaurants, Parsley Modern Mediterranean began with the passion of immigrants, a man from Israel and his British wife originally meeting in Southern California before coming to Sin City and opening their first outpost in 2011, a second on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard added in 2015 and both continuing to operate under a business model based on tradition, affordability and healthiness.  Originally envisioned in the form of a Mediterranean Street Food stand back in Los Angeles, the concept reshaped into a quick-casual Restaurant with a focus on bold flavors featuring all-natural ingredients upon opening the first location on South Pecos, it was Saturday evening around Six o'clock that a visit was paid to Parsley Modern Mediterranean #2 on West Tropicana Avenue, the narrow space about 2/3 full with kids on their way to EDC as well as a couple of local families while two women and a man worked the counter.  Described by one fan as a \"Greek Chipotle,\" and favored by a respected local Chef as one of his go-to spots for healthy food, patrons approaching the counter at Parsley are directed to the end furthest the door in order to place an order, the idea a fairly simple one with three Proteins plus Falafel offered as everything from Bowls to Pitas or Platters, several traditional Dips and Side Dishes also available along with Baklava and Fountain Soda.  Fairly light in décor, a few Bookshelves and a mounted rack of Mediterranean Spices the only ornamentation aside from reclaimed wood and tile, it was after some perusal that the decision was made to order as wide a variety as possible with a focus on tasting, a bit of strategy allowing one to taste four Dips, a salad and two of the four 'Entrees' plus Dessert for under eighteen dollars.  Serving many of the traditional Foods one might expect to find at their local Greek restaurant, everything but the Panini-press warmed Pita Bread made in house daily, it was with 80% of the order in hand that a table was found directly across from the register, first bites of the spit-roasted Chicken noteworthy thanks to not only the juicy texture but also a bold hint of Herbs, the Hummus atop which it was situated a substantial portion dusted in Paprika and Parsley with tangy Tzatziki added at the end.  Taking a chance to unwrap the Pita, a second look at the menu later indicating that Parsley does indeed offer a housemade version for $1.00 more per piece, suffice it to say that the store-bought version does little to detract or add to either the smoothly pureed Chickpeas with a hint of Garlic or the smoky Babaganoosh bright with Lemon and Cumin while the Eggplant Salad is cool, slick and refreshing with thick-cut roasted chunks tossed in Tomatoes, Olive Oil and Peppers.  Told that the $3.99 side of six Falafel was owner Ygal's family recipe, the effort to fry them fresh appreciated even though the flattened shape led to a large surface area and thus a bit too much Oil, those who do not eat Meat are encouraged to taste the light green fritters for themselves with or without Tahini while anyone not on a diet would and without allergies would do well to finish with a small slice of Baklava available in many shapes, the traditional square featuring innumerable layers of Phyllo wrapped around ground Nuts and soaked in Honey.   ****A nearly perfect idea when accounting for location, nutrition, ingredients and price, Parsley Modern Mediterranean is the sort of idea America should be embracing instead of the suddenly 'clean' Panera or 1,000+ calorie Burritos, the menu well-culled and highly customizable with almost everything offered naturally low in fat and available by request without any added Oil."}
{"text":"Staff is poorly trained and bad attitude. They charged me the wrong price on my item and claimed it didn't matter what the menu board said, the register had a different price. When they finally agreed to refund the $1 difference, there was no apology, Just a look of \"how dare youdesire to be charged the correct price.\" Food was so-so."}
{"text":"Love the food best find in a long while, can someone help me out with how many calories or a nutrition guide to this place."}
{"text":"Love the food best find in a long while, need a little help with calories or a nutrition guide."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service I have ever encountered. There food wasn't anything amazing it's in fact dry. Came here to get a take out and they were rushing us to pick what we want. The one who took my order Jo didn't even bother putting the sauce in my order or asking me what I wanted to put in my bowl she just started putting whatever she thought I would like . I had to eat there dry bland food that has no flavor. Never eating or ordering here again."}
{"text":"Alecia helped me out At the counter she made my food superquick superquick and was very precise and she made sure I got all my sides. The food was freaking amazing so much bang for your buck I definitely just getting the Groupon and coming out here we got $16 with the food for 7.69$"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening and ordered  1. Parsley nachos $6 2. Chicken shwarma plate $9 3. Hummus $4 for $4.42 (Used the groupon $16 value for $8)  - The cashier was a bit fussy with the groupon. \"I don't think you can use the groupon on the same day.\" She asked one of the other employees, and she said that you can bc it says that it's valid. Boo-ya!  - Groupon SCAM! Check the receipt. Although, I'm not going to fight for 64cents. (-$7.36 wtf) Whatever... - She forced me to order more than $16 worth saying that its still under $16 before tax. I used Groupon many times, staying under the coupon value. This is a first.  - 2nd class citizen service. Groupon haters. haha. Oh well... - On to what really matters, the food was amazingly good for the price! - Very fresh vegetables! Although next time, no fresh onions with the nachos!  - Reminds me of a Mediterranean style Chipotle! - Hummus was great. I loved the olives and it comes with extra pita bread. - Some of the pita breads were hard to open and when I did, it ripped. xD - Although the pita chips appeared burnt, they were really tasty and good.  - The steak was very flavorful. The chicken, however, was somewhat dry. The hummus sauce did the trick!  - The meat are carved thin and marinated on a vertical skewer. Great aromatic flavors."}
{"text":"Always fresh and flavorful. Love the kebabs and falafel bowls. Please open one on the southwest!"}
{"text":"Amazing kebabs! They grill it to order. We got the rice/salad bowl and everything was fresh and delicious. Especially the chili sauces and cucumber juice. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian sampler plate-- AMAAAZING!!! I've always loved it here, just wish it wasn't so far from me now  Deffff got my money's worth, it was so filling and delicious. I'll be back for lunch real soon!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, this place exceeded my expectations. I ate here after a long drive and was desperate for any food and Parsley was good choice as I found out.  I got the Parsley Tuna on salad and some red quinoa and chickpeas with sauce that starts with a T that I dunno how to spell. It tasted great and the portions massive. Will for sure come back here when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"OMG a new fave place! Great for lunch or a meal on the run. Super fresh, delicious delights. Perfect for omnivores, gluten-free, paleo, vegetarian, vegan--it's all easy to do here. And a friendly staff too! Very stoked to have found this place. NE corner Sunset/Pecos."}
{"text":"Me really thinks not!  Maybe I visited during an \"off\" night, but nothing about this place left a good impression. We walked in during dinner time, and the first thing I sensed was the low energy lingering in the place. The meat grills were turned off and everyone was off doing their thing.   When they finally acknowledged us, they informed us they were out of chicken for one of their featured items. Really?!?  I ordered curry beef with rice snd, although the portions were huge, the food was hopelessly bland and unremarkable.  My girlfriend's lentil soup was no different-- it was a cup of mushy lentils with zero flavor.   I had really high hopes for this place, but I do not think I will be trying it again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loved it! We had a falafel bowl, steak shwarma bowl and pita chips. Everything was fresh, delicious and so good! Exactly what we needed after a few days of heavy 'travel food.' All we wanted was a quick, healthy meal and this place nailed it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food... But chicken wasn't cooked enough one time. And the falafel doesn't come with bread.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"I went there for a lunch with my friends. The place was so cozy and the food was mouth watering. I ordered beef shawarma plate. It came with a lot of salads. Everything was great, but I just felt the meat was not fresh and juicy. Except this it worth to try"}
{"text":"Tricky and deceptive!   -You can't put more than one stamp per visit even if u buy 3 entrées.  -You can't get the combo with Groupon.  I'd rather them not put out deals and promotions then do it and try to trick u at every turn into paying full price. There's something not right about it. It's funny cause I was fine paying full price when I first came to this place. It's just insulting they think they can chest you."}
{"text":"I'd seen this place for awhile ago and had been wanting to try it. I didn't go, my friend picked up lunch, so this is just a review on the food. I had the filafel wrap. It was good but not great, especially for the price. The onions were a little excessive and I had a hard time distinguishing different flavors over that. I've had worse filafels but I've definitely had better, at least outside of vegas."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite Mediterranean spots by far. Staff was friendly and the food was so yummy!!!! You should definitely open a location in Miami, FL"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the shawarma and what Parsley had to offer. I saw all the good reviews and pics looked good. I tried the beef Shawarma and chicken shawarma. I basically order the hummus shawarma bowl with a side of meat. I then ordered a combo with drink and pitta chips and more hummus. It was hummus overload. The shawarma was okay nothing  that popped in flavors. It was my fault that I ordered a hummus bowl, I think it's better to order a regular bowl with rice and then combo it and you'll get hummus any ways with the pita chips. The only thing that was good was the cucumber cooler that was refreshing. Overall it was ok, the free checking for dessert on Yelp is a choice of bakalava but it's way too sweet for me.   Maybe I'd give it another try but the flavors were to mono."}
{"text":"The good:  -The steak swarma is packed with flavor and is cut to a very generous portion.  -The babaganoush is smokey and overflowing with rich characteristics. -The salad is a mix of dark greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, purple cabbage, cucumbers and pickled carrot sticks.  The bad: -The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base. -Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.  I was amazed that I ordered everything for less than $18. I ended up taking so much of it home. With a few customized request, I could see myself loving Parsley."}
{"text":"Heads down for the best casual Mediterranean food in Vegas. First tried food at Parsley two years ago and since then became one of the regulars at this place. My favorites are shish kabob bowl and falafel plate. Oh yes, and must try is their cucumber chiller, it's the only place I know so far where they keep its original flavor. Overall friendly and always helpful staff create the certain type of atmosphere that you always want to come back again- not surprising that Parsley have so many returning customers. Thanks for feeding us Parsley team!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty and the servers are very prompt and make sure you get your food as quick as possible. This is not your average fast food place; if you want something like a kebab, you will need to wait between 10-13 minutes. The wait is well worth it; very, very delicious as well as nutritious food is your reward. Try this place, you won't regret! Way better than some of the overpriced places on the Strip. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Parsley has found itself as one of my regular visits for lunch lately.  I hate how everyone, including myself refers to a restaurant as \"Chipotle style\" but yes, essentially it's like Chipotle with Greek food.   You pick a wrap, salad, bowl, etc, a protein (chicken, beef, falafel) then a bunch of fixins.  I generally am the type who tries new things every other visit, even if I find something I like.  At Parsley I've pretty much stuck to the exact same order each time I've frequented:   Red Quinoa salad with added chicken (costs extra), and then I add the spicy carrots, some of the green sauce (everyone's got a green sauce nowadays), and some tahini.   The salad mix that you start with is fairly standard with lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, tomato with some garbanzo beans mixed in.   The vinaigrette as I've seen others state is mild, but tasty.   If you know nothing about red quinoa then we're in the same boat, and there's a list of health benefits that Parsley advertises that I can neither confirm nor deny, but I mean it's quinoa, so I can't imagine there's any sort of deception there right?  To be honest it doesn't add much more flavor than one would expect some scoops of quinoa would add to a salad, which is why the carnivore in me always has to add chicken as well.   I would prefer to do the chicken Kabob style vs Shawarma  style but it does take quite a bit longer for them to cook the kabobs vs just cutting it right off the giant spinning hunk of meat, so time wins that battle.   Side note:  the amount of different spellings of shawarma within the photos and reviews of this place are hysterical.   It's 2016 people, no excuse.  Anyhow, all of these components combine to form an extremely delicious salad, and there are enough options to satisfy anyone I would think [tzatziki instead of tahini, feta/olives/hummus options, fiery red sauce (BEWARE) over milder green sauce (which also packs a kick), etc]   The only downsides for me are sometimes the service seems a bit rushed.   It's always friendly, but I feel that sometimes my salad ends up with the person at the end of the assembly line before I can finish with the additions I wanted from the first person.   They get busy and want to stress the quickness factor which I understand.   Also I have a few times ordered a double order of chicken, and what I've received has been inconsistent.   Sometimes it's a giant heap of chicken, and other times it doesn't seem much different from the single.   Lastly some of the extras that you can add include an upcharge that I wish didn't.  Feta and olives to be exact.  It's especially frustrating for me because I really only want a tiny bit of each but don't want to pay the extra charge for the large amount they give you.  I realize it's a slippery slope for them though.   Minor grievances to what has always ended up being a fantastic meal.  One pro tip before I go:  if you want to indulge in either of the sauces, ask for them to give it in a separate container instead of having them put it directly in the bowl.   Much easier to distribute according to your own tastes that way."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat. The food is fresh, and unique. The workers are very helpful while ordering, especially Tami."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle for Mediterranean food, and it is delicious! The shawarma is perfectly cooked (crispy, but not dry), and the salad was super fresh and it had a good mix of greens. I also got the fries which were really good, but they are lightly battered (not what I wanted as I try to avoid grains/flour/gluten).  It's also super clean and the service was very friendly. A great place for quick, healthy eats!"}
{"text":"Parsley was always one of my favorite places until today. I was just about to order the beef tagine ( which is one of my favorite dishes) until I looked down and saw it sitting in a pan all dried out. It looked awful. So disappointed. Probably won't be back.  :("}
{"text":"Love it, the six piece falafel and hummus is crispy, very good but you need to help them keep an eye on the frying time or the'll come Extra done!  I usually get the wraps, they make their pita bread, spread with your choice of dressing and I get all the fillers! The chicken is my favorite.  Price is decent and the girls at the counter pretty friendly! I just wish it was closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"Great fast and cozy place; your buck goes a long way!  You have everything you want to add to a delicious gyro except lamb:( but the chicken was amazing!   Get some  lamb on those rotisserie poles please:)  Can't forget the friendly staff."}
{"text":"With all the good reviews, I'm a little surprised that we didn't like our food. I got the steak shawarma wrap, which had really dry meat. My husband tried the chicken shawarma plate, but the chicken again was very dry. We also shared some hummus but we both thought it was very bitter. I was excited it was so close, but sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"I did a search on Yelp for a gyro and this place came up. Problem is, they don't have gyros!  Parsley is WAY overpriced. It's a Mediterranean Chipotle where you wait in line and throw together your meal and then charge your more than a sit-down type restaurant.  When they ask you if you want olives, feta, etc. in your wrap or bowl they never mention that it costs extra! This should be stated and not used as a surprise up sell tactic to ambush your patrons with.  The meat was way too salty but the veggies were fresh and the wrap was decent. Their $4 fries sucked and I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's like a cafe rio for Mediterranean food except with lots of healthier options. I love it's modern decor and all of the light and healthy options that they have ! My husband and I love going here when we're looking for something delicious and healthy! The best part is that you can enjoy it guilt free :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time my husband and I have ordered from this place and looking at the ratings I was not worried about ordering at all but as soon as we got our order delivered to us through postmates and we got into our food.. I was incredibly disappointed. I first noticed we didn't get our pita bread that our bowls were supposed to come with, then I realized the extra tzatziki sauce I paid for was not in the bag and as I was eating my food I noticed the carrots I selected as a topping was not there BUT the red cabbage I didn't want was, and there was a lot of it. I was always curious about the food here but after this experience, I am definitely not going to be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We got this from Yelp, was in the area and thought we would try it. I had the chicken shawarma and my wife had the falafel salad. Both, frankly were just ok. There is no personality, very little ambience, service was satisfactory, not much character or warmth in this rather lunch line ordering, then sit down and eat establishment. With all the great places, this place won't be revisited."}
{"text":"I like mediterranean food and decided to try a new place while visiting Vegas. It was a disappointment.  Service was friendly but i did not like the food at all. Rice was really bland , no flavor whatsoever.  Same applies to the hummus. Falafel was very salty. All i tasted was salt. Salad was ok. May be their meat dishes are better i did not try them. Overall this place gave me an impression of  unauthentic  poorly made food.  I usually go to Amena Bakery and Deli when i am in Las Vegas. It is basically the same price but a lot better quality food."}
{"text":"I've never had any better Mediterranean casual dinning. What makes parsley so amazing is the super kind staff and the shawarma cooking they do with the rest of the traditional Mediterranean sides that are so free. And the Cucumber chiller is delicious, it's blended cucumber and tastes better than simple cucumber floating in the water"}
{"text":"Love the option to have either rice or quinoa in the bowl. Great layering of grains, salad, protein option, and yogurt sauce. Don't forget to add the Parsley fries with feta and parsley!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Very tiny but very cozy. I got the chicken bowl and everything is prepared right in front of you. The lady and gentleman behind the counter were exceptional! They were so friendly and asked if we needed any samples. The chicken bowl was fantastic minus the meat being a little overcooked. Their spices were to die for and their jalapeno sauce was excellent but very spicy! My dad got the steak bowl and his steak was perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  It's really close to where I live and I love Mediterranean food.  I held off on doing a review until I had tried it out multiple times.  However, after trying many items on their menu, Parsley just doesn't deliver. The ingredients don't seem fresh, the food is bland, and the overall quality is mediocre at best and sub-par at worst.  For example, every time I had their baklava it was stale.    The employees are nice and attentive.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large, but it was definitely a case of quantity over quality.  Maybe my standards for Mediterranean food are too high, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"When the competition for lunch dollars in a plaza consist of Papa John's (Better ingredients? Better than who? Taco Bell?), Wingstop (too heavy), Qdoba (aka the Fredo of fast food Tex-Mex) and Denny's (no, not drunk yet), Parsley is nothing short of a freakin goldmine.  I'm not sure people even do lunch at the Starbucks next door, but I kinda feel bad if they do.  The shawarma (chicken or beef) here is pretty good.  Shaved right off the vertical spit as I hungrily watch...on pita, in a salad, on vanilla ice cream, or simply just placed hot on my bare hand,  I'll take it any which way they'll give it to me.  I only wished they offered lamb, but can't imagine that would be a very popular order on West Tropicana and Decatur.    I do takeout every time, since lunch is usually a mob scene, and rely on Yelp's Eat24 app to place the order.  My food is ready about 70% of the time I walk through the door and if it isn't, the super friendly staff get to it as soon as possible.  There have been a couple of times where they don't receive a notification at all, but I'll notch that up to the Eat24 employees being on their rice break.      A few other things:  - I really like their spicy, pickled carrots, which can be added at no charge.  The chicken shawarma salad, tzatziki sauce and carrots all in one bite kind of tastes like an exotic buffalo wing.  No, I am currently not on drugs.   - They claim to have the best falafel in Las Vegas; I'd say it's a solid top 3 with Cleo still being my favorite.   - I've had fantasies of ripping the top off the fountain drink machine of their homemade cucumber chiller, picking it up, and drinking straight from it.  It's a very tasty and refreshing beverage.  Consistently solid!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place since im at the Starbucks next door a few times a week. Finally stopped in and it's soooo good! I always get hungry while studying at Starbucks and with my low carb diet all I can really do is their meat & cheese plate. To think I could've been coming here and getting one of their delicious salads for the same price! Omg. I had the chicken salad and couldn't decide on what dressing so she gave me a sample of each. That made the salad Bc I love sauces and options. I alternated between the 3. Great flavor! Great value. Great service."}
{"text":"Eh, the concept here isn't new..  They should rename this place \"The Mediterranean Chipotle.\" You pick your meat, then whether you want it in a bowl, salad, plate, and then there's Kabob versions of each of those too. 6 options. That's more options than at most brothels! .. So I've heard..  The good: The fries are pretty damn good. Better than most Greek places, but I'm still used to krinkle cut fries at Greek places in the Midwest. The chicken kabob was a normal kabob. Nothing amazing, but nothing boring. Just on par with most other places. The cauliflower thingy(see pic) was good, but not as good as the photo looks.  The bad: Honestly, this place is super unorganized, hence missing a star, and getting 4 in this review. My first time here, and everyone is shouting over everyone else. I couldn't hear the lady or understand her over her thick accent. After asking, \"Huh?\" LITTERALLY 7 times, I found out I have to sit and wait 12 minutes to make the chicken.. the whole time, watching over a dozen others get their steak and chicken plates before me.   All in all, this place would benefit from photos of their food on the wall or menu. I had no idea what I was ordering, and to be honest, AFTER I ordered, the steak burrito thingy looked amazing."}
{"text":"Check in to get your free dessert. Definitely my fave spot for Mediterranean food. Great service, fast, super nice spot, clean, modern, food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this place as I searched 'healthy' on Yelp. I loved that it has vegan and vegetarian options, as I have been feeling that I've been eating to much meat lately so this was a nice change. It is a grab and go which is perfect for the ones on a quick time crunch. The place is very clean and friendly. It was nice to see that after every customer, the employee would wash their hands. It gave me a sense of relief.   I ordered the falafel salad, which was made fresh. It was not soggy and you had the option of adding additional toppings for $1 extra.   The reason I ranked it 4 star is because the menu did not list the ingredients of each menu item. I had to kept asking the staff, which were helpful, but would have been nice to see it while staring at the menu."}
{"text":"I found this place a year ago and immediately fell in love with it! The service is amazing and everyone is so nice!! I love how you can see them preparing your food. I usually get the chicken wrap and it's the best thing I've ever tried! The food is full of flavor and tastes fresh! I also love how the inside looks and how it's set up! Amazing"}
{"text":"Wow! Had to say that first as I just finished visiting here for the very first time. What an awesome lunch place! Healthy clean food with great price...and friendly staffs. What more can u ask for? So glad I found this place, thx for my fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the Yelp reviews, and glad I did.  The very sweet & helpful Sheila served me.  My biggest issue was what to choose.  So many wonderful selections.  I decided (finally ) on the sampler veggie platter which gave me salad & 5 more choices, I chose the tabouli, hummus, roasted eggplant, olives & red quinoa.  A huge platter, probably intended for four, but I ate the whole thing.  It also came w/pita bread.  Total cost w/my drink $11.  Can't be beat, I'm here for 6 days and will definitely be back at least a few times. Atmosphere is modern & clean."}
{"text":"I had ordered the Steak shawarma  plate and they had forgot my tzatziki sauce so I called them up and they were happy to deliver it to me and I was happy too considering this is my first time trying out this place . Needless to say I didn't expect that extra mile service for some sauce , but was greatly appreciated since I'm not driving and couldn't go back up there and grab it also he included a baklava free of charge which was nice ."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place and I'm glad we did! The food was delicious and the portions, generous. We ordered the chicken shawarma plate, beef kabob plate, and chicken kabob bowl. We all loved our food and were so stuffed after! I recommend calling ahead if you plan to get your food to go. The kabobs take about 15-20min to cook. But overall we enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"The falafel is delicious The pita is served warm and soft The hummus is flavorful, smooth but thick texture The tahini is thick and yummy French fries are fresh and tasty The pricepoint is reasonable Customer service- A+  I can't say enough good things about the food served at this place, so happy I came across it as I have tried many local falafel places (Crazy Pita, Paymon's, Sababa, Osi's Kitchen, Zaytoon, Shawarma Vegas) and these places all have one item or the other amiss. \"Parsley\" is down to earth, and the service was so friendly! Hands down, this is our new go-to falafel joint."}
{"text":"The people behind the counter were very polite. The food here was not that great rice tasted funky meat was dry even with a ton of sauce on it. The sauce was bland."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try.  I wasn't disappointed.  Prices were good.  Food is fresh and made to order.  I was disappointed they had gyro meat but they do it as a wrap not on the pita bread.    The menu was a bit confusing for me, but asking few questions I ordered and it was good.    I say the gyro wraps, or salads are good choice.  I did their Wrap and fries my fried had salad with the gyro meat on it.  The have some nachos that look great will try next time and let you know."}
{"text":"We have been to Parsley 3 times in the last couple months each time using a groupon. All 3 times we were very happy with the food. Parsley is counter service where you have the food prepared for you from all the ingrediants behind a glass food bar.  You can have any item custom made the way you like it, which is was we like.  I love a chicken shawarma plate but I only like certain sides on the plate so this works out great.  They are a little stingy on the pita bread and they charge for every little extra you order but with the use of the groupon that is no problem.  We have started to like parsley over Daily Chicken across from UNLV on Marlyland Pky as it is cheaper and really just as good."}
{"text":"We've been to the other location several years ago, but decided to try this one since its open later and it didn't disappoint. The falafel wrap was great. The falafel was crispy, the myriad of flavors with the salad, hummus, and hot sauce made for a delicious combination. We also got the eggplant salad, which was really more of a dip/spread. It was amazing!  Meant to eat with pita, we still ate it by the forkful. Nice to know this place is as tasty as we remembered!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found my new favorite workday lunch spot! :)  The beef is so tender and flavorful and the homemade wheat pita bread isn't dry and chewy like most. I also love how they serve it with a side of pickled carrots instead of french fries."}
{"text":"I really don't get the great reviews this place is getting. It's not bad and they give you big portions for the money but we found the food bland compared to most Mediterranean places. We also thought the options for meats were very limited and they didn't even have any gyro meat. It's basically Chipotle style fast Mediterranean food, a great idea really, I'm just used to more flavorful Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Wow! In town for a visit and stumbled upon Parsley Mediterranean next to Starbucks. The food was fresh, and tasted fresh and clean - not all goopy or greasy. Portions are large. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Wish they had a location in LA. We'd definitely be regular  customers!"}
{"text":"Deeelicious.  My bf says this is one of his favorite  fast-casual restaurants in town. And you know what? I agree!  I love the inside- it's decorated well and I love the tables and chairs. Also outside seating too which is where we usually sit.   Prices are totally decent and they have a great variety. You can choose a bowl, salad, sandwich... It's chipotle style but with fresh Mediterranean style food. They have all veggies you could want, in additional to salsas, hummus, tahini, greek yogurt. The portions are really big (definitely lasts me two meals) and the flavors are so good. I usually get a bowl which is over rice and salad (similar to chipotle) but i am eager to try their sandwiches which come on a baguette and look so good. I think a large baguette sandwich is like 8.00 which isnt really much more than a footlong at Subway but with real fresh ingredients. Also I dont know how they make their pita-chips  but they're like crack. so good.  Employees are always really nice and helpful. Their soda is super carbonated and the green cucumber drink they have is so refreshing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Soooo good! We had the falafel bowls and parsley fries and there was enough for leftovers. I do wish there wasn't an extra charge for things like hummus, tabbouleh, quinoa. Clean place, friendly workers. Fast service."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh inexpensive food. I ordered the Chicken plate. more than enough food to share with another person, I also tired there steak wrap. Been here a few times and I never have been disappointed. Cheap eats, healthy and fresh. what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Was not too busy on a Sunday afternoon.  Beef sharwarma plate was good: the beef was very moist and well seasoned, rice was good, salad was fresh, The carrots were mildly spicy with a slight dill flavor.  Pistachio baklava was strangely salty  Service was great, I'll be back"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their green cucumber drink is very refreshing. I always recommend this place for friends and family that come to Vegas. Everything on their menu is super delicious! They are also very generous with their serving size. A small wrap is like a large wrap. I can't imagine how huge their large wrap is? You can't go wrong either way."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Fast, cheap, and always satisfying. Very close to the flavor back home (israel), and the owner did a great job with this \"chipotle style\" concept."}
{"text":"First impression appearance is clean and welcoming.The salad bar they have to make all the wraps, bowls, and salads is full of fresh produce. The guy who helped me not sure if he was owner or not was super helpful and explained what they offered and even gave me a sample of falafel to try before ordering it. I ended up ordering a falafel salad that contained about 9 falafel, lettuce, chick peas, marinated carrots and tomatoes plus parsley ;) The falafel was a little too crispy for my liking but still yummy. The salad dressing I think was hummus based instead of the typical oil & vinegar on a Greek salad. It wasn't my favorite so I think I'll ask for another option next time. It comes with a side of homemade pita bread that was warm and chewy. A great addition to the salad. I would recommend this place for a great lunch choice. Awesome service and for you meat eaters it looked like they had great choices for a wrap!"}
{"text":"It's always easy to pick this place for lunch because it's:  1. FAST 2. GOOD 3. WELL PRICED  If I had one con, is that I don't like to eat at the restaurant because you come out smelling like grilled food and strong spices, so typically we like to order to pick up or delivery (um, yes, they deliver...AWESOME).  Eat here, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I hate leaving revues like these...I really do Lets define the term \"modern\" ...what does that mean? Authentic?----not. Fusion? ...hmm if done properly and tastefully....but its not. So what is it? The place tries to cater to too many facets, healthy, middle eastern, vegan....and so on, at the end of the day you get food (while it might be healthy and fresh)...but flavor less, not true to the source. Tried the \"curry\".. missing some major key ingredients like lemongrass and is missing any heat what so ever. tried the Shawarma...its ok...but not spiced properly, nothing I'll ever order again....or come here again for that matter... Conclusion: if you are looking for authentic middle eastern cuisine this is not it. what is it?....I don't know. Nice place, cute, clean, well maintained, friendly stuff, awesome owner. but its not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago after my workout at the gym.   Loved their chicken bowl. I love mediterranean food and love when I can get a filling fresh meal in the city that won't make me feel guilty. I will def be back for another bowl.  Thanks to the yelp check in for the baklava.   Casual dining, indoor seating."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night and there was a steady stream of regular customers ordering to go and eating in. Upon walking in I was immediately greeted by Fernando. He was incredible! He walked me through the menu and let me taste a few of the items before I ordered. The menu had different types of bowls and plates with options for chicken, steak and falafel. Fernando recommended the falafel and the vegetarian sampler. I ended up ordering the vegetarian sampler platter with a side of chicken. Everything tasted delicious and fresh. The portions were also very generous. The big standouts to me were the hummus, the baba ganoosh, and the eggplant salad. I'll definitely be back for both the food and the customer service!"}
{"text":"I had their yellow curry last night...it was fantastic!  I had to come back today to try their chicken wrap. Freshly shaved chicken, hummus, tabloui, and all the fresh side options.....it was the best wrap I've ever had!!! Not to forget their freshly home made cucumber drink...yeah, I was very impressed to say the least!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, outstanding service and staff! As a new customer I was so satisfied with the welcoming smiles of staff and AMAZING food!! Great portions, food is so fresh and the price is fantastic! My favorite is the wheat wrap half chicken/steak! Yumm! I will be a regular customer to the this spectacular restaurant! Thanks!"}
{"text":"After eating there every second day for almost a year (part of my salad diet) I have had it. When asking for an extra scoop of chopped tomatoes on an 10$ salad I was told that \"we had to charge you more\" - the hell you haven't. To start with 11$ is expensive for a salad and you are gonna be cheap with raw veggies like chopped tomatoes and chopped cucumbers. I spend in the region of 45$ at your establishment a week. But NO MORE and you can thank your employee Ken for that. I am sure I can find other places that will serve me a salad and not be cheap with something as pedestrian as lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers    Follow up:  after their Facebook Messenger person assured me that they would be in touch not a damn thing has happened for over a month now. Apparently they REALLY DO NOT care for their customers. Now I'm definitely NEVER going back"}
{"text":"Food is good for what you pay however an appetizer and drink combo is like 8 bucks! A small order of tabouleh and a fountain drink? Say what? It seems like everything is extra even olives which is kind of weird considering the fact that it's Mediterranean I mean olives are pretty much standard right? Seems busy all the time and staff do their best to get the line moving. Juana was very nice and helpful. I'll be back"}
{"text":"TIP: Check in on Yelp for a free dessert!   I have been wanting to try this restaurant for about a year now and am so glad I did! Parsley is served \"Chipotle Style\" aka, you pick your meat (Chicken or Shawarma,) you pick your style (Wrap/Bowl/Salad) and then you build accordingly.   The line clipped along quickly for it being lunch hour; about 15 minutes from wait time to checkout and although I'm not much of a \"salad for lunch\" kinda girl, I ate about half and was perfectly full. Not only that, it was absolutely delicious! The lettuce was crisp, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the topping all looked (and tasted) fresh! I was a little hesitant to try their baklava, primarily because it often tends to be too dense and syrupy, but theirs was a great combination of flaky, sweet and crunchy.  If you have enough forethought, you can also order ahead for pick up through their app!   This is such a quick, healthy, affordable alternative dining option that I know I will be back. The fact that I could eat a filling meal for less than $10.00 (and feel good about my choice) is awesome. The fact that I could make their bowl into two meals instead of one makes me do a happy dance.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So I've been here two other times before and loved it. This time, however, was a different story all together. Maybe it was because my husband and I finally decided to buy the groupon that has been on there for weeks, but either way, our experience was less than desirable. The staff said hello pleasantly enough when we came in, but then the guy taking our order started to have a bad attitude and not listen. My husband knew exactly what he wanted, what type of meat on his wrap, etc., and ordered it that way. The guy then (nearly screaming, mind you) asked him at least three more times while making the wrap if he wanted chicken or steak. We had our kids and their friend with us also (maybe the larger group caused the bad attitude?  Not sure) and the guy did the same thing to my son a few times, as well. We got combos on the meals (majority of them) and when we got to check out, my husband presented the groupon. The girl then told us with the groupon we couldn't get the combos. We were a little confused as to why we couldn't get fries and a drink and had to ask her several times before she managed to properly explain that the combo was a 'special deal' and we could only do one deal per transaction. We told her that's fine then and to ring the fries and drinks up separately. We still wanted those regardless of price. It took quite a while to get the fries, which was fine as we ate our actual food until then, but the steak shawarma itself was actually not that great this time. It was dry and kind of crusty, and I myself had a terrible stomach ache the rest of the night like I was going to be sick. The worst part was they kept belittling another employee in there in front of us and ignoring him by speaking Spanish to each other and kept telling him to get in the back. In Spanish they'd say they didn't want him up front with them and to send him in the back. Honestly this visit really upset me because the other times I absolutely loved this place but I don't feel like I'd go back now due to this experience. Maybe it was a bad day for these guys but it definitely produced terrible service and a not so great meal."}
{"text":"Was just visiting Vegas for a week. I really appreciate that they have nice covered outdoor seating here (hard to find in the area). The inside also has small tables, larger tables, and a nice long table/barstool seating that's great for working on a laptop, etc.  I ordered the chicken shiskabob bowl, and added their new red quinoa. Over all it was all delicious. I also really enjoyed their cucumber drink, and it's pretty affordable for $2 (I was able to refill it also, not sure how much that's encouraged). The Starbucks and other place next door were $3+ for one small cup of juice, so I felt this place was a great buy. I personally had no problem with the pita bread or anything else I ate here- I'm also usually pretty picky about chicken and I thought their chicken was Excellent. I would go again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for Mediterranean food and my usual go-to spot is closed on Sundays, so I looked on Yelp and found this place. I love Mediterranean and have tried many places throughout Vegas. This is by far my least favorite.   It's a fast food joint, so don't come expecting good restaurant quality food. I ordered the falafel salad, expecting it to be like a Greek salad with falafel on top. Not even close. When I asked about different dressings (wanting a more traditional Greek style dressing) they were at a loss. And the falafel was burnt, which made the whole thing a throw away. All that and it cost me about what it would at a good Mediterranean restaurant.   I'm giving it two stars because maybe they had an off day, or I just ordered the wrong thing here (I'm hoping the meat selections fare better). I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was the best chicken curry I have ever had. In fact so good I ate it two nights in a row"}
{"text":"So went to this place because I've never been, I want stole it's good. So it's like a qudoba but not. I'm not sure what everything was but it was good. I had a salad thing with chicken and white white sauce and spicy carrots. Other things were extra one dollar. I didn't know what they were so I didn't get them. Customer service was good. The chips were great. I would go back for the chips for sure. The food was okay. I'm just not used to that kind of food???? Next time I'll try falafel instead of chicken. They closed at 9 and I couldn't even tell. We didn't feel rushed at all to leave. :) thanks guys, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great shawarma and kabobs great price if you buy a groupon.if you want your shawarma fresh come before 4pm otherwise it's still good but already dry since they don't put a lamb fat on the top to keep it moisture for the long day."}
{"text":"Think of a Chipotle but Mediterranean style type of vibe. You can pick a bowl, plate, or salad with beef, chicken or schwarma. They also add some rice and spicy pickled carrots. It comes with pita on the side. I found this to be pretty delicious and healthy especially after working out. Their prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you're getting."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! We stayed at the Tahiti Resort & had food delivered to the lobby. I had the Chicken Shawarma, Mum had the Chicken Shish Kebab salad & my sister in law had the Falafel salad. We all loved it! Everything was fresh, the serving sizes are generous, & the flavors were delicious. We loved it so much we ordered it the next day too!"}
{"text":"Bro... are you serious??? I ordered the gyro off of the vertical meat cooker that spins slowly. All i got was burnt pieces.  Like really burnt.   So  bad i only ate the bread and veggies inside. I was gonna ask for my money back before continuing to eat it but its prob gonna be a hassle to get a refund from a small business so i just left.   This place is no bueno...  no bueno at all..."}
{"text":"Parsley Modern Mediterranean is wonderful.  Very responsive staff.  Food is wonderful.  I usually get the wraps (chicken or beef are my go-tos).  Babaganoush and the warm pita bread is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Go here! Super healthy and fresh, extremely friendly service, and delicious. Literally the best hummus I've ever had. I might live in California, but I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  The nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  Actually pretty good.  The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.   The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time. I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Sit down, but has a fast food joint that satisfies.  Yes, the hot food is either on the spit or already sitting under warmers, but it's so good.  I'm not doing a good job selling this place, but you have to try it.  This tiny restaurant on Pecos, in a massive parking lot has a variety to satisfy the taste buds.  I guess you either like it or you don't.  The kebobs are not sitting out, but in it's own refrigerated section.  The skewer is a decent size and I would consider it a generous portion for the price point.    I'm totally into their chicken curry here.  It's a bowl of coconut milk, spiciness with thin strips of chicken and all the fresh parsley my bowl can hold.  The basmati rice is so fluffy, I'm glad it's all soaked in my curry sauce to make it that much more satisfying.  My husband really enjoys their chicken shawarma bowl, with some free added ingredients and some for an up charge.   Their nachos are made with fried pita bread and their seasoning for their chicken is totally on point with me.  I really enjoy their tzatziki sauce, so I don't mind throwing that into the mix of it all.  They have their own version of hot sauce, a bit too spicy for me, but a little would go a long way.    Prices are fair, but the running Groupon deal makes it that much more sweeter to try a new place.  The workers were nice, super patient and it made our visit quite pleasant on both occasions. It's a little of a trek for us, but definitely a must return restaurant for us to keep in our rotation.  They are part of the Perka app, so check-in for free appetizer and future rewards as stated on the receipt.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There are some mixed reviews, but our experience here was nothing but positive. We were greeted, they offered us choices to sample, since we appeared unsure and asked if we were first timers.  I was skeptical that they served curry, but man was it good.  A big pile of rice and a whole lot of curry for a pretty decent price.  A little bit on the spicy side, but it was satisfying.  My husband had the salad and they were heavy handed with the dressing, so try to ask for light dressing.  The meat was tender, and all the flavors were surprisingly good.    This is casual dine in area and it was packed.  So, I guess the food speaks for itself.  We just happen to be in the neighbor and it was definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish you lived closer to me :-) During our visit to LV we have come here twice. We like veggies, even when we are on vacay and this is a great spot to get food that won't leave you constipated the next day. (I'm a nurse, so I realize that these sort of conversations are hard for people, but they also reflect reality :-)  We like to feel good, even on vacation and Parsely's gives you lots options to feel good. This place is teaming with healthy, fit people (and the cute chubbies as well) because the veg is fresh and aplenty and the price is so good. We totally pigged out for $40 including tax and baklava but usually your price per person is abou $10. Our reco's: Falafel salad with their spicy red sauce. It needs the heat because it healthily does not have a lot of salt. Add some babaganoush, taziki, and hummus (usually you pay $1 extra per side unless it is automatically included) and you've got yourself quite the  Mediterranean spread. The Hummus plate is great as wel. Just the Hummus with pita chips is worth getting. Their fresh pita chips are soo good.   Don't forget the Cucumber Chiller for $1.99. The yellow curry is fabulous as well, rice is seasoned so well you could eat it by itself. Next time I'm going to get the Nachos. Yum."}
{"text":"I come here regularly & this is the first time I'm regretting spending my money here.  Koran /Karen was Giving dirty looks & took her time cleaning, flirting with the only male there & he wasn't doing to help, even though there was people waiting in line. Her attitude was nasty! She completely ignored me but not the next guest because he was a guy she was nice to him, that's so immature & unprofessional.  Melissa was rude rushed the order cause she was too busy on the delivery app, gave attitude for no reason Falafel was burnt , charged as bowl when it was an appetizer to my meal & I didn't realize until I got home.  Didn't give silverware, or napkins. Forgot pita bread, tried to rush the whole order. So disappointed in the service!"}
{"text":"Went with Groupon because I love Mediterranean food and thought it was a great way to try it out. It was wonderful! I'll go again. The prices are extremely reasonable for the very tasty food. There's a system for ordering but the guy behind the counter was patient and informative while we navigated the choices. Had beef shawarma plate and bowl. Both were fabulous I believe a wrap was the other vehicle available for the \"stuff\". Highly recommend."}
{"text":"As mention from Arthur L, one stamp each visit. Get there around 11am as this place do get busy and it is a long wait period.  I have went to Parsley for two years now and the shwarma wrap is great, either beef or chicken.  The curry is not bad bad."}
{"text":"Why do Halal Guys when you can do Parsley? The comparison is a joke. Chicken? Bomb. Falafel? Bomb.  Be sure to check Groupon for the $11 for $16 deal. And on top of that, the free Baklava per Yelp check-in? It's a steal. Grand larceny, even. Cuff me now and take me away.  *Excuse the incorrect usage of grand larceny. It was for effect, you see."}
{"text":"I've been here like 5 times already, that's how good this place is. I always get the steak plate, I pay extra for the cheese but that's ok, its worth it. The rice is on point, love everything about this food here. Thank you for the good service."}
{"text":"First time here and it was so delicious!!!! The man helping me really took his time and explained how to order. I ended up getting the half chicken half steak burrito. My first bite in, I could really taste the freshness. I also ordered pita chips which were TO DIE FOR!!! The spices and crispiness to it made it soo yummy. I checked in and actually receive two free desserts instead of just one. So I chose the normal baklava and the chocolate w nuts. Overall, great experience. The staff was really nice and caring!"}
{"text":"After our second time here, we have a much better impression. We were rushed through the line to order the first time. On the first visit, it was one of the least friendly places on our trip to Vegas. But they were redeemed the second time.   Tzatziki, hummus, pita chips, baguettes, falafel, and chicken over rice all tasted good. The beef salad with all the fixing is delicious. Make sure you use a Groupon discount, $18 for 2x$16 coupons. Then it will be worth it. Without the discount, I think it's a bit expensive with all the great food around Vegas at great prices. Let's hope it stays competitive."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews, it's not something I get off on, but I just gotta say I was expecting more... I ate everything so I can tell you it wasn't gross and I'm sure if I went in there again it might be different because everything appears to be fresh. The sauce and humus were bland and the chicken was cold and dry, and everything was covered in way too much oil... I would definitely buy the spicy carrots by the gallon though!  Best of luck to the owners and please take this as constructive criticism but I will not be a returning customer"}
{"text":"Vegans elate! Parsley offers a groovy selection of vegan Mediterranean options to satisfy your Mediterranean munchies. The falafel are absolutely divine - among the best in town. Also, the red/green sauces are delicious, especially because the red is so spicy! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The only thing I have had is the beef wrap and it's so good I don't want to try anything else."}
{"text":"I've been to Parsley on quite a few occasions since my initial visit and it just keeps getting better and better every time I eat here. I've tried quite a few of their items and everything has been delicious, but one of the main reasons I decided to update and upgrade my review of Parsley is their version of nachos.   My mom was the genius who ordered them and they are beyond amazing. Pita chips instead of chips, with tzaziki sauce, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers and parsley. I'm so glad my mom was generous enough to share! For less than $6 this dish is an absolute steal and there was plenty for two people to share as a meal. I think I was addicted after the first bite, it's that good. The rest of their menu is yummy and healthy as well and I've never had a bad meal here. I only wish they were closer for me to go more often.  Not to mention customer service is always outstanding. They are so friendly and accommodating here!"}
{"text":"I have been to Parsley on a number of occasions since this new location opened up on the west side of town.  Service is friendly and accommodating. My favorite menu items include the salads, wraps and Mediterranean nachos when I don't mind being bad.  There are often Groupons available if you are looking for a deal. They have many healthy options at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. I came here for lunch to have a healthy meal for a change and they had a great healthy menu. I ordered a chicken wrap at the regular size and it was pretty large, very healthy and super tasty. Above all, i had excellent customer service from all the staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as I love Mediterranean food.  Initially it looked very good.  I ordered a Steak Schwarma Salad and a Chicken Schwarma Wrap as I wanted to try both.  Order process was not too smooth and the employees seemed overworked, nervous and not very happy.  It was disappointing they didn't have any fresh brewed iced tea to drink.  I spent over $20 on lunch and they gave me a water glass that looked like the tiny cups the dentist gives you to spit in between drilling.  I ended up going back and forth to fill it up at the soda machine and it kept putting a little red punch drink in my water which didn't enhance the lunch experience.  My food looked great and I was happy the worker measured the meat out in a cup so they are consistent on what they give you.  Upon trying the Schwarma both were without any flavor.  I was super disappointed because the reason I love Mediterranean food so much is the bold flavors.  The lettuce was extremely disappointing as it also had no flavor.  They need to add some Vinegar, Garlic, Lemon, something to give it a dressing that takes your breath away but it was just sprayed with oil.  I had them add their spicy sauce when going through the line and I enjoyed it but without that both meats were flavorless.  The Hummus was surprisingly excellent.  The Tzatziki sauce and the Tahini sauce were also dead upon arrival.  I would give this place a 2 on food and 1 on service and friendliness so I am giving it a 2 rating."}
{"text":"happy with the first time, but the second time one worker there do my food.after i oder the food,she start to filled my plate up, then she scrap alot of my food back in the prep-food container. i see that she did it in front of my face.i feel like left-over for people that order the rice that she scrap of my plate.i was the only customer that was in there to order food.awhile making my food she also make many different food.it must been for her.she should worries about customer food first,but she didnt.i also notice on the picture wall order that is couple chicken in kids meal.awhile waiting for the chicken kids meal to be cook.after she done fried the chicken.she took one pieces chicken and put it aside.then i ask her why there is only one pieces chicken,when on the order menu wall show 2 pieces of chicken,she answer the one on the wall has two small pieces of chicken,you only get one when is big.i told her  i see her put one pieces away and on the side.she then get really agressive at me. she told me that all i get. i left the place. i think i never come back here. after for about one month, i decide to stop by and see about this place.this place was busy with may worker and i did not see her there. i order the food and left."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food! Lots of fresh options to add to your selection, including delicious marinated carrots. The tuna salad is a fresh take with olives and parsley. Adding it to the salad bowl was a filling and delicious lunch. Hummus bowl and steak bowl were popular with the guys. We will have to come back to try the other options, including the nachos!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. It's quick, easy, and delicious.   Food: It's Iike the Mediterranean version of Chipotle which is sheer genius. You can make your salad, plate (rice on the side), or bowl (rice and salad together) here. The notable things to get is beef or chicken shawarma but you can also choose wraps, shawarma and hummus, and even curry.   My favorite thing to get is the chicken shawarma plate with salad on the side and hummus for an extra $1. If you haven't tried their shawarma, now's the best time to get it. It's juicy, tender, and straight up delicious to the taste buds. You can see them shaving it off as it's slowly roasted which gives it a nice touch. Pair it with hummus, and I can't think of any other way to heighten the flavors.   I'be also tried the curry but I wasn't a fan of it. Nothing notable about the flavor but the saltiness of it. Which reminds me, is their authentic curry in Mediterranean food? I don't think so, but correct me if I'm wrong.   Service: I'm not a fan, honestly. They never smile, and they always look stressed out. If you can look passed the service, I think you could enjoy the food, but for the most part, think fast food service. They're probably want you out of their face ASAP.   Overall, I would come back. It's delicious, fast, and probably a healthy option under a few circumstances."}
