{"text":"Coffee;  The most necessary of all evils...  I'm not saying they have the best coffee in town, cause they don't. BUT it is all you can drink. So if it's 6:00 am and you feel like death and your breath smells like something out of the depths of Mordor, you'll appreciate your mug constantly being topped off.   This is a real deli. There are booths only, (great for soothing last nights debauchery).  The menu is vast and inexpensive, and the food is decent and plentiful.   The waitresses are old school and have been seeing the same crowd for a long time. They'll remember you, chat with you and even bring you toast with a sparkly candle on your birthday.    Refill please...  Fuggedabout'it!"}
{"text":"Great place, good service as always...Highly recommended , a great choice menu! Easy , quick and tasty. My recommendation for comfort food the best in area, one of the reasons they have been there for 36 years!  Johnny Angelo and Tony the owners, great people..."}
{"text":"Can't visit Montreal without having a smoked meat sandwich, and Restaurant Plaza McGill has a very good one. Fries taste homemade, coleslaw was amazing."}
{"text":"Very affordable diner. Great offering and fresh. Waitress was fantastic and extremely welcoming. Offered insight on locale attractions this place is frequented by locals."}
{"text":"This place is one of the old Greek dinners in Montreal. I love it. Food is fantastic. If you're a tourist and want to experience what a real Montreal resto is. You've come to the right place.  The prices are fantastic compared to the area"}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for a quick lunch. the menu seemed to have lots of choice and the prices were okay.  On the corner of Notre-Dame Ouest and McGill, this little 'deli-grill', as they call themselves, is packed only with booths.  The service was very quick! I was pleasantly surprised. I guess they really specialize in the lunch crowd, because i took my sweet time eating and sipping my tea, and i was still in and out of there in 40 mins. tops! I got there just before noon to find maybe 5 or 6 other booths occupied. Before i knew it every booth in the place was taken.  I started with a French Onion soup. Really, i could eat french onion soup every damn day, i love it so much. This soup was good. Nice and cheesy. But nothing to rave about. Just good soup. Next a had a small poutine. Sad to say, i was disappointed.  I think the gravy was chicken gravy, it had that slightly runny and peppered taste to it. Not as good as delicious beef gravy. Here's the kicker, the cheese was just regular old mozzarella! *Gasp!* No cheese curds?! Montrealers should know better. I want my squeeky cheese poutine! Ah well, i ate maybe half of it.  I would come back again to try something else. They have a huge selection of hot or cold sandwiches, as well as greek, italian and steaks and burgers too."}
{"text":"A very traditional American diner, and everything else you wouldn't find in the US.  My colleagues and I meet twice a week for breakfast. The wait staff is friendly and makes sure your white coffee mug is always full of coffee.  If you love pancakes definitely order them.  Other favorites are french toast, a breakfast sandwich with fried egg, lettuce, bacon and processed cheese.  We ask for it on a dry wheat toast and no mayo."}
{"text":"this is by far the best restaurant not only in old montreal but all of montreal...owners (3 brothers) are very friendly, food is always delicious with great atmosphere...Restaurant Plaza Mcgill reinforces the notion that montreal is truly a unique and outstanding place"}
{"text":"The sausage is too salty. The cheese in smoked meat isnt melted. The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"We went down from Notre Dame and we were so hungry from all the walking around so we opted for a nice meal. We saw this place at the corner of McGill street and it caught my eye. When we went in, we were greeted nicely.  (Nice staff and I love seeing their smiles) We ordered Hawaiian Pizza with 16 pcs Chicken Wings. There were four of us and they nicely served the pizza into  four plates of 2 slices of pizza. My family is a huge pizza eater and they've been to every pizza place - you name it. Plaza McGill topped it as per their review. Personally, one of the best pizza I have ever tried. The side (coleslaw) that was served along with the chicken wings is very flavourful and by far one of the best i've had. The fries is fresh outta fryer . I honestly recommend this place if you happen to come around the area."}
{"text":"Filthy ugly place. Terrible service. Bad quality food, badly prepared.   Rips in upholstery everywhere. Carpets worn through and absolutely grimy. Most hard surfaces are sticky with dirt. My burger (pretty much the most standard easy item that can be ordered in a diner) was served very well done. I had ordered it medium rare. However, considering the quality of the meat I think perhaps they burnt it for safety.   The grossest part of the experience was watching the waitress openly stuffing her mouth with leftover food from plates right at the tables, just as soon as customers walked out. I witnessed this several times. Once in fact when I signaled for the check and her mouth was so full she could not respond. So she pointed at her mouth and gave me a thumbs up, I guess implying \"My mouth is full of table scraps so I cannot speak at this moment. However, I recognize that you've stopped consuming your disgusting burger and are requesting the check. This actually works out well because I noticed you only managed to get halfway through that burger and I'm still hungry. So I'll hurry and get your bill if you could go ahead and get going just as quickly as you can. Thanks! Hope to see you again soon!\""}
{"text":"Four stars because this is a classic diner experience. If you like comfy booth dining, ambience is everything. Food is ok!!"}
{"text":"Used to go there all the time when I worked in the area, it was a decent joint for what it served but now years later, it was horrible. Burger felt like it was twice cooked and basically a hockey puck, fries tasted like canola oil.  Anywho I dot recommend it to anyone but the starving and I ain't never going back."}
{"text":"Une devanture peut attirante vue de l'extérieur mais accueillant à l'intérieur. Nourriture à mon gout classique pour un brunch. Assiette très copieuse et service attentif."}
{"text":"This place is all around mediocre.  It feels quite dated and the menu is quite scattered. The food was okay, but the presentation could be better.  My biggest complaint is the service which could be a bit nicer. Over the few times I've been here, I've noticed the staff can be quite impatient with you.  I wouldn't go here again by choice, but if you need to eat in this area and are out of choices, it's not the end of the world to have a meal here."}
{"text":"Beacoup de place à l'interieur et meme en arriere; bouffe rapide, frites, pizza, burger, pasta, salade grecque, etc."}
{"text":"I came back here a second time, I was working in the area and wanted quick cheap food. I tried the souvlaki this time and what a difference. The burger I took the first time was really bad but the chicken souvlaki tasted better then some other Greek restaurant I have been to. This time their fries were all right, I'm glad I happen to give this place a second chance, just stay away from the burger. Give this place a try if you don't have a good budget."}
