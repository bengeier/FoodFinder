{"text":"I visit the grange when I want some cheap but filling food.

I just saw that the Curry Kitchen had recently opened (it used to be an extremely overpriced Greek place), so I decided to try their spiciest curry, which they said was the beef curry for $6.99.

It came in one of the usual take-out boxes, half filled with salad and half with rice + curry.

It was not what I expected, tasting like Chinese style curry (mild & non-spicy) as opposed to Indian style curry (rich, thick, spicy curry).  I did not taste any spiciness at all.  It wasn't bad by any means, but I can't say it was good.

Overall, I would say 2 Stars because the price point is high for the amount of food.

Compared to the other Curry places close by:
- Yueh Tung (2 blocks away) has a beef or chicken curry for $6.50, with 3x the amount of meat/rice.
- Quality is the same as Indian Biriyani House, at a slightly higher price point.
- Amaya Express (Urban Eatery @ Eaton Centre) is also much better, but slightly pricier at around $10.
- For authentic spicy Indian curry, go to Matagali Restaurant (but be aware price is essentially doubled at the $12 price point)"}

Ok so the samosas are good and cheap. I will probably be back for those! If I only had samosas, I'd give 4 stars. Partially because you don't need a fork to eat them. 

But I ordered the Daal combo with curry, a samosa, rice, salad and a pop. And I didn't get a fork, or any napkins. Also, I wasn't given any salad. When I went back to acquire these lacking things, I was told I didn't pay for them. Ugh. 

When my meal was finally up to standard, and I was granted cutlery to consume it, I was under-impressed. The curry has a weird aftertaste, the rice was cooked with too much water and is falling apart, and the salad had a base of parsley. 

I had high hopes for this place, but since it's one of the only grange standards that is open on Sunday I'm sure it will do well. Just needs some fine-tuning."}
{"text":"- I love this place! I always get a beef curry and salad- the flavors are really nice, the staff are really friendly, and they have a 13% student discount- so my meal comes to 8$ with a salad. One of my faves in the Grange :)"}
