{"text":"Mushroom Swiss burger was cold, dry and slapped together with no effort to look appetizing. Sad excuse for a sandwich. My wife got a fish sandwich that was topped with bagged salad mix lettuce bits and pieces not to mention a 1/4 of a teaspoon of tartar sauce smeared completely offcenter  by the edge of the fish patty. Management needs to start managing the quality before customers start to take their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although the place looks nice and up to date...the service has been horrible these last two years. Every time I go though the drive through, they ask you to park and they will bring it out..they'll ask everyone in drive through to do this and then the parking lot is a hot mess. I don't understand it...makes no sense. A few times I waited 15+ mins for them to come outside."}
{"text":"Another try, another fail. I guess ordering a double cheeseburger with only ketchup means holding the cheese, too."}
{"text":"Some people wind down with drinks, I choose ice cream. It's Friday, I'm done with work, in the area, and really wanted a Snickers Blizzard. 

Service is quick, the staff is friendly, and the bathroom is clean. There is also a drive thru.  Prices are reasonable. There is a lot to choose from on the menu, not just dessert. The Grill & Chill offers burgers and fries, etc.   Plenty of parking. 

It can be a real challenge trying to make a left hand turn out of their lot, so just go right and turn around somewhere else."}
{"text":"I expect a long wait at drive-thru but I am usually satisfied with their product.  Tonight I arrived slightly before 9:00 pm (closing 9:30).  Drive thru looked crowded and cramped. I went inside to order - very busy inside too.  I went back out to get in drive thru because it seemed to be less crowded.  Got to the order point at 9:08 and was told that the grill was closed.  Now I was stuck behind 3 cars and blocked in by 2 cars behind me lol.  Super fun wait for nothing.  Go here but not when it is busy or if you are in a hurry!!"}
{"text":"This ownership @ this location makes regular updates to keep things new and interesting.  They do a nice job here of appropriately updating things for the public.


PROS:
it's ice cream!
Blizzards, FTW!
they sell food at this location
drive through for ice cream and food
private parking lot
very clean!!!
Restrooms are also clean

CONS:
Blizzards seem to be short on \"stuff\".
Even when you order \"extra stuff\" in a blizzard, its still pretty skimpy.


My FAVES:  
Vanilla Moo-latte
Cookie Dough Blizzard (w/extra stuff PLEASE!)   :)
Chicken finger basket
(and, crazy--i know--but i swear they have the best rootbeer here!  LOL)"}
{"text":"Service is quick. Food was good as it can be for fast food. I absolutely will go here again because DQ is awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect. The ice cream is okay. Their blizzards are pretty good. The staff is usually mostly friendly but not always. The actual food is disgusting. I got the chicken and fries and it tasted absolutely gross. The ice cream cakes are the best that you can really get from there, I get them all the time for birthdays and they are pretty good. The lines are usually short, and when they aren't, they die down quick. Good place for a quick cone."}
{"text":"Don't try to use the new mobile deals on the DQ app that is being promoted and advertised. This location does not participate even though the app says they do and when you search for locations that do mobile deals they show up. Very misleading. Should be simple for the location to tell corporate they don't want to participate but maybe they are hoping to lure customers in with deal and hope they still buy something since they are already there"}
