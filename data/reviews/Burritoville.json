{"text":"Delicious and healthy, with good music, art, and feel-
A little bit pricey, but definitely a worthwhile meal!
The sweet potato burrito paired with quinoa salad
filled me up, made me feel great, and pleased my palate."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place (a large old house). I had a great burrito, which was HUGE and was a good price. It was slightly too spicy for me, so I'd order it a bit milder next time. The sweet potato was interesting, but I might try something else instead next time. I love that any of the menu options can be made vegan.

Service was friendly and laid back, and fluent in English."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  The food is filling, fairly priced, and just the perfect thing for this vegetarian mom, and equally vegetarian 18 year old son.  He had the burrito, and loved the flavor and texture, I had the spinach quesada, and was equally impressed.  The chips are off the hook!  The staff is friendly, and informative.  The place is comfortable.  We were disappointed that after eating one meal, that they were closing that day, and did not reopen until after we left.  Just so thankful to have had the chance to try it.  I would not miss this food pleasure, even if you do eat meat."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian place in Montreal. The selection is limited but the quality is great and most of the food is organic. 
The restaurant is placed in an old house which gives it a real authentic feel. 
Service was great, and friendly."}
{"text":"Place is in a good location for students who want to pickup some nice fast food.

However, I wouldn't really call what this place gives out \"Burritos\".  It is more like a fancy wrap.  The taste was good, even for a vegetarian option.  But I've had a lot of Burrito's.  I've been nicknamed the Burrito connoisseur of London.  I've been to a lot of places to try their Burrito's.  But this place was average.  Especially for the price.  

They take interac, sure.  But they don't mention until you get to the cash it's an extra $0.25.  Not bothered about, but give a heads up before getting to the cash.  It's only polite.

The Burrito itself was pretty small.  I don't eat a lot but I could of done with a bit more food from my \"$7.50\" Burrito.  Just because it's organic doesn't mean you have to skimp on serving size.  

The way the Burrito was wrapped didn't help much.  Getting half way through meant the bottom end of the wrap was soggy from all the juices from the innards.  Which meant as you got closer to finishing, you had to be careful the whole thing didn't fall out.  Which it did.  And made a nice big mess on my wrapper luckily so none was wasted.  But it would be a first time I would need cutlery for a Burrito. 

Overall, food tasted good but there just wasn't enough of it to justify the price IMO.  More options are needed on the menu too.  You can't call yourself Burritoville and only have three Burrito's to choose from.  That's just silly.

It's worth checking out once, but that is probably it."}
{"text":"Impressive flavorful tortilla chips and supple corn tortillas. Delicious fillings with guacamole or sweet potatoes in place of cheese at no extra cost. Options for brown rice and whole wheat burrito wraps, which are always good. Odd credit card and debit card policies though - have cash to be safe. Also, zero air conditioning. I loved my food and the laid back atmosphere, but it wasn't just the salsa that was hot. I'll come back - in the fall!"}
{"text":"Oh Burritoville, where do I start with thee...

When I first walked in here, I was expecting a real tacky Mexican place with sombreros and the whole shabang. Boy, was I wrong...

If you wanna have a good laugh ( or maybe not) on a Monday night, come here. This may sound pretty harsh but I just can't resist spending my Monday night giggling at the sight of moaning hipsters successively pouring their hearts out at the weekly open mic. The combination of overly emotional acoustic covers with bland, mediocre-at best , vegetarian Mexican food  truly makes this place one of a kind. I will never forget the jokes cracked and the flavour that always lacked.

All in all, this place is pretty overpriced for a bunch of bland beans in a whole wheat tortilla."}
{"text":"NO NO NO NO NO. So much no.
This place is a social justice warrior hippy heaven. All of the employees smell like BO (no deodorant), have long armpit hair that they flaunt everywhere, are sloppy and wear no bras. There are like 6 tables. The space is FILTHY. The employees don't even bother cleaning off the tables for you, we had to eat our meal accompanied by other people's plates and glasses. When you go out to eat, you expect some sort of lovely presentation, the food you get is adequate but looks like something you can make at home. It tasted ok but to be honest it looked like slop. Again, almost zero service from the \"employees\", you have to put in your own order at the counter then they bring it to you and that's it. I also hope you like filling up your own water and not getting any cutlery. Horrible place"}
{"text":"One of my go-to-places if I'm hungry and downtown. Warm and cozy atmosphere, nice staff, and great prices (with taxes in)...also a great place for carnivores like me to take vegetarian friends without feeling all \"ug, vegetarian food\"

Fave meal: sweet potato burrito, chipotle chips and rasberry lemonade. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I took my non-vegetarian husband here and we were both very happy with the food!  I had two sweet potato tacos which were really delicious.  I ordered the trio which comes with a choice of a side so I chose guacamole.  It was very good but I felt it needed salt.  The trio also comes with a drink so I got (because of glowing reviews on yelp) the raspberry lemonade.  It was fresh, not too sweet and totally refreshing.  I liked the atmosphere of the place too, you feel like you're in someone's home."}
{"text":"I have been to Burritoville countless times to try different items off their menu, and the food and service are consistently excellent.

First of all, the place has a nice atmosphere and you'll feel comfortable even when it is packed. The staff is agreeable and the wait-time for food is quite short. The food itself is always full of flavours, filling, and not expensive at all - really worth the price."}
{"text":"I stopped by for some late lunch,  so the place only had about 4 other clients in it. I am a friendly person, so I strode in and with a big smile, saying \"Bonjour! Hello!\" The girl behind the counter could barely take her eyes off her phone. I told her that I am allergic to gluten, and asked if the tacos were corn or flour. She responded (still barely looking up from what she was doing) and then I ordered a bowl. I then asked her if it had cilantro in it, to which she asked me if I was allergic to that too, but with a nasty look on her face (I realize I sound ridiculous in this scenario, but how do you write a review about someone's tone without sounding like a spoiled brat?;) I said no, not allergic, but I don't like it and I would rather not have it, so she then begrudgingly went to ask the chef. I was so put off, that I changed my mind right there and left. This part is so obvious, but it's what prompted me to write this review. I've worked in customer service and interaction with the clientele is a huge part of your business. A smile, a nice warm welcome, enthusiastic, or at the least helpful, staff is the bare minimum in my book.  I realize she might have been having a bad day, but I had too, my beloved mother had just passed away suddenly 4 days prior.  As she would say, (with her delightful British accent) \"Socks up girl!\""}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, by any means.  However, at work one day one of my vegetarian friends suggested we go to Burrritoville because he claimed it was really good even though its meatless.  So a bunch of us decided to go and try it out.

The place is an old style Victorian building (my favorite architecturally) with cool wooden floors.  Definitely gives it a unique vibe.  

I got the trio which has a burrito, a choice of sides (chips and salsa, guacamole, etc.) and an organic beverage.  I chose the sweet potato burrito with a side of chips and spicy salsa and a ginger ale.  

As I first bit into the hot burrito, I was thinking to myself, I don't think I can be full with just a vegetarian burrito.  But wow it was tasty.  It was very flavorful and the sweet potatoes added a whole new dimension to the burrito.  

The chips and salsa were really good as well.  As for the price 13 dollars is not too bad for the quality of food you receive.

My only complaint was that I needed to order more to be completely full."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place with a small, creative vegetarian menu. I tried the sweet potato burrito and I loved every bit of it. The place is in an old row house, so there are a variety of rooms and places inside in which to dine. Absolutely worth a stop if you're in the area and want a tasty, inexpensive, non-chain meal. There didn't seem to be AC, though, so on this hot day I took my food to go."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! And I am a BIG meat-eater, and so I didn't really have the highest of expectations going into this, but was totally blown away by how fresh and delicious everything was! The spicy salsa was my favorite, and I got the roasted veggie quesadilla and it was packed with flavor. Will def be going back for lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Mexican Food, it was just fantastic.  Relaxed atmosphere, friendly service.  Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"The architecture for food at this place is really wonderful: lots of sides, lots of ways to increase the presence of heat or vegetable in your taco/burrito/quesadilla, great liquids and decent dessert.  The food politics is great (sustainable, as organic and local as possible) too, which makes the healthiness and the really good flavor wash down well. Nice, casual staff.  great for vegans too."}
{"text":"Leur spécial du midi vaut vraiment le détour. Pour 10$ un trio qui rassasie son homme ... Difficile de trouver mieux ! Je vais toujours pour un tacos patate douce, un mix des salades du jour et leur limonade de framboises ... Je ne l'ai jamais regretté ! Et les gars qui y travaillent sont la gentillesse même !"}
{"text":"Quaint studenty kind of place. Good for a quick sort of healthy lunch. Vegetarian. Considering the other quick dining options in the neighbourhood (Subway, Quiznos, McD's, pizza slice joints), it's tough to beat.

Expect to spend $10 on lunch."}
{"text":"Not just a restaurant, this is a visit to another dimension set in an creaky three-story Victorian. Part comfortable hangout, part gallery/jam space/lending library, with scrumptious healthy Mexicanish food like something that might be served up by your veg roomate in Santa Cruz.

Loved the sweet potatoes in my taco, guac was fresh, and they serve a delicious cider.

{"text":"I found this place on Yelp, and went there late at closing one night. Wow! Although I don't like sweet stuff usually, and I find sweet potato sometimes overpowering, their \"sweet potato burrito\" ($9) is... something just spectacular, and not at all too sweet.

I wouldn't be surprised if this were picked up by a bougie place and sold as a chic appetizer for twice the price, at some point down the road, the mix of flavors and textures is really spectacular.

So I went back, and again, and again, and again. And although I hate ten of those sweet potato burritos in a four day period, I never grew tired of them.

I tasted the other burritos, and they are definitely good, but less Earth-shattering in comparison. Same thing for the sides - I thought the salsa with chips was just okay. The only other one of their offerings that I found truly amazing was the home-made lemonade ($3), particularly the raspberry one.

And that's for the food, now a quick word about the place itself: it's lovely, quiet, the philosophy is healthy (vegetarian, sustainable, humane, etc.), and the staff is just delightful.

If I weren't just visiting, this would one of my regular watering holes. If you like tacos/burritos at all, you really should definitely try it out."}
{"text":"I started going to Burritoville when I lived in NDG many years ago, they were located on Sherbrooke at the corner of Regent at the time. I've since moved downtown and lost track of Burritoville. Luckily, they moved downtown too and I recently rediscovered them at their 'new' location.

They've got a  great all vegetarian all Mexican menu and is they are the only place in Montreal that I've found where you can get a Burrito the size of your forearm. 

Great food at a great prices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Burritoville isn't just a restaurant, it's a family experience. 

Granted, I've been going there for years, ever since it was a tiny hole-in-the-wall place in NDG so I know the folks and it feels good to be there and to touch base with the owners about what they're up to, what I'm up to, what our summer plans are and what movies we're going to go see a Fantasia, but even if I didn't know them, I'd still love it. 

The thing I appreciate about Bville is that its vegetarian and organic but they don't frontload it. Burritoville doesn't purport to provide a spiritual experience - it's an awesome restaurant where you can get some nutritious food, have a beer and check out some activities spread out over three floors where the first is ideal for laptop sessions, where you can see shows in the evening on the 2nd floor (there's also a small art gallery space) or chilax on the third floor where they've set up a small, but well stoked library. 

Fave food: Spicey pinto burrito trio. I ask for a guacamole substitution on the cheese since I'm vegan - no problem (in fact there's a lot of vegan options - from soups to salads to many of the other dishes that work just fine without cheese). The burrito is large and can be a meal on its own and is filled with pre-soaked cooked organic pinto beans, a spicy tomato salsa, guacamolo and organic brown rice. The trio feels like a dinner experience. As part of it, I'd have the sprout salad (two kinds of sprouts, topped with roasted pumpkin seeds and a delish garlic dressing, and a full basket of corn chips with spicey salsa (the green tomatillo is quite good too). They've got some great home-made lemonade (either lemon or raspberry) and cookies (with vegan options). 

Beyond that though, I like to know that Burritoville's thinking about their impact. Over the last while, I've seen them engage in discussions about how to minimize their energy use, how to best support local producers, how to connect with students and faculty at Concordia in making use of the space...

It's a place that I feel great about supporting - it's a yummy, vibrant and fun place to be in."}
{"text":"Tell me first this place is vegetarian. And also est time to wait is 15-20 min. 

Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito I've had in years - the sweet potatoes one. Unusual combination that totally works! 

Took their raspberry lemonade with it which was yummy too and a guacamole, which could have done with more salt & spices.

Cute little place with friendly staff! 

No AC so can get very hot on a sunny Summer day."}
{"text":"been here twice now and i love it! the first time, i had just two sides of grilled veggies and a vegan cookie; today i had the sweet potato quesadilla sans fromage. it was magnificent. friendly staff, relaxed ambience, great prices. i'll be back."}
{"text":"Great find! I came in for a lunch on a weekday. The place was pretty empty, maybe 3 or 4 tables were full. Service was fast - you order at a counter and they bring your order to you. I got the sweet potato burrito, which was a good size and very delicious. It was $9 incl. tax and you can substitute the cheese for guacamole or extra sweet potato for no charge if you want! 

The place is really nice. Fun and cozy atmosphere. Fairly priced lunch spot to catch up with a friend, but priced a little too high to justify coming alone just to grab a bite to eat for myself."}
{"text":"Outstanding. A friend convinced us to give this place a try last night and we were all extremely satisfied. I had \"Le pinto epice\" burrito with the quinoa salad to make it a combo... Unreal. Whether you're vegetarian or not (I'm not) you will not be disappointed! Great food, excellent service, good vibe, and we even had live music - also awesome, we stuck around to listen. 

Burritos, quesadillas and more, this place might just turn me veg!"}
{"text":"VEGAN ALERT! if you go in looking for a good beef burrito you might be in for a surprise! this place is 100% vegan so no meat guys! but surprisingly the burritos are quite good and may make you rethink your meat eating habits! very authentic place, has a nice vibe. If you're looking to dive into vegan food I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wandered in here the other day.  We were the first people in at around 1:00 PM and caught them off guard.  They had just started up from some renovation.  They got bought out by the university across the way and are a co-op, which is pretty cool with me.

When it says \"vegetarian\", that's not an option, folks.  You're eating vegetarian (not vegan) when you come here.  The only thing they could make for us at the time was 3 of the 4 quesadillas, so we tried 2 different kinds, the mild salsa, and the guacamole.  Mild salsa appeared to be made with canned tomatoes but was still good. Guac was good, tasted like my homemade, except I would have added more salt. Still delicious.

Kids had the Classique Quesadilla, cheese and rice.  The boy would have liked a burrito with pintos, but no beans that day (at the time). Wife and I had Spinach/Mushroom/Rice Quesadillas.  They were solid.

Took a bit of time to get those, but I can't fault 'em because I think they were just trying to get things started up after being gone a while. Worthwhile, and close to the Musée des Beaux Arts."}
{"text":"I thought today would be a good day to take a break from all the horse, beef and pork carnage I've been indulging in lately.  And Burritoville provided exactly what I was looking for.  The sweet potato burrito was very good and I actually didn't miss the fact that there wasn't a half pound of charred animal in it (though upon reflection, man some carnitas would have really put it over the top.).  :)  

Ok, back to my meat rampage."}
{"text":"As  vegetarian this was a great find. It's downtown and easy to find. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and to do some homework on my 5 hour break one day. I ordered the Chili taco and the raspberry lemonade. The waitress told me that the chili taco was the least spicy of the taco options and man I am a pansy. I found it incredibly spicy and had to take breaks from eating it. It was very tasty and I would like to try different things here but I'm not sure I am able to if I could barely eat the least spicy thing there :( The lemonade was very yummy but full of seeds on the bottom that I wish they would strain out because it is hard to drink at the bottom. However, the building was a good place to do my homework after the lunch crowd moved out, it was very quiet and I didn't feel pressured to leave. Maybe one day I will build up my spicy tolerance and come back... I just wish they had less spicy options."}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place.  The lady behind the counter wasn't that friendly and the service was sloooowwwww.

The food was fine."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about this place.  In autumn 2009, I walked in here one day during a break from my classes at Concordia.  I asked the clerk what was good and he gave me some suggestions.  I tried the sweet potato burrito and it was delicious.  So delicious that that autumn I went to Burritoville two or three times a week and tried everything on their menu.  

After having been there for about a month, one of the clerks (who had learned my order by heart and knew where I liked to sit) called me over to talk to him.  He said, \"Let me show you something real quick.\"  He walked me to the upstairs area and to the stereo.  He showed me how the stereo worked and told me that I could choose any cd I wanted to and play it whenever I liked (save when a band was playing of course).  He also told me I could play the piano whenever I wanted.  \"If anyone has any problem with you playing the piano or with your taste in music, come find me and I'll fix the problem,\" he said.  \"Treat this like your stereo and play what you like.\"

Needless to say, this is the best customer service I have ever received at any establishment.  It doesn't hurt that the food is nothing short of amazing.  It's usually quiet enough in there to get some decent studying done but still lively enough to have a good time chatting and laughing with your buddies.  They host live shows as well, though I haven't gone to one yet.

I don't go there as often anymore (after all, I can't eat ONLY Mexican food), but this place will always have a special place in my heart.

P.S.  You haven't lived until you've tried their sweet potato burrito with guac with a side of their incredible salsa."}
{"text":"The food is good! For vegetarian Mexican food, I didn't have any expectations. I knew this place was close to Concordia but never thought to check it out.

I only got a snack because I wasn't feeling in the mood for a big mean. The Nachos were good and the Guacamole was fresh. I had a fun time. I think they should add more choices though. I don't really like sweet potatoes and most of their items are spicy. Other than that, I would go again.

I like the placement and the staff is nice. It's definitely somewhere I would bring my friends to."}
{"text":"I had a 2 for 1 voucher from The Green Conscious Guide (which is fantastic, btw), and having read the reviews here it was really a no brainer to try Burritoville out. 

The service is really friendly, laidback, and generally awesome. 

The food is flavourful, filling, and delicious. I opted for a sweet potato burrito with a side of quinoa salad. The sweet potato was perfectly flavoured and made for a satisfying burrito that didn't leave me feeling yucky, just pleasantly full. The salad was very fresh, but I personally like to add a bit more flavour to quinoa since it can be quite plain on its own. But I enjoyed it, nonetheless. 

All in all, this restaurant is a winner. Casual atmosphere, tasty and healthy food, and prices that won't break the bank. Oh, and be sure to try the raspberry lemonade! It's super yum."}
{"text":"I love going to this place. It's in an old wooden house and it exudes this great relaxed vibe. I could imagine poets and artists hanging out here.
The food matches the environment. It's all local (or as local as it can be) and fair-trade. I think it's also vegan friendly.
Their meals are pretty decent size and if you grab a trio, you should be full for a while. You're wallet will also stay full. If memory serves, you can get a delicious burrito and two sides (quinoa, soup, chips,salad, whatever!) for 12.50$! That means that for 15$, you can have a delicious fresh great meal and have enough left over for a tip!
There are no traditional waiters, so you need to order at a counter and you can grab your utensils and water yourself, but they'll bring your meal over.
It may be because it's getting late-ish, but thinking about this place is getting me hungry!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly place, very local 'student-y' - reminds me of a student-run business. Fresh ingredients, simple menu and set-up. 

The food is good, you get what you order, no surprises. I found the soft taco shells to be really delicious, wish I could make them that good. The taco filling itself was alright, I did both an original (sweet potato and black bean and one of the others (pinto beans and rice I think). Nothing spectacular, could have used more fresh ingredients like more coriander, more tomatoes.
Had chips and salsa on the side, chips were great. Unfortunately they were out of guacamole which made me sad!!

Overall nicely run business, always happy to give my money to a small place like this :)"}
{"text":"I was sure this was going to be a subway-like burrito conveyer belt when I heard the name. Could not have been further off the mark. These guys are dishing out vegetarian and vegan tacos, burritos etc. made with love and full of delicious flavours. All wholefood and fresh ingredients too. Who said mexican had to be guilty?"}
{"text":"Hey, you Buritoville - that's right - you! I've been initiated and I gotta tell you, \"me likey you long time.\"

Head up the outside stairs, and into the back of this creaky, wooden house. Then, place your order: single, combo or triple. Say what? The combo for $10 features 2 tacos of your choice. My two were the cheesy original and the sweet potato. Plus a side. My side choice? Guacamole of course. 

The brilliant part - it's all vegetarian. And while I may like land animals, I didn't notice the meatlessness. In fact, I was sufficiently stuffed. And, for all you vegans out there, the staff here are rock stars at veganizing any meal. 

Plus adult bevvies, FTW!"}
{"text":"After a few hours at the Museum of Fine Arts checking out the amazing Jean Paul Gautier exhibit (go there ASAP while it's still around!) 
Menu looked healthy so we trodded upstairs and ordered 2 chili burritos with chips and salsa and 2 local beers. The burritos came out piping hot and fresh clearly grilled and stuffed with brown basmati rice, fresh tomatoes, spiced beans and cheese. Before I knew it I had devoured the entire thing in 2 minutes lol. I should mention this is a vegetarian place (i love meat but the burrito was so good I didn't mind the least)
Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Yum!! I've only eaten the quesadilla with cheese and guacamole, etc.. in it, to which I cannot remember the name. Because it's so delicious I can't go there without getting it or trying something else, lol. Chill atmosphere and vibe.. friendly staff.. and yummy food! Slightly pricey but worth the occasional visit. :)"}
{"text":"I was unaware that this was a vegetarian place but nonetheless took a shot at the \"spicy pinto\" burrito. I didn't take a combo/trio and I didn't take a drink either. Maybe I should have just to cut the heaviness of the burrito. I feel like it lacked freshness. The beans and cheese on one side of the burrito, vegetables on the other side and a whole bunch of rice in the middle... And yet the only side I found myself eating was the vegetable side because I found the beans/cheese/rice mix to be too heavy and dry. I wish it would have had more salsa or some guacamole. A positive is that it was actually spicy, which I enjoyed. Oddly enough I came on a weekday around 7pm and it was crowded with vegetarian hipsters drinking beer and eating chips/salsa that was on a random table. Lack of variety too. Lots of drinks, lots of sides... But only 3-4 kinds of burritos. *Shrugs* Not for me."}
{"text":"Well . Food was ok . But service was non existent, communication was weird even tho I speak French and English , They had no interest in serving people . Some places are friendly and some aren't ! 
This one is not."}
{"text":"Beautiful 19thC building with lovely wood, high ceilings, warm colours, yummy cheap vegetarian and vegan food. Order form the counter in the back and they'll bring it all out for you - I like the sweet potato taco trio with chips, salsa, guacamole and a McAuslan oatmeal stout, personally. The service can be a little slow but the staff are so friendly and community oriented it's never bothered me to chill in line at the counter and chat with them while I wait. There is free wifi but it's been super spotty in my experience. This is a Concordia haven so don't be surprised by the young crowd or the oh so earnest student art on the walls."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few times to grab a bite on the go or stay awhile to study. Their burritos are fantastic. They're simple in ingredients but packed with flavour. 

The place itself is ideally located across from Concordia's hall campus, and surprisingly enough, I've never been there and had trouble finding a seat. This place deserves to be busier."}
{"text":"When someone first told me about this great \"vegetarian mexican\" joint, i thought they had eaten the worm in the tequila bottle. How can mexican food be good without it dripping with meat ?
I'll tell you how. 
Roasted effing vegetables, black beans, sweet potato wrapped in a warm tortilla served with fresh salsa. This thing could keep me vegetarian forever. I forget all about anything else i've ever eaten when i'm in the middle of this thing.

For less than $8.00 you get a full, fresh, made-to-order meal that is walk-friendly and flavourful.

A must!"}
{"text":"Burritoville, c'est une ancienne maison de style victorien avec ses planchers de bois qui craquent, ses moulures et son grand escalier qui nous emmène au deuxième étage.
C'est une ambiance juste assez hippie, du style anglo-cool qui ne se prend pas au sérieux (mais qui a son iPhone pas très loin).
C'est surtout une nourriture réconfortante, éthique, bio, végétarienne qui est à mille lieues des préjugés concernant la nourriture \" granole \". Portions généreuses, ingrédients de qualité, service au comptoir attentionné.
Seul petit bémol, le français n'est pas la langue maternelle des employés, qui le parlent tous quand même. Faudra peut-être juste répéter.

À essayer: burrito à la patate douce.
À retenir: des frais supplémentaires sont facturés lorsqu'on prend pour emporter, mais il y a amplement de place à l'intérieur pour manger."}
{"text":"I love this place and I've only been once. The food was delicious and came quickly, so I wasn't stressing about making it to my next class. Definitely going to be going back."}
{"text":"Ok I think I just found one of my new favorite spot in the city.

Could you please build one next to my place ? Please ?


Vegetarian/bio burrito restaurant : First, know one thing, when I saw that, I was like \"Meh\"

I was so wrong.

Absolutely gorgeous little place, comfy and pretty, that's already a very good start.

Sweet potato Burrito ? Hell yeah ! Good ? HELL YEAH²
Home made raspberry lemonade : MMMMhhhhhh
Nachos with spicy good salsa : Nomnomnomhothothothotnomnomnom

all this for 13$, very good deal for something so fresh and good.

I will definitely go there again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"With a narrow yet tasty selection of choices, Burritoville offers a healthy \"home-made\" alternative to the \"sandwich\" places found in this sector of the city. They have 3 to 4 options for each of their mains (burito, tacos, and quesadilla) and a few choices for your side if you chose to take your meal in a combo. Their home made salsa and chips are very good and aren't given enough credit.

There is room to eat there or you can always take your food to go AND it comes in biodegradable containers (win win!)


I've eaten here more than a few times and will continue to.

Staff is really nice as well (which is always a + in my book)

EDIT :  Went back again last night... Wow, this place is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the sweet potatoes burrito and my boyfriend had the potatoe and pepper soup. Both were delicious (especially the burrito that really satisfied my pregnancy cravings!). The service was good, however a bit slow at first. I also liked the décor; we were welcome by a nice reproduction of Frida Kalho. I would recommend for anyone who is downtown for lunch and who is hungry (the burrito is very big). It is also fair priced."}
{"text":"Why is this place rated so highly??? And why is it considered Mexican food?? Sweet potatoes are not Mexican food.... neither are apples, quinoa, or mushrooms. And please don't bother trying to bring me around, I am a born and raised SoCal girl and will fight you tooth and nail. Just call it something else, you are doing an entire culture a great injustice with your false advertising. Just wrapping something in a tortilla doesn't make it Mexican food.

I honestly cannot name a single thing that I liked about this place. It was completely empty when we went and they were out of chips, the service came off a bit pretentious, they got our order wrong, and the lemonade was so sour I couldn't drink it. Not to mention the cost! It was $30 for 2 of us and we both left hungry and completely unsatisfied. This place has already become an inside joke and a reference against which we compare other awful dining experiences."}

{"text":"Stumbled upon Burritoville today at lunch.

For the size of the portions I find it is very expensive, although I can appreciate that it is organic, homemade food. Took a good 25 minutes for our small meals to reach our table. We were sitting in the middle of a cold draft, but our table was cool. 

I really like how they have plenty of ice water in pitchers with glasses to serve yourself. Same deal for the cutlery, if you want a knife & fork, go get one. The staff will bring you your food, but nothing more, which is fine in my eyes; you're not expected to tip. 

I was very surprised by the lack of salad choice for the Combos/Trios. Today they had Quiona with a dressing or a very plain sprout type salad. I tried the Mushroom & Spinach Quesadilla with the Quiona salad & Lentil Soup. 

I'd like to go back again to try the sweet potato Burrito, but I might just order the Combo or Solo rather than the full Trio, unless they had more choice of salad. 

Thanks for reading!"}

Je peux y prendre une bon repas à la fois santé et délicieux tout en m'installant avec mon ordinateur et en prenant avantage  de l'Internet, gracieuseté d'Île sans fil.

J'aime bien la variété des à côtés mais quand j'y suis allée la dernière fois, il n'y avait plus de guacamole et il n'était que 11h45 donc j'ai été un peu déçue. On m'a suggéré un mix de crème sûre et salsa pour accompagner mes quesedillas que j'ai dévorés en un rien de temps. Je n'avais certainement pas faim une fois mon assiette terminée et si j'avais pris une des entrées comme les chips nachos, j'aurais probablement eu un peu plus mal au ventre! La majorité des plats sont aussi bons à partager avec quelqu'un d'autre pour un plus petit lunch ou pour une petite bouchée en plein milieu d'après-midi."}
{"text":"My first meal of my Montreal visit during Thanksgiving 2013. 

I picked up the two popular burrito choices - sweet potato and the pinto beans.  The former is sweet, latter is spicy.  I like the fresh ingredients and that they use a lactose tolerant cheese.  As a vegetarian, I'd much prefer Burritoville's burritos than Chipotle for example.  Soup was a warming mushroom barley mix.  Staff is helpful and friendly, great for first time visitors."}
{"text":"Walk up the creaky steps from the street and you feel like you've walked into your grandmothers house: except this house smells like burritos and there was a 15 piece brass band playing in what was once the living room; mayhem!

I had the sweet potato trio which tasted yummy (the salsa sucked though...seriously, how can you f*&k up salsa?) The beer was reasonably priced and the guac was quite tasty. The service is typical of a hipster-staffed place: slow and a tad on the clueless side...luckily I wasn't starving when I arrived here.

I really like the vibe of this place and the various corners and more quiet spaces that you can find so that conversation is possible. It is a cool old house with gorgeous wood floors and the prices are fair and everything is vegetarian: score."}
{"text":"I found it via Tripadvisor when I looked for restaurants close to my hotel because I can be lazy and I accept that :) Awesome find. Idk what was going on with me this past weekend but I totally sucked at picking out places to eat and Burritoville, aside from Sofitel room service, had the best food of my entire trip. 

Really dig the atmosphere. They play mellow music (Iron & Wine on my second trip) and there is beautiful/interesting/weird art on the walls. The gentleman behind the counter was there on both my visits (welcomed us back the second time) and he was helpful and friendly, as were the other staff. Very pleasant :) Like a Canadian version of an East Village spot, complete with patrons you would see milling around St. Marks. Saw a sign that said they have Open Mic on Mondays and when I was there on....Friday(?) they had a live band setting up....good stuff. 

Sweet Potato Burrito was crack. Seriously delicious. The reason I came back for more. My sister got the Chili burrito and liked it but said it was too spicy (not for my taste buds...how do i know? i finished it for her ^_^). Not crazy about the quinoa...it was too light and fresh for me which isn't even a relevant complaint lol, I just like my quinoa to be heavier and more savory. Drinks were yummy, I tried the raspberry lemonade and we had the root beer. Didn't find it expensive at all, but maybe that's cuz I'm a tourist and not really privy to the places that sell good food for less than $12. I would def come back here on my next trip to Montreal. 

Sidenote: the dudes who work here look like hipster models. Actually, most of the men in Montreal do. Whats up with that? It's freakish how many handsome men are walking around that city."}
