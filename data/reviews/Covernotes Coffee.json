{"text":"Covernotes feels like one of those places that is a home away from home.  It's so inviting and comfortable that you can't help but spend hours there.
The loose leaf teas are a big selling point for me.  The variety is good and I have yet to try one that I didn't like.  The food is wonderful.  It's fresh and delicious every time.  It' one of those places where once you go, you can't help but go back again and again.... and again."}
{"text":"The location is great, the exterior is great, the interior is awesome (love the book theme), but sadly the espresso wasn't much to write about.  We ordered a couple of lattes, a hot chocolate and a london fog.  Service was fast, but seemed very distracted and had trouble taking the order.

The hot chocolate was rated 'very good', but the lattes were mild and tasteless.  It's too bad, because this seemed like a very cool place.  As I said, the server seemed a bit off, which may have contributed to the espresso quality."}
{"text":"This review is not for their coffee. I ordered an egg, bacon and cheese bagel, shortbread cookie and a raspberry lemonade. Paid and as they are making they tell us that they don't have bacon or raspberry. They seem to be very unprepared. The bagel ended up being stale and cold even though I saw her put in the toaster. I don't typically like to waste food but I couldn't continue eating the sandwich. The shortbread cookie was also not good. It was reco by the cashier saying it is one of their most popular but unfortunately fell short. There were also tons of flies in the store flying around (probably 10 or more) hovering over the free water jug, free bread samples and over us as we are trying to eat. It was definitely not an enjoyable experience and the staff doesn't seem to care. I will not be returning to Covernotes again."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place doesn't have a higher rating, the coffee here is totally awesome and the service is on par too!

I got the Americana and boy did it hit the spot. Cured my coffee cravings for the day! This place is hip, trendy and cool! The drawings on the wall and the cute decorations cups placed all around all give this place it's own vibe. 

Swing by and enjoy a good strong nice cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Couple of updates I found out about this place:

First, after a great chat with owner Tom I learned that all beans they use to brew are the product of the JP Lindsay and Co Coffee company, which ironically he owns as well. that means that the great coffee you are drinking is roasted and made all by the same hands - tres cool no?

Also, I got to try a crepe made specially by Tom last night that made me weak at the knees with pleasure. A Chicken and Brie Crepe made with roasted red peppers, spinach, a little siracha hot sauce, onions and LOVE. 

These points all go for their other location in Richmond Hill which I plan to review in the near future :)

Up in Newmarket stop by soon before the open concept front patio is closed for winter."}
{"text":"I went here twice a year ago. The first time was exploratory, the second was because I had no other choice as it was the only place open. The atmosphere is nice, but if you're not a coffee drinker and you're not into eating too much meat, your options are limited. I had the grilled cheese panini both times and both times overpaid for granular cheese on bread. I might try this place again to get an updated take on their menu, but I wanted to warn those away from the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Cozy space with lots of seating. Very friendly service and employees.
Ordered two iced lattes to go. Pricier than Toronto, but larger cupsize.
The coffee was on point for me. The only small problem was that there were some grounds at the bottom which to me suggests a problem in the espresso machine, so I won't hold it against them.
Overall, a spot that perfectly reflects Newmarket's historic vibe and has a lot of hip charm. 
Will be back for sure for a sit-down."}
{"text":"Very quaint Tea/Coffee shop in the cute village-like strip of Newmarket called Main St. 
I stopped in here for a little sit-down, killing time till I had to be at an event across the street. 
Walking in, you instantly smell the aroma of coffee and that good 'ol book smell. You can peruse the shelves of the store of their previously owned books while they prepare your beverage of choice. They also provide options for paninis and sweet treats to accompany your drink. My choice was the ever so seasonally suitable, Pumpkin Spice latté. It was strong espresso and heavy on cinnamon but not too sweet. Just right. 
The guy was solo managing behind the counter and asked how my day was going and about any highlights, very easy to talk to. He wasn't intrusive in any way and let me enjoy my quiet time at a table inside. 
I'm not from Newmarket but this would definitely be a place to stop again if in the area. Oh and it was toasty warm, perfect for the chill-phobic girl in me as autumn approaches. Happy time!"}
{"text":"A very cozy and friendly cafe on main street. Such nice staff and positive place. All organic and vegetarian menu option. They have a nice reading room at the back. Love this place. It's a must go!"}
{"text":"Headline: WHOA! A coffee shop with books, crepe's and coffee?  

Stopped by this coffee shop and \"stalked\" a few fellow Yelpers before the January 2014 GTA Elite event

-Ordered a London Fog latte.  At first, I got a huge whiff of milk and it was overwhelming.  However, after a couple of sips, I started to enjoy it more.  It was a very strong Earl Grey tea, but it seemed to have a good ratio of coffee to milk.  Much better than Second Cup
-They actually have books! Like old school books!  With soft covers! 
-They have crepes!  
-Amazingly friendly baristas!  

Dislike
-Washroom was kinda dirty and is unisex.  

Verdict:  Great indie coffee shop in the area."}
{"text":"Always looking for funky and wonderful coffee houses (which are hard to find), but this is a gem tucked into downtown Newmarket. 

Little funky little place with about 5 tables up front and more in the back.  Loads of books (new and old, for adults and kids)

I had a long double espresso (which was not very hot actually) and a chilli and cheese scone which had more a texture of a muffin, but still good. 

Lots of loose teas for sale  as well. 

Two staff members very attentive with all customers and they bring"}
{"text":"Covernotes was a neat little café.
I ordered the chai latte here. The desserts looked good. I wanted to save room though so I didn't order any food.
The chai was pretty good (I have to say, I love Aroma's a little better), much better than Starbucks'.
I liked how they had a lot of organic tea for purchase.
There's also a bunch of books here. I didn't really get a chance to look around as my visit was brief.
The place is very quaint and cozy.
They had little teeny cups and a jug of water for guests (I really liked that!).
The staff and patrons were so sociable and friendly.  It must be because we're so far north (kidding).
A very charming place. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars at the moment because its not like I've tried everything here but I've been hitting this place up for its espresso lately (in americano form) So I'm sorta a starbucks kind of dude but like hunting for stuff , I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful this drink was. Sometimes a strong espresso drink can give you a bit of dry mouth after but their roast is still smooth without taking a hit in the taste. So I'll keep hitting this caffeinated gem on main street. The people working there are very pleasant too and it's just a generally good vibe in the place."}
{"text":"Very cute place with nice barostas and tons of books to choose from. Great selection of loose tea"}
{"text":"I was visiting Newmarket for another event and before I was leaving for the long drive back to Hamilton I decided to take a little walk around and find myself a coffee shop. Thats when I came across Covernotes!

There is ample seating, piles and piles of books, and locally grown and brewed coffee - what more could you want!? It's rare to go somewhere and see a ton of books - besides a library. Covernotes has a nice nostalgic feeling to it. I'm such a coffee snob and I wanted to try a bunch of things but it was such a hot day so I settled for a iced latte. I was really full from my event so I didn't try any food, but everything sounded good! There was coffee and loose tea on sale as well.

Staff were extremely friendly and were happy to give me some directions around the town. I thought that was really nice! There is a little patio out front as well, but I was hot and opted to sit for a few minutes inside the air conditioning. 

Next time that I am in the Newmarket area, I'll be sure to stop in and have some food and try more of their coffee!"}
{"text":"Hey ho, found it on Yelp! I was visiting family in the GTA and craving a cozy cup of coffee and a small town main street vibe. I pulled out the magical Yelp app of deliciousness and power and Kris U's review mentioning locally roasted coffee and the photos of the books got me and my aunt excited enough to jump in the car and make the mini trek from Aurora. A suburban triumph ensued. We arrived in time for a fresh pot of coffee, which was delicious, and tucked into the quiet back room totally full of piles of second hand books. The bagel sandwich was filling and tasty, and the service was exceptionally friendly and funny and kind. I was so thankful to find a spot that wasn't a chain, that had heart and quality and quirk and warmth, that made my experience of the suburbs kinder to this Quebecer far from home."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this quaint little gem on Main Street. Very cosy with exposed brick and beams. Comfortable seats and tables, warm staff and great teas and pastries. A nice place to read or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Main Street Newmarket is a happening place to visit. After a run or walk in the park or attending the farmers market sarurday morning no better place to relax and enjoy a snack than Covernotes."}
{"text":"I drive by this coffee house many times but never drop in until today.  Why Today?  I was attracted by the signage outside, it's white, it's bright and it looked very modern unlike the other shops on main st Newmarket.  Best of all, it had the word espresso on it which immediately caught my attention being a coffee lover.  Aside from a good brunch place, another thing missing in Aurora/Newmarket is a good independent roaster/coffee house.  I am a frequent visitor of DT cafes like pilot, reunion island, Te aro so to see an independent coffee shop in my hood was super exciting. 

Although the outside looked very modern, the inside isn't very so. It had old tables and chairs but work quite well with the exposed brick wall. The space extends to the back with shelfs of book available for you grab and read at your leisure while sipping on a latte. This idea I like however, there were 2 big communal tables in the room which made the space felt really cramped. 

Now on to the coffee, I ordered an americano misto to test out the taste of their beans.  It's not as good as the places I mentioned above but it's not bad either so I would much rather come here to support local small businesses than the typical Starbucks or Tim's. 

I think this place got great potential if the inside also gets a facelift like the outside."}
{"text":"The potential for this place is great as Newmarket doesn't have many independent cafes. However, Covernotes is disappointing. The regular cup of coffee is bland, tasteless unremarkable. The milk/sugar station is quaint, could be more professional. Needs more detail in the cleaning department. Not many enticing goodies at all, the display case seemed barren with hardly any selection worth noticing.
Step it up, Covernotes, you have a golden opportunity here in this town. A little too amateurish. Visit some independent cafes down in Toronto and get some ideas."}
{"text":"Covernotes is unpretentious and down to earth. 

Having a coffee and chill out here is just like hanging at a friend's house. Especially at the backroom with mismatched furniture and bookcases of books! 

Barista is also the cook. A guy with multi talent! and he is super friendly too!

Free Wifi just ask for the password. If you rather not reading books but watching Youtube like me!"}
