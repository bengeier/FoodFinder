{"text":"Great dive bar with great wings!  The other food looks great too but I've never gotten past the wings.  Original sauces and great dry rubs.  I always ask for heavy seasoning on the dry rubs, Chris then cakes the wings.  I drink more beer. It's a great equation.    Erica is the bartender I see the most.  She's a sweetheart and then some!  Cute and funny which is my kind of bartender, she'll have you full of food, beer, and laughs before you know it.  Ask for the ET. special...it's her own wing creation.  As far as Lorain County goes, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great wings and good drink specials! Karoke on Fridays is fun...always seems to be an interesting crowd."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time last night. Waited forever as we watched the bartender chat with customers (from their side of the bar). Patrons saw us come in (who were talking to her) and did nothing to tell her she had patrons waiting. Had to get up and go to her to ask if we could order drinks. I'll go again after reading reviews, but not a good first impression on the service. The entire time we waited she did not serve one other drink, so she wasn't busy working."}
{"text":"Came in for their wings, the best in Lorain county. Garlic parmesan takes me to a wing utopia"}
{"text":"If the cook was more worried about the chicken than the chicken heads, maybe. 20 minutes, 20 bucks, and mine were so overcooked they were throwaways.  First and only time for me."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to Chicken Wing Heaven!  I decided to give this place a try after seeing their name mentioned on Cleveland.com last year as being nominated for best wings in Cleveland. I don't know how they are not #1 because their wings are out of this world good. The place is a small little neighborhood dive bar and had I not read about them I would've never found out. Boy, am I glad I did. It's like finding a hidden treasure. Their sauces are amazing and lets face it if you know how to cook a wing right then it boils down to the sauce.   We've tried the chain restaurants like Quaker Steak & Lube and many other not so big places. ZZ's Big Top in Avon is somewhat of a contender but can't say that they're anywhere close to being better.  After searching for the perfect wings I have to say that I have found them. The search is over. Nothing compares to McCrann's.  We always call ahead and place our order for pickup. Our favorites are the Spicy Garlic Parm and the Ouch wings. Extra sauce off course!  The 2 flavors can only be ordered by the dozen at $9.50/dozen."}
{"text":"Upon my 3rd try of this place I love the irony of a Bengal fan ordering the daily special \"Cinci Chili\" in Browns country. I really enjoy this place it obviously locally owned by some great people. If your traveling to or just passing by stop in its not far off the highway and you'll get a great value for you dollar."}
{"text":"This place is different. It is not your typical corporate bar. I have been to a lot of restaurants and have chefs come talk to me but never the owner. He actually cares about his customers and wants to make sure they are satisfied. The wings are bigger than anywhere else and the sauces are award winning. Cheesy fries actually have real cheese on them and not from a can. This is a must visit place because the food is not only good quality but fresh as well. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I've known the owner for a number of years, and we all grew up together.  I've been to the pub a handful of times, and they have the best wings in the Cleveland area, and  the best I have ever had bar none.  Each and every time I come in the bartenders are friendly, greet you with smile and nice word, even the karaoke DJ is a good enough guy to greet the regulars that come in.  McCrann's also does an absolute KILLER reuben sandwich that needs to be called a \"sammich\", the most meat stuffed in between two pieces of bread I have ever seen. You almost have to unhinge your jaw to get a good sized bite, instead of a nibble.  Plenty of beer on draft and local beers as well.  An owner that cares about his customers and personally speaks to them to ask about their experience? Unheard of in this day and age.  He has even said he wants his customers to be comfortable, and doesn't worry about the bar being packed, just his patrons being happy.  Well done Mr. McCrann, you are truly the cat's pajamas!!!"}
{"text":"So the thing about this place is that they do have really amazing wings. And their toilet paper is the best. They don't get that 1-ply bullshit. Not that those two are directly related, I am just pretty impressed with the TP they had stocked. Usually dive bars have really awful TP and I'm not sure if that's just because they think you won't notice if you're really drunk or what. Anyway, try the wings. Karaoke on Friday is pretty entertaining as well."}
{"text":"We had contemplated stopping here for a couple months for karaoke. We finally did and wished we hadn't. They stop serving half their menu at 9:45 (really on a Friday night??) the bartender wasn't very friendly and they only had one beer on draft all and all not a great experience. Maybe even a bit overpriced for location."}
{"text":"Thank you for your hospitality Erica and I have to say....these are some of THE best wings I have EVER had.  You really have to come in here and try these!  Wings are out of this world Paul.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I am a sauce man through and through, but at McCrann's the dry rubs are where it's at. You can tell they put a lot of time into their rubs, not just using straight out of the bottle McCormick seasonings. The rubs are gritty, citrusy, and crispy, perfectly adhering to the crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside wing. I've been here five times and each time the bartenders have been super friendly and engaging. It is definitely a dive bar atmosphere but the restrooms are well taken care of and there's a pool table and darts. As a wing connoisseur I highly recommend this place."}
