{"text":"Great Pho! You will quickly become a regular like myself, and so many reviewers before me. The food is what keeps you coming back, but the great customer service and value are awesome perks."}
{"text":"Best pho and yellow curry on the planet - bar none.  When I travel I can no longer order yellow curry because I know I will only be disappointed.  Everything else Ive tried on the menu is also superior.  Give the Singapore noodles a whirl - addictive.  Ask for Diane - her sparkling personality and passion for her work will make your day."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Gilbert for years and we have never found an Asian place like Simis! It is truly a must try, especially in the Gilbert/Mesa area where every restaurant is a chain. The staff is attentive and make great recommendations! The food is fresh, tasty and always served fast and exactly as ordered. We have definitely found a new place! Highly recommended dishes: Orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken and house chow mein!"}
{"text":"The food was so bland. My wife got shrimp fried rice and I've had better at the food court in the mall. And I had a seafood soup that lacked a lot of seafood... both of our shrimps in our meals were dehydrated flavorless  not fresh shrimp ...we will not eat there again .. not sure what all the stars were about"}
{"text":"Did not realize they close at 8 midweek, walked in at 7:45 hoping to get takeout. They insisted we sit and relax and take our time. My husband wasn't feeling well, so she insisted on tea for him and was very kind. We both had the beef pho, which was delicious. A little salty, but quickly remedied with some sriracha and fresh lime.
The restaurant is clean and inviting, the staff was gracious and attentive, and the food was delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there for the 1st! Excellent service and food. Will be back for dinner most definitely."}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the food in fantastic. My wife and I love going to Simi's."}
{"text":"I have worked about 2 miles from this place for over 5 years and never been.  I have driven by it countless times and seen the $4.99 lunch special and thought I should stop in but never have.  Well, this last Friday I was meeting my cousin for lunch and he wanted to try it because he said the reviews were great.  I looked them up when he said that because I was surprised but I was even more surprised by how awesome the reviews actually were.  
We were there for lunch so of course we each got the lunch special.  It includes egg drop soup, a spring role, a crab puff, rice and the entree.  I got Mongolian Beef and my cousin got Orange Chicken because he asked what was the most popular and the waiter told him it was definitely the orange chicken.  Anyway, I tried his and he tried mine and we both thought it was great.   This is probably the best deal around.  I paid the extra $.50 so I could get brown rice but that quantity of great tasting food was amazing.  I plan on being a regular from now on."}
{"text":"Simi's Cafe is outstanding!  The owners are extremely friendly and accommodating, and the food is terrific.  I'm always on the lookout for a place that makes good pho and Simi's does not disappoint.  The red chicken curry is excellent as well.  Between the service, the food, extremely reasonable pricing, and clean decor, Simi's is definitely a winner.  I'll definitely be going there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I was excited to try this place since it is getting harder to find good chinese food here.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed

chicken pot stickers - good texture and quality but little flavor.  These needed some ginger or shiitake mixed in.

hot and sour soup - not hot or sour.  Good ingredients but very flat. little flavor.

mongolian beef - OK no major complaints but not up to what c fu used to make.

pork fried rice (I asked for bean sprouts with this) - this was the best dish.  very good.

I'll try it again, not bad but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Simi's never fails to deliver. I've gone here quite a few times since moving to the valley in April. The food is tasty and fresh! This has to be the first Chinese food place I've been to where they use more chicken than breading and I love that, I like to know my money is well spent. Everything I've tried from here is excellent, the owner even went as far as remembering my name and she knows I get something different even time. I will always count on this place for excellent food and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a great find! The owner seems to know just about everyone who comes in the door and the service is excellent. The restaurant is very clean! I came for the pho and was not disappointed, yummy broth."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after having a craving for Chinese and searching Yelp for something good in the area. 

I was by myself and was just ordering takeout, but the waitress was very friendly and attentive. She gave good recommendations and was very pleasant. My order was prepared fairly quickly and I took it home and not only was it excellent, but it was enough to easily feed two people. I should have stopped eating halfway through and saved the rest for another day, but it was too good so I finished it up. 

I'd definitely recommend trying this place out. It's nice to find a quality Chinese takeout place, so let's keep this one in business."}
{"text":"We moved down from Seattle where there you can get Pho on every corner. It's a bit harder to find here in Arizona and even harder to find a good place and one that's vegan friendly. We absolutely love Simis. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. It's pretty charming when on our second visit they recognized us and remembered our order. We get the vegetarian pho with vegetable broth and it's wonderful every time. I feel they truly go out of their way to make sure you have the most wonderful experience. 5 stars all around. Truly love these people."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch because my friend needed vegetarian broth. They had quite a few vegetarian choices. Service was fantastic and food came out in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, very inexpensive and very welcoming staff. My Fiancé and I go there at least once a week and get their pho or orange chicken lunch special. It is really good!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp. It is a great place! Comfortable seating with very attentive and polite service. This coupled with the delicious and authentic food made the experience delightful. I highly recommend this place! And they have pebble ice which makes the best Thai tea."}
{"text":"After much fanfare I came to finally try out Simi's and came out more then happy with my experience. The staff was friendly and helpful with any questions or requests I had while i was there. They're very nice and give the place a warm and inviting atmosphere. The food came out piping hot and tasted wonderful. When I'm around again I will certainly come visit again"}
{"text":"The best Orange chicken around and their new Poke bar is Amazing! Got to try this place."}
{"text":"The orange chicken was the absolute best dish that we ordered out of the four. Just a word to the wise there is no beer or cocktails."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite place to eat, my bf and I go every Saturday!
Orange chicken. Hong Kong soup. Eggplant pork. Try anything- it is all good! 

The owners are amazing, Diane (hopefully I spelled her name right! D:) always makes us feel right at home and normally grabs my bf his coke before we even have to ask! 

Besides the staff (who we love dearly!) the food is incredible. I only give five stars to restaurants where I can close my eyes and pick something random off the menu. Everything I have had at Simi's has been perfect!"}
{"text":"Was there last niight, I do love the food however it is hit and miss, I ordered for a large party one night one of my dishes was minus any chicken but  after home who wants to go back out. Oh well , they are somewhat close, and inexpensive."}
{"text":"They have Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai food all infused into one menu ....the best part is that there are several vegetarian and vegan options here ! My go to dishes are the veggie rolls, veggie soup, eggplant with kung pao, orange tofu, mixed veggies and veggie chow fun. So delicious and the owners are so sweet, no matter how many times we come here she always comes out to ask if everything is ok."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place. If only for the super friendly service it is worth it. However, we had spring and summer rolls, pho tai bo vien, Kung pao chicken and a veg stirfry. All were very good. 

I can't say enough about the service. Fast extremely friendly and not in the least bit over bearing."}
{"text":"Some of the beat Chinese food I've had. Their pot stickers are phenomenal! Also, their lunch specials are the best. From the customer service to the food, everything is 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove past the place several times and did not notice the restaurant until they hanged the decorative flags outside the building.  We decided to give it a try last night and was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service.

We ordered both the deep-fried and fresh spring rolls for appetizers and they were both delicious. I used to think Little Saigon in Glendale has the best spring roll but this place might have topped them.  My wife and I both ordered pho and the broth had so much flavor.  I think the pho should have more meat in it and I think the owner is trying to balance the price and the portion of the serving size.  The pho is only $5.75.

The restaurant also has Thai and Chinese dishes on the menu.  We definitely will go back to try out the Thai curry dishes.  The service is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Happy Chinese New Year!  First time eating here and the food matches the service, excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and the service is AMAZING! Love this little gem!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food restaurant. The orange chicken is perfectly flavored and the texture has just the right amount of crispiness. We love their kalamari chili appetizer. It is always cooked just right and the sauce that it is served with is delicious. My kids aged 6 and 2 enjoy eating the orange chicken as well as their chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Just got home from having an amazing dinner. The Pho was very delicious, and service was very attentive. I will definitely be going back there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Friendly staff and amazing affordable food! My husband and I go here regularly. I love the Pho!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I am no stranger to pho, this was a great and tasty bowl of noodles, sliced beef and hot broth right down the street from my room. The huge bowl of pho came with the usual suspects on the side ie..bean sprouts, basil , lime and sliced jalapenos.
 
I also ordered the pork spring rolls, and shrimp rice wrapper rolls. The pork rolls were served hot and crispy with a nice fish dipping sauce. The rice wrapped rolls were stuffed with veggies , sliced pork and shrimp. Very fresh and light.

The service was great and the owner was fantastic. Will b back for sure!"}
{"text":"About to order it now. My wife gets the pho. I get the vermicelli noodles with pork and egg rolls. And an egg drop soup (egg flower soup). We also like the summer rolls and chicken lettuce wraps. The food is served fresh with excellent service and nice people. We typically get takeout but it is a nice place to eat in as well. I hope for many years of success for them as they are a terrific local establishment with excellent Chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The service was phenomenal. I truly have not experienced such kindness & quick service anywhere as I have here. I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps for appetizer & the orange chicken for an entree. We definitely will be back to try out more of the menu & we plan to bring family & friends."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go yesterday from this restaurant for the first time, and was not impressed. The food tasted like it had been cooked earlier in the day... Just didn't taste fresh, and didn't have all that much flavor. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly, helpful staff. The pho was authentic with awesome portions. The owner told me it is a family recipe boiled at least 10 hours with no MSG. I also recommend the salt and pepper wings and iced Vietnamese coffee. What a nice surprise."}
{"text":"The BEST PHO SOUP in Gilbert....so hard to fine great quality and excellent customer service. All their food is so delicious My family and I enjoy very much going there.. if you are reading this have no doubts you will be very pleased you went. I'm a very picky of where I go and although outside can be a little deceiving, the quality is the BEST!  Family oriented, they are great people."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Employees are always quick and polite. Great place to take the family."}
{"text":"Very good. This is a place you would drive by without a thought, but I decided to try it once. What a gem. Very good food!"}
{"text":"Amazing beef Pho, summer rolls are great and super friendly service. Best place in the East Valley for Pho!!!"}
{"text":"ate here a few times.  first two times good.  This time was not good.  Service was slow.  First dish was a seafood pad thai.  It was mostly noddles, with very little seafood.  The second dish, which came 20 minutes later was seafood pain fried noodles.  The noodles were burnt.  Again, there was very little in the way of actual seafood and mostly noodles.  The mushrooms were also almost raw."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Diane is seriously the most pleasant server I have encountered in a long time. Great soup."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was quite good. Mongolian beef was tasty.  Stopped in for a busy lunch hour with just two servers but they managed to keep up pretty well.  Might stop back if in the area but probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"This is a FABULOUS place! The service is always amazing. And the food is delicious! We love getting the pho which is outstanding. And the chicken dishes we have tried have all been incredible. Highly recommend to all. My kids LOVE coming here as well!"}
{"text":"They were named best Chinese food in Arizona in a Yahoo Foods article, so I had to try it. I must say, the food is good, not the best I've ever had, but they do have the absolute best orange chicken anywhere. Worth going just for that dish. The bonus is the friendly staff, they have a lot of regulars and each are greeted by name. Very cool, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. The owner (or the head waitress?) was super nice. We got the green curry and the vietnamese coffee. So delicious."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Food tastes very fresh, and is not 'heavy', neither of which can be assumed with Chinese food.  Portions are good-sized but not ridiculous (I'm appropriately hungry by dinner when I eat lunch there). The staff is very friendly, and genuine.  And the prices are reasonable/low.  Location (strip mall) is a bit odd, but the interior is quite pleasant.  
I find myself there a couple times a month for lunch."}
{"text":"Closed when I thought they were open got an answering machine they said they'd call back drove their business is closed and not good practice in business"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here often. We try a new dish every time. BUT we always get the same 2 dishes every time: Yellow Curry, its one of the best I've had all over the country and the Black pepper chicken, it is very tasty. Both are so full of flavor! Healthy too which is a huge plus! 

The prices are very reasonable. Service is very friendly, And you have to get the lemonade! 

If your feeling Asian food! Go here. If you don't want a chain restaurant and something local. Go here!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! Try the fish cakes, the calamari, the spicy soup and the pan fried noodles! I have tried something different the last three times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Would second the notion that it doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is very nice and comfortable. 
Only tried the Chicken Pho Noodles and they were GREAT!
The staff is extremely nice. 
Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. Clean facilities with pleasant atmosphere. Outstanding Pho, excellent yellow curry, fresh veggies served hot. Definitely plan to return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Diane is amazing and is always sure to remember names and drink favorites. The food is always freshly prepared and spot on. I have loved everything I have ever had although I tend to stick with the Vietnamese pork chop or the peppered beef. My husband loves it just as much as I do and usually gets Pho or the wonton soup."}
{"text":"We've visited this restaurant about 4 times and every time it has been great.  The owner is such a nice, friendly and warm hearted person.  It's always nice to see her.  Our favorite dish is the Pho, my wife graves it from time to time.  We've tried the Pho at several restaurants but always compare it to this place.  If you enjoy Pho, I would recommend that you eat it here."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant - decor updated from previous restaurant in this location. Service very friendly and helpful with the menu, which offers a lot of choices.  The food was very good - started with the Tom Tom soup, which was very tasty but too spicy for me.  They toned down the portion I took home and it was just right.  The green curry chicken was delicious and just the right amount of fire for me.  The restaurant is family owned, well run, good service and great food.  The staff works hard and it shows.  I highly recommend Simi's to everyone who enjoys Asian cuisine and friendly, local restaurants."}
{"text":"Received a message from my daughter that she just read that the best Chinese restaurant in Arizona was near me.  So off I went to give it my opinion.  The service is very friendly but the place is small and in a strip center so you might miss it.  Look close and you will be rewarded.  I had the lunch special, great value, and had the kung pao chicken.  Enough spice to make it earn the hot logo and more than enough food on the plate.  I really enjoyed the soup.  Usually a lunch special comes with a throw away type soup but this one would have been great to order by a bowl full and enjoy as a meal.  I am glad I found it and I am glad I tried it and now I will enjoy trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"Oh my GOODNESS...found this place on Yelp and tried it and it was amazing!  Not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was superb!  Abby was our waitress and was very helpful and friendly.  Not to mention, a few of the other ladies working came to our table to see how we were doing and thank us for coming in.  If I could, I'd give them 10 stars!  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"We had ordered Pad Thai, and Red Curry, but the food was not good at all. I'm not sure what spice they used, but it made the dish smell like garbage. This is not an exageration, the dishes smelt quite literally like garbage. It was not edible the smell was so strong. The women at the front counter was very polite as we paid her and picked up our food, other than that, I cannot recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This is an update from my review on 12/23/13. Since then I have had their food many times. Their food is consistently well prepared, fresh ingredients and is quite delicious. Very friendly service with staff who remember you. Priced very reasonable. In a city of chain restaurants, it's so refreshing to go to this one. Try it!!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome the service is outstanding and the food is so delicious and fresh my favorite is the orange chicken and if you like Pho this place is for everyone"}
{"text":"An unexpected delight. Moving from Los Angeles, I didn't think I could find good Pho in the area, but I found great Pho. Call me a \"regular\" because I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!! The food was delicious (some of the best dumplings I've had!!) and the staff was very friendly and make you feel welcome! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! We went to Simis after reading that they ranked #1 for Chinese food in AZ. We were not disappointed and now see why they were #1. Their food is so good! My favorite Mongolian beef I've ever had. Great lunch specials too. The server there is so sweet she remembers us every time we go in. We drive all the way from Glendale to go that's how good it is! It's almost a 2hr round trip drive and I would make it any time just to have Simis!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, i have to jump on the hype train with regards to the orange chicken!  Best I ever had! Food was hot, fresh, and FAST!  I mean the food came out around 5 mins after we ordered.  WOW!  As a plus the cute waitress explained the difference between chow fan and chow fun.  Great food and educational!"}
{"text":"It's the best! Always delicious! The beef pho and the orange chicken are two of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here four times and each time we have come away raving about the food.  In love with the lettuce wraps and chai tea, but everything was great.  The service is quick, friendly and helpful!  I can't complain!  Will plan on making this the family favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho, my wife likes the orange chicken and pepper beaf. All there food is good"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to eat Asian food. You can find Vietnamese, Chinese and some Thai dishes too.  Their Beef Pho is so flavorful. Thai ice tea is excellent :)"}
{"text":"Simi serves excellent fresh food at a fair price. The yellow curry was fantastic. You will not be disappointed wit simi."}
{"text":"Great food. Best orange chicken around. Crispy and sweet. The texture of the food is the best part of this place. It's not that nasty, soggy stuff you get at other asian restaurants."}
{"text":"I was not let down! The service was great, the prices were very reasonable. I liked that it was very low key and quiet when we went. All of our food was cooked very well and was so tasty!! I will be visiting again !"}
{"text":"I've been to Simi's about 10 times since around the time it opened and they have always had excellent food.  The servers are very attentive and want to make sure the food is satisfactory.  I have nothing bad to say, the pho here is my favorite and I haven't had a better orange chicken.  I'm very pleased with the service at Simi's.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We were in Arizona over the Christmas break and ate here multiple times. The food was outstanding and the service was great too! My favorite dish was the yellow curry, but it would be hard to go wrong at this place. The only thing we didn't love was the pad Thai. Everything else we tried was pretty great.

This is a family run business that I would love to see do well. The hostess seemed to know most people by name and clearly this family is working hard to make great food and appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"Found this hidden jem a couple weeks ago and can't seem to get enough this is my third time eating I've gotten many items in the on the menu my favorite being the orange chicken! Definitely the best Chinese food I've had!!"}
{"text":"Good food and the service was great. Was visiting on a business trip and will come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the red curry chicken and red curry shrimp.  We order every week as they have the best curry we have found in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Like Renata K. I am in the minority here. But, I stand by my rating.

I ate here on the recommendation of my brother and his fiance and looked forward to a good bowl of Pho. I followed the server's recommendation of the beef Pho. Responding to her attempt to up-sell me from the basic bowl, I told her I did not like meatballs. I ended my order with veggie spring rolls.

My food came out quickly. It also came out wrong: veggie eggs rolls and beef Pho with meatballs. The busser appeared quickly and asked me if everything was okay. I told her about the mistakes, she apologized, but did not reappear, nor did my server. I figured they were busy and I didn't want to make a fuss. 

This would not have been a problem. But, the eggs rolls were mushy and lacked flavor. Even this could have been saved by the Pho. I took out the meatballs and the Pho did taste good. It was definitely homemade, but the noodles were overcooked and broke apart on my chopsticks. There was also a grit at the bottom of my bowl. 

I don't doubt that the food is good. But, it seemed like they fell asleep on me. It was rather disappointing after the recommendation that brought me there."}
{"text":"Average ambience, slow service but great food. The PHO is one of the best in the valley. Everything is fresh and delicious. If they could just step up their service and brighten the place up a bit it would make a world of difference. If you're just all about the food this is your place. If you want nice ambience and service you may want to skip this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place because it got good reviews on Yelp and was close to our neighborhood. I have recently travelled to Vietnam and was craving some authentic pho. The parking lot was full when we pulled up, which is always a good sign. The dining area is a nice size, not too small or too big, and the decor is tasteful and \"nicer\" than most Asian quick food restaurants we've been to. The servers were attentive and friendly. We also observed them doing a lot of takeaway business. I got the chicken pho and summer rolls. Both were great and satisfied my craving. My husband got the kung pao chicken and said it was good. I also tried and enjoyed the green tea, it was light and refreshing, and not too much sugar. The menu is a good mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, as the restaurant description suggests. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Would recommend this place. Although I only tried their veggie egg rolls and beef pho noodle soup. But the soup was great and servers are nice. Although they did accidentally put cilantro into my soup after I requested no cilantro. But everything is great!"}
{"text":"Pho was excellent.  Very flavorful.
Their menu had a lot of options.  A mixture of Chinese and Vietnamese.  Pretty busy on a Friday night however they were very quick on the service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place!  The food is delicious and the service is even better!  Chicken and eggplant is to die for!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family to enjoy a vegetarian dinner. Their asian/cantonese dishes are excellent. Good vegetarian/vegan selection.

We ordered the 
- eggplant in kungpao sauce - absolutely delicious!
- curry vegetables - light and flavorful
- crispy tofu - the best that I've had in a long time! Its crispy on the outside and hot soft tofu on the inside paired with a flavorful dipping sauce.
- vegetarian fried rice - very good
- veggie spring roll - good
- Tofu lettuce wrap - excellent

The food was very well prepared and served. Both the food and service was exceptional. The wait staff was courteous, inviting, and friendly. This is definitely my kitchen away from home and I will come back and visit often even though its a bit far.

The restaurant interior is clean and the decor is modern, tasteful and elegant. The booths are very comfortable and luxurious.

Overall a great dining experience and the prices are just right."}
{"text":"Not aesthetically pleasing on the exterior but so super delicious. The pho and orange chicken are fabulous. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow. Work in the area and decided to stop in for a weekday lunch. Service was great. Food was beyond wow. Best orange chicken I have ever had. Pho is decent as well. Will definately return."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Had lunch there twice, one take out. We will go back. The first tme I went for take out they gave me soup while I waited. The outside could use some work,  if not for the reveiws here we would have missed a good place."}
{"text":"affordable, best spring rolls in town! definitely will be returning soon"}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant twice a month and it's phenomenal! From the beef Pho, to the chicken basil, and the pork crispy egg rolls. The flavors, and tantalizing aromas, will have your senses singing for joy."}
{"text":"Tried Simi's last night for the first time, and really enjoyed it. The Pho was delicious. The Tom Yum soup was spicy and tasty, with a nice presentation. The staff, friendly and helpful. The price, right. Try it, you'll like it. Why go to a chain restaurant when you can enjoy a family-owned restaurant and their family recipes?"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Recommend them anytime, best in Az. The Orange chicken is awesome, but everything they make is, really."}
{"text":"The food and service at Simi's Cafe is excellent.  I have visited five times now: every meal was stellar and I was made to feel right at home.  I cannot recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Chicken Pho.  It was repulsive, because it wasn't Pho.  Fatty chicken broth with soggy vegetables and shriveled over cooked chicken served without any traditional Pho accoutrements (no lime, bean sprouts, jalapeño or basil).  The broth was completely devoid of any traditional aromatics that make the broth such a delicacy.  

I feel bad saying this because the staff was very nice and friendly but we came for the Pho and left horribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good pho at a price you can't beat.  Delicious fresh potstickers to accompany.  Great local spot to check out. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We just ate here for the first time, and we loved it. The crab puffs were some of the best I've ever eaten. The  egg rolls we're good, and the broccoli beef was wonderful. The restaurant is clean and has a modern decor compared to other Asian restaurants I've been to, and the service was fast. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The BEST Asian food in the east valley and we have tried a lot. When people rave about the orange chicken they aren't lying. We eat here consistently since finding it and are never disappointed. I always eat the orange chicken and my husband eats their yellow curry. All are delicious. The owner is fantastic as well and always comes over to our table to greet us and play with my boys. She even brings my youngest animal crackers or cookies before we love. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"One star because they deliver. They forgot one of our entrees and the food overall was just ok. Not as authentic as I hoped. The curry was the best thing we ordered. Teriyaki and other sauces are very sugary and full of preservatives."}
{"text":"Wonderful, family-run restaurant that is impeccably clean, with modern & upscale decor.

The service is attentive & friendly -- the sweet owner Diane learns your name and your specific tastes after just a couple of visits.

The food is almost absurdly reasonably priced (you wonder how they make a profit), yummy and expertly prepared, amazingly so for a family-owned place. You'd think the cook should be in L.A. or New York.

To be honest I can't comment on anything other than the chicken chow mein -- I've ordered it for years (even back at their former location over in the northwest valley, in Deer Valley), and desire it prepared in a certain way. It is heavenly: I'd pay $50 for it. I usually take home an additional order or two.

In reality, the menu is sort of optional -- they'll accommodate your selection in pretty much any way you want, no matter how unusual.

Do yourself a favor: no matter where you are in the valley, give Simi's Cafe a try. You're welcome, in advance."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES Chinese food and I just like it and therefore he's far less picky about It than I am. While running errands, we saw a little dive Chinese restaurant that had really bad reviews and no a/c (huge negative during August in AZ), so putting a nix on that one, I consulted YELP and guided him to this place, Simi's Cafe. The food was great!!  I LOVED (not just liked) my Red Curry with Chicken and his Mongolian Beef was really good too.  Our waitress was fantastic; kind, knowledgable, attentive and our food was brought out much faster than I had anticipated. Overall great dining experience. I highly recommend this little gem even if you don't LOVE Chinese food...but you just might LOVE it after eating at Simi's."}
{"text":"Beef pho was good, large bowl with all the fixings, service was excellent, we also tried the chicken potstickers very good. Teriyaki chicken came in large bowl and flavored nicely my 3 year old is a picky eater that only wants chicken strips with ranch dressing everywhere we go but he loved the teriyaki chicken!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and yummy! Grrreat customer service and atmosphere. 2 thumbs up! Some Vietnamese items, some Cantonese, and Thai as well! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I cannot even explain how thrilled I am to finally find AMAZING Chinese food!!  I have been searching for over two years since moving from New York City.  I had almost given up until giving this place a shot.  The summer rolls are fresh and delicious!  I love the pork chow mien, all the flavors just work and the noodles are cooked perfectly.  The Chinese style lettuce wraps were also fresh and delicious!  The prices are more than fair for the quantity and quality of the food.  I cannot wait to try more items!!!  Great job to this restaurant!  And THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"First time customer, found the female taking my order over the phone to be very pleasant and helpful. Ordered the pho, cashew chicken & veg fried rice. Taking the suggestion of the female, I ordered the standard pho, she advised if I liked it, come back and try the other types, that will definitely happen. The cashew chicken was good with a lot of flavor, the veg fried rice was ok, just needed a little umph is all.
Overall a very good experience and I will for sure return, staff was very nice and helpful on a simple take out order, so I look forward to having a sit down dinner there."}
{"text":"Love this place! The beef pho is the best around, the service is always top notch and place is always immaculate, we try and come at least once a week, whether dine in or take out, gotta have it."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently. My husband loves the beef pho! Clean, great service and have not been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food ever. Not only is everything they make delicious, but everyone is super friendly. The lunch special is a crazy good deal. Their Pho is also THE BEST!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pho I have had in AZ.  Coming from the Bay Area, I've been settling for slightly above average Pho until yesterday when I happened to find this gem.  The staff are truly amazing and positive people.  I plan on being here at least three times a week! Only other item I had were the summer rolls.  They were good, but their Pho is life.  I've heard their calamari is very good too."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that fool you.  Excellent Asian food here!  I had the yellow chicken curry, and it was perfectly balanced and complex.  And delicious!"}
{"text":"My mom loves this place I'm a little picky..she takes a medication that makes her a little out of it every time she has a dental appointment and she begs me to get Simi's immediately after the appointment! 
- Hey whatever makes mama happy!"}
{"text":"We couldn't decide on a place to go for dinner so decided to try this place. Our appetizers were outstanding and dinner was delicious! This is definitely on my list of best places in town. Our drinks never went over half empty. Everyone was polite and happy. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The new owners have done amazing work renovating the inside of this location.  Clean and modern, with very personable and friendly service.  The food is extremely flavorful and good portion size.  Their lunch specials are a steal and a great way taste their menu.  At the time of this review, the lunch specials were only $4.99 for a complete lunch.  The green curry was some of the best I have tasted across the country, and if you like it spicy they are not afraid to accommodate.  That is my usual complaint with Thai food.  I want it spicy, but don't worry if that is not to your taste they only spice mine up at my request.  Summer rolls have always been very fresh and refreshing.  The soups, bright and flavorful.  So far there hasn't been an entrée that my husband and I wouldn't order again.

Location on Google Maps has been wrong.  This location on the South side of Baseline, West of Lindsay Rd.  

This is a family restaurant run with family pride."}
{"text":"Whenever I come home to see my parents, we always go to Simi's, ever since they opened. Although it is not a big restaurant, you get more here than you would elsewhere.
This is a family restaurant; a couple opened this shop earlier this year, naming the restaurant after their first child, Simi. Sometimes, the man's father is the lead chef. You then know it's as authentic as it can get!
They make a fusion of Asian cuisin; from Chinese to Vietnamese. Even throw in a little Thai. They make everything very fast and if you have never tried Vietnamese broth; it's a must! 
My family of five ordered 4 dishes and we were so full afterwards. There are plenty on each plate. 
The couple is super nice and friendly. You can talk to them like they are your friends. Young couple, too! So they can relate about anything! This place should get more reviews because its new and it needs a little help. Why not give this place a try? It won't let u down. :) it hasn't for me yet!"}
{"text":"Summary:  Great Value! High Quality! Fresh! Chicken Lettuce Wraps (app), Green Curie Chicken & Pad Thai (entrees) were all 5 Star quality for the money. 

That was my wife's and my experience.  It was 1:00pm when we arrived and there and there were only 5 other customers in the café. We were politely greeted and offered a Thai Tea and Vietnamese Pressed Coffee which we jumped on. They were both great.  The service given to us from the start by this family owned restaurant was friendly, and excellent. Although it's easy to provide good service with only a couple of customers. 

We were offered a nice lunch selection from their $4.99 lunch menu which includes a soup, wonton, spring roll, and your choice of entree. Although we didn't try them that seemed like an amazing deal.  

The appetizer we had was the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps that had crispy romain lettuce, crunchy rice noodles, well seasoned ground chicken, and topped with a dollop of sweet Thai sauce that perfected the dish. 

My wife had the Pad Thai which was a classic fresh dish flavored with a good amount of authentic tamarind & fish sauce. 

My entree was the Green Curry Chicken which was on point. The sauce was a coconut milk base with curry spices that meshed well with the fresh green beans, bamboo shoots, and tarragon leaves.  The chicken was nice and tender and the dish left me 100% satisfied. 

Give this place a try and check out my photos if you need some more coaxing. ;)"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, which is rare for an Asian restaurant.  Had the pad thai, not authentic at all, strong fish sauce smell.  Portion is on the smaller side.  Will be back to try their lunch special at $4.99, wonder how much smaller the portion will be at that price, may need to order 2."}
{"text":"The food is great. There are so many great items on the menu. Diane and all the staff are wonderful. They always have a smile on their face and are so welcoming. I would highly recommend Simi's."}
{"text":"If you're looking for your next favorite place, you can stop your search here. Simi's cafe is our go-to favorite restaurant in the valley. The food here is consistently amazing, and the service is phenomenal. Coming to eat at Simi's cafe is something like going to your close family friend's house. Diane knows who we are, greets and seats us immediately, and even remembers our order. The rest of the staff is just as courteous and friendly. The pho and spicy beef soup are our favorite items on the menu. If you're new to pho, Diane will even prepare it table side for you if you ask, and they're not busy. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, you'll quickly become another one of Diane's regulars."}
{"text":"We love Simi's! If I could give it 6 stars, 10 stars, ALL THE STARS, I would! Not only is the staff amazing, the food is to die for! I have tried most things on their menu, and it's all really good. (I think the Lemon Chicken was the ONLY thing I didn't like because I'm a spice wimp.) 

I haven't eaten at the restaurant, so I can't speak to the in-house service. We usually get it to go and eat at home. This place doesn't deliver, which is usually a deal breaker for our house. Not for Simi's. We eat here most weekends, usually Friday. They are closed on Sundays, which is kind of a bummer, but I guess they need their days off, too!

Two thumbs up, five stars, 100%, A+, love it!"}
{"text":"In finality I would say my experience at Simis cafe was sublime. My treatment was that of a gladiator most decorated."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service was outstanding. Owner/manager was extremely pleasant. Water glass never got below 3/4 full.
Ok, I gave 4 stars but while on my phone after dinner she just brought a tea to enjoy while finishing my work. That gets the extra star!"}
{"text":"You won't want to pass this place up! Amazing food with even better service. We ordered the Pho and Orange Chicken and both dishes were delicious. The pictures made me think that this place was going to be pricey but it wasn't at all. The prices are super affordable and the environment is clean and very nicely decorated. They offer Vietnamese dishes as well as Chinese dishes. Don't be fooled by the outside appearance of the plaza Simis is in...this is a MUST try.. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The Pho Dec Biet was good and I will be back. I was introduced to Vietnamese food by a native Vietnamese. We went out to lunch for years and tried different places. He would compare my taste with his and my review was always dead on with his.  The summer roll (shrimp and pork) was properly made with mint not lettuce like some other places. And the pork in it was particularly tasty.

Will be back to try a seafood dish next time.

Place was clean, service was great, and I especially liked the lemonade as well."}
{"text":"Thought this restaurant would be good because of it's high rating. I ordered the calamari and it was so rubbery and in giant chunks it was unbearable to eat. Then I ordered the pho ga, because it's kind of hard to mess up that. When I got it, it smelt like dirty laundry water and the taste was worse. I'm not sure if maybe they accidentally mixed it with fish but there was definitely too many onions in it. And the chicken in it was so slimy. I also couldn't finished that. The green curry was okay but very small portion."}
{"text":"Food needed more flavor and seasoning...very blah!  I believe they rely on the fact that there is not much in the area however the service was wonderful. If only the food matched the service I would be giving more stars and going back, but unfortunately I have had better food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The service was quick and and the food was hot and amazing. We ordered via phone and had our dinner delivered in about a half hour. The orange chicken was superb. And the beef pho was very tasty. Everything we ordered was fresh and excellent. We will definitely eat from here again."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian places in Phoenix. This is the first restaurant to make me want to leave a review. The sauces for the pork and spring rolls are Perfect. I had the orange chicken and I would say its the second best I've had in Phoenix. My dad had the Kung Pao chicken and it was amazing as well. The Service was excellent and the newly renovated restaurant is great looking."}
{"text":"Location may not be the best but don't let that stop you. Great place! Clean, friendly staff and very good food!! Red curry and Thai Pad noodles delicious and fresh! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place so much. Best pho I've ever had. The Orange chicken is also amazing. All the food I've tried here has always been delicious. I love coming here, Diane and her husband(the owners) are wonderful and so nice. It's like going home and having a home cooked meal. If I could eat here every week I would."}
{"text":"The food is so good! Orange chicken is FIRE and so are the crab puffs! Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Did a sampling of menu items... I like their chicken lettuce wraps more than PF Changs. Both the veggie rolls and pork rolls were great! Fiance loved the pot stickers. Wonton soup came in a huuuge bowl! Of course, orange chicken was as amazing as everyone says. Great staff, too!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this establishment. My husband and I tried it for the first time tonight. I called and placed the order over the phone for pickup.. the man who helped me was so kind and so helpful. He told me that the orange chicken was the #1 selling dish. I had my hopes pretty high because he had spoken so highly of the orange chicken. I honestly have never had better orange chicken in my life. It was so crispy and very flavorful. I think I found my new favorite place for orange chicken."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided on Chinese the other night so I checked yelp for something new and in the area. Simi's Cafe came up and had good reviews so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant itself is clean, nicely decorated in a sort of modern IKEA sort of feel. I think the building used to be a different restaurant that had sort of a run down feel. This is much nicer. 

The staff was VERY friendly, especially our server. It was a Saturday night but only two other tables so she had plenty of time to welcome us and take our order. We decided to keep it simple. Simi's offers a variety of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes which is good. We used the Yelp coupon for the free appetizer and ordered orange chicken (my daughter is an expert) and pad Thai. 

Food came quickly. The veggie egg rolls were a disappointment. Free I know, but they were straight from Costco. The Orange Chicken was different. Paper thin slices, crispy,with sauce drizzled over them. My daughter immediately wondered if we had gotten the right food. The taste was good, but I really had to wonder if there was more breaking than chicken. The Pad Thai was good, slightly different sauce made with tamarind, and a touch of basil tossed in. Nice touch. 

Overall the food was good, better than average. Even though it wasn't busy, our server seemed overly distracted by taking phone orders, sitting with  family of customers, and ringing up take out orders.  Very pleasant place, just maybe hit it on an off night. Have to try it again."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was the best! We were treated like we were family, and told stories about our servers upbringing in China. She was sweet, attentive, and served us great food! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here with my family on a recommendation from my uncle and was very impressed. The owner/server was very friendly and knows her customers well, as she expressed her condolences for my grandma (\"Mrs. Tom's Mom\") who had passed in the previous week. The pho was quite delicious and full of flavor, which was better than some of the other pho I've had in the past. It was my mom's first time eating pho and she was blown away. I also enjoyed some of the appetizers, including the veggie rolls and summer rolls. If I lived in Arizona, I'd probably be here several times a week!"}
{"text":"We went on a slow Friday night and it was still pretty busy.   The hostess, Diane, was very nice and the service was excellent!   

We had a wide variety of entrees that we shared among the four of us.   I ordered the shrimp with snow peas, and we also had the chicken teriyaki rice bowl, and two tofu plates:  orange tofu and cashew tofu.    Both of the vegetarian plates were excellent.

This will be a place for us to get Asian food the next time we visit this area (usually once a year)."}
{"text":"Tried the Kung Pao chicken and it was a great choice. All chicken was nicely cut white meat with no gristle. Loaded up with hand cut veggies making for a nice healthy meal. The lunch special here seems to be a great route to go I recommend giving that a try if you happen to be there at the right time."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! This place is so delicious and the staff here is great. My favorite dish is the orange chicken lunch special. The beef pho is also amazing!
This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Simi's has some of the best authentic Asian food I've ever had. I live pretty close and frequent at least once a week. My normal dish is the orange chicken which is by far the best I've ever had. Their orange sauce is so sweet and delicious I could lick the plate clean. Diane is also the best! She instantly remembered my order and my name once I started coming in regularly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves good Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight...not sure where to start, the food or the atmosphere. Either way it was all great! I can't wait to sample every last item on the menu. Tonight it was the beef pho and orange chicken.  Could easily be the best in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Order for the table and share the food!  First time there so both me and my husband randomly selected off the menu.  Both of us ended up picking a soup . We ordered the Kimchi soup and the Tom Yum soup; both were excellent!"}
{"text":"The service at Simi's is at a high, high level.  Seriously good attentive people and just wonderful to deal with.  I have dined in and taken out and can't say enough about the staff.  The food is pretty great.  All around very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Wow! I saw an article about this place on yahoo saying that it was the best in the state, and man were the not kidding. The staff is extremely friendly, atmosphere is soothing, and food is phenomenal. As many have said, the Orange chicken is so delicious! No more Panda Express for me!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it the three times I've been. Tried the Pad Thai, Orange Chicken and the Spring rolls. Love all of them"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come here if you're in the mood for authentic Thai food. The food is always great and the owner is extremely friendly and comforting. We just love her!

The environment is really well put together. Clean and modern. Makes you feel safe.

One sour note is that they don't offer hot tea. The owner said they're not licensed to serve hot tea. Really?!

Besides that I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Noticed that this restaurant had changed hands yet again.  It's close to where we live so we decided to stop by for lunch one day.  First, the interior was remodeled pretty nicely.  You can tell they had a budget but I thought it was well done, very modern interior.  

Service was spectacular.  To be honest, the reason why I gave them four stars was for how nice the owners/ staff were.  You can tell that they were trying to make a good impression to new guests and it definitely worked.  We ordered off the \"lunch special\" menu.   A lot of food for five bucks.  We had chicken & vegetables and orange chicken with a chicken satay app.  The Satay was a little dry and the peanut sauce had curry in it, not what im sue to but it was ok.  The main dishes were not bad for Americanized Chinese food.  You can tell the orange glaze on the orange chicken was more of a homemade marmalade which was a nice surprise.  The crab ragoons and egg wrongs were not bad either.  I would definitely come back to try their more authentic choices such as their Pho.  I'm guessing the family is Vietnamese so i should try to stick those items on the menu.

Overall we will be back.  Best of luck to them."}
{"text":"I was craving pho for my birthday so we happened upon Simi's Cafe. It is located in a strip mall, but as we entered the restaurant, it was as though we were being transformed to a different place. I loved the interior design, the red cushion wall is very inviting and tasteful. It made me feel like I was somewhere in Asia.

We ordered fresh spring rolls and 2 bowls of pho. I found everything to be very fresh and tasty. We are both big critics of pho so we were quite pleased with the broth quality. We didn't order anything else, but there is a very extensive menu of other Asian food, mostly Chinese dishes.

The owner came by to chat with us. She was very welcoming and inviting. That's one of my favorite things about independent businesses, getting to know the owners, especially when you can tell how appreciative they are of your presence. Will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. The service is excellent and the restaurant itself is always so consistent and clean. The main food in Simi's is perfectly cooked and seasoned beautifully. What I have been so obsessed with lately is the beautiful poke. The Poke  bar is filled with color and fresh ingredients. My favorite is the spicy tuna and shrimp (pictured below) try the spicy mayo as well.
Thank you Simi's for being so friendly and fresh every single time!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday the food absolutely blew my mind 

Try the beef soup amazing will return"}
{"text":"Still one of our favorite places. Summer rolls are the bomb, and the pho  is very good. They're fantastic with children and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"AMAZING ORANGE CHICKEN. We wanted to order the pad thau, but when I asked about it and they said, \"We think it's good\", I got nervous and went with the recommended black pepper chicken. Way too spicy and the veggies aren't done enough. But good atmosphere, friendly to-go service and excellent steamed rice."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last week based on the Yelp reviews. The service was excellent.  We were seated, orders taken, and food delivered very quickly. My one complaint is that they don't allow substitutions on the lunch menu.  I am a vegetarian and wanted tofu substituted for meat but they won't do it.  I could find only one entrée with tofu on the main menu, but decided to just go with the vegetables and rice on the lunch menu.  It was good, but I've had better.  I doubt we will be returning only because we have found other Chinese/Asian restaurants that we like much more."}
{"text":"I noticed all the 5 star ratings for this place and decided to go give it a try myself. We now understand why it gets such great reviews. The staff understands Customer Service perfectly and makes you feel like family. The food is excellent and can be customized to anyway you like it. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Poki bar is so yummy, like eating a bowl of sushi and the staff is very friendly. A gem!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend it, in the outside does not look nice, but in the inside is decent. FOOD is DELISOUS I recommend it. I have some picky eater kids and they loved it. The house fried rice is one of my best if you LOVE rice. I have been looking for a place since we moved from California to Arizona and we found it! Unexpansive as well and the food is fresh and HOT! 

 THE PLUS IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  SUPER NICE!"}
{"text":"Pho-nomenal! The best orange chicken I've ever had - and this is not your typical breading laden soggy chicken - light, crisp, perfection! The best part, in addition to great service, is the menu - from Thai to Pho to Chinese - everything is amazing. You won't regret a visit here; in fact, I guarantee you'll be back."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because of service and convenience of online ordering.  The pho was acceptable and the lunch specials are decent sized with good prices. I didn't give it a full 5 stars only because they don't serve Siracha sauce with their pho which is a MUST (they give the seeded chili sauce instead, which takes away from the authenticity of pho).  I would definitely still come here for my pho fix because they're right down the street and I have my own bottle of Siracha :)"}
{"text":"Simi's is my absolute go-to for Pho. Never disappoints. Staff is attentive and food is delicious and fresh. Diane is the one I believe that runs the place and she is always around engaging with customers and making sure everyone is happy and satisfied. We go quite often and I will continue going! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The BEST orange chicken I've had in a long time. And coming from Hawaii I know my Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Amazing service in this place as it is owner operated.  I also loved their spring rolls which I could make a meal out of alone.  Their Pho Ga was a little on the bland side I found sadly otherwise I would be there all the time.  The rest of the food we had was very good and very fresh.  This place cares about their food and their customers."}
{"text":"Went here with my Vietnamese in-laws, they were very happy with the food and so was I. We took advantage of the check in and got very yummy veggie rolls. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Our service was great! Our waitress was so informative and kind and very attentive. We had their pho and it tasted wonderful, my only concern was that there was hardly any meat in it. I wished there was more. The price was right and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the East Valley.

Consistently great food lunch and dinner.

Amazing service and friendly engaging servers.

The seafood Pad Thai so fresh and delicious.

Generous portions and reasonable prices.

I overheard other patrons planning their visit!

So good you forget to take pictures."}
{"text":"Every time we go in, we are treated like old friends.  The food is really tasty, and the portions were large."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Asian food in this part of the country...so I didn't really have high hopes for this place. It was right next to my next work appointment which made it convenient enough. I got in there around 1 -2pm for a late lunch. 

Food: 
They were out of Pho =(
I ordered what I typically order to test the skill of the chef. I ordered a Chow Fun.
Chicken Chow Fun - It wasn't too greasy, didn't clump, and had a good balance of flavor. I approve. Not the best but definitely not bad. 

Service: 
Friendly staff. Owners work hands on as well. They seem to know half the customers walking in. 

Environment: 
Very pseudo Asian design in here...like the stuff you see on TV. I actually felt like I was sitting in an Asian porn set. Not that I know what an Asian porn set looks like....but...ok...nevermind...

Price: 
Well priced for the type of food. Honestly if they raised their prices...people would still come because there is not much else nearby. 

Food: 4
Service: 4
Environment: 2
Price: 4"}
{"text":"I can always tell that I'm getting sick if I start craving Pho... since we've moved we wanted to try a new place and so we went over to Simi's Cafe.

Diane was our server and you could tell that she was a good one... very helpful with recommendations and engaging. Very friendly to our 3 year old... and she's one of those that remembers people who've been in before. When I mentioned that we'd never been before and asked what was good... her immediate response was, \"Oh, I know... and you should try x, y and z.\"

The food was pretty damn good... my gal and I had beef pho, the boy prince had fried rice and we ordered a side of chicken show mein to share. All of it was good, quick, and solid.

With regards to the atmosphere... the place was pretty full, which was a good sign... with both gringos and asian folks...! Haha

Finally with regards to value, the pricing was really pretty good... less than $10 per dish, and it was tasty.

We'll definitely be back... and while it's not the best in town... it's certainly worth my recommendation if you're looking for solid Vietnamese/Chinese food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Just tried it this last week and had to come back a 2nd time because of how good the food was!  Very affordable and the food comes out fresh and fast!  The Mongolian beef and pho beef soup were both fantastic! Give this place a try and it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went here for date night tonight and had a lovely time!

Atmosphere: nice, clean and simply decorated. It's medium size and there's nothing particularly special but it feels comfortable and inviting. 

Staff: they were extremely helpful with menu choices and were friendly. Our waitress went out of her way to make sure the food was perfect and we had enough spicy sauce. Very friendly!

Food: we ordered Thai tea, pork spring rolls, chicken pad Thai and twice cooked pork. The Thai teas were sweet and refreshing, it was nice to try something new! The egg rolls were good, hot and crunchy. The pad Thai was fantastic!!! It had so much flavor, my taste buds were dancing! The basil gave it an extra zing. My boyfriend really really likes spicy food, so for him the pork wasn't spicy enough but I thought it was great!

We will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! I have been eating here for years. The customer service is consistently awesome. The owners are kind and the food is delicious. Top Notch!"}
{"text":"Simi is such a sweetheart!! I've been here twice now and she's been a gem from the moment I stepped in the gym. I had the Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup the first time. The soup was good! A little salty but nothing too bad. Definitely had an adequate number of wontons and noodles. The chicken pot stickers were fried and good too. This time I got the lunch special, available for $6! Whaaaa"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from Simi's tonight for dinner after receiving recommendation from a friend. We ordered the yellow curry, orange chicken, and an order of pork spring rolls, and summer rolls. All of it was fantastic!! Will definitely be ordering takeout from Simi's cafe again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. I highly recommended it. There lunch special can not be beat."}
{"text":"LOVED this!!!!  the wait staff was so friendly, the food was sublime!  Everything looked fantastic, I have told many about Simi's"}
{"text":"New to the area and we decided to try this place and so glad we did. The service was awesome they were very friendly and helpful. the egg rolls they were flavorful, the fried rice was soft and tasty, but I really enjoyed the poke. It was cold fresh and made to serve. Limited on topping but very good."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing the other reviews.  Received a pleasant greeting from the hostess as soon as we entered.  The premises are very clean and the staff is genuinely friendly.  Service was quick and very attentive.  I ordered Pho and the wife ordered Chicken Pad Thai.  The Pho is doubtless the best to be had in the East Valley, perfectly seasoned, and a large serving.  Pad Thai is prepared the proper way with Tamarind and Fish Sauce.  It can be made spicy on request.  It was very flavorful and again, a generous serving.  Pricing is very inexpensive considering the size of the portions and the service we received.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is great and service is amazing. Pho is always really good and Thom Yum is just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers are the best and so is the food! Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a fresh meal."}
{"text":"Oh man!!! This place is amazing!!! Just went there for the first time last night. We had been putting it off, because it's located in a ugly old stop mall, so again, DONT JUDGE A RESTAURANT BY ITS COVER!!! Once you open the door, it is a really nicely laid out restaurant. The hostess was super nice and very attentive. Their menu is simple, without having 100 different dishes. I HIGHLY recommend this little restaurant. I had the pork chow mien and pot stickers, no need for soy sauce, the food wasn't oily or overly seasoned. Meat was tender, and cooked properly. I absolutely will be going back, without hesitation!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and already love it. Very friendly hostess, and very nice ambient. The food portion is pretty big and tastes really good. 
Definitely will recommend this place to everyone and I am coming back here more often for sure."}
{"text":"I have had beef Pho all over the US and this is one of the best!  Great summer rolls,also.  Place is modern and very clean.  Everyone is friendly and service is quick!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Gilbert. Great lunch specials. Try the orange chicken! Very friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"First time eating pho. Delicious. Had the one with dumplings. Service was phenomenal. Just wish they served alcohol too but made for a cheap dinner date!"}

{"text":"I started going to Simi's just a couple of months ago, but I've already taken several  people there for lunch who are also sold on this place. Diane is all about giving great service and assuring that you enjoy your meal. And the food is very good and very fresh. She remembers me by name and my order every time and makes me feel at home. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place SO many times and finally tried it tonight for the 1st time. Got it to go....pot stickers...pork fried rice and  beef noodle soup. Everything was really good!! Definitely going to be back! If u are driving by it ...stop!! You will be glad you do!"}
{"text":"I like it a lot.  No fake sauces.  See the owners working hard, great flavor, great spirit, spend less than panda express, and enjoi..."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service amazing food and nice atmosphere. Very clean and well kept. I recommend the orange chicken and the beef pho."}
{"text":"The food is great. The menu has variety. The restaurant is very clean and the owners and employees are always super nice as well as attentive. Your glass is always full and they remember you when you come back months later."}
{"text":"Good food and lunch price is awesome.  They hardly speak with you unless they recognize you from many times before but if poor customer service in that area bothers you then you might not want to go however if you just want a good lunch then I would recommend it.  I just wouldn't drive over 10 minutes to get there if you had to.  Very local place."}
{"text":"Everything has been good, but if I must highlight one think I will say I get hankerings for their chicken lettuce wraps. If you have never had Vietnamese coffee, PLEASE order that! Great things are worth the wait, and I got to watch it steep and drip slowly out of this mini metal coffee filter over the glass mug with some cream on the bottom that I'm not totally sure what it was. Diane, the owner is the sweetest person ever, she is usually our server too."}
{"text":"I lived in Tucson for 5 years and I had a favorite place to get pho. When I moved back home,  I struggled to find somewhere in the East Valley with pho. This place not only had pho but it is also so amazing! Great pho, egg rolls, and curry! The staff is also so friendly and always provide great service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The food is amazing I had the cashew chicken & my wife had the Pho. We both had Chi Tea & we got two free veggie rolls which were great too. I can't say enough good things about the food. The service was better than some 5 star restaurants I've been to. I'm pretty sure our order was taken by the owner or manager who talked to us like old friends & began a conversation about the iPad he was using to take our order. I hope they open one of these right next to my house because I'd eat there everyday."}
{"text":"Diane is the best worker here; super friendly and personable... we just love seeing her every time we come! The look and atmosphere of the restaurant is superb. The pho is delicious and full of flavor! We have tried their orange chicken which is great and flavorful, but the chicken pieces are a bit on the thin side... I wish they were thicker. The chow mein and fried rice is great but I've had better. Overall I highly recommend this place for the pho, atmosphere, and Diane!!"}
{"text":"I travel to Asia quite a bit and this place is pretty authentic. The food is great, and the service is fantastic. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Simi's Cafe was a wonderful experience; we went there for the lunch special and pho.  Both were exceptionally delicious.  The pho was well-prepared and was a large portion.  The lunch special kung pao chicken was a great portion and the sauce was on par.  The chicken chow mein was also very tasty.  For the $4.99 that you pay for the egg roll, crab rangoon, soup, and entree, you get your money's worth and every ounce is delectable.  Above all else was the service: from the moment we walked in to our departure, we felt well taken care of by our hosts. I will definitely be revisiting Simi's Cafe for the service that would remind you of going to a close friend's house and for the delicious food that I can't get enough of."}
{"text":"It is easy to miss this place - it's not signed well and blends in with a dull, tan strip mall that looks deserted. However, give this place a shot! 5 stars! The server was awesome, peppy, accommodating and jolly! The food was plentiful, fresh and delightful. The inside of the restaurant is remodeled and OK."}
{"text":"First trip to Simi's.  Everyone was extremely friendly and ready to please. EXCELLENT. Food was pretty good.  Will go back again to try their other items. Great place."}
{"text":"First time here and we were not disappointed. We will definitely return. I enjoyed the Mongolian beef and my husband had kung pao chicken. Both were excellent and the staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the sweet and sour pork, Mongolian beef, potstickers, and edd flower soup... all amazing. Only thing is if you order appetizer, wait till your eating appetizers to order entrees. They bring all the food out so quick, u have to rush eating the appetizers to make sure your entree doesn't get cold. This place will not disappoint you! Great sauces and meat."}
{"text":"I'm a regular patron of this local establishment. The owners are very accommodating to our usual large group. Diane is so sweet and will take care of you like family. They will customize the food if needed too and enjoy making suggestions of what to try. Every entree is made fresh!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I agree that this is our favorite asian cuisne in the valley...so far. The staff is always so curtious and friendly and recognize us everytime we come in. The food is always great and the service just makes it 100x better."}
{"text":"So amazed by the food, service and pricing here.  recommend if you're looking for a delicious bite to eat AND not break the bank"}
{"text":"Ok first time here and the over all experience was very good. First off I was greeted by a very pleasant and courteous woman who seemed very friendly. I came here specifically for Vietnamese cuisine. I ordered cha gio and pho dac biet. Cha gio was good but the nuoc mam (dipping sauce) was too fish saucy just needed a bit more sugar and vinegar or lime juice. The pho dac biet was good. My only complaint is that it had to much clove. But these are just my opinions and preferences. Give this place a try! I can not say enough about the friendly service. It is a very inviting place and should be given a chance by anyone who loves Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Best pho in the valley in my opinion. Not only is the food amazing the service is as well. The way they cook their chicken for the soup is so yummy and warms you right up. 

Diane is beyond sweet and always calls me by name when I come in and my family as well. She is so hard working and always so kind. She takes time to get to know you and truly cares for you. 

When I first went I had a difficult time talking to one of the waitresses and felt she was rude but now realize it was a language barrier and neither one of us were communicating well with each other. Since I took the time to talk to her she is so sweet and I don't feel that way anymore. 

I HIGHLY recommend Simi's Cafe and their food!!!!"}
{"text":"I brought our whole family here to experience Thai cuisine.  We were warmly greeted by Diane in a very comfortable seating area. She helped us find options for our gluten free needs. Diane went above and beyond when our son did not favor his first dish and she generously sent us home with summer rolls free of charge. 

Why you need to visit: The service is impeccable and attentive with dishes of flavorful medleys."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly staff, great crab rangoons!  Ordered them and summer rolls to go - love how fresh everything tasted.  Ambience was nice and relaxed.  Would definitely go back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting Simi's and I have to say this cafe its a great little place to eat! I made a take out order for me and my coworkers' lunch. We had spring rolls, summer rolls, and lettuce wraps. 

It took about 15 minutes and that was even after I added another order of spring rolls on my way to the restaurant. The spring rolls were a good size and came with plenty of lettuce. The summer rolls were really good too, but they did not come with the peanut sauce that I am used to eating them with :/ I liked the lettuce wraps as well; they give you a good size portion and its nice to have something for lunch that isn't so heavy. 

Overall, this restaurant is clean, quiet, and the servers are very attentive and sweet. 
I can't wait to order from here again to try out the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo delicious!!!! Their dine in only lunch specials are perfect! Perfectly portioned and perfectly priced. For their lunch menu you can never go wrong with their teriyaki chicken. For their dinner menu I enjoy the garlic chicken stir fry. My mouth is watering as I am typing this all out. The service is always super friendly and she even knows us by name even though we don't come all that often. :)
Give Simi's Cafe a try! If you're taste buds don't like the first dish, go back and try something different."}
{"text":"I have now been to Simi's about 5 times and feel I can give a review. 

Simi's is truly wonderful. This is the most friendly family run place. Every time I've gone in they have remembered and recognized me,  which shows they actually pay attention and care. I've often been offered a free drink while waiting etc. 

I have tried multiple meals there but the star to me that cannot be resisted is the orange chicken. It is by far the best orange chicken anywhere. All the food is delicious. You can't go wrong with the service and food. A must if you're craving Asian food"}
{"text":"Their orange chicken lunch dish was really good but when I came back to try the pad Thai it wasn't good. So with this restaurant it's like a hit or miss with mostly hits and a few misses."}
{"text":"Wow. Second time in. This is an awesome Mesa find!!  The food is so clean and fresh service quick and super friendly."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Simi's Cafe for almost 3 years now and Diane knows me by name. When I call in my order, she knows it's me and she knows what I'm going to order.  When we pick up our food, she is kind to my kids, gives them some lollipops and asks me how I've been. Seriously great family owned restaurant.

They've recently added a poki bar and I had my first bowl tonight.  My poki bowl was delicious and fresh. Not a lot of poki places on the east side so it's great to have something close to home. 

If you haven't tried this place, you should give it a try. We'll be coming back... :)"}
{"text":"The absolute best orange chicken we've ever had. Love the crabpuffs, spring rolls and popping lychee Boba too! The staff are super friendly and always remember you. I have absolutely nothing bad to say, except that I wish they were closer to home. My husband drives out from Chandler regularly to pick up some orange chicken for us and we'll bring the family for lunch when we're out this way!"}
{"text":"My wife an I came here after finding the place on Yelp. I wasn't very optimistic because the exterior of the restaurant was a little bland. Once we got inside the experience started. The staff was overly nice extremely helpful, they offered suggestions from the menu. We ordered the spring rolls(veggie) and the pot stickers (chicken). The main entree. I ordered the red curry chicken. It came out with a side of rice which by it self was great. The curry was amazing with the perfect amount of chicken and veggies. My wife ordered the orange chicken. The plate size was huge and it too was served with a side of rice. all the food smelled amazing and tasted even better. The staff was so nice that I would love to go back just to chat with them. I had better service in the 45min meal then most of my life. I will be back, and I will recommend them to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This place was super delious the food we got was really good and fresh and the staff was excellent very friendly and nice I definitely recommend this place I will come back for more :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Simi's a few times and will definitely return.  Their summer rolls are very good.  The owners are awesome and the food is fresh.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic. Great service and prices! Loved it!  Ordered the Thai tea and it was delicious. The kimchi pho was my hubby's choice and he loved it. I had the chicken pho and it was very tasty. Too much to finish!  We will come back!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! They are just finishing an expansion and cant wait to go back. I order the same thing every time, no need to order something different when it has been perfected! BEEF PHO !!!! 
Sometimes I will add Summer Rolls or Eddamame. Great for to go orders and dine in orders! Staff is overly friendly and nice! Thanks Keep up the AWESOME work!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my girlfriend, and we were very pleased with our meal. We had potstickers and spring rolls to start, then Pad Thai, and yellow curry chicken. Both were very tasty. If I had any criticism, it could have been more spicy."}
{"text":"Their Pho is amazing, but so is everything else on the menu. I'm a fan of the Vietnamese Coffee and their crab puffs. A true gem, very clean and modern inside. Stop in for a great lunch deal."}
{"text":"Had summer rolls and pho and they were both delicious. The owner was very kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't often write reviews.  I've been visiting Simi's Cafe for a while now I have been meaning to write a review of my experiences.

Here goes...I love Simi's.  I have an awesome experience every single time I take my family to have Pho.  We have tried other dishes while visiting but my favorite is the beef Pho.  

The service is always super attentive.  The waitress always makes sure our meal is exactly to our liking.  She always makes sure our glasses our full and is quick to bring our food when it is ready for our table.  

I heartily recommend Simi's Cafe.  It is a locally owned restaurant and it's nice to be able to help a place that cares about customers and service and food.

Go and try it.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once. I decided to try it out because of all the good reviews. The appetizers and food were delicious! Definitely 5 stars. The waitresses were friendly and provided good service. The place is easy to miss and I have driven by it so many times and never stopped because it doesn't look all that appealing on the outside...it's very plain.  But, the food is so worth it. Will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have searched all over the valley for good fried rice and this is the place! We highly recommend their BBQ pork fried rice. If you like it spicy, upon request they will make it spicy when frying in the wok which infuses the spice throughout the dish for a much different taste than adding Sriracha at the table. The crab puffs are delicious! The spring rolls are yummy! I'm addicted to their regular ice tea. The atmosphere inside is very clean with just the right amount of modern Asian flare. If you are not satisfied with anything Diane will do anything in her power to make it right and she is full of suggestions based on your taste which you can tell comes from her genuine passion of food and customer service. Overall the portions are very generous and the personalized customer service from Diane is one of a kind that you won't find anywhere else. My only regret is that I didn't find this hidden gem sooner! Go give Simi's a try. You won't regret it! :o)"}
{"text":"Prices are very good for lunch, $5.95 but don't expect much chicken.  The flavors were good and amount of food plentiful.  My husband enjoyed his fried rice.  The kao Pao chicken was also good with veggies and peanuts.  They made it medium spicy for me.  Service was friendly and prompt.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The service here is just inexplicable. Every person who works here is happy, smiling, and completely attentive to everyone that walks in. You can tell by the way they greet and speak to people on the phone and when they walk in that customer service is a priority. Oh and for the food... it was delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously THE BEST Chinese food in all of Arizona! The orange chicken (what I ordered) had actual orange peel in it-so you know it's authentic! Fabulous food, amazing customer service, and always exceptionally clean!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few times when Yelp glowing reviews meant nothing to me. I strongly suspect that reviews for this restaurant are fixed. This place may earn solid 3 stars on a good day.

I was in such disbelief that I came back to Yelp and found some negative reviews for this place. People are absolutely right - Pad Thai is so bland and unappealing (check other peoples photos), and their Tom Yum was a weird substance with plenty of mushrooms. It smelled so strange I could not even force myself to try it. Best pho??? You have to be kidding me. It was the worst pho I have ever tried in my life - very bland.

To add an insult to the injury they brought Tom Yum and our 2 main dishes at the same time. Who does that? I thought they forgot about my soup, but no, they brought it 5 minutes later. I asked a waiter if they were about to close soon (it was lunch time), but she cheerfully announced that they were open until late and then added that we had plenty of time to finish our meals. Then why did you bring it all together??? My mother cannot leave food, she has a notion that if it is paid for and somewhat edible she should finish her meal. She also wanted to take a doggy bag (though I would not feed this meal to any dogs, I think better of them). Anyway, after we mentioned that we would need a box 2 different waiters approached us 2 times each =4 times all together in a span of 10 minutes asking if we were ready for them to pack it. Honestly, if not for my mother, I would have left a while ago and no, I would not have taken any of this mediocrity with me - I do not have any problem leaving bad food even if I have to pay for it. Waiters were polite, but lacked any coordination with each other. I guess because I was sitting and staring at my mom while she was eating, they assumed that they needed to offer to pack food 4 times. How about you offer to refill my glass of ice tea at least once? Overall, I am very disappointed. $46 down the drain. I am also very suspicious of these glowing reviews. There is no way real people would consider it to be even remotely worthy of 3 stars, and many people are giving 5. Obviously, I would never return."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I stopped in for lunch at 1pm on a Wednesday and there was ample seating. I was a little apprehensive since it had so many 5 star reviews on Yelp, I thought there would be more people over the lunch hour. I got the Kung Pao and asked for it extra spicy. They must've thought I was kidding because it wasn't very spicy. The lunch special came with a bowl of soup, a crab puff (crab Rangoon everywhere else), and a vegetable spring roll. All were very good. The value for the price was outstanding - $6.50! I will definitely be back as I work in this area often and I will be recommending to my friends and co-workers.

One other bonus was the number of people the wait staff knew by name and that were there on a recommendation from either the person they were sitting with or from someone they knew. Great little place worth a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the Pho is awesome. They also have vegetarian option with a veggie broth and lots of vegetables. Super friendly and great service. I just stumbled upon it one day, but go back frequently when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent friendly service. The pho was delicious as was the yellow curry and orange chicken."}
{"text":"Chicken entrees are really really good. Can't wait to go back and have more of their other Asian meals. My neighbor really loves their food as well"}
{"text":"My husband and i have been coming here for a while and the food is always amazing! Diane always makes us feel at home and makes sure we have everything we need.

Orange chicken is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. We had orange chicken and Pho. Both were pronominal. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is so good and the customer service here is wonderful, they actually care about you and things in your life. Coming here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"I did not particularly enjoy my meal here, but on the other hand, it was not bad.  Hence the three stars.  The food was OK and average at best.  The minced chicken lettuce wraps were good.  The fried tofu with vegetables were good and plentiful.  The calamari with chilis were good too.  All the food was seasoned alright but could have been a little more spicy.  But for the average American palate, I guess it was seasoned OK.  We also ordered an order of chicken satay which was a huge disappointment....don't ever order this dish here.  It was three skewers of chicken meat fried in a frying pan with no flavoring; and they do not have Thai peanut sauce to accompany it, although the menu says it does.  What a disappointment.

The place also was very cold.  The inside temperature was about 68 degrees and they have no booths, only small tables.

I don't think I will return for another meal, with so many other Asian restaurants with better food."}
{"text":"I ordered seafood chow fun, it is surprisingly good!!! The summer roll is on point!!! I love everything here. The service is nice and friendly. I recommend everyone who love Asian food to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest Hidden Gem in Gilbert. They make the Best Pho soup ever! Another one of my favorites is the orange chicken. It is so delicious as is all of the food at Simi. Service is always five star!!!"}
{"text":"In really getting a sense of other Chinese restaurants in the area I need to update my review. 

Yes the service is incredible but I wouldn't say the Chinese or Vietnamese food is the best.  It is slightly Americanized and the portions are smaller than the other restaurants in the East Valley.  This is from my own mom's tastebuds who is Chinese and knows all the good authentic Chinese places in the Valley. 

Their Pho broth is still very good but they don't have a large Vietnamese food selection and their other dishes are still a little smaller than I'm used too. 

Is it still worth checking out? Yes.  Would I bring my parents here? No."}
{"text":"Delicious food every time once you order the food does come out quickly I think the owner is a little overwhelmed trying to do most of the stuff herself but she keeps a great attitude and is always friendly I recommend this place to anybody looking for decent Vietnamese / Chinese food in the Mesa Gilbert area super affordable good portions and my kids love the Pho"}
{"text":"I visited today because of all the great reviews. I was disappointed. Simis is not worth 4 1/2 stars. First it looks dirty and scruffy. Inside is OK. The lunch menu is a bargain, but the food was barely average. There are lots of Asian restaurants with better food and they dont look as sketchy as this one. Not worth the ratings."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times in the last 6 months. Every time the food has been absolutely the best. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The prices are excellent and did I mention the food is always great? I rarely make recommendations, but I highly recommend Simi's."}
{"text":"This is my second visit, and it was as good as the first.  Place is run by a young, local couple, along with help from their family members.  The menu has excellent variety, the servers are pleasant and attentive.  The food is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable.  I am so thrilled to have found this little treasure!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is fantastic! Super friendly staff with great recommendations. We ordered the chicken chow fun, salt and pepper beef, and orange chicken and followed our waitress's advice on adding some extra spice to it. The food was delicious! The best I've had in AZ. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Stopped by as Yelp reviews were very good.  I placed an order to go after arriving.  The owner gave me a bowl of soup and drink while I was waiting for my order.  In all the years I have been ordering Chinese food, no one has ever done that.  As I looked around this is a simple, mall styled restaurant.  Nothing fancy, just great food and unbelievable great service.  When  I got home, our food was everything I hoped it to be.  Just perfect."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was excited. However, this was some of the most bland food I have ever tasted. I only have two stars because the staff was nice. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"We were in the area and saw this on Yelp. The food was great and the service was on point. My water was constantly refilled. :) They were out of the eggplant I wanted, so ordered beef with broccoli instead. The meat was tender and delicious. If ever I'm in the area again, I'll be sure to hit this place up again."}
{"text":"So, I'm now a regular at this place. The food keeps me walking thru the door, the DELIGHT that is the service here keeps me So happy while I'm here and the prices make it a pleasure to leave bc I don't feel too broke. 
The orange chicken is still the crowd favorite but some newcomer menu faves are the beef pho (gave it another try and glad I did, much better eaten at the restaurant), pepper chicken, pork chow fun, pork fried rice, chicken lettuce wrap, and garlic chicken. Also, my kids are strangely obsessed with Hong Kong beef noodle soup. Honestly, this place is an absolute gem. 
Diane noticed I came in with my kids tonight and spent a great deal of time and care with us, even rolling up my 5 yr olds sleeves so the soy sauce wouldn't stain. 
Lovely food, great prices and the most genuine service I've EVER encountered."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only is the food great but the customer service is like none other...

I ordered the 5 dollar orange chicken lunch after seeing the great reviews. The lady at the bar that took my order was incredibly professional and pleasant. She offered me a water while I waited for my food (maybe 7 mins) which was a pleasant surprise. She handed my order to me and told me to enjoy my lunch. :) super sweet. 
I really appreciate businesses that take the time to give a sh*t about their customers, not just the $$$$. 

Simi's orange chicken is nothing like your local Panda Express the chicken is perfectly fried and sweetened with their amazing orange sauce. Crab puff and veggie roll were both very tasty. 

***WARNING*** if you are starving at lunch and order the lunch special you may be a tad disappointed because this is a true \"lunch\" portion. Which is expected since it's only 5 bucks. I wasn't famished so this size was perfect-o!!

The decor is extremely cute and I love that you can actually see into the kitchen from the bar. Everything looks clean and well kept. Can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Both the beef chow fun wide noodle, and the mixed vegetable with lightly fried tofu, were excellent. The noodle dish was among the best I've had, which was portioned just right for three hungry people, and was free of any excess oil. The vege dish was a colorful medley of quality freshness and variety. Combined with quick and friendly service, I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"We love Simi's!!!  The food is always fresh and delicious and the service is fantastic!!  We eat here regularly since our daughter dances at the ballet studio next door. The orange chicken tastes like candy and the calamari is a must!  Highly recommend for some many reasons."}
{"text":"Great place!!! It's right around the corner from me, the service is unbeatable. I have been a few times and I have to say the green curry is amazing but very hot! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for friendly service, a calm atmisphere, and some really great dishes."}
{"text":"The people working here are amazing, very friendly and attentive. I didn't wait too long for food, and everything was so delicious! I highly recommend this place, and will be sharing with my friends too."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while, I drive by all of the time.  We got a coupon in the mail so decided to give it a try.

We started with the summer rolls with peanut sauce- they were fresh and tasty.

There were many choices so it was hard to decide what to get but we decided to go with their house specialties.

My husband, who likes things spicy, ordered the red curry chicken.  He loved it, plenty spicy and such a big serving he couldn't eat it all.

I had the sliced beef Pho-  it was just delicious and is made by the owner's father in law.  It takes 10 hours to cook and has a hint of cinnamon.  The broth was amazing.

The service was friendly and helpful and the food came out very quickly.  Can't wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"First: don't let the outside appearance throw you off. We almost didn't go inside because it looks so sketchy outside, but the inside is very nice, clean, and looks newly renovated.

Second: I normally don't like pho places, but my wife does and she needed a pick me up. I was pleasantly surprised. They had some non-pho menu items. The kung pao chicken was very good, nice portion for a cheap lunch special. The free veggie spring rolls that came with my Yelp check-in were very good (I normally don't like spring rolls), and tasted freshly made instead of pre-frozen. The crab puffs rocked.

Service was fast and polite."}
{"text":"Just tried Simi's,  found it on local flavor.  Really enjoyed the food, can't wait to go back to try something different (I had cashew shrimp, delish!)
Customer service was awesome.  Don't need any coupon, the prices are so reasonable and portions are generous.   
Go now!!"}
{"text":"Chicken soup awesome! Honk Kong  soup awesome! FANTASTIC food and great service!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food! Reasonable prices for the amount of food sms quality of food.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Om nom nom... So good. If you're a fan of pho, these guys do it traditional style. No msg in the broth,  just a quality family recipe using good ingredients cooked for over 8 hours. Don't believe me,  try the broth BEFORE you put sriracha and hoisin in it. If that doesn't convince you,  just take note how you feel after drinking it.  Normally I get super dehydrated from the sodium and have to pound a bunch of water, not here.  Can't wait to sample the rest of their menu. I'll update my review when I get a chance to go back.  Oh btw, Alan who is father/chef wants to show us what GOOD Asian food is like... Not this panda crud (my words,  not his) or buffet slop."}
{"text":"Service and food are always top notch.  It's really hard to beat this for a neighborhood Chinese place.  We are always super impressed by the quality of the ingredients that you get.  While you can definitely find more daring (authentic) chinese food in west mesa/chandler, this place hits the spot for those simply chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT. 

Don't shy away from the plain exterior. Great little place, very nice atmosphere!

Terrific food, super friendly service, and s delicious Thai  tea. 1st time here, and we'll be back, for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The best Asian food in the valley. Diane will treat you well! I recommend the beef chow fun and orange chicken. I have never had a bad meal here. The lunch specials are very affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside of  this place. The food is Amazing ! And the inside is super cute! The food  has a special touch! The owners are so Welcoming we have an A+ experience every time. My kids constantly ask to go here. The pho is Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean, looks cool, and you can't get much better than 4.99 for crab puff, veggie spring roll, soup and your meal. They also have boba drinks and Thai tea, which we love. 
It doesn't look like much on the outside (ghetto strip mall) but it really is awesome. The orange chicken is really crispy, so be ready for something a little different than you're used to with OC. The veggie spring rolls are delcious, but the Egg drop soup was eh. 
I will be coming here a lot in the future for lunch. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant and they just added a poki bar that is soooo good!
Great family run restaurant awesome service too!
I can't say enough good things just go try it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and amazing food. I can speak for the chicken pho, orange chicken and seafood panfried noodles....all were Amazing! Good portion sizes and attentive servers will keep bringing us back. Place was clean, modern and kid friendly...nice for couples or if flying solo you wont be disappointed. Servers were on top of everything from refills to making sure we enjoyed our meal. You have to give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Their poke bowl was AMAZING! Ping helped me out and was a pleasure to talk to! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the service the portions were good! I loved the taste of the chow mein. I would highly recommend if your close by try them out!!"}
{"text":"Hmm, apparently I'm in the minority with my review here but I was less than impressed. 

Stopped in for lunch for pho ga (chicken pho).  Ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Diet Coke was flat, I tried to let the server know that they needed to check the carbonation but she wasn't understanding me so I told her I would have water instead.

Pho came out quickly.  I asked for 1) a spoon (yes, need a spoon for the broth, thanks), 2) for cilantro and onions.  I got what would amount to about 1 sprig of cilantro and some green onions.  Realized after I got the smidgen of cilantro that they hadn't served the side of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, etc on the side... At this point I will just have to make do.

Younger server came to check on me so I ask her for more cilantro as well as jalapenos/limes (which would normally have already been served on the side).  She explains that they don't bring the veggies with the \"chicken noodle soup\" because there are already veggies in the soup and most people don't eat the sprouts, etc.  Fair enough, I usually don't eat the sprouts either, but I always use the limes and jalapenos and lots of cilantro so please bring me some, thank you.

Out she comes with more cilantro (more than a sprig which was nice) and jalapenos.  No lime though.  I've given up at this point and used the lime from my water.

After adding the cilantro, jalapeno and watery lime, the pho was much better (pretty bland otherwise) and it satisfied my pho craving, but can't say that I'll be back in the future, at least not for pho.  

I know this is a lot of detail and maybe sounds a little picky for just a bowl of soup, but honestly, pho is not that complicated and certain things are just standard and they didn't deliver those \"standards\" here.

The decor was very nice and the second server really did try to make me happy, but all in all there other places I much prefer."}
{"text":"This is a very popular restaurant in Mesa. Arrive early or be prepared for a wait here. The service is very fast and efficient. Once you have ordered the dishes start arriving very soon, so keep up. The variety of soups and rice plates is amazing and it is made fresh. The service here is very good and they will walk you through the whole process and advise you what is special and how much they think you need.Good food and GREAT service."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! The owner is super nice and very attentive. The Phó is good. Limited options in terms of meat toppings. No tendon or tripe. Just the rare beef. However they don't use MSG, so that's a big plus. Wonton soup is tasty as well, the meat filling is very well seasoned and not over cooked. Portions and price are very reasonable as well. Can't go wrong with this place if you got a hankering for good Vietnamese food. Plus they make slushies!"}
{"text":"Dinner with a party of nine.  The service was excellent. The were quick and attentive. 
The food was fast and plates were big. We tried 7 different dishes and the family thought the peppered beef was the hit.
The orange beef was the second choice. Of you are looking for a family friendly place to eat, give Simi's a try."}
{"text":"The hospitality and food is amazing here! 

The owners Diane and Albert are two of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Along with the rest of the staff they make every visit a good time. 

My favorite time to stop by is lunch time, their orange chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place before with not much thought as it looks \"eh\" from outside.
Someone mentioned I needed to try an sian soup so I looked up the name.
Pho was what I decided she mentioned and reviews for simis was there. Not far from the house so I went.
According the reviews I got soup and orange chicken but I wanted to try something new.
Also got green curry, yellow curry, and pork fried rice.
YELLOW curry was awesome!
Sweet, spicy...hit the spot.
Orange chicken was good. Not like processed, definitely made fresh.
Pork fried was was good. Not over the top special but will be great as a reheated leftover lunch.

I'm a service snob so was judgy judge lady from the start.
I went in and took a seat close to door just in case.
Greeted quickly by a busy server. When she had an extra second to tend to me only she gave me her full attention. She helped me make some decisions and I was satisfied.

I had a great view of kitchen and restaurant. Everyone was working efficiently, place was clean. Great so far.

My food was brought to me, wrapped very well ( I was pretty impressed at how well and sturdy,)

Once server Diane heard my name she used it to check on me often, did I want water? More water? Etc.

As others walked in she would refer to them by name...
Impressive

I will be going back soon. This time I will eat there to get full effet of Pho soup...and I will definitely get the yellow curry again...it was the best."}
{"text":"Great place great people great atmosphere overall a very awesome place must try if you like Chinese food in the east valley"}
{"text":"The best service I've received at a restaurant in a long time. Food is amazing!! We had the orange chicken! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I am a huge sucker for some good Chinese food, especially since I have lived in China before. I wish I could remember the exact name of the dish that I ordered. It was beef with flat noodles and tasted JUST like something I always had in China! I loved it and it brought back good memories. My boyfriend got the orange chicken and loved it, but the portion just wasn't enough for him, so he'll probably get something else next time. I definitely want to go back to try the pho. 
The staff was extremely friendly! Every single one of them was so nice to us! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing redesign. Very nice interior. Excellent attentive service. Good variety of delicious Asian dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  $5 lunch! Can't beat that! The owners are there and very friendly. I love this place. Highly recommend if you are looking for good,  affordable Chinese food in Gilbert or Mesa area."}
{"text":"First time here was last Tuesday. Service and food was amazing!! There were nine of us and we all had a terrific experience. Don't be fooled by the exterior, this place is a gem. Our table had the sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, Kung pao beef, potstickers, and crab wontons and everything was phenomenal!!! We will be back, often!!"}
{"text":"You gotta try the Thai Tea! 

My friends and I have going to Simi's Cafe for quite some time now, and I've gotta say, it never disappoints! Whether you are into Orange Chicken or Pho, Crab Puffs or Pot Stickers (if you are a bit picky, just ask Diane for suggestions), this place has everything you need. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming and I can't think of much else to say other than to try out that Thai Tea; it is delicious~!

Great food, great staff, and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Place is super clean , everyone is super friendly I love the pho there. The lunch specials are good my husband thinks portions are a little small but good is great!"}
{"text":"The food is beyond great!!  We drive from South Gilbert to eat here. The customer service is phenomenal. Highly recommended, you won't regret!! 
Trying the Orange Chicken, it'll be your new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm back. We were last here two years ago.  Being in the area, and noting that the reviews here continue to be very good, we came in again.  I decided to order something different this time (if you read my last review you'll note I thought everything was \"OK\", but not rave-worthy). This time we (three of us) ordered yellow curry chicken, beef pho, vegetable fried rice, and chicken vegetable (stir fry).  Plus we got the egg rolls from the Yelp check-in coupon.

Immediately after ordering some egg drop soup was brought to us.  Probably part of the meal (though I didn't notice it mentioned on the menu).  It was simple but good.  Better than most egg drop soup you usually get.  It has a bit more robust flavor, and bits of stuff in it (instead of just a thin broth). 

The pho was really good (remember to add the hoisin and chili sauces provided...it's better that way). 

The yellow curry needs more chicken and potatoes, but the flavor was good. But it really did need more substance (meat and potatoes). Don't believe them about \"spicy\". It had just enough spice to feel a little bit, but it really wasn't spicy. 

The fried rice also had really good flavor.

So it looks like this time the dishes were more flavorful, and just better. The one real criticism would be that the yellow chicken curry was more curry soup and less chicken.  Flavor was really good, but this dish I would rate barely-three stars because of its thinness.  The other dishes were all 4 stars or higher.  And our server was very friendly with just the right attentiveness to be sure everything was OK.  All that considered I think they exceeded the threshold for FOUR stars today."}
{"text":"This place not only has a great menu, great pho but it also has the best customer service I've ever experienced. They are extremely nice and want you to be satisfied. I absolutely love this place and will continue going back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Modern decor. Clean restaurant.  Staff is attentive and friendly.  Food tastes very fresh and light. Always keeping an eye on the water which is nice. Food arrived quickly and to temperature.  Offered egg drop soup even though I was not ordering off the lunch menu. Pork rolls were very good, was advised by staff to wrap in lettuce provided before dipping, made the difference!"}
{"text":"I thought I had posted a review?!?!  If not -- posting one now.  I've eaten here at least twice a month for lunch over the past four years and never once have I had a bad meal or service.  I remember when they first opened and how they ended up from New York to Gilbert, AZ and I'm glad they still are passionate about what they serve and the chef in the kitchen is still making it happen on a consistent basis.  I will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy food 
Pho is delicious
Diane is very hospitable and definitely knows her guests and her regulars ."}
{"text":"Simi's cafe is one of those restaurants that you get pleasantly surprised right when you open the door. On the outside, it's nothing special, dark windows that make you wonder what the hell you are getting yourself into and then you enter, you find a cozy, nicely decorated, and spacious cafe with a sophisticated ambience. Not to mention, how clean it is! You rarely find a pho restaurant that doesn't smell somewhat bad but this place didn't smell at all. 

My husband and I went for lunch on a Saturday and despite how busy they were, the service was EXCELLENT and the pho was delicious. Their noodles were properly cooked and not undercooked like many of the places I've been to in AZ and their broth was rich and clean. Also, because I am a fan of small details that restaurants invest in, I have to mention this: they use light steel bowls as opposed to the white plastic bowls the other places use, which keeps the broth warm longer and is just better! 

Looks like we found our go-to place that's closer to us. We didn't get her name but the waitress was so well spoken and courteous, I felt like we were at a 5-star restaurant. With that being said, most appropriately, I am giving Simi's Cafe 5 stars."}
{"text":"Services is excellent & very friendly. Had the Summer rolls & Pho soup & will definitely be coming back Pho-sure;) very tasty!"}
{"text":"Waitress wasn't willing to make changes.  \"Not GF\".  When you visit an Asian food restaurant there are ways, easy ways to create \"Gluten Free\" dishes.  I ordered Pho and it was good.  Didn't care for the unwillingness."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Asian cuisine. The food is great. I don't think I've ever ordered anything I didn't like, and I usually try something new every time. Everything has always been amazing. Orange chicken hands down is my favorite. But all the other traditional plates are great too (kung pao, pepper beef, teriyaki, curry, etc). The servers are also very nice and really take care of you."}
{"text":"Very nice place and the people are nice too. Hot and sour soup was good. And the calamari was"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Chinese food in Maricopa County. My wife and I have been to many but this place takes the cake. We ate the wontons, orange peel chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and soup. All were very good. We recommend this spot to others. Newly renovated restaurant as well."}
{"text":"4 Star Service 3.5 Stars For Flavor, 4 Stars For Value

The service here was very polite and nice all around.

I ordered the Beef Noodle Pho Soup and it wasn't terrible at all, but it was mostly lacking flavor of almost any kind. I feel the broth needs a bit more flavor or it was like water soup. I came just for the Pho after reading a yelp review that praised it...

The veggie egg rolls were tasty little treats!

They have super good $5.95 lunch specials which is something to try next time for me. 

All in all I would rate 3.5 stars based on this experience. I want to rate higher because of how nice they were here, but the flavor wasn't there."}
{"text":"The BEST Pho of my life! I don't do noodles and they accommodated me with additional vegetables!. The employees are genuinely super friendly and make the experience so relaxing. My husband had shrimp fried noodles and the shrimp were exquisitely done to perfection and bursting with flavor. I'm guessing this must be family owned because everyone took pride in their service, food quality, and clearly were having FUN!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner last night, haven't been in for a few months and Diane remembered my name and where I was sitting the last time we came in. Got to meet her husband Albert as well, they are the owners, super impressed by these people and their outlook on their business, their community and their product. Great people and great food, couldn't recommend them highly enough!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab my hubby something for lunch. I was greeted as soon as I stepped through the door, friendly face. The hostess was pleasant. Sat at the bar to order my to go meal and was offered water, that was a plus. Then as I'm waiting the hostess brings me a bowl of soup and says \"relax have a seat and enjoy some soup\". I didn't expect that at all. Don't know what my husbands food taste like but I will definitely be back with service like that."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would! This place was amazing I went with my mom and we absolutely loved Diane! She is so pleasant. Our waitress was very kind as well, but I didn't catch her name. We ordered the crab puffs which were really good, the dough was light and crispy which I loved. We then ordered orange chicken & the house pan fried noodles. Seriously, both were so delicious. I liked the pan fried noodles more though. But definitely would recommend both. The food was beyond delicious, and Diane & our waitress were very attentive. I will come back no matter what just for the service. The best service I've ever received at a restaurant before."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp I went there last night with my wife. It was as good as all the reviews said. We both had Pho and totally enjoyed it. She had beef and I had spicy beef - was it good!  The servings were very large and  I couldn't finish mine (and I am a big guy). We went  knowing in advance we wanted soup but as I looked around at the other diners I almost changed my mind. Every meal out there looked delicious!  Next time we are going to share a soup and get another entree."}
{"text":"Just tried the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special. You really can't beat the deal for what you get. It comes with rice, spring roll, rangoon (very yummy) and egg drop soup, all for six bucks, including tax. 
 I ordered it to go and they brought me the soup to eat while I waited for my food; that makes for good service. The ingredients were fresh, though they should have cooked the veggies a little longer.  The Kung Pao chicken wasn't anything special. I would have liked it to be spicy, but it was still good.  I will go back because I want to try their Pho."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great pho.  She even helped me make a nummy mix to dip the beef in as I was ignorant to the world of pho.  Also, I love that they have three hot tea choices: jasmine, oolong, and green!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading lot of reviews about the restaurant. 

Location is good if you're in Gilbert. They have a large parking lot outside. Easy parking. Inside is better than when it looks like outside. Pretty clean environment. The waiter is really friendly and attentive. Service was fast. The price was average around $8 to $10.


I tried the Pho tai
The broth was okay. Didn't taste like a medicine bag mixture. However, the broth could be better. Definitely a lot of salt in the broth. 
Average size amount of noodles in the bowl. Not a lot of the beef slices. 

Will need to compare with other pho places. 
To get a good feel for the pho game in AZ. 

Nothing spectacular compared to California. But it's California."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. Clean tasty and friendly. Tired of franchises? Check Simi's Cafe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!! Been here several times, we call it the tattoo day. We get a tattoo and then come here, best day out of the year. Sadly, we moved to Chandler a year ago but we make the 20mi drive just to come here. Even if its not tattoo day. We tried a few other Chinese restaurants and all of them were blah, Simis is different. Food taste fresh and everything taste amazing. Try the fried calamari and chili's!!! Best calamari ever. The service is always great and clean."}
{"text":"My friend sent me a snap chat of this amazing looking food and I only had a vague idea of what it was so I showed up here and showed them the picture and they got me situated with Beef Chow Fun and it was so good! There's a place down the road that also has this and they deliver so I was hoping maybe it would be as good but it's not so I will definitely be back and give some other items a try as well. :)"}
{"text":"The Curry God works here. I had the green chicken curry with vegetables and I've never tasted such fresh spices and well made curry. 

The Thai tea is also fantastic. Drank it at 6pm and was up until 2am high on life. 

The service is exceptional. You're just like family there! 

Go, go, go... you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is good. The prices are amazing. Its my go to place in Gilbert for Pho. The thing that really keeps me coming back is the service. The waitresses there are extremely friendly. Always an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Wanted some wonton soup, so we found this place while out shopping.  Husband had the orange chicken.  Both items were delicious.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but man I cannot recommend this place.

Service and the staff were friendly and on top of things.  Food however was horrid.  It felt like the seasoning tasted like it was out of a package and just add water and ingredients!  I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken, while my friends ordered the Pan Fried Noodles with Seafood and Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai my friend had was colorless and bland; it tasted like they used old oil to fry it too.  My Thai Basil Chicken was what I consider sustenance....I've had better camp food from a bag from Walmart.  Again bland, colorless, and just straight up not good...!  My other friends Pan Friend noodles were decent, crispy noodles atop with vegetables and a seafood medley.  Again the lack of sauce and seasoning that should be doused on this dish should soften the noodles.

I always try to think of a ways that would help instead of just complaining.  Hire a new chef is one.  Basic Chinese food is not that hard to make in reality.  The lack of seasoning really plays a big part to the chef; I've been the the food industry long enough and still is to know this truth.  If it's an off night; then it was way off!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food here is delicious but I do have a few critiques. The chicken has flavor on it but the flavor doesn't have time to absorb into the meat and veggies. The taste that is on it is delicious though. I also wish the chicken was crispier in the dishes and that they allowed you select a spice on more dishes. The chicken potstickers and the veggie egg rolls are some of the best in the east valley!"}
{"text":"pretty good place for a quick cheap lunch. good variety of Asian food, not just typical chinese. Servers were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly and just a great environment to enjoy food and company of others. I really liked that it was beautiful inside and also very reasonable pricing. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! we were looking for a new place to stop by and eat dinner and boy am i happy we stopped here. The people are friendly and very attentive and the food is great! i ordered the pho and it has to be one of the best i ever had. This place will defiantly be a place we eat often as a family from now on."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Love this place. Best Chinese food in town by far. Beautiful seating area is well very welcoming."}
{"text":"Awesome service and good food. I ordered Pho with beef and meatballs, next time I will not get the combination and just beef but the soup overall was great I just didn't like the meatballs.  The staff is very nice and personable as is the atmosphere. When on this side of the city I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Everything here has been good. The owner is very friendly and welcoming.

The lunch specials, while super cheap, are a bit small.  I was still hungry after. 

Vietnamese spring rolls ftw!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  Nice atmosphere inside, great service, good prices and the food was excellent.  We're vegetarian and, although it was not on the menu, they made us vegetarian summer rolls, and a nice green curry dish with tofu.  The server (who I assume is the owner), was very pleasant and more than willing to discuss menu options with us and customize something.  It's worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great speed for a lunch date.  Tried the beef pho and my friend got the orange chicken.  So yummy and with the $5 lunch specials and free egg rolls for a yelp checkin, awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place, the service is the best and Vietnamese food is spot on. I stopped in one night late to try there pho a there Vietnamese iced coffee, It was perfect the very nice lady gave us the best service and was very friendly. Needles to say we are now regulars and have gone back every time it's the same best service with awesome food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The service is great. The staff of the family owned restaurant knows everyone by name. They have a lot of different choices and the the food is a good mix of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai influence. They don't over Americanize their dishes. My personal favorites are the Won Ton Noodle Soup, the black pepper chicken, and the green curry."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a Chinese restaurant that I like for quite some time now. Yelp recommended this restaurant as a great restaurant for a great price. They were not kidding. We walked in 15 min before they closed and we received nothing but sweet welcome responses from all the staff. We were told to not worry about leaving but just enjoy eating. I ordered the King Pau chicken, which was pretty good. My son asked the sweet waitress what she liked and she recommended the orange chicken and my wife was unsure what to get and so she asked my wife what kind of food she liked and then recommended Mongolian Beef. The orange chicken was the best I have ever had. There was enough food for all of us to be filled and to bring some home for my other son. The food was wonderful!!! The service was even better!!! We had barely ordered before the food was on the table. Again, I can not express how wonderful the service was. They were sweet and wonderful and attentive the whole time we were there. I never felt rushed to leave. I felt like they loved having us there and I will be frequenting their establishment a lot more now. Great food, great price and excellent service. Well done Simi's Cafe, well done indeed."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef pho soup and asked for extra noodles. Customer service was really good, greeted by a nice lady. Ordered a takeout and the food was ready immediately. Ate it at home and was really happy with how everything turned out. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup in town. OMG.  You can't go wrong in this place.   Best customer service."}
{"text":"Great orange chicken, soups, and summer rolls. The curry and pad Thai is...not what I'm used to, but not bad as long as you expect something new. However, the service could not be better. Oh, and try the boba!

Update: if the owner isn't working, service is not quite the same level"}
{"text":"So far this is the best Chinese food I have had in Gilbert. The flavor was so savory and delicious. I had beef lo mein, and it was fantastic. Also had crab puffs, and they were great. Will defiantly be back! 

Also...the owners and wait staff were top notch. Came and talk to us and made sure we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING! This is the real Asian food :) absolutely delicious in my opinion.  Great family owned and run restaurant.  The orange chicken is like nothing else around,  sauce is so flavorful and made from real ingredients.  Pho is awesome,  Hong Kong won ton soup is a must try as well."}
{"text":"We originally found this place on Yelp a couple of years ago, and its about time I wrote a review. First of all, it is clean. So many restaurants are subpar where cleanliness is concerned, but not Simi's Cafe. They are also inexpensive. You get a lot of really good food and you don't break your bank account, which is great. My entire family loves the food, and there is truly something for everyone. There is Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, which is a very diverse menu. We love the beef chow mein, the curries, the eggplant is a delicious vegetarian option, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night with a friend. I got the orange chicken with white rice. Very good. I got it extra spicy, but it still was not very spicy. They brought over chili oil to help out and that did the trick. I tried the iced green tea. It was good, but a little too sweet for me. The crab puffs were very nice. Also, on your first check in, you get free spring rolls. 

Staff was very friendly and the customer service was awesome. Drinks always full and service was very fast. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Place is really good. The chicken pho soup is solid. Very nice people. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Simi Cafe and I will definitely be back. The Pho was excellent and the service was great. All of the staff were very friendly and went out of the way to pay attention to my 2 year old grandson. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great local business! The owners/workers are very friendly and personable.  You can tell they take pride in their business.  I had the traditional pho and my friend ordered vegetarian pho..we were both pleased with our meals.  Looks like a found my local pho place in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Since our first visit in January (2015), we have been coming here regularly to get our Pho and Orange Chicken fix. It has gotten to the point where we sat down in a different Vietnamese restaurant and only ordered an appetizer because we realized we would be unsatisfied with the food and service when compared to Simi's Café. Not only is the food phenomenal here, the service is even better. I can't say enough about how well Diane treats her customers. She either knows every single person who walks through the door or certainly treats them like she does. She always has a happy and positive attitude and seems delighted to serve us. She even takes care of us when we're sick! (Insisted on giving me a cup of tea when I was too sick to come in to eat)

Bottom line: If you haven't been to Simi's Café, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken fried rice!  The staff is wonderful!  Best Pho in the area, tons of flavor! HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. So excited that they are opening a Poke bowl place adjoining it. The orange chicken is so good and I usually don't like orange chicken. Staff is so helpful and service great"}
{"text":"Why four stars? It's a good restaurant with great customer service but the food, although tasty, is nothing special. You can find food like theirs in most Chinese restaurants. 
If you live in the area, by all means go to this restaurant and enjoy it. If not, you can probably find similar food in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"This review is for \"to go\" only. 
I had 6 dishes total for to go, 
two of them pass the test of these great review.

Here are two dishes i would give it 5 stars.
1. Tom Yum Soup, it still tasted great when it gets home.
2. Seafood Chow Fun , the flavor; the seafood and noodle amount has good balance. I would order this dish again.

The 4 dishes gets two stars .
1.Thai Basil Chicken. 
It is nothing like other Thai restaurant, which has tons of basil and chicken. We had to dig through celery and onions to find basil and chicken. 
2. House Pan Fried noodles. 
It was dry and no flavor;  very conservative on amount of meat and seafood.
3. Black Pepper Chicken. 
Lots of vegetable ; very few pieces of chicken.
4. Mongolian Beef.  Flavor is very good, beef amount also good.
 but texture of beef is like many other Chinese restaurant, too much baking soda.

I average two dishes of 5 stars and 4 dishes of two stars.
3 stars is more realistic for \"to go dishes\".

However, two children of mine had a 5 star experience eating in.
They both extremely impressed with the good service.
Dishes got 5 stars from them: 
Orange chicken ; Calamari and Chilies and Poke Bowl."}
{"text":"Orange chicken  & Thai Basil Chicken were amount the best I've ever had. Very tender, almost like fish, and the orange chicken was not over breaded like most places serve. Service was quick and very friendly. A definite regular spot from now on."}

Service is always excellent as well! Just ordered carry out from here last night and somehow there was some confusion on the order(first time this ever happened and I've ordered here a lot) but they corrected it no problem and are always so friendly! !"}
{"text":"My husband eats the Pho at Simi's sometimes 3 times a week! Their prices are ridiculously low for how good their food is and the staff is so nice. They always remember your name and what you like. Greet you with a smile. From the outside it doesn't look like much but inside it is decorated nice and very clean. Great Place!"}
{"text":"This place truly lives by the saying \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" From the outside it looks a little sketch but once you open the doors you find a clean modern cafe that was surprisingly busy on a Friday afternoon. 

Their service is top notch. The waitresses were attentive and kind. We had some special vegetarian requests that were handled with ease and without complaint. Looks like they can make anything vegetarian if you just ask! I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday.  Love the staff, very friendly and attentive .  Had the beef pho and hubby had the kung pap, loved both."}
{"text":"Food was on point. Our waitress was too nice. She explained the menu and was top notch. Looking to become a regular here."}
{"text":"The service takes the cake. Food has been fresh and delicious both times I've eaten here; I have had the pad thai and orange chicken. The Thai tea is sweet and rich - very tasty. I checked-in on Yelp and received a free order of spring rolls. And the owner gave me little cup of soup to enjoy while I waited for my lunch (lunch special is $3.99 btw). It's these little details that make this restaurant worthy of every star!!"}
{"text":"This is our #1 choice for Asian take out. Love the summer rolls, beef pho, house fried rice, shrimp pad Thai, Mongolian beef.  Our daughter loves the egg drop soup. Good for younger and older palates. We eat here sometimes but it gets so busy we'd rather take it home. Staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"For those of you lucky enough to read this,  I would like to tell you that Simi's Cafe located at 2401 E Baseline Rd #118, Gilbert, AZ 85234 is one of the greatest restaurants in Arizona.  The owners are also amazing people and make you feel like family.  If you are lucky enough to catch one of the owners,  Albert,  in the kitchen,  you may be lucky enough to have off the menu items prepared in a master chef style.  These guys are a must watch establishment that is about to expand to cover all culinary desires.  When Chef Albert is at the helm,  he will bring tears to your eyes with his masterful creations and interpretations of his home land of Hong Kong China. Like any good Americans, he is currently adopting a menu that will stun the area. I do not want to give anything away but I am excited that I can continue to visit him several times a week.  I went there today to get a couple of my favorites and was treated with a couple of creations.  Photos of the Pho'rito,  amazing deconstruction of his unbelievable Pho soup made into a burrito. Sorry about the other photo,  I ate most of it to fast,  his own creation of Habanero Chicken Wings with cilantro... Thank you Chef Albert,  you are an incredible addition to our Gilbert community"}

They greet you with happy smiles and literally have the BEST Chinese food I have ever had. Orange chicken and chicken chow mein is to die for! Also get the cream cheese crab puffs. SO Delish. I am so sad we moved farther away from this restaurant. We still make the drive now though because it is so worth it. Their lunch specials are the best too! :)"}
{"text":"Simi's Cafe has superior customer service. You are always greeted with a smile and them being courteous. I have been here three times in a year and the experience is always awesome and consistent. I have only ordered the pho tai and it is scrumptious - be careful because the broth is hot! I highly recommend this place based on the service alone. Let's be honest, in today's society, service is a rarity and commodity."}
{"text":"We love simis - the food is so fresh - this is one of our regular stops - Staff is very nice - awesome place"}
{"text":"Diane is very personable and has a warmth about her that makes you feel at ease. The food is always amazing and they're able to adjust spiciness and able to make most things vegetarian. They're very quick with orders and food is presented in a beautiful manner."}
{"text":"Another amazing night this place never disappoints. The owners are the most friendly people. The place was very busy but she still took the time to great every customer. First time trying the sea food soup it was amazing, the broth was on point not to salty."}
{"text":"The waitress was very sweet and my food (black pepper chicken) was very good. My husband did not care for his (red curry chicken) very much."}
{"text":"I love this place! The first time I had ever heard about it was on a Yahoo article about the best restaurants per state, and this place represented Arizona. I guess everyone else saw this article and decided that they would go that Saturday, and there was a line out the door with two hour waits. I was shocked and decided to re-visit another time; I never regret that decision.

One thing I will say is that it may be easy to go past this gem of a restaurant because it's tucked in a plaza of businesses including a dance studio, an insurance place, hydroponics, and a tattoo parlor, but don't be discouraged! This place is worth it!

First of all, Diane and her staff are amazing! Diane is the owner and the life of the restaurant besides one of the waitresses, Dui. She is super sweet, and she always remembers you, what you order or what you talked about last time you saw her - even if it has been a couple months. Her husband occasionally helps with the restaurant, and he is equally a cool guy. A lot of the charm in this place is their service.

My husband and I have tried a lot of dishes on the menu over the year-maybe two years we started coming here. This is our go-to place for good Asian cuisine but mainly Chinese food. It is clean and the pricing is fair for the portions you get. The best deal is the $5 lunch plates where you get a good sized plate for the amount.

For appetizers, I would highly recommend the crab puffs. Those puffs are dangerously delicious because you can actually taste the green onions and the crab. Most of the time in other Chinese restaurants, you can only taste cream cheese. This has a good balance of all the ingredients. I also suggest the Vietnamese Pork Spring Rolls (cha gio) because although you get two, they are made with a perfect balance to the accompanying lettuce, vegetables and fish sauce dip. Another good one to have are the dumplings. 

For days when I crave soup (and not have to book it to the best pho place in town, which is all the way in Scottsdale), or I'm just feeling horrible, cold, or sick, I get the chicken pho. The restaurant provides a good broth, fresh ingredients to add to your soup, and a good amount of chicken and noodles to your soup. It definitely fills you up and makes you feel good about life again.

The crown jewel of the restaurant dishes is the orange chicken. The reason why this dish stands out among the crowd is that it doesn't take the doughy, puffy breading approach that most Chinese restaurants do. Instead they focus on being the chicken dish you needed to prove all those others wrong - more chicken substance matters. They lightly coat the chicken in either cornstarch or flour so that there is a crispy outer layer to your chicken, then they coat it in this orange sauce, which is not overly sweet, has a unique but slightly orange zest flavor, and doesn't taste almost exactly like sweet and sour (another sin of other Chinese food places).

This doesn't mean stop at orange chicken. No! You must try all the dishes! Like the black pepper chicken... The best part about this dish is that the green beans soak up a bit of the sauce's flavor but doesn't fully lose its crisp taste, so it almost comes in as a major player while the chicken is just a perfect partner in crime teamed with the occasional bite of the freshly cracked pepper.

The fried rice is light, fluffy, and flavorful; What more could you ask for?! The chow mein maintains a great flavor where you would think that it's just a side dish, but then no, it delights your palate with a beautiful symphony of flavors and textures ranging from the crisp onions to the soft noodles. 

My brother came once, and he said the curry was amazing! We also loved the General Tso's chicken. Another thing about the staff is that they are quick to give suggestions on what to add (like Spicy sriracha) to best enjoy the dish the way you like it.

I love Simi's Cafe, and I would be sad if they ever left us. Great people, great product, and great atmosphere! I am a repeat customer because the one time I took a chance to come back, they wowed me. And each time I have come back, they never stopped trying!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken around. Can't beat the atmosphere, quality, or price! I just did a large catering order tonight and impressed everyone!"}
{"text":"Decor - it doesn't look like much from the outside, but you will be transported when you walk in.  Very clean and modern. Pictures will tell you all you need to know. 

Service -  I came in at 4pm, so this isn't the best judge of service. I was seated immediately, and my server was quite lovely, finding the line between conversational and professional, anticipating my needs and leaving me alone to enjoy my food. 

However, I appreciated that they boxed my food themselves, and better yet they even asked me if I wanted more rice to go, and if I wanted it with the meal or boxed separately. 

Food - Ordered spring rolls, Vietnamese iced coffee, and cashew chicken. Spring rolls were fresh and tasty, but nothing overtly special. The iced coffee was a bit bland, but the server came back and asked me if it was sweet enough. She took it to the back and got more condensed milk, so that was a big help. The coffee is pretty mixed before it gets to the table, so there was no satisfaction of slugging down a little condensed milk beforehand. 

Drink menu is on the table, not in the menu, so be aware. 

Cashew chicken was very tasty. Vegetables were cooked to the right crispness, and chicken was lean with no fat to be seen! You can tell this dish was made fresh and not just reheated. 

Price - 20$ for drink, appetizer, and entrée (plus 25% tip) is not too bad. 


Overall - Great little place if you want some good Asian food fast and cheap. Not worth driving out of your way to this place however, but if you are close by you owe it to yourself to at least try it."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food. The customer service is top notch! I stopped by after work to pick up my dinner to go. As i sat to wait i ordered a tai tea, my tea arrived in less than a minute. 
As i looked at my menu, the owner (i wish i had asked for her name) sat next to me to answer all of my questions. She was great, friendly and made me feel so at ease. 
I will definitely will be coming back. 
My food was delicious and the price is not bad. 
Next time i will get names and will take pictures."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pho and this place is awesome! The owners are extremely kind and...... Well you just have to go for yourself!"}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese food for dinner.  Found this place on yelp. It was a mixture of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food all under one roof. Checked in received free egg rolls. Ordered BBQ pork slices for appetizer is was delicious! Wasn't a fan of the wasabi mustard they had but the other dipping sauce was good. Server was nice, held a good conversation with us. Ordered three entree seafood pan fried noddles, Mongolia beef and Thai basil chicken. Each dish was full of flavors. Will be coming back soon to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I give a 4 for service. Very nice people working there. Attentive to customers. Offered me a beverage and soup on the house while I waited. The food was definitely a 3. I ordered spicy but it wasn't. I ordered Thai food but it wasn't. They offer Thai but it's certainly not their specialty. Add some oyster sauce and Thai chilis...I was able to revive it at home. They had several regulars come in while I sat there. They could use a better location but the inside was nice."}
{"text":"My review is in the \"tip\" section. All good, 5 stars...but I just notice my \"spring rolls\" were fried...?!?!!"}
{"text":"Words cannot express the greatness and positive energy this cafe holds! From the time you enter to the time you leave, the staff's customer service is 5 star! We were seated promptly and although our pallets differ in spice, our lovely waitress explained the menu to appease both of us. She further explained the spiciness can be toned down to suit my taste and turned up a notch for my better half.

He chose the chicken pad Thai, I went with the orange chicken and we shared the combo pho. Our food was packed with flavor and fresh ingredients. 

We're looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Very very delicious. I had the orange chicken and veggie chow mein and my husband had the cashew chicken. The staff was fantastic and very attentive, and also so patient with my 1 year old. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Near my work so I have been several times. Great value. Best orange chicken I have ever had. Their Pho is the best and always makes me feel good!"}
{"text":"Finally.....a go to asian cafe with killer soups!
Our first time....very nicely decorated inside for a small place in a strip mall. The big red wall is pretty cool!
I had the beef pho soup and summer rolls.
Both were very good and it was nice to taste fresh herbs like mint and basil and ginger in my dinner. Next time, i'm going to order ithe pho soup with more green onion with the heat kicked up a few notches!

We also had the orange chicken and fried rice.
The best fried rice i've had in Az !   It had big chunks of pork with egg in it.
Fried rice is always 6-8 bucks an order but this is the first time it was worth the 6.95.
There were enough leftovers for a second meal. The pho soup is a meal itself.
They also seem to have a very popular coffee drink there. I'll have to try it one day.

The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago and was very impressed. The meal was delicious and the owner was the nicest woman. She took the time to converse with every customer and got to know them. It was really an incredible experience and completely unexpected. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My sister and I are visiting our grandparents from out of town. We went here last night to get takeout for the whole family and it was fast and cheap. Not only was the food very good but the service was IMPECCABLE. The lady was so sweet and even though we were just getting takeout, and the restaurant was relatively busy, she talked to us for a while and genuinely listened. It was a pleasure eating their food and going to the restaurant."}
{"text":"It all started with a search for pho in the east valley...which led me to Simi's Cafe and the fantastic reviews it has earned.

I must say, the stars are a great indicator of how fantastic this place is! A friend of mine and I went in for dinner on Wednesday and WOW. The place is so cozy and trendy inside. I love the red velvet touches! The sweet lady who waited on us was so helpful in answering questions about the menu and checked on us regularly and made us feel right at home.

Now...to the food...so so good. I had vegetable fried rice with crispy tofu which was  so packed full of veggies, snap peas, carrots, mushrooms and broccoli to name a few. The flavor was incredible and our server recommended adding some hot sauce to it in the future, which I WILL be doing.

My friend had the green curry chicken, which I stole a few bites of...and wow, the perfect combination of spicy and sweet with just a hint of lemongrass.

Very great experience and we will back back!"}
{"text":"Service is alway fantastic. Owner/server really remembers everyone great neighbor hood joint.  Love their beef pho , pho tai now they use really tender and juicy beef, deify higher quality than most regular pho joint ( this place does not specialize in pho)  never really tried their Chinese/Thai stuff but crab puff was great.     I'm just glad I can get my hands on pho in Gilbert area :).  But like I said , they do not specialize in pho or Vietnamese so don't expect full viet menu but their beef pho is great."}
{"text":"Simi's Cafe for lunch is now one of my \"Go To\" spots. I have gone three times and each time was Awesome! Greeted promptly by staff and seated right away. The waitress uses a tablet to take your order which I thought was pretty cool. The lunch specials are $4.99 and you get a full plate.

I highly recommend the orange chicken as they lightly bread, fried and then lightly covered with orange sauce. It's amazing with rice, crab puff, egg drop soup and spring roll. 

The food comes out hot and fresh with promptness. Everything is cooked to order. Waitresses are always friendly. Seating is comfortable and the smoothie bar with TV's are a nice flare to the ambience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great customer service. Low price. Orange chicken and pho were delicious! Will defiantly visit again when in town! The owners are super friendly and helpful with the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, low prices, large portions and great customer service. The orange tofu was wonderful! I have been craving it ever since. Can't wait to get it again!"}
{"text":"great homemade pho and even better customer service. our server was very attentive and made sure that our experience was enjoyable .will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. We moved from Hawaii and really miss Vietnamese cuisine. Summer rolls were just like those we got back in Hawaii. The pho and the bun were just as good or better than what we are used to. Will make this a monthly lunch go to place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The owner is extremely nice. The orange chicken is fantastic. I am a regular and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm a Pho addict. There. I said it. The first step is to admit you have a \"problem\"   : ) The only problem I have with Pho is trying to find a good one!  Well that problem is SOLVED!! Simi's Cafe has the best Pho I've had anywhere in the greater Phoenix area. Oh, they may not put the most beef in it, or give you the most basil (although I'm sure Ms. Diane would give you more if you asked), but the broth is out of this world with depth of flavor and richness! Honestly, isn't the flavor of the broth by far and away the most important thing when it comes to Pho? And the asian beef balls are the most flavorful I've had anywhere! I was greeted like I was a member of the family, with a smile and a welcoming attitude and the food came out super fast! I will be back, and often! Thank you Simi's!"}
{"text":"Excellent.

Sweet and Sour chicken was fantastic.

Pad Thai very good.

Roast pork fried rice was outstanding.

Very, very friendly staff and great service.

Don't let the outside fool you!

It is worth a try."}
{"text":"Our 3rd visit and the food was great once again!  We had Hot and Sour Soup snd Seafood Pad Thai.  Service really nice snd friendly and the place is extremely clean."}
{"text":"Nice blend of Asian Cuisines, 5 star service, in a comfortable setting. This was our first time at this restaurant and it was a pleasant evening. The food arrived at the table quickly, almost to fast to allow us to savor the Tom Yum Soup which arrived before the rest of the dinner. We asked that the soup be on the mild side and it was good we did. It was hot, but not to hot, so it is just a guess that if you order it hot you may be sweating before you finish. Tom Yum Soup is a favorite of mine here it was full of shrimp, squid, fish, and all. It was especially good when I hit the scallop in my bowl, it had so much flavor, I wondered if it had been grilled before entering the soup. 

The appetizers of Crab Puffs, and Pot Stickers came with the main courses of Beef Fried Rice & Chicken Chow Mein. The Pot Stickers were out standing, plump and yummy with a very nice sauce. The course sizes were pretty normal maybe on the smallish size for typical Chinese servings, the three of us had our fill and there were some boxes of left overs... 

If you are looking for a good meal at very reasonable prices this place will fill the bill. The selection of Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese allows you to sample things you might not be familiar with in a meal that includes things you know you like. Next trip it will be the Beef Pho Soup that the waitress says is there specialty.  Personally I would have wanted the food to come at a more relaxed pace, sometimes it takes a few trips to a good restaurant to figure it all out. 

Remember to show your check in, we were talking to the waitress towards the end of our meal as to how we found them, we yelped them!.... And the check in button presented us with a online coupon so, some complementary spring rolls that were added to the take home boxes! They were very nice about it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their food.  Their service is supreme!  The owners are always to courteous and kind.  I have not tried anything there that I don't like.  I highly recommend their HONG KONG STYLE WONTON NOODLES SOUP.  My husband loves their Thai Basil Chicken, but we have also tried their Curry Chicken (they have three varieties).  It is hard to pick just one dish.  The place is also comfortable and not as noisy as other restaurants.  This is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT! Service was AMAZING! Highly recommend coming here. Beautiful and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs- went here on Tuesday 3/6/18 around 2pm. Ordered the chicken chow mein and chicken fried rice. Been sick ever since until NOW with food poisoning! Me and my18 month old are the only ones who ate here and have been so sick! Disgusting. Second time here and it will
Definitely be my last. Maybe a call to the health inspector is needed for them to clean the back
Of the house!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service so happy I found this place!!! First time trying pho and I'm now addicted.  Really yummy orange chicken too.  It was a to go order and they gave us soup and ice water with lime while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"Always remembers me by name and knows my order and does whatever she can to make it a great experience every time. Even when they are super busy she always makes us feel like we are her most loyal customers and that we are getting special treatment. Love this place for the Orange chicken lunch special. Tons of food and very well priced. How do they make it so good and sell it so cheap? It's not rubbery mystery meat it is real chicken"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is always fresh and quickly served. The wait staff is excellent and the restaurant is always well maintained. Their lunch specials can't be beat. This is the place to come to."}
{"text":"Walked in right before they opened great service  friendly people the pho was great only bad thing the tea tasted lil off"}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting Simi's. We just love it! The service couldn't be quicker or friendlier. We were seated right away and a man immediately brought my two children cups of water with lids (a great distraction for them right from the start). The waitresses get down to my kids' levels and talk with them. It's so sweet. We got the same meals as last time because we were so impressed. I had the chicken Pho and my husband had the green curry. The kids split the orange chicken (my husband says it's the best orange chicken he has ever had). I just can't say enough about how great the service and food are!"}
{"text":"Update: Had again tonight. My party ordered the vietnamese beef over rice, the green curry, and the pho. The food was very good, Vietnamese beef over rice was cooked perfectly, and my curry was very flavorful, but also a bit spicy so be warned. They ran out of beef for the pho, unfortunatley, so my dad  got the beef chow fun. It took a while to come out and we were already there for a long time, however, the food was delicious (And on the house) so no worries there! ONce again, a lovely experience at Simis and we will be back. Also, to add again, the service here is fantastic!!! Top notch! We'd come back just because the waitress is so good at what she does!!"}
{"text":"I gave a luncheon for 18 clients and ordered the Orange Chicken, Pepper Chicken, Chicken-Fried Rice and Vegetable Shrimp (also crab cakes and pot stickers for appetizers).  I usually do Pei Wei but decided to use this Mom and Pop and got rave reviews from my clients.  No more Pei Wei."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE&AMAZING FOOD!!!

I looked for restaurant on yelp since I was on a trip with my fam from LA and wasnt familiar with the area here. 
So we came in for lunch and first of all this nice lady took us to the table.
We got 3 lunch specials $4.99 each (Kung Pao Chicken, Vegetable Delight, and Orange Chicken)for 3 adults and a 5years old. 
They all came with rice, egg drop soup, veggie egg roll, and crab cream cheese wonton. 

*Orange Chicken -AMAZING. Perfectly crispy and tangy refreshing sauce. 

*Kang Pao Chicken -Little spicy yet so good. 

*Vegetable Delight -Assorted veggies in garlicky sauce. Its not so heavy so it was good:)

Veggie Egg roll and wontons were super crispy and YUUUUM:)

We also got vietnamese iced coffee with milk and it was very good!! They brew it fresh and add the sweet condensed milk in it.  ($2.50)
and a hot Green Tea and Jasmine Tea ($1.25 each)

What really made me happy enough to write a review for this place (I normally dont write reviews haha) is their AMAZING SERVICE.

I usually dont expect a great service from a family owned chinese restaurants but this place was totally different then what I expected.

I think the server who served us was an owner of the place (Simi?) and she was such a lovely person!!

She came to refill our waters and teas even when we didnt even finish them!

And I cant thank her enough when she run out of the store to hand me the stuff I left on the table!! We were about to leave in the car but she literally run out and made sure that I got it.
I mean, what more can you ask!?

I have never seen such a kind, friendly, warm-hearted server/owner in my life!
And I strongly suggests everyone to try this place because its AMAZING! 

Thank you so much Simi, you made my trip to Arizona fantastic and I will for sure come back when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"Pho was excellent along with their famous orange chicken. Love the look of their dining room, very modern and fresh. Finished our meal with an excellent Thai iced tea with boba and Vietnamese iced coffee. The drinks were addicting and I may stop going to Starbucks."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.  I love the people that are there as they are all very friendly but honestly I have been there for lunch multiple times and it takes SOO long! I cannot take a 2 hour lunch.  However, the food is really good and the decor inside is pretty nice.  The outside doesn't give it justice at all as the interior is really nice"}
{"text":"One of the best family owned restaurants in town. The seafood chow fun is remarkable. The pho is incredible. In fact,  I have not ordered anything yet that I didn't like. Every time my family and I eat here,  the owners treat us like their own family."}
{"text":"Had beef pho; it was ok. Very salty and noodles were weird. But it was a nice environment with very nice staff. I would give it another chance."}
{"text":"Worst pho I have ever had!  The waitress was soooo nice though.  She offered me another kind, but it was bland too.  I love pho and I have it all over the valley.  My husband and I came here to try it due to all the reviews, but honestly we hated it.  We ended up leaving and going somewhere else for good pho.  The pho here was tasteless, T)the broth had no flavor or aroma.  It was like hot water with noodles in it and two shrimp and one scallop.  My husband had the beef pho and I had the seafood pho.  His was just as bland.  The waitress then brought me a bowl of egg flower soup to try and it was the same way.  Even the summer rolls were a disapointment.  They didnt even come with peanut sauce but hoisin sauce instead and they tasted bland too.  I cant say enough about how kind the waitress though.  She was very understanding and apologetic."}
{"text":"The Pho was fabulous. Definitively a place I'll be eating more often. Looking forward to trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"I just got the Mongolian beef lunch special and was not all that impressed. The beef had a lot of gristle which made it difficult to eat. In addition there was not much beef to veggie ratio. I may try this place again and order something different."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Love the food! I would recommend the pho spicy beef soup to anyone. I have been going here for a little over a year and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, service was super friendly and fast! Chicken noodle soup(pho) was hot and delicious! Free veggie spring roll with the check in was nice. This restaurant does not serve alcohol tho, not that it's a problem, the food does all the talking! Definitely going to come back to try some of the other dishes they have!"}
{"text":"GO HERE!
That's really all I can say; my husband and I are regulars, and the only negative is that it took us so long to try it. I drive past this shopping area daily, and never thought to stop in this café. I am so happy that we found it, because I was in need of a good Pho place.

My husband is mildly obsessed with their orange chicken. He gets it spicy, and it is so ridiculously good that I have turned my back on my beloved pho a few times to order it because he won't share this dish.

The owner is incredible; she has been so welcoming, even on a night that they were closing, and we didn't realize. She has helped us make decisions on the food, and is so helpful.

I love this place; times a million. Go Here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place; everyone is friendly and polite. They remember my order and the food is great."}
{"text":"Wow... so I pulled up a Yahoo article on best Chinese restaurants and saw Simi's. Better yet, it was about a ten-minute drive away! I had nothing to lose so I tried them out.

Absolutely... delicious... food. First off, they make an excellent Thai tea (I'm a bit of an addict and \"connoisseur\"). That's always a big plus for me. Secondly, their service was quite prompt despite having to wait. It's a small place and the food is good, so if you go for dinner be prepared to wait (it's worth it). Another thing about their service is that it felt natural. You ever go to a restaurant and it feels like they're reading a script (because they are) or you're talking to a butler? You don't get that here. They treat you like they've known you for years and make efforts to remember your name, as others have mentioned.

Okay, on to the food. The Yahoo article mentioned that people go nuts over their Orange Chicken, so that's what I ordered. I was blown away. See, the problem with a lot of Chinese restaurants is that they load their dishes up with breading, salt, and sticky-sweet sauces that can be a bit over-powering and hard on the stomach. Simi's is one of the few places I've had Americanized Chinese food that don't overdo things like this. The chicken was crisp, and the sauce perfectly balanced. Their crab puffs are nothing to sneeze at either.

I've gone back to this place for lunch and got something different, the name of which escapes me, but it was still delicious. Maybe one day I'll try something else, but I, like many others, have fallen under the spell of their Orange Chicken. I'm sure the cooks/chefs have nightmares about Orange Chicken orders.

I highly recommend this place. They have a great assortment of various dishes and, if the dishes I had are any indication, you can't go wrong with any of them... but try the Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"Very very delicious food. First time coming here. Saw the great reviews and they are 100 % right on. Also very friendly staff. This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"You know it is hard to find rel ay at the m tic asisan food with that real family home Tate and experience. This place rocks and the service was like going to my sister's house. OITSTANDING"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I were looking for a place for lunch, and we decided on Simi's based on the reviews we read. We arrived early in anticipation of a busy lunch hour. That proved to be a good idea! When we drove up, though, there was absolutely nothing that made me want to enter. The restaurant is in a strip mall, which appeared to be mostly vacant. There was also some litter in the parking area. We decided to go in, and fortunately the restaurant appeared clean inside. 

The service was very good. Our waitperson was very attentive and friendly. The food arrived quickly, but was only mediocre. The price was right at $5.95 for a lunch special, which included soup and an egg roll, along with the entree. I imagine the price is the main factor for the large lunch crowd and number of excellent reviews. It was OK, but we decided we would not return."}
{"text":"I almost wanted to give them a bad review just so people didn't take over my favorite spot but they are so sweet. The BEST service. And they do orders on an iPad so the kitchen starts working on your order (drinks too) before they ever leave your table. All of this aaaaand the food is fan-fuckin-tastic! I will say that the take out is not as crisp as eating in."}
{"text":"The food is great! The owner is amazing!  She remembers our order  down to the drink.  A must visit!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. I really dig the modern decor!

The pho tai is nothing in comparison to Southern Cali's 626 area but it comes close.  Good flavor. $6.00

Also got one of lunch specials which is orange chicken, brown rice, egg roll, and a fried cream cheese wanton. Mmm I gotta say man, I really liked their chicken. I'm so use to fast food orange chicken where the meat is covered in a bulky batter and then fried and sauced. This place'a orange chicken is crispy without a batter and covered in sauce. $5.50 lunch special.

Restaurant offers Vietnamese food, Thai, and Chinese. I'll come back when I visit to try other things :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome atmosphere. Service is prompt and everyone helps take care of the customers. Family owned and they make you feel like a part of it every time you're there"}
{"text":"I have been to Simi's Cafe quite a few times, and it is delicious every time! The pork fried rice and house fried rice are fantastic. The Pho Ga soup is very good. Definitely do a check-in and get the spring rolls, they are quite good!"}
{"text":"This place was great; didn't look like much from the outside but you get inside and the service was great, and the food really tasty. 

We ordered the hot and sour soup. It was a little gelatinous for my taste, but it was extra hot, temperature wise, and that made it much better. I think I will try the pho next time though.

We also had the bbq pork chow mein, broccoli and beef, and spring rolls.

I wouldn't recommend the fried spring rolls...very greasy. I saw another table w fresh rolls and those looked better."}
{"text":"Very nice place. We don't normally do Chineese food, but this was all really good and the service was so attentive and kind.
This isn't super close to our house, but it was totally worth the drive and I think we will be back when we are on this side of town"}
{"text":"*NOTE* - The map on yelp is incorrect.  This place is located on Baseline between Gilbert and Lindsay.  Google maps shows it correctly.

I'm not an Asian food expert, I've mostly tried just the chains (PF Changs, etc).  But wow... This place blows any other Asian place I've tried out of the water!!! Seriously... We had the pork and veggie spring rolls, and I had no idea spring rolls could be this good.  I was tempted to keep ordering them.  Then I had the orange chicken.  Incredible.  If I ever want Asian food, this is where I will want to go.  The service was really friendly.  It's a family owned place and they make you feel part of the family."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken ever!!! I'll be back from Miami to have another plate better believe :)"}
{"text":"Service and food were both EXCELLENT!
I swear the food arrived on our table before we even finished ordering it! I have no idea how they did it, dark magic I assume, but these women are awesome!"}
{"text":"After visiting the Tat shop across the parking lot we decided to give this place a try. My wife had been told it has good food. Someone was right.
     We started with the Calamari. Not prepared as you would think, but instead came out more like a thick chip. It was nice and crispy and the waitress made us a sauce of Sweet & Sour with Hot Mustard. It hit the spot nicely.
     We also had some Crab Puffs which we enjoyed.
     To best honest the highlight of the meal were the Summer Rolls. They were outstanding. I liked having the extra greens in it. 
     Then we shared the Garlic Chicken Stir-Fry. It was fantastic. Rich flavor and soft tender Chicken with lots of veg.
     It's a great little spot with some wonderful staff and excellent food. You will be happy when you leave."}
{"text":"Best pho ever I come here at least once a week for my fix lol I have tried so many others when they are closed or out of convenience and I can not find anything even close to as good . I love you Simis"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident most of the time I go up the street but man this place has the best food and the price is rite. You can't beat the lunch special rite amount of food and it's like five bucks and good. Give it a try you will thank me."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a good Asian food place to try, so we thought we would give this place a try. We pulled up and were a bit Leary because it looked run down. However looks can be deceiving!! We went in and the staff greeted us right away. I ordered the orange chicken and my husband ordered the curry chicken. It came out super fast and it was SO delicious!!!! We were very very impressed with the food!! I also ordered the fried tofu and loved it. My husband usually doesn't like tofu but he ate it too and liked it!! We will definitely be back for more!!! The food was so fresh!! Only thing that was a minus for here was that they didnt serve any alcohol, but it was still fabulous!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Food is great, atmosphere is relaxed, and the pricing is amazing. I used to frequent this place every weekend but sad I moved and I'm not able to go as often as I would like. I love the service I get from all of the staff. They are super friendly and just seem to put a smile on my face when ever I come in. They have never treated me wrong and they definitely deserve as much praise as they can get!"}
{"text":"First time trying it and it didn't disappoint.  We opted for take out so no dine in review, but the food was really good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! fast and friendly service. Will definitely visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I moved nearby about 6 months ago and have been on the search for good chinese, and on another note, good thai food. There are several thai places around and they've been okay. The one I really like is a little ways away and is a bit expensive. We finally tried this place that is actually walking distance from our house. 

I got the red curry and it was fantastic. I've got my thai place. 

Then my kid let's me try his orange chicken. And bam, I've got my chinese place. 

We will definitely be back. Diane was a great server. In fact, now that I think about it, the service was crazy good. She asked if I wanted more rice and before she'd left the table someone had some there. Same with the drinks. She asked the drinks then asked our order and by the time I was done with ordering, a guy showed up with my drink. I think she was punching the order into an iPad thing, but it was super quick. 

Anyway, fantastic. Great food. Great service. Oh and it's cheaper than the other thai place I liked."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I came for lunch. My waitress was very nice and tried to make sure I was happy with my temperature, seating, and food. She helped me pick out chicken on white rice with black bean sauce which was really good. The ambience was good and there televisions around for people to watch. The music played inside was 80s hits. There were a lot of customers and many seemed to be regulars who come very often which attests to how good this place is. The decor inside is pretty good and seems to have another half being worked on. I highly recommend this place. I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was underwhelmed with the entrees. The white rice was pretty dry. On a positive note,veggie egg rolls and crab puffs were good. Ok food with good prices."}
{"text":"My kinda of place quite and very peaceful atmosphere. I intend to return"}
{"text":"Good little Chinese joint. Great prices. Great service."}
{"text":"Fresh, cooked perfectly, super tasty.  Price/value is the best in Gilbert!  I will not forget the calamari fried with chili's, a must try! Ask for the simple dipping sauce half hot Chinese mustard and half sweet & sour....surprisingly fantastic!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for lunch and it was amazing. Great food for an even better deal. I had the orange chicken special and loved it. I could have used a bit more spice but still very enjoyable. 

I can't wait come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate an establishment twice but I just had the best PHO meat ball and beef .  I just cannot get over how delicious it is.  All ingredients are fresh and you can taste the freshness.  But no review is complete without saying how excellent the service is.  I never want for anything and always leave feeling like a king.  I started eating the lunch special on occasion.  Because of the amount of serving and the quality of taste, best lunch deal in AZ.  I eat here two to five times a week.  (single and no desire to cook), lol.  Enjoy your visit and say hi to Diane."}
{"text":"Trusted the yelp reviews to try this place for some pad thai.  Not sure what I received but it was not even edible.  The pad thai was sloppy and soupy."}
{"text":"I like the diversity of the menu.  My husband enjoyed Beef Pho while I had Mongolian Beef.  

Tasty pho with a sweetness.  Plenty of beef and sprouts.  

Free veggie egg rolls were ok.  Nothing I would  rush back for.

My Mongolian Beef had small strips of Beef.  I prefer larger and thinner pieces. There was more onions and Beef.  

Service was impeccable and friendly especially since we walked in 15 mins before they closed at 9pm.  

I'd come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I came here today and ordered spring rolls, they were really good. Small, but super fresh and good. I wish they added sprouts and cilantro, charged a buck more and made them larger (starving as I write this). My first time prior to this venture here I ordered a ton of stuff, not just spring rolls. The eggrolls here are excellent. They refer to their eggrolls as spring rolls and spring rolls as their summer rolls so use caution when ordering so you are not let down or pissed off. I know Thai restaurants use the summer roll reference term but this is not a Thai restaurant. Asian mix for sure though. They have a great lunch special that is mainly Chinese food and at $5.95 for a solid meal, you can't beat it. The establishment is really clean and modern, definitely could dine in here. The customer service is excellent. Thank you for the quick lunch fix and great service :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service.  Lunch plate for $4.99 includes egg roll & crab Rangoon and soup (they did forget to give me my soup and I didn't ask, but other customers got it.)  l liked my beef & broccoli very much.  The children ordered Pho - and that was gross.  Taste like out of packet and l and not a very good choices for meat to go with Pho.  It's not a pho place, but for lunch special  was a very good value."}
{"text":"This place is hidden, and a little run down on the outside but well worth looking past all that,  the food is excellent and the customer service is great.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Please believe the hype about \"Simi's Cafe\".  I am all about Yelp reviews and trust no other website. This Restaurant has 4.8 of 5 stars for a excellent reason. Today was my first time trying their food and let's just say that I was more than impressed.I had the Tom Yum Hot & Sour soup & the Kung Pao Shrimp w/out peanuts (due to preference).  I will definitely be there advocate for anyone who is looking for quality food. Do not hesitate to try their \"YUMMY FOOD\"."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time w/my family Bcus it's nearby and we wanted to try it out Bcus of all the great reviews n tips. I think we just found a awesome new spot. Food came out really fast. Service was amazing .I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"I go to Yelp for a lot of review on restaurants. Simi's Cafe which was surprising voted \"Best Chinese Food in the State\" (https://www.yahoo.com/food/the-best-chinese-food-restaurant-in-every-state-113883136081.html) was one of the WORST restaurants I've been to. Party of 2, we came here for lunch during the weekday. We were greeted and seated right away. Reviewing the menu, we went with choices that Simi's was famous for. We ordered the: Thai Seafood Tom Yum Soup, Orange Chicken and the Chicken Pad Thai.

Where do I start:

1. Thai Seafood Tom Yum Soup (Shrimp Scallops, Mussels, Calamari Fish mushroom lemongrass) for $11.00, I asked how big it was and was told it could feed 2-3 people. The soup came to our table in an impressive hot pot, but that was about it. I stirred it around a found a measly 2 Shrimp, 2 Scallops the size of my thumbnail, 2 Calamari slivers, NO Mussels, No Fish, oh a sliver of Chicken (when is chicken a seafood?) and a ton of Mushrooms. We brought it to our waitresses attention as she stood there with a blank face, went back to talk to the manager and comped us our soup. The most unappealing bowl of dishwater I've ever seen and had the gull to charge $11.00!

2. Orange Chicken (Breaded Chicken with Orange Peel Sauce) Hummm... the photo of this dish in the \"REVIEW\" was no where near the over fried chicken that was drenched in a sweet tasteless sauce.

3. Chicken Pad Thai (Chicken Rice noodles with Egg, Bean Sprouts, Onions and peanuts) when this arrived at our table it looked so unappealing I wasn't even going to try it. It didn't even smell good. I tried it, it was just about as BLAND as it looked. The tasteless chicken on a pile of gooey noodles.

I have never given such a bad review but I honestly think how on earth could this restaurant be voted \"Best Chinese Food in the State\" It had to be \"fixed\". Needless to say the waitress knew our discontent and did not charge us our meal as we left 90% of it on the table \"no take home boxes needed here\"."}
{"text":"I've never had wonton soup with noodles before.  The wontons and broth was good though.  The kung pau 2 was ok. It's not as good as the Kung pau at panda express. The iced tea was not good at all.  In general I would prefer to give this 3.5 stars but that is not possible.  I feel a little mislead by the 4.5 stars. I will probably come back to try the pho because it is hard to find in this area."}
{"text":"I love the orange chicken, the fried rice is also amazing. My wife always gets the Pho, yes this is a Chinese restaurant, the owner is Chinese and his wife is Vietnamese and makes the pho herself, it's amazing!!! Plus, the owner (she referred to herself as the owners wife) remembered us from our second visit on, very friendly. 

Today's visit... Dianne and the staff were great as usual. Food was excellent and came quick and hot!  Love this place, still five stars!"}
{"text":"Great place. Don't pay attention to the windowed which seems too be cardboard.  I think it got vandalized. Inside peaceful and great atmosphere,  clean, and great customer service! Food is also great for a more than decent price!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with my kids. We had been wanting to try this place for a while and were pleasantly surprised.
The server was really nice, very efficient and personable.
She brought our appetizer of spring rolls. We loved them, they came with the traditional peanut sauce, not overly stuffed with greens so that you can't taste the shrimp and pork. 

For dinner my son ordered the fried rice and was very happy with the flavor, it was different than most fried rice he has tried but he really liked it. (He likes to stick to one thing only)
I had the thai basil chicken. It was very delicious, I loved it! In fact I ate most of the chicken and still had a lot of onions and peppers that I gladly ate the next day over rice. 
My daughter ordered the Orange Chicken. Now, if you are expecting this to be a heavily breaded, overly sweet orange chicken, you shouldn't order this dish. Go to panda express instead. The chicken is thin, it is crispy and the orange sauce tastes like orange without being overwhelmingly sweet. My daughter and I loved it. 

The service was great, prices are very reasonable and the inside of the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Visited on 9/9/15:

I went there with several co-workers for lunch. The place is small but spacious, and had modern dark furniture. The staff was courteous, provided assistance with the menu, and quick to get our drink orders. They were using a tablet to take the orders, which make it go by much quicker and was useful when splitting up the check. They have a lunch special for $5, that included a spring roll, entree, and soup. When we finished our meals, we had to go to the bar to check out."}
{"text":"Been going here forever and it never disappoints.  They have great Chinese food, but the Vietnamese pho is where it is at.  I have never been a fan of soups, or hot liquids for that matter, but this soup has rice noodles and sliced beef.  You ad hoisin and Siracha to your liking and it's delicious.  If you like veggies they provide those as well and if you want a real spicy kick add some of those fresh jalapeños.  My other go to is the orange chicken.  It's unlike any I have had before, lightly breaded and great flavor.  Comes with rice.  Our other goto's are potstickers, fried calamari, summer rolls, and pretty much anything on the menu.  If you haven't tried them, go it's that good!"}
{"text":"The pho was fantastic as was the orange chicken. Thai iced tea was fresh and delicious. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great. We had the veggie spring rolls and the beef soup (pho) and Singapore noodles. We weren't disappointed"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in Baseline in Mesa.. if you aren't looking for it you'll miss it.

Service was fast and super friendly.. service is five star all day!!

The starter soup had a weird consistency .. like slimy or gummy. Flavor was ok but I couldn't get past the weird texture.

I had the chicken pad Thai and was asked if I was ok with fish sauce and peanuts (thanks for asking! And yes I am.. ) this tasted like a Chinese version of pad Thai it was missing the Thai basil, crunchy bean sprouts, fresh green onions, squirt of lime. The sauce was not pad Thai sauce.. it was a pale pasta color.. I wouldn't order it again and didn't finish it

This place did not make it to my roster of favorites."}
{"text":"My husband took my son and I to have dinner at Simi's Cafe last Saturday, September 9th 2017.   The customer service was exceptional at this establishment.  The restaurant is smaller with two flat screen televisions on the wall for entertainment.  They don't serve alcohol at this restaurant.  They are opening a nice sushi bar inside their current location. 

The menu has many items to choose from.  We started with chicken pot stickers and pork spring rolls. They were brought out right away with sauces and HOT mustard, my favorite.  They were deliciously crunchy and tasted amazing. 

For my dinner I ordered the Hong King style wonton and noodle soup.  My husband ordered kimchi udon noodle soup.  We also ordered sweet and sour pork to try it. My son ordered the orange chicken. 

All of these dishes were fresh, delicious and contained quality ingredients.  We were very pleased with the food and customer service from the staff. 

You will definitely leave with left overs from this restaurant which is always nice for a late night snack. The prices are reasonable.  We will definitely be back to eat again soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat Chinese food very nice employees would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the owners are so personable and sweet! They make it worth coming back to! The pho broth is probably the best I've had in the valley. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Our waitress Diane was awesome! :) we got chicken chow mein and beef and broccoli-cheap and yummy!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've had! Not dry and great flavor. Also had great pho here. On top of the food being delicious, this is the best service I've ever had! The ladies who work there are super nice every time I come in! Highly recommend :-)"}
{"text":"WOW! Food is amazing, service is awesome and atmosphere is very comfortable. We ordered, pot stickers, lemon chicken and shrimp with black bean sauce, everything was hot when it came out, food arrived quickly and food was amazing!

Looking forward to going back and having the orange chicken. Highly recommend it if you're looking for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best welcoming when you walk in. Owner makes you feel like you have been coming there for years. Great Pho. Hands down the best orange chicken I have ever had! Well done, you all really know what your doing!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Kung Pao shrimp is amazing! The lunch menu is so affordable and if you order in it even comes with a soup. The staff is very friendly and professional they will go above and beyond to please their customers, and they are overly appreciative. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Being from the San Francisco Bay area I'm pretty picky on Asian cuisine. I was pretty impressed first with the cleanliness of place, and how nice and attentive the staff were. Now to the food, and I have to say it was very good. We started the meal with some pot stickers followed with beef chow fun for me my girlfriend had the garlic chicken. the portions are enough to share and to enjoy the day after. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Took my family for dinner last night and all 6 of us ordered something different. The service was prompt and attentive and the staff was friendly. My green curry chicken was tasty with average warmth and zip, which was perfect. The General Tso's chicken was unusual by not being heavily breaded and with a light slightly tart flavor which allowed you to taste the meat rather than just deep fried breading. Overall a pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. So good about filling our water glasses throughout the night. Very prompt service, and our food was ready really quickly as well. Very clean restaurant. We ordered the orange chicken and the pho soup with beef. The portions were HUGE, especially for the price! $16 for two amazing meals. The food was delicious. We were brought more rice for the chicken and cilantro for the soup. Had such a great experience here. The friendly and attentive staff was really impressive and helped make it such a good experience. Love it!"}
{"text":"First time here. We came in right before they closed and we were welcomed warmly. We were surprised to be treated so nicely especially since it was so late. My husband ordered the orange chicken and I ordered the tum yum seafood soup. We had spring rolls and summer rolls. The quality was great, the rolls were fresh and very flavorful. My husband said the orange chicken was the best ever. Crispy texture with bright orange citrus flavor. My tum yum soup was very tasty and spicy just like I like it. I was served as much rice as I wanted (which was wonderful). The owner offered me jasmine tea which completed my meal perfectly. I highly recommend Simi's Cafe, the food is great and the service is comforting and warm."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place!!  Had an awesome dinner with friends.  Service was great.  Food is always delicious and fresh.  Orange chicken is so good! Pho soup is perfect. Love this place!  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Simi's is a family owned restaurant that's fairly new to Gilbert and has that heart warming welcome from the owners when you walk in. First impression you can tell right away that they genuinely care about their customers and appreciate the business as well. The restaurant has a modern high end look to it but doesn't hurt the wallet at all. When it comes to Simi's dishes they don't disappoint. They deliver generous portions of quality food at very reasonable prices. The one item on the menu that stood out for me was the sweet and sour soup. It was perfect! Thank you Simi's for a very enjoyable and pleasant dining experience. My wife and I look forward to coming in again soon!"}
{"text":"We eat here often, have been ordering from them for 4 years!  Still 5 stars, we have never had any issue with service or food, both are always excellent. They even make me Hot & Sour Soup without Tofu! Try the Shrimp & Snowpeas - best ever!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, $4.95 lunch specials with soup, entree, wonton and spring roll. Wonderful wait staff."}
{"text":"Get the won-ton soup, it is fantastic. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here once but I'm already in love with this place. Decoration is very nice inside, don't let the outside fool you! The people who work here are super nice which is probably why I'll be coming back. The food is great and such a variety of options on the menu. Just such a great place overall."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!
At least once a week we come for the Orange Chicken, Chow Main & Yellow Curry! Best in the valley!  Service is great!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Price is good. We don't go there often because there is a place closer to the house."}
{"text":"Simi's is fabulous. Everyone is so friendly and provides great service whether you are dining in or getting take out.  Restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's clean and decorated nicely inside. Good place for families. Try the orange chicken- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally!!!  A restaurant in East Mesa/Gilbert that serves Pho!  I have been searching and searching for Pho on the east side of Mesa for years, but it seems like all of the Vietnamese restaurants are centered around the Dobson/Alma School area which is not exactly convenient for people like me that live further east.

I stumbled onto Simi's Cafe on my way home from work yesterday when I noticed a \"Now Open\" sign and decided to give it a try.  I must say it was not disappointed!  For starters, I had the Goi Cuon Spring Rolls and Tom Yum Soup which were delicious (the Tom Yum Soup reminded me of how my mother used to make it).  For the main course, I ordered the Pho Tai which came in a large bowl.  It was surprisingly flavorful and aromatic (not like many of the bland Pho establishments in town...) and the noodles were just right--not too mushy or stuck together like a rice patty.

This restaurant is on the site of the previous Jasmine Cafe and the new owners have completely renovated the restaurant with a modern/fusion feel.  Aside from Pho, they also serve Thai and Chinese dishes.  I'll definitely be back again to try many of their other dishes.  If you're craving some Pho on the east side of town, I would definitely check this place out.  I recommend the Pho Tai and Goi Cuon."}
{"text":"First time eating here, AWESOME! Way better than other chinese restuarants we've tried. Stop by this place is great!"}
{"text":"Really great. Family oriented feel. Food was great and the service was so nice as well as fast! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"this was my first time here and the food was so good. my friend and I ordered hot n sour soup, fried tofu, beef fried rice, pork chow fun, and Vietnamese coffee. Yum!! All of them tasted so good. The lady recommended beef noodle soup that I will definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"cashew chicken had really good flavor and tender, but well-cooked chicken! hot and sour soup was good; like 'traditional' hot and sour soup i remember, but have had a hard time finding til now. it could be a little spicer, but still good flavor and happy to find it.

the pork wasn't so good; it was just way too fatty.  the fried rice was meh, because it was good at first, but then it had a bit of a fishy or something aftertaste. ill give it another try to see next time. and, i do think they need to add more meat to the dishes. both our main dishes had an over abundance of onions and carrots. for a meat n veggie dish thats one thing, but something like sweet n sour or orange chicken, should have more meat than filler veggies.  we will be back though and look forward to trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Pho get about it your other Asian spot. Do not be fooled by the outside (landlord needs to update) as for Simis does a fine job inside from decor to taste. Great service and very helpful. Clean family owned and operated of course. So good!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I just ate here and enjoyed the food and service. Won ton noodle soup, pad thai, and green curry chicken were delicious. Would like to come back and try the Pho. Service was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and Diane is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She always smiles and remembers who you are when you come in. I love the variety of food here and the great priced lunch menu."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find that special place where the staff is so damn awesome and friendly that you have to write about it!  
The food is amazing!  The orange chicken is to die for!  Egg rolls are amazing as well!  Yet even though the food was amazing the service was better!  You might ask, how can this be?  It just is!  Please go experience this awesome dining experience and see what I am talking about!
We will go back again and soon!
Mmmmmmmmm yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night.  We were seated right away which was nice.  

Appetizers came out and only minutes later our entries were delivered.  I really would have preferred that they gave us more time to finish the appetizers since the table was small.

The water in my cup and the ice in my daughter's sprite tasted bad.

My wife loved her Pho Thai.  I enjoyed my Red Curry, but they only gave a tiny ball of rice to go with it.  Our server never stopped by to ask if everything was ok or ask if we needed anything.

Towards the end, I asked for more more napkins since we did have a 4 year old.  She came back with 2 paper napkins.

The food was tasty, but the service wasn't great.  Decor was ok.  If I return, it's only for the tasty food."}
{"text":"pretty good food. We always have the pho and orange chicken. close to home? always the goto location when in a hurry"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal and the customer service is amazing! Our favorite dish is the orange chicken but there isn't anything on the menu we haven't liked!!!"}
{"text":"Recently moved here from CA where Pho options are limitless.  We were worried we wouldn't be able to find  anything comparable to our fav OC spots.  Simi cafe not only fills the void for us with amazing Pho, but the owner is honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met.  She always remembers everyone and goes out of her way to make you feel welcome.  Everyone always goes out of their way to make sure you've got what you need, especially for your kids.  Which is so great! Awesome customer service & amazing Pho.  Our new Fav"}
{"text":"The food at Simi's is fantastic!  I have not had something that was not great!  I love this place and the staff is so so friendly.  You must check this place out and try the PHO!  Oh and everything else!  Once you go you will probably become a regular!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the last three times it has not been good at all. Tonight's take out was awful... my cashew chicken was literally all celery and peppers even with red peppers and taste like kungpao... the crispy spring rolls I love were awful missing something definitely.. even the fish sauce no good... my house noodles were not fried well still rubbery and greasy... unfortunately I was a weekly customer that won't be back and will never refer. Bye Susie and Chris."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Pho in the valley! Everyone in my family has something they love on the menu. The service is phenomenal. Customizing your dish is a breeze. The restaurant is clean & lovely. They're closed on Sunday (). 

Give Simi's a try. You'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho. Rich, deep flavors. The Dak Biet Xe Lua and crab puffs were great. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Very good food & such a sweet, attentive server. Def recommend the Thai Tea, banana smoothie, Orange Chicken & Basil Chicken !"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while for the lunch specials they are consistently awesome, super nice service really excellently cooked lunch specials"}
{"text":"Very good chinese. My daughter had the orange chicken. It was crunchy and delicious. I had the Mongolian beef, which had a very good flavor. The price was good. I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent no-fuss eating. Staff is supremely friendly and the food is excellent. It's not high-end but it's delicious and fast and clean."}
{"text":"I am so lucky to have found Simi's Cafe. Diane is a class act. It's rare to find a place that remembers its customers and cares about them. Of all the times I have visited I have yet to experience any problem. The food is great and the people make it even better."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant!!! The food is amazing the price is fantastic!! And the service is absolutely the best in town. From the moment you walk in till the moment you walk out, you won't find better service anywhere! If you haven't eaten here you're missing out on a great experience!! Thank you thank you thank you!!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff! Not to mention they have very good food. I've explored numerous items on the menu but my very favorite is the Hong Kong soup. Get it with extra wontons. Lil sriracha and just Bliss"}
{"text":"Quick, delicious lunch. Exceptional customer service!  We were in and out in 20 minutes.  Great prices!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for only $5.95

I ordered the General Tso's chicken. I know it's not really Chinese food, but I like it.

It didn't have a fried crispy layer over the chicken, but the sauce was good.

Decent portion for a small lunch. It comes with egg drop soup, an egg roll and wonton. 

The waitress was friendly.. very quiet in here. We were the only ones here.

Free egg rolls when you check in!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  The orange chicken and beef pho are my favorites. I try to get in at least once a week. Love it!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food has been excellent both times. The staff is also very friendly. I will be going back."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here recently for dinner and we all unanimously agreed that the service was impeccable. Diane did a great job explaining different options we had (we were vegetarian) and developed a friendly banter with the group.

One of our friends didn't realize his order had eggs and the kitchen remade the dish quickly.

We ordered the drunken noodles and they were good. Portions were big and the price was fair.

The ambiance was nice. We'll be back.

Keep up the good work, SImi's Cafe, Diane, and team."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews but completely disappointed.  Chicken tasted really funny with strange texture in Curry Chicken my son ordered."}
{"text":"First time here, found it on Yelp. I ordered Pho tai and Summer Rolls. Very happy with my choices and this place. I will be back!"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL!!!  We went to Simi's since it was near our new home... SOOO surprised!!!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers then back to get more...  Great food, great service."}
{"text":"We had the fried calamari appetizer, beef pho, and seafood pad thai. They were all great!  The staff was super friendly and took the time to explain the dishes to us and make recommendations.  Even helped me make a sauce for the pho. I highly recommend this place,  I just wished I lived in town to go every week!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service! The Orange Chicken and Hot & Sour Soup were very tasty & not at all spicy! The restroom was very clean - always a good sign!"}
{"text":"The Best place ever!  Great service and splendid food. Bring the family and relax.  

I'm usually a person that just orders the pho and beef. My wife orders something different each time we visit. We bring our two daughters (both under 5) and I cannot be happier with a restaurant. 

Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for almost five years now! I can't believe it! Diane and Albert are always great. Food is always good and we have probably had almost everything on the menu.
If you're a pokè lover like myself, you must check this place out. Inside the restaurant, there is a new addition that features a poke bar and you can customize your own pokè bowl. Fish and vegetables are fresh!"}
{"text":"Ordered three takeout meals from them for me and a couple coworkers, couldn't be happier with how good it was. $5 lunch special for an entree, rice, a spring roll, and a crab rangoon?! Amazing! Also, their summer rolls are to die for. The veggies were crisp and the sauce they included was delicious. When I showed up to pick up the food, they were quick and and very polite. Definitely going to try and get dinner here soon. This is definitely a concrete lunch location for me and my coworkers now!"}
{"text":"OH BOY. This place is phenomenal. Food is fresh and delicious, service is LIGHTNING fast, and hospitality is nothing short of amazing. 

 I HOPE YOUR'E NOT A PESSIMIST IF YOU COME HERE. Because my water glass was NEVER HALF EMPTY. They are really good at making sure you have enough water. Servers are always checking on you to make sure everything tastes good and you're getting what you desire. Extra rice? They got that. Extra sauce? They're dripping in sauce. Need a box? Diana will box you up son. 

Recently moved around the neighborhood and after two visits I know I will become a regular at this place. If you plan to visit...bring an extinguisher because this place is FIRE."}
{"text":"To say I frequent Simi's is an understatement... I LOVE this place! I either get the sliced beef Pho or the pork vermicelli and always get an order of the summer spring rolls. I can't speak more highly of this cafe, the staff and food are just amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good for vegetarians!

The service is good and the food is great! Love this place! It's the best for Chinese Thursdays!"}
{"text":"My first time at Simis today and it was so good! I can't believe it took me this long to eat here considering I live so close to it. The restaurant is perfectly dimmed with nice furniture, an open bar area where they make home made teas and they have a few tvs throughout the restaurant. It is a smile restaurant but that's all you need when the food is so delicious. It was lunch time when I went and the restaurant was a little full but I got sat and served right away. The lunch specials were only $4.99, and looked awesome, but I went there for the pho. I ordered the crab puffs which were some of the best I've had. Nice amount of filing. The pho was so yummy! Exactly what I was looking for to cure my slight hangover on a cold day. The veggies were crunchy and fresh and the broth was piping hot and spicy. So delicious I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Customer service was impeccable. Food was fresh and tasty. Restaurant was clean. If I lived here I would eat there more often."}
{"text":"I feel like I am back in Singapore when I eat here. Tasty food. Great service.

I ordered vegan pad Thai with no tofu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very affordable lunch special with a variety of options! I do wish they had some of their Thai dishes in there though and not just Chinese. I tried their sweet and sour which came with a spring roll, a crab puff and soup. It was extremely generous portion size for 6.50 (including tax). The staff was very attentive and kind. From the outside you don't expect to walk into such a nice place. It was packed today and I look forward to going again and taking friends!"}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy the food here. I came for lunch one day because I was in the area. Is it cheap? Yes. Was it quick? Yes. Was it good? Well.....define good. It was edible, but in terms of quality Asian food, I guess you get what you pay for.  The service was great and the staff was super friendly, which seems to be the consensus, but I came to expect a level of somewhat decent dishes and was disappointed. The pirtions were small as well. I guess I'm used to having leftovers, and there was barely enough just to hold me over til dinner.  I'll try it again another time as I know places can have off days."}
{"text":"I am so glad I stumbled upon this hidden gem called Simi's Cafe! This place was so comfortable and the food was amazing! 

My husband and I came here Friday night and we're greeted and seated right away. The service was excellent and the staff was incredibly friendly.

We ordered the House Pan Fried Noodles, Black Pepper Beef and Ma Po Tofu. The waitress heard us say we enjoy spicy so she made it a priority to make everything spicy. It was fantastic! 

I can't stress how flavorful each of the dishes were but I can tell you that I can't wait to go back and try more! Overall - the food was amazing but something that must be recognized is the staff and service. Our waitress (I wish I got her name) was so sweet and made it a priority to make everyone comfortable and enjoy their experience."}
{"text":"Walked in here I get a greeting already and they sit us at a table right away! Our server asked if we have been to this restaurant before we said it was our first. We told her we yelped what's good to eat in mesa and this restaurant popped up. I love how they have 3 variety of asian cusines. THAI, VIET, AND CHINESE FOOD! We checked in on yelp and got free veggie egg rolls.. It was so good!! Then for the appetizer, we had bbq beef which had two sauces on the side. One was sweet and the other one was like a mustard wasabi flavored which I wouldn't recommend trying because it had a strong taste and it wasn't good at all. But the bbq was marinated perfectly and it was juicy. No need for sauce! For dinner, we ordered seafood pan fried noodle, thai chicken basil, and spicy mogolian beef. All three were amazing. Just wow! The server also kept checking up on us to make sure we're enjoying our dinner and asked if we need anything else. After our dinner, she asked how the food was making a lil convo with us. I love that she's very open and actually talks to their customers.. She also wrapped all of our left overs. Usually most restaurants just gives you the box and plastic so you have to wrap your food yourself. Great food and great service. 5 stars! Especially our  first visit here.  Definitely will be back : )"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to come here for lunch.  Big mistake.  It appears there is one person who takes orders, busses, and cooks.  Took a while to get our menus.  I ordered the seafood Tom yum soup and my wife ordered the vegetable lo mein.  I also ordered a side of spring rolls.  I may be wrong but I thought spring rolls were not deep fried. These were deep fried and greasy.  My wife's lo mein tasted like top ramen.  My $11.00 bowl of soup had a smidgen of seafood.  Not worth the price.  So sad.  But another one off my list."}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch here prior to heading to the Lantern Festival. Our party of 9 were seated at the high top tables in the poke bar side of the establishment. My friends Nicole (Nikki) and Mike are regulars at Simi's Cafe and have always raved about their delicious food and excellent service. We were just in town for the weekend so they made sure we got to sample what they love so much about it. 

We started off with tsukemono which is Japanese style pickled vegetables. I liked it all except the seaweed looking plant. That didnt taste good in this otherwise great starter. Some of our party got poke bowls and they are huge. My good friend Nikki gets these poke bowl's from Simi's a few times a week. She is a super regular. Ha! The fish looked fresh, the portions are huge and the toppings options were plentiful.

On to the other food. We had filet mignon in XO sauce and that was very tasty & tender. It's served with string beans, bell peppers and onions. Good flavor. We also got their house special fried rice and that comes with amongst other things bbq pork, chicken and shrimp. It was a good fried rice dish and the portion was generous. Others in our party also got pho as their main entree. My niece is a vegetarian so the tofu in their vegetable pho is perfect. We also got the roasted prawns and crab legs in a chili sauce. Wow... This dish is huge and can feed a whole army. Great flavor and good spice to it as well. We also got a sushi crunch roll that was topped with crab and eel sauce. I dont know the exact name of it but we ordered another one for the table. It was good. 

What I enjoyed most with the food we had was something special Albert the owner cooked up for us visitors from LA. He had cooked duck breast with fried rice and a sweet sauce. It was delicious. I even saw Albert use a torch to caremelize the skin of the duck. It was great. The duck was tender, had lots of flavor and I just simply couldnt get enough of it. 

The customer service was excellent. Albert and his family (staff) were so attentive. I really cant say enough of how nice they treat their customers. I see now why my friends are such regulars there. Great food and even better customer service."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken!! The service and employees were wonderful! Took the family there for take out. They gave the little kids a sucker and water while waiting. Helped us to the car with the food! Hands down a must go!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff! Clean restaurant as well very inviting for a dinner date or quick lunch. Just grabbing lunch Togo today but I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yummy calamari!  Not traditional Thai but our favorite Thai dishes: pad Thai and Thai basil were very good.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yes!! We finally found an awesome chinese restaurant in Gilbert! Orange chicken is one of the best I've ever had and  I've eaten a lot of it. It's my go-to dish when testing out new restaurants. Definitely the best I've had in the valley. My husband had the house fried rice and thought it needed more soy sauce...but not enough to get off the couch and add a few dashes so it must not have been lacking too much.  The crab puffs were very good with a light, thin, crunchy exterior and generous filling."}
{"text":"The food is Awesome! I really like the curry - several kinds. Orange chicken best in town. People are very friendly..."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!  By far the best Asian food I've ever had!!  Cashew Chicken and Orange Chicken are so good!!!  :-)

Diane, the owner, was so nice and so helpful!  This will be our new go to for sure!!!!

:-)"}
{"text":"We love this place! The owner is super sweet and always remembers us when we come in, or order takeout! I'm a vegetarian and they are very cognizant of veggie options! Try the Pho, it's \"Pho-nomenonal\"."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying the chicken pho at Simi's. I found it really good. The noodles were firm, the broth had a good flavor and the flavors all seemed fresh. I really liked the chili paste as it came in a bowl and tasted better than the stuff some places have in squirt bottles. The chicken was kind of odd. Not bad odd - but it had a slippery boiled texture. The pork spring rolls were also very tasty. Service was great and friendly and the dining room was clean. I would still rate Unphogettable a little higher, but they have two different tastes and both are very good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat when traveling through Mesa.  Excellent food and service!  Would recommend to anyone looking for good quality, good tasting, reasonably priced Asian food!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight and it was excellent!

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful; very clean and beautifully decorated. The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant.

I order a Thai tea (soooo good), crab puffs, and chicken pad Thai. My husband ordered the chow mein. The food was excellent, and the portions were very large.

I highly recommend Simi's cafe! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time here after trying Vietnamese dishes in Seattle earlier this summer. Was hoping the Beef Pho was just a great here and it was! 

I ordered the Beef Pho with sliced beef. Piping hot & delicious with very fresh Basil, Bean Sprouts, Jalapeños and onion. Yum!

Ordered Pork Spring Rolls and also received a free order of Vegetable Rolls for my Yelp! check-in. Full of flavor, not greasy at all. Served with a variety of fresh made sauces.

Service was awesome with very friendly & smiling server. 

Order to ready in less than 10 minutes. 

Great menu with a wide selection of entrees, appetizers and soups. Very reasonably priced!

Highly recommended! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is da bomb - the food was amazing - very flavorful and fresh and the prices are great - I have dietary issues and they were very helpful (making my black pepper chicken with gluten free garlic sauce instead of the regular sauce) the owner/ chef came out to the dinning room as we finished our meal and we had a chance to talk to him for a bit - he even explained how he makes one of his sauces to my daughter who is in culinary school and encouraged her to keep on cooking. The waitress was very sweet and helpful - including getting gloves and showing my daughter how to properly properly wrap the spring rolls in lettuce and mint for maximum flavor. All in all we were very pleased with both the food quality and the service. We arrived rather late only a half hour before close and at no time did we feel like they were rushing us out the door so that they could close up."}
{"text":"Third time here, the food is delicious. I had General TsO's chicken egg roll yummy and the crab Rangoon and the egg drop soup was the best I have ever had, I ordered hot and sour soup to go as it one of  My favorites .Hope it is is as good as Lotus Chinese in Huntington Beach, Ca. I miss my favorite place and the people who own and work there, I have known for many years and was always treated like Family, When my husband was in Hospice card they'd sent food home with me all the time, this will be my favorite now. TEresa"}
{"text":"Family own restaurant, with a friendly atmosphere, amazing food that you can't ever go wrong choosing. Great for having lunch by yourself or in a large group. Friendly and  warm welcoming people. 

A must try in my book!!"}
{"text":"Thai iced tea is great!!!!
Spring rolls are also good
Love the fresh orange chicken very crispy not soggy like others 
And the seafood noodle soup is great cause they put a lot of seafood there not shy :-) would recommend this"}
{"text":"You will feel like being served in Singapore airlines by the server/owner who will take great care of you.  She was extremely attentive and asked how I knew about her place and I was told it was introduced by a friend.  Now the food.  NOT a fan of her Pho because the broth was not made well which is too light for my taste.  However, their Chinese dishes are excellent and their wontons are the ones that looked like goldfish which I only saw in Asia and their noodles are great so I will highly recommend their Chinese dishes instead of Vietnamese.  I will also try the Thai dishes later."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight for the first time. It will not be the last. Honestly, it might not be the last time this week!
 
Food: I ordered the orange peel chicken. If you are looking for the fake orange colored, generic orange sauce, this isn't for you. The sauce was delicious, the chicken was beyond plentiful. They will bring you more rice if you need it. I also had an order of their summer rolls, which were super fresh and large in size. I will definitely order them again. 

Service: Exceptional. The waitress was fast on her feet, kept refills of drinks coming, and even gave me a to-go cup of tea without me even asking. She knew many of the other patrons there, and appeared genuinely interested in how they had been doing since they were last in. I love that. She also asked if it was my first time in (yes). She asked if I was concerned that there weren't very many people there when I came in, if that worried me. I answered that it might, in some instances, but would always give a place a chance. I explained that it was late in the evening, on a Monday, and clearly they had a solid, loyal clientele. They also had a steady amount if take out orders being picked up throughout my stay. I liked that she was interested enough to ask me that question. 

It was delicious. It was plentiful in quantity. It was the right price. I am a happy lady and will be back."}
{"text":"While \"home\" for the holidays I was really craving pho. I grabbed my daughter to set out and find some. Armed with our iPhones and Yelp app we found Simi's Cafe. I've only ever had pho at 1 other restaurant so I don't have a ton to compare it to, but it was great. The ingredients were fresh and the price was perfect. My daughter ordered the orange peel chicken and said that it was the best she has ever had. It was only $4.99 on the lunch special menu. The staff was friendly and attentive. When I'm home, I'll be going back to try more dishes. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best green coconut curry chicken in Arizona!   Chicken was tender,  green beans were fresh and the curry had the perfect amount of spice.   My young daughter had the orange chicken lunch special and the price was outstanding!   She loved the food.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.   Oh,  the service was extraordinary and the food was served quickly.  Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"So, it was my birthday, late in the evening on a weekday and my friend wants to take me to dinner. Couldn't find anywhere to go. I thought that most restaurants close at 10pm. We happen by Simi's Cafe and stop in. Well, it was 8:50 and they close at 9:00. We apologized and started to leave. The person at the counter says for us to please sit wherever we like and they are happy to have us. I was skeptical because everyone wants to go home, so you are going to get fast, tasteless food. 

We ordered the Crab Rangoon, Vegetable Noodles and Orange Chicken. What a shock! The Crab Rangoons were the best I have ever tasted! No wet, soggy mess! I didn't know that they could be made to not be wet!

The noodles were the thin and again, not the wet soggy mess! Who knew that noodles aren't always large and soupy! The vegetables were cooked to perfection!

The Orange Chicken is very different. It is thinly sliced, very crispy, with a light glaze. The waitress was concerned as we looked closely at it and said she could add sauce if we wanted. I did not want it changed.

During our visit the people were just so nice! They were so concerned about our experience and how we wanted our food prepared! We kept them past closing and yet they asked if it would bother us if they mopped the back or cleaned tables!

This restaurant looks like nothing from the road, which is right on Baseline. You pass it every day and never notice it. The interior is very clean and comfortable. These are all very good reasons to visit, but the main reasons:

                Unbelievable food and the fabulous staff!

I actually hesitated doing a review because it appears that it is a hidden gem and I did not want everyone showing up and then making it difficult to get in, but this restaurant deserves much more attention then it gets!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Cantonese  restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes.  We visited for the first time and were greatly impressed the restaurant is very clean and the food was very good. I had pad Thai and the noodles were amazing. The staff is so friendly and helpful.  We are so glad we read other reviews and tried this place. I hope by my review you will eat there too."}
{"text":"Possibly my new favorite Thai/Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley! Great interior, wonderful staff, and delicious food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Legit.  Hong Kong noodles with dumplings are winner."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, been bookmarked for months.
Unappealing strip center location, and entry probably keep some people away. Too bad for them!
Interior very nice, modern,  clean and spacious.
Was greeted and seated immediately by very nice staff. Ordered drinks and appetizers, which arrived quickly.
Chinese chicken wrap, just plain delicious!
Tasty dipping sauce and fresh lettuce to roll up. Would have liked some sprouts and pickled veg on the side.
Pork spring rolls, crunchy, tasty.
Crab puffs, fresh and crispy.
Wife had teriyaki chicken bowl. Enjoyed, but thought it needed more flavor.
My Singapore rice noodles were very good.
Good value, good ingredients.
Our server, Diane was very friendly and attentive, a real professional.
We will most definitely return. Look forward to trying everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Simply yummy! I love everything I e had. The orange chicken; beef and broccoli. All the soups are amazing!"}
{"text":"Still a great experience whenever I come here. I always enjoy the food and have to start the meal with some of their summer rolls. Then depending on my mood the pho or eggplant and pork."}
{"text":"WHY HAVE I NEVER BEEN HERE?! 

This place is amazing! Their prices are incredibly reasonable for fantastic food. The service was outstanding. This staff was so friendly, and made sure we always had everything we needed with huge smiles on their faces. You seriously pay $5.95 for a lunch special that includes your meal, rice, soup, crab wonton, and a spring roll! It doesn't get better. The restaurant is so clean, and extremely nice too! A perfect little hidden gem in Gilbert :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice now. I really like it, the staff is very friendly and family owned I believe. I had the beef pho both times add lots of veggies, I'm definitely a fan. He had the chicken fried rice first time, wasn't a fan, second time wonton soup with sliced beef and it was really good! Portions of soup are more enough to fill you up. Also the egg drop soup is very good! Everything very fresh too, and great prices for quality and quantity of what you get. Will definitely continue to get my soup fix here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. This is my go to place. I've ordered lots of thing off their menu and have never been disappointed. Their Thai basil chicken is to die for. If your a vegetarian then you'll love their sautéed tofu and vegetables. Their pho is among the best I've tried in the valley and the closest thing I've had to food in Asia. If you've never been here , then what are you waiting for?! Double time!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves great food and the service is equally great. I eat lunch here at least once a week."}
{"text":"An enjoyable experience with fabulous food. Make no mistakes, this is an Asian Cafe, not a fancy restaurant. However the food and the staff were wonderful. The menu includes most Asian favorites including Pho, Cantonese, Japanese & Thai. I had the Seafood Chow Fun. The scallops (larger than I expected) were melt in the mouth. Everyone in my party raved about their food (Seafood Pho, General Tao's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken)."}
{"text":"WOW, I can't say enough about this place !!  The food is fantastic.  I've had the Thai Basil Chicken and the Yellow Curry Chicken.  Both were FANTASTIC !!!    I took a large group of people there and the serve was wonderful.  Our waitress was so sweet and really on top of things !  Please go if you haven't been !"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch time was sat quickly, the service was awesome. Honestly some of the nicest and best service I have ever gotten at a restaurant. We came here for the pho tai which was wonderful. Definitely gonna come back to try some of the other food on the menu. Plus 4.99$ lunch special is really cheap."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Staff was very attentive and on top of it. Their lunch specials were inexpensive and tasty! Came with 1 crab rangoon, egg roll and soup. The soup was the only item to me that was not as tasty to me. I ordered the terriyaki chicken and it was served with rice and veggies. The sauce was a perfect balance of sweetness and not overpowering. 

And if you like vietnamese coffee or want to try it, come here! Iced or hot! My friend ordered it and it was yummy! 

Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, of coarse my boyfriends plate tastes better but both were really good. Large portions, the iced coffee could have been sweeter but it was still good. I wanted to try the smoothie bar but I was too full. . .maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good Pho place since moving from California & this place is it.

Food isn't salty, it's tastes fresh, & their Vietnamese coffee is on point. Beef combination is usually my go to & this doesn't disappoint. 

& what really makes this different from California is their staff is actually friendly! Their customer service is top notch. The ladies made sure our waters were never low, checked in to make sure our food was good, & even made recommendations based on what they observed about us. 

This is a new regular spot."}
