{"text":"This place has delicious, delicious food. They have such a huge menu it's so tempting! Everything from sandwiches to jerk chicken to plantain. I got the jerk chicken, spinach rice and grilled vegetables, the veggies weren't much although. But loved it overall. The manager gave us free cheesecake even after we failed his trivia! He was really nice and the food was super delicious! I would recommend this any day/any time. I wish I would have found it sooner! Keep cookin'"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork periogies and they were to die for! I also grabbed a side of rice and peas which had no flavour and dry as a bone!! We also had the apple crumble no \"crumble\"maybe just soggy? And the deep fried cheese cake with strawberries when it came it was warm and tasted great with or without the strawberries however it was a super small portion for $8!! Regardless how tasty it was I'll never order it again but I'll definetly be returning to check out their other menu items"}
{"text":"Got a phone call as soon as i placed an order online. Guy challenges me to a quiz, and if i get all the questions right I get my meal for free. i lost but still got a free side. 10/10"}
{"text":"First time ordering and won't be ordering again.  There's few things more disgusting concerning food than hair in it.  Bit into a spring roll and out slides a long hair.  I called the place, they don't make them in house so that's a bit of a relief, but I wouldn't order the spring rolls if you go here.  The other dishes were just ok.  The reason for 3 stars is the drink I ordered they didn't have so they threw in 2 free drinks.  And the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Asked for extra extra extra spicy jerk chicken.....not even \"mild\" would be a good idea to describe the chicken.  I make it betta with a bottle of Walker's from the supermarket. Chicken was tasteless. Ribs were 90% bone and grizzle. Macaroni was good but I don't order from a Caribbean restaurant to get a plate of pasta. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery through Just Eat.

The food was DELICIOUS. Had the fried chicken with macaroni, and jerk salmon. The customer service is over the top. Very sweet people. Wish I could stay in Toronto longer so I could try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time.  The owner Horace is really friendly.  I ordered pan seared tilapia first with plantain.  It was really delicious.  The fish was moist and nicely seasoned, and the plantain was perfectly done!  The food was also quite affordable.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered through JustEat and it took 2 hrs. Called the restaurant multiple times and the staff was b*tchy af.  All her responses were \"the order is on its way\" when asked how long will it take, what happens if the order doesn't get here on time, what if I wanna cancel. Food was barely on the warm side."}
{"text":"Oh man o man! this is the first review i have written and absolutely divine! best thing ever, i get a call from the restaurant after having made an order, a real cool guy who called to make my day. and quite honestly, he did! started off with a few trivia type questions for a free meal! after i had failed those (no cheating!) he said he wanted to make my day anwyays and gave the choice of a side for free! 

the food itself - tops! quick delivery, got the jerk chicken roti and well, definitely getting food from here again! delicious and juicy and a great portion! an amazing way to turn up an otherwise exhausting day!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood a week ago and I walked around the corner to get some takeout for dinner for my husband and I.  Each of us had the 1/4 Jerk Chicken with Rice (it comes with plantain too, which was a nice surprise when I got home!) and everything was under $16 with tax.  The owner was super nice and friendly and chatted as the food was being prepared.  He asked if we wanted it spicy (yes!)

I can't describe how incredibly delicious the food was.  To be fair, I'm not from the Caribbean but I've always enjoyed Jerk Chicken (we even went to the Jerk Festival one year and lined up for hours altogether) and this was the absolute tastiest I've ever tried, by far.  Just... I mean, we were hoping to sample all the different places (this is the second we tried) but I feel we've found our place.  There's no need to try anywhere else.

The menu is a little overwhelming (and not super well organized - I saw Roti too late) but I think they must just be trying things out to see what sells.  They also have Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream, which is going to come in handy this summer."}
{"text":"Ordered from ubereats. Got the jerk chicken and rice with a broccoli slaw. Both were greatS The owner called when it was getting ready and offered me the chance to answer a trivia question for some extra food. Ended up getting a cheesecake which was outstanding. Will order again."}
{"text":"Decided to try the new spot on the block. Happy I did. Horace, the owner and chef was fun-loving and very welcoming. We took out jerk chicken w/ rice and peas and a jerk pork roti. 

The chicken was incredibly tender, the roti was fantastic. Spicy pork (think pulled pork tender) and a creamy slaw of cabbage, carrot, broccoli wrapped in a roti. The flavour and texture combo may have been unconventional for a roti but I loved it. 

Horace also gave us a piece of BBQ chicken and sweet potato mash to sample, both delicious as well. The BBQ sauce tasted homemade and deep in flavour and the mash reminded me of thanksgiving dinner...rich and cinnamony. 

While the menu seems very scattered (pierogies, poutine and wings on the same menu as jerk chicken & roti), I think they're still sorting things out and hopefully will get it right. Regardless, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Just Eat.  Was teetering between a 3 star and a 4 star rating, because the delivery was very slow and I wouldn't say that it's quite all that authentic.  Settled on 4 stars because I really did enjoy my meal, even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.

Delivery - In all fairness, I'm not all that close to this restaurant, so I can see delivery taking a bit longer, though this was still a bit too long.  However, when I did place my order and they accepted it, the delivery time was stated and was delivered a few minutes earlier than the expected delivery time.  I placed my order at 10:10pm, got it at 11:30pm with the expected delivery being 11:36pm.  Delivery person was polite & professional. Food was not cold as some other reviewers had mentioned.

Packaging -  The free broccoli slaw was packed in a styrofoam container, all other items were in lidded plastic containers.  Was packed away very nicely and was neat.  All containers plastered with labels.  Plastic containers had \"thank you so much\" labels on it and the large paper bag had the investors label on it.

I ordered three items, jerk chicken roti, brisket poutine and pierogies.

Pierogies - Pretty standard, but did not disappoint.  Good amount of sauteed bacon & onions on top.  The bacon & onions really made it.

Brisket poutine - The brisket was great, and so was the poutine.  Also had some sauteed onions which made it a bit on the sweet side, though I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Jerk chicken roti - Very tasty, however, this is where they loose points for authenticity.  I was expecting it to be spicy as it had jerk chicken, however, I barely felt a tingle on my tongue.  It did taste great and I did enjoy it, but was expecting it to be at least a little bit spicy.

Broccoli slaw - There was no mayo or vinegar, it seemed to be tossed with a bit of sugar as it was on the sweet side.  I do not normally like slaw, but I did like this one.  However, others in the party that did like slaw were not a fan of this one as it was too sweet for them.

As long as I'm not starving and can't wait the hour and a half, I would order here again."}
{"text":"I love Seg'z! The food is AMAZING and the staff are super friendly. Sometimes after you place an order they will call you and offer your meal for free if you can answer a pop quiz question (or two). You can tell they really care about their customers; they're so friendly and fun to speak to on the phone! The orders do take 60-75 mins but it's totally worth it -- the menu has lots of variety and the pulled pork and brisket items are so tasty! (I always order lots so I have leftovers for the rest of the week.) Give Seg'z a chance if you're in the mood for good grub!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price! I've ordered several times for instance this evening. I received a call shortly after and had an opportunity to talk to a hilarious gentlemen who quizzed me for a chance to win a free dinner! Who else has this sort of customer service to go along with quality? The jerk chicken and brisket are mouth watering and I will always go back. Solid experience and atmosphere that you won't find anywhere else in Toronto, can't rave more about it!

*Just ordered again and amazed at food quality and serving size! Best in the city"}
{"text":"Amazing place! They called just to thank me for my order, asked me to sing a song by my favorite singer then sent me free roti & cheesecake!!! Blown away!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great - I have ordered the 1/2 fried chicken, rice and peas + broccoli slaw twice.

I would have given 5 stars without hesitation were it not for JUST EAT taking over an hour and a half to deliver the thing. I feel like the restaurant should be aware that they take FOREVER.

Great portion size, and the fried chicken was still quite good despite it being soggy. 
I would recommend asking for a side of some sort of hot sauce as well, as they only gave me ketchup."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time and was very impressed. The food was delicious! We had the jerk chicken and lamb chops and both were moist and cooked perfectly. The delivery time was a bit longer than usual -- but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken delivery, with broccoli coleslaw. Proper winter comfort food delivered!"}
{"text":"Honestly ... I don't know why people are complaining so much. I've ordered Seg'z plenty of times and I get the food within 30 mins. So far everything I've had has been delicious. I love the mix of food they have there and the staff is great."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a solid meal on the cheap.  Super friendly staff with smiles being a constant.  You can order on Just-Eat as well for delivery.  Got the chicken avocado sandwich.  It was tasty.  Would order again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience. That is why they offer free stuff coz they screw up, customer service is above any cheap free drink offer"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from Seg'z and haven't been disappointed. The owner called to ask a trivia question (which I couldn't answer) and offered a complimentary side anyway. I admired the owner's passion and commitment so I was sure the food wood be great. The jerk chicken was perfect and the brisket burger was excellent on my first order. My second order was for fried chicken and rice and it was also very good. I would definitely recommend Seg'z. Excellent food on a budget."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. Im sitting here writing this as I wait for my order that I made 3 FLIPPING HOURS AGO, like, 2 hours before they closed. They're closed now, wont pick up my call/its going to voicemail and my food is still not here. Absolute crap service. Called 4 times and they claimed 1st time: 20min out(this was at 30min late), after 30min: hes 5min away, after 3 hours... I DONT KNOW CAUSE THEY JUST SEND ME TO VOICE MAIL. I'm hangry. This is very poor business."}
{"text":"Seg'z is one of my favourite places to order from. They have an really awesome selection of Carribean food and some Carribean takes on Canadian classics. The food is delicious and the portions are more than filling. My favourite is their burger with jerk chicken- so good!

I've only ever ordered online from this place, and I've never had any troubles with delivery time. It's usually at my apartment within ~40 mins. The staff is helpful and kind; they always call me when they send the delivery man out so I know that my food will arrive soon."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Caribbean that I have had. The jerk chicken was flavourless and no spice what so ever. Diana's jerk sauce is way better than this place. Yah the stuff out of a bottle from metro or longos. Ribs were tough, okay BBQ sauce. Not sure if this place has ever heard of salt.  The veggies had good flavour but over cooked. Rice and peas were cooked very nicely but no flavour.
Placed my order and was told delivery in an hour, no problem there. Called the place 1.5hrs later and was told it should be there soon. Finally shows up 2 hrs after I order. The delivery person told me they didn't have change. She didn't get a tip. Food was like warm at best. 

Do yourself a favour and never order from this place."}
{"text":"Great service, gregarious owner, and good food. Definitely give this a try -- they're in it to win it."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Great food. Awesome atmosphere. But most of all, amazing community environment between the staff that make you feel like they TRULY appreciate your service. I called for delivery and received a call about 10 minutes later, shocked but not TOO shocked (as I have received my food from them within 15 minutes in the past) I answered the phone. A man said he would give us our order for free if we answered all the questions right so my BF and I paused Netflix and immediately went to Google, haha. We didn't get the first question right cuz it was so hard and Google didn't have the answer, hah. He gave us a second chance and we got the question right! But he said he thought we cheated cuz it was a really hard question and we got it right on the first try (we totally cheated) so he said this time we both get anything free off the menu on top of our meal!!!!! SO INCREDIBLE. Literally got both of ourselves an extra meal! I love this place so much! They also called me when they were leaving the restaurant just to let me know. And the food is great. Maybe not the best place in the world but it'll keep me going back for sure, and so many options on JustEat! Thank you Segz!!!!"}
{"text":"Newly re-opened at 503 Oakwood, Seg'z just may be our new go-to bfast spot!  $5.95 bfast special from 11am-11pm: 2 eggs, 3 strips crispy bacon or pulled pork, plantain or homefries (get the plantain!) and toast. $1 coffee.  Will *definitely* go back!"}
{"text":"I had the old school burger and it was the best burger I had ever had and it came with cheese cake and that was the best cheese cake u had ever had. I'm definitely gonna order there again."}
{"text":"Have to say Seg'z is the best.  Friendly staff and an owner that is concerned about what you think.  BRAVO.   Order from here regularly and when my Mom is in town it a definite Jerk chicken order for her and roti for me. mmm mmm mmm"}
{"text":"I loved this place ! Ordered delivery for the first time from here, it's was delicious. We got really generous portions that will definitely last us into tomorrow. Will definitely order from here again!!"}
{"text":"LOVE ME SOME SEGZ! 
I find I am constantly ordering in from Segz. Their prices are totally reasonable and The jerk chicken is super tasty and salads are fresh! Plus, Segz goes far and beyond to please their customers."}
{"text":"Have now ordered delivery from this restaurant 3 times and each time the meals have been fantastic!! Caribbean cuisine bumped up many levels above the average Jerk/Roti place. Have ordered both Chicken and also Jerk Pork Roti, absolutely delicious, added surprise, added plantain inside the Roti just took it to a whole new level. The salmon dishes, either Jerk Salmon or Grilled Salmon, are perfect, with either spinach rice and veggies or peas 'n rice with veggies. Perfectly cooked, reasonable portions and seasoned better than most much more expensive fine dining restaurants. The wings and Jerk ribs combo, out of this world!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 dishes via UberEats. The jerk chicken with rice n peas, and the steak with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables. Don't let their location fool you, this is the worst Caribbean food I've ever eaten.

The jerk chicken came with rice and green peas, and a few slices of plantain on top. The jerk chicken was only seasoned on the outside, and it wasn't very hot. Once I got the inside of the chicken it tasted very bland. I had to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to it just to finish it. The rice was dry and tasted like it had been cooked hours before. I couldn't even finish it. The plantain probably tasted the best out of everything in this dish.

 The steak with garlic mashed potatoes wasn't what we thought it would be either. The steak was cut into strips and kind of stewed with the vegetables, and it hardly even had any steak in it. It was mostly vegetables and wasn't very tasty. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted Ok.

I won't be ordering from this place again. There are so many other Caribbean restaurants in this city with much better tasting food."}
{"text":"I tried Seg'z on the basis of the reviews but wow, bad move.
 My order arrived 1 hour and 10 minutes after I ordered which I am find with if the food is good. It wasn't.  It wasn't even Luke warm. It was as if they took the container from the fridge and put it in the bag and left. 
  The broccoli slaw everyone is raving about for some reason is nothing more than cabbage,  broccoli and carrots chopped and mixed with mayo bereft of any spice, seasoning and flavour. 
 There was no discernable taste difference between the brisket and jerk chicken tacos. How does that happen? 
 The jerk pork dinner with rice and plantain was again, flavorless, bland, boring and mushy, and I wouldn't want to forget cold. 
 Horrible."}
{"text":"Always amazing, I get delivery and it's always hot and delicious. Top notch customer service, and I love getting little gifts! Generous portions and lots of flavour. I  Segz!"}
{"text":"On a lazy weekend night, I was craving Caribbean bbq and decided to order from Seg'z off of JustEat. While they didn't have exactly what I wanted, I still went for it since the reviews were pretty good. I ordered the Macaroni and Jerk Chicken, with a side of fried plantains. Not more than 10 minutes later, I get a call from the \"#1 restaurant in the city\" (lol). I'm assuming it was the owner of Seg'z who called do to the trivia questions (as the other reviews have written about). This is not only a unique and personable touch, but the guy was funny, passionate about the food and restaurant. While he gave me 4 trivia questions (because I flat out told him I didn't know the answers lol) he decided to throw in their famous broccoli slaw. I was extremely happy with the service so far, and couldn't wait to try the food.

15 minutes later, the delivery driver comes and delivers my food. Again, he was very polite and friendly. Even from the bag, the food smelled really good - not sure if it was because I was starving. The portion sizes were generous for the price. The macaroni was mac and cheese (but gourmet-ish?). While I was expecting macaroni salad (with mayo, etc.) the macaroni was still on point. It was hot, creamy, cheesy and delicious. I was expecting the jerk chicken to be a while leg piece with the bone in it, as it's typically served, but instead it was shredded jerk chicken. The macaroni ratio was more than the jerk chicken, regardless, the jerk chicken was very tasty. The plantains were VERYYYYY good. Hit the spot and was exactly what I was looking for. The Broccoli slaw was as good as the other review's described. 

I will be ordering and coming to this place more often. I highly recommend it to anyone who is into Caribbean/Canadian comfort food and likes supporting local businesses! The passion put into the customer service, experience and food is impeccable, rare, and would be a shame to see gone."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Seg'z on Just Eat for the first time. I was very surprised with the quality of food and the chef even threw in a free piece of cake. I will definitely be ordering from this place again!! Don't hesitate to try it."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant to live nearby.  Their brisket is to die for.  Also order their sweet potato mash."}
{"text":"What did I just experience,

Imagine a jerk chicken sandwich, pulled pork on a bun, brisket on a bun and a BLT all in one sandwich. Gluttony at its finest and it shouldn't make sense right?? It was a beauty!!

So many flavors at the same time that my mouth felt like it was dancing to an orchestra of the worlds greatest musicians.  The Meat-atarian is one of the craziest burgers that I have ever had. Spicy, smokey and bbq all mixed in one. 2 thumbs up.

Just to be certain- I wouldn't call this restaurant Caribbean only as that does not justify their menu. I would say is a Fusion of Caribbean with American foods.

My friends ordered the cajun perogies, which were made really well and pan fried to a crisp. They were presented great with garnishes. My other friend ordered the wings. Must say- they looked a little light for wings, but then again they give whole wings  and did not separate the drum and the flats, maybe thats why. He got them HOT- meh...Not that hot at all. Actually this place doesn't make the hottest dishes. So I guess it is what it is.

It is a small place and I believe majority of their business is thru Just Eat or Uber Eats. You can tell as there seemed to be orders coming in like crazy. The owner came by and asked Trivia questions- and I got both answers right- really proud of myself.

Another great find-cant wait to bring more people here. It's one of those gems that your friends will thank you for finding."}
{"text":"Staff: amazing! Delivery is prompt, the phone manner of the person I ordered from was wonderful. The food was a disaster. Poutine was inedible, just didn't taste like anything, though the cheese curds were quite good! The macaroni should have been amazing, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the herbs used were spot on. But they used some sort of oil that made the whole dish taste the way McDonald's kids toys smell. Plastic tasting. The fried chicken was fine, no complaints or compliments. And the perogies were dry and hard. But again, had the makings to be decent."}
{"text":"Truly blessed to have chosen this place on just eat. I got a call from 'the best restaurant in town' while we awaited delivery. I can only assume it was Seg himself. He was out of plantain. He blessed us with some free dessert to compensate. The buns were soggy. Perhaps packing them separate from the juicy meat stuffs, or using a more resilient ciabatta would be a welcome departure. Food was delicious, and the service was just too nice."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here one day. I had only remembered the good Yelp reviews, not the comments about the owner/service.

So I place an order on Just-Eat and get a call maybe 10 minutes later - very little pretense, no trivia questions (thankfully, as I don't know if I could have handled it then), just thanking me for supporting the restaurant and asking me to pick a free thing for my first order there. It was a little difficult being put on the spot, especially because the combo I picked already came with a drink and cake (so I wasn't getting more of those).

In the end, I got the pulled pork macaroni and shrimp quesadilla (the latter of which came with a strawberry-kiwi drink and a nanaimo bar - my choices). The freebie was an order of plantains.

The macaroni was great - not very cheesy but saucy, savory, and tasty. The pulled pork had onions and red peppers and was nicely flavorful. It was an unusual dish - almost like a hot macaroni salad. Kind of garlicky but I liked it. This was the best thing I ordered.

The quesadilla could have had more cheese but was also tasty (and also had onions and red peppers, actually). The side salsa was boring and side sour cream was watery but nobody orders it for that. It was a little difficult to tell what I was tasting when I took a bite - whether it was shrimp, onion, pepper, or whatever - but it was good.

The plantains were unimpeachable and I have zero complaints. Getting them for free was cool. The nanaimo bar was probably not made there, honestly, but it was a nice, serviceable treat. The food I got ended up tiding me over for a good 3-4 meals.

I would love to order from here again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Seg'z is a hidden treasure. The restaurant itself is located in the relatively quiet Oakville and Eglinton West area...not much going on in the area, mostly a lot of small businesses and neighbourhoods. Despite the unassuming appearance, the food at Seg'z is spectacular - the jerk chicken had just the right amount of flavour, the rice and vegetables were very filling and perfectly sautéed and the service was very warm and welcoming. For about $15, I had a very generous helping of 1/4 jerk chicken with rice and peas, some mango Tropik Splash and some really good blueberry cheesecake (not sure if they were homemade or bought fresh from a really food bakery but I suspect that they were homemade). I could barely walk after eating the jerk chicken and rice. My one complaint would be the strong smell of drywall when we first walked into the restaurant - not sure if it is like this all the time but it did take away from our experience here somewhat. Despite the drywall smell, we absolutely enjoyed our food and we are looking forward to trying out more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Why is this place dying??  I've only ordered from just eat so I haven't been to the establishment but based on the food this place is absolutely delicious.  What am I talking about? Their take out containers are littered with stickers bout \"save our restaurant\" and \"we need investors.\" Can someone please give them like hunned gs to get those stickers off ?? Also the food is good. Devastatingly good. I ordered like 3 times in one week... :S 

I've ordered a pulled pork roti which was the finest shredded swine I've ever experienced. The Caribbean spices brought that pig to LIFE--I really feel that they took the standard pulled pork recipe and made it their own. *insert the patented paula abdul slow clap with pinky stickin out* I also had the chicken and pork poutines and they're the bee's knees.  Only they're not as frail and feeble as bee knees.   These rotis are THICK and filling. It's like an ordeal to get through them.

Each time I ordered I got 20% off and a free drink or side. Everyone knows that freebies are key.  Everyone wants to get something for nothing. I also got jerk chicken poutine at one point and it was so big omg. So many. 

Love this place and I had to consciously stop ordering.  This decision was made after that one time they forgot to send a freebie... coincidence? I'll never tell....

5 Starss!!"}
{"text":"So I just mowed 10 lbs of food from this place. My husband and I are two fatsos who ordered quesadillas, 2 jerk chicken dinners, a side of slaw, and a sandwich for tomorrow. Sooo gooood! Amazing portions (we are greek and italian) we can eat, we need alot! But the flavour was so good too! It tasted like completely home cooked like someone's amazing grandma whipped it up! Great value for what you get too. I'm glad we found this place :)"}
{"text":"Couldn't have lazily picked a better spot to eat. Lucky to have this place right across the street...everything is exceptional and professional from the food quality, service, and cleanliness. Wing dinner and a side of sweet potato fries ended up being enough for a small snack thr next day as well. One of the best Caribbean restaurants around. One of the best spots around Toronto period."}
{"text":"Delivery is a little slow but Food I delicious. & Great customer service. :) They also gave me a complimentary broccoli slaw. & the label on the container says Dr Segz is 2 blessed to be stressed. That gave me a little laugh. Lol"}
{"text":"absolutely incredible food.

Ordered tonight on a whim because it's close an pretty inexpensive. I was encouraged by the good reviews but I'm not naive ... delivery food can definitely be hit and miss. This was a huge hit! Extremely fast delivery, and fresh and delicious food. I ordered the jerk chicken roti and, because I had a craving, the pierogies. Both were hot and extremely flavourful - even came with a free container of slaw :) will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Got one star because I couldnt give zero. TASTELESS - you would be turned into jerk in Jamaica for serving this. Tried the jerk Pork combo which had 7 pieces of meat tops. All the rest was filler of rice and veggies and all uniformly tasteless. The peas(?) and rice was w strange colour, had very few peas and the rice tasted starchy. I would say 90% of the meal went of to a well deserved spot - composting. 
Nice phone calls from resto can only go so far unless food delivers on promise
BEWARE restaurants that say Canadian and anything because you know you are going to get tasteless pap."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't know how many times I got their jerk chicken combo delivered through just eat. They almost always come on time. 

Food is stuffed to the max in the container box. Hot and fresh every time! And it tastes heavenly! 

Me and my boyfriend love our delivery so much that we set our goal of the week is to visit the actual restaurant to pay tribute to the sweet sweet owner of the place and everyone else who works for the diner. Haha~"}
{"text":"Delivery was very fast and the food was hot.

But the food was just ok. Not enough spice or flavour in the jerk pork, and the jerk chicken was the same. The broccoli coleslaw was very bland and there was barely any broccoli in it. The pulled pork came in a dilapidated container

The samosas were also quite bland, basically just lentils, and the spring rolls were very basic.

We got a free piece of cake which was great! 

The prices are very good, and at the end of the meal I was satisfied and very full which is the main thing."}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row for dinner! First visit we were greeted by the owner and came to say a few words about how we found out about the restaurant, and then gave us trivia questions. Unfortunately we didn't get most of the answers but still went out of his way to give me a free drink!

The restaurant is quite busy with delivery orders and even the cooks were friendly in providing descriptions of the dishes and making sure it was what we wanted. Even the delivery guy took my dirty plates when we were done eating, seemed like a great team. 

It doesn't seem like much from the outside but the food and presentation was great! 

Tried the grilled chicken sandwich with plantains and both tasted fresh and hot to order. The jerk chicken Roti unfortunately lacked spice and some flavour but the broccoli slaw was sweet and very light. The second night we ordered the jerk chicken burger (yes, jerk chicken on top of a beef burger!) as well as the fried chicken with macaroni. The fried chicken had a great batter and very juicy, but again, lacked some flavour. However, the house made \"Seg'z\" hot sauce was delicious and basically went well with everything!

Would defiantly come back and try the rest of the menu!"}

I'm not a fan."}

{"text":"Ordered off Just Eat. Ordered from their healthy options menu (jerk chicken breast and salmon). Food was delicious. They also gave me bonus plantain because it was the first time I ordered from them. Only complaint is that from time I ordered to time it got to my place was just over an hour and a half which I thought was a bit long (I was hungry). The meal was delicious though. 

I will definitely try dining in next time."}
