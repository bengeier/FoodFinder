{"text":"Very flavorful dinner. I got the Combo with all chicken. The sides: hummus & red salad(beets) were also very good. 
I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Worst kebab ever. I ordered the chicken kabob and it tasted spoiled. I'm middle eastern so I know my kabob and this was the worst \"kabob\" I've ever had. Yuck! No wonder why it was empty in there!"}
{"text":"Really good food!! I had the baklava and it was delicious. Great price and the meat is high quality!!! Cashier is super nice."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Food was great but the delivery took longer than expected. I got the Grand Lula which had chicken, beef, and potato lula.. I had no idea what a lula was but I was feeling adventurous. The potato was SO YUMMY. The chicken was also delicious. I am now a fan of Grand Kebab."}
{"text":"Found this online tonight and decided to try it out. It was awesome! I had the combo plate and they put on their special tomato sauce. Everything was fantastic. Make sure to try the tomato sauce!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after leaving the airport on our way to Hoover Dam. We got combos and the food was really good. The chicken kebabs and the beef lula were our favorites. They had a lot of options for sides and I really liked the pickled veggies and hummus."}
{"text":"Its hard to find good Mediterranean food in this town but we finally found it! 
There was so much food on the plate do come hungry or split it. Either way, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here around two or three weeks ago with my boyfriend, and we both agreed this place offered the best customer service hands down. Free samples of every side, cheery and home-like setting, and not to mention the delicious softness of the chicken kebab and potato lula, this place is a must -- Mediterranean foodie or not!!"}
{"text":"Super cute ! Unexpected! Great food! Friendly staff ! I got the Lulas plate with chicken and beer salad ! I also tried the Mediterranean salad and loved it !"}
{"text":"I'll make it simple. I'm all about logic and evidence when it comes to, well logic and business. and resturant is one of the most sensitive business. Well because food. And food needs to be fresh and that means also ingredients of the food should be kept fresh daily not yearly. Anyways what am I talking about the owner of this restaurant doesn't even probably speak English. This restaurant doesn't carry fresh food of ordered the first time and the food was probably a-year-old no kidding. So if you like some shitty Persian food go ahead and order from this place it's amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and awesome management  !! The food was super delicious!! I've had Mediterranean before but this place blew my mind its a must !!  I am for sure going back to this place to try everything  on the menu ! Every one here and including the staff and management deserve 5 stars and the Food deserves  5 stars. I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Good kebabs and great service. Very friendly. Not many kebab places is the Henderson area so if you're in the mood, try this place. The stuffed bell peppers are pretty good."}
{"text":"I went in last week and it was my first time trying Mediterranean food and I absolutely loved it ! I had the beets salad and it tasted incredible. The cashier was the young lady with long hair she was great, very accommodating and she let us sample different salads. The environment in the store also made me feel very welcome. My experience was great overall, especially the service."}
{"text":"Craving kabobs and found this on Yelp. Fairly new, clean little shop, simple menu. Had combo chicken beef kabobs, good flavor. Especially liked the grilled tomato, so tasty. Plain white rice, pretty good humus. Comes with two sides. Good amount of food for the price. Only wish they had garlic paste for the kabobs."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. The girl working the counter was super friendly, explained the menu and offered samples of anything we wanted to taste. This is not fast food; they actually have lamb chops on the menu. Everything is made to order, the sides are fresh and yummy. The kabobs were perfectly seasoned. We will definitely be back. It appears to be a family run business, which I love."}
{"text":"This is legit homemade delicious Mediterranean food. The employee behind the counter i assume was the owner because he took such care and pride in explaining to food options and flavors to us. Their meats are cooked fresh after you order, but the sides are all prepared and he's willing to give samples! Completely non-judging about the fact that we were unfamiliar with several of the dishes, he just seemed genuinely excited to share and get our feedback. The food and experience was great. A gem hidden in the an unsuspecting strip mall."}
{"text":"Looked for a place to eat close to home after an extra long work day and not feeling up to cooking, decided to give this place a try. They were very friendly and helpful, explaining what the different items were. I got the combo with both beef and my husband got beef with potato. Food was cooked fresh, came out hot and everything was excellent. The hummus was smooth and delish! I recommend giving this place a try. Plan to go back soon to try a couple of other items."}
{"text":"i tried it for the first time and it was really gooooood. this is gonna be my next Mediterrean to go place for sure."}
{"text":"As a European growing up I always had a thing for Mediterranean food and decide to give this place a try after I walked in the woman greeted us and helped us, very patient and nice worker amazing, now let's get to the food we ordered Lula kebabs with 2 sides the food was so fresh so tasty I had to buy 2 more plates to take home, Thank you we will return."}
{"text":"Tonite I decided to stop in and try this new restaurant and I am so glad I did. I walk in and I'm looking at these tv menus and the by the way the food I rciev d actually looked like the food I was served, The staff was very friendly and offered samples to help me decide which side dishes to order. I ordered a kebab and potato lula combo plate and it was awesome! This place has so many choices and everything was delicious and even healthy. I could only eat half my meal( decent portions) so I have leftovers for tomorrow! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee this place! The food is amazing, always fresh and delicious. Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. The only down side is the plastic utensils and plastic plates."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant at least three times a week. The food is fresh and so well seasoned. The service is above and beyond my expectations. The location is well kept and very clean. You cannot go wrong with your selection. The new management and cashier are great. If you have visited this restaurant two months prior you may have experienced hiccups, but not with these new owners. I promise it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"We came by here the other day because we were looking for somewhere to have a quick lunch. The place looks like a basic cafeteria style restaurant, but they grill everything right there. We had the chicken kebobs and they were incredible. The salads were also really good, and the prices very reasonable.
I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Beef and chicken Kebabs excellent taste. I had a Lula special. Excellent customer service.
If you like Kebabs this is the place."}
{"text":"We had the lula, kebabs, fries, salad, lentil soup, yogurt and hummus.  It was all excellent!  Henry was friendly and helped us with our selection.  The baklava was also very good. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe my new favorite place in Las Vegas!! Food was amazing and they even cooked the pork chops just right!! Portions are large enough for two meals! Customer Service was also amazing. If I had to point out a flaw it would be plastic utensils and plastic plate. Not a fan of eating a pork shop trying to cut it with a plastic butter knife!"}
{"text":"I want to take a moment say everybody must try Grand Kebab and barbecue,  it's delicious it's fresh and customer service are excellent."}
{"text":"Got the chicken wrap, the wrap itself tasted great and the sauces it came with really made it taste great. The fries were perfect. The interior was well decorated and the tables were absolutely gorgeous. 
Prices for most things are around $10. 
Would recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here... food is really good and big serving.   The staff are very nice. The ambience is very good and clean. Fod are freshly made. We will come back to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything about this place, especially the food - it was fresh, well cooked, flavorful. We will def come back. We ordered beef/pork kabobs , beef lula, Russian salad, tabouleh, etc. Delicious!"}
{"text":"First time trying Mediterranean food & I loved it. It taste delicious! The flavor are outstanding! My favorite was the potato bomb, it is literally the BOMB! Also the Lulas are amazing! Really nice location, and great vibe. Really recommend this new place!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance. Glad I did. The food is fresh and delicious. Get down here and GRUB!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem. Anyone who enjoys kabobs, gyros, and other Mediterranean food must check it out. Family owned, homemade, and authentic! My boyfriend and I just happen to pass by and we stopped. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on to this restaurant and it was fabulous,  we had the beef and chicken lula,  falafel,  and hummus. Everything was very tasty and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Chop combo meal and was
More then pleased. No only is the food delicious to the tip but the workers and the vibe of the place really help it come together. Definitely would  recommend this restaurant to my family and friends."}
{"text":"This is very good and fresh food I got the lulas! And the red beer salad so good. I will be coming back for the fresh food and good service"}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from Grand Kebab for about 2 weeks now. They have really quality food for a fair price and has pretty decent portions. The man with a unique accent has delivered to me twice and has excellent customer service. He even was kind enough to provide extra rice and inform me whenever there are any delays. 

Although Grand Kebab has all these great qualities, it's just one bad service that makes this 3 stars. I ordered delivery for lunch once again and it was a different delivery person. Not only was she 10 minutes late, she didn't bother to inform me ahead of time and gave me an attitude and stated \"Maybe you should put the Suite number down I've been driving back and fourth.\" And I literally saw her in front of my door. Maybe she should look first before she fetches an attitude. 

Otherwise, great job to the one man with the unique accent. Give him a raise lol!"}
{"text":"We dropped by for dinner on a rainy Sunday night. It wasn't busy, but that's because it was a new place. I expect, with a little luck and maybe some polish, that they'll get busier.

The decor is nice and comfortable. The service is friendly. Their menus are easy to understand with clear photographs so you know what you are ordering.

We ordered a couple of plates with beef kebab, pork kebab, chicken lula, hummus, tabbouleh and Mediterranean salad. It took a few minutes for the food to get to us, but it was worth the wait. The food is well-prepared and tasty.

You'll probably enjoy a comfortable tasty meal if you decide to give this place a try. We'll probably be back to try out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fresh food, and very flavorful!! They have a Russian potato salad and that was my favorite side. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Really good food. If you have a big appetite they're dish are more than enough to fill you right up for price.I've been to other Greek spots but this is going to be one of my top three. People should really give them a try. Hopefully this gives them more foot traffic as it was my wife and I with the kids."}
{"text":"Ive driven by this place a few times, and I knew I had to try them. Food was great, especially the yogurt and cucumber dip and hummus. Just like mom makes. I plan to have them cater my birthday dinner! Authentic, great price, and super nice."}
{"text":"What a surprising find in a shopping plaza! My friend lives in the area and wanted to bring me here for dinner.  I was excited because I love hidden gems.  Food was very fresh, I ordered the potato lula and wish I could have tried the vegetable kebab. They were unable to change the combo to have a vegetable kebab, only a meat version, so I stuck with two potato lulas.  I absolutely loved their beet salad as a side order. The thin lavash style bread was also soft and perfect for scooping up the food with.  Other lavash breads I have had in the past were not as good, hardened after getting cold.    Portions are generous and I ate mine in two meals. They also gave free bottled water. Only downside was it took forever to get the food, although I don't mind waiting when it means I am getting freshly cooked quality food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kebab plate and I thought it was delicious. I also ordered the hummus and cucumber yogurt. The hummus and cucumber yogurt had great flavor and I was impressed.  Cucumber had a lot of dill.  LThe garlic sauce was so garlicky that it had a little spice.  Very garlicky but good. The only complaint I had was I didn't like the rice.  It was hard and I don't think it was cooked right.  Either way I thought the food was so good I didn't want to knock them a star because I thought it was that good. I would recommend this place and I would come back.  FYI I'm from Glendale California and If you have been there you know why my opinion really counts."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the best I have ever tried. The meats flavor and everything in general was delicious. Grand Kebab was way better than any other kabab place. It is a very nice and unique place."}
{"text":"I was craving Beef kebab and found this place, great food, great service, very clean and Chris checked up on me plenty of times to make sure I was ok as I ate in the restaurant.  Highly recommend this place if you are in the Henderson area.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow- this is an all-around great place! I had the steak kabobs with hummus and baba ghanoush. The steak was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and so so juicy, and the sides were to die for! In addition to that the owner is seriously nice and really takes pride in the food he serves. He came out to talk to everyone that was there to ensure that the food was good and all were satisfied. I will definitely be back to try more things, and soon!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped here for dinner last night. We were looking for some low carb options and Grand Kebab got good Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. This appears to be a local family business, which I always prefer patronizing over big chains. The staff very friendly and accommodating, despite us arriving about 30 minutes before closing. The restaurant is spotless clean and nicely decorated. 

The food... simply excellent. The wife had a chicken kebab that was incredible - packed with flavor and very moist meat.  I had the beef kebab that was the same. The salad was good with fresh, crisp lettuce, feta cheese, and a tasty dressing.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best eateries in Vegas area very clean awesome service there chicken shish kebabs with fries are my favorite thing on this planet absolute hidden gem"}
{"text":"Wonderfully authentic! My boyfriend and I found this place through a quick search on Yelp and the four and five stars reviews don't lie. 

Just a note, my BF is vegan and usually has to settle for the saddest of options at any place other than a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant but that is not the case at Grand Kebab. They offer not only a grilled veggie plate but you could easily make your own mezze plate out of the side dishes. I saw baba ganoush, tabbouleh, hummus, two different green salads, and rice. The owner told me that he offers different sides each day. 

The BF ultimately went with the grilled vegetable plate and was very satisfied with the size, the price, and the taste. The vegetable skewer was nicely seasoned with flavored oil and consisted of red bell peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, yellow squash, onions, and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were a nice touch and rarely seen on a vegetable skewer. The veggies were plated over seasoned rice with a huge side of hummus and a large piece of pita. 

I went with a combo of beef lula and chicken kebab with hummus and tabbouleh. The combo also came with the seasoned rice and the bread. The lula was so, so flavorful and and juicy. So good! The chicken was cooked perfectly with a mild spice. The hummus is some of the best I've ever had and blows all of that grainy supermarket hummus out of the water. I love tabbouleh and this was amazing with a bright lemony kick and good ratio of bulgur to parsley and mint.

The size was enough to leave leftovers and not just a couple of bites. I still had half left for a great breakfast the next day. 

Please do not be in a hurry when you come here. The side dishes are prepared but the meats and veggies are made to order. The kitchen has a window so you can see the owners making your food. No pulling pre-made foods from the refrigerator and microwaving them here. The owner told me that they don't even have a microwave. And you can look in the kitchen and see that!

We will be back. I still have lamb chops and cornish game hen to try, as well as the sides I couldn't get to like the salads and the cacik (tzatziki). 

If you have a picky/non-adventurous eater, you will be happy to know that they do offer fried chicken fingers. But really, if you want to stick with chicken, go with the kebab. It is a hand-cut and marinaded chicken breast. So tasty and won't freak out your non-adventurous eater. 

Oh, and ask the owner to play you some of his favorite music while you are there. You might find a new favorite jazz artist!"}
{"text":"The kebab was ok. (On the bland side). Nothing to write home about. I also ordered a baklava. It was so pathetic, hardly had any nuts in it. As someone who loved in the Middle East, this place might wow Americans, but it is nowhere close to authentic food."}
{"text":"It isn't easy to find kebabs that are cut generously and cooked (not over cooked) correctly.  With a nice variety of sides, pleasant service and clean appearance.  I will return to try the lula.

look up their location before you set out, because it's in a strip mall set back from the street, flanked by Ross for Less and Hobby Lobby."}
{"text":"Great place to stop at. Very clean. Very friendly. But when you make an food order. It should not take 30 minutes to make a meal. Plus you guys need to go easy on salt. A little too much on the meats. But other than that it's okay."}
{"text":"My mom and I have been here twice now and the food has been delicious both times.  
First, the restaurant is very clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.   We've never really had Mediterranean food before, so it was very nice for the gentleman to explain the dishes to us.  
The food was very fresh and made to order, so expect to wait a few minutes but well worth it."}
{"text":"We were really pleased with the friendliness of the staff and flavor of the food but disappointed in the value for the money. The sides were amply portioned, but the meat was only a few bites per meal. I feel bad complaining since it was really slow when we were there and is a small operation, so I'm sure they have to stretch their dollars, but I just can't go back if I'm not getting a full meal for the price."}
{"text":"My first time here, and it was an awesome experience. The food was delicious (big portions and choice of two sides). I ordered the lulas beef plate with Mediterranean salad. The owner came out to make sure everything was good. I love kebobs, and Grand Kebab is up there. And did I mention reasonably priced. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, flavorful and juicy food, good service. The employees are very friendly and caring trying hard to provide best customer service. Its brand new they just opened."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. The portions are apt. The meat had great flavour. Appreciate the quick service for pick up orders."}
{"text":"Been here twice, had the beef kabob the first time and the lamb chops the second time, both were overcooked."}
{"text":"Veggie kebabs very fine at best - hummus was not great - rice was good - people were very friendly though!"}
{"text":"First time I stepped into this place found out that it jst opened. Looks nice inside and very clean . Friendly staff, food tastes very good and juicy. I wish good luck to them seems like it's going to be a hit!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here. Cozy place. Great mediterenean menu with fare prices. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just happen to come across this place. The food is great. The serving sizes were more than enough, we had to take home and had remaining for dinner. I couldn't waste it, it was so delicious. Will definitely be back when coming to this side of town. Great food with great prices. The staff was very pleasant and very helpful since we had never been here before. Thanks for the wonderful food and good luck in future business."}
{"text":"How do I start! The combination of rice and salad had enough portion of each and was great. The chicken kebab was juicy and delicious. The place is cosy and feels like home, and they are very welcoming."}
{"text":"Baffling how this place got such good reviews. (They must have a lot of friends.) Good food, fresh, but only a notch above what you could get in the grocery store. Very, very long wait time. I was the only person here and the food took 17 minutes. Very, very expensive. And, they don't serve water--you need to buy water. A bottle of water costs $1.89. Finally, no followup asking me if I needed anything."}
{"text":"If you're looking for juicy, uber fresh, and delicious kebabs; this is the place. They grill each order individually on a skewer, which takes time to get just right, but they take care with how their meat turns out. I ordered chicken and chicken is usually on the drier side at most kebab spots but this one was so juicy. The owners are gracious and are attentive to you and your enjoyment of the meal. It said a lot about the care they take with their food. I recommend the chicken wrap and the Cornish Hen, which were the two plates we ordered. Next time I'm in the area I'm going to try the beef options. Definitely give it try!"}
{"text":"Met my wife here for lunch and that was good choice.  I ordered the pork chop and I was afraid it would be dry.  I was wrong!! It was incredibly juicy and tender.  My only gripe was they had no ice.  What restaurant has no ice machine?

Otherwise it will be our go to Middle Eastern spot."}
{"text":"Place was clean and the food was good for the price. You get a lot for your money.  The TV was not working which was ok but the NBA finals were on.   
The beef lula was good. The hummus and tabbouleh was good too!  
Good place to get to go."}
{"text":"This place has changed owner and the menu/price is not accurate. This needs to be updated on yelp. I asked for a chicken lula and beef kabob and they took 3 minutes to consult each their about it and then told me they couldn't do it because it's not on the board. Ok...but you serve those items yet you can't give me that combo? Also sides are now not part of the meal, they are extra $4-6 each. The service is very slow as well. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Really love this place. My boyfriend was in the mood for Mediterranean food and he ended up finding this place, first time we tried it...it was delicious and very good. Today I was craving it quite badly and I called to place an order which was super convenient for me because I'm extremely exhausted from work. 20 mins after i go in and get my order, super friendly staff greated me and was very helpful. I ordered 2 grand lulu's, they allowed me to change my sides....the hummus is the best. Great staff and great food, definitely love coming here."}
{"text":"This place is truly just so good, the meat the vegetables, everything is very fresh. I got the Kebab and Lula combo and wraps are delicious. So glad they opened this place in the Stephanie area!"}
{"text":"First timer. Came here with my girlfriend. She got the chicken kebab. It comes with two sides and rice. I got the lula. Loved them both. We also both tried their grape leaves, and they were awesome. Usually places make them too salty because they are out of a can. You can tell theirs is hand made. I'm glad I found a local kebab place!"}
{"text":"Not authentic food. Rice was dry and no taste, the salad was basic, not Mediterranean the chicken was slimy tasting. Will never ever return."}
{"text":"I tried flame kabob last week and was not that impressed so I continued my hunt for a good kebab spot. I found this quiet little place nestled in the corner of the target shopping plaza and decided to try it out. 

I got the combo plate which came with the Beef Lula and Beef Kebab. The price was definitely a few dollars cheaper than flame kabob and the portion size is pretty similar. The meat was definitely more tender than flame kabob and had more flavor. The upside to this spot is that you get to choose 2 sides and there is quite a bit to choose from. 

When comparing the prices between Grand Kebab vs Flame Kabob, you get way more for your money at Grand Kebab. I will continue looking around for kebab joints, but this may be the winner for the time being."}
{"text":"We find it very difficult to find GOOD Mediterranean spots here in Vegas. Luckily we found a great one here! The food is absolutely delicious and so fresh!!! Definitely worth what you're spending. The service was very good as well. Super nice staff!!! We are eager to come back as well as tell our friends and family. Delicious food honestly."}
{"text":"Just found this spot on Yelp. Food was freshly prepared and delicious. I couldn't stop eating!! The owners are very friendly. Really nice vibe in the restaurant too. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food is tasty and fresh. The owner cares about customer satisfaction"}
{"text":"Ordered food around 8:00 now it's 9:56pm, yet still nothing. We personally had to call they didn't even bother contacting us to let us know if there was a problem. When I did call the lady said they can give you a discount without even apologizing. Im sure the food here was great but looks like we aren't going to be ones who try it. I wouldn't try this again in the future. Don't order for delivery if you do decide to eat from this location, or just make sure you're not hungry at the moment because you will be waiting."}
{"text":"Was looking for an alternative because me and my boyfriend were tired of fast food. We walked in and was greeted right away. He let us sample because we were not sure what to get. He recommended the combo so we could share and have a variety. I ordered chicken kebab and chicken lulu with hummus and mediterranean salad and fries. My boyfriend ordered beef kebab and pork lulu with Russian salad and potato salad with fries. We also ordered an order of cucumber yogurt. The man in the front also gave us an order of baba ganoush. Overall, great service and great food. Even have options for kids and delivery. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My daughter found this place by Apple Maps ... a surprise hit!  Awesome humus, great chicken wrap (), and super friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Really great and flavorful kabobs. I had the beef kabob so I can only speak on that. It blended well with the rice (you can either do fries or rice). Meat was tender and juicy. Mediterranean salad was superb as well bursting with just the right amount of flavors. 

One star off just because I felt like it was a little overpriced for what it was. Wish they had more of a selection on their menu. If you come here on your lunch break, I'd pass because it takes a really long time to cook. So on the downside, it sucks because it does take forever to get your food here, but on the plus side it's all made fresh to order.

Would come back here again!"}
{"text":"The first thing I should've noticed went there for lunch nobody was in there on a Monday. I got the chicken and the beef kebab. The beef taste like it was just microwave tough as leather and the chicken was preformed chicken that was just grilled. The food was totally gross a waste of money. I can't believe that this place ever had good reviews. Yelp you just got me again."}
{"text":"Great service! The food does take a little waiting, but just remember that means it's being cooked up Freah! And it's well worth the wait. I even tried ordering their delivery and it's just as good at home. Haha. Meat was super tender and well seasoned. Their portions are huge so I shared mine with my husband. Their lentil soup is amazing! My husband favorite is the steak kabobs but mine are by far the chicken Lulas!!!! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in town. I never feel too heavy after eating here and all of the food is fresh, tastes super clean, and uses good quality meats. The prices are great and so is the service. The owner makes sure that you are happy with your food and experience. Just wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food from a friendly owner who makes you feel at home and says, \"You know what makes our restaurant different from the others? ...Everything!\"  They make their own unique marination for their meats.  Excellent food.  Top notch service.  Definitely worth checking out if you love Kebab."}
{"text":"New place and delicious chicken Lula plate! I jut moved to Henderson and owner is so kind! Checked on us and how our food was, super great I love Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good sized portions. Food takes a while since the meat isn't precooked, but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Lula, hummus, tabouleh, rice, and stuffed peppers are great. The kababs need some work. Beef was tough, chicken was very dry. 

Delivery was on time and food was hot. Next time I want to order in Greek this is a very acceptable offering."}
{"text":"The food at this place is awesome and the service is phenomenal. Everything is homemade and delicious great prices as well"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Excellent food and people. Ordered the beef kabob and it was great. Nice that you get 2 sides on top of rice that already comes with it. Lots of choices to pick from. Cooked to order. Very fresh. Thanks  again!!"}
{"text":"I had the potato bomb, ground meat surrounded by mashed potatoes then deep fried. It came with a red cabbage salad and a fresh cucumber salad. This was my first time having a potato bomb, be careful it's hot, it was still hot 10 minutes after I picked up my food. It tasted good, with the appropriate amount of spices and it was really big. There was a sauce that came with it, I believe it was tomato based, it helped with the dryness of the mashed potatoes. 

They give you a lot of food for $15. I found the red cabbage salad interesting, I believe it had walnuts in it. My only dislike is that everything had a one note taste, it was good but did get a bit boring over time. I think this is easily alleviated by sharing your food or using different components for future meals. 

Give the place a try. I always try to support local businesses when I can. I'm going to try the kebabs next time."}
{"text":"Amazing. Huge portions, wonderfully tender cooked Lula and Kabob meats of your choice. The combos are a great deal and the popular choice. Comes with 2 sides of your choosing and you can't go wrong with their tabouli and beets.

Armin behind the counter was incredibly kind and helpful. She enjoyed explaining the different options and offering her favorite dishes. 

A little bit of a wait for the food but it was piping fresh and there was so much of it! Worth the price. Would definitely recommend and will be coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"Undercooked chicken and super slow service. I will not be going back. Moreover, the chicken and rice had ZERO flavor. 60% of the $12 plate was bland rice."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hole in the wall kind of place that serves delicious food. Very affordable. We ordered the Grand Lula plate which exceeded my expectations in taste and food quality. Extremely tasty and flavorful.
The service was fantastic very friendly staff.  It's a family owned business and you can really feel the love and care put into the restaurant and food. 
If you want the BEST Mediterranean food in town COME HERE!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and how great the food and people are. 
Growing up in a Persian household good Middle Eastern food is always hard for me to find while eating out. Here at Grand Kebab I feel like my dad and uncles have cooked delicious rice and kabob just for me. The beef and chicken lulas and kabob are seasoned perfectly. It is served with a generous portion of rice with 2 additional sides. 
I highly recommend this place if your craving some authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, we for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here. Ordered the steak kebab and chicken lula combo. Tabbouleh and hummus as side. And an order of backlava. 

Food was acceptable. Wasn't anything outstanding or make me keep coming back for me. The pricing for the backlava seemed a little high for its price. The steak kebab was a little tough. The chicken lula was a lot better. Tabbouleh was really good and flavorful. Hummus was standard, nothing that was impressive. I might give this place another shot in the future, maybe dine in if I'm ever in the area to. Not a bad place but not the best."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service at a great price. I was in town visiting my mom and pulled this place up on Yelp and decided to drop in. I highly recommend the potato salad. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, everything was so delicious. The lula kabob was to die for and the chicken Kabob was so so good. Definitely will come back ...."}
{"text":"Great food! Very fresh, like a home cooked meal. I've been to all the Mediterranean restaurants in the area and this is the best."}
{"text":"Best Kebab Ever Tried In Vegas ,Very Clean ,Delicious  Food & good service ,this is family restouran and everything  is like Homemade Food."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Grand Kabab through Eat 24 yesterday for lunch. I would have just gone out rather than getting delivery were it not for my crazy headache and the neighbors who completely blocked my drive-way. But that is another story. In regards to Grand Kabab, I probably would not have chosen it had I gone out. I am mostly happy that I found them and ordered from them. But I have to say, it took a long time to get my order. When I ordered, Eat 24 was telling me it would take 45-60 minutes. It also told me a confirmed delivery time of 2:30 (which would have been 45 minutes). My food finally arrived around 3:00 after about an hour and 10 mintutes. By this time I was down right starving since it had turned into a late lunch. All I could think was \"this better be good.\"

And it was good. I'd say it was dofferent than I was expecting but having never been to Grand Kabab prior I didn't really kniw what to expect. I ordered a Grand Lula plate sticking with my philosophy of trying everything if you don't know what to try. This comes with beef kabab, chicken kabab, potato lula and three sides. For my sides I ordered salma, stuffed pepper and rice. The plate also had flat bread, a roasted hot pepper and a boiled tomato.

The kababs (beef and chicken) were very lightly seasoned but not at all bland. A little salt. A little spice. Ground and very densly packed, these meat sticks held up well rolled up in the flat bread. Not a bad start. The potato lula was interesting. It reminded me of a twice baked potato without the skin. It was whipped potatoes extruded into a shape similar to the kababs. Pretty cool. I had never had anything quite like that before.

My first side, salma, is stuffed grape leaves which I know better as dolmas. Two pieces and tender leaves stuffed with rice. Standard but a very nice treat that I enjoy very much. My second side, stuffed pepper, was a surprise. I am used to a meat stuff pepper served hot. This was more of a salad. A pickled slaw of cabbage, celery and garlic stuffed into a red bell pepper. It was good but wholly unexpected. The rice was simply rice and not worth discussing further. Same with the tomato thrown in there. And the hot pepper which was too hot for me to get past one bite.

The food I had from Grand Kebab was good. Very tasty. More expensive than I think it should be though. And delivery took too long. But the driver was friendly and apologetic for the delay. Not fully a 4-star experience but a solid 3.5-3.75 for sure. Maybe dine-in would sway my opinon more in their favor."}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck! These reviews must be from friends because I got the chicken and beef kabob beef was sooo over cooked! Chicken looks like rib meat not even real chicken. Rice wasn't even cooked all the way and they don't even give you real pita bread it's like a tortilla. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and the food oh so fresh! I haven't had much experience eating Mediterranean food, but this was the best I've had. Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time and it was lovely. The gentleman behind the counter was so friendly and super helpful with explaining the different plates, gave me a sample of tabbouleh and recommending something which I then ended up ordering (#2 - Beef Kebab & Lula combo). It was delicious and they definitely serve big portions so be sure to come with an appetite! 

Cute little spot, good food and friendly service. Definitely will be going back again"}
{"text":"Savory food. Reasonable prices. Very clean. What more do you need? I'll be back. Under new ownership so the menu is slightly different from what's posted."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to try this place for lunch after seeing the reviews it got. I ordered the chicken kebabs w/ rice, salma (grape leaves), and hummus. My chicken was moist, but did lack some flavor. However, the side of tomato sauce they gave us to dip the meat in made it a lot better. The rice was okay, the grape leaves were yummy, and the hummus was delicious. My bf had the chicken lulas w/ rice, grand salad, and pickled veggies. The chicken lulas were are a lot more flavorful than the kebabs, I loved the pickled veggies (my bf wasn't a fan), and he said their grand salad with chopped apples was delicious. They are fairly new and didn't have fountain drinks and a very small selection of bottled beverages. Their to-go containers are pretty awesome, the lids stay on and their microwave safe."}
{"text":"Oh wow, so many good things to say about Grand Kebab! The moment we walked in, Armen greeted us with such a friendly presence and introduced us to the full menu and all the options. We tried kebabs, which we were familiar with and lula, which was new to us (as well as a host of sides). The food is cooked fresh in front of your eyes through a large window into the kitchen, and the results are fantastic! My favorite was the pork kebab, which had amazing flavor, but I seriously could not stop coming back for more hummus, rice, and potato lula. The amount of food is perfect for the price, but Armen's excellent service probably stood out the most. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My mom found this place on yelp, I was a bit hesitant because there were not a lot of reviews (I guess they are new) but they definitely exceeded my expectations. The food was cooked to order and everything is made homemade. We had two plates with chicken kabobs one with rice other with fries and we enjoyed all of it, and we are very picky! Employees were very nice and helpful with menu questions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late afternoon lunch after hiking and really love everything about this place. 

Our first impression of the restaurant was how clean and orderly the restaurant was inside. I loved the electronic menu board that was easy to read and clearly showed the different menu options. The woman at the register greeted us as we arrived and was patient as we decided between all of the options. 

My husband and I both ordered the Kebab & Lula Combination Plate. The plate comes with rice or fries, two sides, pita bread, and a drink. I opted for the Beef Kebab and a Chicken Lula with cucumber sauce and stuffed pepper as my sides. I loved everything about my meal. The beef had a great flavor and I loved the chicken as well. The chicken lula flavor reminded me of rotisserie chicken. The cucumber sauce was yummy and great for dipping the meat and pita. The stuffed pepper was different than I expected, but really good and was stuffed with what tasted like pickled vegetables. I really enjoyed the other goodies on the plate including the rice, sliced onions, and roasted tomato. Every item I tried was very fresh. My husband raved about his meal as well. Meal portions were large and a great value. 

Overall, Grand Kebab is a great place to get a fresh meal. The reasonable pricing, clean restaurant, and friendly staff are just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I just had the Lula beef wrap with french fries and I loved it. The meat was full of flavor and the fries were not your usual, they must have been homemade. I cannot wait to visit this place again. I am so happy I randomly stumbled upon it. A+++ grade from me and my belly."}
{"text":"We stopped by today to try this place out. We were amazed by the quality and flavor of the food. Chris gave us wonderful suggestions on what to try. We had pork chops, kebab and Lula. Food was cooked right and any plate comes with a good size sides . We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here.  Owners were really nice. We ordered the beef kebab with stuff peppers and hummus. The beef was tasty and juicy. Love the hummus. The stuff peppers were a bit overwhelming for my taste.  Definitely not disappointed with grand kebab."}
{"text":"This is easily the best place to get kebabs. Everything is being cooked wile you can watch him from a glass wall. Everything is very fresh and tastes amazing. The staff is very friendly so if you want to taste a salad before you purchase it they will kindly give a sample.  There new so not many people know of it so if you come and you see how right I am you should spread the word."}
{"text":"Very Clean. Great service, extremely good food.  Healthy alternative. Great for people eating Keto!"}
{"text":"We have tried several kabob places in Las Vegas but the ground beef is usually too greasy or filled with bread crumbs. This place has the best ground beef kabob besides homemade. Cornish game hen and Chicken breast were also very juicy and seasoned well."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken wrap and  soooooo disappointed! It doesn't even look like chicken and it has a weird rubbery texture."}
{"text":"Great food it was delicious and friendly I ordered on yelp 10 minutes before it said it closed and got there right at closing time I didn't notice yelp pushed my order to opening next day but he made it for me and I gladly waited he really was supposed to turn me away and I appreciate it this was my second visit but I'm sure I'll be a regular and recommend it just for the taste"}
{"text":"Very nice homemade Mediterranean food. The menu is uncomplicated and the selection is just right. The owners were very kind and provided excellent service. I enjoyed the chicken more than the beef but the flavors were very good. I loved the cucumber salad and could eat a bowl of just that."}
{"text":"The food at Grand Kebab is delicious! I had the beef lula and chicken kebab...the chicken was SO tender and juicy. The sides were amazingly fresh and satisfying. The price for the portion of food they give you is definitely reasonable! Easily 5 stars, for sure!"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite place, the lady there was super friendly and helpful with items we weren't familiar with let us try new stuff. The place was very clean and very nice looking. The food was amazing, the chicken was not dry at all and the beef was tender. The best tabbouleh in the valley, the only thing is I am used to having cucumber in it but still great stuff. Their potato salada is the best, so good we got a large side to go just to have some at home later. Definitly our go to place now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after hearing good reviews from my mom. This place is awesome! Service is great and the restaurant is super clean.
One of the best parts is the food is made to order with fresh generous portioned sides. We ordered the combo kabob and lula. The beef and the chicken are both delicious as is the tabouleh and the Mediterranean salad. We got a side of hummus and lavash / the bread with our meal and the plate and sides were enough to feed two people with food leftover. 
Definitely somewhere we'd be ordering from / visiting again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good kebab, this is the place to be. Their prices for plates combos are unbeatable...starting at $9.99. I ordered the Lulas combo for $9.99 and I chose 2 Lulas, rice with 2 sides tabuleh & hummus. I was leaving Hobby Lobby when this caught my eye so I decided to check it out. I'm glad I did because the food here was great and the seasoning isn't overpowering like other kebab places I've been to. The owners are very pleasant and friendly. The establishment is very clean. Come check out this place!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty, but lost stars from my review because I did not receive what I had ordered online. Disappointing. Will try again"}
{"text":"This is the best kebabs I have ever tried they are very juicy fresh and freshly done,give them a try you won't be disappointed,the portions are really big and you will be full by the time your done everything taste fresh and healthy style with fresh veggies if you like organics this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stumbled across this place tonight and gave it a shot. I must say the food is excellent and and can only be out done by the super friendly service. The dining was clean and decor very comfortable."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Offered recommendations and samples right off the bat, and everything was sooooo good I had a hard time deciding what to order. I had a great first experience, and will absolutely be back. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Great kebab, best beef Lula in town, super juicy and not overcooked. Great sides, if we lived on that side of town this would be one of our regulars. 

Only thing I would change is to have more pita/wrap with our meals.

It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after reading all the reviews I order 2 plates one chicken kebab/beef lula and one beef kebab/chicken Lula as soon as I saw it I knew it was not going to me good the chicken was over cooked with no flavor and the beef just same nothing Special the rice is a short grain balsamic but the lowest quality, to all of you who this place a a 5 star I highly recommend you to go try fresh kebab."}
{"text":"Today my sister and I wanted to grab a bite but we ended up w a mouthful...of deliciousness. Grand Kabob is grand indeed, in taste and customer service. I had the lamb chops dish and she the pork chops. She's a picky and usually goes for the safest thing at every restaurant, chicken fingers. I, on the other hand, will try anything once but my palate is high maintenance for flavor. The fact that this place was able to satisfy both of our taste needs is pretty cool. Chops were pretty thick, juicy n well seasoned. They had a bit of a bite due to the pepper but it wasn't overwhelming. The pickled cabbage was one of our favorite choices. The hummus was very yummy and the young man we spoke to said that along with everything else is freshly made. The lamb was so good I probably won't ever try anything else. I felt full but not stuffed and that's a good thing. The only thing was the bread it was too much and not much flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered Beef Kebab and Grand Lula Combo, definitely will become a go to place. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The side items all done right. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with family here today. You have to try the pork chops. It has great seasoning and cooked just right. Enough to share for sure. The kabobs and lulas are very tasty. The family that owns and runs the place are the nicest people. Small hidden gem place where everything is made to order and done well."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and the food was delicious and the service was great. Very nice people, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! We were contemplating a new place to try and found Grand Kebab. This place exceeded our expectations in flavor and portion size. The baklava was AMAZING!! Great kebobs and TONS of food! We will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here one night looking to try something new. The customer service was absolutely lovely, and the food definitely lived up to the expectations set by previous reviewers. I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"After my friends telling me hundreds of times I finally decided to go try this place out and honestly I regret not coming earlier the place is very clean and their food is AMAZING their beef shish kebab and their beef luleh is one of the best I've ever had will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Reasonable price and delicious food. Their chicken kebabs are so tender and juicy that I have no qualms about saying \"tender and juicy\" with a straight face. I can easily eat one combo plate for 2-3 meals. For my two sides, I'll always get the tabbouleh for one side and I'm going to start switching off between the potato salad and selmas for my other side. I love the roasted vegetables and bread that come with the combo too. I really like that they open relatively early so I can pick it up for a nice, fresh brunch after a morning workout. The staff are very nice, the place is clean (although I usually just order pick-up off Yelp), and they had Parks and Rec playing last time I went."}
{"text":"Was looking for Mediterranean food around this area & came across this restaurant. It was pretty empty when we walked in. Menu was easy to chose from & the side dishes are displayed right in front so you can easily see them. The food took a little while to come out. The food was fresh.  Did not really enjoy the rice flavor. The meat & chicken had good flavor. Overall it was a decent meal but probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Whenever I am over in Green Valley, I am always perusing my bookmarks to see where I can try out a new or unfamiliar place. Yesterday's choice was the Grand Kebab. 

Pretty easy to find right off of Stephanie in the Target shopping center. It is two doors down from Ross. 
Mom wasn't too hungry so she had a bowl of Lentil soup which she liked very much. The menu is pretty diverse and offers a lot of choices in terms of entrees and sides. Entrees are various kebabs, lulas, wraps or a combo. All the food is made fresh while you wait and you create the dish you want. I ordered the chicken lula which came with two chicken skewers, rice, salad, hummus and their yummy pita bread. This meal was very tasty, the chicken juicy and the hummus is some of the best. They offered me a sample of the beet/nut salad along with small cup of cucumber yogurt! The beet salad was earthy tasting and I think I could get used to eating it. The yogurt was rich and creamy. The drink choice is limited to Coke or water. They just opened so hopefully they will install a machine with more drink options. They are amongst a plaza of which there are many food choices. Hoping they are successful and when in this area, I shall return just because the food is fresh and not processed."}
{"text":"Tried it, not impressed. Husband asked for a bit of olive oil for hummus. They claim they don't have any. What Mediterranean restaurant does not have olive oil? The pita bread, not sure if it's pita (might have a different name) looks more like a Mexican tortilla than pita bread. I don't think we will be back. There's better options in the area."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch every other day. Great fresh food! I normally don't eat Mediterranean food but I've been missing out! Try their pork chops! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Well seasoned cuts of meat, delicious rice and overall a very healthy alternative, make this place a must visit."}
{"text":"Great experience.  The food, which we had a variety of, was delicious. Everything is homemade. The service was very friendly. Everything is cooked to order, so it takes a bit longer to receive your order. The servings are very generous."}
