{"text":"This is a great little place for lunch and a nice addition to the Davidson community.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We just finished a great dinner here! My husband actually brought his dad here early this morning for breakfast and the egg and bacon sandwich on toast was enough for him and his dad and  they even took a portion to his mom. He said it was great food and service! For dinner we had the spinach salad (they divided it for us, yay!) and the appetizer portion of the fried calamari and shrimp and it was awesome! Had a wonderful local beer, too. Service was spectacular. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for lunch after the farm market.
Great sandwiches made with good fresh products. The only negative point is that we have had to wait more than 30mn to get our order ready. They need additional staff in the kitchen the get my 5th star. Nice staff in the room. Waitress apologized several time for the slow preparation of our order.
After lunch we have had a nice walk meandering in the nice shops on main street and in the College Campus."}
{"text":"I had the Italian herb chicken sandwich and it was great. The coconut cream cake was good too. It was lighter than normal but still delicious.  The only reason for 4 stars is because of the pricing. For two sandwiches and a tomato mozzarella salad it was just over $40."}
{"text":"They have great breakfast sandwiches - especially on their homemade biscuits. They are served with a fresh side salad and a piece of fruit, and it is awesome, but a tad pricey (I think). 

I was not a big of a fan of their dinner service, because the prices are too high to justify the tiny portions that don't blow me away. I don't think just putting white tablecloths out justifies the high cost for dinner, but I'll keep coming back for coffee and breakfast. 

Oh, and the atmosphere is really quaint, too!"}
{"text":"A nice dining experience. 
Appetizers: get the cheese and meats which will compliment the great choice of wines offered
Dinner: Had the pasta and meatballs. If I said spaghetti you would think it had more sauce. I learned from Sara (owner) that too much sauce kills the taste and she was exactly right. The meatballs were the star though. great blend of beef, pork and some very good spices....some of the best I've had.
The background music which was not too loud but just loud enough to hear: Coldplay...thank you
The lighting: excellent...not too light but not so dark that you can't see anything.
Thank you Sara. You provide the perfect balance of attention, product information and conversation
Looking forward to trying more wine and the cheese stuffed pork chop that is also featured here on Yelp"}
{"text":"Read so many good reviews, I decided to check this place out. Bacon, egg & cheese old fashioned home made biscuit. I followed that up with a chocolate croissant...simply delicious! Had their pumpkin spice coffee, which blows Starbucks off the map! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Small place with very limited seating. Unfortunately there were some folks there using the dining space as an office and one gentleman who decided to take up a 6 seat table for himself. With that being said, rudeness and courtesy are not the places fault!

On to the food...best described as outstanding quality, good presentation, and very good service. I ordered the meatball sandwich on fresh baked white bread and it was excellent. Not smothered in marinara like some places do to hide the bland flavor of the meatballs, Millstones allows the flavor of the meatball to come thru and only accented by the light marinara and cheese. Very very good. 

Good spot, great food, good service but limited seating. Enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This is real bread people. I'm talking big holes in the crumb, soft moist inside and a SERIOUS crust. I don't think I've had anything that can compare. I was seriously stunned by how fantastically well each and every style of bread was executed. 

Also, Sara, the proprietor cares about where every single ingredient in her shop comes from. Every veggie comes from a farmer she knows (when it's not coming from her own farm! that's right, her own farm!) Every cheese it artisan and hand crafted --- many of them using local milk. 

On top of that -- and one of my personal favorite things about Millstone-- is that there is a FABULOUS wine selection...even (gasp) by the glass to choose from along with one of her fantastic bites. Too little people care about taking any time to create a decent wine list unless they are in a huge space with a large cellar.... a small but creative and well crafted list can be achieved-- Sara has done it in her shop.

Catch her bread at the Davidson Farmer's Market as well.

No complaints here--- just wish I lived a little closer!"}
{"text":"Great bread. Got here just before 12 and I barely got a seat.  Had the bacon egg and cheddar on sprouted wheat. Awesome."}
{"text":"Super mimosas and quiche and you have to try the salmon bacon. But the almond roll is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had the Tuscan Turkey sandwich on 5/31/14.  I am giving this a 3 star rating only because of the pricing.  The food was delicious, but $11.31 for a sandwich with no side item or beverage is way overpriced.  Probably won't be back merely because it's overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love this place.   We've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and every meal has been amazing.    We especially love the dinners on the weekend, with a simple menu of a meat and seafood dish.  We have named the Tuscan turkey on sour dough bread \"the best sandwich in the world\", although we have promised ourselves that we need to try some of the other sandwiches, since we know they will be delicious too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent staff and their turkey sandwich was delightful. I'm a big fan of farm to table. 

Don't miss out on this new welcome addition to the area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We usually order take out because you never really know what kind of service you will get, but the food is DELISH.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the menu, wine selection and sidewalk ambience of this restaurant.  However, each time we go there we get a laundry list of what they're out of.  So it's hit or miss in terms of getting what you really want. Tonight service was unexplainably slow. Consistency could be vastly improved."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Neighborhood feel with wonderful food.  It never disappoints.  It can get crowded but the wines are plenty and a table usually becomes available."}
{"text":"Really cute farmhouse design, and terrific food. Had the raspberry mascarpone french toast (daily special) and it was refreshing, light, and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Millstone Bake House & Provisions in downtown Davidson, NC. This bakery/restaurant uses organic, natural and local ingredients in all of their food. 

When you first walk in, it appears to be primarily a bakery. But, they also offer a variety of salads, sandwiches, and specials to satisfy your lunchtime appetite.

Dora here. This place would be a perfect choice for a lazy Saturday morning, especially during the warmer weather when you could sit outside. Do NOT plan to go here if you're in a hurry. It was jammed, and service, while helpful, was a tad slow.

For lunch, I chose the Grilled Ham & Cheese, chili and fries. The sandwich was loaded with real cooked ham, not typical deli ham, and grilled to perfection. The half sandwich was larger than most full sandwiches, and I liked the little kick from the spicy mustard. The chili was full of favor, light on meat but loaded with multi-types of beans. The shoestring fries are my favorite, and I had to fight my wife off from eating all of them. 

What? I did not steal any of those pencil-thin fries!! You lucked out on the soup, too, because I prefer only pinto beans in my chili. And it's a good thing I ordered iced tea and not a latte. I would've laughed if they set that coffee cup in front of me! What do you think? How's this for perspective?

Good thing I ordered the iced tea! I would've laughed at the size of this coffee cup.
The Ham and Asparagus Quiche was a good choice. Although I'm not a huge fan of asparagus, it wasn't overpowering. Everything came together in a light and fresh combination. 

What's your favorite breakfast food? Do you enjoy quiche?
 
We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"They never let me down. The service is consistently awful.  They always manage to ruin the experience no matter how good the food. Just get it to go and save yourself the drama. 

CLOSED! No surprises there."}
{"text":"Food is good - especially their pastries. Although every time we go we leave slightly frustrated bc their service isn't great - slow (even for takeout), somewhat chaotic at times and NOT good for children. They do not have high chairs or booster seats which makes the long wait even more frustrating. The also serve a great salad with their sandwiches, but when you get this to-go they combine the items in the same box essentially ruined the sandwich bc the dressing soaks into the bread.  This place could be so much better if they'd pay a bit more attention to the small details and provide better service."}
{"text":"Yum yum nomnom OMG.  Our server recommended the quiche saying it would be the best we have ever had.  She was 100% correct.  

Cozy Cafe with indoor and outdoor seating.  pretty crowded on a Saturday around noon so we sat at the bar.  Coffee was really good and appears to be locally roasted.

Finished off our meal with a raspberry scone warmed.  Again...amazing.  These people know how to bake.  Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The most delicious meal we have had so far in NC with excellent attentive service.  Be warned that they do not start serving their dinner menu until 5.30 pm and there is a gap between lunchtime service which ends around 4pm. During this time you can however order beautifully presented cheese or charcuterie plates with a glass of wine.  We wanted an early dinner as we had skipped lunch and, as we were in the middle of the lunch/dinner gap, we ordered a small cheese plate - Camembert & Manchego with extra olives - this came with a yummy mix of breads and fruit.  Once the dinner hour was nigh we were presented with a menu, almost all of which I would have been happy to have tried - I had the lobster ravioli to start, which was outstanding, followed by steelhead salmon, served on puy lentils with a leek sauce and crisp, fresh julienned vegetables. This was the best salmon I believe I have ever eaten. Do not miss this gem if you are passing through Davidson!"}
{"text":"They should have a place like this in every town. Such a great place to get away, sit and have a good bite to eat with a glass of wine. Or it's accessible to just grab the weekly bread and cheese. Sara (owner) has what she likes there and boy, does she have great taste. This place is near perfection."}
{"text":"I moved from LA two years ago and can honestly say the quality of the bread and pastries are totally on par with the places in LA. Their cinnamon pecan roll is awesome. Tried their salted caramel tart which is rich, delicious, and good for sharing. Have tried a few other pastries too which have all been great. Also been here for breakfast which is good but in general are things I could probably cook at home. And their breakfast menu is pretty limited. Finally have also been here for lunch to try their Tina melt and turkey club-both delicious. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very crowded with a strange set-up.  The croissants and danish were underbaked and the \"scones\" were weirdly gummy and flat.  I'm not sure what their forté is but we won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Food was incredible; service not so much.  Pricier than I had anticipated at a counter service style eatery."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich on your choice of fresh baked breads.  Fresh eggs and yummy cheese.  But the kicker was trying the homemade apple cake.  Cream cheese filled, Carmel drizzled divinity! With a cup of java nothing better.  This was my first time here. We will come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim for lunch and we are so glad we did. A hip, casual vibe set the stage for an excellent meal. The open kitchen lets you see all the homemade artisan breads and they looked fantastic so we ordered sandwiches. I had a thick homemade chicken salad on a focaccia style bread while my hubby had a generous turkey sandwich and a to-die-for tomato and basil soup. It was hard to resist the pastries. We learned from our server, Kimmy, that a baking crew comes in every day at 3 a.m. to do the baking. Dedication! We sampled the chocolate croissant with its endless layers of paper thin flakiness, and the warm 7-layer bar of decadent goodness. Wow. We look forward to another great meal, and will be eager to try out the sister restaurant upstairs, the Upper Crust. I peeked at the seafood-oriented menu and it looked fantastic."}
{"text":"My only wish was that the menu was a bit clearer and that I could see all of my options.  There were quiches, breakfast sandwiches, breakfast plates, mac & cheese...  I ordered a breakfast sandwich on their crusty white bread, one of my friends ordered a quiche.   We ordered at the counter, paid, and got a number.

It was a gorgeous February day and we grabbed a table out front.  We waited a bit, and our drinks came out.  Then after a bit, our food came out. 

I was surprised when my breakfast sandwich came with a cute little salad and slice of mango.  The sandwich was delicious, just the right amount of bacon, egg & cheese on delicious slices of crusty bread.

When Toast has lines out the door, make the venture down the street to Millstone.  A great brunch alternative."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you what the food is like. Was told wait would be 35 minutes. Continued to check in to make sure they didn't forget about us and kept getting the run around... Another 20 minutes and we will have a table. 1hr 45 minutes later we finally got a call that a table was ready. Really!"}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast. Eggs over easy with bacon and sourdough toast. With drink bill was almost 20.00.  Eggs were oily. Bacon soft and lukewarm.  Toast was excellent.  Even for local farm to table ingredients, a little overpriced.   Service was slow but friendly.  Overall, ok but won't be returning...at least not for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just popping in for a delectable treat. Unique experience and chef prepared food. This is not a fast food or chain restaurant, it's a gourmet shop with farm-table entrees, homemade pasta and bread dishes, salads/soups and unique appetizers. The wine selection is fantastic! The ambiance is quaint, the service is real and it is a special to Davidson."}
{"text":"Excellent food & excellent service!! They're not trying too hard, just quality food. 
My favorite is the cheese and charcuterie menu!! 
Wish there was a better beer selection (at least 1 IPA on tap and maybe a few bottles options) and wish they had a liquor license."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time at Millstone.  Chicken salad on the homemade sourdough bread was delic...their cup of French onion soup on the side was also very good.  Atmosphere is a small café which is cozy.  Desserts are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Food once you get it is good but service is totally lacking.

Millstone is a bakery 7 deli just up the street from where we go to Church and I've wanted to try it for some time.  I'm a fan of the farm to fork movement and they specialize in locally grown provisions.

My wife and I walked in around 1 pm and were promptly seated.  Layout like many places in Davidson is a shotgun with one long room stretching from the front door to  the back. No problems with that.

We were seated at a small table in the middle and our server soon appeared and gave up a menu and took our drink order.  My wife had coffee with no problem. I ordered Sweet Tea with Lemon and they did not have any. They had several alternatives including green tea and green tea with lemonade so I chose the later.

My wife ordered a quiche and guess what? They were out.  Finally settled on a Ham and Cheese Sandwich.  I chose a Tuscan Turkey with Cheese Sandwich on Sourdough Bread. Mac and Cheese was on the menu and my wife asked if she could get that as her side and was told she would have to pay almost full price for it because the size was bigger and they could not adjust down to a the size of a side.

When my lemonade or rather an Arnold Palmer made with Green Tea arrived, it was striated into two layers and we had no utensils so I could not mix it and our server had disappeared.  Borrowed a ball point pen from my wife and both she and the server who showed up just as I was stirring the beverage, were horrified. He asked why I was doing that and I replied, \"No Silverware\"

Simple order but it took over 20 minutes for two simple sandwiches with a side of Potato Salad.  Do beware however because a young lady at the next table asked the server what was Sourdough and he told her they put sour cream in it. I've heard of this shortcut in the past but that does not make artisianal  Sourdough.

Once we our order arrived, it was very good. Tasty, plenty of meat, good texture and a decent attempt on presentation.  The Potato Salad was very good but they were a bit heavy on the mustard which was a spicy mustard and tended to overpower what is suppose to be a very simple dish.

While they have a good menu, don't depend on it since many items run out early. Service is very lacking and as such, would not recommend"}
{"text":"Cozy space on the corner of downtown Davidson. Morning pastries, quiches and breakfast sandwiches are available until 4 on Saturday's. Lunch menu has sandwiches and salads. They offer salmon bacon, but I didn't try it. Also have desserts-- cake by the slice, beer and wine. Local ingredients, made fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been to Millstone many times & had great experiences. However, the last few times the service has been terrible. They have a waiter who isn't up to the job. He only gets part of the order & never comes back to check on if you need anything, like the drink I  ordered. I had to go ask for it last time. Also, when I got quiche last time, there was SO MUCH garlic that garlic should have been named as an ingredient; i.e., Garlic and vegetable quiche. It will be a while before we go back. Who wants bad service and bad food, plus the fun of paying too much for it?"}
{"text":"Hats off to Sarah and her team. Great staff, high caliber locally sourced food and a family atmosphere. As a long time resident of Texas now transplanted in Davidson they have the best steak anywhere. However, it does not stop there. All the dishes are carefully presented and well taken care of for a great eating experience. 
I eat out 3 nights a week all over the country. Millstone is still my favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a little lunch and wine a couple weeks ago and I was SO happy I did.  I freaking love this place.  Mmmmm.....cheese plate.  It looked fantastic and perfect, though I did not have one.  The wine selection was decent.  This place has a very European feel.  Since it was my first time there, I was a bit confused on whether I take a seat, order at the counter, wait to be seated, etc.  No one welcomed me or explained anything so I took a seat at the bar and waited (for about ten minutes) before I had to ask for a menu.  During the lunch to dinner shift change, it seemed very disorganized, but perhaps they were having a bad day.  This did not stop me from loving the place and I will be back.  The pretty young lady at the bar was very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Huge fan, glad to see they've tightened up in a couple areas recently. Great improvement in consistency of customer service, music seems to always be interesting eclectic and easy on the ears, and quality of the clean exquisite food that regulars expect is also consistent and stellar. Looks like they have done some staff switching and appointed a staff member up to manager that keeps things positive for the customers and seems to keep operations running smoothly and in line with the owners vision. The energy as you walk through the door is palpably upbeat and relaxed and a pleasant delicious place to come, for a decadent selection of sticky and elegant pastries, healthy protein veggie breakfast, or tea,  scone and morning paper in the sun..."}
{"text":"Great date night dinner. Yummy fried oysters, lobster ravioli was awesome and the porkchop stuffed with cheese was to die for.  Very small restaurant. Attentive staff. We will back."}
{"text":"Definitely a local feel! The wine choices are superb and the food, oh my, you must get a charcuterie board with their in house made bread. Don't fill up all on cheese and bread, a MUST try is their lobster ravioli!!! This place will be my new hang out"}
{"text":"The food was OK, service was horrible. Our server never came back to check on us. Our water was empty, to make matters worst...the server only came to refill the water for the table beside us and just totally skipped us. We had to flag the waitress down just to pay our tab. Neatly to say I'll never return here again!"}
{"text":"Millstone is the PERFECT addition to the growing Davidson food scene. Their breads are European style and are absolutely DELICIOUS! Yes, their prices are higher than at the supermarket, but the ingredients used and quality of the product is worth every, single penny. This is REAL BREAD. The sandwiches and specialty items are amazing, as well. Long Live Millstone!"}
{"text":"I am continually dissatisfied with the service here. I have never had a positive dine in or take out experience. The wait staff is extremely slow, rude, and unapproachable. My orders are consistently messed up and when I point out the mistakes the staff makes no move or offer to reimburse me or make me a new meal. Even when asking for something as simple a refill of water, the staff acts as if I have inconvenienced them. 

The food here is delicious, and this is the only reason I return."}
{"text":"Very cute when you walk in but I was a little confused what they where when I first walked in. Are you a bakery? A to-go place? Coffee shop or wine bar? I Think they are trying to do a all in one thing but it was confusing, and our waitress seemed upset that we walked in and sat ourselves. I did not understand what to do, so I just sat down because it is a small Place. The food is over priced especially for breakfast. I understand it's \"fresh from the farm\" but I was a little shocked when I got my bill. Does have a cute small town feel I am sure that's why people go back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Takes me to Europe. The food is superb. The ambiance is unique and welcoming. It is like stepping into a bistro/brasserie. Sara Hord, woman chef, farmer and owner, opened Millstone Bakehouse And Provisions in a historic building in historic downtown Davidson on April 2014, after several years of selling her goods at the area's farmer's markets. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, charcuterie and cheese plates, artisan breads and gourmet pastries, coffee and tea, boutique wines and craft beers. The establishment has an open layout, flanked by a pastries counter on one side and a wine and beer bar on the other side. Sit at the two large communal tables or at several of the small individual tables. Or seat outdoors at the sidewalk tables or at the back porch tables. The menu is seasonal and it also changes daily and/or weekly. Farm to fork with the ingredients being mostly locally sourced and the majority organic."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon in between the lunch and dinner crowds.  Practically empty restaurant with some of the staff taking breaks chatting with friends/regulars and others doing prep for the dinner crowd.  

So I order a sandwich, no big deal right?  Well it ends up taking 30 minutes to get which just seems so surprisingly long considering other folks came in after me and got there food after about 5 minutes.  I saw my sandwich come out of the oven and was resting on the counter but the server took it to another table.  I then hear the owner talk to that server saying that she thinks they sent that sandwich to the wrong table.  Well 5 minutes later they bring out my sandwich after finally remembering I ordered something.  

The sandwich was good and fine and all, but the awful service experience completely ruined it for me.  If the service is this slow or bad when they aren't busy, I sure am not going during prime hours."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonight for dinner, & it was delicious! the staff were super friendly and courteous, the service was a little slow but our waiter was training a new girl which is completely understandable! Started off with the cheese plate; we chose a soft Brie & mustard seed cheddar. It came with 3 different breads, a delicious jam, & a cup of fresh strawberries. For the meal I had the vegetable ravioli which was fantastic. A friend had their chicken wings & was very pleased. I will definitely be coming again :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here with some friends for some coffee and dessert.   Cool little place that has dessert but also has entrees.  We each had something different.  We tried the brownie, red velvet cake and raspberry bread pudding with chocolate sauce.  The majority really liked their desserts.  Browie and Raspberry Bread Pudding were really good.  The red velvet cake got mixed reviews.  

All in all this is a cool place to come and hang out.  Like I said, you can get everything from drinks to dessert and everything in between.  Will return to try more things next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went here for a meal and to study for the gmats and it was an absolutely perfect setting. The food is great and the ambiance was fantastic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I had chicken salad on sprouted wheat. Delicious. Chicken salad was not typical but fresh and satisfying. My friend had the white bean soup and said it was great. I will return."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast special, a pulled pork biscuit with eggs cooked your way, medium for me.  It was absolutely amazing!  Although I was completely full, I could've eaten another!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Love the banana pudding, the absolute best! :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I loved walking in and they have big bowls with dough rising
They had homemade quiches, breads, chocolate pastries, etc. I got to pick out and make my own breakfast sandwich and it seems that you can customize your lunch sandwiches and salads as well. I'm totally going back here!

Ok, I've been back and lunch and dinner were just as amazing. A new favorite in Davidson."}
{"text":"Is this what bread is supposed to taste like? If so, I'll never go low carb again. The food here is absolutely delicious. I had the pimento ham biscuit and it was really good. I ordered it to go so they didn't heat it up for me (I wish they had) but even cold it was very good. The iced coffee I had was also great. I drink my coffee black so I can always tell when it's really good stuff. I'll definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"What I love about this unique  & friendly eatery is that they support local farmers and use organic ingredients grown in Eco-friendly ways.  With an eclectic offering of wines from various countries, regions and appellations, their breads and cheeses simply push this place to the top of our family's list. It also serves as a great venue for a \"girls night out\" according to my wife. From the exotic offerings of cheeses to their unbelievably unique and scrumptious chicken salad sandwich, families will find something for everyone. You will never leave hungry or disappointment. And, if nothing else, try their sourdough!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I need to update my review because I have enjoyed dinner at Millstone now and I also spend almost every Saturday morning there for brunch after my workout.  The bakery items are so good and always offer different flavors in their scones, tarts and cakes.  Oh, and the biscuit is my Saturday favorite!  Service here is hit or miss but we overlook it every time, because we love the food so much.  **I will note that service tends to be better (at least recently) at the side hall tables**  Enjoy!  Say \"hi\" if you see me there.

^*also a great spot to work during a weekday, outside of meal times, of course"}
{"text":"What a delight! My wife and I went there for dinner on a Saturday night, and we were blown away by how great the food and the service were at this little casual and simple place. We started with a cheese and dried meats platter, serve with fresh breads and the most amazing preserves I've ever had. Would recommend the Mahon cheese, the Goat Cheese Truffles, the Mild Salami, and the Prosciutto. For our small platter meals we ordered the crab cake, the smoked duck breast, and the lobster ravioli. All perfectly cooked and made with high-quality ingredients - highly recommend each of these dishes. Lastly we had a slice of chocolate and caramel cake that as my wife put it \"was the Vatican of cakes\". Our server was very personable, could speak clearly to and was passionate about the menu, and made great recommendations. We arrived at a good time and only had to wait a few minutes to get seated, but shortly afterwards the wait appeared to get much longer, so I could potentially see that as a problem for a return trip and to be expected for a great place. We'll for sure look to come back for Dinner and hopefully for breakfast/lunch too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a morsel after going by the dry cleaner on Saturday afternoon. Asked for a slice of quiche and found a seat near the bar. A young lady came by shortly with water and flat ware and eventually the quiche-and-bitter greens arrived as well. I asked for a middling red to accompany the the fare and as I set to the greens I heard the matron mutter something about the impropriety of red with eggs at luncheon. None the less a flavorful glass came forth and I finished my meal.
The quiche was uninspired even for left overs; the crust too crusty from reheating and a tad shy on greens. I suppose it's my fault for not being very specific with my wine request but I'd expect 'middling' to rate well shy of $10. Ah well, won't make that mistake again..."}
{"text":"This was my first trip here and honestly we came just for the donuts that Your Mom's Donuts delivers on the weekend.  I was amazed by the friendliness of the staff and how accommodating they were.  My wife and I sat out front and sipped some coffee  anxiously waiting for the donuts to drive.  

They finally got there and they were worth the wait. We had the cinnamon brown sugar peach and mmmmmmm! Can't described the amazingness. 
I will definitely return to try some of the bread that is baked in house."}
{"text":"Saturday morning and they're out of espresso. What do you mean, no espresso? Well maybe they should walk over to Summit and buy a bag? I had a croissant which was oily and under baked. The boy had eggs with cheese and bacon on a biscuit. He said it all tasted like it was made yesterday. The set up is strange - they want to seat you as soon as you walk in but the menu is written on the wall. The menu we were given had half the options that the board does. We wanted to get a look at the pastries then sit outside. The servers seemed clueless and kept switching out. So to summarize -  no espresso, stale tasting food, off service. Skip it."}
{"text":"Can we get the health dept to give a few pointers? One time I needed pastries cut in half and there is the baker cutting away with her freaking hands ungloved and on the pastries. 2nd time I see a waitress inserting utensils into rolled napkins - holding each utensil by the part that goes in the mouth instead of holding them by the handle. Freakin gross and outrageous that they don't know better."}
{"text":"Millstone is a tiny, cozy, place that can get very crowded at breakfast.  They are a bit pricey for the morning meal, but their food is good, and worth a return visit.

I love being able to get an espresso drink along with a breakfast sandwich.  Their sandwiches are handmade and generously filled.  I love their bacon, egg, and cheddar on white bread.  It sounds simple, but the sandwich is served with a side salad (with a delicious dressing!), and is large enough to share, especially if you add a chocolate croissant or other pastry.  The sandwiches are a bit buttery on the outside, so get extra napkins!

Their espressos and lattes are very good.  They don't have soy milk, but instead, offer almond milk.  It's a mildly sweet substitute, and I love the nutty flavor.  I'll start getting almond milk more often now because I love the taste.  

We tried Millstone recently for dinner, and the food was very good, but also very expensive.  The lobster ravioli came with four small raviolis at $18.95.  It was delicious, but the prices were too high for such a small plate (I think $13 is more reasonable, given the size).  Given that the atmosphere doesn't really match the prices, I'm not sure we'll be back for the evening meal."}
{"text":"It's good but a little snooty! It could be much better with staff and management. The food is good but \"they know it\"."}
{"text":"Ok- so it's been a frequent few weeks of me coming here at least once a week and I feel NOT writing a review is just wrong!! At first I started coming here for just wine, then my fiancé and I started coming for breakfast.. And now that they expanded their dinner menu a while back, it's been hard to NOT come for dinner every single weekend. The food is fresh, delicious, and full of flavor!! The menu and food is definitely pretty pricey, but that seems to be common for farm to table dining! Love the salmon, the romaine salad, the pastas, and so much more! This place is great for a Weekend brunch, a girls night, a date night, or even just a glass of wine and a cheese board night to sit outside ;) well done!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend this weekend at Millhouse. It was fantastic. All of the food tasted home made and super fresh.  I had the chicken salad over mixed greens and a cup of soup. Both were fantastic and left me satisfied.  Beyond the food however the service was great. Everyone was super friendly and attentive without being over bearing.  Definitely worth stopping in for a quick breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"I was in Wednesday morning for a quick breakfast and cup of coffee. One of the servers, (I actually think she may have been a manager, short brown hair) seemed to be much more interested with her cell phone than helping customers. I asked for a refill on my coffee and I felt as if I was inconveniencing her. My food was good enough, but the service was lackluster. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe for lunch.  My wife and I have added it to our list and we have never been disappointed.  They were an instant success from the time they opened their doors.

I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Their veggie quiche is my favorite. I love the atmosphere too. I will not order cappuccino again... it's the smallest that I've ever seen.. more like macchiato."}
{"text":"They make a awesome olive loaf but I wish they folded the lives into the bread. They also make wonderful tarts for brunch. The staff is nice and friendly and once we purchased a stale loaf and they exchanged it as soon as we brought it back."}
{"text":"Sadly, Millstone closed on April 30th, 2017.  They will not re-open."}
{"text":"I go here regularly for lunch and couldn't pick a better place. The cozy atmosphere and great food are complimented by the attentive staff. The food is all sourced from a farm or made healthy which means a lot    The go to lunch option of fresh turkey sandwich or the on point specials are always great! 
Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, this place is the best for the bread, and even for a breakfast or lunch meal. They are a staple at the Davidson Farmers Market and had so much business they opened up a storefront right on Main St. This review is based on having lunch at the brick and mortar location.

It's always busy in there, especially on a weekend, but it is totally worth the wait. It'sa small shop so it can be a little cramped, but there is usually some extra seating at the wine bar. All the food is fresh made and these use local ingredients. That being said, they offer different sandwiches and meals on different days, depending on what they have. I ordered the ham sandwich, and this thing was anything but the kind you would get at Subway or any deli for that matter. The ham was fresh carved, leaving me feeling like I was eating Easter leftovers rather than a ham sandwich at a restaurant. The cheese they paired with it was perfect, and came out oozy and salty. And then the bread...all of their breads are awesome, and make the best sandwiches ever.

On the way out we grabbed a chocolate chip cookie to split, and eating only half of it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. It was warm, gooey and extremely chocolaty...a home run cookie by far. I highly recommend stopping in there for lunch, and make sure to pick up some extra bread for the week while you're there too."}
{"text":"Not good! Server was very nice but poorly trained. Order was all messed up, waters and coffees never got refilled. Food was not great either. There was very little to choose from and it was incredibly greasy."}
