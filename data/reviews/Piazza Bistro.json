{"text":"This place will consistently make you an amazing Americano,  and their scones are just delicious - served on a little wood plank with butter and a lovely jam. Sitting on their patio on a summer Saturday morning is lovely. You will not be served right away (even if you're standing right there and have been noticed by the staff) and you will wait longer than you feel you should to receive your food - the staff certainly don't take any pains to be complement the experience of deliciousness with efficiency/initiative, but it is easy to overlook because once you do get your food,  it's just yummy. The decor is beautiful. One of my favourite places in oakville!"}
{"text":"There are some crazy reviews by some crazy people here saying that Piazza's food is anything less than perfect. I had the fortunate experience of grabbing a quick bite for lunch here yesterday and let me tell you this place is 100% AUTHENTIC ITALIAN APPROVED.  I went for their special pasta of the day yesterday which was a freshly made Parpadelle made with a lamb ragu. HOLY SHIT. I think I blacked out when I ate it. It was so good that one minute I had a full plate, and then the next, it was gone. This was not for lack of portion size, it was perfect for lunch, but I just devoured it.  The noodles were so fresh they popped with every bite in my mouth and cooked to beyond perfection. And that ragu? Wow, made to order sauce done with generous morsels of lamb meat throughout, it was a fantastic dish, one that I want for breakfast as I write this review.  The location is a tad hard to find but totally worth seeking out. This hidden gem is located below street level just off of Oakville Town Square (west side of the square). As you walk down you might think this is just a gelato/pastry/sandwich shop for taking away, and they do have THAT, but making a right hand turn opens you up to a intimate, beautiful dining room with great design and lighting which can make for a relaxing mid day lunch or an intimate romantic dinner for two. I'm adding this to my list of date night recommendations!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. The decor is fantastic and so is the food.   The staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing circa 2015. I don't know what happened. I ordered the usual linguini fruitti demare which tasted like pure salt. My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs which would've been great but again was pure salt. We also got the Caesar salad as a starter which tasted like nothing. It had zero dressing and resembled nothing of a Caesar salad. It tasted like bland lettuce.   I am very sad as this used to be a favourite restaurant and I was excited to take my husband for the first time. I think the chef changed. The table beside us ordered the special which was a Steak and it was cooked rare when she ordered it medium and the other table beside us didn't finish their Caesar salad or pizza either and looked disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there on evening of Midnight Madness. All the food was bland at best and under seasoned. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the pistachio gelato and the lemon & basil gelato in their smallest cup size, total came out to $4.15 including taxes. You can try the diff flavours before ordering. The gelato was so flavourful. I could taste the sourness of the lemon with a hint of basil taste. The pistachio is a must for pistachio lovers."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place as we looked for a place to eat for dinner. We sat in the patio area since it was nice outside. I didn't see the interior but my friend said it was nice when she went to the washroom. The service was slow, in my opinion. It was hard to grab their attention a couple of times. We ordered bread on to dip on the mussel sauce which took a while to come to our table.  We ordered Calabrese pizza and mussels with white wine and pomodoro sauce. The pizza has pomodoro sauce, mozarella, calabrese spicy sausage, and oregano. It was a very simple pizza but I felt like it was missing something. Some spice or an oomf factor. It was still a decent pizza. The mussels were great. Definitely taste the white wine. They served it in a good hefty amount."}
{"text":"The pasta here was bland and flavourless and the service was very slow. The server was pleasant enough but it didn't make up for the lack lustre experience. I will not return to this restaurant for anything but an espresso."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We put our name on the list to sit outside and the wait was 1 and a half hour. For the location of this restaurant, I wasn't surprised. Then the hostess suggested immediate inside seating and I went inside to check it out and it looked better than on the outside. I convinced the rest of the party (my wife and aunt Terry) and we ended up dinning indoors.  The burrata was the first item on the menu and this is what we came in for. The presentation was very nice and even it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, I thought it was great. Then we had the spicy \"ando\" sausage pizza, which was amazing along with the PEI muscles.  I had couple bites of my wife's veal limone which was great. The complimentary bread wasn't good, but not worth the complain.  Finally, we ended at the gelato bar and it was by far the best ice cream I've had. We will come back for this alone.  Excellent place! Given the touristic area and the high traffic of new people, this place is doing great."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome pizza! They nailed the ratio of ingredients to dough and will definitely have me coming back for more. Great service and decor"}
{"text":"My review is as simple as this and to tell readers only this:  For the most authentic Italian pizza in Oakville, perhaps Ontario, come here!   Yes the service is great.  Yes the rest of the food is too.  And you can't beat the patio, especially when Summer events in the square are going on.   But for me, \"la pizza e come fatto a Napoli!!!\"   And for those looking for \"classic deep dish\" or \"thick crust\" pizza, there ain't anything \"classic\" about them in Italy, so don't expect them here!"}

{"text":"Great find. No reviews, so we took a chance on a patio in downtown Oakville. Though to find too many, but this on was right in a square, you could people watch and enjoy some solid Italian, we split a salad and each had a pasta. Menu was not huge, but the food was delicious!  Meatballs and Spaghetti satisfied my hunger, and I was hungry. The mushroom pasta with chicken added was also fantastic.  Nice atmosphere outside."}
