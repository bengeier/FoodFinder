{"text":"Been here a couple of times for brunch and was pleased. Good food, nice atmosphere. They're still young and new with a few kinks to work out, but I'm confident and excited to see where this place goes in the next year!"}
{"text":"I found it difficult to review this place.  The most difficult part was that the friendliness of the staff and awesomeness of the atmosphere was much better than the quality of the food.  Not to say that the food was bad in any way.  It's just that the owner of the place is a sweet sweet fellow and his head server is similarly amazing.  Good things first.  The patio is gorgeous.  Not too many tables, but the ones they have are really nice and the lighting and ambience are one of the best in the city.  It's a back patio so it's nice and quiet.  The service is also amazing, I sat in the patio for the better part of two hours and they let me idle there without any bother.  My criticisms are gentle, but I think need to be made. First, I started off with the \"spicy\" chicken lime tortilla soup.  I'll say this there was nothing spicy about said soup.  Thought it was tasty, it really would have benefited from a little spice.  Also, I mean this as a constructive criticism, the bowl was kind of awkward, made it hard to consume the soup.  My second criticism is that they timed the delivery of my main wrong.  Nothing spells amateur hour more than having your main delivered as you're in the midst of your appetizer.  I went with the cuban pork, carnitas and bacon sandwich.  It was good, especially for the $14 price point, but not necessarily anything I'd brag about.  I finished with the porter chocolate mouse which was decent for 6 bites, repetitive thereafter.  But again, what I REALLY loved about the place was the the waitstaff was amazing and the patio is great.  Also their bar is sophisticated and great.  The owner is so cool as is his waitstaff that I really wish I could rate this joint higher but the food didn't quite get there for me.  If you want to go there for drinks though, this place is top notch, and the patio is worth the visit."}
{"text":"I considered my self a regular of Brooklyn tavern till last week. Although I really like this place, 4 out of 5 times I wated too long for food, so it's a kind of a turn off. The waitress are nice, the food it's great, the bar it'impressive, but I really hate waiting 50 minutes for a burger with fries. Loved it and hate it."}
{"text":"Had a very nice Skirt steak salad on a cold, winter's night - Blue Monday to be precise - so nice to have a decent eatery down here in Leslieville that's open on a Monday night!"}
{"text":"I am really surprised by some of the reviews on here, I am one of those people who love the Brooklyn Tavern. I know there are others because it's always busy when we go.  I go there every Friday and I always look forward to it, the owners are friendly and accommodating and the staff have always been very good to us. We have been been looking for a good local pub since we move to Leslieville and we finally found one. There are other options but some of them are very expensive for tiny portions, or have a more Firkin like feel but the food would be awful. The Brooklyn is the first place we have found near us that has good food, service, and reasonable prices.  I have tried quite a few things on the menu and my favorite by far is the open faced lamb sandwich, I usually get fries with it instead of coleslaw. The giant meatball is excellent and we found the mac and cheese to be very good. The salsa verde pork wasn't to my taste, but they used to have totopos with red salsa... and that salsa was the best I ever tasted (I wish I could get the recipe). They also have a new vegetarian/vegan chili which was amazing.   Prices are in line with Leslieville, and we are primarily wine and beer drinkers.  I haven't had their brunch so I can't comment on that, but I will be going to the Brooklyn Tavern again and again. Apparently they will also have a patio in the Spring or Summer, so that should be nice too."}
{"text":"Great to find a brunch place with more than the usual eggs and waffles fare.  Had the pulled chicken quinoa salad and it was perfectly balanced.  Brunch date LOVED the Brooklyn Caesar!  Lives up to its New York name."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious brunch on Saturday. Everything was good. The service was quick. Loved the atmosphere on the restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband last weekend to try out their brunch menu as we are SICK of lady marmalade. No place in my opinion is that good to wait 30 mins in a line up!!! I opted for the \"divorced poach eggs\" and my husband got the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with an egg on top. Both were AMAZING!!! Staff were very friendly and inviting and made us feel at home. We dined in their new patio which was v.cute. We will definitely come back to Brooklyn tavern again!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to shout about but not bad.   Servicer was unexcited to be there.   Had squid which was cooked well but the sauce is not a great match, sprouts tasted ok but had been steamed so we're a bit soggy, Arctic char tasted good but was 30 seconds over, the potatoes were either undercooked (1 or 2) or were on the absolute border line.  Won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Toronto in September for a few days and had the pleasure of randomly picking Brooklyn Tavern for brunch.  The staff was wonderfully accommodating; Our waiter ever drew a map for us to show us some other cool places to visit that day!  Our brunch was very good, but what is most memorable was their Caesar (a Bloody Mary to my fellow Americans).  SUPERB!  Seriously, their Caesar was one of the highlights from our trip.  My only suggestion is that the staff do something about the crazy hornets on the back patio."}
{"text":"So far I really like this place. I have been twice now, only for brunch but intend to go back soon. Their patio is lovely and cozy and tucked away in the back. You quickly forget you are on Queen Street. Inside has a really great feel to it and the staff are great! The place strikes me as a good choice to become a regular at."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my husband and 2 kids.  We had an excellent meal (French toast, huevos rancheros, Mac and cheese) and the service was great,  We will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my husband, once for dinner when it opened and then again today for brunch.   I still find the place's decor confusing with TVs playing sports while the rest of the place is decorated to be a higher end pub. That aside our first meal was mediocre so it's taken awhile before we wanted to venture back.   For brunch today I had the Cubano Croissant and my husband the Arugula warm beet salad. The Cubano was layers of bacon an egg and avocado salsa. It was spicy but not over the top. It came with French fries which were cool when they arrived, but the homemade chipotle mayo helped make up for this.   The arugula salad had spring beets and goat cheese with a light vinaigrette dressing. My husband described it as average for the price point.   Our total bill came to about $30 for two meals and one Americano so not outrageous for the neighbourhood. However with so many other great local brunch spots to choose from we'll likely not be back."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the good was well made, and so tasty.  This is a place I will come back to many times!!"}
{"text":"The food and cocktail for brunch were okay...but the service was horrible. It wasnt even crowded, but apologies for slowness were nonstop."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!  Unique choices that left us wanting to lick our plates. Parking free on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Five star service and five star food. Nice interior which is both classy and relaxed/casual.  The menu is diverse and all the offerings are tempting. A lot of the dishes have some original twists and interesting combinations to keep you mulling over the menu for a while!   Our server was delightfully friendly and sweet and helped explain the menu and accommodate any customisations my party had. Everyone at my table loved what they ordered, from a diverse range of orders including the squid, the salmon burrito, the lamb sandwich and the roast chicken with bok choy.  I sampled some of the fries and they were perrrrfect - skinny,c rispy, and nicely seasoned. The salmon salsa burrito may sound a bit too quirky on paper, but it worked out really well in reality. The salmon was perfectly grilled and of excellent quality, there was just the right amount of salsa and the burrito was nice and light, so it didn't overcomplicate things. I sampled some of the chicken with bok choy  and I would definitely be interested in ordering this for my next visit - it was delish and the cauliflower worked really well with the bok choy. I'm not a fan of squid or lamb, but those at my table who ordered these dishes really loved them.  The only thing stopping me becoming a regular here would be the prices. It's not that everything is overpriced; some dishes are very reasonable, such as the sandwiches and burgers ($14). But $24 for the salmon burrito (which didn't come with any side or anything else except the actual moderately sized salmon burrito) is just too expensive for the portion received. Same could be said for the roast chicken and the squid. I don't understand the variance in prices as all the portion sizes worked out about the same.  With a bit more consistency in terms of pricing this place would probably get 5 stars. I look forward to trying their brunch offerings in the near future (when I get paid....)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the service here is top notch. We were well taken care of, food came out within a reasonable time, and everything was piping hot. Kudos for finding your groove so quickly after opening.  Many articles that I read prior to my visit led me to believe that the food was inspired by retro American cuisine. While I did see glimpses of this in the menu (Liver and Onions, Wedge Salad, etc), the rest of it was a little all over the place.   We had 4 items in all.  The Brussel Sprouts with Bacon were nice, though not revolutionary.   The Chickpea Fries were my fave of all the items we ordered. Crispy on the outside, and super creamy on the inside. The winner of the night.  The Flatbread with Ranchero Sauce was kind of lame sauce. It felt like a store bought naan that was topped with herbs and grilled. The kicker was that the Ranchero Sauce tasted like bottled Tomato Sauce :I And it was served cold :I Not good.  The Little Havana is the signature sandwich on their menu. It came topped with 3 types of pork: Roast Loin, Pulled Pork, and Bacon, though it felt like the Pulled Pork was missing from ours. The remaining meats were on the dry side unfortunately. Moreover, the portion of refried beans on this sandwich was out of whack. It totally overwhelmed everything. However, I did appreciate the addition of pickled chilis that cut through the richness.  It's only week 1, so I'm sure they're still in the process of tweaking their offerings."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the wife last night. Great little spot on the east side with a solid burger (for me) and a fantastic steak salad (for her). Their coffee is also pretty on point, I feel like this would be a great place to park myself with a book in the afternoon as well. Overall good service and a nice atmosphere makes this for a sure thing in the area. Would definitely recommend for a casual night out or even an easy date. Oh yeah, and the fries are salty but incredible. They come with a nice little mayo dip, which I always tend to prefer over ketchup. We weren't expecting much but this place delivered on an impromptu dinner out."}
{"text":"So this place is fairly new so I understand they may still be fine tuning all the details.  Let's start with the food.  Between my friends and I, we had tried numerous things on the menu.  For appetizers we had the meatballs, poutine and shortribs.  The meatballs and poutine were both average.  The short ribs were tender but overly drenched in sauce, so much so that the meat wasn't as enjoyable.  For the mains we had the mac-n-cheese, the lamb sandwich, the little Havana and the liver & onions.  The lamb sandwich was good but the little Havana was really dry.  Both the mac-n-cheese and the liver & onions were average.  On the side, we had the Brussels sprouts that were disappointingly overcooked.  Finally let's talk abt the decor...I'm not sure if this place is trying to be a pub or a fancy gastropub.  It definitely wasn't the Queen and Beaver but it was better than Hoops.  My real score is 2.5"}
{"text":"Went there for the Super Bowl with a group of people! Staff were great and the food was pretty good. Would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"My significant other and I had the steak, mussels, brussels sprouts with bacon, frites, and salad. Great beer list and a nicely-chosen wine list. Everything was excellent and the service was prompt and friendly - they made us feel like we've been hanging out there for years. Even after we finished eating we watched the other tasty-looking dishes as they were brought out to see what we should try next time. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Without a doubt BEST gastropub food in the city. The mac and cheese is over the top - I've had it 2 nights in a row. The burger - I NEVER order burgers, it is the best. Even if you have always hated brussel sprouts you have to try theirs. That leaves me with the meat balls..... and I am hungry again. I almost forgot the popcorn.... it's a must."}
{"text":"A great addition to Leslieville!  A friend and I had our first brunch at The Brooklyn Tavern today.  The space is lovely and comfortable. The bar is very impressive looking with lots of seats. We both had huevos rancheros - the serving was generous and the food was good. The staff are very warm and welcoming which is great (especially in this town) as we are not regulars.  I will definitely be back soon for drinks at the bar and dinner too."}
{"text":"Brooklyn Tavern is my go-to in Leslieville. So much so that I'm there at least once per week. The food is delicious, consistent, and there are great healthy options. The environment is laid back - the type of place you can go for a one-on-one quiet meal, to watch a game, or for a night out with friends. The servers and owners treat me and my guests like truly valued guests, every time. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a Wednesday evening on my own, sat at the bar in the hopes of striking up a conversation with the staff. Sure enough, the bartender came by and we began by exploring the craft beer menu. A few of the selections are rotating so the offerings change regularly. Cindy turns out to be the proprietor and we chat about how the place came to be and the many other restaurants she has run over the years.  I order the chick pea frites with salsa mole. Interesting almost tofu-like texture beneath the perfectly crispy breading. The salsa was quite warm and complemented my Left Field citrus IPA nicely.  Moving on I consulted with Cindy to arrive at the arctic char for my main. It came served with a Nocoise-esque baby new potato, green bean and cherry tomato salad. The fish was expertly prepared in the crispy skin tradition with sweated onions and fine jullienne orange rind to garnish - perfectly seasoned.  I relaxed following my meal with a Great Lakes Kama-citra and more great conversation.  All in a very good experience. I will definitely be back, probably for brunch. Can't wait to try the divorced poached eggs!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Brooklyn Tavern tonight and the food was outstanding.  There weren't enough servers on tonight but this was rectified as soon as it was evident to the staff.  The space is bright, open and welcoming. Tables are spaced adequately so that you are not intruding on someone else's conversation. If you come alone and wish to eat at the bar, this is an option as well. I did not check out the patio but this is also part of the atmosphere.  Was impressed with both the food servings and the quality of the meals. We had the pork tacos as an appetizer and there was certainly enough for this to be a one person meal. The pulled pork was delicious. Since I was in the mood for the Cuban sandwich, I had that while my dining companion had the fish with the potato salad. We split portions and had the best meal.  Dessert was the creme brule. Fantastic as well.   Will definitely be back. The servers were responsive and attentive. This is a relief to me as I'm tired of having either indifferent servers or those trying out their schtick before their big break."}
{"text":"Plus one on Rachel F.'s assessment of the manager/owner lady. What a weirdo! My friends and I had already eaten dinner and just wanted a few drinks; I guess we were much deceived by the word \"TAVERN\" in this place's name. We asked the server who seated us if it was okay if we ordered drinks only (in their *nearly empty*, post-9PM dining room). A while later the odd lady appeared, hovering awkwardly over us until we stopped talking, and asked if we were ordering food. We explained the situation and without smiling, she awkwardly touched my friend and then drifted away. She reappeared about 15 minutes later to ask, \"You people are ordering food, I HOPE?\" and then stared at us while we blinked in disbelief. Insulted and creeped out, we bluntly asked her if drinks-only was a problem, and if we should settle up and leave. She replied that it was fine, that they are \"open until Midnight!\", and floated away once more. We were wondering if perhaps she sincerely did not remember asking previously, when she appeared a THIRD TIME and asked the identical question about whether we \"had food coming\". We reminded her of the events of the previous hour and she defensively (as if we had gotten inexplicably aggressive) told us \"it's no problem; just hang out!\".  Suffice it to say this is our first and last visit to Brooklyn Definitely-Not-A-Tavern-By-Any-Stretch-Of-The-Imagination."}
{"text":"Went to the Brooklyn Tavern for brunch recently. Firstly, as nice as the server was, she wouldn't allow us to order plain coffee. She tried to convince us to get brunch cocktails, when we said just coffee she said that all they had was lattes, cappuccinos, etc. so we ordered a latte and Americano (both bland). We then saw her walk by us with a lot of coffee for refills at another table.  I ordered the brûlée French toast, first two bites were delicious, but then it gets old fast since it's pretty much bread with half a cm of sugar on both sides... I noticed a slight sour after taste, which I initially thought was due to the bread, I convinced myself that it might be a sourdough bread. I realize now that something was off because I have been feeling sick ever since, and my boyfriend (who had to help me out with the French toast) is feeling the same way.  Being a new place, I had some higher expectations.  I'm also not impressed that we were forced to add an extra $10 to our bill for bad espresso drinks instead of coffee (which had free refills).  The knot in my stomach for last 48 hours have been a solid reminder that I will not be going back to the Brooklyn tavern. Which is a shame because it's so close to home, and was nice (not anymore) to see a new place pop up."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place that we stumbled upon while walking by the area. We had the arugula with roasted beets and goat cheese salad as well as their Sunday black angus brisket pot roast which were both delicious! The service was also excellent. Had a great server that was very attentive :) highly recommended. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We live in the general neighbourhood, and had heard rave reviews of this place for the last year. At the last minute, I called for a reservation, but they were full, so only seats at the bar. As my luck would have it, a larger group did not show, and I got a call back that we could have a table :) WHAT a great, comfortable spot. Dave, co-owner, works the bar. Total sweetheart :) Cindy, his partner and co-owner, works the room, lol. She's SUCH a nice person, and found time to chat with everyone. Service was amazing. Better yet, the FOOD was amazing! It started with a wonderful before-dinner drink... they have a creative menu and drinks are great. Solid wine list, and we tried an incredible wine from Oregon. Horseshoes and Hand Grenades. GREAT wine. Loved the paprika popcorn. Brussel sprout appetizer and French onion soup were both great. My mussels were perfect, and the portion was generous. A bourbon creme brulee finished my night. Wow. This is a real find. Reasonable prices for what you get, a FABULOUS and experienced chef, and wonderful owners. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Most people seem to like the patio but i didn't for two reasons. The walls are way to high.  The main reason i want to eat on a patio is to enjoy the sun and the view with 10 foot walls you have neither. Plus  theres so many vines...there's birds everywhere!! The food was good overall however I don't recommend the onion soup."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends last night and the first time we've visited Brooklyn Tavern.  I really wanted to love this place and the venue itself is nice.  Our server was super friendly and explained the menu items but confused some of us by offering up different combination options.  We started with the Somewhat Crispy Squid in Black Bean Sauce.  Great.  Nice cook on the squid, lightly battered and the sauce was what you'd expect from an Asian Black Bean sauce.  After ordering we were informed that there was only one Little Havana sandwich left.  It was 7:30pm for goodness sake!  It's not like we were late diners.  So one of us had to change our order.  When the mains came up, one person in our party was delivered the wrong soup and had to wait quite a while for the correct soup - (it's soup, why would this take so long?). The fries that accompanied the burger and the sandwich were so salty, they make McDonald's fries taste bland!  Couldn't eat them.  Cuban sandwich was good.  Burger was well liked all around.  Good drinks (Manhattans) and a nice wine list.  We had the Gen5 chardonnay from Lodi California.  There was a large group in the place that made it excessively noisy but the clientèle was a good mix and was pretty representational of the neighbourhood.  Super rude older guy next to us who was using our bench seat as his personal footrest and seemed like a regular.   I may try this place again as I've heard they do a great brunch, but I was a bit underwhelmed with our experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Brooklyn Tavern for a while - and unfortunately I came by when I wasn't too hungry.  The food looked very good! I only had the tortilla soup, which was probably not a great choice for a hot summer afternoon, but still I loved it. The beer selection was pretty good too.   The back patio is really nice. I'll need to come back and update this review."}
{"text":"Service was cold and wait staff indifferent. Brunch was very mediocre. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i came across the Brooklyn Tavern while walking down Queen street East and we decided to have a beer and an appetizer. We had some local IPA's that were recommended by the bartend which were light and tasty. The real winner of the night was the crab cakes. The came in 3 and the textures a as well as tastes were all working in harmony.  I cannot wait for the next time to go here and actually have a full meal!"}
{"text":"Went there for Brunch.  Food was good but nothing exceptional.  Service was lacking. I agree with other reviewers, for a neighborhood bar you'd think they'd be friendlier. I had friendlier service from McD.  First to order but last to be served and part of the order was missed (asked for a well done burger for my kid ...got a medium). I probably wouldn't mind if someone would have come over to explain to me why we were still waiting while the other two tables (one with 2, the other with 2 and a kid) were almost finished their meal before we got ours. After I mentioned it to (I believe) the bartender, then the original server (who I believe was the owner) came by to explain she put all the orders in at the same time but since we were a party of 4 and the others were smaller, and their order was simpler, their food came out first. Just as a FYI, our order was pulled pork grill cheese, burger, flat iron steak, and pull pork salad...  To be fair the owner did comp our meal...  I offer to pay for everything except the burger (2nd attempt still pink inside so my daughter just ate around the edges)...but it was comped.  Probably won't be venturing out that way again..."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood resto. Great selection of appetizers , I wanted everything! Definitely a hit with fellow leslievillers."}
{"text":"This place offered surprisingly better than average brunch!  creative menu items and the food was very good. I had the divorced poached eggs which were tasty and perfectly done.  Dining companion had a decadent grilled cheese that was also great.    only downside was that service was a little harried, but i got the impression that they were either understaffed or busier than usual. would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cozy place in the neighbourhood to have a few drinks, share some apps, and catch up with a friend.  How do I know?  Because that is exactly what I did here! :-)  The atmosphere feels very casual and welcoming and the service staff is attentive and efficient.  We were the only ones sitting out on the patio that day and they constantly came by to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We were in the mood to be chatty so we picked a few apps between us: popcorn with smoked paprika and manchego, chickpea frites, sweet hot chicken sliders, and the fries.  I liked everything that we munched on.  The creme brulee for dessert was a great choice and had that crust you'd expect with the mild custard pudding underneath.  I wasn't impressed with the caesar drink on the menu for the price ($12) but that is a minor issue to what was a overall satisfactory experience at the Brooklyn Tavern."}
{"text":"Very tasteful interior design. Remarkably good brisket burger. Spacious washrooms and back patio round out a fine establishment. A repeat visit for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch options. Great vibe and comfortable seating. Very accommodating, excellent service. Only issue is opening time (11am on Saturday??!). Prices are maybe a buck or two too high and some egg dishes only come with a single egg so you need to add an extra egg, which I thought was a bit chinsy. Overall, great option for killer brunch in the East end. Will have to come back and check out dinner / drink time."}
{"text":"Aside from the few times I crashed here to view a Jays or hockey game over a reliable pint, I had brunch here. Though Leslieville is saturated with weekend brunch options, I hope I don't trigger a Portlandia-style lineup/scene like you'll find virtually every bloody-hell weekend at nearby Lady Marmalade and Bonjour Brioche, when I say the Brooklyn Tavern does better brunch and a better underrated experience than those two places. They have a nice rear patio that beats Bonjour's cramped and faded suburban backyard patio atmosphere. Best of all, no annoying lineups of self-absorbed foodies, hipsters and scenesters clogging and blocking the sidewalk to contend with!  Facing Brooklyn Avenue, the bright and blue and intimate classy design of this gastropub screams of a more mature target clientele where one can have a sophisticated meal while enjoying a game on the bar TVs or amongst family and friends. (There are plenty of older folks in the 'hood who would certainly appreciate a hangout spot like this.) Definitely a decent choice for a group of ladies to hang out for drinks together without feeling like you're in your average grimy bar full of young'uns out to get smashed over loud music, because this isn't one and you won't get that kind of experience here at all--certainly not when there's no average pub food to be had here even. It's a place you can take the family to for a meal, yes--they got high chairs for that at the ready. Regardless, Brooklyn Tavern is open arms to anyone with almost personal-level hospitality-the folks like the proprietors Cindy and Dave are so bubbly here like they're running a B&B or something.  Hmm, brunch.. I had a grilled cheese pulled pork sandwich and it was a mouthful of pulled pork stuffed into a pair of toasty bread. It was good, served with fries and some damn good, damn hot haberero based house sauce. It should be noted that the quinoa/kale/eggs item on the brunch menu is a big-ass salad, and a juicy-looking one at that.  As a bar, this one is a fresh light mature change from the usual heavy-feeling Irish-style or loud hip pub--and there's plenty of those also in Leslieville.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar to Brooklyn/Caroline Avenues.}"}
{"text":"We had brunch here.  I ordered something with eggs, it was really good, the description on the menu didn't do it any justice.  I'm a sucker for avocado, so whatever i got had that on it...it was like eggs benny 2 ways, or something like that.  I also ordered the potato salad.  It was ok.  My hubby doesn't love potato salad so I found the side a bit much to eat all by myself.  If you want to get this make sure your DC will share, like really share!  The decor is nice.  I like the banquet benches.  The window seats are great.  I would come back."}
{"text":"how's this:  $10.00 FOR A DOUBLE AMERICANO.  to break that down that is, $4.50 for a single shot americano, 3.00 for the extra shot, and with tax and a 15% tip on that americano, that comes out to about $10.  That's over 3 times the amount you would pay at any espresso shop in the neighbourhood.  Even Mercury espresso, which is organic charges 2.75 for a double shot americano, large or small.  OFFENSIVE.  I dare you to explain to me how you think it's fair to charge such a price Brooklyn Tavern.  We had a mac and cheese that was good, a huevos rancheros that was really good according to my wife, but the portion was small - compare that to Lady Marmalade on Queen and Logan (waaay better brunch place), which has a hefty portion of the same dish.  I had a brisket burger with cheddar cheese, bacon and fries.  It was recommended to me to have it medium.  I would usually take a steak medium rare.  As I feared it came out slightly dry.  I make much better burgers at home.  And so I will in the future, eat my burgers at home.  Or at least not there.  If not for the americano I'd give this place one more star, but to me that is such a bit of thievery to the customer that I think the 2 stars is generous, considering that I will never come back. It was as if I was given the bill by the waiter who smiled and gave me the finger at the same time.  (this didn't happen, it is just what I felt like.)  I hope the owners read this and make some changes.    Our server, a  young blonde woman (with a 2 year old - she told us) was great and none of this review should reflect upon her."}
{"text":"This is a very cute restaurant. I came here on a Thursday night and it was mainly couples/older people dining here. The walls have very interesting posters. If you walk further in, there is a cute wall full of hangers. I ordered a salmon quinoa salad. Fish was very fresh, the flavours melt in your mouth. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese and strawberry shortcake are the bomb!! They also have a very nice back patio."}
{"text":"This place is cute! The overall feel is great. The music, lighting, and seating arrangements were perfect for the small space. The draft beer selection was good but limited. There were several bottled and canned beers on that he menu as well as an array of liquor and wine. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. The bread was great and the slaw was fantastic. The meat lacked flavor and was a little runny. I'll come back! The steak salad looks good and the staff were so friendly."}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood and was happy to see a new tavern opening.  Simple menu with lots of beer choice.  Special menu for brunch which is available on weekend only.  Highly recommend the grilled skirt steak salad for $12.  A cozy atmosphere that you will love!"}
{"text":"i've eaten here a few times and it's great every time. nice staff, nice restaurant and great food. the brunch menu hits the spot every time, especially the Huevos Rancheros. i can't seem to get away from it.  good restaurant if you're looking for pub-fare and casual dining. looking forward to the spring and sitting in the back patio again."}
{"text":"Worst service I've encountered in a while. Took an hour to get my meal. Other tables were leaving because of how bad the service was. When the food came it wasn't what we ordered but we were so hungry we are it regardless. Food wasn't worth the wait. I am shocked to read good reviews of this place. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Their sunday pot roast is wonderful.    Otherwise the food here consistently leaves me wanting more.   But I still keep going back.   Why?   Well, it's a very safe bet.   You never are going to be too disappointed.  Well, unless you order the calamari.   It's terrible and served in this inedible nasty-sauce.    But they do have a pleasant atmosphere, very little violence and a particularly nice server.     Also, they carry a surprisingly great assortment of Wine.  Which, although almost exclusively new-world, still offers great variety and quality."}
{"text":"Another great Queen East option. One of the best!  Just East of Pape on the south side of Queen, Brooklyn Tavern has an amazing brunch menu. I went Sunday early afternoon with a good friend. I had the Pork Carnitas-Sunchoke Hash with  and my friend had House-Made Gravlax.  First off Sunchokes are awesome in general, and the use in Hash was really good. The Pork Carnitas were also super tasty. I took it with some homemade hot sauce which was legit good and legit hot!  The House-Made Gravlax was also amazing I stole a bit to try and the fingerling potatoes that come with it are done very crispy and just right.  I've also been here for drinks and I can say the atmosphere is great as is the staff. Family can eat here or in general a late 30s+ crowd up to the 70+ crowd. It suits all. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I had the best pork chop of my life here last week, and my hubby's roast was incredible as well!   We've been a few times, and try to every time we're in the area. The service is always so warm and friendly, food is awesome and fast (and made in house!) and the decor is welcoming. Great for large parties or small!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch in the neighbourhood with the bf and thought we'd try out the new Brooklyn Tavern as it looked \"welcoming\". As always, checked online for their menu which consisted of an \"all day\" menu and a brunch menu.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and we were seated right away. The server was super friendly. What we first learned however, was that they were only serving the brunch side of the menu... Don't understand how they could call the other side an \"all day\" menu... And, the server appeared to try quite hard at remembering the order and not writing it down...  We both ordered the steak and eggs with fries ($15 each). I got rare with over easy and he got medium rare with scrambled. I received medium rare with sunny side up and he received medium rare with scrambled. I'm sure they would've fixed their mistake, but I was okay with sunny side up (and I'm pretty sure you couldn't cook that steak any other way...). To my surprise, it did not come with any sort of bread...this is a first for me. So we ordered the side of sourdough bread ($3 for 4 half pieces of toast). It took forever and the nice server kept coming over to explain the long process of heating up and buttering bread. The bread was too toasty.  The ambiance was nice, the servers were friendly, but sadly, the food was just, \"meh.\" I found the sunny side up egg and rather expensive side of toast to be over done. The steak was extra chewy but I wasn't expecting a filet mignon.   Next brunch date - somewhere else, there are many options in the neighbourhood and this one, unfortunately, didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"I go to this place a couple times a month, at least. The service and food are always amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!!! Yummy flatbread appetizer, delicious burger, open face lamb sandwich was fab and awesome butterscotch pudding (we shared and it was a good thing) decadently rich. And terrific service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Brunched on Sunday. Service was meah- server seemed angry and impatient. I had the pork carnita grilled cheese- idea is great! Problem is when biting into it oil literally poured out the bottom. Lost its appeal quickly. Friend had the divorced poached eggs- said they were flavourless Friend had the waffles- advised they tasted like they were frozen.  Sad really- place came highly recommended by friends who had been thought it was great. However- prob won't be going back. Not sure what the big deal Is."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, most recently for brunch on Sunday and I wasn't impressed by the blatant disregard to the customers and lack of professionalism on behalf of the owners.  My roommate and I live up the street and had been meaning to try eating there since their opening about a week ago.  The atmosphere and environment is very straight arrow and the target  clientele was evidently baby-boomer.  We sat at the bar and had a coffee and espresso.  Caught some football and wrestled with the incompetent bartender to get a beer and information with regards to gluten free options and potential brunch wheat beers.  Initially I had asked for a black and blue steak and eggs, I had to repeat it a few times and for a moment I thought I'd have to explain it to the bartender/server.  After a few minutes the chef came out and explained to me that he was serving the steak and eggs with skirt steak and it was advisable to eat it medium.  Any less would yield a tough chewy steak.  I frequently eat skirt steak and have never experienced this issue.  Rather than argue with the chef I ordered something else.  I got the Gravlax, a great easy gluten free option -most of the time. Theirs was three salty slices of salmon served with a creamy potato salad and bland scrambled eggs.  My roommate got the Huevos Rancheros, according to him, they weren't bad, but they weren't anything to write home about neither.  During the course of our meal, the owners and a few of their staff had an impromptu meeting at the end of the bar discussing portions per lb of a product, the cost and the markup.  As a customer, I don't particularly appreciate the profit margin restaurateurs take on a meal flaunted in my face.  Needless to say we aren't too eager to return to this straight arrow older demographic, pricey, average bar/bistro"}
{"text":"Actual rating 3.5.  This restaurant has a lot of potential and I am certain once they work out the kinks, it will be well on its way to a 4/5.  I mean, it is so new that you can still smell the paint!  The serving staff were really nice and made a point of coming over a few times and making sure everything was to our liking.  I did notice though, that twice dishes we didn't order were delivered to our table. They were quickly claimed by neighbouring tables so no big deal, but that tells me the servers are still working out the details of organization. On the plus side, they were totally happy to split the bill though it did take five tries before their credit card machine connected when I went to pay.  Again, kinks and with a little patience, you can forgive them because stuff happens especially when a place is just getting started.  The food we had was hit and miss.  I was most impressed with the eggplant sauce that came with the chickpea fries.  It had a good bite to it and was tangy and fresh tasting. I was least impressed with the flatbread which I found completely generic and yes, the tomato sauce tasted very canned.  The brussel sprouts with bacon were yummy but the Little Havana sandwich didn't float my boat.  Next time, I would try something else.  I imagine over time and with some fine tuning, they will audit their menu and update, then offering their most successful dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! I can't stress enough how great our waitress was, and unfortunately I didn't ask for her name. She has dark brown/black curly hair, she was thorough, attentive and friendly.  We had the Brooklyn Brisket Burger and Cubano Croissant.   Cubano Croissant The croissant was buttery and flakey, the avocado spread was nice and tangy. The pork was flavorful, juicy and not over salted. The runny egg was perfectly cooked. Overall amazing!  Brooklyn Brisket Burger The meat is grind in house and I had it done medium rare. Overall it's tastes great but it's a tad bit salty for my palate. The frites and house made mayo is great and the house made habanero sauce is awesome and hot!  We will definitely be back for more Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Had the Sunday pot roast and it was dead on delish.  The only thing I missed were the pearl onions than my mom used to put in her pot roast.  As always, the service was fabulous.  Everyone there is so friendly and not in a rush for you to eat and get out."}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"dinner and a pint\" place. Very friendly staff, great beers on tap, and absolutely fantastic food.    The burger is the best I've had, ever.  Doesn't even need condiments.  They grind the meat in house, so you can order it medium and get a nice pink middle.  Amazing, juicy, and scrumptious!  Varied and delicious vegetarian options, too."}
{"text":"So rude. So rude.   Came to the Brooklyn Tavern this evening for dinner. The server paid very little to attention to our table, if any. The woman who works/manages(?) the restaurant is an absolute nut. Rude, invasive and very disrespectful. Cam up to our table for what we thought was going to be an apology as to why our food took so long, but instead was a very creepy, \"hello\" before moving on to the next table to do the same. A stranger came to our table to ask for a photo and instead of her offering so we could eat our meal while it was hot, she declined and said \"no\" and instead proceeded to invade the other couples' dinner. Don't you think you would want to let your customer enjoy their hot meal and sit, while you, the owner, or whatever she was, was jabbing away? Rude.  As for our waiter, he couldn't even wait around to get the receipt from the debit machine as we paid, no interest in ensuring everything was okay with our payment, thank us, or anything.   Oh, p.s. the burger is dry as hell."}
{"text":"The food here was very good with the major exception of my hamburger. I ordered it medium and it came well done - dry as hard tack. No juice no flavour. I was offered the chance to get a new one, but then my partner would have finished her meal, so I declined. FWIW, everything else was very good, which is why I only went so low as three stars."}
{"text":"Went to Brooklyn Tavern in the summer. I am a vegetarian and although they had good selections for dinner, there weren't too many healthy veggie lunch items. In saying that, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was really good!! Well cooked and it made me enjoy beans more. Overall, good food, yet nothing too special. :)"}
