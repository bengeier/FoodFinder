{"text":"Went for dinner and the service was horrible. The place was empty and it took close to an hour to get drinks.  Another hour to order and get dinner. The food was average at best and expensive. It took forever to get our bill so that we could leave. Never again..."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here last night with another couple on a Friday evening. We had a 6 P.M. reservation, and were the 2nd table seated. The host initially seated us by the entry way by the kitchen. I asked to be moved more to the middle and edge of the restaurant. 
The food is supposed to be from southern italian. The menu is simple and the prices are fairly reasonable. For appetizers we ordered Prosciutto con melone - prosciutto with melon
 Polpetine fritte con salsa rossa - mini meatballs with marinara sauce, and two orders of Calamari fritte - golden calamari with red onion and lemon. all agreed that their appys were tasty.
Now for the Entree's, one Linguine con gamberi - with prawns, white wine and garlic was ordered, 
 Involtini di manzo - slices of beef rolled with fresh parsley, garlic and mozzarella, cooked in tomato sauce, Pollo alla griglia - a succulent grilled chicken breast with fresh rosemary, and I ordered the Vitello al limone - veal with a saut√©ed white wine and lemon sauce. I would have to say the entree's were a little sparse. I get  the fact that when you go to fine dine, you don't go to \"stuff\" yourself. It's just when they bring out your plate and it looks empty its almost embarassing. My plate had three little pieces of veal the size of  a newborn sock, and 2 mm thick. accompanied by three grilled peppers on top of three grilled zuchinni's. that was it. If I were ever to eat here again, I would stick to eating a pasta entree. That's where you at least get the most bang for your buck. To finish for dessert we ordered tiramisu, and sorbet with a shot of espresso. Oh yeah the meal was accompanied with a couple  of bottles of red wine. All said the total of the evening was $340.00 without tip."}
{"text":"Nothing special.
Calabro is a little Italian restaurant in the industrial area south of the Stampede Grounds/Cemetery Hill.  Perhaps I expected too much, I expected a hole-in-the-wall gem. The restaurant is quite small but comfortably elegant, the menu is quite limited but complete. We went for lunch mid-week.  It was quiet (only a couple of other tables seated) but the service was slow, which meant it was an hour and a half lunch for a single course.  The food was fine; predictable and nothing special.  I had the Gnocchi, good enough but definitely nothing special. Two pasta dishes, two glasses of wine: $50.00. With so many other great places to go to eat and some fantastic Italian restaurants in town, I probably will not go back."}
