{"text":"My husband introduced me to this place when we started dating 10 years ago.  I recommend it to everybody!  Their Montreal smoked meat on rye with spicy mustard is the end all and be all. Great food,  great service."}
{"text":"Great little place here! Great sandwiches! Great service as well, owners very helpful and social, good fun.  I will make a second visit when in the area, for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a Toronto institution. My mom used to get pastrami sandwiches here back in the 70s, and decades later it's where I go for mine. Not sure where I'd go for pastrami sandwiches if it weren't around -- other places just don't measure up!"}
{"text":"Went here recently and got a corned beef sandwich and a pop. I wanted matzahball soup but they unfortunately ran out because of some film crew across the street. The server was sweet and apologetic.  The sandwich was delicious and they were generous with the meat. There's four slices if bread rather than two if you're a fan of splitting your sandwiches into smaller ones, I'm not but it's nice to have. The pops come in fancy glass bottles which is always fun.   Overall it was a good meal. Service was excellent. Decor is interesting. I'll leave my review at 4 stars until I get my soup"}
{"text":"Great deli sandwiches that are easily enough for two."}
{"text":"THE most satisfying sandwich in existence. My wife had the smoked meat and I had the pastrami... wow. Double wow actually.  Uncomplicated, hits all the right buttons, and makes me just plain happy.  Best deli I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Comparable to Schwartz in Montreal. Get the spicy homemade mustard and try Wolfe size."}
{"text":"Cute little deli. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. I love their smoked meat sandwiches. The meat is piled high (as it should be!) between four slices of rye. Service is very friendly. I'm just drooling thinking about the sandwich now!! Yum! If you want a tasty sandwich, go here!!"}
{"text":"My favourite deli; the sandwiches are perfect sized. I go for the Montreal smoke meat. Better than anything I've had in Montreal. Their homemade mustards are delicious. The restaurant itself is a fun nostalgic place. Would you like a coke with that?"}
{"text":"I've just recently ate here. I used to work at a deli and let me tell you it was like home. Super friendly, hot filling sandwiches. I had the corn beef on Kaiser and my boyfriend had the smoke meat on rye with hot mustard. We both enjoyed it. The pickles are Nathan's. Good but I must admit that I am a huge fan of Mrs. Whites. Had the potato salad and it was okay. They told me it wasn't homemade so I didn't expect touch. I'm craving for one as I write. Go in its worth it."}
{"text":"popped in here for a NY Style deli sandwich and recommendations on Yelp.  as soon as you walk in you can tell it's a wonderful family business.  They clearly are popular as they have pictures on the wall with various famous people (including Drake and President Obama!)   they're quite busy during the lunch hour but it's expected. they have seating at the location with a total 80's feel (something I'd see in a movie as I wouldn't know anything about the 80's).   I believe the person who served us was the owner and he was really nice with answering questions (which is the best sandwich, what is the most popular, which one is your favourite)  prepared or super quickly and it came with a generous serving of deli meat, and it was yummmmmmmy!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG Today I went to this 41 yr old tradition for the first time and have to say Y*U*M*M*M* I have the smoked meat with spicy mustard and it melted away in your mouth. This is a must go to place for sure.  Did I say OMG?"}
{"text":"Delicious super buttery soft Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. Tangy vinegar coleslaw. Best place in the area for some good high quality deli. Taking off a star for their slightly high prices ($8.83 approx. for one sandwich) and weird hours (closes at 3pm!?)   I'll definitely be visiting again to try their other meats."}
{"text":"Wolfies Deli is old school perfection on double rye bread. I love their smoked meat and old school corned beef on rye, but feel free to skip all the sides, especially the oven baked french fries. Yes, that's right I said McCain superfries from the toaster oven, LOL The decor is cluttered and tacky with tons of Coca-Cola memorabilia in classic Deli fashion, seating is simple and barely functional, and the sides are all completely forgettable, BUT, you are here for the sandwiches, and they have absolutely gorgeous smoked meat and corned beef sandwiches, shaved thin, overstuffed with a mountain of meat, just completely authentic and delicious and perfect.  There are a few good delis in Toronto, but THIS is the place that truly takes me back to the old Spadina delis of my childhood, getting huge corned beef sandwiches with hot mustard on Fresh rye bread, with my father as a boy. Trust me, you're going to love it."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Food is always great here. David with his signature fedora and Danny are a great team! Went today for lunch with the wife and my son who just returned to Canada from the US. His first meal he wanted after being away for 3 years, was Wolfie's. We got a platter for two with an extra sandwich. Coleslaw was amazing, meat was juicy, rye bread was fresh, potato salad was tasty and the dry karnatzel was delicious too. Not to mention that the pickles are huge! Love that I can get a Vernors Ginger ale there. Even though it seems I should be drinking a coke with the decor there. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I work close by and I've contemplated going in a few times. Today I decided to give it a go. Boy was I happy that I did! It's tiny and decorated in CocaCola paraphernalia. Clean and friendly, a genuine neighbourhood joint. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich-Pastrami. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious! The rye bread was soft and the hot mustard was the perfect accompaniment. A 1/2 sandwich has 4 oz of meat, full sandwich 8 oz and their \"Wolf Size\" has 1 lbs for the ravenously hungry. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"5 stars: great smoked meat sandwich, and they offer it in a combo with slaw. You can also buy smoked meat by the lb to take home.  -1 star: located in a crowded strip plaza with a good chance of finding no parking."}
{"text":"This is a small deli in a small strip mall on Sheppard, serving smoked meat, corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, as well as knishes and a few other things.  It's not much to look at on the outside, and the inside is cluttered and a little dated, but the staff (owners?) are friendly and knowledgeable about what they're serving and the food's good.    If I were up in the area, I might still be inclined to go to Katz' deli, but this is certainly a serviceable alternative."}
{"text":"*Readers beware, biased review based on growing up in the hood!*  I haven't been in recently, so I'm glad there are many other recent reviews to corroborate my memories of consistently delicious deli. The smoked meat sandwiches are off the chart in taste and value - huge portions, hot and juicy freshly sliced meats, soft, fresh bread, and proper grade condiments to complement the sandwiches. I have never tasted a smoked meat sandwich that was better anywhere else. You can get a few other items like knishes (one of my favourites, especially when you get it heated up for you), deli salads, kosher dills, and smoked sausage style meats. They've withstood the test of time for good reason - providing stellar food to the community for decades without frills (except for the memorabilia decor, which doesn't cost you and lends its atmosphere to the deli) and puffed up prices.  It is a small restaurant, only a couple of tables if you wish to eat in. It's more like the classic hole in the wall that produces out of this world food that you pick up when you just want something DELICIOUS. It is true that the plaza in which it's located is a busy one, so finding a parking spot can be a challenge, but it's worth parking a bit further away.  For that matter, it's worth going back \"home\" ASAP! Definitely on my list to return."}
{"text":"Better smoked meat sandwich than Schwartz in Montreal. One of the best I've had no doubt."}
{"text":"I had the smoked meat sandwich and a pineapple pop.  The smoked meat was fresh and tender, as was the rye bread.   So much nicer than the if name place downtown.   I was disappointed though when I went to order a maltzo ball soup and the waitress said they were all out of maltzo balls.   Apparently a film shoot down the road had ordered them all up. I'll have to wait until another time for me to try them.   Good food and friendly service here.    If coming by car parking may be an issue because the restaurant is located in a small strip mall of stores."}
{"text":"Wolfie's Deli is a neighborhood delicatessen that emulates much of what the other delis around town do. The place itself has a bit of history, as evidenced by the photos plastered across the place. They have an old school feel to it, and you'll see it all on display. Ordered a special which was the sandwich, small fries, and potato salad (or coleslaw) for $15.99.   Got the Corned Beef on Kaiser (gf got the Pastrami on Rye). The Corned Beef was good and was wet. The Kaiser is the perfect vessel for these sandwiches as it soaks up much of the flavor. The pastrami was good too, but the rye bread was so dry. They stack two slices which makes it helpful for holding the sandwiches better, but can be a bit overwhelming. Their spicy mustard is legit, so opt for that over the regular mustard everytime. Potato salad was bleh.   Wolfie's is a pretty decent deli. The clientele here appear to be locals and the workers know a bunch by name, which is nice. The place is pretty good, but the prices are a tad high. There are better delis around, and I know they try to be like Montreal's top deli's, but they're just not there yet to me."}
{"text":"Eclectic seating area for family with young children. The portions are very generous, the smoked meat is moist and the Rye bread is delish. Bonus is the homemade hot mustard! Well worth the visit for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"The perfect Jewish deli experience - delicious sandwiches, all the trappings you'd expect. The prices are a little high, but the portions are generous and the service is - well, frankly a lot friendlier than a deli should be. Not sure what to have, just ask and they'll narrow your options down for you to some of the more quintessential options. Think Schwartz's in Montreal without the really obnoxious service."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches! A traditional go to place. Classic with character. Try them out."}
{"text":"Had the Montreal Smoked Meat today. It was fresh with an amazing kick!!! Friendly service. Old time decor. Will definitely be back real soon. Can't wait to try their other hot deli sandwiches. A foodie's delight, BIG TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Danny knows his stuff. When I get that smoke meat urge .....it's worth the drive to Wolfie's. Huge portion.....but so delish I gobble it down to 1 minute. Seriously delicious. They know what they are doing. The fries are good. Beverages are ample but the smoked meat is to truly die for. I always feel like having a little nitrate nap right after but that is truly the sign of a great smoked meat sandwich. Better than Colmans, Yitz's, Caplansky's, Barque's, better than Katz's, better than Pancers......this little hole in the wall beats them all. ok....time to pick my teeth and have a nap."}
{"text":"Terrific corned beef.  A little costly but worth it.  Not too much seating but there is takeout."}
{"text":"I have since received an email from the owner simply stating, \"everyone is entitled to their opinion.\"  Well, Mr. Wolfie, that does not instill much confidence in me to return to your establishment to give you a second try.    Not addressing the server's bare-hand handling of cash and food was particularly classy."}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall deli.  Pastrami is like butter.  Would recommend to anyone looking for Montreal deli in Toronto"}
{"text":"This deli made me so hangry for weeks.  We visited Wolfie's at least three times in hungered desperation for deli meat.. yet it was closed.  All three times.. which, at last, logically led us to check what times this mysterious store was open.  I believe on weekdays it's mostly available from 9am to 3pm, or 5pm on some.  Saturdays close a bit later.. but glaringly closed all Sundays.  Well, you know a deli is good when it could afford to be closed for half the weekend.  When we finally made it there on a Sunday morning, we had the corned beef sandwich, smoked meat sandwich, with coleslaw, potato salad and pickles.  The paper thin deli beef was perfection.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The spicy mustard that went with the rye bread and the beef made the dish all the more salivating and I took home a pound of the corned beef following my meal...... three homemade sandwiches later with Wolfie's meat, I'd still go back for more     I quite liked the friendly man who served us the two times we went.  I also liked the Mickey that stood at the top of the back door of the resto.  The 70's decor was way cool and I wanted to see if the cola bottle machine worked.. (20 cents a bottle?? Really?)    You'll understand the deli's odd hours once you've tried it.  And really, from one very serious meat lover to another, you need to try it"}
{"text":"30 Years of a Classic Deli Wolfie's Delicatessen is a Toronto Landmark.   I can taste the classic style food here.  I had the Smoke Meat on rye with homemade hot mustard. Slaw and shoestring fries.   The meat was piled nice and high. Worth 2 sandwiches. The rye was sliced thin just to hold it together.   The meat was lean, soft and juicy. I polished it off and was looking for more.   They need to add a meat plate option with 3 meats and a pile of rye.  It is always a crowd pleaser and a popular choice in most places that offer it.   The atmosphere here was very cool with the largest coke collection I have seen in a long time. From collector bottles to 50'd and 60's items.   Self serve on the coffee or drinks and grab a friend or a table and enjoy.   The only small disappointment was the foam plates. I hate them in a sit down establishment. I understand it reduces costs, but it doesn't feel as good. Nor does it have the same presentation to the food.   Must have if you are in the area and wanting a Deli sandwich.  You will not be disappointed.   Thanks Wolfie."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this spot that I've had bookmarked for ages and it did not disappoint!   We ordered via ubereats so I can't really comment on the service or the actual restaurant as I haven't actually been inside, so this review is purely about the food.  We ordered two latkes, and the pastrami platter for 2 which comes with a mountain of pastrami, and a heaping scoop of both coleslaw and potato salad and a pickle, this also came with about 6 slices of bread and some packets of mustard. You can order this platter for 1 as well for around $6 less but we opted for the 2 people platter. I have read that the platter for 1 is enough for two people though and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.   The latkes are honestly passable, we were craving latkes when we placed this order but the star was the pastrami. Maybe they would have been better had we dined in but they were just ok. I prefer a thinner, crispy latke but these were thick and dense. Definitely a good portion though for the price, they were massive, a meal in itself actually. Now the pastrami on the other hand was meaty, fatty and succulent but also somehow delicate and there was a depth in flavour that was unexpected. The rye bread was also nice and soft with a chewy crust and worked so nicely with the meat.   Even after a very stuffed sandwich, and the sides, we still had plenty for leftovers and even went and bought another loaf of bread for lunches the next day. The potato salad and coleslaw were also great, I'm not sure if they're homemade but they're above average in taste and a good side to a heavy sandwich.   Overall, this place is awesome, I will be dreaming about it until we order again."}
{"text":"I was hungry and in the neighbourhood. I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and found this place. Holy smokes!! This place serves some SERIOUSLY good corn beef sandwiches. I've never tried a proper corn beef sandwich before, but I think I've found the \"holy grail\" of corn beef sandwiches.  Wolfie's is an unpretentious deli on a typical plaza just like many others, but IMHO it's a best-kept secret you only share with your close friends. The combination of corn beef sandwich + cole slaw + marinated pickle hit the spot. If you're in the neighbourhood, stop reading the reviews on Yelp and go experience their mouthwatering sandwich for yourself.  In terms of cost, the \"Special of the Day\" consisting of sandwich + cole slaw + marinated pickle was $14 + HST and tips.  Side note: Wolfie's has been Drake's favourite neighbourhood spot since he was 5 years old, as his grandmother lived across the street."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich in town! I found the smoked meat on the drier side so at Wolfie's my go-tos are the corned beef and the pastrami.   This is definitely an older style deli which has been around forever. Small place, best for take out.   Be sure to get the house made hot mustard."}
{"text":"Wow what a sandwich! I ordered the smoked meat with their in-house spicy mustard and it worked perfectly. Though a little on the pricier side of things it was worth it once you bit into it. Succulent, juicy and generous. Forget Katz Deli, Wolfies is the way to go fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"After having it bookmarked on my list of places to eat for months, I finally made my way over to Wolfies Deli for their Smoked Meat Sandwich and it did not disappoint. Located in a small unassuming strip plaza, this place is easy to miss but after taking a bite out of their sky high meat sandwiches, never again will I pass by the area without thinking of this Jewish deli.  The Corned Beef, Pastrami and Smoked Meal sandwiches are all priced at $9.96 and sandwiched between four pieces of Silverstein rye with your choice of regular, sweet or hot mustard. The difference between the meats comes down to the spices with the Corned Beef being the simplest (brined beef with no seasoning); Pastrami with a mild blend of seasoning; and the Smoked Meat brined in a mix of peppery spices.  I decided to get the Smoked Meat Sandwich \"special\" ($12.99) which included a sandwich, coleslaw or potato salad, and pickles. The sandwich was absolutely delicious. The smoked meat was freshly sliced from brisket imported from Montreal. The flavour can only be described as meaty and juicy with a buttery soft texture. I was really impressed with the fact that even though the meat was sliced paper thin and fairly lean, I was still able to see all the juices glistening off the surface. The rye bread was soft with a chewy crust which complimented the tender meat and the mustard added a nice kick to the sandwich. Even the sides were great. The Tymek's old fashioned barrel aged dill pickles were crunchy and tart and the potato salad was creamy with a slightly sweet and tangy flavour.  It is easy to see why Drake considers this unpretentious deli one of his favourite neighbourhood spots."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Delicious smoked meat Montreal style. Always juicy.  A great place for families, groups or to meet a friend for lunch or dinner. Take out as well.Want to cater an event-here's a good place to start.  Check the hours-they close at 3 pm on some days."}
