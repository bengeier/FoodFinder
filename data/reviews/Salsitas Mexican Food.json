{"text":"Stopped here this morning. Ordered two breakfast burritos (ham and bacon both with potatoes and cheese). I had the ham and it was very good. My friend had the bacon and also thought it was very good. I live very close by, so I'll be back to try some of their dinner/lunch menu. Friendly woman at the register and I love supporting small local businesses whenever I can. Oh ... loved the green sauce too.

In case you don't know, it's on the west side of Miller Rd between Baseline Rd and Monroe/85. It's a food truck with a permanent structure attached to it for dining outside."}
{"text":"This food is great. I have not had anything that tastes awful here. For a permanent food truck, you can't go wrong, especially with limited choices for quick take out in Buckeye. I have been here several times, and finally needed to review. Today, I realized that not only do they charge an extra .50Â¢ to use a debit card, but they also charge a different price than what is on the posted menu. Today, it was the Chile Verde burrito. $7 on the menu, $8 at the register. The girl at the register told me that all the burritos are $8. Uhmmm... Not on the menu people can see. She said that on the menu in the truck, it's $8. Then change the menu the customers see. The girl ended up making the price right, but I'm still salty for feeling like there is a bait and switch happening. The food is good, there is just some inconsistencies that could hit you in the wallet."}
