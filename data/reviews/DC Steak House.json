{"text":"Celebrated our 1st anniversary and Peter knocked it out out of the park, the food was exceptional as well! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Simply put it was a great meal. I was hesitant to try this place because of the low yelp ratings, but it looked so nice I had to try it. Plus they said they would give my friend a free glass of wine because it was her birthday. Nice wine list (will let you try samples before you buy), attentive service, nice ambiance, tasty salads included in meal and the steak was AWESOME!!!!! Seriously melted in my mouth tender buttery fabulous filet. I hope this place gets busier because it was really good. Great date place for the east valley!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to DC for two years now. I would say we dine here at least once every two months.  We have eaten at many high end steak houses all over in AZ and when traveling and DC tops them all! The cuts of meat are top notch (we always get the filet). I love how everything comes with your order. We usually start with some calamari and our salads, the wasabi ranch is great! We love the toppings that come with the potato and the asparagus is great too and not to forget the mushrooms that come along with it as well.  Since we live in Chandler we love the location and always tell everyone we know to go.  The service is always wonderful and enjoy the atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently spent a week in the Phoenix area. My first night there, I had dinner at the DC Steakhouse.   I ordered my favorite, filet mignon. It just couldn't have been better. I ate there every night after that, until the end of my stay. I was treated as though I was family, and could find no reason to try to find a better meal, service, or value."}
{"text":"Went to DC Steakhouse for the first time on Sunday, June 23rd with my parents.  We had made reservations and were seated right away.  Our waiter, Gavin was extremely friendly and attentive-I'm always thirsty and the poor guy had to refill my drink about 3 times throughout the meal and never had to ask me what I had after the first time.  I ordered the filet mignon with lobster tail and baked potato-I had asked for no mushrooms on top but my meal came with mushrooms.  Not a big deal, I scrapped them off (I'm also pretty sure he gave me a 9oz rather than the 6oz but my dad confused him with his order) so I won't hold it against him.  For dessert I had the key lime pie-delish!  I'd definitely go here again, my dad almost knocked down the partition wall they had setup and they were extremely gracious about it."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  From beginning to end our evening was terrible.  Our server although he was a genuinely nice person is out of his element.  He began by telling us about his favorite Pinot Noir.  How great it was, Russian River, good fruit, etc.  When I saw a different wine that I know is great I said Can we get a bottle of the Cherry Pie Pinot?\"  He seemed baffled and offended that I didn't take his suggestion.  \"Are you sure?, This one is really good and I only have one bottle left.\" he says.  Fine, bring us the one you like.  First rule of dining...never argue with a guest.  He comes back with his wine and it is fine.  No worries, everybody has different taste.    I tell him it is our first time and can he tell us about the menu.  \"Well, appetizers are on the left side of the menu.\"  Really?  That is how you sell your restaurant??  Not ... \"The calamari is very popular, shrimp is great\" etc.  Shouldn't the server be a tour guide to a new guest?    We order a different bottle of wine after we finish the first.  He brings out a fresh glass to taste the second bottle (proper service).  We like this bottle much better, different people like different wine.  He again is perplexed...\"Really, you like this one better?\"  Again, stop being confrontational with the guest.  Here is where it gets good...he then asks \"Do you want to use your old glasses that you used from the first bottle?\"  Um, no I would like fresh glasses so my second wine does not taste like a bunch of different wines.  He says...\"Are you sure? Those are the last three burgundy glasses we have.\"  Again stop arguing with the guest.  If I am having a second bottle of the same wine, then yes same glasses are acceptable.  Different wine = fresh glasses (proper service) As long as it isn't a sippy cup, I would like a fresh glass.  Thank you.    As he is taking our dinner order one of the people at our table spills his wine and our server stops to clean it up.  Perfect.  But before he comes back to us to finish taking our order he stops to take a drink order on a table of 25 that had just arrived.  Who does that?  He finally comes back and we order a 16oz New York, Lamb Chops, and Salmon.  Dinner arrives and we receive a Ribeye, Lamb Chops and Salmon.  Not a big deal, he is buried with the 25 top.  Ribeye is cooked properly.  Salmon is good.  The lamb is two large chops.  They should have been trimmed before service way too much silver skin and fat.  Either way, one of lamb chops arrives medium Rare, one of the chops is Rare.  I was finally able to flag down our server and show him that one is way under-cooked and one is spot on.  \"Can you bring this one lamb chop up to medium rare?\"  This should have been a 1-2 minute process. And he should have left the one chop that was cooked correctly so that I could continue eating with the rest of my party.  A gentleman, I believe to be a manager or owner arrives 6-7 minutes later with my lamb chops.  He sets them down and leaves.  As you would expect 7 minutes = well done.  Lucky for me they over cooked both chops so what was I minor issue of one under-cooked chop now was a ruined meal.  When the server came to clear the plates about 10 minutes he asked how the lamb was and when I told him it was horrible he asked if I would like another order.  Nope not now.  \"Ok\", he says and off he went.  Oblivious to the situation.   Why would I wait another 10 minutes for a fresh order when everyone is finished with their meal.  So they can now watch me eat dinner?  Did the manager come back to check on lamb chops?  Nope.  In fact he never checked on our table at any point in the evening.  Nor any of the surrounding tables.  Horrible, horrible service from the top down.     As I mentioned the server meant well.  Nice guy just poorly trained.  But definitely passionate about his favorite Pinot Noir.  If you are going to charge prices that are similar to Steak 44, City Hall or Maestro's then your food and service better be equally as good.  This restaurant falls short on every level.  Judging from the other reviews I am not alone in my assessment."}
{"text":"For me, DC Steak House is great. Service is very good, owners friendly and accomodating. My favorite is the bone in rib eye, better than Flemings (which I've had). Add a small lobster tail for $11.00. For fish, the walleye is outstanding. Been there many times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Very loud, hard to even carry on a conversation. Pricing similar to that of Donovan's or Ruth's Chris. Food, not even close. The Porterhouse was maybe 1/2\" thick if lucky. Even the ribeye was tough with no marbling. Overall very mediocre. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"My family ate here three times and two out of the trips was horrible and the other was marginal. The service was bad, we never saw our waiter and when we asked him for something he took forever to come back. Everybody except me ordered medium well steaks, I ordered a well done steak and had to send it back three times on every trip. For the price of the steak I ordered I should have been able to get what I wanted.  We decided to write the owner a letter describing our horrific experience and they never wrote back! They didn't care to fix the problem. So we tell everyone of our bad experience and we will never go back."}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed our visits here the food has been delicious and the service has been exceptional. I highly recommend asking for Mandi at the bar, she truly makes the difference with her great service, attitude and recommendations. You can tell she takes pride in her work and it amplifies the experience. I recommend the eggplant fries and grilled wings with the wasabi ranch! They are awesome. This is quickly becoming our favorite spot in downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  We were trying to make a reservation for 8-10 people and they said we needed to confirm in the next few days.  Next day they call and say we have to be done by 8 because they have another reservation then.  Normally 2 hours is fine, but this is a large party and a celebration, so to have a hard stop on a reservation is lame.  Next day they called and said they cancelled our reservation.  This is one way to make sure people do not come to your place.  After reading many reviews, glad we aren't eating here anyway."}
{"text":"They need new staff!! First visit wasn't the best experience with the service being just okay.  We decided to give it a try once more but its the last time we will visit this location.  The staff was more than rude and the service was terrible.  The hostess who greeted us, only after I greeted her sat us near the door and the door was open.  There was a bit of a chill in the air and I asked her if she could shut the door.  Her reply was as if I had insulted her and she stated she would have to ask the manager. The gal that was the bartender that night was the icing on the cake.  She had a terrible attitude and was lacking even a glimpse of a smile.  It seemed as if our party of 6 was a bother to the entire staff that night.  We spent hundreds of dollars on food that night and it was tough for me to even tip due to the terrible service and staff.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here for work on three occasions and #loveit.  Had the filet and ribeye and both were 100% better than The Keg and Ruth's Chris!!!  Appetizers and side are delicious, too.  Very nice environment and vibe, too.  Perfect for a business dinner or romantic evening with your significant other.  Highly recommended!  Can't wait to bring my family here.  Update:  had a family dinner at Fleming's last night to use up a gift card.  I ordered the 16oz prime dry aged ribeye.  It was good; nice and tender.  However, it simply lacked the amazing flavor of the DC 14oz ribeye.  I think DC's put a little more char on the steak and again, DC's ribeye was so much more flavorful.  Fleming's ribeye was $62 while DC's is $29...Fleming's was totally NOT worth the money.  Choose DC's and pay $29 for a steak that tastes like a $62 steak should!"}
{"text":"Not a repeater...the waiter was nice enough but the food was not great especially for the price! Bread is served cold...onion rings are a previously frozen product. The salad is iceberg lettuce I believe the menu says it is a combo of iceberg and romaine. The salads were wilted nothing crisp about them. My husband doesn't eat potatoes...no substitutions are allowed.  So if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable.  Even though they are the same price on the menu  These extra charges increase your bill which is a bummer since everything is a la carte and expensive. We haven't seen the cut of veal they served in over 10 years...and there is a reason why restaurants don't serve that cut any more...it's not great! My steak was ordered medium well...no pink center and charred a little on the outside. It was a  $100 dollar bummer experience....."}
{"text":"This place makes the best steak. Better than The Keg with a lower price. Every time I've gone to eat here, my steak has been perfect. My boyfriend has tried a few things other than steak here and they didn't impress too much but if you're going to a place with \"steakhouse\" in the name, get a steak. Duh!  I love the mushrooms that come with the steak and the salad and baked potato come with your entree. Although I tried the calamari last time I was there and I didn't like it too much. AND the last time I was there they gave our reservation away and we had to wait 15 minutes when we got there.  If you go and get a steak, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The fillet was excellent. My wife's salmon was overcooked, so we returned it.  The next salmon was cooked properly, although I make a better salmon on my grill than what we were served - it was average. Generally, when you send food back that was cooked improperly the restaurant will comp something, but that did not happen. The server also did not mention that to substitute asparagus for the potato is five dollars extra. Otherwise, the server was attentive and friendly. I mentioned to the manager on the way out our experience and instead of offering to make things right he said he wished he had been informed earlier. DC Steakhouse has prices that reflect upscale dining, but is not run to the standards of a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about once every two months. We always sit at the bar or in the bar area, and I have never had a bad meal. We usually order fillets and they are always cooked to perfection.. Tender, juicy and always a wonderful flavor. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had raved about DC to my boyfriend for a very long time, and we decided to go there to celebrate our first anniversary of meeting each other. When I made the reservation by phone, I asked if we could have one of their nicest tables since it was a special occasion. I was told that they could not reserve any particular table, but they would try their best to get us a corner  table by the windows. Two days before our reservation, I was in the area, so I stopped in to double check our reservation in person. I again reiterated the significance of the evening for us. The hostess looked up our reservation right in front of me, and said she would put us down for a corner table. She asked me to point out my three favorite tables, and that she would do her best. She even went so far as to tell me that no other reservation during our time frame was requesting a special table, so that it should not be a problem at all. When we arrived on our special night, I was distressed to see that both corner tables in the front by the windows were already taken, and they had put a \"reserved\" sign on another table for us. It was a table for 4 people, and it was right by the front door. Not exactly romantic. I explained to the woman at the hostess stand what had transpired up to that point. She basically treated me like I must be lying. She said they did not reserve tables for anyone. I told her I had seen the woman on the previous night write the word \"corner\" right on our reservation in their log. She looked it up,and it was no longer there. The people seated at the corner tables had not even had reservations; they had just happened to have the good fortune to come in before we did. I felt it was a terrible way to treat a customer who had taken the time to make a reservation, then even stop by in person to confirm it. Needless to say, we did have a good server. Our food was decent; we both had pricey steaks. We had cocktails and a bottle of wine. We spent a lot of money that night. Our final consensus? We will spend our money at our favorite steak restaurant, Flemings, in the future. They treat us very well, the servers are superb, and the food is definitely superior to DC. It's unfortunate. I will no longer recommend them to others, which is something I used to do on a regular basis. They need to learn how to treat customers with respect."}
{"text":"Super romantic & filet was cooked perfectly.   Loved sweet potato fries.  Used a groupon otherwise would have been pricey.  But it's nice to have a good steak house on east side.  The frank Sinatra music completed the setting.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend and 11yrs. old daughter there last Monday and her comment after she thoroughly enjoyed and inhaled her salad, filet, fries and double chocolate cake- \"This is totally like the complete opposite of McDonald's\" That pretty much sums it up!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance. The lobster and the fillet mignon was delicious.  Classy atmosphere but laid back and casual.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The 5th Star is all about the customer service!  We went here tonight for my boyfriend's birthday.  I got a top sirloin and he got a bone-in ribeye.  My sirloin was spot-on...medium-rare, wonderfully seasoned and I think my face looked like Homer Simpson salivating on each bite; however,....dun, dun, duuunnn....the birthday boy's steak just wasn't turning taste buds.  His steak tasted under-seasoned or too chewy or too, well, regular hunk of meat-ish.  So, when the waiter asked us how our food was I politely spoke up.  Well, actually, I bragged about my steak and then contorted my face when I looked at the plate next to mine.  The waiter was immediately receptive.  BUT!  The saving grace was the manager who came over and was extraordinary in making us \"happy\" and she delivered.  She graciously offered to have a new steak prepared and was apologetic and just did a great job making us feel like valued customers.  If you don't get that from the staff or the manager at DC Steak House, your ability to read everyday social signals is off.  This place is great.  Exactly what I expect for the prices on the menu.  We will recommend you and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and even with it I was disappointed.  Ordered the porterhouse and ribeye.  Both were not grilled well at all.  It was not charred on the outside and almost tasted like it was pan coked - bad grilling job.  And the steak they use is obviously not the fancier cuts.  There were constantly \"chewy\" pieces, indicative of lower quality cuts.  Tasted like Outback Steakhouse, but at least there you are paying less and know it will be bad food.  Bad food, overpriced, cheap quality meat, and poorly cooked."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder if the bad reviews are even for the same restaurant we visited!  Great ambiance.  Nice light jazz music.    Very attentive wait staff and  prompt service.  Crisp, fresh salads (mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, olives, croutons), chicken & ribs well sauced and cooked perfectly.   I upgraded the standard baked potato to the loaded for an extra $2 and the cheese, sour cream, bacon and scallions arrived in a small bowl with plenty for both of our potatoes.  There was only one table empty the entire visit and there was no noise or confusion,  Plenty of room to get between the tables if needed to visit restroom.  We will definitely put DC Steak House on our must visit again list!"}
{"text":"It's been a family tradition to have family celebrations at the D.C. Steakhouse. Heck my hubby proposed marriage 5 years ago here. My favorite is the filet mignon & hubby likes the ribeye. Make reservations, this place gets busy. We always request a round table to enjoy conversation. Beautiful bar, great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went in last night with the wife.  We had great food and service like we always do.   It's nice to see a locally owned places all over downtown."}
{"text":"Great steak, friendly service and good atmosphere! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We just celebrated my son's birthday at DC Chandler and it was absolutely FABULOUS!  We always go to Flemings or the Keg but no more, DC Steakhouse is better.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is out of this world.  The best part is it is a local restaurant!  Our table had the surf and turf, filet, lemon chicken, lamb chops, prime rib and lobster tails....all amazing!  FYI: they do charge a fee if you bring in your own cake, which we learned but that is part of the business and well worth the small fee to enjoy a meal this good!!!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible management and staff.  Went here for dinner one night with some friends and wanted to use a groupon.  While attempting to use the groupon, the waiter and manager argued that the groupon could not be used.  Our friends had been there earlier in the week and had utilized a groupon on that date with no problem.  The manager accused our friends of lying about being in earlier in the week.  Our friends were able to recount exactly where the manager was and what he was doing when they were in the first time.  As a manager, iIt's probably not adviseable to accuse customers of lying, especially when you are wrong. The manager also claimed that he could not accept the groupon because of groupon's rules.  That was an absolute lie as DC Steak House (and all other participating companies determine the rules associated with using groupons at their establishments).  Groupon would have no stake in what rules applied for each restaurant/business/company.  The steak was decent at DC Steak House, but unfortunately, our evening was spoiled.  Please also make sure to check your bill because they like to add extra charges, nickel and diming you anytime they can.  We will not be going back to this restaurant due to our bad experience with the waiter and manager."}
{"text":"After first three visits within two months of this same visit, this would have been 5 stars but the last visit was very disappointing. Four of us all ordered 9 oz. medium rare filets that came out mostly brown without any red. I immediately told the waiter who was quick to agree to take it back to the kitchen. I saw the communication through the window and the cook's first question was, \"do they want it cooked more?\"  Really???  Waiter came back and told us 'it was the light' that made the steaks look more brown. Although it may have been a factor, the steaks were over cooked.  Waiter never said a thing again even though we twice mentioned the steaks were not cooked correctly. No offer to take anything off our bill and no apology if anything did not meet our expectations. As a former Wisconsin resident, and knowing the owners are also from there, this is not how Wisconsinites run a supper club!!  I can no longer recommend your business. Sorry."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time last night. We had a party of five and made reservations for Christmas family dinner. When we arrived they sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant. One member of our party actually had to sit in the aisle way. As we sat down I noticed they sat at a table of five who just walked in off the street at a nice cozy corner table for 6. This did alter my view of the restaurant for I wanted a nice Christmas dinner for my family with good food and good conversation.  Our waitress approached the table she seemed very nice and had a desire to service as well.  Unfortunately she did not seem to have adequate training to achieve this goal. She try hard throughout the night to services but nothing seems to go right example we asked her about bread she said well sometimes the kitchen has it and sometimes it doesn't it just happens that way. I thought this was an unacceptable answer. (They could have sent someone to the Walmart just 1/2 mile away bought bread heated it up and served it, it would have benn better than no bread)  Once ordering dinner it was served in a timely manner however our poor waitress continued to reach over diners to place plates in front of other diner. At  this point I really started feeling sorry for her she's stranded on an island on her own. Trying to do a good job but not sure how.  We thought the quality of the meals meet the price. All the steaks came out cook as requested and there were no major concerns over any of the meal.  Overall it appears to me that this restaurant wants to compete with the upper end steakhouses. The quality of their food achieve this goal.  for which I give them two stars. The quality of their servers only receive one star because even though they try hard they do not seem to have the tools to succeed. I give management 0 stars because I feel they have been delinquent in training their staff. Throughout the two and a half hours we spent there for dinner I constantly scan the restaurant to see who was in charge. I could not find anyone who seem to know what was going on in the entire restaurant. No one address our table ask if the meal was good or if the food wad prepared properly. I felt at a restaurant like this this was a huge faux pas.  As we left the restaurant two very nice employees wish us a happy holidays, which I thought was great, unfortunately they were standing right outside the exit on their smoke breaks which really makes me question management at this location.  I wish this steakhouse the best of luck, however I will not be returning with my family"}
{"text":"Our reservation was for 6 o'clock and it's now almost 6:30 and they still have not seated us. There are seats open and available and nothing has been done to accommodate our party. So far the staff has been very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The atmosphere is quaint and the food is excellent! My favorite date night spot in Chandler."}
{"text":"omg amazing restaurant loved the service and the manager.  I will be making this a regukar stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I were extremely disappointed with our meals at DC Steak House. The salads provided with the meals were mostly white iceberg lettuce with a few greens for color. Even the two olives in the salad had NO flavor. Our steaks were perfectly cooked medium rare but my NY Strip was quite chewy and my wife's Ribeye had a layer of gristle running through it. The accompanying mushrooms were straight from a can. I ordered the stuffed baked potato for $2.  The shredded cheese was straight from a bag and the chives were the tops of green onions. Someone in the kitchen must know there is a difference. The whipped cream for the dessert was straight from a can. Our bill was $130 plus tip. Never again. Even Outback is a better value."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Great atmosphere in the heart of chandler. The owners are very friendly and always make sure that everything is perfect. The staff is awesome!  I would highly recommend that if you haven't tried this place yet then you need to."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! From the front door to the exit, this family does quality food and service the right way!"}
{"text":"Best Steak house West of the Mississippi (and beyond).  I have eaten here 10+ times and truly appreciate the food, the service and the owners.  They have gone over and beyond to make sure we have a fantastic dinner every time. The Filet is amazing and the mushrooms are the best I have had."}
{"text":"First time at dc steak house.  Nice place. Little loud but not bad.  Had a acoustic guy tonight.  Sounded good.  Very good wait staff.  I felt not over priced.  Great steak.  Over all good experience.   I recommend a nite out with the wife there. Cheers...."}
{"text":"Went to DC Steakhouse  on Valentine's  Day. The waiter left a little to be desired. I received  a house  salad and some  of  the  lettuce  was brown. I mentioned  that  to the  waiter. His response  was  he had  no  idea other  than  the staff chops  it at 3PM. Told me he would  mention  it. Asked for  a 2nd serving of Blue Cheese Dressing never brought it.The server brought  bread to the  table just before serving dinner  and only  after  I  asked for it. I ordered the  top sirloin steak and it was tuff and mushie when  you  chewed it.The baked potato  was not  fresh it had been  around  awhile perhaps  since lunch. For the price it was not good.   I would  not return Elaine"}
{"text":"In short, a nice meal with friendly wait service.  Ask what \"medium rare\" means to them before placing your order you may be surprised!  Oh and don't eat at the bar! Seeing your dinner sit on the warming table for 8 minutes may make you anxious."}
{"text":"Great server.  Great Food.  Steak and chicken very good and juicy. Had the Filet Mignon and also had this Lemon Chicken with pasta very Delicious. Was the most juicy and tender chicken breast I ever had. I recommend this place to any in town."}
{"text":"Nice dinner with friends. Everyone had something different - lobster to swordfish; ribeye and ribs and each raved. Very competent service. Yes; on Friday night it is busy and loud but that is how it should be at a good place!"}
{"text":"The.Best.Desert.Ever! Chocolate layered cake with salted caramel sauce!! Great service, food and atmosphere! I will return for more!"}
{"text":"The decision to stop into DC Steakhouse today was one that was reached with quite a fair share of reluctance.  As far as AZ Steakhouses go, it's probably nowhere near the top 20, and neither me or my family had ever heard any sort of positive word of mouth about the establishment.  For all intense and purpose, we really only went in because somebody had gifted us a Gift Certificate, and since it was one of those places that charged about $27 on average for a cut of meat, it just had to be delicious right?!  Wrong.  One of the biggest problems with \"DC\" has to be the service.  The waiter immediately greeted us with an air of extreme arrogance about him.  Not only did he lack the knowledge or communication skills necessary to be the sophisticated maitre d' that he imagined himself to be in his own mind, but his inflated ego gave off the impression that we should be flattered just to be allowed both on the premises, and even more so in his presence.  It's a lot like those bits that a lot of Stand Up Comics do about the service in France, but right here in our own back yard!  Every time we were approached at our table, he would immediately interject himself into our conversations, and any questions we may have had regarding the menu, were immediately met with 5 minutes of speech on unrelated menu items in fractured English.  My meal started with an order of Fried Mozzarella.  The breading itself wasn't too bad, and though the sticks themselves were a little on the soggy side, they at least were plentiful as one order meant a dozen sticks.  For my drink I ordered an Iced Tea, and though it's really hard to mess up an Iced Tea, it even harder for me to enjoy it when the rubbish in my glass tastes more like watered down Brisk than anything else.  For my entree I chose to go with the 9oz New York Strip (Medium) which would prove to be one of the worse decisions of the night, trumped only by the decision to visit this establishment.  When I finally muscled a piece of the steak into my mouth, I was instantly displeased.  The texture was extremely tough, and the steak itself should have come with a hacksaw rather than a steak knife.  The rub they use on their meat was fairly good, but after you got past that top layer, you were left with a good inch or bland flavorless cardboard.  Though I am aware that the South West is a place renowned for it's droughts, I had never in my wildest dreams would have thought this drought would translate even to the steak I eat, as it was the driest piece of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of consuming.  I've cooked budget priced steak on a stove-top that tasted better than this, and the fact that I utterly fail at cooking steaks, speaks volumes as to the quality of this overpriced trash.  As a side I ordered the baked potato.  As I tend to like a lot of the fixings with my potato, I chose to take the $2 upgrade and turn mine into a \"loaded\" baked potato.  Apparently in this restaurant, \"loaded\" just means that they give you a small dipping bowl on the side with the cheese, sour cream, and a few other things in it.  Apparently not only was I supposed to overpay them for my meal, but I was also supposed to prep the food myself!  When we collected our check, we were never asked our opinion of the food, and in fact the waiter seemed to sneer at me when I pushed away the idea of taking any of this food home with me.  Many other reviewers here have mentioned that you can get a better steak at Outback or Black Angus, and I would also second this notion.  Heck, you could probably get a better steak from Golden Coral.    If you are giving a thought to eating here, I would advise you to take your hard earned dollars elsewhere, there are plenty of better mannered quality establishments even within the same complex.  If by chance somebody offloaded a Gift Card on you, I would instead stay home and burn it in your fireplace while smashing your shins in with a two by four, as this would likely be a more enjoyable use of your time."}
{"text":"We were excited to see a new addition to downtown Chandler and eager to give this place a try. After being seated promptly on a slow Tuesday night, we were given water and bread, then ignored for at least 15 minutes. Our waitress was not to be seen and the other waiters didn't make an effort to check on us or offer to take even our drink orders. We ended up walking out and enjoying a lovely dinner around the corner at Latitude 8."}
{"text":"The service was decent.. the waiter was nice, so was the wine.  Me and my boyfriend both ordered porterhouses and they were bland and desperately underseasoned.  We also both got mashed potatoes on the side (which was a $2 upcharge!!) and they were BOXED.. yes, BOXED. I honestly wanted to like this place since it is convenient and we've been looking for a local steakhouse.. sadly, this is not the one."}
{"text":"Disappointed, will not return. Ambiance is blah, one large open room with table and chairs and a bar in the rear. Service is lack luster. My salad was pathetic looking plate of greens. The lamb chop was ordered medium (which means not rare) but alas it was quire rare in the center. To top off the bad experience was the price!  Chop on Queen Creek is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small. Service was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change..."}
{"text":"Visited here for a second time since I had a Groupon. The menu is very basic, and while I have no complaints about the food, it was just ok. There are other restaurants that offer a much better value for the same price of their steak dinners. Since I only paid $25 for a$50 voucher, I was pleased with my experience, and would visit again only if I had another coupon or voucher."}
{"text":"Ok.... I'm in Chandler, AZ for one night.... Corey at the front desk of my hotel tells me to go to downtown Chandler and try DC Steak House.   The restaurant is right in downtown Chandler and very easy to find.  I sat at the bar and Mike the bartender was GREAT!!!!  Basically, I spent an hour with Mike and the manager of DC's talking about sports and sports trivia with me and another customer at the bar.   The manager of DC's had some good sports trivia questions and was equally as nice as Mike.  Food.. Great Ribeye... Great sides!!! Awesome carrot cake!  Service .....Mike is \"The Man\" behind the bar.  Keep up the good work!!!   I'll be back to DC Steak House!"}
{"text":"Solid meal every time we have dined there. Cool speakeasy type atmosphere with rat pack style music! Service is always stellar and food consistently good! Double pork chops are my favorite! Get one crusted with blue cheese!!! Omg!  Great local spot!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we all were satisfied. My son and I had the New York strips which were cooked perfect and very delicious. My wife had the salmon and it was unbelievable. My daughter said the chicken sandwich she had was the best she had ever had.  The waitress was very attentive without being interruptive and in your face. To top off the evening, the dessert was to die for.  If I had to find something wrong it was that when we arrived, the background music was too loud but as more and more people came in it leveled off.  All in all it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I never write reviews unless something is so amazing I couldn't believe it, or so terrible I couldn't believe it. This review will be the later, and I apologize because it's going to be lengthy.   We rarely, and I mean rarely, go out to eat, but I had heard such great reviews for DC Steak House so I figured... why not? Let me tell you why not. We make our \"necessary reservations\" which takes me three times to get through because I am not comfortable just \"leaving a message\" and assuming it was listened to (not very professional). We get there at our designated time, and the place is practically empty (ok... so we needed reservations why? People were just walking in and sitting down!). The hostess was wearing a see through top that one would wear to a club, shorty shorts, and a boyfriend cartigan and gladiator sandals(how does this scream \"upscale\"???)  Our waitress was extremely nice, and one reason I feel bad for writing a negative review because she was pleasant... however, after we got our appetizers, things just went downhill. After about 50 minutes, we noticed the people that had come in after us were not only getting their food, but had finished their dinner and were paying before our waitress FINALLY came over and apologized for \"putting our order in AFTER her party of 6\". Fine. We patiently wait for our food, and once it arrives, we both thanked the heavenly God's because we were starving.  My boyfriend despises a lot of red/pink, but he doesn't mind a little, so he ordered medium-well. I love red/pink, so I ordered medium-rare. He got what is typically a medium-rare steak (some cooked, some red/pink, perfection!) and mine was so rare I could have rolled it up, smashed it down, and threw it on the grill for a nice steak burger. Disgusting. The mushrooms, which I would have typically loved, were so slimy I took one bite and actually started gagging at the table. I had to look for the bathroom in case I were to actually get sick (this has NEVER happened to me).  Needless to say, I was not even going to attempt to eat anything else the rest of the night. So the waitress comes back, asks how everything is, and we explain the dilemma of the wrongly-cooked steaks. She apologizes and takes mine back to be cooked more and bagged (since I only took 2 bites of my 9 oz filet mignon... I was not about to waste my money). She brings my box over and my boyfriend asks for the manager. The Manager was a JOKE. I am a young female in business (management), so it pains me to say this, but she was extremely unprofessional, and I am shocked anyone would trust her to take care of \"complaints.\" She kept tilting her head from side to side, blinking constantly, and would stare off into the distance rather than looking at us directly. She would ask questions that made it seem like WE were in the wrong (like: \"what size steak did you get? oh, yes, that is a thick steak, so medium-well will be less rare....\" as if we know your cooks don't know to leave thicker steaks on for longer... OUR BAD). She attempted 3 times to give us a free dessert (which neither one of us wanted), and once my boyfriend said \"we probably will not be back\" she disengages and says \"that's too bad\" and walks off. Color me silly, but wouldn't a professional manager do something other than shrug and walk off one that is said? YOU DON'T LET MONEY WALK OUT OF THE DOOR!!!!!!!!!!! She did comp our appetizer (again our complaint was against our $30 steaks, not our $4 appetizer) which was nice, but seriously ridiculous.  I don't know when these people with great reviews are going, but it is CLEARLY not when this \"D-squad\" staff is there. I would NEVER go back. From the other posts I've read on here, I'd say it's safe to avoid if possible. I've also noticed the manager or gm does not respond to any posts on here... they need to get their head out of the sand and read these reviews and FIX their problems."}
{"text":"We wanted to try DCSteakhouse for a while now, and one night craving steak made it happen. Well, we were excited to see all those ratings, raving about the food, or the service, or whatever anyone can find \"good\" at that place. The hostess was nice, she told us a table would be ready shortly; we are more than ok with that, and having a drink at the bar sounded good before moving to a table for dinner. No service at the bar, overwhelmed bartender, who just had time to say \"i'll be right with you\" and then.... nothing. We was never right with us. We sat down and waited. Our server, very busy as well, was empty, no charisma, no personality, an order taker, not a server. Drinks were finally ordered, and brought way too long after. Ordered food, salad was very impersonal, plastic bag lettuce with canned olives, commercial dressing, and tasteless tomatoes. Now the steak. 22 oz Ribeye for me, and \"Surf and Turf\" for my loving wife. Walmart quality steaks, not correctly cooked, tasteless again. What was tasteful was the portion of fries. Too bad they tasted like calamari. Told the waitress, she was defensive and swore it could not be possible, and asked \"what do you want me to do?\". Well, tell the guy in the ktchen, try my fries, listen to what I have to say since I just ate some of them.... I don't know, there are plenty of things you can do. Instead of fighting, we decided to try dessert, to rince off the taste of calamari fries. Once again, supermarket dessert, with canned whipped cream. Mediocrity at its best, we were happily surprised with the crowd. It is a busy restaurant, so they must do something right. We just could not find what it was."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The service is superior and their steaks are awesome!  The restaurant itself is a bit  noisy and a bit crowded due to it's size."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant a while back for mother's day dinner with hubby and my 3 year old son. Made a 7 PM reservation and arrive on time but have to wait for another 15 min since they were busy. After we sat down and order, the food surprisingly didn't take long to arrive considering that they were busy. Hubby got fillet mignon medium rare and I got the ribeye steak medium well; both cooked perfectly but we both agree that it needed more salt. The place was a little too dark to read the menu but overall it has a nice ambiance. Will be back again for date nights one of these days for sure."}
{"text":"We visited the DC Steak House on a Friday night. There were 4 of us. We were tucked in the back corner of the restaurant, which was fine because it was less noisy there.  The food is amazing and the cocktails totally rock! I can't stop thinking about the Lemon Meringue pie martini. Wow!! Everything we had was amazing. I loved the calamari and my filet was 'like butter'! So good. I deducted one star because the waitress was less than nice and really rushed us. She had terrible customer service skills and we did not feel welcome or appreciated at all. I would categorize her service style as cordial impatience. Our bill came to $400 so you would think she could have been nice. I guess she had somewhere to be because she left before we did. When a server blows out your candle at your table, I guess that means it is time to go.  Incidentally, the manager (could be the owner?) would take breaks outside the side door next to the table where he sat. He would smoke and drink out there in our view and by the look on his face when he took a sip of the carmel colored liquid on ice, it was NOT cola. I thought that was kind of tacky especially when he walked back in the restaurant past our table stinking like smoke. Would I go back? Perhaps but they really need some image/customer service training."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night.  We had 7:45 reservations.  It was packed when we got there but we were seated immediately at a nice table for two. The atmosphere was cool. It is dimly lit with candles.  The place is on the smaller side and noisy but that was fine with me.    Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  I ordered a speciality martini... Otter Pop. it was very strong but very good. The salad that comes with the meal is sufficient and tasted good. I had the 5 oz. filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly medium rare and tasted amazing. I like that they serve a 5 oz filet because I was able to eat it all.  You get one side with the meal and the sweet potato fries were yummy. It was a great meal and a good experience.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I never leave reviews for bad service/food, but this place made my blood boil.  On Wednesday, my husband and I took my family out to dinner here (5 people total). For an appetizer we had calamari; it was pretty good. My dad ordered the steak/lobster combo (lg), my brother ordered steak/shrimp, my mom ordered the small steak/lobster, I ordered the 8 oz. fillet, and my husband ordered the NY strip.   Salads were so-so; Lettuce and two chunks of under ripe tomatoes and an olive. When the main dishes came out everything looked pretty good. Not amazing, but good - better quality than a chain. My parents and brother said everything looked/tasted good, mine was fine as well (though pretty bland). Then I look over at my husband's plate and see him trying to cut into a tough, GREY piece of meat (he ordered medium-rare). My husband asked me if he should send it back and before doing so, cut through the middle to make sure it wasn't just a little overdone on the ends; it was grey and stringy even all the way through (the fat had not been rendered either so there was this huge side of gristle).   When the waiter came over again my husband politely mentioned that the meat is not medium rare and the waiter (without apologizing) says he will get them to make another one. A few minutes later he comes back and asks my husband if he was \"sure\" that the steak was not cooked medium-rare. My husband said it was not medium-rare AGAIN and so the waiter said he would get them to make another, which they should have done the first time. a few minutes after that, a female (who may have been the manager) came to the table and asked my husband to come with her to look at the steak! She told him it was 'just the light' and he came back not wanting to argue anymore. When he came back to the table my family he was so embarrassed because the treated him like a child and NOT a customer! At this point, I was livid and called the waiter back over myself - I cut into the steak and showed him the inside; again no apology, just said \"okay\" and took it away. My mom spoke up and said that it was rude for them to pull my husband into the kitchen and he said nothing. When they came back with the new steak it was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than the first and still blah AT BEST! You could tell it was rarer, but the meat was still tough as all heck and looked like it had been frozen and microwaved. We cook NY strips at home all the time and I have NEVER seen one look like that before. DISGUSTING! Mind you I have returned food maybe three times in my life when there was not hair or other foreign objects in it and my husband has even less than that.   I have never encountered such ridiculous service at a restaurant and they STILL CHARGED US for his meall! The bill was around $240 after all this mess. All that said, I still left a decent tip because the rest of my family enjoyed their food but after thinking about it over the last few days I really wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"we wanted to make reservations, but that's done by the answering machine. We did however have reservations when we arrived. One good thing.  The ad said half-price drinks, wine and appetizers during happy hour, which is 4 to 6. We arrived at 5:15 and were met by a very gracious hostess. We informed her we were going to the bar to partake of the happy hour specials and for her to  find us at six o'clock for our table to which she agreed. We ordered a bloody Mary and a glass of white wine, the crab cocktail and an order of hot wings. 25 minutes later we received our appetizers. I was unable to eat the wings. They were like rubber. The bartender did remove the eight dollars from the bill for the eight wings. The rest of it came to $30.92 with tax. I was informed at that point by the bartender that none of the items ordered were included in the happy hour prices. Upon entering I asked the hostess if we could transfer our bar tab to our dining tab. She informed we could. The bartender informed us we can only transfer our drink costs to the dining room. Our server was outstanding. He brought water and warm bread with butter immediately. We each ordered the 14 ounce ribeye rare with baked potato. I was unable to cut the bottom of my potato skin with a steak knife, it was so hard. The potatoes were wrapped in foil which steams the potato. I don't care for that, some people do. The steak had a good flavor but a great deal of fat and grizzle.I enjoy it with the three small button mushrooms. Upon leaving, I attempted to voice my concerns with the hostess. She was completely uninterested.  I am a retired chef of many years. Included in several of those years I was president of the restaurant chain that covered the whole US. Although they were busy, I can't imagine why. We will never return and of course, let our friends know what we thought it. The Chandler area must be desperate for dinner houses."}
{"text":"I went to try this steak house restaurant last night for the first time, and here is how i was treated: 1) At first they made me choose between sitting on a small table at the patio right at the entrance where there is a huge traffic or share a high-top table at the bar. I choose the latter. Although there were more than 5 or 6 empty tables in the main dining area. Anyway this wasn't a really big deal. 2) I ordered lamb chops (double) and I told them I want them medium cooked. By the definition on their menu, medium is \"Hot center, pink throughout\". I was really excited to have my lamb chops especially I was craving them the entire week. Unfortunately, I got my chops very red and very very cold in the center. I told the server to take my two chops back and have them cooked to where the center is warm. To my surprise they sent me back two chops that were a) well done, no pink. b) HALF the size of the original chops. Literally, they were have the size of the original lamb chops or even less!!!! At that point I didn't even bother to complain, I ate the skinny fries and the three small mushrooms and left the chops untouched excepted for the first bite.  Unfortunately, after leaving the restaurant I realized that the only thing I enjoyed having was the drinks and the salad, both they had very little to do with.  I REALLY wanted to have a good experience at this place since it's close to my house."}
{"text":"Decent Food....Crappy Service  Before I ever read any reviews on this place, a number of friends & family had the same opinion, decent food...terrible service. I know experiences and opinions are unique so in all fairness, I thought we'd give it a try for our anniversary.  We arrived for our reservation on time and were seated at a small \"2-top\" table against the wall. This table was SMALL, add to that it was pushed against the wall and with my back up against the bus boy station. Just a bad spot for a table. We grabbed a well-dressed gentleman, I assume was the General Manager and asked if we can be moved. We were denied our small request with his flippant \"sorry can't help you\" attitude.  Surprisingly when we asked our waiter just a few minutes later if we could be moved, it was not a problem! Wow.  This of course put a bad taste in our mouth right at the beginning. Luckily, our waiter was excellent, was attentive and provided great service. Throughout the dinner I noticed the GM stopping at each table, asking how everything was. Not surprisingly, he must have forgotten our table that evening. Personally, if my own wait staff made me look like a tool, I'd be embarrassed too!  Food was decent, but you can get the same steak, for the same price at any number of the steak places in the valley, minus the crappy service. When you have the General Manager refuse a customer such a small request to accommodate someone and act like he's doing you a favor by letting you dine there, I'm going somewhere else...and telling my friends to go somewhere else.  I hope the Owners address this....Good Luck."}
{"text":"Well...After reading the other reviews we decided to give DC a shot for Valentine's Weekend.  Not a good idea.  Once again they were not prepared for the crowd.  We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of \"Hells Kitchen\".    We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...  All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing...\"sorry we are still learning\"...\"thanks for your patience\"...\"It's been overwhelming\" told to us by our server...  It's really too bad, nice place, nice people, my steak was perfect and I love the fact that they serve every steak with sauteed mushrooms...love em, and the price point of the menu is right on...Wine list could be better especially for a \"Steakhouse\" they are competing with some heavy hitters in the Southeast Valley, they better step it up a bit...  Crazy thing is everyone wanted to go back to give them another try when they aren't busy, go figure...not sure I will."}
{"text":"Best happy hour special is the open faced tenderloin sandwich!!! Great steaks!!! (...and service too when they're not too busy!) Their Wasabi Ranch salad dressing is tasty! I highly recommend making reservations on the weekend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there using the Groupon mentioned by others. It was a gift she gave me for father's Day. She wanted to try it based on favorable recommendations from her friends. We went there tonight (July 3). We called ahead for seating and when we showed up early we were seated right away in a cozy corner in the rear. We had a nice view out the side street window and enjoyed watching the first haboob of the season blow through. The atmosphere was very inviting and the overall appearance well decorated. My wife thought the lighting was a little dim, which only got worse when the haboob rolled in. Eventually they did brighten the lights.   Jeffrey was our waiter and was very helpful and pleasant. We ordered Steve's Shrimp Cocktail for an appetizer. The only difference between that and the regular shrimp cocktail is that the shrimp are grilled instead of chilled. Having said that, the dish (either one) is simply 4 shrimp plus no frills cocktail sauce and a lemon wedge. The presentation seemed sparse. The shrimp were very large and you can order more at $4 each. I'm glad we're tried the grilled shrimp because the seasonings were very tasty but once you get past the seasonings and taste just the shrimp itself, there wasn't much flavor, and that was how the rest of the meal went. My wife ordered the grilled swordfish with loaded baked potato, and I the boneless  ribeye cooked medium well with thin French fries. I chose not to order a side of sautéed mushrooms because the menu says they come with all steaks. My steak came with 3 small mushrooms. On a 14 oz steak I'm not sure that qualifies as more than a garnish. Medium well was a little redder than I would have preferred but I chose not to send it back. The flavor was just okay, which was disappointing for the price. My wife tried it and she thought it was tasty. The thin French fries were excellent. My wife wasn't impressed with her swordfish but I thought it was tasty. She did like the baked potato. In addition to a potato, a salad is included and is served with bread after the appetizer and before the entree. We weren't aware of that so my wife asked for bread which was delivered promptly. On my salad I went for the wasabi dressing which was milder than I was anticipating. The salad did include a pepper which made up for the lack of spice I was expecting in the dressing. My wife doesn't like as much spice so I asked her to giver her opinion and she thought the dressing was fine for her palette. For dessert we ordered the cream puff with sea salt caramel glaze a la mode to share. The ice cream was good, the pastry rather plain. My wife and I agreed on that. This came from a local bakery as the only dessert this restaurant makes in house is tiramisu.   As a point of reference, we like the Keg Steakhouse. The prices and service are comparable but the taste definitely is not. We won't return to DC Steak House."}
{"text":"Dined for the first time last night. Could be possibly one if the better steakhouses in AZ! Ordered Surf n Turf at market price..$78!! Little over priced for the quality if you ask me. For those who don't know its Lobster Tail and Filet Steak). My girl ordered Prime Rib (only available on Sat). Moist, tender and delicious. Amber our waitress was super attentive and kept asking \"more drinks, more drinks.?\" Spoke with co-owner Laurie to let her know we loved the Wisconsin cheese curds (need more cheese though if you're gonna claim Wisconsin style :)  Side bar..building built in 1915 so if you need to use one of the two restrooms (one toilet per gender) there will ALWAYS be a wait due to lack of industrial plumbing opportunities for this old ass, Saloon looking place. Where are the horses and carriages??  All in all..great dining experience. We'll be back, minus market prices.  Salute!"}
{"text":"So let's start by putting DC Steak House into perspective relative to their price: Due to the pricing of their plates DC Steak House is competing with Flemming's, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, City Hall and even The Keg.   Upon entering the establishment we were warmly greeted, quickly seated and the waiter was on top of taking our drink order. However it was a bit unusual that the waiter never went over the menu, never asked if we had any questions or made any type of presentation. He simply just kept checking with us until we were prepared to tell him what we wanted.   We decided to order calamari (as the appetizer) two Filet Mignon's, a loaded baked potato, steak fries and asparagus for an extra side. The calamari was slow to come out of the kitchen but was pretty good - I've had better, I've had a lot worse. Next up were the Filets (which took even longer to serve) that had a perfect grill mark presentation. Our sides appeared to be thrown on the plate and the \"loaded\" baked potato is a plain potato, still wrapped in foil, that you must finish preparing yourself.   The steak was decent tasting and they use a very high quality cut. After I made my own loaded baked potato, and removed the foil, I realized the skin wasn't even salted, grilled or.... made that appealing. Our asparagus was over salted and... well ... I just wasn't very impressed with anything thus far.  As a matter of fact - If I had tasted these steaks VS. ....dare I say .... Outback that Outback would come out ahead in the flavor category (even though they don't use a high quality cut) and it's 1/3 the cost. When you start comparing the other restaurants mentioned DC Steak House can not compete in any category (Food, Service, Decor, Drinks, Bar...)   Summary: If you want the best or need to impress then go to any other steak house mentioned in my first paragraph. If you want to eat here to say you've experienced it - then go for it. It's not bad."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to Old Town. I thought the drinks were poured well and the wine list was good.  The steaks were on the good side of salty but they were very tasty. They were all cooked exactly as ordered. I also liked that they had Walleye on the fish menu.  The decor was simple and classic. It was perfect for a steakhouse.  My only complaint is that they use iceberg lettuce. The wasabi dressing was excellent though and pretty much made up for it."}
{"text":"Just left from dinner. . Service from Kristen  awesome.   Food was great.   The cut was wider than I'm used to but tender and flavorfull.  We had porterhouse, ribeye and chicken.   Hubby thought food should be warmer.   The rest was fine.   Salad was so filling and fresh.   3 go boxes.  Ill be back and enjoy hh with some of my friends! LAINIE?   one of the people in charge was very diligent in her work. I was very impressed with the speed of everything being cleaned up and ready to go for the next group.   Busy Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"First time here with my family, good spot for our Christmas eve dinner. Good food and great service! Jessie took such good care of us. Enthusiastic and informative and accommodating. My steak accidentally came out the wrong temperature, but Jessie took care of it right away and even gave us a complimentary piece of theirs delicious 6 layer cake! We appreciated the fantastic service, thank you Jessie!"}
{"text":"Last night's dinner was really really good. But we had to wait 55 minutes for our food to show up 30 minutes for drinks to show up while other tables around us came in after us was served and finished before us. So it was the kitchen or servers staff? We used to go all the time but not anymore."}
{"text":"Nice steak, great service, poor lighting. That sums up my dinner. Price is on the high side, but you get quality cut of meat. Juicy and tender, beat the other steakhouse hands down.  Deco is tasteful, but could do more lighting."}
{"text":"I left the restaurant fuming.  What a waste of money for all the aggravation! Our family tries to support local restaurants and have been to this location 3 times previously.  This is NOT a family friendly restaurant.  My kids are 5 and 8. They do not have a kids menu so the previous time we ordered an adult entree and had the kids share. Today  we paid for 2 extra sides for the kids to share.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $88 dollars.  I noticed a $4 \"sharing\" charge which I was not charged the previous 3 times.  I asked the manager  CHRIS WALTERMAN to remove the charge because it was 2 small kids sharing and explained that we were never charged this before. He absolutely refused.  I told him how upset that made me.    ..yet he wouldn't budge.  He was talking to us in front of 2 other tables yet he did not care.  I asked if I should take the $4 out of the tip and he stated again he did not care. Well I do care!  Can you imagine having a supervisor like that? What happened to customer service?  This manager certainly does not know.  He was also doubling as the bar tender.  I have never posted a review before but I feel all should know his policy. FAMILIES BEWARE!!!!  The table behind us was having the same issue. as they too had to small kids.  I hope the owner's take this review seriously.  School moms love to talk and my experience will spread though out the school.   I am going to email the owners and hope that they reply.  It seems that other reviews had service issues too.  At this point I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant for families!"}
{"text":"A great evening. Called a week before for a reservation for a special event. No problems. Called the day of the move the time. No problems. Got there and the table was reserved in a marvelous part of the restaurant. Great greeter. Service was terrific. Food was sensational. Unlike many restaurants where they rush you, no such thing at DC.  A wonderful evening. Will come back again ... soon. Many thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good.  I had the walleye pike with sweet potato fries .  It is not common to find pike on a menu so it's a nice change from salmon.  I followed the pike with the lava cake with ice cream.  Normally the bf and I share dessert but this is so good we each had to have our own to keep the peace.  I had barely eaten all day so to end the day with such a great meal was a real treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times and have almost always been happy with the food.  The steaks are always cooked to perfection, the cheese curds are yummy and their house peppercorn ranch dressing is,delightful.  My husband always orders this chicken pasta dish they have and he really loves it.  The one thing I have started to notice is that the service is not always up to par with what you'd like it to be for this class of a restaurant.  When they are seating large parties, they still assign those wait staff members normal small tables and heaven help you if you are sitting at one of those small tables.  Last time we couldn't get bread, we couldn't get our drink order taken and our regular order was not taken till 25 minutes after we were seated.  In their defense they were very busy, but I was irked because we had a reservation and because there were many other servers and the greeter walking by us and could see we had no bread or drinks and yet no one would help us.  I think the servers should be more helpful to each other, but maybe they have a policy against it? Not sure, but I really think this place could benefit from assistant waiters whose sole job is to deliver bread, drinks and extra condiments, etc. to ensure the meal experience is a great one.  We love to frequent the Triple George steakhouse in Las Vegas, and they have the assistant waiters and I tell you that it elevates the dining experience from good to exquisite.  That being said, I will still go back.  As I said, the food and the ambience really just make this a wonderful dining experience and our family all really loves this place!    The desserts are awesome, as another review said, I do advise refraining from the appetizer so you can save room for the fantastic and delectable ever changing desserts!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience the first time we tried here a couple months ago. We had friends in town to entertain and decided to come back. Not to go into a rant on details, it was a horrible dinner for 4. The server had several chances ro make things right but decided to explain the complaints away. The eggplant wasnt too much batter it was because eggplant doesn't have much taste.    The spaghetti pasta wasn't suppose to have much flavor it was the subtle style that most like. Honestly it wasnt the waiter that was the issue it was the quality of the meat that disappointed the most.   None of us finished our dinners unfortunately. I guess it could have been a bad night, but we will not be coming back to test that theory.   By far the least value I have gotten when spending over $100 a plate in my years of taking clients or family out for dinner.   2"}
{"text":"Saturday was Valentine's day and my girlfriend and I went to D.C.Steak house. THe meal was fantastic and the server Joe was great also. She had the Surf and Turf(Lobster tail and a filet)and I had the Ribs and Filet. We enjoyed everything very much. Our reservation was at 4:30 and we where the second table to be sat that day by the time we left the restarant was completly packed.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"A group of four of us had a 7:00 reservation Christmas Eve.  They were running about 30 minutes behind. We finally got seated around 7:30 but it was well worth the delay.  Our waitress, Jess E, was unbelievable. She went over and above, taking care of all our needs without being overbearing. The food was absolutely delicious. Two of us had the filet with lobster tail, while our wives had the grilled shrimp.  Everything was cooked perfectly!!  We had a great time and well worth the price, we'll be back.   Please let Jesss E know she is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place looks very nice and our server was great, but multiple accidents earned them one star.  When bread was brought to our table, the server spilt vinegar and oil across our table and the hostess was like \"eh, we'll just put a napkin over it.\"  Then when my steak came out, instead of the medium rare I had asked for, I got a well done one.  Thirty minutes later, my new steak comes out while my wife's meal is finished/cold.  My second steak was very good at least.  At no time did the manager come by to apologize for any of this nor was anything taken off the bill.  It's almost as if they think it's your privilege to spend well over $100 there for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was okay but way overpriced.   Came here another time for late night dessert and the gin & tonic as well as the old fashioned were $9.  Watered down.  Not worth it.  Chocolate 7 layer cake was absurdly unhealthy and not great...we ate less than half."}
{"text":"Tried DC Steakhouse again after a 2 year hiatus because our first experience wasn't worth writing about.  This time around we were very impressed with our server, Gavin, and our food...perfectly grilled ribeye and veal chop.  We had very good salads that come with the entrees as well as baked potatoes.  It was a bit pricey but so few restaurants serve veal chops that I won't complain too loudly about the price.   Based on this second experience, we definitely will go back to DC Steakhouse. Thanks to Check Please Arizona for reviewing it this month and bringing it back to our attention."}
{"text":"Great place.  Had wine and wings on the patio.  Nice way to spend a cool evening with friends.  Service and food was very good."}
{"text":"Solid meal. Had the rib eye steak and it was very good. I think it was called \"D.C. Style\" which means it comes with two shrimp and some asparagus. The asparagus was a little thin but they served it under the steak so it soaked up all that steak juice which was awesome. The shrimp was also very good. I ordered my steak with fries and they were really good. Reminded me of a shoe string version of 4 peaks fries, which are my favorite.   Our waiter, I'm pretty sure his name was Kevin, was very attentive.   Overall it I think it's a solid steakhouse with upscale food and service that you could wear shorts to and not feel out of place, which I dig. It's a good option if you live in the East Valley and don't want to drive real far for a good meal."}
{"text":"We went to DC Steak House with a Groupon, because as I have mentioned before, I love steak.    The service was good.  Everybody was polite and prompt (although the restaurant was not very busy).  The vibe was intimate and classy.  We started with some wine, which was good.  I'm no wine connoisseur though, I'm easy to please.  The salad was average.  It was a simple side salad, exactly like I would make at home.  My boyfriend and I both I ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato; mine was medium and his medium rare.  I felt like they both came as ordered, although I neglected to ask him his opinion.  The steak was juicy and tender, the potato was a potato, and my only complaint was the heavy taste of charcoal at the end of the cut of meat.  I would go back, but I admit I'm more likely to go to Outback if we're comparing value."}
{"text":"For a pricey upscale steakhouse, the food does not meet the criteria.  I know someone who worked in the kitchen and here is the low down.  They cook the steaks in movie theater \"butter\". Crazy amounts of salt.  Almost all of the food is frozen, not locally sourced. This is more like Red Lobster or Longhorns than a fine dining establishment.  I make better steak and seafood at home. Save your money."}
{"text":"Great steaks. One of the best we have ever had.  Service is very good and friendly but still professional. Each course is timely, not rushed nor too slow. Atmosphere is comfortable, music volume  is perfect.  Will  be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the 8 ounce filet mignon (medium). So very tasty and so unbelievably tender I only used my fork to cut it. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"I believe this is the third time that I've this place and I already forgot all about the food. Is pretty uneventful and kind of pricey for what you get.  I had the rib eye which was burned on the outside and a little over cooked. It seems that it was too close to the source of heat or something like that.  The only interesting thing were the mushrooms that came with the steak. Those where tasteful.  Unfortunately nothing to highlight about the food.  The service was bad and it took forever. I mean, over an hour to get our food or so.  The waiter was trying but he didn't do a great job. I'm sure the kitchen didn't worked for him either.   I also tried the hamburger and it was barely OK.   At the end, I volunteered to pay my part (including some extra money for the shared dishes-calamari and fried mozzarella sticks- but then the waiter divided it by customer.  I overheard him saying that he charged somebody the wine (which I didn't try) and somebody else the shared plates (I guess I owe them some cash for that haha). I thought that was hilarious (in a wrong way).  The only good thing (I guess) is that that incident took my memory to my college years where cheap mofos always used to hit me and my friends with the bill taking off the booze (since we always drank) but divided in equal parts the rest (with all kinds of shizzle that they use to order).  It's amazing how people can forget that they had a soft drink (that it's never free), that they stuck their forks in the shared dishes, that they ordered a desert with Kahlua, fire, and ice cream made out of opossum's milk and gold paper with a tag way higher than 3 drinks.   And of course, douches always forgot that there's something called tip!  I don't need to say that when I use to go out with that people, the bill was always a s@#$ show!  Oh, the good'al years. I don't miss those douches at all lmao!  Fortunately my new friends are not chepos!"}
{"text":"Brutal reviews must be from the competition, because we love this place!  Have eaten there many times since they opened and always had great service, friendly staff and good food!  I like that it isn't a chain, go to Outback instead?  Wow....doesn't compare unless you like a ton of seasoning covering up any semblance of meat flavor or maybe prefer bland flavorless food?   The salads and dressing are always fresh, flavorful..the steak has great flavor with a perfect sear.  Wine list is nice, dessert yummy all served in a nice setting- patio seating is the best!  Keep up the good work DC-we love you and will be dining there again this week!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!! Luckily we had a groupon. It took over an hour between our salad and getting our steaks. Our waiter was like Casper. We would have had a bigger tab if we would have seen him more than once. Food was pretty good but not really anything special!"}
{"text":"Epic fail. We stopped for drinks and no one ever even spoke to us. Obviously don't get economics. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner in DC Steakhouse. The ribeye steak and filet & prawns always taste good!  Service was great too...a little pricier but it's worthy."}
{"text":"Alex was awesome food was amazing prime rib and rib eye are recommended. Price reasonable go check it out :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm my opinion the best Steak House in Chandler/Gilbert for your money. Always good quality, attention to detail, good atmosphere and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First off, this place looks like a great date place. The kind of place you can can bring your girlfriend and please her while still getting your grub on. It isn't. To say this place was a major disappointment is an understatement.   The Good... I ordered steak and ribs and these were okay. The place looks real nice, intimate.   The Bad... The price on everything because... The place is crazy loud and the tables are so close together you can't get to the bathroom w/o bumping someone. The Service was pretty bad. My beer was expensive and tasted awful. When I brought this up, she didn't care. Further she was hardly ever around. I had to pay extra for my side Cesar. My Wife, had an even worst experience. Her food was Awful. The lobster was overcooked, tasted bad. Her salad was awful, borderline spoiled/wilted. our sides were undercooked. Then I had to listen about all this for like 3 hours. To top it all off, we paid premium prices as if this place was Flemings or something. Seriously, if you want okay steak go to Outback or something cause this place is only going to ruin your night."}
{"text":"First off I want to say this is no high quality Steakhouse this is more compared to a longhorn or Black Angus not saying those are bad but comparable call see how busy they were and if I need a reservation guy on the phone was very rude and short that should have been my first time so show up a little early only three tables there so got in right away server was quick to the table to get our drinks started off with the a shrimp cocktail shrimps in the be really tough maybe overcooked didn't care for the cocktail sauce either it was a little too bland for me not enough spice so kind of disappointing so if my order I order their porterhouse steak which honestly was probably one of the worst things I've ever had taste it like it was microwaved or something it was just off flavor no good or had no seasoning I thought it was just me until my cousin said something about it he always finish his food but this you didn't finish and he just said it gross for me never go back much better places for less money what's your pain here go to Capital or somewhere else like that"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we got to do a kid free date night, so we decided to try DC Steakhouse. I had heard some nice feedback from friends on them. We decided to go on a Sunday night thinking that it would be slower (and easier to find a baby sitter), and made a reservation for 5 pm. When we arrived, we were shocked at the full house. Yeah, that means that they must be good, right?  They had one table left, basically right in front of the door, and we were fine taking it.   We had originally planned to get an appetizer to split; however, nothing offered really appealed to either of us. We decided to get a beer (no draft) and a glass of wine. I almost always get a filet at a steak place, so I went with the medium size one so my husband could get a chunk of it too. He was so thrilled to see lamb chops on the menu, and quickly decided up it.  About the time our salads arrived, our waiter came back to tell us that they were out of lamb.  =/ Hubby was very disappointed, and changed his order to the smaller NY Strip. The salad were average...standard iceberg type mix with romaine. When our meal arrived, I was a bit surprised to see the potatoes wrapped in foil, but just quickly peeled it off. My filet was AMAZINGLY fantastic...perfect medium rare and so tender it was like butter! An item worth returning for without a doubt!  My husband's Ny was ok. He ordered his medium, so it had a heavier char taste (smoky) and was no where near as tender. He happily scarfed my exterior pieces that were more done, and we brought about 1/2 of his home. We decided to try one of the desserts, and when with the key lime pie. I was a bit surprised with the first bite to taste coconut.  Overall, I'd rate the desert simply ok. We'll certainly be back, but neither the NY or the key lime pie will make the menu. Again, the filet was amazing and totally worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Great steak, great cocktails, great service! We were lucky to have been given a gift certificate and enjoyed every bit of it! Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"DC Steakhouse is a pretty decent steakhouse that provides great value.  This steakhouse is not on the level of a Morton's, Ruth Chris or even a Fleming's but their prices reflect that as they serve Angus beef not USDA Prime.  With all due respect to a previous reviewer, the prices here are not the same as Fleming's.  An 8oz filet here costs $34 while at Fleming's it costs $43.95.  And, here salad and some sort of potato (baked potato or fries) are included in the price.  The fish selections here are pretty minimal so you are better off sticking to a basic steak. My issue with this restaurant is not the food but the acoustics- it is LOUD in here.  I couldn't hear the people sitting at my own table. Overall though, a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is overrated. I do have to say that the waiter was excellent. The bread they gave us was nothing special. We ordered the shrimp cocktail for the appetizer and it was very good shrimp  We ordered salads with blue cheese dressing and blue cheese crumbles.  The salad was good.  What we really went there for was the steak.  I ordered the 5-ounce filet mignon (medium)...supposed to be pink in the center, all the way through.  It was not and there was no flavor to the meat at all. I could not eat it.  My husband order the small ribeye and it was the same, was not pink all the way though the center and it had no flavor. He could not eat his, either.  The waiter did not come back to see how we liked the steaks, so we did not want to wait for another. The baked potatoes were forgettable.  Nice ambiance, but we won't go back."}
{"text":"Found DC Steak House via Groupon.  Overall the experience was a pleasant one. Our waiter was very professional and attentive. Bread was fresh but nothing to write home about.  Steaks were very nice and cooked just right.  Ribeye could have been more tender and had a bit of gristle, but not too bad.  Flavor was great.  My friend was very pleased with his filet.    Sweet potato fries were very good, but a baked sweet potato would have been a better option, in my opinion.  Chocolate lava cake was wonderful!  Definitely one of the best I've had.  The only thing that took away from the experience involved the menu.  The menu on their web site says the 12 oz. filet is priced at $41.  The menu we were handed in the restaurant said the 12 oz. filet is priced at $41.  BUT, when my friend ordered the 12 oz. filet, the waiter explained that the price had gone up to $47.  Seriously?  The price has gone up, but the menu hasn't been changed?  No sticker?  No sharpie turning the 1 into a 7?  Just wait for someone to order and THEN explain it costs more?  Not very professional!"}
{"text":"I had to break the trend of decent reviews for DC Steak House, I really did want to like it.  Downtown Chandler has needed a place like this and we had really high hopes for it.  They bill themselves as being between the lower end and the higher end steak houses and they nailed it when it comes to the final bill, sadly they didn't when it comes to the food.  I honestly believe that this is the first steak house I have ever been to that would not let me substitute out the side house salad for a side ceaser salad.  The waiter told me that he could get fired if he asked the kitchen to do that for me.  Even the lower end places allow that.  When it came to the steak, I ordered the $31 fillet which was probably a decent cut of meat, but my definition of medium rare and their definition seems to be very different.  There was no way that my steak was anything other than medium well.  I wouldn't mind paying something higher than what I can get at the national chain places if I actually had a meal that was better than what I can get at those same chains."}
{"text":"Loved this place...such an elegant but casual vibe with friendly and efficient servers, amazing food, and a one of a kind experience. The moscato I had was delicious! We had shrimp cocktail, a pork chop sandwich, open faced steak sandwich, and key lime pie for dessert. It's hard to cook a steak well done and have it still be juicy and tender. The chef was amazing...the steak literally melted in my mouth! And the key lime pie was heaven. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dinner last night,party of 6.  Waiter was overextended with 4 or 5 tables.  Every request required multiple conversations.  Salads were brutal....warm and not fresh. Bread was cold and getting drinks refilled was a task.  Mgr told us that they were short staffed and our waiter was also filling in as the bartender.  Thank You very much for the one and done visit.  By the way the steaks were really good but the overall experience was not  If the was a 0 star rating that would be it"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed, our friends came down from California for d fist time since we've moved here and we researched this place because we love steak and my friends knows a lot about beef being his from Wisconsin, we ordered the ribeye and it lacked flavor, I pour salt on that steak so much that it made me just plainly sad to have in front of me a great looking and cooked steak with no flavor at all, the salad had hardly any dressing I had to ask for more and  to top this off we got home and within a few hrs my husband and 2 friends were vomiting and were exploding from all ends and my both rooms and even tubs and sinks were destroyed , luckily for myself besides a bad tummy pain I was spared from vomiting.  Bottom line is that we paid a pretty penny for a great meal and experience and it gave us food poisoning.  Sunday December 20th"}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Chandler. Opted for indoor dining and we weren't disappointed. The service was timely and friendly. Our waiter new his menu and took our order promptly. Cold crab appetizers was fresh and delicious. Recommend the veal chop. A little pricey but worth it. Check it out."}
{"text":"The food delish!!  Steve's shrimp great as always; steaks done perfectly, desserts out of this world(limoncello cake so light and tasty and chocolate molten cake with ace cream were both to die for.  This is a wonderful restaurant for Chandler to have."}
{"text":"For our first visit we picked outside seating to enjoy the perfect Arizona evening.  Our waitress stopped over to the table and introduced herself to us and asked about our drinks.  After we ordered, we shared with her that this was our first time there and wanted her opinion on what the signature dishes were so we could sample the best the place had to offer.  She highlighted the menu was filled with steaks and chops - delightful because that's right up my alley.  We ordered a fillet cooked medium and a rare ribeye, along with the salads and sides.  Our drinks and warm bread came promptly and we enjoyed conversation while the jazz laced with a heavy Sinatra influence continued to frame the evening.  Our salads followed along in short order.  Traditional dinner salads with light but nicely flavored dressings that didn't overpower the natural flavors.  Just as we were finishing, our entrees arrived with near perfect timing.    I'm an advocate of great dinning experiences and a part of that is presentation.  My ribeye cut was perfectly seared with large squared markings served with sauteed mushrooms and garnished tastefully.  A side of sweet potato fries completed the dish.  The steak was tender, juicy and naturally flavored with light seasoning.  No unnatural or heavy seasoning added to mask the taste or the very high quality cut.  Cutting into the ribeye was really a pleasure.  Nice marbling, wonderful flavor that still makes my mouth water thinking about it today.  The sauteed mushrooms were a perfect compliment to the rich flavor of the steak.  Perfectly cooked to my liking, rich and rare. The sweet potato fries were thin but the salt and slightly sweet flavor came out in just the right balance.  Overall an exceptional experience and we'll certainly return soon."}
{"text":"We were hesitant in trying DC Steakhouse because of the recent negative reviews, but our experience here was fantastic. We didn't make reservations, thinking it wouldn't be that busy on a Tuesday evening, but to our surprise it was packed when we arrived. The ambience is nice and upscale. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's a bit dark and a little loud, but that didn't bother us at all.   We ended up sitting at the bar for about a half hour and enjoyed a few drinks while we waited for an open table. The bartender was sweet and made a few recommendations from the menu, so by the time we got to our table, we were ready to order (and starving!) Our server, Spencer, was attentive from start to finish. Our glasses were never empty and our plates cleared promptly. As for the most important part, the food: both my husband's steak and my blackened salmon were cooked to perfection and mouth-wateringly delicious. My husband said it was the best steak he's had in years. Our side dishes were excellent as well. I had every intention of enjoying a dessert here, but there was no room for that this time.  It was an enjoyable meal and we will definitely be back. My advice: don't let the negative reviews scare you away!! Also, there's a Groupon special going on right now. Just purchased mine :)"}
{"text":"Michael is the best server ever!!!! He had great wine recommendations, and was super attentive to our needs.  I highly recommend this place and Michael."}
{"text":"Since someone had already mentioned the lobster tail I thought I would give it a go. I came for the steak but will come back for the lobster. I could have used a bigger one probably because it was so good. Yes, as a matter of fact it was the best I've ever had. The other people in our party had the steak. Sirloin and filet. They both said it was fantastic. Love the shrimp cocktail, even though $4 a shrimp is quite pricey. Asparagus great! Service was great. I had no problem in that area."}
{"text":"Went to the DC twice this last week while visiting. Both times I went in late for dinner and had the Filet Mignon - wow! It was terrific! I ordered it a tad over medium and it came out perfectly cooked. It was so tender and delicious...my mouth is watering right now thinking about it! And what a value.. any steakhouse you go, to you pay well over $35 for the meat alone and get ala carted to death - not here! The steak was priced in the $20s and included a soup or salad, as well as a side dish! Oh and mushrooms! Mushrooms alone can cost you $9 at other steakhouses. ( Just went to another steakhouses website and priced out my meal...at those \"high end chains\" my meal would have cost $52! )  I just love the atmosphere! The dark lighting makes it feel so intimate and the murals on the wall are beautiful!   Another plus - its family owned and operated! Hate giving my money to all the big chains! The owners are from Wisconsin, so you know you will get that great midwestern charm!"}
{"text":"This hands down is the best restaurant in Chandler! The atmosphere gets a 10, it's charming and quaint. The lighting is perfect, it's dim which makes for a romantic dinner! I love the fact that this restaurant has character and is not like a new chain restaurant!  DC steak is way better than Maestros and Ocean club in Scottsdale; I would choose DC steak over those two any day! Not to mention the menu prices are very reasonable!!! The grilled shrimp were a 10 and the best mash potatoes I have ever eaten! The vodka tonics were great with a  good pour. I can't wait to go back!! The service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great place...warm, cozy, elegantly lit and lots of interesting decor and things to look at.  It's in a nice location on the corner in DTC.  Service was good and the bartenders were attentive.  Unfortunately my trend continues, regardless of the steakhouse, of being nothing but disappointed with the cost to enjoyment ratio when eating steak outside the house.  YES it is good and YES the quality is good but just not that much better than I can bust out with a steak from Costco and my backyard grill at one tenth the price.  Dropped $410 here for two couples noting we had two bottles of moderately priced wine.  Considering that, I think I have finally learned my lesson that I'm just not a steakhouse guy.  I'll work on the fish and I'll leave the bovines for other folk.    If you are steak junky I'm pretty sure you will love this place.  Better than most for sure but if you casually like steak like me, you might find your ass a little too light on the way out."}
{"text":"Horrid service.  The steaks were okay -- the owner, the staff, and the service were an absolute nightmare.   Don't bother making a reservation--it won't be honored. I had AMEX Centurion make the reservation two-weeks in advance so we'd have a good table and we still got shoved to the back of the restaurant for a \"big party\" that would be occupying the tables near the front windows.   Quick Note: The \"big party\" never got seated before we'd eaten and paid the bill.   BUT!! The big party people did show up in the bar area where we'd been seated (despite our reservation) and gathered all round our table for an OPEN-BAR happy hour thrown by the I'm flying solo, birthday girl herself and proceeded to get drunk and loud just INCHES from our table--sometimes butt-bumping our backs as we tried to hurry up and consume our steaks. The staff and management did NOTHING to remedy this problem other than to offer us a free round of drinks(we declined). We had to ask the people ourselves to respect our space, which with a large group of drinkers was pointless.   Speaking of the management -- if you're a day under 70 the owner won't visit your table. A \"manager\" will come by one time and dispassionately ask how things are, but not the owner. He hung out at all of the tables chatting with folks from Sun Lakes.  No one who seemed to be in charge really acted like they were glad we came there to spend our money.  Actually, no one really was taking charge--leadership was in short supply.  The experience will make for an excellent business lecture someday.    The waiter: our waiter's service button was turned down to just a shade better than completely ignore. We had to ask him for everything including cracked pepper for the salads and water refills.   Then there was the annoying blonde-ish girl behind the bar who, while attempting to be funny/witty, answered my questions with questions or equivocations.    And it goes on and on--if you've read to here you get the point.  There's not a surprise Disney movie ending where it all got better--it just got worse.    Don't waste your money.    I'd like to have more options in the Downtown Chandler business area and see restaurants stay, but I'll never go back to the DC Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Four of were there for dinner. Three of the four steaks were not cooked according to their own definitions of medium and medium rare. The server seemed to have us non a \"pay no mind\" list. He messed up one person's order. Completely forgot about the drink orders that were made. Took another server to get our condiments. The steak I had tasted no better than the lower priced counterparts at Texas Roadhouse ."}
{"text":"It was the first time my wife and I visited DC Steakhouse and it sure brought back great memories from the past.   The location for this restaurant was previously our favorite hangout for great food and wine years ago when it was 98 South. The location has been through several changes of ownership and concept since 98 South closed and until our visit to DC Steakhouse on 6/19, we never felt the desire to come back.   The decor still exhudes the same vibe as our old haunt and is a comfortable, casual, romantic environment, with background music by some of the greatest singers from an earlier generation... so you can actually enjoy a pleasant conversation without having to yell across the table at each other.  We're not big meat eaters or late diners, and I'm alergic to shrimp, crab & lobster (boo), so we decided to check the place out during happy hour. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Not knowing many of the wines on their list, she was happy go bring a taste of several that we requested. We selected the Hahn Pinot Noir, which provided a pleasant pairing with our menu choices.  The HH offerings seamed to be an excellent value, so for our \"appetizer\" we ordered the Open-Faced Tenderloin Steak Sandwich ($7) which came with sweet potato fries. We ordered it Medium and it came Medium Well, but we were still pleasantly surprised flavor wise. It's an excellent value and we'll definitely be back to try some of the other HH selections whenever we feel like dining early. Hopefully the next time, the steak will come served as ordered, as one would expect from a place with \"Steakhouse\" in their name.  For the entré, I ordered the pan fried Walleye pike ($21) with mixed green salad and wth baked potato, which we shared. You don't find Walleye often in Arizona restaurants and since we both grew up in the Midwest it's a must try. The fish was fresh, flavorful and highly satisfying. We'll definitely order it again, perhaps the broiled version... although the Cajun Salmon did catch our eye. Decisions, decisions, decisions.  TIP, there is a \"shared plate\" charge of $10, but their Happy Hour sandwiches count as an entré, so if you're like us and usually share an appetizer and entré, go during HH to avoid the shared plate fee.  While we still miss the original 98 South and the eclectic menu from PT Barnum, DC Steakhouse has been added to the \"take our friends\" list of go to places whenever we venture outside Gilbert. It's definitely a reason for a drive to old town Chandler."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such high reviews. It was such a disappointment. The bread had a weird soggy texture, totally tasteless. We got salads with the house dressing but it had chunks of peppercorn in it. My stepfather and I both ordered the 1/2 rack. It was ok. Def not worth $18! I've had better ribs at TGIF lol my mom got the pike fish. She said on a scale of 1 to 10 she'd give it a 6. But what angered me the most was that we had to wait over an hour for our food! If u wait a long time and the food is worth it than fine but it so wasn't worth it. I will say the wait staff was really very professional and on point."}
{"text":"The stars are only for the bar, which I would give it five except we had dinner in the restaurant and that knocked it down two.  First the bar. Great bartenders, really nice bar, awesome cocktails. But then we sat for dinner. Disappointing service and the food is subpar. It didn't help that our waitress got our order wrong. It also didn't help that we ordered not only the lobster tail but a lobster add-on, specifically requested that they not overcook. Both came out extremely dry and were sent back.  We never were served any bread. We had the house salad with blue cheese dressing that obviously came from a vat in the back labled BluCheez. But really our waitress was not good at all. She clearly didn't want to be there, really had no interest in us and it showed. The steak wasn't that great either. First, it wasn't the one I ordered but also it was over seasoned and had some kind of sauce on it. The only reason we'd come back is for a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"The DC stands for \"Downtown Chandler\".  It's a casual steak house.  Since I'm not from Chandler, and not familiar with other steak options, I'd say this is likely the best place in Chandler.   Let me say first this is a great spot as for Chandler options..but not against other top notch options in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  It's a neighborhood steak house, and they do an amazing job at that.  The service and food (filet) and loaded baked potato were great.    I'd say lose the Wisconsin Cheese Curds as an appetizer...who eats mozzarella sticks before an awesome steak? Need to change that.  (I didn't order cheese curds, my date did)  They had a bunch of dessert options but I was so full...from mozzarella sticks/cheese curds, salad and filet.    If you are looking for a family/casual style steakhouse in Chandler swing on by. Might be some kids/might be some grandma's/grandpa's or both, but just be prepared for that type of crowd.   Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"The food here was extremely good and the service was great! Highly Recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"First visit with my wife tonight on our date night. We stumbled by it and it was such a treat. Great steaks, great atmosphere, and good service. Was a little pricy but made for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Took 5 other people there on a Thursday night for a business dinner. Jake did a great job taking care of us.   I ordered shrimp appetizers,  one cold and one hot plus calamari for the table.   The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked.  I had the salmon which was awesome.  Others had steak,  shrimp,  and other appetizers.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  One ordered chocolate cake for dessert which got passed around.   Plenty to share and my bite was delicious.  Entrees here are priced below most of the upscale Steakhouses and include a salad and side!  Great place for special occasions or just a casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Steaks were amazing. Calamari was delicious as was grilled asparagus. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so bad. It's convenient, and it's the neighborhood steakhouse.   They have a fabulous happy hour that I absolutely love.  The happy hour keeps us coming back week after week. Especially the filet sandwich...to die for.  Unfortunately, every time we have ventured off the happy hour for a sit down meal with steaks, baked potato, and the works, we leave disappointed :-( the most recent disappointment was our medium rare steak being significantly undercooked. C'mon guys when your paying $40 for a steak, you expect it to be correct. The restaurants solution is to leave your potato and lobster at the table to get cold while they re-cook your same steak. Frustrating!  So we ate the sides by itself so they wouldn't get cold, and vow never to eat anything BUT the happy hour."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going here; especially with a $25 coupon. Sign up on their mailing list. We have received 2 coupons in the past year.  The steaks are great and well seasoned. Ditto for the fish.  Their wines are good and a must!!  Service is balanced- good yet not intrusive."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for years despite living in Chandler for 20 years. A high school friend and his wife came up last week for a visit and said the place looked good. I told them the last time I visited was Mother's Day the food was delicious so we obliged.   Great service from Shelly and fantastic food that night So much so that my husband and I came back a week later (tonight) and we had dinner at the bar.  I enjoyed a phenomenal 5 Oz filet mignon steak  - cooked medium rare so perfect it melted in my mouth! My husband really liked the lobster and steak!   We were also wonderfully entertained by Chudini at the bar - great street magician who also bartends!"}
{"text":"The Good:  Atmosphere was lovely. They have a really cute space.  Our server was super sweet.  The French fries are tasty.  Their mushrooms were tasty too.  The Meh:  My husband said his steak was ok. Not quite as good as we can do at home with meat from the butcher, not quite as good as Texas Roadhouse, but not as bad as Outback or Applebees.   After all of the following \"bad\", the lovely server brought us a slice of cake on the house. (Nice & relatively tasty if a tad bit dry, however we're on a diet so only ate a couple bites anyhow.)   The Bad:  To spite their sign containing the word \"cocktail\" they do not actually have fruit here. That means if you order something like a Gin Ricky, all you get  is disappointment in a glass. (Bar lime = Gross) This may not be a big deal to most, but we came here because of wanting a nice cocktail. Hell, it was in the sign! A very bad start.  The bread they give you pre-meal is dry, cold, and reminiscent of averaged sliced bread.   The salad was a nice blend of lettuce, but no idea why they serve it with a full quarter of a tomato. (Seriously? Dice or spring for cherry tomatoes) Also, maybe find a new source for pepperoncinis, maybe one where the peppers aren't petrified like ancient wood.  DO NOT ORDER FISH! Three bites of the Walleye & I had collected half a dozen bones. Not just tiny ribs either. A couple were like ribs + cartilage that were seriously choking hazards. We're very non-confrontational folk, but this was too much. When brought to our servers attention she apologized profusely & offered something else, but said the fish just had bones and a different fillet would probably have them too. I don't know who they have as their chef, but he should be kept far away from fish. All animals have bones! I still don't want to eat them. Any reasonable chef knows to look over a raw filet & pluck ribs. Please, please, please, DO NOT ORDER FISH FOR SMALL CHILDREN OR OLDER FOLK. Not exaggerating, it's a choking hazard & you will get zero warning.  Really wanted to like it here, but will not come back. Get some fruit to offer a \"complete\" bar & maybe find a more experienced chef. I don't expect perfection, but for the price point this should have been much better."}
{"text":"Excellent pan fried walleye coupled with a good salad blue cheese dressing and good baked potato. Appetizer of deep fried mushrooms very good. Portions very liberal. Jessie our server most attentive and friendly as well as helpful. The walleye really did make it great."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Friday night and finding parking was very difficult.  We ended up parking several blocks away and walking a distance to the restaurant.  Definitely make reservations as the place was packed.  The food was very good, but pricey. Also, it was very noisy. I could just barely hear my date above the din. All-in-all, this is a good restaurant,  but not a great one."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time.  My bone in Ribeye (this girl goes all out with steak) was cooked perfectly.  The side items were a perfect compliment.  We sat at the bar so enjoyed meeting Mandi.  She gives top notch service."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING!! Had Daniel as a waiter. He was very in tune with the fact we were with another couple trying to catch up on time past and did not interrupt once. He had other tables and still let us take our time and set the pace for the evening. We had an appetizer, good. We had salads, all good. We had one order filet mignon, she let everyone have a taste, melted in your mouth. Two of us had the ribeye, bone out, perfectly cooked medium-rare. One had the bone in ribeye, cooked rare and he said it was great. Way to full to eat dessert but would like to try our next visit. Great date night. We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Wife and I skipped out for a night with no kids to enjoy an evening to ourselves.  The ambiance is nice and quiet, which was bliss.  The wait staff is prompt and courteous, without being too formal.  The food was fantastic.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was amazing, including lightly coated prawns (some sort of garlic oil maybe) and a bold, robust cocktail sauce which had the perfect amount of horseradish and kick.  The salads were great. We both had steaks and they came out cooked perfectly like we ordered.  We topped it off with a salted caramel cheesecake dessert which was also something to note.  The manager is a very nice gentleman who always made sure we were taken care of without being overwhelming.  Great experience!  All in all, this is a fantastic dinner spot.  The food was pretty good and on par with most of the steak houses in the area.  I can't wait to go back and try something else.  Big thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit at DC a bit ago. It was s celebration dinner. Appetizers to meal were great and flavorful and plentiful.   Always gets busy here since I also live downtown so make reservations and enjoy a nice ambiance, intimate and cozy. Nice bar area in back and a little cramped in the dining room but you'll get past that. Horrible placement of hostess stand though. It felt akward checking in and there's not much cheaper if a wait area so we sat right by it so people stared at us eating the whole time. Great everything else otherwise- staff were friendly, price was acceptable, and food was good (audience or not)."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little spot in downtown Chandler they have an awesome selection of local brews as well as a great wine selection. Unfortunately, the food was impressively mediocre. The salad and fries were obviously thrown together in a few seconds .fries appeared to be store bought thick steak fries... The meat was high quality and so was the service. Beyond my overall impression was blahh."}
{"text":"Great ribeye steak and halibut.  Fantastic services.  Robert made our casual night extremely special."}
{"text":"We had reservations last night at 7:30pm, the same night as the Jazz festival.  Seated early and food and service was fantastic.    We will not go back till the lighting improves.  We mentioned it 2 prior visits and all for nothing apparently.  The entire dinner party had to use our phones to read the menus and see our food when it was served,and our table was directly under a light.  I literally touched the light while seated.  We asked our server if it was possible to turn up the lights so we could see, but she stated that they knew the problem, but could not turn up the lights without it being too bright.  A call to a commercial electrician can solve the problem with minimal cost.    We do not like eating in the dark.  We watched numerous patrons using their phones also.  Get with it owner.  Spend the few dollars and fix the lighting.  We have posted this due to lack of response by the owner to fix the problem.   Please post the problem resolved, or we and all our friends will not be back.  DC steakhouse can be better"}
{"text":"This is great steakhouse for Chandler, probably the best you'll find in the area! Good food, great service. I love the downtown chandler atmosphere and found this place to be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday night and it was packed.  We had a reservation for two and were seated promptly upon arrival. Waitress stopped by fairly soon after and took our drink order. Seemed fine except our two drinks (a beer and a house wine) took about 10 minutes to arrive.    When we ordered, I asked how marbled the top sirloin was. The waitress did not know what marbled meant and had to go to the kitchen to ask someone.  When she returned, I then inquired if they served steaks \"oscar\" style. She said yes but it was a $15 dollar additional charge which seemed like quite a lot given that the top sirloin by itself was only $21.  She then said that to add a lobster tail was only $12.    Based on her responses, I had no confidence in her and chose to order the fillet with sweet potato fries.  I asked if I could get mashed potatoes instead but she said it would be an extra charge as if I ordered a separate side of mashed potatoes.  I don't like that but at least she told me before I ordered it. So my wife and I both ordered fillets and shortly our salads arrived.  Nothing special here, just basic iceberg, average size.  After that, we had to ask for bread upon noticing other tables with bread baskets.  I was troubled that we needed to ask for it given this \"upscale\" steakhouse.    Fortunately our food arrived in a decent time and was cooked appropriately for both of us.  My wife ordered the baked potato loaded and it came bare, but immediately they brought out the toppings to correct it.  Our food was perfect and was truly the highlight of the night. In addition to our steaks, I ordered a side of asparagus and it was wonderfully prepared and delicious.  However, after the food arrived, we never saw the waitress again until well after finishing our meals.    So the food is great but the service leaves a lot to be desired both in timeliness but also in knowledge and courtesy for an upscale place.  We used a Groupon otherwise this place may be a crap shoot based on what type of server you get."}
{"text":"Blah! Is how I feel about this place and their food.  First off, no happy hour on a Friday's... no wonder it's so empty.   I came here with a group on Friday night.  We started out with the fried eggplant and calamari.  Neither one was anything to write home about.  The eggplant was flavorless and the calamari, well, was calamari.   My husband had a Mediterranean Mule for a drink, which was probably the best part about our visit.  Bar tending staff was really nice too and our waiter was attentive and got us what we needed.  For our entrees I had the salmon, nothing special, just salmon that came with a pile of wilted lettuce and croutons as a salad.  I didn't even eat it after our sever set it down.   My husband ordered the halibut, pretty tasty, but again came with a wilted pile of lettuce and croutons as a salad.  I had asparagus for my side which was oily and they didn't cut the stems off so it was hard when I bit into it.   My husband ordered lobster Mac n chz for his side.  Lots of Mac n chz, but no lobster in there.  Several other people in my party didn't finish their salads either,  it sure why but I can probably guess... lol.  Chocolate cake and tiramisu  for dessert was just ok.  They're probably not made in house.   This place is over priced and not worth it for the quality of food.  I would rather spend the extra money and go to Ruth's Chris or Fleming's for a nice steak dinner.  Sorry DC steakhouse"}
{"text":"Our company comes with a large group at least twice a month. Service is always solid and the ambiance is always great! I do not eat meat so i typically get the swordfish! YUMM. Although this time I tried the Cajun Salmon. The asparagus in a hollandaise sauce is a must try. Good luck saving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place fresh food very good service can't miss.  Wisconsonians own and opperate this quaint steakhouse."}
{"text":"Tried the calamari appetizer which was boring... but went on to the surf and turf. Steak was cooked perfect, lobster was amazing... suppose I would have liked more than 3 mushrooms... apparently that's the standard...maybe it's like coffee beans in Sambuca and any other number is bad luck?  In any case... the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't ate here yet! I love the ambiance, a nice break from the super casual norm in DT Chandler. Steaks are very reasonably priced, a perfectly cooked 6oz fillet for $22, including salad, a starch, great bread and great service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here 6x. 5 of the visits were very good . . . I'm editing a recent not so positive review for a good reason . . . everyone can have an off night. You know . . .one of those \"black hole\" nights . . . this Steakhouse is great for downtown Chandler . . .  But moving on . . . the quality of the food is 2nd to none. Great beef ( Rib eye) and they know how to prepare it. Grilled asparagus awesome . . . The service is very friendly and spot on. And the bar . . .ahhhhh . .. great martinis which every top shelf steak house should have. Jeff is an excellent bartender. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time recently with modest expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 18-ounce bone-in ribeye. It arrived at my table cooked to perfection, and it was tender, juicy and full of flavor. For my side I had sweet potato fries, which were delicious. Also, the bread that came with the meal was very good, while the salad was average. Service was spot-on. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy an above-average (albeit pricey) steak dinner in Chandler."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have great customer service and the food is always wonderful. This place never disappoints. I took my parents here for my mom's birthday and now they can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The walleye was great the best I have Had since I was back in MN last year"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a couple nights ago and was very pleased. I had the filet which was cooked perfectly. The salad with honey mustard was also delicious. The service was a bit slow, which is why I'm only giving them 4 stars.  It's priced well for a steak house - I'll definitely done here again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great atmosphere and great food! We started with some excellent Calamari then ordered steaks. The filet and ribeye are awesome!"}
{"text":"How do you run a business without a phone.  Their reservation system sucks.  Great food....OK service...but really....answer your frigging phone."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this restaurant so we decided to try it.  Had an 8 pm reservation for 7 people.  Table wasn't ready when we arrived on time but it was a Sat night and they were busy so we were patient.  Over the next hour we waited as our server made only two stops at our table, one to ask about drinks and one to finally bring them to us.  Finally at 9 pm he stopped by long enough to take our food order very quickly.  At 9:50 our entrees finally arrived.  We did receive a typical dinner salad during the 50 minutes between ordering and receiving the entree.  Mine was prime rib and a baked potato, and I had replied sour cream, no chives to the question re the potato.  I asked for butter for the potato, which NEVER came.  Hubby ordered the pan fried walleye, which can be a bony fish, but in his first two bites he pulled out at least 5 bones, which he laid on the plate.  Finally we flagged down out waiter to show him the bones and he replied that walleye is a bony fish.  I reminded him about butter for the potato.  The manager came by a few minutes later and offered to remake the fish, but the rest of our party was almost halfway through their meals so he declined, based on how late it was and how long the first plate took.  Server never returned until it was time to ask if we had room for dessert.  By this time most of the diners had exited the restaurant and the bar area, which is where we were seated, became quite noisy.  Despite continued waves at our server to hand him the bill and credit cards, he was more interested in what was happening at the bar.  I finally picked up the check and payment and walked over to the bar to flag down the manager.  That's when the server came running over and I reminded him he had never brought the butter and that his service was below par.  I also told the manager that she should have removed the fish from the bill.  Because we didn't accept her offer to remake the fish she felt we should pay for the bony fish, which was not eaten.  I reminded her about the length of time we waited for service and food and she told me that if we were unhappy we should have come to find her and she would have \"sped things up.\"  So the slow service was our fault because we didn't come to find her? She finally agreed to remove the fish dish from the bill and apologized and said \"next time, come and find me.\"  Reading the reviews, it seems like this restaurant is very inconsistent and most of the complaints are about service, not the food quality.  What a shame.  Not sure if we will come back, and if we do decide to give them another shot, it certainly won't be on a busy night.  If they can't handle the business on a Saturday in August, I'd hate to see what happens to this place during the busy winter!"}
{"text":"Always have a fantastic meal and amazing service!!  Great prices for really good food."}
{"text":"Normally this place has been very competent. Sometimes businesses when they get a little long in the tooth start to relax a bit too much.   I ordered lobster tails, sadly the wait was very long to get them, when they showed up one was perfect the other was like cotton.   Due to the wait, I decided to power through and eat them both with generous amounts of butter on the latter.   When the bill came, I told them that one was very sub- standard. They told me that since I ate it, there was nothing they could do other than give me a dessert.   I have been here so many times and have rarely ever walked away with a small bill. Usually it's been business dinners.   What bugged me was the attitude that I might have lied about the quality because I ate it. They told me that there is no way that they can tell what the quality of the lobster is. That struck me as an odd statement.   The manager also mentioned that all their lobsters are fresh, never frozen yet delivered as tails only.  Who has ever heard of this?  The statement seemed disingenuous based on anything I have ever known about lobster.   Other than this issue, I have usually had a good experience.  It's too bad this has to happen. It's soured me a bit."}
{"text":"Have been to the DC a few times now and every time it has been extraordinary! I am  not from here, but every time I make it down to Phoenix I make the drive out to Chandler for a steak at the DC with my fiance!  Why would you wanna go to a chain and put more money into the big corporations when you can support a family owned restaurant  Maybe its just a midwestern thing, but where I am from, we support our local families!  Our night started out with a warm greeting from the hostess.  We called ahead for reservations and she asked if we wanted to go to our table right away.  We wanted to have a few cocktails first so we decided to start at the bar.  I ordered a Cosmo ($8.00) and my fiance had a glass of wine($6.00).  Drinks were great and priced very reasonably!! Bartender was very professional and friendly.    After we finished our cocktails, we sat at a cute table by the window. Jake our waiter appeared soon after, brought us another round of drinks, and took our food order.  For appetizers we started out with Wisconsin Cheese Curds, of course! For Dinner I ordered the New York Strip Medium rare and my fiance had a Filet medium well.  The cheese curds tasted just like back home in WI - YUM!!   Shortly after finishing our cheese curds, our salads were delivered.  Fresh, crisp and Green! Exactly how a salad should be!  Oh - and its included with your dinner! If you go downtown Phoenix to one of those chains, expect to pay $6-7 alone for your salad!  Now for the best part - the steaks!! Seriously - my NY Strip was one of the best I ever had!  It was cooked to perfection!  16oz - I ate about 3/4 and will have the rest for lunch tomorrow - cant wait!! And the mushrooms that are included with it - my mouth is still watering thinking about them!   My fiance said his filet (8oz) was extremely tender and cooked just right as well! Good job DC - another wonderful dinner!  When it comes to dessert, Tiramisu is my weakness and their homemade tiramisu was to die for!!   As we finished our dinner, Dean the owner (or Dino he goes by I think) stopped by the table to check on us and say hello.   We met him last time we came in. How many times can you say the owner of a place stopped at your table just to say HI and thanks for coming in! You can tell he truly appreciated our business.   Overall, dinner and drinks came out to just a tad over $110 and it was one of the best meals I ever had! (Compare that to like $200 downtown).  I gladly left a 25% tip - Jake was great!   Cant wait for our next visit down south -we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Chandler gem, great steaks chops and seafood! Biggest martinis in the Valley and great service, what a great steakhouse should be. We are from Canada, snowbirds who make it a stop every time we visit."}
{"text":"We went to DC steakhouse for happy hour. I was in from out of town and my aunt and grandma really like this place for happy hour. We got there at 4pm when they opened and we were the first ones there.   It took 10 minutes for a server to come up to our table to take our drink orders. You would have thought they were extremely busy. We had to ask for our server twice. That is my only negative regarding this place. The food on the other hand was really good! I ordered the steak sandwich which was delicious. If I end up going back to DC steakhouse when I'm in town next, I will order this again."}
{"text":"Tasteless and  expensive. $12 fruit plate tastes like plastic. And took 30min to prepare an omelette..."}
{"text":"Great steak, great service.    The desserts really need to be brought to the next level. Our waiter expressed to our table that they were standard and by the looks and tasteless cheesecake. He was correct"}
{"text":"Loved this place, the ambiance was great, food was perfect (steak was highest quality and cooked perfectly) Wine selection was good.  Will recommend DC Steak House to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at DC Steak House!  The staff was friendly.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of food and wine pairings. She was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed when we needed it. The food was very good.  We all ordered our steaks medium and they came out perfectly pink in the middle.  We also had lobster tails and they may have been slightly overcooked, but we all ate every bite! If we lived close, we would be there again!"}
{"text":"The five of us came here last evening for dinner around 6 pm and had a nice time. Downtown Chandler is working very hard at becoming a foodie destination.   The only drawback with our visit to DC Steak House was that they had us sitting in the very noisy bar area. So much for our two week old reservation. LOL It didn't ruin our experience, but it was hard to hear everyone at different times.   We skipped the appetizers, since we heard their desserts were amazing.   Two of us ordered the Salmon Filet, one had the BBQ Ribs, another the Prime Rib (special) and I had the 8 oz Filet Mignon, with two Cajun cooked Shallops (see photos).  All of us felt the food was in the good, to very good range.  Our entrees came with a dinner salad and were in the $24 to $30. My two Scallops, were seasoned just right and very tasty at $6.00 each.   For dessert, we shared their outstanding Chocolate Layer Cake ($9.00) and the Tiramisu ($7.00), which was good and very moist.   The damage came to $190.85 before taxes and gratuities for the five of us. It also included four beers ($18.00), three coffees ($8.85) and a Cappuccino ($5.00) for me. So expect to pay $40 each. Maybe next time we'll be allowed to sit with the grown ups in the dinning room. LOL"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and tried DC Steakhouse after seeing a groupon for the restaurant.  I am sometimes skeptical of groupon offers because I think if the restaurant is good it should not need to discount but in this case I am really glad we tried it!  DC's is located in the historic downtown area of Chandler and had a really nice atmosphere.   The steak was fantastic and the add on lobster was really good.  Our server, Spencer, was very attentive.  Overall we were very happy with the ambiance, quality of food,  reasonable prices for a quality experience and good service.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has horrible customer service standards and policies ! My friend had bought a 4 person  groupon for her sisters bday, and planned on going with her husband, sister, and sisters husband. Her husband passed shortly before the bday dinner, and when the  3 person group showed up, DC Steakhouse refused to honor the groupon because there was no 4th person!! They explained the circumstances, and offered to buy the meal for the absent 4th person, the steakhouse still would not budge. How cold can a company be to refuse service for a group of high paying customers, who had just been put into a devastating position. I would never spend a dime at an establishment with such poor customer relations practices."}
{"text":"We decided to stop into DC Steak House on our trip to Chandler, AZ and had an amazing dinner experience.  Our server, Kristen from LA, was pleasant and attentive and the food was prepared perfectly!  The atmosphere is very inviting and we enjoyed speaking with the hostess as well.  We felt very welcome and would definitely recommend DC Steak House to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"Went to DC Steak House for dinner with my family on a Sunday night.  This place was packed!  I am glad that I had a reservation as people were being turned away.  Getting seated was a bit of an issue.  Two parties that came in after us were seated before us.  I had to speak to the hostess to ensure we got seated.  The food was great we all enjoyed our meals.  What I did not enjoy was a lot of additional charges.  I did not find out the \"small charge\" until the bill arrived and no substitutions are allowed.  So if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable.  Even though they are the same price on the menu  These extra charges increased my daughters meal almost 50% and this is not acceptable.  The food was good but the service issues may prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"Enjoyed another great meal at this place. I go out of my way every time I travel to the Phoenix I have to eat here  Great food, excellent service and atmosphere   I would bring a date or do any business meeting here without thinking about the cost"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday a couple of years ago. It was average at best.  My son and I gave it another chance and the experience was less than average. The Sizzler would have shamed this place. We had reservations and were sat immediately. It all fell apart after that. We got menus, but no wine list. One would think wine sales have huge margins. 10 minutes after we sat down a server appeared and asked us if we had been helped, no. She was kind, brought us a wine list and offered to bring us bread. For the first time in my 58 years a server brought me bread that was cold to the touch.  My water glass was dirty had salt residue as if it had been used as a Margarita glass. My butter knife was water spotted and had an oily sheen. No, I didn't use it. I ordered the ribeye, commonly known as the king of steaks. It came out as ordered, medium rare, but trying to eat it was like I could imagine like wrestling a bear. A cheap ribeye from Fry's would have put this to shame. I rarely complain at restaurants, but this was like shooting fish in a barrel. I am one that eats steak until I pop. I struggled through half of this and stopped.  We asked to have a box to take the unfinished meat home to our dogs. The server came back and told us the manager would comp us for my steak only if we didn't take home the uneaten portion. That only added insult to injury. I love downtown Chandler, but spend your money anywhere other than DC Steakhouse.  I told the server about my concerns"}
{"text":"Only been here one time. Went for my in-laws anniversary. I had the small filet and I have to say it was the most tender filet I've ever had in my whole life. Yes this place is very expensive, but it was delicious. Everyone in our group loved their meal. I can't remember what else I had as I'm making this post months after our visit. One con that I can remember is that the tables I thought were too close together. Made it hard if you needed to get up and go to the bathroom."}
{"text":"While the service was a bit slow, it is worth going to DC Steak House for the food in itself.  It took us 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.  Partly because the staff was elusive and not attentive when we needed them to be.  The restaurant on the other hand should be commended for how clean it is. So clean that the bartenders even smell the glasses before pouring any liquids into them.  That says a lot about the care they take with their patrons.  The food was awesome!  I had a \"medium\" 6 ounce filet mignon that cut like butter.  The baked potato was your average potato nothing wrong, nothing great, just average. Mushrooms are included with their steak preparation.  I do not eat any mushrooms and found it quite easy to maneuver around them so they did not get in my way.  By the way, they do not make soups, so please do not ask then what the soup of the day is.  Their dessert was outstanding!  I had the tiramisu which I could tell was made with real cream that makes such a difference.   Overall if you are looking for great food, this is where you would want to go."}
{"text":"Great food!     Came here with the Family for a birthday dinner.    It was a lovely evening.     Server was nice, helpful and prompt with the ice tea refills.   Which I always appreciate!      Steaks were perfect!    Super tender and flavorful!!     We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We have visited DC Steak House frequently over the past few years, always with good results.  Better than average food and friendly staff.  But the last couple of times we have visited the steaks have been less than tasty.  They were chewy and flavorless,  We were very disappointed,  We did not even attempt to finish the steaks as the baked potato was far more appealing.  The staff was once again friendly and provided great service, but I have to wonder if they switched meat suppliers and went with a less expensive alternative that provided them with lower quality cuts of beef?  I do not mind paying for a quality steak, but to be charged for a premium steak and receive something far less.........I can't do that. We love the location and the staff, but until you guys verify that the steaks are worth the price of admission, we will be trying other dining destinations."}
{"text":"What a disaster.   Do not ever do reservations here.  This place takes our reservation for 10 at 7:30 on Christmas Eve. Our party shows up at 7:20 as expected and are told they are an hour behind schedule. Will do nothing to address the issue, and is almost indignant to the problem.  No other fine dining restaurant would allow this to happen.  Good food, terrible management, will update with progress thru out our experience to update this abortion.  Management has offered nothing for our now 50 minute wait.  Terrible  Finally seated.  Service staff already has appetizers on the table.  Well done  Food was as expected and service was fine.  Do come here if you like good food. Don't come here if you think your reservations mean anything."}
{"text":"DC Steak is a great nice restaurant without having to go in old town or Scottsdale. I consider myself a steak snob when it comes to steak houses and my go to is City Hall Maestros. This place has great steak that i recommend rare Oscar style. They have a good appetizer list with the fried cheese curds. I think this is a little pricey for what it is ( a local steak house) but is a great date night dinner that you don't want to go a long way. Plan on getting a reservation if you are going it is rare to get in without one."}
{"text":"I'm really pissed that I spent so much money here. I went on a weekday for dinner with my two teenage siblings and a baby. We ordered appetizers that took 15 mins for the first one to come out and 30 mins for the second one to come out. The entrees took well over an hour. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me. The calamari was fishy tasting,  the hot wings were not spicy at all but rather way salty and charcoal burnt. My husband ordered the 38 $ filet, I ordered the spaghetti bolognese which for 16 $ I could've gone to cheesecake factory for way better pasta and way bigger servings. The baldish short guy waitor referred to by other yelpers was my waiter and I shit you not, he did not ask if we enjoyed our appetizers, how the filet was cooked or anything. He refilled our waters twice at best. I had to flag him down for my check. Don't treat me poorly based off of my clothes or appearance. This was not a special dinner that I can only afford once in a while, this was a regular evening dinner. My bill was 114 $ for the two of us and the two big kids. As I'm not a b****, I begrudgingly left the 18$ tip which equated to 15%. For service and food that sucked. So disappointed. As other yelpers mention, when your prices are this high, you will be compared to other high end steakhouses. I'd much rather used that money for complete dinner service at Donovan's or hell, even outback would've tasted better."}
{"text":"Had a groupon and wanted to try this place out. We made a reservation so we would be sure to get a table. Service was excellent.  The food on the other hand looked really good but that's as far as it went. There is a chart right on the menu telling you what rare, Med rare etc is going to look like. My husband had the strip steak medium and it was over cooked. I ordered lamb chops medium and it was rare I mean raw. Glad I had the groupon. Don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"We had a great experience for dinner on the patio. Good wine selections, our steaks were cooked to perfection. The service was excellent and even the hostess was so sweet and friendly. The restrooms were very clean as well. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned steakhouse in Downtown Chandler.  The atmosphere is laid back yet romantic and perfect for when you want a nice meal during the week but don't want to drive too far!  The food and service are both wonderful!"}
{"text":"Solid steak. I'd recommend them for a nice cut of beef. The steak only came with 3 teenie mushrooms, so that was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We used a groupon. Everything was superb. My husband is very particular, and he said \"The best meal I've had in a while.\" We had the Steve's shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. They were large in size and very tasty. A wood flavor. Flavorful and good texture. He ordered the rib eye. I ordered the filet tips and lobster tail. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were exactly what they should be - tender, juicy and delicious. The lobster tail was succulent. Probably the best I've had. (I've not been to the east coast.) The salad is good. The bread is brought in from a local bakery - baked fresh every day. Great place! We'll be back!! This will be a special occasion place though, as the prices are a little higher than what we typically pay on a night out. 4 large shrimp = $16. Filet tips and lobster tail = $35. 14 oz Ribeye = $28. The entrees include salad and a side of either fries, sweet potato fries or a baked potato. Bread and butter are also provided. It's a great place, and very enjoyable, we're just typically more frugal - unless we're celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"The salad totally sucked, and the service wasn't great, but the steak was fantastic and made the visit worth it.  Don't put a dirty green cherry tomato on my plate..."}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday night for a late dinner and couldn't be happier with the service, ambiance and the food!  Ordered the swordfish and it was amazing.  Contrary to another review I saw the entree's were reasonable and include a salad and loaded baked potato or other potato option.  The salad was very good as well.  Try it, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"We ate at DC Steak House the first weekend it opened.  We have been consistent patrons for years.  However, we have been increasingly disappointed in our experience over the last 12 months.  It is obvious they have changed food vendors - not the same quality.  Visit before this one we ordered carrot cake \"it is not in season\"....really?  Tonight we sat in view of the kitchen - food consistently sat in the window (while servers waiting on food did not expedite to the waiting tables) - fish sat in the window for 10 min, steak sat in the window for 10 min waiting on a baked potato.....as fast as restaurants turn over in Chandler, if DC Steakhouse doesn't assess  quality and refocus on service, they may not be around to benefit from the new entertainment district under construction to the North."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. 10 ounce New York Strip. Average cut of meat at best. Have had much better off my backyard grill. Ordered medium rare, got a medium well steak.   Service and atmosphere were both nice but I see no need to return for average food at above average prices."}
{"text":"Meh. Not worth the high prices. And they charge $10 to split an entree. The food is ok, but did not blow my socks off.  Service was ok.  There are equally good, or better, places that cost less."}
{"text":"I went to DC Steakhouse Monday evening.  Was seated immediately.  I restaurant never got crowded, but did have a fair amount of business for Monday.  Service was excellent.  Our server was prompt, brought drinks right away, knew the menu very well.  No complaints about service  5 stars.  So my friend ordered the petite filet, and I took the servers advise and ordered the strip.  We both ordered our steaks medium-rare.  I told   the server I was not afraid of rare, and would rather have it more rare than less.  He assured me they cook true rare.   Both our steak came out medium to medium well.  In my mind, unacceptable in a steak house, particularly when I made it clear I wanted it truly pink in the middle.  I should have done like I have to do at Black Angus or Outback and order it rare...and hope i get med-rare.  All their steaks come with sauteed mushrooms on them.  I am not against sauteed mushrooms...but if you're proud of your steak, why would you put mushrooms on top?  My feeling is...they're not proud of their steak.  Sides were very good.  I saw a wedge salad another table ordered and it looked great.  The cocktails were great.  So...not so good steak, hidden in sauteed mushrooms, but very good service and cocktails.    I would not go back for dinner.  I could get the same quality steak cheaper at a chain place, or go to a good steak house and get what I wanted.  I see no reason to go to DC Steak House for a steak."}
{"text":"My sisters and I had dinner Sunday night.  Greeted at the the door by Mandy the hostess with the mostest sets the mood for a very enjoyable night.  After martini's and wine we  were ready for dinner.  By the way, try the kiwi strawberry Lemondrop.  Yum!   Daniel our waiter took care of all our needs without hovering.  We had Lobsters and a bone in ribeye cooked to perfection.  We love to keep our money in our neighborhood and will return often."}
{"text":"It's so nice to see the Downtown Chandler area revitalized and one restaurant that contributes to this is DC Steakhouse.  I have been to DCS numerous times now and each time has been very enjoyable.  I usually get a filet and lobster tail combo which is always perfectly cooked.  The wait staff is always professional and knowledgable.  The ambiance is very nice; a little urban chic.  DCS has a nice bar area and a nice selection of wines and spirits.  DCS is a great place for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.  You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place and we decided to try it on Friday. I was pleasantly surprised! Great service. We tried the calamari and it was good. I had the wedge salad and liked it. Also tried the filet - well done! -  and it was cooked perfectly. My suggestions for improvement would be expanding offerings of wine by the glass (great selections by the bottle --Duckhorn!,), but pretty limited by the glass. Also, desserts - chocolate cake too rich and little cupcake a bit stale. But I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.  Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.  Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.  Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.  Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.  Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.  Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.  Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new \"friends.\"  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews from Trip Advisor, I decided to try this local establishment. We called and left a message for reservations as the restaurant was not open during the day.  My request for the outdoor seating was granted.  We arrived at the restaurant and it was not crowded, but for a Tuesday I think doing just fine.  The waitress was good and explained the meals to us.  The prices here are above average, but that is OK.  I didn't want to go to a chain restaurant.  The appetizer we started with was a Zucchini which was just OK.  Not bad, but OK.  Wouldn't get it again.  The main meals came out and we were surprised.  I had Veal and Lobster and the Lobster was great.  Sweat and tender.  The Veal chop was good, not great.  A bit tough, but flavorful.  My guests all had fish and they all said it was delicious.  When I polled everyone that was there, they all agreed that this needed a second trip and that it was worth the first trip.  I will go again, try a different dish and support the local owner.  You should too."}
{"text":"Well...a lot of old people wearing running shoes and track suits. Not quite sure what that's about. Don't be fooled by the mozzarella and marinara appetizer, it's deep fried cheese sticks. Bread served room temperature (hint: invest in a bread warmer). Caesar salad- No anchovies. Filet- nice grill marks don't make a great steak. Basically flavorless and tastes just like the poor cuts I've bought at area butchers. Grilled shrimp was great but the cocktail sauce it was served with was pretty lame.  Ownership- you really need to take your managers and \"chefs\" on a little trip to some great steakhouses, institutions. Start in San Francisco first and then NY.   Oh, and please source better quality beef. Grass fed tastes so much better than corn fed."}
{"text":"My husband and I were wandering around before the Tumbleweed Christmas Tree lighting and we were hungry!  All the restaurants were packed with parade goers, shoppers, etc.  Of course we were not dressed for the upscale DC Steakhouse...well, we asked and they said they would take us, no problem!  Yes, it was crowded, but they found us a table and we had the yummiest dinner!!  My husband had a steak, which was so tender he could cut it with his fork!  I ordered the steak salad, which was absolutely delicious!!!  The steak pieces were plentiful, very tender and the taste was spectacular!!  The service was friendly, helpful and amazingly fast!  What a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"The good: My fish was excellent! The martinis were shaken perfectly.  Our server was really nice and even offered to write us a list a places to go since we are new to the area.  The bad: Who still makes a house salad with iceberg lettuce?   The ugly: The manager was super cranky when we asked him to snap a quick photos of us."}
{"text":"Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door.  We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon.  They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess.  For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller.  Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the \"child\".  I realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it.  Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance.  The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning.  The server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills.  I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well / well done).  The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back.  Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!!"}
{"text":"This is a special restaurant for me and my boyfriend- birthdays, anniversaries, celebrations- not just our typical Friday night dinner. It's by far our favorite restaurant. We have been to DC steakhouse probably ten times and I have never had a bad meal there.   First of all, whether you sit at a table or at the bar, your going to have awesome service. Not only are all of the waiters and waitresses super attentive and friendly, but I have not once been in and not seen the owner there, clearing tables, running food, making drinks. You know that any restaurant where the owner is there and takes pride in his business is going to be an extraordinary experience.   We always start with the fried mushrooms as an app, and I'm obsessed with the wasabi salad dressing for my dinner salad. But the important part of the meal, the entrees, are what we go there for. My boyfriend always gets the pan fried shrimp with the filet and a lobster tail. He won't even try anything else and he always leaves feeling more full than any normal person should ever feel. I switch it up every time. I've had every type of fish on the menu, the chicken and pasta, the lamb, and the veal. I am not joking when I say I have not had a bad meal. And we very rarely make it to dessert, even on special celebrations.  I recommend this place to anyone in the area, and sometimes they have groupons which make it an extra great deal!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I know everyone really likes this place but I think it's just alright. For the price of the plates, you're really just paying for your typically nice steak place. The atmosphere is very elegant and dark, so it's a great date place and the food is good. But I wasn't blown away by anything here in particular. I've had friends who've said it's the best steak they've ever had, but I disagree. To their credit, my dad makes the best steaks on the planet (with the exception of one place in Park City, UT), so I've been spoiled on real steak all my life!"}
{"text":"Despite some of the other mostly lukewarm reviews (which usually impact our decision to try a new restaurant), we decided to brave it.   After a short 30-minute wait (not bad for a busy Saturday night) we were seated and served drinks promptly. I ordered the first Cabernet on the menu and  (recommended by our uber-cool waiter Gavin) and it was good...in fact they do a pretty good pour.   The interior looks completely different from the 98 South days, but is still really cool with murals of a \"downtown Chandler circa early 1900's with a bit of contemporary flair.\" There is outside patio seating which is fantastic on a spring night.   While many were dressed casually (shorts and golf shirts), this isn't a pub or bar atmosphere. I'd recommend it for a date night or pseudo-nice evening out so dress comfortably but not flip-flops and ripped jeans.  I'm sure the place is fine with kids, but I'd recommend against bringing them unless they're really well-behaved since there's a lot of hustle and bustle.   The bread was warm and fresh.Our salads were also fresh and uncomplicated, and the wasabi cream dressing was really flavorful.  I ordered the filet mignon and my hubby ordered the pike...they were both cooked to order, had great flavor and very tasty! They must have listened to some of the reviews and gotten it together because everything from the service, ambience, apps and entrees were great!   The prices were really reasonable ($24 for a 9 oz. filet, with bread, salad and baked potato.)   Unfortunately we were too full to handle dessert, but we'll definitely be back to try that too.  I'd actually rate DC Steak House 4.5 stars if I could, but Yelp doesn't have that as an option.)  I recommend you check it out and see for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. It's a tight fit in this old building, so conversation can get a little loud, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it! One of our local favorites!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last weekend.  The NY strip was to die for, and the service was excellent!  Only complaint was the noise level."}
{"text":"Yesterday ,will be the last time your cook will serve us under cooked raw fish, with a burnt bottom. This has happened 3 times in the past 2 months. Need to find a new cook, I'm DONE"}
{"text":"When we choose to dine at a steakhouse. We know we will be spending money and our specific group goes to spend money and have a good dining experience. The risk of a steakhouse is if they do it up right. They profit good money by our bill, receive good reviews promoting their Business and receive our return business, (which in the end brings them profit - which is the whole idea of running a restaurant). If The steakhouse falls short in its service and most importantly if they fail to cook a steak as ordered. The price of the steak is on them. - Tonight even after reading the reviews, we decided to give DC Ranch a try. After all 3.5 stars is still decent.  We didn't come to this restaurant to get a discount or to receive free food but if you or your staff screwed up then it is up to you to make the experience right. us your customers can choose where to spend our money and dine else where.    2nd time here. Last time.  This place survives solely on people not knowing better obviously."}
{"text":"We've been to DC Steak House several times and had excellent service and food.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for our experience on Saturday night.  My children took me out for Mothers Day and I ordered the baby back ribs.  I've had them three times previously and they were fall off the bone tender.  This time, they were not tender at all.  In order to eat them, I had to pick them up and chew off the bone.  My daughter got the same ribs and they were as I previously experienced - fall off the bone tender.  I sent my ribs back (I was told that my daughter got the ribs from the \"appetizer portions\" and I got the ribs from the \"main course\" portion - apparently the baby-back ribs are different according to what you order.  My husband and kids were completely finished with their meals when my replacement dinner finally arrived.  I asked to have the dinner boxed up since everyone else was finished and asked what adjustment would be made on the bill.  The \"manager\" said that no adjustment would be made if I took the dinner to-go, but the dinner would be taken off the bill if I didn't take the dinner.  The upshot of the evening was that I didn't get dinner and the manager had no interest at all in whether we returned or not.  It's definitely an \"Or Not\".  Blue 32 has ribs that are far better, cheaper and with great customer service.  We've seen the last of DC Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Out first visit and the service was outstanding. Our server joe was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. He was funny and moved us to a different table so my wife and I could sit next to each other. That was awesome!!!  Drinks and appetizer were really good. They would have gotten 5 stars, but the main course was great. It's quality didn't match the service, atmosphere, or price. It was more like a chain restaurant. They need to step their game up in that arena."}
{"text":"Special occasion Monday night dinner! We started with Shrimp & Crab balls, Caprese and Shrimp cocktail. Caprese was awesome, large thick slices of ripe tomato and mozzarella generously dressed with really good olive oil & balsamic. Shrimp were fresh and large and although they seem a little pricey the quality makes them a great value!  I enjoyed Mama's pasta which was really great! Pasta cooked perfectly, sauce was thick, rich and full of flavor. Swordfish is seriously amazing. We ordered both Cajun and grilled and they were both great!  Tara was a fantastic server and after hearing us talk about loving pepperocinis over our salads brought us a plate of extras without being asked. She was super attentive and casual we didn't feel rushed at all. It wasn't a busy Monday night but we were there for a long time waiting on someone running late.   Atmosphere is comfortable, the historic building is awesome and everyone had a beautiful evening! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I visited for a special date night. The whole experience was good, but the 5 stars is specifically for the ribeye steak. I ordered it medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. Extremely juicy and charred just right. If you go, get the ribeye!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to DC Steak House for our Anniversary and it was mostly a great dinner. Our server was new, so he didn't know certain questions we had but was a friendly young man that tried hard to please us. Make sure you bring bread to the table. lol...  I had the Bone in Ribeye which was very good, but a bit over salted for my taste. I asked for a Medium Rare Steak and it was more like Medium Well, but it was good anyway.  My wife had their 8-ounce, Filet Mignon which she loved.  They gave us a dessert to share complimentary for our Anniversary which was delicious. The prices are a bit on the higher end and I would recommend making reservations since it filled up fast, but it was a Friday night. Thanks DC for the dessert...  Overall, I would go back again and try something else, but it is a steakhouse and they did it right. I do recommend them. :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service and food as well. We ordered shrimp cocktail which never came out but we did get our dinner about a bit more than an hour after we ordered it. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"I love down  town chandler, and this place is a great date spot. My husband and I frequent here when we want a date night, its cozy and has a great atmosphere. The steaks are very good, and for starters try the cheese curds in the wasabi ranch... amazing! I am a fan of this place and will continue to go back. Its a bit pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"There were four of us who decided last minute to go out for dinner. We wanted to try a restaurant that we had never been to before. On a Saturday night at 6 p.m. we arrived at D.C. Steak House. They were already filling up and had many reservations. The hostess was kind enough to work things out to accommodate our party. From the moment that we met the hostess and the minute we paid our bill we had an enjoyable dinner with delicious food, outstanding service and friendliness from every employee we encountered. The steak and prime rib was fabulous. My husband and friend each has fish entrees. One was walleye and the other was an evening special. They were both delicious as well. I highly recommend D.C. Steak House and encourage you to make a reservation. We were so lucky that the hostess went out of her way to get us in. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Mixed review: A group of 10 of us went over to DC last weekend to celebrate a friend's new job. It was nice that we were able to get a reservation by leaving a message, but then upon arrival they were missing a seat- but they fixed that quickly.  The place was VERY loud, not sure if that's because of the set up (everyone all piled into a huge room) or the acoustics of the place but it reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria. The rather dark lighting did make it seem fancy despite the noise.  Our server was pretty quick, but she did skip getting my husband's drink order- but he's a calm guy so he didn't care all that much. She could have been friendlier...she was slightly older than all of us and instead of acting like we were her guests she was more like an annoyed mom. We're all in our mid to late 30s but we were definitely treated like kids (we were not acting like kids that night).  The food= superb!  Everyone agreed that the taste of their steaks was amazing, all steaks were cooked exactly as requested. The table got free bread and the salads were brought out before the entree.  We had separated some of the checks since it was a larger group, but when it came time to get the bills....somehow my bill had both bottles of wine that a group of 5 of us shared. Not sure how it was decided to put BOTH bottles on my tab, I most certainly didn't request or agree to this, but the strange part is, I didn't even order them!  Usually if there is a shared item it goes on the tab of the person who ordered it, or the server asks the group who wants the bottles, etc. Now, because I don't struggle with money I didn't actually mind paying for the bottles, but I would have liked not to have them forced upon me....they were $40 each, so I had $80 added to my tab when no one else did. Sure, I could have mentioned this to her, but then I would like like a jerk to the group or as though I'm complaining about paying- so instead of feeling humiliated, I stayed quiet and paid. However- now I'm not going back to this place. I'm big on integrity and that was a jerky move."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6 at DC steakhouse. We arrived at 6:01 didn't get seated until 645. The weather was amazing and they put us outside. This normally would have been awesome but they seated us in super cheap folding chairs that my 105 lbs cousin said was sagging. I had walking boot and a cane and am of a larger carriage so I am sure you could guess how comfortable I was.   I ordered the shrimp cocktail which was $20 for 4 shrimp. Shrimp was ok. Cocktail sauce was amazing. Our table also ordered cheese curds, and calamari. The calamari was cheap and shockingly generic. The cheese curds were VERY good. The iced tea is terrible, tastes like coffee grounds. Lemonade which I switched to was much better.   After apps came salads which were awesome. Joe our server (who was awesome) recommended I get the house peppercorn with blue cheese crumbles and it was AMAZING. served nice and cold.   Our meals came out next and I had the bone in ribeye which was no joke better than any I have have anywhere in the valley. Better than Flemings, Ruth's, Mastros. Cooked perfect. My wife is not a huge steak fan but she is now because of their filet. She ordered it well (unfortunately) but it was still tender and flavorful as can be. Our sides were shoestring potatoes which I would pass on next time.   With the food being so good we still may not go back due to the top portion of this review. If you love makeshift seating, terrible iced tea, overpriced appetizers but really good steaks and salads check this place out."}
{"text":"Lori and Dino-always enjoy dining here-great food, service and atmosphere! The decor with the murals on the walls lends a nice touch to the dining experience. It's a little bit of a drive in from Phoenix, but well worth it. I love it that you always cater to  my vegan diet...my dinner was absolutely delicious. My non-vegan table mates are always pleased with the quality of their entrees as well. Will be back soon! Your establishment is a nice addition to Downtown Chandler...keep up the good work! ;)"}
{"text":"Dc steakhouse deserves 7 stars out of 5! Porterhouse steak with shrimp asparagus and hollandaise was outstanding! Restaurant was clean and pristine and our server was amazing!

{"text":"We just got married yesterday and had our dinner at DC Steakhouse. My husband and I just wanted to say thank you for everything!!! The food and service was over and above our expectations. It's not easy taking care of a party of 14 on a busy Saturday might but your staff did amazing. Thank you for helping us make our big day a special one. Can't wait to come have dinner again soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place. Not amazing. Not the best ever. It's good. The service last night was just average. She had a hard time keeping our water and other drinks full but that's acceptable I guess. When I think of steak houses I just think of something different. I think of way better cuts of meat and better cooking techniques."}
{"text":"Our first visit was outstanding,  our second was the complete opposite.  I rated in the middle."}
{"text":"Wow what a great dinner. We wanted to try a new place and I'm so glad we did!! The rib eye was so good and we did the special filet mignon with lobster tail and it was sooo good. Make sure you get a reservation!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Steakhouse !! One of the best in AZ hands down!!  Delicious food and the service is on point!!!  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Great place ! Great staff ! The food is so tasty and came out hot and server timed everything perfect. Our steaks came out the perfect temperature and my husbands lobster was amazing. They were busy dealing with a guest that was rude and acting like a grown adult child. I saw he made a review on here  but neglected to say his behavior was very inappropriate how he conducted himself to server and manager. You all do a great job at the DC and my Husband and I will make sure to spread the word in Chandler! Keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"We have been to DC several times over the last three years and the experience has lessened each time.  We started with the shrimp cocktail which a year ago was jumbo, ice cold and served in a martini glass. Now, 4 small shrimp we could purchase from Costco and a side of cocktail sauce. Next up, Dole bag salad and canned black olives. I figured that was the worst until I realized the mashed potatoes were instant and the ribeye was tough and similar to what I would buy from a local grocery store. The staff was amazing but the food quality will never be worth the amount you spend out of pocket or on your local groupon."}
{"text":"What a joke. Overpriced bland food. I ordered a 10 oz Strip and it was tough as nails, bison might actually be softer. Now normally in most establishments when you order a main meal it should come with a side or a salad. Well guess what. I was charged $4 for a side and $4 for a salad which tasted like raw seaweed. The mash taters tasted a day old and there was no amount of spice or garlic that made them taste any better. I've been to classier steakhouses and none of them were such a complete waste of money like this one. And don't charge extra for regular sides. If you do so please inform the customer that they are buying the steak and the sides are extra. Service was good though, hence the only star I'm giving this place."}
{"text":"Hello Fellow Yelpers,  I apologize in advance for the length of this review.  BUT I now understand the statistics I recently heard from Anthony Bourdain...93 percent of restaurants fail due to service and management...not the food or location.   I lead two Meetup groups with over a hundred members....I bring folks from both groups and my company to DC despite some minor issues with their food. That stops now.  Their host/manager has been repeatedly rude and unprofessional to my clients and group members...last poor experience was tonight...an older, shortish, balding man who thinks he holds the key to Bukingham Palace (night of 5/31 was last experience with him). He needs to be replaced, DC owners...he will continue to drive away your loyal customers.  On the bright side, tonight we decided to simply leave and go to Vintage 95...amazing, fantastic experience....my large foodie network and I have now moved on to better places.   Goodbye DC...I was a major advocate for you...no longer."}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the last few months and over the years and had decent meals in the past.  WATCH OUT FOR THE BAIT AND SWITCH ON WINE!! The Rib-eye steak was awful and the service is horrible. If you want to over pay for a bad meal and CHEAP wine  go to DC Steak House.  The Owner must not care to keep regular customers because he hired an incompetent manager You cant miss him ( Meat Head) .  STAY AWAY!!!! Really we are all seniors had a table of 7 and could not believe how BAD this place has gotten. We use to love the place but now NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I'm a little hesitant to write this review after only one solo visit, but it's a new place so here goes:  Service:  My server was as good as a server can be.  She was knowledgeable about the menu and the actual food preparation.  She didn't chat me up, but she got everything done.  I was there late on a weekday and she never gave me that feeling that she would rather be doing her sidework and getting home instead of dealing with a single bum like me.  Food choice: The menu is pretty complete.  It's not cheap, but they include salad, bread and very nice choice of potatoes.  After the last places here, this is a nice change.  They serve walleye (WalleyePike actuallY) and it was pretty good, pan-fried with flour (LIKE IT SHOULD BE!).  For those of us from the Canadian-influenced parts of Midwest, this is a nice find.  There was something about the preperation though that wasn't like I remember it.  Maybe it's because they used olive oil instead of butter or too much of it or cooked it too long.  It was good, but not great.  Bar: The bar crowd seemed like the young professional crowd.  The thing that made my night was the fact that they had Campari, which is sort of my drink.  If they have that, I'm guessing they have a pretty good selection, because most non-Italian places don't stock Campari.  Ambience: I was there at 9:30 on a Tuesday, so it's hard to say.  The room is nice, a little different than before.  There is a little bit of an effort to partition out the bar which is a nice touch I suppose.  For now, I'll give it a tentative four stars, definitely not five.  I need to go back to confirm, but I'm not afraid to by any means.    Bottom line: $19 walleye with bread, salad and beautiful baked potato + Damn good service + Campari == Four stars.  For now."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. Very nice environment, and great service! Ordered the filet - it was nothing special, but all together was a nice experience. Weird to see cheese curds on the menu at a steakhouse. But ok!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and the food and service are always excellent. I wanted to give a shout out to Mandi & Jeff for taking such great care of us the other night. Great drinks. Great dessert. Ask Jeff for the panty dropper chocolate cake :)"}
{"text":"I expected my steak to be cooked perfectly medium and it was medium rare, not to mention it was burnt! How is that even possible?! I do not recommend this place especially for the price, my steak was charred, I ate 1/5 of it. Also my salad was basic that came along with the meal, nothing special at all and the bread came out cold. Not to mention the service was slow. The only reason why I gave it a star was because our waitress was nice even though it took forever to get our food out, but the food was not on point. Go to Donovan's instead please!!! Trust me! I am a steak lover and I felt scammed!"}
{"text":"To celebrate my sons birthday, we decided to try DC Steakhouse. Nice atmosphere & we had a great waitress who made us feel welcome & took care of us. I had the 10 oz NY Strip which was seasoned & cooked a perfect medium. Had the loaded baked potato & they brought me a bowl of bacon, chives, cheese, sour cream, & butter so I was able to load it just right.  My son had the 14oz Ribeye & it was cooked a perfect medium rare but needed a little more seasoning.  Nice dinner & evening wish we had tried this place long ago we will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and originally went here after meeting the owners Dino and his wife(I don't recall her name right now) while golfing several years  ago. The first time was a great experience with excellent food and service. Despite the higher prices, we kept going back as it was a much better choice than the other steak places around. We loved to bring our out of town guests and other friends in and show it off. It was always great! We even celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary there. Last night we brought some old friends here who had moved back to Gilbert after being in Oregon for the past 20 years. Wow, what a disappointment it was. The service was very slow, we had to keep trying to track down our server to get drinks, ask for water, etc. We all ordered steaks, however 2 of the 4 were over cooked and it took several minutes to get our waiter to come back as he never came by to see how the steaks were. Our waiter took our steaks reluctantly and it was another 20 to 25 minutes before we received our new order. The other people in our party were already finished eating before we received our steaks. The ribeye was not good quality despite being a $30 steak. We were not happy and asked to see the manager. Instead they sent us the cook who made all kinds of excuses and tried to reason that he had no control over the quality. To top it off, after another long wait, they bring the bill and took $13 off a $261 bill. The waiter was very smug and didn't seem to care. We will not being going back."}
{"text":"It was okay. Calamari, fries, and mushrooms were good, drinks were good, but the steaks were choice cuts, not prime cuts despite the price being scaled up high. Steaks were also cooked wrong where medium rare was more like medium, medium was more like medium well, and medium well was more like well-done. When we told our server, he acted like he knew what the standard ranges were and wrongly tried to explain to us blue, rare, and medium rare were. It seemed like there were 2 cooks for a filled restaurant and 7 wait staff. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I eat here somewhat regularly and it is always consistent. They prepare some of the best steaks I've eaten; thick, juicy, and tender. Prices are reasonable, plates include salad and potato option. Vegetables are a la carte.   Good ambience, friendly and prompt service, and happy hour available."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and never a bad experience. Best steaks in the area, always cooked to perfection and top notch service."}
{"text":"I will Never make late night reservations here again. The food was good but my wife felt rushed and the staff in the back seemed very displeased that we came in that late."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing!!! I ordered the ribs and chicken and it was seriously the best meal I have had in for ever!! My boyfriend also enjoyed his ribeye. We used a groupon and it was a great deal 50 for 80 dollars worth of food. The service was also good, but we will be returning for the food let me tell you. I had such a good date night!!!:) yummmm"}
{"text":"D.C. Steakhouse is my favorite downtown Chandler restaurant. Food is amazing!!  I'll Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I celebrated a special occasion and chose DC Steak House. We were very pleased with our meals. The bread served prior to our meals was so good. The service was excellent. In fact, one person in our group went back the very next day with her family. She said it was, again, a great experience."}
{"text":"Classy joint!  Took my wife there on Saturday night.  The atmosphere was casual but you wouldn't be out of character if you dressed up a bit.  Centered in the newly constructed down town Chandler, where you can walk around and enjoy yourself before dinner.  There were plenty of food portions to choose from.  Any where from 6oz up to 20oz as far as steak was concerned.  Other choices include pork, and chicken dished.  You can get the most bang for your buck there:  You get a salad, cooked mushrooms, and a choice of loaded potato or sweet potato fries.  My only complaint was that the salads were made of iceberg lettuce not anything fancy.   Dessert was good too.  We ate a cheese cake and we had the option to choose from raspberry, strawberry, caramel or chocolate sauce.  We choose all four and the cheese cake looked like a rainbow thanks to the suggestion of our waitress.    Over all, food was good to great, and we got the most bang for our buck then we would have going to most other steak houses.  Paleo Watch:  If you eat a Paleo type of diet this place is very easy to maintain your diet."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always come away with the same feeling......poor service and overpriced food for the quality.  Tonight it took 15 minutes to order drinks. We had to ask for bread 3 times to get it.  My son ordered surf and turf. The filet was very good but the lobster was over cooked. My sirloin was average. I could have gotten the same steak at any of the 2$ chains.   Doubt I'll come back. The quality and service don't justify the prices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If I still lived in AZ I would make this a usual stop. I recommend this for a date night. You will earn some brownie points."}
{"text":"Kind of saw that it was 3.5 stars and thought a new experience would be nice.  WOW! wrong it was an experience I will not be doing again.  Ordered the Prime Rib (Special for Saturday NIght) very tough and lots of fat.  Ordered Medium and it was more rare.  Using a serrated steak knife to attempt to cut the meat it was more of tearing the meat.  Good taste but poor quality meat.  The shrimp pan fried on the other had was excellent.  If the owners really want this to be the go to steak house they've got some work ahead; both the product being served and the service.  While I saw some excellent service at the table next to us, the service that we received was ok to fair at best.  There appeared to be a gentleman that was either manager or owner but only stood in the door and not once did I see him mingle with the guest.  I wish he had I would have love to share my feed back with him if he was either the afore mentioned.This place at best is a want to be fine steak house."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and each time was a special treat, right up to our last experience . Excellent Service as always (even though there was a minor accident involving some salad dressing) So to begin, we were seated immediately (Nice when you have a reservation). We ordered drinks and everything seemed to be going perfect. Table at the front window, drinks we ordered our food......I ordered the Rib-eye and a baked potato. The Steak was 1/3 fat and my medium order came out almost tar-tar. The potato was cooked to perfection and the server did an excellent job insuring everything service wise was good. I must add that they serve Iced Tea from the bar gun so lets just say horrible and leave it at that. In my last review I spoke of great quality, I must unfortunately down grade my previous rating regarding the quality of the food and continue to rave about the service....... I did receive a gift certificate from friends who we brought to the steak house on a previous occasion so I will be back to use that. But I'll be on the look out for a different steak house to rave about and hopefully that wont take long to find...Or maybe they'll fix this one.......We can only hope! What restaurant that cares about quality would serve instant Iced Tea that tastes like dishwater....."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars if the service was better. We love to frequent locally owned restaurants that are not big chains.  The last 2 times we have been here, the service was very poor. It seems this restaurant under staffs. Different Servers, female last time, male the most recent experience. We enjoyed our food,  steaks seasoned well, shrimp fresh, vegetables cooked to our liking, the sauteed mushrooms, were not good & we all like mushrooms, don't know what they do to these but the flavor, in our opinion, was terrible. Our most recent visit,  our waiter, was flippant, over busy, not friendly, took a while for us to get noticed, the hostess was even unaware. Our Server picked up a plate, dropped a fork on the table and a red sauce splattered all over the table almost on one of the guests, he didn't apologize or come back to clean up the mess, we cleaned it up. When questions or concerns, they weren't addressed well - he simply had a bad attitude. The experience before this one was very slow service, forgetfulness, no attention to refills on coffee or tea, felt as though we were a left over table. We sat in the middle of the room and it was very loud, better off sitting against a wall or near the window or outdoors if the weather permits. Don't know that we will be back shouldn't have to feel like an unwanted guest when we are paying to have a good meal & would like to have good & friendly service."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place!  My fiance brought me here on a weeknight a couple weeks ago.  We are still new to Chandler and trying out new places.  This is hands down my fave so far.  We sat outside on the patio. The music was old school Sinatra etc.  It was great.  I highly suggest for daters.  The service was excellent.  The food phenomenal.  I has the filet and it was the best most flavorful I have ever had.  I will admit most times is probably because I order medium well ( sorry, I like my meat cooked ) but again the best I have had.  I had a baked potato and salad also that were both very good as well.  My fiance had the ribeye that he thought was great.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome find! Just out exploring old town Chandler with my wife. Great food,  great ambiance, our server Kristin was phenomenal, she deserves a raise. Congrats on you engagement!!!"}
{"text":"DC Steakhouse has become my  favorite hangout since I moved to AZ, over a year ago.  The steaks are wonderful, it's small and intimate but can accommodate large groups (make reservations though!) they are very popular.  While they are on the pricier side, their weekday happy hour till 6pm with $5 martinis and excellent appetizers (also half price) has me going back more often than I care to admit.   Their staff is very friendly and go there often enough, they call you by name :-)"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would, finally a place that gets it right from the service to the food, the music, real table clothes.  This place was truly a joy to dine at."}
{"text":"I'm honestly starting to give up on customer service, tonight I was with a large group of individuals for a medical rep meeting and I'm actually embarrassed for this steakhouse. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and it was served well done plus....grey throughout.....of which I promptly sent back, and then was served after everyone had been done eating including my colleagues and staff, a completely rare steak, cold in the middle and was still charged for the meal, $44.  In my line of business, this is not only absurd but completely unacceptable. The management and or chef clearly do not care about return patrons or customer service.  If the kitchen staff and or chef Cannot figure out how to cook a proper steak at a Midwest-based steakhouse, I'm not sure what they are proficient at. Offering me an $8 dessert as an apology is literally laughable. I've spent a fair amount of money here on my team, my staff and with pharmaceutical reps but tonight it ends."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the 2nd time ever this past Friday, was one of those end of workweek days where you just need a stiff drink.   Sat down at the bar and started talking with the bartender, Jeff. He was hands down one of the best bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of being around. He was so friendly and welcoming and knowledgeable is an understatement. Not just knowledgeable about all things bar related (he actually knew what a Stinger was when I asked about Crème de Menthe White and Courvoisier)-but we also did general trivia with him for a over an hour-I wouldn't recommend challenging him, you'll most likely lose.   As for the bar itself, absolutely love the atmosphere. The decor on the walls, dark wood, and the music being piped in make it seem like exactly the place the Rat Pack would have found themselves.   Didn't have any food this time, I'll update when I stop in for food. Everything we saw looked good, but we had just come from dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service... I think it was a bad night for them.  We arrived 15-20 minutes before our reservation, they were busy, and I was afraid we would have to wait. To my surprise, we were seated right away. Unfortunately, we were also forgotten right away.  I noticed that the tables surrounding us were being served by the manager, instead of by a waiter. This is never a good sign. After comically sitting at our table for close to 45 minutes without even a glass of water, I saw the hostess chase down the manager and point to us. A waiter showed up shortly after.  After some apologies, we made a drink order. We were more than prepared to order our meals too, but the waiter seemed to want to do every thing in micro stages.  First the water, then come back for wine, then come back for bread, then come back to take order..., it was rather silly, I just wanted some damn meat!  Anyway, when the food did come, it was delicious. Too bad it didn't come out until almost 2 hours after we arrived.  A table next to us was in the same boat, and didn't take it as well as we did, and got their meals comped, and I think the girl almost left in tears (I think she was tired and starving).  So yeah, 3 stars might be a little generous, but I'm sure with proper staffing (I choose to believe half the wait staff called in sick) it could be bumped up a notch or two.  Kudos to the hostess who noticed we were being ignored, and who also cleared our table as we waited (and waited) for the check. I'm sure that's not quite in her job description."}
{"text":"Ambiance overwhelms the food quality of the restaurant. My wife ordered the Shrimp Caesar salad and only received 4 shrimp for $26. The sautéed mushrooms included with steak entrees is misinformation, only included 3 mushrooms. The service was polite but very slow. The bottle of wine was the highlight of dinner. In the end, I would never recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Two words: Cheese Curds.   A few more words: I got the pan fried walleye. Something I'm not used to seeing on the menus in Arizona and they nailed it. I ordered it panfried and it was perfect.   This place is one of our date night favorites!"}
{"text":"The manager is a joke. She argued with our table over a $10 split charge. She wasn't offering us anything additional for that fee other than an extra plate. On top of that, she told us it was a 30 minute wait. However, there was an empty table that she just \"forgot\" about. It was far too long of a wait for the quality of food and service. If you are thinking of dining here, think again."}
{"text":"Prologue: Following a truly wonderful New Years Eve performance by the Phoenix Symphony, my fiancee and I found ourselves in search of a nice place to have a late dinner. We did not have any specific plans and, after spending a few minutes discussing our options, my fiancee suggested we have a look around downtown Chandler. After a stroll around Chandler Park we settled on this restaurant, which was more our style and, therefore, more inviting than most of the other establishments nearby.   The Plot: We started by sharing a order of Onion Rings (primarily because I just happened to be in the mood). That was followed by the Lobster & Turf entree, which consisted of a garden salad (with blue cheese dressing and crumbles), a broiled lobster tail, and 8oz filet mignon, thin cut french fries for my fiancee, and a baked potato for me.   The Scene: We were delighted to be seated immediately upon arriving despite not having made reservations on New Years Eve. We had a cozy side table for two fairly close to the front of the restaurant where it was less crowded and more comfortable. The atmosphere was quite festive yet refined, rather than debaucherous, which made for a nice continuation of an evening that began at the symphony.  Service was quick, prompt, courteous, and plentiful.  The appetizer and salad were both very good, plenty for the two of us, and succeeded in getting us in the mood for our entree.  The portion sizes for the entree were perfect for us as well.  We ordered the steak medium rare, however and it was prepared closer to rare although not a bit bloody, which was perfectly fine with us because it was more tender and flavorful that way. The lobster tail was nicely presented and properly seasoned for surf & turf.  The sides were both spot on with plenty of butter, sour cream, and chives for the baked potato.  The Rest of the Story: A standard up-charge was applied for sharing the entree, however it was well worth it because we were served considerably more food than a single diner would have been.  The lobster was just a little overcooked, however plenty of melted butter made up for it.   Epilogue: My perspective on New Years Eve dinner is that it is more of an experience than an meal and this restaurant delivered exactly what we were looking for that night.  The food on its own deserved 3 stars; however the availability of a table on short notice with no wait along with the great service warranted another star."}
{"text":"So, I tried to go here last night with my mother and daughter...we walk in and its 5:45 on Tuesday. Yes, there were people eating but there were also plenty of open tables. The hostess asks if we have a reservation and I let her know that we do not as its a TUESDAY (not really prime eating out day..) and its 5:45! She then informs me that they are totally booked for the evening with reservations. So, I really felt like she didnt care that we were here to spend our money and I felt like she was rude. She offered no help nor did she even try to accomodate us. That's fine by me...we just went to The Keg and spent our money there :) Which by the way was DELICIOUS and I will NOT be going back to DC."}
{"text":"The food has always been quite good, including this last time. However, what marred the last visit was the amount of waiting for all the items ordered. The waitress was very nice, but got a little defensive when the hint was dropped that the service was slow. Just because the restaurant was short-staffed, is no excuse for not letting your patrons know that up front so that the expectations can be adjusted. It took 2.5 hrs to have a complete meal. At least 4 stars for the food, but less than 2 stars for service."}
{"text":"Excellent downtown Chandler steakhouse. Much better value, and in my opinion better steak, than Flemings. Filet is excellent and comes with salad and side, great price for around $25. Still not the steak you would get at Ruth Chris but then again its half the price."}
{"text":"The food here was stellar. Also, the staff was very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating. It's definitely worth the price tag. One thing I didn't like was that they wouldn't let us eat our friend's birthday cake there. We could bring it in but not cut and eat it. Other than that, great place for a great meal/dining experience."}
{"text":"5/12/16  I've considered checking out this place for awhile now.  Somehow seeing the restaurant featured on Check Please! Arizona made me want to go there LESS... Not because of the episode featured, but because every time a restaurant gets a TV mention, its menu prices go up!  Anyway, I'd made previous plans to meet a friend at nearby Peixoto Coffee to catch up on news with her before heading over to the MAC to see Alton Brown's show, when I realized that our meeting time coincided with the coffee shop's closing time, so forget that-- we will have to meet another day (it's complicated), and so it came the time for me to try happy hour at DC Steak House...  I walked in and almost walked out, because it's so dark in there, and it's only 5:50 pm!  Then I realized that this is almost standard in steak restaurants, as the goal is to have people stay and spend lots of moolah, and it's scientifically-tested that dim lighting depresses inhibitions, and voila!  Very dark steakhouses.  I shimmied over to the bar and replied hello to bartender Eric when he came 'round and introduced himself.  What would I like to drink, he asked?  I said I'd have to look over the menus first, because what I'm going to drink depends on what I'm going to eat, but may I have a glass of iced water, please?    HH food menu: https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yhNuQT1QUqS67IU1djO9lQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA HH drink menu: https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LFw1LfZnS_W4cqlZBjViMA&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Turns out that the happy hour menu contains only seven items- five sandwiches and two appetizers.  I asked Eric which of the two sandwiches would he recommend, the Pork Chop (orig. $15), or the Open-Faced Steak (orig. $13)?  Without skipping a beat, he said the steak, so the steak it was.  (This was before I had a chance to peruse the dinner menu.)  I did ask how it's presented, and he said \"sliced steak on toasted bread, with choice of fries.\"  \"That's it?,\" I asked.  He said yes.  \"No sauce?\"  \"Nope, just plain steak.\"  I chose the sweet potato fries.  All of the HH items come with beverage recommendations and the house wines featured, at $6 a glass, are from Nathanson Creek.  I remember being able to try samples of the two house reds- a cab and a merlot, and since it's rare for me to find a merlot that I like, I most likely went with the cab.  (It's only been thirteen days since I visited, but a lot has happened in these days!  Paletas Betty, Alton Brown, YSB:SD, arriving back into this heat and back to work, hello?!)  I sipped on my wine and checked on San Diego bookmarks while I waited for my sandwich.  I'd say it was around 6:20 pm when my sandwich arrived, but wait!  Are those mushrooms I spied on my plate, touching the sweet potato fries and the bread?  I called Eric over and with embarrassment told him that I can't have mushrooms (I'm allergic).  I'd asked how the sandwich would be presented, because I wanted to know what items were going to be on the plate.  There was no mention of mushrooms, and that's why I went ahead and ordered it.  As I waited for the second fire, I overheard the convo at the kitchen window when the manager called out for an open steak sandwich w/o bread and fries, but Eric was quick to tell him that no, he'd need a new sandwich plate and fries, but made WITHOUT mushrooms... Oh, boy, did I feel so sheepish, and all because I didn't know that all dinner menu steak items included sautéed mushrooms!  So glad that Eric had understood what I needed!  It seems like there were a few regulars sitting at the bar with me, and a couple had really kind words to say about him!    The corrected plate finally arrived (another ten minutes, so I know everything was made fresh!), and it was delicious! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TgPUvH5QpsgiTJb00Af03w&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Glad to see there weren't any sauces poured on, just slices of steak (can't recall which cut) on buttered toast slice and cinnamon-dusted crispy sweet potato fries.  Terrific dish, and all for $7!  The wine complemented the steak deliciously.  Plan to return and try the Pork Chop sandwich soon.  Next stop, Paletas Betty! Review coming forthwith-ish... ;)  p.s. Dark restaurants tend to make me draw inwards, especially when I'm dining alone.  I find myself chatting more with strangers at bars when the mood is livelier and I have more light to enjoy.  While my experience here was overall a good one, I hesitate to return anytime soon.  Maybe with a friend, or three..."}
{"text":"I've been to DC Steak House about 5 times now, and will continue coming back when I'm in town.  They have a nice location in \"downtown\" Chandler.  Parking can be a bit challenging at times, but I suppose that is all part of the \"downtown\" experience.  DC has a fairly limited menu, but they always have a few specials to supplement the menu.  The quality of the food is quite good, and matches the prices well.  They know how to cook a steak, no doubt about that.  You'd think that would be a must for any restaurant claiming to be a Steak House, but it's not always the case.  The side dishes compliment the main course well, and they have a nice beer and wine selection.  Service has always been good and relatively quick, even with a large group.  If you live in the Chandler area, or are visiting, DC is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Didn't plan on eating here for dinner but glad I wandered in. Beautiful restaurant. The steak was perfect, the sides were good but nothing spectacular. Bar, high top tables, and traditional tables make it less formal."}
{"text":"DC Steakhouse is a gem, tucked away in Old Town Chandler. My filet was hands down the best steak I've had in the Phoenix area--in fact it may have been the best steak I've had anywhere! It was cooked to perfection, seasoned just the right amount to enhance the flavor, and cut-with-your-fork tender. Plus, the service was excellent despite the packed house. The only drawback was that it was a bit noisy, but that was a testament to the delicious food and otherwise charming atmosphere.  They had plenty of patrons and all seemed as happy and satisfied as my table!"}
{"text":"The. Food was good but too expensive and it was very full. Was advised to call for a reservation."}
{"text":"Horrible sorry just horrible... I eat out a lot the ribeye was very bad tendons running through it and all. Expected much more after being told it was good. Good thing the lighting is so dark in there because I didn't know why my 8 year old wouldn't eat her ribs until I got home and found the pork ribs were raw in the middle. Never again, pray she doesn't get sick tonight..."}
{"text":"Great place, great steaks. Only complain I have is that they need to serve their steaks on hotter plates. The steaks get cold too fast."}
{"text":"Had a groupon and had to try this place out. Jake was our server and he was excellent. We were very pleased, spouse had a ribeye, was a little fatty but good. I had king crab legs, good but I've had better. Cocktails were excellent too."}
{"text":"DC you've wooed me back and made it to the top of my A list. How'd you do it?  let's go over the details. First, I felt like a steak and a place were I could walk around, maybe even have after dinner drinks at another establishment or at your bar and listen to live music, your location fit the bill. We arrived on a Saturday night, and you were jumping, tables were filled, staff was bustling. The hostess was gracious, told us she would get us a table right away, and she was dressed to impress. I like it when I go to a restaurant and the hostess, dresses like she is dressed to invite you to a great party, nice touch . Once seated, our waiter came right over. Perfect,professional, attentive. Cocktail time, I ordereda sidecar, a personal favorite, but not always well known by bartenders. Yours turned out perfect. So, with cocktail in hand, I went straight to the menu. The menu and prices have changed since I was last in. I found it very affordable, so affordable, I added the lobster tail ad grilled asparagus to my order.  My meal was fantastic. I loved the filet, my sides, the dinner salad. It was all great. The only wrinkle was my waiter's lack of knowledge about wine. I had a few questions and she did her best but it was clear,it was not an area of the menu she was familiar with.  Overall, I had a great Saturday night. A band played in the bar, while I ate. My husband I had a great date night and I got to dress up, while he threw on a clean shirt, we both fit right in and really enjoyed ourselves. Thanks DC, your changes are great, your interior improvements are lovely and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous night here enjoyed a fabulous meal and wonderful drinks.  Check out the DC Style with asparagus and shrimp, so good! Service was amazing and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came into this place with low expectations... But left highly satisfied.   I was part of an 11 person party celebrating a birthday on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was surprisingly busy - tables full, lounge full, servers hustling around with drinks and plates. It was fairly loud, but not to the point of being uncomfortable.   The place is well decorated, dark, and not overly large. The bar/lounge looked like a good place to hang out and watch a game. The tables were clean and the chairs were comfy.   The food:  I had looked at the menu online and was not overly impressed with the typical steakhouse grub.  There was no mention of what grade of steaks they served - which usually means no Prime - and I noticed all entrees came with a salad and potato - I thought I was in for a glorified Applebee's type experience.  Because of these low expectations, I actually ordered a pork chop instead of a steak.  The food came and I proceeded to digress...  All the steaks - filets, rib-eyes, sirloin - looked to be cooked perfectly and the filet I tasted was amazingly tender - definitely Prime grade(why they don't advertise this is beyond me).  My pork chop was totally on point - not on par with Houston's Double Chop that's served to you while angels are singing - but I loved it.    Portions were very generous.  Price was acceptable - 11 people - under $400.  Parking sucks - be prepared.  Go for it!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was below average for a steakhouse who's menu and pricing would be considered comparable to a Flemings, Durants etc. We started with a weakly poured vodka tonic and some calamari (small portion) which was just \"ok\". A lettuce wedge followed and  the lettuce was brown and wilted opposed to being fresh and crisp. For the main course we both had the 14 oz ribeye and it was very good. Properly cooked, decent cut of meat and nicely seasoned. Steamed veggies and a loaded baked potato were chosen for our sides and they were ok, however, the baked potato does not exactly arrive at the table \"loaded\". They were kind enough to let you do it yourself. (And if you do, I would skip adding the \"Bacos\".)  We realized that our waiter had not brought our bread to the table and politely asked for a basket. He came back with a couple of small pieces and said \"Sorry, we're almost out of bread.\"  We didn't stick around for desert. Overall, I would consider this to be an average AT BEST experience and would most likely not return."}
{"text":"My husband I decided to give this place a try to celebrate his birthday. First we ordered the calamari which was super tasty and the helping was generous. We ordered the ribs and chicken, the chicken was moist and flavorful, the ribs however were a disappointment. They were dry and very bland, we only ate half of the serving and decided not to take the remainder home. Overall this place was pretty good, I would be willing to give it another try, minus the ribs."}
{"text":"I went here on a date and expected it to be an upscale steakhouse, boy was I disappointed:( First thing I noticed as we walked in was the size, really tiny... And they pack in the tables so everyone is sitting so close you could sneeze on your neighbors food. I ordered the crab cocktail app, and it was shredded, kinda brown and was really fishy. Not something I could even pretend to like, so I sent it back. I noticed a neighboring table that also sent back a fish plate stating that it wasn't fresh. So don't go here and order seafood... The rest of the dinner was sub par, filet with a baked potato. The steak was ok. The potato was eh. They didn't even take the crab cocktail off the check, but my date was kind enough to pay for it anyway. Worst steakhouse ever for the prices. I'd rather go to Flemings since the prices are the same."}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated... Great food and service.    The ribs are amazing and the rib eye is great too... add a loaded potato you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Not anything to write home about. Pricey but what really stuck in my craw was $18 for a glass of wine and it was a very small pour.  I understand that in a nicer restaurant you're going to pay more for a glass of wine but way too small for the price.  The server had very little personality and could've gotten a much better tip if she had been a little bit friendly."}
{"text":"An awesome NYE dinner at DC Steakhouse.  Outstanding staff all around!  Jess was very pleasant and took care of any and all of our needs.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"They are overpriced, serve an average ribeye steak, and charged extra to replace a baked potato with steamed spinach.  The only reason I give DC Steak House 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the good service."}
{"text":"Awesome!  We had a small party even here on Sat. Night. one of our guests from Milwaukee had a great desire to go to this steak place.  Service  was great, and food even better.  I had the petite tenderloin and added a small lobster tail with it.  The loaded potato that came with the meal was the best comfort food along with the steak and tail.  Husband had the small prime rib serving that they have on special that Saturday night.  We were 8 adults and we all had fantastic food, can't say enough about this place.  It is in historic downtown Chandler on the square, kinda like New Orleans French quarter, very hopping that evening."}
{"text":"Prime rib is outrageous, ordered rare, very little fat, melt in your mourn goodness!!! Yeah!!"}
{"text":"Nice steak. Seasoning was OK. Cooked medium, was good. Baked potato. Added bacon and sour cream. A few mushrooms (would like to have had more come with the steak for that price). Salad with house dressing was 4 stars.  Good atmosphere in downtown Chandler. Food, nothing really noteworthy. Will I go back, yes, probably. Will I look forward to going back, probably not."}
{"text":"Wow what a great ambiance and good this place has. The bread is wonderful, decent wine selection, steaks cooked to perfection, and deserts that are mouth watering. This meal was accompanied by a great waitress (Jessie). She was knowledgeable about the food, all the sides and dressing, and super friendly. I highly recommend this spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"That was our 1st visit to this restaurant. It was my bf's bday so we decided to try something new, this place looked very appealing from outside. We called in earlier and they suggested 7pm reservation. We arrived on time but then we got offered  bar top instead, we refused and kept waiting for our table. We finally got sat, it took 14 min till server got to our table (we actually finally waived at one). Hostess said it was new servers error and blamed everything on staff. We got our bottle of wine but water took another 20 min to arrive and we had repeatedly ask for it. We never got our bread for side salad. My filet mignon was overcooked, his ribeye undercooked. Not once our server asked if meals were ok, of course they forgot my sweet potato fries, they arrived to the table after I was done with my filet, server joked it was my desert. We never seen a manager at our table. You cant have these kinda of prices with applebees level of service!!!!"}
{"text":"I attended a work dinner for a party of 7 people.  The dinner was excellent! Everything was flavored very well.  The asparagus is the best I've had at any restaurant.  All entrees include a salad, so no additional cost! This was a plus.  The atmosphere was pretty loud for a Monday night.  May have been Monday night football and/or multiple large parties in the same vicinity.  Overall, I would go back again!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for out 18year anniversary. We usually go to The Keg. Any-who wasn't to impressed with it. We received our bread first looked like the French bread we get from Albertsons I was expecting more of an artisan type bread. We then received our salad it was welted and some parts were rotten the cucumbers were yellow and looked like they were frozen then thawed out. The croutons were the only good thing on the salad. Our entrees came I got a ribeye with a loaded baked potato. I was kinda torn away of the presentation of my plate. My poor ribeye was swimming in the oil. My husband got a filet with lobster tail. OMG... $70 for the 5oz and a tail. They need to put what the market price is. It's like a hidden fee crazy fee. I don't think we will ever return here. Other than that the staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for NYE with friends of ours and the Filet Mignon with their lobster was amazing! Steak was so tender and lobster was cooked perfect that it melts in your mouth. The calamari was so flavorful and not chewy at all, as would other places. Would definitely go back there again, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - dark wood and white linens.  Filet mgnonn was tender as any good steak house should be.  They do grill their steaks here, something I think is important to know as usually I like mine done seared then finished in an oven.  None the less it was good.  Took my pop here and he like himself a sauce such as a bearnaise, but they did not offer this.  Even a peppercorn sauce would have been nice - but like I mentioned before, they grill here and I find grillers like the taste of the meat and don't count on sauces.  Sorry pop, deal.  Entrees come with baked potatoes, fries or sweet potato fries.  Of course I had the baked which was perfect.  Mandy at the bar served us and she was fantastic - very knowledgeable, upbeat and accommodating.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place since it seems like it was a nice small local place. I had reservations based on the reviews here but we tried it.   The place looks nice when you come in but the paper doilies place-mats should have been out first clue. Our experience here was not good.   The bread is not fresh made but rather warmed only. I ordered the grilled chicken and my husband ordered a small fillet. We both changed our starches that came with the meal one from baked potato to mashed (boxed and lumpy too not made from scratch) and my husband to veggies. The menu doesn't say anything about up-charges for those items and neither did the waitress. So when we got the bill and we got an up charge from my baked potato for $3.00 to mashed I was amazed as well my hubby had the same up-charge for his veggies. We both also got a $2.50 up charge from changing our garden salad to a Cesar salad as well. The chicken was overcooked and the fillet was the smallest thing I had ever seen there is NO way it was the right weight.   I tend to think that if they could have found a way to up-charge for the ice in our glasses of water they would have. Skip this place until they figure out one how to make fresh bread, real mashed potatoes and weigh a steak properly. Oh and don't forget to ask if the ice is an extra charge too."}
{"text":"Great Service at the Bar as well as the Table.  The Walleye was simply the best!!!"}
{"text":"The eggplant appetizer is to die for, great drink and wine selection. Service is always five stars."}
{"text":"Cocktails were great, the salmon and the pork chops were cooked to perfection. The food was hot Off the grill. Our server Kevin provided an exemplary customer service experience. Overall, it was a beautiful experience"}
{"text":"Excellent steak and Lobster, Fair pricing, excellent service. Staff handled the busy time with ease (Sunday 5pm). We did a Groupon (80 for 40) and it was totally worth it! We will be back. You can reserve seating by a window or outside as well. Love the atmosphere and decor. Manager was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Way too spendy for such ordinary food. I got the cajun rockfish for $24 and it was decidedly boring, not nearly enough seasoning. The Tiramisu martini was delicious but the salads were not. They use lots of iceberg lettuce! The ambiance is nice but the lighting is so dim you can barely see your food and the restaurant is very loud. Be prepared to say \"what?\" to those sitting across from you, and my hearing is perfect. Overall, nice place but I would never return at the prices they're charging for such pedestrian food."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 9:30 on a Thrs. Orelia (aka \"O\") was our server . My wife and i have conflicting work schedules, it was nice to see a nice place open that late.Very happy with the service ,food and prices. Not sure what people are complaining about . For $23 I got a salad, AWESOME bread, and a 14 oz ribeye.( ohh and great service). My wife had the Salmon, it was cooked perfectly. The wedge salad is Huge and covered with tasty bacon. Reasonably  priced beer and wine. (PBR$3-Kiltlifter-$5)Only thing I would say that was not perfect, I ordered my steak med. rare and it was closer to rare but had great flavor. I will prob try the fillet WHEN we go back."}
{"text":"Foxy Ladies of Robson Ranch we need to dine here!  Fabulous atmosphere, great service and delicious menu with lots of choices.  Shopping is convenient as well!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was the best steak I have ever had! Beautiful clean restaurant, great atmosphere, linen tablecloths & napkins, friendly service, delicious fresh bread, wonderful salad, perfectly cooked filet with great flavor, no fat, & serious tenderness, &  tasty sweet potato fries! This place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be returning! Our server Daniel was wonderful as was the entire dining experience!!"}
{"text":"this place is very nice and for the people who slammed this place need to get help or open their own steak house I been there a lot and got great service every time and the food was great I have been at the higher end steak houses for the price not bad."}
{"text":"The hotel recommended this steakhouse to us and we can see why. What's not to like about Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds and Calamari for starters. How about a Ribeye and a lobster tail cooked to perfection over a open fire served with a wonderful Caesar salad and thinly fried sweet potato fries. The food is excellent here and the service is very good. It's nice and cozy inside with a very casual vibe. The drinks are very good so that's makes your dinner taste even better. Didn't think we would have room for dessert but once we saw the Cheesecake we changed our minds. What a great ending to our meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's upscale and not a franchise.  The steaks are great and service is good.  It's nice to have this establishment in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"I cannot believe people say the steak at Outback is better! If you appreciate the QUALITY of meat at a mice steakhouse, ignore those opinions. Last couple of times I went to OB, ordered the filet, told my husband I just don't want to bother anymore, as the meat is very blah, not worth it. Thus VERY happy to have found DC in the last year! If you are a sucker for seasoning salt flavor, you might not appreciate DC. If you can feel and taste the quality of a high-end cut of meat, you might be pleasantly surprised by the price point here. Steaks are 1/3 to even 1/2 what the big guys charge (depending on which high-end chain you compare price to).  We have been to DC 4 times now, great quality meat (filet, NY, Porterhouse) NOT camouflaged in \"seasoning\" to hide mediocre quality like Outback. Good glasses of wine, sides are typical steakhouse good, but about 1/2 what the big dog chain steak houses charge. Bread is fresh & warm. Atmosphere is nice, warm, dark-ish but not cave-like. Classy but not fussy. Great wall mural, nice use of historic space. Happy to support a local biz when we want a steak night for less than $100. I jump on the coupon every time it gets released, as we are happy with full-price here. Discounted?! AWESOME.  Basically, when we want the steakhouse experience (rather than grilling it ourselves) with a good quality cut of meat, we head to DC. Great balance of quality & price."}
{"text":"Hello to all my fellow foodies!  So we've all seen the food shows like Dives and drive ins?... Not sure of its name since I stopped watching after going to the recommended places....and finding out that that host guy definitely was not eating the same food  us average Joes were..   So....  I tried watching CHECK PLEASE... Thinking 3 impartial every day people were reviewing it... Hmmmmm.     Perfect example .... DC STEAKHOUSE!  Everything on tv looked so yummy and everyone enjoyed everything.. They must have know they were coming and made sure everything tasted good because what those 4 people on that show experienced was NOT what we experienced!  We made a reservation for our Anniversary and since it was a very early reservation had the pick of tables...  The Hostess was super sweet and wished us a Happy Anniversary which was lovely of her. We had a nice table by the window... Perfect to watch the incoming storms and of course the passer Byers   Our server was very nice ( I chose not to mention names) and he was happy to answer our questions as this was our first time there.  On the plus side.... The meals come with an EXCELLENT salad... You must get the blue cheese dressing... Chunky and lots of flavor.....and a choice of a loaded baked potatoe (up fee) but if you like baked potatoes you must get it loaded... They bring you a dish with the sour cream, cheese, bacon, onion so you can create your own or sweet potatoe fries ( also good).  My husband ordered the sirloin steak med rare and I ordered the ribeye also med rare.  The food arrived and they had his steak on my plate and reversed... Easy fix but... Come on... Such a basic mistake in the kitchen?  My husband tasted his steak and stopped to add salt and pepper!!!! He found his steak a little chewy...   So I cut a few pieces from the edge and sampled a bite of mine.. No way!!! A steakhouse does not know how to season a steak? Completely bland...   Now, I realize one never wants to over season a good piece of beef.. One should only season to enhance its natural favors.  I explained to our server and he graciously took it back and I instead ordered the same steak as my husband... Requesting a little more seasoning.. Not wanting to take a chance on another cut  A woman came out of the kitchen (manager??, never identified herself) holding the plate that was returned trying to explain the chef only seasons the middle and not the edges and did I want to try a piece from the middle?   SERIOUSLY??? REALLY?  That plate has been sitting in the kitchen for 5 minutes with who knows who looking and or touching it.  I suggested she take a bite of the steak and tell me what she thought... She didn't... But expected me to?   I declined.  By the time I got the second steak I had filled up on the sweet potatoe fries... so when the steak came I took a bite just to see if it was seasoned... And it was... Not much but not tasteless.    My cut was far tougher than my husbands also  I wonder if this is a new chef or a new beef supplier?  A couple cons... Other than the obvious tasteless beef... Although must give credit where credit is due.... Steak was cooked perfectly.  I would have liked to see the server come to the table a couple more times to check on refreshments or just to say Hi... Just checking :)  The bread is as  boring as the steak... A soft tasteless French bread.  Now to the pros...   The dinner salad was seriously good!!! ( well.. The dressing made it what it was)  And you must try some Tiramisu... Really creamy and flavorful  And of course the lovely hostess who was very friendly and funny and again was thoughtful to acknowledge our special occasion at their restaurant!   I questioned getting an Italian desert  in a steakhouse but as it turns out the they do a better Italian desert than they do steak!  If I would have read the YELP reviews prior I would have seen other people experiencing the same tasteless meat... I trusted CHECK PLEASE!    Next time I ignore the people being paid to eat and review their food and go straight to my fellow Yelpers.  That was the highlights of our Anniversary dinner at DCSTEAKHOUSE.  We each brought home our deserts and I brought home my steak  I think this place lures the locals who want to dine in the neighborhood...   It is in a nice location perfect for an after dinner stroll  That's it folks... Try it if you want... Just don't expect what you saw on TV   Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"When your server lies to you about the food and what is offered and management does NOTHING to resolve the situation it's time to move on.  Even after the server admits he \"misinformed\"  Management  has the attitude you need them more than they need you.  There are much better steak houses in the valley that truly want your business."}
{"text":"Great local steak house, the best filet minion in town! The fried eggplant appetizer never disappoints and has become a favorite of ours. The service is always great whether sitting on the restaurant side or the bar side. The bartenders are always consistently good and mixing drinks and are helpful at recommending some of your new favorites. Try the Mediterranean Mule, it's a fun take on the Moscow Mule. The prices are a little high, but there is usually a good Groupon, but regardless they are worth it. Great place for date night or out with family."}
{"text":"Okay didn't actually eat here but Jeff the manager and Jen at the door were absolutely incredible. Phenomenal customer service even though we weren't even staying to dine at the restaurant. Will definitely be going back there to dine in. Ambience was lovely, menu looked great..."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered at dc steak house had been very good.   The only reason that I dropped the rating from a 4 star to a 3 is because how the crab legs are served now.    They had something special before with serving the crab legs already cut in half which I don't think anyone in town does.    When my wife and I thought crab - we thought dc steak house.    Now they're crab is no better than casino arizona or pacific seafood buffet.  Management - feel free to set yourselves apart again and bring the split crab back."}
{"text":"I don't know if they were still working out the kinks when these review added that aren't positive but this place is GREAT all around.  Great food and great service what more could u ask for!"}
{"text":"I met up with an old high school friend on Tuesday, December 9th to catch up.  I live in the Arcadia area and really don't know Chandler at all.  We settled on the DC Steak House because it was easy for my friend to find.  I also found it easily and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  It was amazing!  I loved the vibe, the bar area and the camaraderie at the bar with the bartenders.  The owner came over and introduced himself and was very kind - I have to say he was interested and interesting...a great combo.  I had the grilled shrimp salad and my friend had the filet.  Both were PERFECT.  I had a Cosmo (it was fabulous and I'm kinda picky about my cocktails).  My friend loved his Moscow Mule.  I honestly cannot say enough about this place and I'm going back in spite of the drive from Arcadia...it was WELL worth it.  Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to DC Steak House. Both times I have been very happy. The 14  oz Rib Eye is flavorful and was cooked perfectly (medium rare) each time. The add-on lobster tail was worth every penny of the $14 extra dollars, buttery and delicious.. Personally, I won't bother with the DC style again - $11 for a couple of stalks of asparagus, two good-sized, tasty shrimp, and a drizzle of hollandaise sauce Is a bit too much in my opinion. Both times we went we had a reservation and were promptly seated. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Even though we had a Groupon (which we presented as soon as our server greeted us) service was still top-notch and we did not feel that we were treated differently because of the Groupon.  I would recommend DC Steak House for a special night out."}
{"text":"The place is a hidden gem in downtown Chandler. I have dined here several times. The service is excellent, as is the food. The filet mignon was done to perfection. Yes, it's expensive, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why mediocre food is so acceptable or has everyone just settled for low quality. 3 of us went in expecting at least a good steak sadly no one got one. I ordered mine cajun style, thinking I wanted a little more flavor and typically this is seasoned what I got was an oil dipped chard piece of meat. I only realized it was soaked in oil after I picked it up to look at the other side of the steak and it was still sitting in oil. I would have been happy if it was actually grease from the meat but this was cooking oil they used to create the burn or chard effect. So I got burnt grill oil not seasoning or a spice rub chard.   I had at least 4 mouthfuls of gristle I had to spit out.   As I looked around the restaurant I was wondering how can these people accept this quality of meat from a steak house? Maybe they have never had a good steak or eaten at a place that serves a better selection of meat and its prepared and cooked by chefs that know the best methods to get results.    I've actually had a better ribeye at fuddruckers!"}
{"text":"Little gem in downtown chandler.  This is the 2nd time we have been.  Great service in this little restaurant.  It can get a little loud inside but it was perfect this time.  Food was great especially bone in ribeye.   We will go back again soon and so should you."}
{"text":"The dining room was at capacity when we arrived.  Thankfully, I had the foresight to make reservations, as we were seated within 10 minutes of our target time.  The hostess was fantastic, wish I could say the same about our waiter, who was as elusive as the mythical nessie.  Granted, the place was packed, so I gotta cut him some slack, however, I really cant extend the same graces to his lack of personality and charm.  An onion ring appetizer kicked off the culinary cornucopia.  There were about 8 decent sized beer-battered rings, somewhat overcooked, served with a ranch dipping sauce.  We both ordered rib-eyes, one bone-in.  Each came with a house salad, and a choice of frys or baked potato.  We opted for the 'loaded' option, sacrificing a pair of Washington's in the process.  The house salad was a standard iceberg mix accompanied with a single slice of cuke, three black olives and a trio of commissary croutons.  It was standard fare.  Milady had to ask for bread.  It was ok, slightly warm, paired with cold butter.  We both got to try our hand at \"maim the french loaf\".  The water and arnold had a hint of chlorine, so either they don't filter their water/ice, or they're trying to battle green algae.  Now, all previous grievances can be overlooked, based on the performance from the star of the show.  The rib-eye was pretty good.  Not $38 good, but it was tasty.  Great char marks, and cooked to order.  It came with 3 delicious mushrooms.  I'd suggest popping the additional $3 to secure a side of them.  The baked potato was medium size, served in tin foil.  It wasn't piping hot, so it took a little longer to melt the butter.  The loaded option included crumbled bacon, sour cream, chives and shredded cheddar, well worth the up-charge.  For a high-end steak house, I wouldn't rate it in the same class as Fleming's, Morton's or Houston's, and for the price, your money would be better spent at those places.  Understand, I'm not trying to slam DC... it was good.  But for the money, if DC wants to compete with the big boys, they need to visit their competition and take some notes.  With that said, I'd rather not see any patronizing responses from the establishment's representatives thanking me for my comments and stating that they strive to create an environment and product pleasing to everyone.  Replied like that are worthless, and show the disregard the author has for the customer's constructive criticism."}
{"text":"Took my boys there last Friday for a steak dinner.  Fortunately we got there before the sun set as once it does the interior is pretty dark.  How dark?  Dark enough that when my steak came out I had to move the glass away from the candle so I could cut the fat off.  As it was I wound up eating most of the fat as it was indistinguishable from the rest of the steak.  Also had the seasoned sweet potato fries with it, not what I was expecting for a top-flight steakhouse experience.  For $35 I got a steak, fries and a salad to eat in the dark; not the value I would expect.  With 2 appetizers and one glass of wine, with tip the bill came to $165, and having to resort to the light of a cell phone to actually read the print.  Not only is it dark, it's loud.  Bottom line, it's probably the only decent steak you'll get in downtown Chandler.  Ruth's Chris it isn't, you're able to see the food there.  DC management - for Christ's sake, turn up the lights!"}
{"text":"Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.  This last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!  Bottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said \"the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out\". Cool. No problem, things happen.  Out comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.  Bill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak!   Told the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us \"I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly\". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.  Owner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening!   I just said \"look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it\". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.  They literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.  Tip for the owner: Look up \"cost of doing business\" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.  Will be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was."}
{"text":"We love it!  Service, atmosphere, people and the steaks!  Simply the best Filet in the East Valley.    Yes I have eaten at all the higher end steak houses, Ruth's Chris, etc...   But those were $20 per plate more and no better .  We will likely be regulars here along with our friends for a very long time. Great job Guys!!"}
{"text":"We went hoping for a nice meal.  My wife had the walleye which she loved.   I had a filet and lobster.  I ordered it medium-rare; it was raw, not even rare.  I risked spit, etc and sent it back.   The rest of my food was cold before it came back.  An apology from the waiter but nothing else.  Never going back and do not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I dodged this place a few times due to the lack of reviews and low stars...but i somehow ended up here one night and left with a very happy and full tummy. The atmosphere here is very nice and i guess can be considered on the romantic side. From the get go I loved my server, he was attentive and was funny as well which is a plus in my book!  They have steaks, salads, seafood etc. We had some breaded eggplant to start and it was very good. You also get bread and oil/vinegar to start with as well. Now the entrees... the lover had the special fish that night and i had the king crab. THE CRAB!! came with the top of the shell all sliced off for you so no cracking, messiness!! i absolutely loved this concept. I was still able to be lady like and eat it with my fork. this is my new go to spot when I'm in the mood for crab. actually get to enjoy it instead of it feeling like a job by getting the dang meat out. also they keep the butter warm over a candle( it's the simple things in life that make me a happy girl).  I'm not a steak girl so I can't say the steak here is good but I will vouch and say that every plate that passed us looked amazing!"}
{"text":"We came for my birthday dinner. The Ribeye was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were creamy and full of flavor. Service was good. The only thing I would change is the iceberg lettuce salad. Romaine would have been preferred. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars, I would.   So, it all started with a steak...well, not really.  We never got it.  We had ordered a steak...THE most expensive one, I think-$44 porterhouse.  We were going to share it...aware and accepting of the ten dollar share fee.  Great! Now we get our own salad and...potato.  I'm allergic to potatoes...can I sub it out?  Absolutely!!! For an extra X amount of dollars...because I have to order an a la carte side...wtf?  Due to foods allergies, Can a girl catch a break.  NO? Great...we'll leave your mostly empty restaurant where we were about to drop close to $100...no prob.   The manager kept saying sorry and throwing her boss under the bus...lame.  Do you want his email... *#%ch...I want a steak!   Needless to say, I won't return...should have gone to Fleming's or The Keg or Ruth's Chris or Donovan'...I'll stop now."}
{"text":"Stopped in after looking on Yelp for someplace to eat. This is a very nice restaurant in a busy restaurant row in old downtown Chandler. People were friendly and the steaks were excellent. The side dishes, especially the asparagus, was out of season and very woody. Service was good but not five star, one server working several tables alone. Five star requires water runners and other assistants. Anyway, we will definitely go back. Budget $40 a person for steak or seafood without any appetizer or dessert. Other choices can be had for a little less. It would be easy to spend $55-$60 if you add courses or wine."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here! The service was very good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines. Their onion rings were delicious. And they cooked my steak very well.  I like the atmosphere of this restaurant it is sort of dark and relaxing there. I would definitely go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went here for a work group dinner.  Service was great, and food was even better.  I had the 5 oz filet mignon and the baby back ribs combo.  Both were awesome."}
{"text":"First time at DC and was very disappointed. We were there at 4pm when they opened, second table to be seated. We waited 25 mins for our salad to be served, and the lettuce was brown. For just opening, lettuce should have been fresh. Then we waited another 30 mins for our entrees. Steak was decent, nothing to write home about. Potato was pretty blah. Definitely not worth the money. Then found out on our bill that choosing a cesar side salad instead of mixed greens is additional $4/salad. Ridiculous. Waiter should have told us that. Not the worst place I've ever eaten, but way too many other great steakhouses in phoenix metro area to ever have to go back to DC's."}
{"text":"I came here with a great group of friends for a Sunday Dinner / Birthday Dinner. When I see the name \"Steak House\", my mouth immediately salivates because I am thinking of steak houses like Mastros City Hall, Flemings, etc.  Unfortunately, this steak house is not even up to par. The food was very meh...nothing to get excited about. The service...horrible. It took over one hour just for us to get the food. We kept looking around the restaurant which was not even busy on a late Sunday afternoon for our waiter and he was no where to be found.  All in all, don't waste your time here. The steak at Outback is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Prior to my first time at DC steak, I was eager for my dining experience, until my mother and I were disrespectfully treated by one of he hostesses (whom we found out is also the owner). We had made a reservation for dinner and regardless of our reservation, we were sat at a table right in front of the door and in the middle of all incoming and outgoing traffic in the restaurant. When we asked the hostess/owner if we could be moved to a more relaxing and comfortable table for our dining experience, since we saw other tables available, she quickly responded in a belittling tone, \"this is a table in the dining area.\" Since we both have ample experience with our families being in the restaurant business for years, we were appalled by her quick and rude response. It honestly had us considering leaving the restaurant and never planning on returning. The only reason we would return to this restaurant would be if we were served by our lovely waitress, Kris. She was incredibly accommodating and showed signs of concern regarding our dining experience. She checked in with us regularly and was delightful to be around during our meal. The meal we had was also delicious, but the first impression we received from the hostess/owner, almost led us to walking out instantly."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here for our 3 year anniversary!!   We ordered the top sirloin steak and the New York strip steak. Both were really good! They made my medium steak just perfect!! For sides we both got fries and we also got salads as well. I was bummed that they didn't have rice. Because I love rice with my steak. I ordered two martinis. Can't remember the first one and it's not on their website. My cosmo was good though.   I think everything was great except it was a bit dark so it was hard for me to see my menu. We went on a Wednesday, and there was a really big group there when we got there so it was extremely loud. I couldn't hear anything my fiancé was saying to me. Lol. Other then that, everything was great."}
{"text":"While visiting the area, my friend and I decided to check out this restaurant for a late 8pm dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. They were slow getting us drinks. The place seemed average for a Saturday night for foot traffic. I was really surprised not to see oysters on their menu for a starter as they had shrimp and calamari. As the night went on, it surely got quieter. I thought it was interesting that they had no music. I had ordered their filet mignon, with baked potato and it came with an iceberg house salad and my friend ordered their pork ribs with chicken also included the same house salad.  Our salad took forever. Luckily they brought out French bread. The iceberg salad wasn't anything special. I honestly don't remember when I had an iceberg house salad last. Shortly after our salads, our dinners arrived, yeah! My filet was awesome, cooked perfect medium rare and potato was great. My friend's dinner was okay, her chicken was dry and tasteless but the ribs she said were great.  After we ate, normally they offer a dessert menu, none was given.  Idk, maybe the waiter thought we were full from dinners. Perhaps the waiter was new and or the kitchen was slow, idk.  It was unfortunate as I would have loved to have something sweet and just maybe an espresso after dinner.   I did like the décor, with the long curtains, classy.  The owner walked around throughout the evening that's always a nice gesture. This was my first steak house that didn't offer oysters and dessert. I did mention to the owner as I was headed to the exit door about the oysters. $23 for a filet is pretty cheap that's unheard of in Cali., it would have been $50, seriousally.  I'll be back in town, I may eat here again. I hope next time though, they turn some music on, offer oysters and some dessert."}
{"text":"First time at DC Steak House and most likely my last.  Had the strip steak and it was OK, no complaints.  No matter how good the food could of been, the terrible service by \"Danny\" ruined it all.  Believe we were there for almost 45 minutes before we even ordered dinner.  Thought maybe he was fired a couple of times since we didn't see him for so long.  It was a Sunday and not busy so could only imagine how bad things are on a Friday or Saturday.  A friend of mine that works in the industry called and spoke with a manager and guess he really didn't much care.  So, glad business is good that you do not have to care!  There was a group of 7 of us and this place will probably not see any of us any time soon.  Keep up the awful service and not caring and I'm more than happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon whose expiration was nearing so we made reservations for a Wednesday evening at 7PM. A little over half of the tables were full, a little more than I would expect for a more expensive dinner (for downtown Chandler) in the middle of the work week.  The restaurant is dimly lit but still warm and welcoming, and is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. I liked the candles on each table, the wall murals and the Sinatra era music playing the entire time we were there. The bar made me want a martini but I settled for a nice glass of Rioja.  Our server was on point and did not try to rush us at all. At her suggestion, we tried the calamari, which looked like pretty standard calamari when it came out but had a really great flavor - the seasoning was perfect and my husband swore he could tell it was fresh and not the frozen stuff. It came with a side of marinara, but it would have been perfect if it had more of a cream sauce that calamari is sometimes served with (or just something better than a very plain marinara).  Our included dinner salads were really satisfying and fresh (nothing like the \"bagged salad\" comments from other reviewers). The spicy cherry pepper in my salad packed a big punch (while my husband's had zero punch), which entertained my husband for a bit while I downed all the water at the table and ate all the remaining bread to diffuse the heat.   The bread served with the meal was just okay - seemed like store bought french bread.  I had the 8oz filet and my husband had the bone in ribeye, both with the loaded potato upgrade ($2). Both steaks were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was simple and really brought out the flavors of the steaks. I would say that their pricing is right on point with the quality of meat they are serving (my filet was worth every penny of that $33). The loaded potatoes come out as baked potatoes with a side of toppings that you mix in yourself. At first this disappointed me, but then I realized it was nice to be in control of my own potato, I made it just how I wanted it.  Every staff member we came in contact with was very cheerful and accommodating.   Between the staff, the steaks, and the ambiance, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people looking for a nice evening out in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited here with friends to celebrate an anniversary dinner and chose this restaurant because of the reviews.  We had previously visited for drinks and appetizers the week before and had a good experience.  The service the second time around was extremely slow, service took about 3 hours from the drink order to dessert (on a Wednesday night)...The filet mignon was excellent, one of the best I've tasted, rivals or better than Flemings, Mortons or any of the other high end steakhouses, but I was extremely disappointed in the rib-eye...very thin, tough, fatty, not at all what one would expect if they were paying $33 for the steak. Side dishes were ok,...wine list not impressive..not sure if I would go back again.."}
{"text":"Favorite steak. Great prices. Love the staff. We went there 4 years ago by mistake and go almost every week now."}
{"text":"That's a funny coincidence that another reviewer said they would probably go to Outback instead of DC Steakhouse for the value. When I was eating here last night I thought the same exact thing. Wouldn't come back here without a Groupon. If you're going to pay that much, you might as well go to Capital Grille or Fleming's.  Came here because of a Groupon. Got the calamari appetizer. It was decent, but I've had better. Shared the 20 oz porterhouse with baked potato and steamed veggies. (fyi: they charge $4 for a split plate) We ordered the steak medium rare, but it came out closer to medium -- I think this was because the servers neglected to bring it to our table when it was ready; we saw it sitting under the warming lamps for quite a while. I would've sent it back, but the person I was eating with does not like to send food back and plus we were hungry. We both thought the steak was pretty salty too."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Phoenix.  Great staff!!! Awesome atmosphere.  Steak and lobster is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"awesome service, delicious food - seriously the juiciest ribeye steak ever!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this establishment's top notch customer service, outstanding food and drink selection.  Our daughter wanted a small wedding ceremony, but we thought it would be nice to have a higher end celebratory dinner.  We could not be happier. For instance, the wedding cake vendor missed the flower delivery at the restaurant (to add flowers to the wedding cake) so one of the awesome staff members, Victoria, went out of her way - and took the time - to elegantly decorate the wedding cake with the flowers herself; it looked absolutely beautiful!   I enthusiastically recommend DC's Steakhouse to everyone."}
{"text":"This is a great steak house for an affordable price. The steak was not 5 star quality but was a lot better then I anticipated based on other reviews. Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend's Groupon.  I read some of the reviews, and I was a little hesitant, but I thought I would give it a shot.  I saw one review about the crab, and it was an amazing dish.  My friend and I split the surf and turf, as I do not eat beef.  The crab shell came opened, which is a major plus because I usually make a mess opening up the shell.  The crab itself tasted delicious.  We sat near the hostess, and she even made a comment that the crab smelled so good that she had to go outside to avoid being hungry!  My friend enjoyed her steak and would give it a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Every time we are at downtown Chandler, my husband and I talk about this place.  \"We still haven't tried the new steakhouse\".  At first I saw all the negative reviews and didn't want to go anywhere near it.  Then, as their star average improved, I added it to my huge bookmark list.  We still didn't end up going there for a several months because I was waiting for a time when we were properly dressed.  It seemed like a classy kind of place.  I always peeked in there wistfully as we walked around the corner to Paletas Betty, eyeing the candlelit white linen tables, well dressed couples sipping martinis at the bar and catching a few notes of jazz music wafting out the front door as the pretty hostess in her little black dress opened it wide while greeting patrons.  Our actual experience there did not live up to these expectations.  When you look a little closer, you see there are paper placemats on top of those crisp white linens.  And the smooth jazz music gets overwhelmed when the restaurant is more than half full and is absorbed into the annoyingly loud din in the place.  And the bar?  No draft beer, the bottles they do have are $5 a piece (and they must store them warm b/c the hubby got one that was so skunky he could barely finish it) and the markup on the wine list (by the glass options) was high.  I paid $10 for a glass of something that would cost $16 a bottle retail.  I am giving them an extra star because my fillet was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  But this may be due to the fact that I always order my steak medium well.  From the other reviews, it looks like if I had wanted it rare I would have been out of luck.  The sweet potato fries that it came with, however, were bland and undercooked.  A huge disappointment since I really love sweet potato fries.  These tasted like they came frozen in a bag.  And the generic, supermarket brand bag, not even Alexia or the ones they have at Trader Joes.  Don't even get me started on the salad.  A sad little pile of extremely wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple of slices of cucumber and some croutons.  I know it is a steakhouse and so most people are just there for the meat, but seriously it was pathetic.  One of their specials that night was that you could add a small lobster tail to any steak for just $10.  I was super excited about this since I LOVE lobster.  It was served out of the shell, always a plus, and with both a lemon wedge as well as drawn butter.  Unfortunately, no amount of butter could drown out the overwhelmingly salty taste of the piece of rubber in the shape of a lobster tail that was on my plate.  I wanted to complain to my server but she was MIA for most of the meal.  By the time she reappeared we just wanted to get out of there.  I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"If I could go 4.5 I would!  A year and a half ago I gave this place 3 stars on bad service and fair food.  Thanks to groupon I made my way back to DC Steakhouse in Downtown Chandler last night and I am glad now to give them a great review.  First it was a Wednesday night and the entire place was packed!  A good nice vibe going on in there with a good mix of patrons.    My wife and I joined some old friends and another restaurateur in the valley and were seated promptly.  On to drinks.  I started out my night with a Gimlet (nice hot day and I had played golf) my wife a wine.  Both portions were very good, as were the drinks of our companions.  So a major plus there.  I really dislike paying premium dollars for a good vodka and getting what I would consider a small pour.  If you are going to charge the big bucks for drinks (there's weren't big but not cheap) then give a good pour, and they do.  As far as our server goes, he was top notch, on top of us and our needs but not in our face and really that is all you want with a server, so major points there.  Onto the food.  Since my wife and I are trying to loose a few pounds we each started with a salad (very large and fresh) and followed it up with splitting the 10 oz  NY Strip.  The meat was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.  It literally melted in your mouth as you were chewing it.  Our friends (including the other restaurant owner) had veal chops (2) and the fillet and both loved it.    So after a year and a half of staying away I am happy that the ownership at DC Steakhouse is doing well and have won me as a customer.  We will be back as this is the exact type of place that we Chandleridians (is that a word) need.  Good food, a bit upscale without being pretentious, and good service."}
{"text":"All I can say is this was one of the best steaks I have had in a long time.  Service was good as well.  The restaurant is not huge which is nice sometimes.  I read a few of the reviews and wasn't sure what to expect, but I came away wanting to go back!"}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5.  Like the location...old downtown Chandler.  For those of you who are from Chandler (old school) you can really appreciate how it's been redeveloped.  Food...not bad.  Service....not bad.  Value....meh.  It's not on our rotation, but we've eaten there 3 or 4 times.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! The owners and the staff are very nice and filing. Love eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a very long time now. The atmosphere is relaxing, romantic and well very decorated. Service was top notch and our waitress was very attentive. Their complimentary bread was freshly baked and I had 4 slices before my meal arrived. I ordered a 14 oz ribeye with a side of asparagus and it was absolutely delicious. It was juicy, tender and cooked medium rare exactly to my liking. To finish up with the wonderful meal, I managed to make room in my stomach for a homemade Tiramisu. It has just the right amount of sweet and it is a must order item.   The entire night was wonderful. I'll definitely come back here again for the Prime Rib that they serve on Saturday only (limited supply)."}
