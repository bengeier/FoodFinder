{"text":"Most of the staff were friendly, but one just plain ignored us. She kept giving prizes to another family ahead of us, but wouldn't even smile in our direction. The place is poorly laid out. We walked in past several arcade games, toward the food counter looking for where to pay in the dark this is challenging. Great concept, but it is overpriced for what you get.  The arcade games system is great with a swipe card that gets credited directly and tracks the tickets; however, $40 later and we still didn't have enough credits for anything worthwhile. Some random kid was complaining to me that she didn't have enough credits to play any games that were interesting. As a first time visitor, I would not recommend it to others. Would I go back? Since we didn't get anything with our tokens, we probably will but I would say walk to a dollar store in the dark and buy yourself some cheap crappy toys for $5 or $6. Probably equally as good family time."}
{"text":"Me and my family went there for an exciting indoor activity and we got what we expected. Its a glow in the dark monster themed mini golf. It sounds scary but trust me it's not as scary to give you nightmares. It's a fun place. Apart from mini golf they have arcade gaming and a nice cafe. I love visiting this place every now and then with my family."}
{"text":"I brought my Cub Scout group to Monster Mini golf for their year end wind up party. We had a blast. The manager was so helpful and even gave us a discount, being with Scouts. The kids loved the black light, the random dance-offs and the random challenges throughout our game. Stella's Kitchen could benefit from more snack and single serve items; our options that night were a bag of chips and either a can or bottle of pop. But that's not what we were there for; we had fun playing mini golf.   The arcade games there were a bit pricey, being 2 to 6 credits per game (and I believe one game was 12!) and because of this, a couple of the kids only got to play a few games before their credits were gone. But I liked that their credits were on a card that you swipe in the machine.   Overall a super fun place to bring the kids! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday with a large group and they accommodated us easily. The black light mini golf was fun, the only downside is how the course is set up, so you're always either waiting or trying to hurry on a Saturday night. The staff were great and did mini contests at some of the holes, there is a mini arcade with some smaller games as well to pass some time. All around it was a fun night and I would go back."}
{"text":"This place was  not fun at all. Poorly laid out course made with spare two by fours in a weird warehouse lit with black lights. Mini golf courses usually have a flow to them, or at least a couple holes where there are certain ways to make par. This course seems like it was put together the morning of. Pricing was ridiculous for what it was. Take your money and go to the mini golf course in panorama or just outside NE Calgary off highway one. I have no idea how this place has such a high rating."}
{"text":"This was absolutely awesome! The staff were so nice and my family and I are definitely coming back! The course was cool and I loved the lights. I would recommend this place to anyone anytime!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this place! Like, way more than I thought I'd be. The mini golf course is fun and interactive.They don't all feel super similar or anything. The decor is pretty cool. It might be a bit overwhelming for small children, as the music is pretty loud (as other reviewers mentioned) and it is quite dark, other than the glow-in-the-dark decor. I appreciate the fact that they have lockers available for a $1 deposit, which is refundable. It makes it a lot easier to put your stuff away rather than to have to worry about it when you are golfing. Generally, it is a pretty pricey spot; but if you get the groupon, then it is a great deal. Usually, they charge $13.50 per round, and on Groupon, you can get 4 rounds for $25.00. It's cheaper to buy that Groupon than it is to just regularly purchase 2 rounds! Also, once you finish your mini golfing, they handed a card to whoever lost the game to come back to practice. When we were golfing us, they greeted us  and asked us a superhero trivia question in exchange for a couple necklaces that could be redeemed for 25 tickets, which I thought was a pretty smart gesture. The arcade is nice, I like the card system. It is easier than Chuck-E-Cheese where you have to lug around lots of tickets and tokens. We had no issues with the card system, other than the fact that all the games require a minimum of 2 credits to play, and at the end I ended up with 1 credit which was kind of annoying because it was basically like wasting money. 1 credit = 25 cents, the games range from 2 to 8 credits, which I find pretty reasonable. They had a deal where if you bought $20.00 worth of credits you would get an extra $5.00 for free, which was what we did. Anyways, a good place overall. I am knocking off one star just because if you were to NOT have the Groupon, it'd get very pricey, especially for a family, and also because it is not clear where the entrance sign is. When we entered the door at the front of the building there was an exit sign and since we had never been there before we had no clue where to go or what to do."}
{"text":"This place is fun for the whole family!  The animatronic robots are placed throughout the 18 hole golf course and pop up when you are least expecting it. The course is challenging, but it has a lot of opportunities for hole-in-ones. There is great music playing and the staff do a wonderful job of dancing in character and keeping the spooky vibe alive. There are great arcade games and prizes. One of the mad scientists gave us some beads while we were golfing and we traded them in for cool prizes. I am almost 30 years old and I felt like a kid again. This place is a must-go!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a hot mess when it's busy. First, you line up to buy your rounds of golf. They give you a number and tell you to wait until your number is called and then go collect your clubs for your turn to golf. Fair enough. They estimated an hour wait so we decided to play some arcade games. We went to the token kiosk to buy a card and the machine craps out and tells us to see an attendant as the machine cannot dispense cards. We go to the counter to see an attendant and she kept asking us for a receipt. We didn't get one. She was actually quite rude with attitude as if it's our fault that the machine broke down. She said there was no other way to purchase tokens except to go stand in the main line again that we had already been in once. Fine. Off I go. 55 minutes later, I'm still no closer to the front of the line and our number for mini golf is up so I abandon the line up. I gather everyone in our group up ( there was 10 of us, so just imagine the lost revenue for allllll those game tokens that 7 kids could have burned through in 45 minutes!) Anyways, we went to pick up our clubs and were directed to ANOTHER FRIGGEN LINE UP!!!!!!! There, we spent another 40 minutes waiting to start our round of golf. The unfair part is that people who know how this place operates stands in that line up right after buying their admission, knowing that when their number is called, they are in the front of that line. It's a really poor set up. I believe that once your number is called to collect the clubs, you stay in that same sequence for the course entry. It really wouldn't be that hard to control.   Once we got in, the golf area was good. Nice art and music and kept the experience up beat. Kids had fun. Adults got bored half way through as there was no challenge there. Our experience was 'meh'.   MANAGEMENT- My advice to you would be to add more token machines and to have a cashier dedicated to token sales or at least share the cashier that is taking tickets for prizes. She was dead all day and could've helped us more than she did. You will make more money when tokens are more accessible to the consumer. You lost at least $100 from our group today. Just imagine all the other people who had the same experience we had. Winter is coming. More bored Calgarians will be flocking to your business for entertainment. It will be busy. Now is the time to prepare for it! Make it easier to take our money!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gonna start by being honest - I am not a fan of mini golf. I find it boring and takes too long and people get to serious and its just boring. Surprised I didn't feel this way after playing here.  Went with a groupon - great deal as its a little expensive. But also not sure how much mini golf costs anywhere else in Calgary so maybe I am wrong.  After getting the tools we needed, got briefed on etiquette before starting. LOVE that they have a 5 shot maximum for each hole and then your turn is over and you move on. Helped keep the game moving and from people building up behind one another. The decor is pretty awesome and the holes vary in difficulty. Found that because the game moved everyone was way less serious about it and it just became fun.   After 18 holes we were asked to declare who we though was the worst player - and that person got a coupon for a free game next time they came back. Awesome idea cause we would probably never come back but a free game will insight interest.  They also have a party room that you can rent out or you can book out the whole space. According to their website they also do weddings..."}
{"text":"Super fun place for date night or night out with friends. This glow and the dark mini golf is nicely decorated with amazing artwork with a sleeping ogre and haunted tree that moves and talks. A good deal if they have a Groupon online."}
{"text":"I took my super adult girlfriend here for mini golf as mini golf goes i did have a lot of fun. But I have a complaint, a super silly complaint, but I am still making it. I dont think the holes are lined up right!  Ok, so when you go to mini golf you should be able to look at most holes and say to yourself \"I hit that corner through the pipe and itll go into the hole. HOLE IN ONE IM THE BEST\" and then you miss cause putting is hard. but I didnt see that often. I felt more it was just i tiny golf course and you couldnt get a hole in one with out bending the space time continuum. Or maybe I am just real bad at putting, either is perfectly plausible."}
{"text":"Heads blown off in full view of 5 year olds!  I'll start with the good. Kind of a cool place. We were there for a birthday party, and the party room had mommies and bats and skeletons. And there's a whole bunch of cool video games and glow-in-the-dark minigolf.  Here's the problem... some of the video games (House of the Dead, AMC's The Walking Dead) are rated \"M\" (17yrs+). They're rated like this for \"intense violence\". But they're in full view of all the kids. Heads being blown off, knives stuck in the head and eyes.   I'm not a prude, but just like we restrict tobacco, alcohol and porn from kids, we restrict violence for the same reason. Their young impressionable minds aren't engineered to process this kind of stuff.   I mentioned something to the owner, he said \"he'd think about it\". He mentioned that these games are placed in such a fashion as to maximize revenue. I challenged him and said \"integrity and protecting kids should be placed above the almighty dollar\".  The solution is simple... put the (higher revenue) violent games in a section of their own, not visible to everyone. People can still play them. And maybe put a sign that says \"warning parents: mature content area\"... or something. It's not complicated.  I gave 2 stars not 1 only because the owner, Wasim (?) agreed to leave one of the games unplugged (which was right where all the birthday party kids were playing). I appreciated that - though it didn't come without some arm twisting.  My advice, call before you go and ask if they've addressed this at all. Otherwise, don't bring your kids under 10 there.  Just my two cents. ;-)  Ps - if they do make this change, my rating goes to four stars, not two!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here.  I was impressed even though it was ran by teenagers.  The mini golf itself is not that hard but it is fun.  I took my nephew here and he enjoyed himself.  There is an arcade that wasn't the worst I've seen.  To play games you load up a card for a certain amount and let the child in you go wild. I didn't eat here but I'm sure it's just hotdogs abd burgers.   If you want something else there is a coco Brookes in the same plaza.    At the end of our game I was asked who was the best player and of course it was my nephew so I was given free admission to practice my game.   It is a good way to get groups to come back!  Had a Monster time and will return."}
{"text":"Went here for my 22nd birthday last weekend; was wanting to do something different. Definitely best decision I've made. We all had a lot of fun; will definitely be back for more mini golf and arcade play"}
{"text":"This place is soooo much fun!!!! What a great design and idea. Love the arcade games the minigolf course is set up to be tons of fun. The staff are friendly and nice. Great idea for a date night or to just chill with friends"}
{"text":"Cool to play, too busy to play. Art is awesome on the walls, and the holes can be challenging. Waiting behind a family of 6 is tedious.   I'd like them to have more non-ticket games to play, or a small area to Kung-Fu fight a small child. Good spot, but too long of waits and not enough non-ticket games."}
{"text":"A new spot in Calgary to check out.  We have played glow in the dark mini putt before, and went to check out Monster shortly after it opened.    Obviously, it is intended more for kids, but there is nothing wrong with adults playing glow in the dark mini putt........right?  .....   Anyone?  ......    So for the kids and the young at heart, it is a good time!  They are very theme oriented with the Monster/Halloween theme.  Suitable music (great playlist actually), fun decor, and friendly staff often approaching us as we played with Monster themed trivia questions for prizes.    The mini putt course itself was fun, but compared to others we have done, it was lacking a bit.  It is wide open, just separated by ground level barriers.  Other places have more separated \"rooms\", but the result is the same.  I think that is my only real strike against it.  If it was much busier, I think it would have felt crowded and cramped because of how open it is.  The arcade section was fun as well.  Instead of fumbling around with tokens, you paid at the cashier for a swipe card, which kept track of the tokens spent, and the prize tickets won.    There was a kitchen there, we didn't get anything though.  Clean and well kept, friendly young staff.  A fun time out for all ages!"}
{"text":"This new activity centre recently opened up. The big attraction is the glow mini golf, but they also have an arcade area, and a kitchen with the basics. The arcade games issue tickets which can be redeemed for prizes at the counter.  Their space has two party rooms for birthday parties or corporate event. They don't have a liquor license so don't get too excited all you kids at heart.  The mini golf is fun. Its not overly challenging, but enough to keep a parent's interest through the hour ordeal. There's a few obstacles on the holes like a clock tower to get your ball through without hitting the pendulum, blasts of air pushing your ball away from the hole, and elevated holes.   The staff seem pretty engaged. They call you monsters and they are the mad scientists. There's a few staff wandering through the course asking trivia questions. If you answer the question correctly they give you a beaded necklace which you turn in at the end for 25 tickets to spend at the prize counter. They also have a DJ booth at the back of the course with staff making various announcements.  Overall it was a fun time."}
{"text":"Best mini golf I've been too. The ogre is pretty cool. Price is good when you have a one free coupon. Arcades are decent."}
