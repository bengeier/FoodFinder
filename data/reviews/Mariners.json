{"text":"Legendary hashbrowns... Good, but not legendary. World famous clam chowder... Very good. Loved how it was really thick and creamy, but world famous... Not sure about that...  I don't know... This place is nice, but with the limited menu for graduation and prom weekend, not sure if the 'best stuff' they put on their limited menu was that great. Don't get me wrong... food was good, but just not worth the price.  Service was fine, but nothing stands out about this place."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went for dinner during restaurant week. When we got in they were running 20 min late on seating their reservations, but that's forgivable because they were packed. Once we got to our table, it hadn't been set yet which lead to the hostess all but throwing plates at us.   Our server was nice enough but the service was nothing to write home about. The decor is rustic but very dated, the food ended up echoing the decor. Her shrimp cocktail was a mound of 3 shrimp... The cook on the steak was a good temp but inconsistent threw out. Our lobsters were poorly presented but were decent. But there were no sides on the dish what so ever, some meat and some lobster, that's it. Our deserts were okay, but didn't make up for a disappointing dinner out. Did I mention we didn't get our wine until we were half way threw our dinner?  We won't be headed back which is disappointing, we were looking forward to our dinner all week. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was really looking forward to patronizing Mariners for a special occasion, it was my boyfriends birthday. Since he is a chef and normally works on the weekends we rarely get to go out on a Friday night for Dinner, but when we do we have frequented quite a few of the restaurants in the Madison area. We have both been in the restaurant industry for many years so we do have have certain expectations, that should not be out of the norm for any patron. Mariners advertise themselves as a steakhouse, and such should be on the top of their game for great steaks. With all the competition in Madison for Restaurants, especially steaks i.e. Rare, Ottos, Tornado Room, Smokies, Toby's., etc, there shouldn't be any excuses for bad food or service if you want to stay in business.  Starting off I already was worried when on a Friday night at 730 there wasn't a lot of cars in the parking lot. It has been over 15 years since myself and my date had been to Mariners and were really excited for an awesome dining experience.  The following Is what we encountered:        -  The back room, where we were seated, very confined, especially if     your not seated by the Windows.        -  Dirty knife. No excuse for that. All silverware, after going through the dishwasher, should individually be wiped down with a towel and selzer water before being wrapped in napkins.        - Wine glass also was also not wiped down after dishwasher.        - After receiving our salads, that were nothing out of the ordinary, we noticed another table being offer fresh ground pepper by their server. Our server did not make that offer.        - I ordered the Admirals Tenderloin. I've had better steaks from Hyvee.         - Scallops very small, rubbery, overcooked. The Rosemary twig they skewered them in was overbearing in flavor.        - the crab meat that topped the steak was fishy smelling and tasted like out of a can. After one bite, I took it off.        - My boyfriend had the Chefs Tenderloin. Again nothing special. Cooked mediocre. The whiskey sauce accompanying it was not pleasing.         -  During our dining experience, we had the unpleasant ambience of listening to servers rattling silverware while wrapping it on the other side of the wall from us. Again. No excuse for that.  Overall, food quality and service very poor of an establishment that values themselves on 49 years in Service.    Our bill came out to $100. I have no problem with paying these prices when I'm given exceptional food and service. This wasn't the case.  After speaking with Jack, who I find out is one of the owners, and discussing our experience, he did extend a gift certificate for the full price of our dinner. I was grateful for that but it's unfortunate that we live on the west side and again my boyfriend works evenings. I would of rather just had an exceptional dining experience the first time. I will probably will be extending the gift certificate to my daughter and her husband, since they live in that area, and see what their experience is."}
{"text":"We went to Mariner's Inn for dinner on a Sunday.  The decor was old fashioned but mostly okay, except for the many bugs/mosquitos/ants on the window.  Fortunately they are on the outside of the glass, but owner could have done a better job with pest control just outside of the building. Service was below average.  Our waitress had an attitude.  Could it be that we didn't order an all-out banquet?  I don't know.  But we found it in bad forms that she brought us the check during our meal without us asking for it. Now onto the food.   Clam chowder was tasty, although a tad too salty if eaten alone.  The white and pumpernickel rolls were great.   I don't like it that they offer margarine along with butter, but no big deal.  We had fried shrimp and fried fish.  Both were very good.   However, the sides were pathetic.  The green bean was way overcooked and the vibrant green color had been lost.  The fries were just okay,not impressive. Overall, this is an overpriced place with okay food and below average service.  I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"We ate here 7/19 for the restaurant week menu. My NY steak was perfectly cooked. My wife had Admiral's salmon--only available on special occasions. She loved it. Good service and a great water view completed our time here."}
{"text":"So caveat first is that we went on New Year's Eve so expected it to be busy.  But also still expected good service, great food, and a nice evening. They had a special menu which was OK and the steak was to die for - which is the main reason to go there. But the service was sub-par to say the least. The tables were so jammed in and ours was on a corner so every wait staff that zoomed by bumped the table each time. That may sound petty but man was it irritating. One last gripe is that I wanted a glass of champagne (my hubby has beer no matter the occasion). They had a glass of bubbly on the menu -great. But the wait staff brought me a glass of white wine instead. By the time I flagged her down to ask for the bubbly and then by the time she brought it - IN A LITTLE CAN - our entrees were already here. the steak was awesome but that one redeeming thing did make up for a really mediocre NYE.  Staying home next year."}
{"text":"The fish fry on Friday is ok. Everything else is very over priced for what it is. I have been 3 times in the last couple of years but haven't been back after the last time because the service was bad. My wife and I felt like we were ignored. The waitress did not tell us about any specials which was annoying because after we had ordered we heard her explaining them to the next table and they sounded like something we would have considered. After finishing our meal we were not asked if we wanted desert or anything else she just put the check on the table and said  whenever your ready. As I said the fish fry is pretty decent and somewhat reasonably priced if you are going there any other night I can think of  much better places to spend $70+ dollars on a meal for 2."}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day brunch instead of Nautigal because we needed an early reservation.... We really love Nautigal and enjoy going for brunch any Sunday so we figured Mariners Inn would be just as great. First off, we checked in at the front desk and they ignored us and didn't seat us for 20 minutes (seating people who got there after us while ignoring us)... The seating area is super crowded and people were always in the way. The food.... Seriously nothing to write home about. Some of the same items we love at Nautigal were dry and nasty at Mariners Inn. We payed $28 a person for a limited variety of mediocre food... Not impressed!! The outside is cute though lol"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  There were a few recent reviews posted regarding restaurant week which had me concerned. Staff was attentive even with a a full house. Food came out quick and accurate. The mixed green salad was on the sweet side between the dried berries, candied nuts and maple balsamic; no complaints but definitely not the healthiest salad. I also tried my wife's clam chowder and regret not ordering which says a lot because I very much dislike clam chowder. This soup was creamy and had the perfect amount of clam flavor without being too pungent. The surf and turf came out hot, too hot to touch and the food stayed hot until finished due to it being served on a hot plate. I had the surf and turf and this entree surpassed plenty of similar courses I have had at other establishments, just not much finesse with the plating. Dessert was the cheesecake and the tart door county cherries made the dish. Washrooms were clean; furniture could use a refresh and the Christmas decor needs to go. Great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"This review is for restaurant week.    The service could use some improvement but we will give them the benefit of the doubt since they were extremely busy and the decor could use an update but overall we had a pleasant experience.  The clam chowder was to die for, my hubby said it was the best he had ever had.  The salad was really good, mixed greens, dried cranberries, spicy roasted pecans and a lite maple dressing.  The shrimp cocktail left something to be desired. It was three shrimp thrown on a plate with cocktail sauce that needed more horseradish.  All of our meals were really good and the steaks cooked to perfection.  It was kind of weird there was no potato served with the meal and nothing offered to add to it.  I heard the server at the table next to us offer it to his table ($1.50 for a baked potato, $3.99 for hash browns or asparagus). Maybe our server just for got since she was so busy.  To top it all of the desserts were amazing.  My hubby had the key lime pie (his favorite) the rest of us indulged in the decedent chocolate cake, Oh my goodness amazing!"}
{"text":"Ask for the lobster cream sauce. You will return just for it. The fried shrimp is crazy good, too."}
{"text":"OK is exactly how I would describe my experiences here. My recommendation would be to make a reservation and plan to arrive a little early and enjoy your first cocktail at the bar. We did this on our very first visit and had a wonderful experience. The bartender was super friendly with us and we chatted for the entire time we sat at the bar. We had dirty martinis and a shrimp cocktail (yum). During our time there, he poured us small samples of a few different drinks he had made for other diners and continued the friendly conversation. Once we were seated, we ordered our entrees and another drink. My husband and I both like our steaks medium rare and while mine was perfectly cooked, his was far too well done. He shared this with our server and she swept his plate away, no questions asked, and returned with a complimentary drink for him immediately. His second steak was better, but still not quite as rare as he would prefer. We were also treated to ice cream drinks and a free dessert to go as apologies for his poorly cooked first plate. Really great service and a fun date night!   On our most recent visit, we arrived without a reservation and were told there would be a wait. The bar wasn't full at all so I assumed they expected us to grab a seat and order a drink. Being that I'm pregnant, we had no intention of doing that on this visit and the owner saw us standing around. He immediately told to hostess to seat us to a table near a window overlooking the late. We were both pretty confused once we were seated, as the restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full. My husband is convinced they were just hoping to get us to order a cocktail at the bar, but who knows! On this visit we both opted for ragin' cajun seafood dishes, salmon for me and walleye for him. My salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. The shrimp that came served over top were fine, nothing to write home about, but the sauce.... oh my. If you like a bold, rich flavor, you will love this creamy, delicious sauce. My husband loved the sauce and shrimp as well, but his walleye had what he continued to describe as inedible skin that he could neither scrape off or eat properly. Later on he mentioned it seemed scaley... So I imagine there were scales on his fish! I wish he would have said something, as I'm sure they again would have taken steps to ensure he received a more acceptable meal. I think he wasn't sure if perhaps it was normal and just didn't agree with him?   Overall, this is a decent spot for a nice meal by the lake. It's much more quiet than Tornado, Wonderbar, etc, so you will be more likely to get in without a reservation. However, the food seems to be good/just okay. Don't be shy to share with the servers if something isn't to your liking!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Excellent stuffed mushrooms. Steaks were delicious.  Warm rolls were fabulous. Everything was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Mariners Inn to have dinner with four others on Jan 23 at 6 p.m. We were a few minutes early and had a drink at the bar. We were seated promptly at six. Our servers name was Jay. The server was kind, told us the features of the menu, and was prompt. We had surf n turf, tenderloin, hash browns, clam chowder, cheesecake lime pie. We started off with the most delicious rolls ever! Yum! Our dinners were absolutely perfect! We are going again..if you want a great place to eat this is it!"}
{"text":"We went to Mariners for restaurant week on a very cold Sunday night, the service was very good, a warm and cozy atmosphere. Had the surf and turf and a couple of New York strips with clam chowder. The food was good!"}
{"text":"As someone from New England, I assume that 'seafood' is from the sea not lakes, my bad. This is more of a steak place. Cozy atmosphere and very good service.  It's just hard to find real ocean fish in WI."}
{"text":"Decided to dine here for my Birthday. It was perfect weather so we decided to sit outside. Not the greatest views of the lake. It was fun to watch boats come in to the marina. We did get a chance to walk out on the docks to get a better view. On Sunday night's they have a steak and lobster special which is a pretty decent price, so that is what I decided to get. The lobster tail probably wasn't as big as they said it was supposed to be, but it was good. The steak was quite large and it was cooked perfectly how I asked. It was a very pleasant experience. We learned that throughout the summer they will be doing lobster boils which I hope to get a chance to go to at some point."}
{"text":"The Madison restaurant scene has improved greatly since I was young and The Mariner's Inn was the talk of the town.  Sadly, the restaurant hasn't changed even a bit with the times.  The food would of been exceptional in 1985 but they need to evolve.  I still enjoy eating here when visiting home because we don't have supper clubs out east, but still, for the price, they need to up their game.  Love the old school interior though."}
{"text":"Since our family was visiting, we decided to all go to the Mariner's Inn for steak and seafood. It was dark when we visited, so we couldn't see the lake, but I can only imagine that the view is spectacular in the daytime.  There are multiple rooms, lots of wood, and I felt there was almost a supper-club vibe going on.  The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Unlimited white and pumpernickel rolls were included. Soups and salads were very good and I liked that the salads include blue-cheese crumbles and not just blue-cheese dressing. We did have some small mix-ups in the delivery of our orders, such as the rare steak being delivered to the medium-well eater and vice-versa, but we quickly got that sorted out. The quality, flavor, and textures of the steaks were all very good. The sides were all fine. They raved about the hash-browns which were good but nothing to write-home about. Desserts were good, but not amazing.  The meal and experience were nice. The prices seemed a bit high for what it was, but the atmosphere felt like you would go here for a special occasion. It really did remind me of going to a supper-club as a kid."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Martha was very nice, and gave us amazing service!! Will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"I Just Love this place on Lake Mendota and have been coming here for over 30 years, especially for Romantic Special Occasions with my Late Husband that introduced me to it. You can't go wrong with anything that you order here! I just love their hash browns too. This is a Big Favorite with all my friends & relatives too & the Owners are just Wonderful. Service is superb here. Perfect setting & did I mention that we rented a boat skip here for years?! Move noticed quite the crowd will even travel here via there boats during the sumner & they are very accommating with their boat slips for their customers.   I do miss Betty a lot & it's really special they have their Betty Lou Boats named after her. I haven't gone on these yet as we usually have our own boat but we see what they load up on these for the patrons & it looks scrumptious with always a long line up of people to get on these. What else can I say; as every experience here has been memorable! Just Love the place & will continue to go here for the rest of my life! Everyone should go out there & try it out. Scrumptious food & wonderful service, so you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This is where we go anytime we want a romantic dinner. Excellent food, atmosphere, and service. The staff remember us and we are always treated like honored guests, not just customers.   We visited Mariner's Inn for the first time over six years ago, and we have shared anniversaries, birthdays, and Valentine's Days here ever since. The few times we've strayed to other noted Madison restaurants (Tornado Room, Ocean Grill, Ovations), we've been sorely disappointed - we always get the best steak, seafood, and service at Mariner's.  The best item on the menu (and what we order 99% of the time) is the Cold Water Lobster Tail - either paired with steak or alone. Tender, flavorful, perfectly prepared and easy to remove from the shell. Steaks are likewise expertly cooked precisely to order, either plain or with a selection of toppings such as blue cheese or crab. Of the other entrees, of note are the scallops (gigantic) and the king crab legs (excellent when available).  As another reviewer noted, the clam chowder is quite good - a step up from most restaurants who offer it as a sort of default pre-entree flller. The side dishes in general are not only tasty but generously-sized.   The atmosphere is reminiscent of a retired sea captain's mansion. Lots of lovely dark polished wood, nautical designs and art, crackling fireplaces, and a spreading view of the lake just outside. The tables are big enough to avoid juggling plates, but small enough to be cozy and romantic. Tables are spaced well, so you don't feel like you're sitting in the lap of the party at the next table.  The staff at Mariner's is a mix of old hands/family and fresh faces. I admit we've found one or two of the young staff less professional, but everyone has to start somewhere and the management is always friendly and helpful even to the point of obsequiousness. I have never had a problem they couldn't resolve instantly.  As with any good restaurant, you get the service you deserve - we make reservations, dress up (better than \"Wisconsin Formal\"), behave with sophistication, and tip appropriately. If you plan to show up in a t-shirt, chattering on your cellphone, and expect the best seat in the house, try Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"The broiled haddock was very good, seafood stuffed mushrooms are outstanding, very good brandy old fashioned. It's obviously a popular Friday destination so make reservations or be content to mill around the bar for a bit. Nice atmosphere that can work as a casual or dressier night out, right on the water. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday brunch, so not necessarily best opportunity to get to know a restaurant but I can confirm I probably won't return. Someone's heavy hand with the liquor (sherry perhaps?)  in the bisque absolutely ruined the dish & the meal to be honest. Lots of food on the buffet but most of it mediocre or just plain awful. No standouts. Whoever configured the omelet station to have people lining up in front of the door entrance is clueless. The desserts felt like warehouse bought & cut up quantity over quality fare. I would have given only 2 stars but the service was very friendly- younger guys prob students- and polite."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to Mariners Inn for our 31st wedding anniversary. We had heard good things about it so we thought we would give it a try. The atmosphere was nice, but felt a bit \"old school\" supper club. The service was mediocre, our waitress was friendly but unattentive.  Steak and Seafood are the predominant menu selections.  As a vegetarian, I was happy to see at least one menu selection available. Local RP's Pasta in a Alfredo sauce with fresh vegetables... Sounds great... Was very disappointing.   Flavorless sauce with whole cherry tomatoes a few peppers and a diced stalk of asparagus.   Didn't really come together as a dish...   My wife had the petite tenderloin with scallops, crab and a bernise sauce served with asparagus spears.  She also had the augruatine potatoes.  She thought the tenderloin was delicious, as were the augruatine potatoes. The scallops were served skewered on a sprig of rosemary that gave the scallops an unpleasant after taste, and the crab meat, was OK, but almost nonexistent on the dish.   Our overall experience was like that of my dinner... Rather bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed!  Tonight was amazing. The food was excellent. Steaks cooked perfectly. Their menue has changed with the times with many healthy choices and lower prices. I love the warm, relaxing atmosphere. We were seated by the fireplace  it is my favorite place to go to celebrate special occasions. It gets five stars from me."}
{"text":"When you go to the Mariner's Inn you just have to know that it is in many ways the same restaurant that it was back in 1975 when I used to go there with my family on Thursday nights. Back then, you got your iceberg lettuce salad under bright-red \"French\" dressing or blue-cheese dressing, ate one of the best pan-fried steaks next to a baked potato, and had excellent pie for dessert.  The essentials have not changed, and neither has the decoration.  And there is a good reason they have not changed.  The food, while not fancy, is delicious. I have rated this three stars for the pricing (it is 5 to 7 dollars too high per entree) but the taste is quite fine."}
{"text":"Went there for restaurant week. Clam chowder and key lime pie were great. Lobster was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. Sirloin was well done despite ordering it medium-well. I am saying it was dry as a day old biscuit.   Glad we were there for a deal. I would have been livid if I'd paid full price for that meal. Now I can just say, I'll never go again. Our waitress was rushed despite the dining room being empty.   When we arrived at 7 we had to wait ten minutes for the hostess to arrive. We were not greeted when we entered nor when we left. Parking lot was icy and dangerous. Coat room was storage for wayward things and in shambles.   On the plus side the ambiance was nice and the location is beautiful.  On an extra picky note Lake Louie warped speed scotch ale was $5.25 a glass which is pretty steep for Madison standards. Compare this to the six pack price which even at gas stations is $9.99.   Not going back again."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night. It wasn't as busy as we expected but that was kind of nice. We had a wonderful table looking out at the water (it was dark, but still cool). Our waiter was knowledgeable and nice and the food was delicious! I do agree with other reviewers that the decor could be updated, but it was kind of a cool, old-school supper club vibe. It really felt warm and welcoming - I'd go back again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with my visit to Mariners Inn during Madison Restaurant Week! Some less-than-stellar reviews on Yelp made me walk into Mariners Inn with low expectations. And those expectations turned out to be wrong.  Pros: 1. Customer service A+: All of the staff people -- the host, the bartender and our server -- were all very cordial and accommodating.  2. Food was excellent: I had the strawberry salad, salmon florentine and chocolate mousse, and they were all prepared and seasoned wonderfully. The dill cream sauce with the salmon was probably the best dill cream sauce I've ever had. If I wasn't in public, I would have licked my plate to enjoy all the sauce. Can Mariners Inn just give me a glass full of the dill cream sauce with a straw?!  Cons:  1. The place could use a few touch-ups -- maybe some new light fixtures that don't look scratched, and maybe some new chairs. I don't mean a full-out renovation because the nautical theme is fun and unique. But some of the pieces inside the restaurant look old and worn.   I will indeed return."}
{"text":"I took my wife, daughter and son in law there for a celebration.  We wanted a place where we could have a drink and appi outside, then move indoors for a nice meal.  That all happened.  The tables outside were old and dirty so that kind of turned me off a bit.  But the host was so very gracious and the apps pretty good.  We had the seafood stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, both were very good.  Inside we had a nice view of the bay and the service was good.  I had the steak and seafood, which was excellent.  The asparagas was soggy.  My wife had the macadamia grouper.  Good but over breaded.  The prime rib was just ok.The key lime pie was bad.   All around the food was OK but over priced, when all things are considered.   The place  is outdated, and borderline dirty.  They are going for the long time family place look and I get that but they still need to freshen the place up. Our table was varnished in the 60's and hasn't been redone since.  I felt sticky so I pulled my fingernail across it thinking it  was food but it was the varnish and finish coming off.  It was OK, but for the price there are so many better places in Madison.  I doubt we would go back for dinner.  Maybe an appi on the deck on a nice day.    I would say they are trying to be a 4/5 star place based on the price, but fall short.  3 stars at best."}
{"text":"I kept my boat at the nearby marina, and would stop in from time to time.  They play good outdoor music in the summer. If this ever gets sold to a new owner, has the potential for greatness.  Right now, it's kinda old and tired feeling. So, you know, Hit the early bird special, feel young again."}
{"text":"We have not been to Mariners Inn for a very long time now. The reason is that on previous occasions we have had terrible food. I had recently talked to a friend who said it had greatly improved so we gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. The food and service was excellent. I had a great \"hand cut\" (what ever that means) New York strip that was tender and very flavorful. It came with mushrooms and a sauce on the side that were very good as well. The hash browns were back to the way they used to be before someone decided to load them up with onions which was the way they were on our previous visit here. Very good as well. There were four of us and there was no problems whatsoever. Excellent service and food. They seem to have someone in charge here that actually knows what they are doing for a change. It was a little pricey but worth it on this occasion. I hope they can keep this standard up consistently to lure some of the customers back, who like us had written them off the list. I do recommend  them after this visit."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch! Made reservations online for Mother's Day, which was super easy ..great seafood, service  and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We haven't lived in Madison very long so recommendations and reviews are helpful.  My wife enjoys a good filet.  When I asked my coworkers, I received a couple personal recommendations for the Mariner's Inn.  Plus the Yelp reviews had some positive comments.  So I made a reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday.  I even called the restaurant and made a personal reservation and told her that it was a birthday dinner.  The decor is pretty tired and the place is a bit crowded.  For good food, I can get by that.    I don't know if the wait staff was short on purpose or not, but it was 25 minutes before our order was taken and another 40 minutes to get our meals.  The filet was far less than average.  It had a vinegary undertaste to it.  The \"legendary\" hash browns had way too much onion in them.  The walleye was \"ok.\".  The highlight was the cheesecake with cherries.  It was an excellent cheesecake.  We had club sodas to drink.  The waitress never even offered refills.  And, the birthday?  Nothing.  Nada.  Nary a mention.  Will we return?  Nope.  For the price, there are far too many options than to take a second chance here."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, food was fantastic. I had the Tenderloin of Romance and it was incredible. However, the server got ruder and ruder as the night went on. He had a large table of 20, and two or three tables of 2 and he was getting overwhelmed. He had his fake customer service voice on, and looked at like like we were peasants when we put a coupon and a gift certificate in with the check. He told us we could only use one (although the gift certificate was already paid for?) and he was fairly rude to the table next to us as well when they messed up his order. The host, Jack?, was super friendly, and wine was fantastic and so was the food. I requested a table by the window and they accommodated us very nicely. The only downside was our waiter, early 20's, man bun, fake/bad attitude. I'd for sure go back though, food was incredible. Great value for all that you get. $30ish for my meal of salad, rolls, 6oz tenderloin generously topped with crab and scallops with bernaise. SO GOOD, sassy server- not so much."}
{"text":"I am not impressed at all. For food we ordered calamari as an appetizer (pretty good but it was a little fishy ), clam chowder (I thought it was good but my fianc√© would have preferred it a little creamier),  petite salmon and asparagus (the salmon was overcooked and the asparagus did not taste fresh), caijun walleye (good but would have preferred the sauce to be thicker ), walleye fishfry (very bland) and the caijun tenderloin (the best meal out of the 4)  for the price I definitely don't feel it was worth it. As far as service. .. they had a girl who has only been there 2 months taking care of almost all of the tables. She didn't come check on how our meal was until we were done eating. I also asked if they had bbq sauce so I could dip my fries but she forgot. Also, at one point we were without water for probably 10 minutes. Then when we wanted to go we had to wait a while to get our bill and at this point there was probably only 3 tables of people. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! We enjoyed a drink at the bar as we were early for our reservation on a busy Friday night. Our bartender was friendly and poured a good drink while we enjoyed the unique old nautical decor.  The owner showed us to our table. We started with the seafood stuffed mushrooms. They are delicious! I opted for the clam chowder and my husband enjoyed a beautiful salad. The clam chowder is rich and lovely - no \"fishy\" taste. I ordered the filet topped with b√©arnaise sauce and crab meat. It was very tender and prepared as ordered. I would order this every time! My husband ordered a trio of filet medallions with the b√©arnaise sauce, one with peppercorn sauce and one with a blue cheese sauce. He enjoyed all three! We each had a side of hash browns - the only underwhelming part of our meal. Our server did well - very friendly and refilled our drinks and water as needed. After we finished eating she brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert. We had been thinking of a grasshopper which I believe a patron at a nearby table was enjoying and we were eyeing it up! It was a generous size - perfect for two to share. We'll have to try one next time as we will most definitely be back! Great food - great service - nice atmosphere -- ignore any negative reviews. This place is top notch!"}
{"text":"We go to Mariners once a year because we always get a gift certificate for this establishment.  There are some very good aspects and some not so nice aspects to this restaurant.    MAKE A RESERVATION  They say you don't need a reservation, but if you don't want to be treated like you're second class you had better make a friggin' reservation.  We went there once without a reservation because the dummy on the phone told us we didn't need one.  So imagine our surprise when we showed up and the host looked utterly taken aback when we said we didn't have a reservation.  After fumbling through some papers on his little wooden podium, he advised us that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, (even though there were no other people waiting and we could see several empty tables) and in the mean time we could wonder around the restaurant and look at their decor.  What?!?!  It was like six different kinds of retarded.        The food itself was pretty good.  I had stuffed lobster tails, and my dining partner had steak.  But it was the clam chowder served before the main course that launched me into orbit.  Who would have thought here in the middle of the country, far away from the ocean, one could find the most excellent clam chowder ever to be made?!?!  It's true people.  The clam chowder is worth standing around for 45 minutes looking at retarded nautical decor.    They do have a bar, but who cares. They have a decent menu but who cares.  GET THE CLAM CHOWDER or all is lost."}
{"text":"In from out of town this weekend (from California and Pennsylvania) and was in search of a good Walleye for my mom - we were not disappointed. Beautiful sunset, wonderful service, and excellent food. I am positive the entire staff is wonderful but our waiter, Brian, was the BEST. Helpful, knew the menu inside out and backwards, personable, knowledgeable and proud of his home - the list goes on.   Ignore any negative reviews of this restaurant. We will be back. Thank you for a wonderful evening to the staff at Mariners Inn."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week 2015, thinking we'd have a good experience like we did during restaurant week 2014. However, the scallop and filet combo this year was AWFUL. The scallops were tiny and rubbery, and the meat was thin, chewy, and had terrible flavor. We couldn't even finish our meals. The service wasn't much better. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The food here is really hit or miss, but when you get a hit it's the most delicious thing ever. The best thing here? The clam chowder for sure. I've come here just for a bowl of it. The restaurant is ok. I don't really like sitting inside and the chairs outside are terribly uncomfortable. Aside from the chairs, sitting outside, listening to live performances (the ones I've heard were really good), and enjoying the scenery while it rained was quite a pleasant experience. I don't like the servers I have here. They usually don't seem to know what they're doing. I really prefer their menu during restaurant week. I'll try to stop by here next time I see them up for the event. Otherwise I'm going to stick with the occasional visit for the chowder."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this place in years but I will definitely be back again soon!  We had a fabulous dinner here on Saturday night.  The waitress was really helpful and provided wonderful guidance and the food was delicious.  Definitely order the hash brown potatoes. We had them well done/crispy and they were amazing. The prices are very reasonable.  For an extra $10 we had lobster tail as an add-on to our entrees."}
{"text":"This is one of those places straight out of the 70s, when people went out to eat for special occasions and expected to pay a lot.  I recommend the fried shrimp. Definitely the best I have had in recent memory.  Service was excellent.  Clam chowder is good, but they are not fooling anyone with the store-bought croutons."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night which was their first day of restaurant week. Our server was mediocre but another server stepped up to help out.  I had the strip steak which was tough and lacked flavor. Hubby had the Admiral Salmon (stuffed with crab) which was very good.  No sides or bread basket were included or even offered, but when we inquired they brought out a complimentary bread basket and we purchased a side of fresh green beans and a baked potato which were very good.  Key lime pie was good but chocolate mousse was lacking and tasted more like instant pudding. Might have given it three stars but for the very poor quality of my steak and value."}
{"text":"It is a longstanding tradition for my dad and I to have dinner here at his birthday time. He's a fan of the traditional supper club, and that is Mariner's in a nutshell. Heavy wood interior, lovely window views of a Lake Mendota inlet and docked boats. Lots of birds to watch through the windows. Service tends to be attentive, which is nice. Soda was from fountain and flat. Server was attentive with ice water and fresh lemon for drinking. They used to have mixed greens for their salads, but are back to iceberg lettuce, which was disappointing. Mine had quite a bit of the yellow lettuce heart. Great peppercorn dressing. The clam chowder is consistently delicious and among the best in Madison. A basket of rolls came with the salads, two white and one pumpernickel. Since there were three of us, that seems kind of an assumption. One seemed less fresh than the other two, but the fresh ones were nice.   We usually get the seafood stuffed mushroom appetizer, which was good, although the hollandaise type sauce seemed a little thick and more bland than I remember. Stuffing was good with obvious seafood chunks. We had the Tuesday shrimp special which was a lot of shrimp--four large cocktail shrimp, three fried shrimp and two stuffed shrimp. I always love their fried jumbo shrimp--a light batter with firm shrimp, but the cocktail ones were disappointing. Stuffed shrimp were oddly similar to the stuffed mushrooms. Good cocktail sauce. Their \"famous\" hashbrowns are okay--onion flavor was strong and they are quite oily. Other sides were mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, french fries, au gratin potatoes and vegetable of the day. One time I had a rice mix, and I wish they'd bring it back. I'm assured by my dad and sister that the steaks are delicious. I've only made it to dessert once. It remains my favorite place for shrimp, but be prepared for heavy food. There is a \"lighter fare\" menu with smaller portions, which is nice, because the full portions are truly too much food (although most people will probably manage)."}
{"text":"This was on our list of Madison establishments we needed to eat at. We started with mules in cheap copper glasses.  We did have the luck to sit outside which was very pleasant.  We had cheese curd appetizer which was marginal.  The presentation was nice. We both had steaks that were expensive and the cuts were off.  My New York strip looked like a ribeye but was tough like a round steak.   I will say the service was very good."}
{"text":"The Good: nice and attentive wait staff. The Bad: the steak.  Not seasoned at all.  Not cooked correctly and tough. The Ugly: it's worn.  Could use updated decor.  The chowder was just odd."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  It was a slow night, the bartender seated us, but did get us a window seat overlooking the lake.  The food was very hot - I had a special - a small sirloin cooked medium (and it was actually medium) with a small lobster tail.  The waitstaff was very nice and not overly attentive (which was nice since it was a business dinner).  The beer selection was a little weak, but otherwise no complaints!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"went here with another couple for restaurant week.  the place was fairly busy.  we waited for 45 mins and were seated.  we had a reservation, but that didn't seem to affect the folks seating tables.  we got to our table outside wand waited another half hour just to see our waitress.  we noticed everyone around us was complaining about the slow service.  we ordered drinks and about another half hour later we ordered our food.  my lobster was overcooked and stringy and my steak was mediocre at best.  all in all my visit to the mariner's inn was terrible."}
{"text":"I find myself making a reservation for four or more at least twice a year at Mariner's Inn.  The von Reutenbergs continue to set a very high standard in the realm of supper club dining, and are, arguably, the best establishment to patronize for dinner during Madison Magazine's Restaurant Week.    Their clam chowder is very good: creamy, seasoned and perfect for dipping their house rolls into!  The surf (petite lobster tail) and turf (7oz top sirloin, I think) have never disappointed us.  The steaks have always come prepared to the proper requested doneness.  They had a new entree this time, Filet of Romance (or something named similarly), that my wife and father-in-law had.  Basically a petite filet of tenderloin topped with a Rosemary skewer of broiled quarter-sized sea scallops and sauce b√©arnaise.  Though I'm not super crazy about tarragon, I thought that it was a well-composed dish, and the steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Desserts are classics at Mariner's: Betty Lou's cherry cheesecake, a decadent chocolate mouse, and key lime pie (because why not have something tropical to take your mind ever so briefly away from WI's winter?).  All were good!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the low reviews. Everything was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We were seated immediately with no reservations. The host seated us in a room where my small child was able to explore. The Clam Chowder was super tasty.The steak size portion is beyond decent.  The Macadamia Encrusted Grouper is PHENOMENAL. The mango salsa that goes with it is fantastic. The service was great too. Our waiter was well versed in local beers and helped us select a great one. The location is beautiful too. A must go to!"}
{"text":"Where to begin... I'll start my review with the context that it was \"Restaurant Week,\" arguably the best marketing effort for local restaurants to showcase themselves to new patrons with simple, house specialties and memorable service to elicit repeat business. (Mariner's Inn did not get the memo)  The bartender who took my order for a brandy old fashioned and gin martini did not know how much to charge me. He required assistance and returned with proper change. (Fine, no biggie)  Once seated our waiter, Jake (not from State Farm), walked past our table of 4 to serve others three times before acknowledging our presence and said he would bring water and come back for \"our entire order.\" (Not a great start, but whatever)  10 minutes later, Jake returned with a teetering tray of ice water and asked what we wanted to drink. Our two friends asked if there was a drink menu. Jake said \"yes, didn't the host give you one?\" He didn't. Jake huffed searching his pockets and didn't find one, and left again. (Mildly annoyed now)  Jake returns with a glistening brow and a large leather bound drink menu and promptly asks for our drink order again. Our friends ask if they could have a minute to first open the menu and see their options. Jake acquiesces and leaves once again. (I begin to question Jake's mental faculties)  Moments later Jake reappears and again asks if he can take \"our entire order.\" We provide \"our entire order\" including drinks and he whisks away. (Finally, it feels like we may be in the clear)  Our first course comes out in a curiously rapid pace. (Hmm but Yay, food)   Plates are cleared then 15 minutes go by... still no drinks, water glasses are near empty and runners bring out our entrees. Jake returns and asks if we need anything. I ask if it is possible to have our drinks. Jake says someone else was supposed to bring them so they must be sitting at the bar. (Was it the one arm man?)  Our entrees look fine but are unaccompanied by any sides, not even a pad of butter, sprig of parsley or even cold bread. (Hey Mariner's Inn, it would cost you about 15 cents to serve rice or fries)  Jake returns with two of the ordered drinks, enough time for us to understand that they weren't just sitting around and waiting 20 feet away, but rush ordered. Our other drink isn't brought out because \"it's being poured right now.\" (Oh Jake, make an effort to keep up with your narrative)  The freshly poured, missing drink came out and by now Jake is a little more moist in the face; he says \"thanks for being patient with me,\" and promises me more water. (Sure, sure)  Ten minutes pass and Jake brings out our desserts but can't recall who ordered which dish. Fortunately we are able to refresh his memory while we move our entrees out of his way. He then plops a pile of forks and spoons at the center of the table as if we were eating communal style at an hostel. He then clears our entree plates. Still no water. (I can't bring myself to make eye contact at this point)  Jake comes by one last time and I ask for my refill on water. He now remembers that one thing that had slipped his beautiful mind. He comes back in a few minutes with a pitcher but stops at the neighboring table to jaw jack as I sit parched and fed up. (I'm done)  The night ends with the four of us remarking how unremarkable Mariner's Inn is, however it is remarkable that they're still in business. (Isn't it ironic?)"}
{"text":"Ok, I think everyone as some sort of love for mariner's.. for me, it was the place for my first date with my husband! We went last night, and I was SOOO disappointed. I can't remember the last time I had such AWFUL service.... the waitress had an attitude... was slow and absent for MOST of our meal, where her coworkers must have seen this as they were tending to us. The food was as usual.. great... but this kind of service will def make me think twice about coming back for a $70 meal.- as well as my last trip here was similar. So sad because I always loved it here..."}
{"text":"Found this gem and highly recommend to all.  Atmosphere and setting the best, the staff top notch and omg the food!  Will definitely be back again.  Thanks to all for a great end to a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I brought some of my customers here for a group dinner of about 30+. Man they took care of us. We had a nice selection on the preset menu from steak to fish. I had the NY Strip and the fried shrimp. Man that was a good piece of meat cooked the right way. The meal came with salad, rolls, and the meal came with green beans, potato mash, and hashbrowns. All in all, great staff taking care of us and a great meal. Will recommend when in Madison."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Some restaurants establish themselves and then never try to maintain standards when they achieve a clientele.  Our party was seated over 30 minutes after our reservation time.  Bread served with our meal comes with a variety of bread types but they all tasted  the same.  I tasted the ceviche and the clam chowder, which were good,  but not memorable. Surf&turf, cheesecake with strawberries, all \"pretty good\" but the food and atmosphere are not on par with the prices."}
{"text":"Easter Buffet was heavenly. Everyone in our group loved it. The food was flavorful, tender, moist, and delicious! Great assortment of wonderful dishes.  We ate on a porch with a great view of the lake. Loved the character and atmosphere of the Mariner. Wow!  Everything was great, including our service."}
{"text":"Mariners Inn is a favorite! We went there recently for a birthday dinner, and had a lovely evening. The food is consistently fabulous. Whenever I know we are having dinner there, I look forward to it all day. So delicious! I always order the steak tenderloin, hash browns and salad with peppercorn dressing. Mmm...the steak was prepared perfectly...the hash browns are crispy good, and we always have a frozen grasshopper after dinner - big enough to share. The server was knowledgeable and attentive, taking care of every request. We like the friendly vibe there...yes, it has a bit of an \"old school supper club\" feel...but that's what makes it such a unique experience. We like the nautical decor, and enjoy seeing the waterfront views. It's clean, friendly, charming and delicious."}
{"text":"Lovely location, especially dining outside. However the service and food quality have gone to pot. Mediocre stuffed shrimp, steak, duck, key lime pie. Clam chowder and basa were very good. One dinner order was the wrong dish. An unfortunate decline for a Madison tradition."}
{"text":"Husband was going to take me to a pricy French restaurant for date night.  I didn't like the menu choices so I made a reservation at Mariner's Inn.  I've heard soooo many rave reviews, and how fabulous the seafood is. We were extremely  disappointed.  First, the decor is very dated and dirty.  The wait staff was pleasant. Appetizer was the stuffed seafood mushrooms and they were better then they looked.  However, my steak and lobster was way over priced, had no taste almost like it wasn't seasoned at all and the \"famous\" hash browns sat in a pool of grease.  We will not be back and unless they revamp the whole place, chef included I don't see how the will stay open."}
{"text":"As former residents of Madison, we used to dine at Mariners fairly regularly and enjoyed it very much.  On a recent trip back, we were looking forward to a nice lakeside dinner at Mariners.  We made reservations and, when my husband requested a window table, he was told to let the host know when we arrived.  We got there a little early, requested a window table from the host, and had a drink in the bar.  When they finally seated us, our table was way in the back--a window table with a view only of the folks eating on the patio.  Guess we should have asked for a \"water view,\" but we didn't realize this little back room even existed.    So, onto the dinner.  Our waiter was very good, with one exception, which I'll describe later.  We started with the stuffed mushrooms, which were delicious!  As it turned out, they and the wine were the highlight of the entire experience--things went downhill after that.  We each ordered the tenderloin from the lighter fare section, and we fully expected a smaller than usual cut of steak.  When they arrived, however, they were not what would normally be considered tenderloins--they were flat, very thin and VERY chewy slices of beef, and were more like below-average-quality round roast than tenderloin.    When the waiter returned to ask about our meals, we replied that they were not very good.  Neither of us had eaten very much, and he asked if we wanted to take the rest home. We said 'no,' and repeated that they were not good.  He apologized and then said something like, \"well, if you want me to go and get the manager over here, you can TRY and get a refund.\"  We simply paid the bill and left.  We have only complained about a meal one other time, a few years ago in a different restaurant, and the waiter immediately removed the item from our bill.  All in all, it was a disappointing experience, especially since we had really looked forward to it."}
