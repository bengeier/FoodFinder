{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside but it was super nice and spacious inside. Everything is redone, bathrooms are very clean and nice. They have a patio area and a nice selection of beers served in frosted glasses. They also have a stage and have a DJ on the weekends. Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"The entire bar has been redone! May not look like much from the outside, but has a patio that is fenced in and you can bring your drinks to. Also has tons of tvs inside with to brand new pool tables. They just opened a kitchen about 4 months ago and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"The bar was totally remodeled under the previous owner and it is very nice.  Very spacious and nice patio. The contact info for the bar is incorrect. Couldn't call to see if they were still open late on Sunday. We ventured there and tried our luck. It was open. Very friendly crowd. The only negative was the barmaid was pretty tipsy and kept going outside for cigarette breaks while I waited to get serve. Unfortunately this is becoming a all to common theme in many bars not just this one. I understand I came around midnight on Sunday and might not have seen typical service. Hopefully it was just a fluke. Besides that, everything else was fine."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS. I went there on a whim as I was out with a few friends while I was home from my business trips. They moved locations and I must say that I do like this spot better. It is all updated. They have pool tables, dart boards, golf aracde game. Which is awesome by the way. I do have to say this is not a typical club hang out, it's a relaxing atmosphere that you can enjoy. The bartender is great, very friendly and knows drinks like the back of her hand. For a dive spot they have a great selection of regular drinks as well as some of the newer drinks that are out on the beer market. We stayed for awhile and everyone there was friendly and nobody had a problem with newbies.Coming into the bar like some corner bars do. I do ha e to say that tbis is proba ly one of my new favorite local spots now. Go check it out."}
