{"text":"I just ordered a #13 crepes ( $9.50 ) with Nutella  spread filling with strawberries and banana that comes with a ice cream of your choice, it was amazing! This place is so cute and tidy, staffs are nice. In my opinion, I've tried better and bigger portion of crepes at a different places with the same price so I recommend the waffle over the crepes."}
{"text":"I go here when I hunger for waffles+ice cream for dinner!  The owners are *so* welcoming and the ice cream is so good.  They make the waffles fresh right on the spot and they bring it out to you.  Seriously awesome service and a great atmosphere.  Wonderful experience and wonderful food.  A must-see for the dessert enthusiast!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for dessert places to go up in the newmarket area and we found this place on the aroundme app. checked out the reviews, decided to check it out.  at first glance it looks like a small cozy cafeish place. we were greeted by a man who was so nice and welcoming. he has the best smile! we ordered the california sunset, which was two waffles and two ice cream scoops bordered by fresh sliced kiwis and strawberries. the waffles were fantastic, they were crispy on the outside and warm on the inside, and stayed crispy even with the melting ice cream. it was delicious! while we were eating he even came by and offered a free sliced banana.   so basically this place was so good i made a yelp just so i could 5-star it."}
{"text":"Bene Bene Waffle and Ice Cream is a wonderful and local dessert place to satisfy your sweet tooth! The man the owns the store is SO welcoming and does an amazing job. I have never had such amazing service. I will be coming back again and telling others to do the same!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite ice cream place in the area ! Having Bene Bene 's ice cream is a must after spending an evening on main street Newmarket.  I would reccomend it for post soccer or baseball game treats for the kids or a delicious dessert for the whole family. Definitely a great way to end a date as well!  The service is friendly and quick .  The shop is clean with a welcoming vibe.  And of course the Kawartha ice cream never fails to amaze!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little ice cream shop and Cafe on Main Street in Newmarket. They have a large variety of ice creams and teas/hot beverages.   You are able to sample some flavours of you are unsure which to go with. I got a scoop of wolf paws in a plain waffle cone (vanilla with brownie bits and chocolate) and it was refreshing and delicious! The cone was fresh and crunchy.   While chatting with friends in the shop, other customers ordered crepes and the entire cafe smelled amazing as they were being prepared fresh by the staff.   Overall - definitely recommending dropping by to satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Very nice and great customer service. Ordered waffle & icecream, crepe & icecream. Service was quick. A little pricey but delicious. Also appreciated how the staff brought us water with our food :)"}
{"text":"Demetres will offer more variety, symposium will offer a nicer sit down atmosphere,  Bene Bene will offer you the best crepe waffle and ice cream combo hands down.  Not only is it cheaper compared to other dessert places,  its location offers a rustic romantic throwback to when life was slower and more relaxing.  The crepe has a wonderful chewy consistency whereas most places I've has crepes tend to taste more dry or fall apart more easily.  Exclusively serving Kawartha ice cream means you're guaranteed a rich,  smooth taste no matter what flavor you choose.   Great place to take your date!"}
{"text":"Really terrific waffles! They definitely taste home-made (not a mix?). They serve Kawartha brand ice cream, and it tasted very fresh, no freezer burn.  Very nice, family-run business."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much when you walk in, but looks are definitely deceiving. I've only been to this place once but if I ever come back into town this is at the the top of my dessert stops. Completely blown away - order a fresh waffle with ice cream, let it melt a little bit, and add some fresh fruit and Nutella syrup. Such a simple idea, but it's such a perfect blend of hot and cold to top off a great meal from any restaurant on/near Main Street. Or just enjoy it on its own -- it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is an ice cream lover's heaven. The flavours are great and the staff is so friendly and nice. I love the area so after the dessert you can go for a nice walk and burn off some of those calories. Always a good idea!"}
{"text":"Went there after checking the reviews...and it definitely lives up to the hype.  Service - awesome Food - fresh, great presentation and very tasty - i highly recommend the California sun set . The actual serving is way bigger than what you see in the picture.  Price - very reasonable and worth every penny.   Went with my mother and my elder daughter - will be definitely visiting again soon, regularly !!"}
{"text":"Waffles with whipped cream, ice cream and fruit was AMAZING. Also had the green tea matcha latte which was great on a cold night. The Kawartha Lakes ice cream gave it that special touch."}
{"text":"I have to say that the service I had here was amazing. Now onto my waffle, the whipped cream was fresh and so was the fruit it took a few mins maybe 10 to make the waffle from scratch and it was so worth the wait. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I passed by Benebene after a walk at the Tom Taylor Trail. I ordered a Belgian waffle with fruits (strawberries and bananas) and nutella syrup for $5.29. You can also add ice cream, whipped cream, or other fruits as you wish. The waffle is freshly made within 5 minutes so the waffle is warm at your first bite. The cafe has an extensive variety of tea and it also makes specialty coffees.   The staffs who worked there were really friendly and welcoming. They even offered free wifi password. Even though the cafe is not big, it it a comfortable space where you can study or chill with you friends to chat."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with kawartha dairy ice in a waffle cone?! The service was great, the place was clean and inviting and the ice cream was excellent. I would certainly go back . The establishment is well located in the heart of main street Newmarket, we went mid day and it was quite easy to find street parking."}
