{"text":"After having a negative brunch experience (food took forever and was cold upon arrival), friends and i wanted to give Harvest Kitchen another shot with dinner. Tonight was again, underwhelming. The server started with listing the items no longer available to order (it was 7pm on a Saturday). Food arrived in reasonable time. There were multiple servers, but a lack of communication-not clear if the specials had been read to us, etc.   Our vegetarian ordered the kale salad, asking specifically for it vegetarian. It came with bacon. Two ladies ordered the mushroom pasta, which was fairly tasteless, under seasoned and needed more sauce. And I had the veggie burger which was mushy, and didn't hold it's shape in the bun.  The good news is the customer service was excellent, as we gave the server feedback about the pasta, and it was removed from the bill (as it should have been). Instead of wanting to try underwhelming desserts and grab more wine, we decided to close the tab and head out for other, better Harbor street options. I'm bummed to have had this experience twice, as i was hoping it was a fluke the first time. Two time is enough to say I won't be returning, which is too bad, because it's charming. Their food just is never as good as the price points and hype."}
{"text":"As a student, any meal above $10 is usually a treat. But on a rainy \"spring\" evening, the shepherds pie, the indulgent dessert and a glass of wine was really something special.   While the food was not particularly innovative as far as vegetarian/vegan food goes, it was solidly delicious and comforting.   They had a good balance of both vegetarian and meat options. I ordered the mussels to share, a shepherds pie and the no-cheese cheese cake - every dish hit the spot. My date had the chicken pot pie and demolished it before I had even eaten half of mine. (BONUS: We were given extra bread to dip into the gobsmackingly good marinara sauce of the mussels.)  But I think what really made the evening were the staff. Rarely do you get such friendly and welcoming service from ALL waiters. Especially when you're a measly student, it's always nice to not be reminded that you're subsisting on a student budget.   I will definitely be going back soon.   P.S. GET THE NO-CHEESE CHEESECAKE. It will change your life. nomnomnom."}
{"text":"Sooo... I know that people are all \"don't review new places harshly! they are new!\" But my experience here was the weirdest, most confusing dining experience I have ever had.   Also, I should point out that I recently started watching a lot of Gordon Ramsay shows, so while I am forgiving of mix-ups that are corrected, I'm less inclined to be ok with those that are not. On the flip-side, I was also a waitress myself for years, so I understand that shit happens sometimes.  Here's a point form synopsis:  -Server got visibly angry/had a mini-rant at us about his co-workers 'stealing' the coffee when he was the one who had brewed it. I get that that would be irritating, but it made us super uncomfortable.  -Food took almost an hour, and then was wrong.   -Manager comped food, which was great, but then noone brought us our bill for about 20 mins after we were done, so it became a confusing guessing game about whether they had also comped our coffees.   -The dining room was really well staffed and not that busy, but we were often ignored. We kept trying to flag down either our server or the manager when we wanted to pay to leave, but they just scanned the other three tables, then went back to wiping down the bar.   -The wait staff are SUPER noobs. They don't really seem to have any idea how a dining room runs, or what serving professionallly looks like. I'm fine with casual, but this was awkward. The whole dining room seemed like it was being run by teens at their first jobs.  -French fry salad was delicious, but veggie club was boring and awful. Bland, untoasted, skimpy amount of veg slathered in way too much mayo. They might have rushed it, since this was the dish that they had to remake (they accidentally gave us chicken). Pro-tip - if someone is waiting for over an our for a vegetable sandwich, please take the time and care to make it properly.   Overall, brunch took well over two hours. Not in a good way. I know that this review will probaby make me sound like a high maintenance a-hole, but this is one of the worst, most awkard feeling service experiences I have ever had in my life.   Really wanted to love this place, because the menu looks so awesome; I might be back for their dollar an ounce wine on a slow weeknight, but probably not for food.  end rant."}
{"text":"Came to this place for Saturday morning brunch.  Cafeteria-style setup with lots small tables. Great food and excellent staff. Great brunch menu."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the treetop patio! It's super cute, cozy, and comfortable, definitely a hidden gem. Came here with my two best friends and the three of us shared a nice bottle of wine and appetizers (mussles with flat bread and salad rolls). Wine was reasonably priced and appetizers were fresh and tasty. I took off two stars however for the main entrees as it was fairly bland and nothing special. We ordered the green curry bowl, steak & potatoes, and another bowl that resembled a messy burrito. Hopefully the owners can see this review and try to work on improving the food because the place's got so potential!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for lunch last week for the first time and we both left very happy.   We went around 1:00 on a weekday, and the place was about half-full. We were able to be served and paid within an hour, no problem at all. The staff did comment that the day before at the same time it was packed, so sounds like we just lucked out with timing.   Overall, the food was extremely fresh, had a lot of flavor, and plates were fair portions for the price. The chicken, avocado, bacon jam sandwich was really delicious, super soft bread - a real hit.   The wait staff was extremely friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Rooftop patio with trees, healthy delicious food... what's there not to love about this place? It was packed when I went on a weekday summer evening. The atmosphere is casual, making it perfect for a low-key gathering.  Caveat: Be prepared for slow service. However, as long as you don't have other plans after your meal, you should be fine."}
{"text":"It's not fair to write a review when a place just opened, right?  Even when the service is awesome and the food is completely yum, there are glitches and things to be worked out, right?  So:  I'll tell you the glitches and you decide.   We arrived just after noon and were seated right away.   After our drink orders were taken we spent a bit of time deciding on our meals, which was fun because we had lots of vegetarian choices.  My companion had the \"No-Meat Meatball Melt 'wich\"[$9.95], three large barley/lentil/mushroom/onion 'meatballs' covered in tomato marinara and melted cheddar on a bun, with a side of russet fries.  Even our toddler in the high chair gave a big 'wow' for these 'meatballs' and fries.    I had the Korean bowl of barley, basmati rice, daikon pickle, shitake mushrooms, zucchini [I admit, I thought it was cucumber], nuts, and spicy sauce [$10.95].  I was told to mix everything together really well before eating it.  Tiny glitch #1: the menu says this dish includes a sunny side up egg but I didn't find it in mine.  Everything was so tasty, crunchy, toothsome and good that I didn't miss it at all, although next time I will ask.    Water was refilled throughout our stay, napkins were replenished often [see aforementioned toddler], and we were made to feel very welcome indeed. Oh, yes, we had dessert:  the no-cheese cheesecake [$6.50] with a scoop of saucy blueberries on top.  The cheesecake was very creamy and light, the blueberries were just right; we all shared it and agreed it was a fitting end to our meal.  Our bill came and although I didn't notice until we'd left, there was tiny glitch #2: If you have a sandwich, then soup, salad or fries on the side is listed as $3.95, but we were charged the \"Sides\" price of $5.45.    Two tiny glitches which I bet would have been remedied had we pointed them out.  And an awesome experience overall."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent food. Good variety of drink choices. And the dessert took my dinner to another level. The price: $18 daily special. $7 Spirit tree apple lager $7 dessert. The total is about $35 (tax included)  I ordered a veggie meal from the chalkboard. It's red pepper, cheese, eggplant, mushroom and kale, all wrapped with a rice paper. The flavour is so good. I'm normally a meat eater but I enjoy the meal so much. The dessert I had was chocolate pudding with whipped cream. I like how the cream smooth the taste of dark chocolate. It's a must try for chocolate lovers.  They have daily specials on different days. I look forward coming back to try another dish. (And probably another chocolate pudding.)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch, our order took forever to come (we just ordered salad and a soup!).  Once we reminded them, the food came right away.  I ordered a kale salad and the african peanut soup, and both were very tasty.  Usually, I prefer more savory (meat) dishes, but I was surprised to find myself enjoying my meal!  The patio on the second floor is nice, and I would definitely recommend others to come."}
{"text":"My gf and I visited Harvest Kitchen for brunch after reading positive reviews both here and on blog TO. We love brunch, especially when it's within walking distance! Like other reviewers, we noticed there were a few snags here and there. But let's start with the good: We walked in around 11:30, and were seated immediately. The restaurant was about 3/4 full at that point (and would fill up completely by the time we left). It's a bit bigger than our other nearby brunch go-to's, which should work in its favour. The ambiance is nice - cozy and a little bit rustic, with vintage-y furniture and lots of thought to the little details. Our server was great - very attentive and eager to please, though clearly quite new. The owners (I assume) were also on hand, and were checking in with patrons from time to time.   My gf had the HK Club'wich with fries. She was very impressed, and I can confirm from the bite that I stole that it was quite tasty. A great combination of flavours, and a generous portion.   I ordered the Baked Niagara French Toast with extremely high hopes. Challah bread, cream cheese, peaches, blueberries and walnuts? Yes please! Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as fond of my dish. The presentation was cute - a little iron pot filled to the brim with what looked like a mini casserole. The top was nice and crispy, but I was disappointed by the soggy contents beneath - more of a wet bread pudding than anything. The flavours were good, but everything had kind of muddled together. While the presentation was definitely unique, I would have preferred a more conventional pan-fried French toast with the same flavours.   On the topic of things that could be improved: while enthusiastic, the service was a bit relaxed. Right now, HK has the luxury of time - they're not dealing with a line out the door, so it's not a huge deal that coffee wasn't on the table with 5 mins of us sitting down. But in a month or two, those minutes will be pretty vital.  There are also some glitches with their payment system that I've seen noted elsewhere. Even though many of the breakfast items come with a side, an additional charge is added for the (theoretically included) side. In our case, my gf was charged for the full amount of her meal, plus the cost of a side of fries - even though a side was included with her meal. I'm sure this would have been dealt with had we mentioned it, but my gf didn't want to cause a fuss. I expect this glitch will be corrected by the time we return - which we will! We're excited to try the dinner menu, and even to go back for brunch in another month or two.  While they're clearly still working out the kinks, HK has great promise, and we're looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Service is great!  I loved the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff.  We went for brunch and ordered the classic eggs bennie, black and green kale bennie, and the mushroom french fry salad.    Everyone thought their meal was excellent and thought it was the best hollandaise sauce we've had in a long time.  Note that only the classic eggs bennie comes on an English muffin.   They also have a really cute patio upstairs."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at HK for the first time in a while. My mistake. Better than ever! Can I rate it 7/5?! The four of us started with a wild mushroom \"Sproutzza\" as an appetizer. Delicious. We didn't want the Borgonzola cheese on it, and so asked our server to let the kitchen decide what to replace it with ... did I say delicious already? Definitely go for a Sproutzza -- either shared or as a meal. A truly unique offering. For our mains, after much deliberation (it all looks so good!) we settled on one Bolognese, two grass-fed HK burgers (one with fries; one with a squash soup special), and one duck special. Everything was delicious. I've said that already, I know. We had a great time sharing bites and tastes. The Bolognese was perfect and fulfilling on a cold December evening. The HK burger... well I doubt you'll find a tastier one anywhere in the city. Definitely won't find better fries anywhere. Haven't had better anywhere. Period. Good thing my daughter was feeling generous with her fries! The duck special was beautifully prepared, and came with gorgeously grilled vegetables... I pinched a Brussel Sprout... and then several more from my partner. She was happy to swap for some Bolognese, so all was good. Okay. Enough about the food. Can't say enough about the servers either. Great touch. Really know how to make your experience enjoyable. Thank you HK for making a great meal a great experience. I won't make the same mistake again; will be back long before \"a while\" has passed!"}
{"text":"I wish I could write a better review as this is one of my daughter's favourite spots near her home in Toronto. While everyone else at our table enjoyed their meal (2 kale egg bennies, a super breakfast and a breakfast burrito), I did not enjoy mine, and probably should have sent it back. I ordered a spinach eggs bennie with home fries. It was not hot, the eggs were undercooked, with some runny whites, and the home fries soggy and swimming in grease. I have had various forms of Eggs Benedict at various restaurants, including Kalendar (which were superb) and these would have to be the worst! The latte was excellent, the service great and I loved that everything was market to table, but would hesitate to try again and could not recommend."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years now, and got married on the patio a few summers ago. Breakfast is always perfect, dinner menu is always solid and specials are on point.  Summertime go spend a weekend morning in the treehouse upstairs in the sunshine! Service is authentic and always friendly. AND they made their own honey on the roof last year!"}
{"text":"Waiters don't seems like they enjoy working here. Slow service for coffee,  water. Eggs were not cooked to request. Nice patio but the rest is not worth it"}
{"text":"Very undercooked \"French toast\" (in a bowl?!) was more akin to SOUP, horrible breakfast absolutely swimming in horrid bean juice, small portions, incredibly over priced beverages, VERY slow service, seating, ordering and receiving were over 2 hours (despite there being over 15 staff members present--I counted), several servers were polishing glasses while we were kept waiting and waiting and waiting...and 2 other actively complaining customers.  Not at all busy; there were only 3 other seated tables in the dining room, and perhaps 3 other tables in the rest of the warren of rooms. About 2 pm on a Saturday. Obviously over-priced, even without the above issues.  Unbelievably awful experience.  And the bathrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen has my favorite roof top patio in Toronto! Although I don't frequent this city as much as I should, whenever I am able to visit the beautiful city of Toronto, this is my number 1 stop. Not only is the food amazing, but the bartender can really recommend a great drink! The kale salad with steak is a must, along with the vegetable dumplings and carrot cake. Don't forget to check the weekly specials which are always to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 8 times, both for lunch and dinner. Every time they manage to screw something up. Always late serving the food. Missing dishes. If you come here be prepared to wait and wait or worse, not get your good at all. Also, check your bill carefully, once they over charged me by adding a dish I didn't have. Amateur service but the food is ok, nothing special. Just don't expect much. Patio is nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Harvest Kitchen!  We were visiting Toronto with friends who are vegetarians and so this place was perfect.  Everyone had good choices.  We started with the Dukkah which was very nice.  I had the fish which was cooked perfectly. The service was outstanding- so much care taken to make sure everyones dietary restrictions were met- I really was impressed.  Cute decor and great staff! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a delicious duck confit on Swiss chard. Mine was the first order of the night it took a little longer so they gave us free dumplings while we waited. A+ food and service."}
{"text":"So, this review is for a takeout meal that I ordered this evening.  I ordered the peanut soup and the chickpea quinoa pasta. Both dishes were very underwhelming, The peanut soup tasted slightly burnt and lacked any real flavor; overall pretty bland.   The quinoa pasta had some nice flavor and texture going for it but it tasted like someone poured salt onto it and the lid of the salt container accidentally fell off. This dish was buried in salt. Seriously, cut it back.  The restaurant itself seemed pretty nice and the boys in their checkered plaid shirts gave off a \"harvesty\" vibe, I guess.   A final thing that peeved me a bit, though. There was a .25 cent surcharge for plastic cutlery. Who, in the entire history of take-out food, has ever NOT wanted plastic cutlery along with their order? I mean isn't the whole idea of take-out that you can eat at home but not have to do the dishes when you're done? C'mon.   Bottom line, I spent $25 for a meal that left me extremely unhappy. I would really love to say good things about this place as it seems all \"positive-healthy-organic and free rangey.\" Hopefully with time they'll step it up a bit."}
{"text":"Lovely place. We had early dinner in the patio. I got veggie lasagna, and it tasted amazing! I will be back for a brunch in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants I would definitely recommend my friends and family to come!  Everything is home made.  I was lucky that I got to enjoy the fish of the day dish!  The seared tuna side dished with the kale made with their special sauce is just delicious!  Love the place!"}
{"text":"The only reason why this gets 2 stars is because of the nice waiters. My party of 4 came in for Saturday brunch. The food was really bland- I had a breakfast burrito with egg apparently, although I didn't taste or see it. My soup was tasteless too. My friends also thought the food lacked seasoning/salt. Don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch. Unfortunately, this place looks way better than it tastes. We ordered the eggs benny and a single pancake. As other reviews mentioned, service took forever (20 min. to order, 1 hour to get our food), and there were some empty tables while we were there. When the food came...we could not tell how it took that long to make. We can't recommend this place to anyone, sorry."}
{"text":"What's up with the 'manager' at this place? Not friendly, doesn't smile and I witnessed her serving food to tables that came in after us yet we had the same thing?? Maybe they are regulars but that is bs.  Anyhow I do like this place a lot. The burger is delicious as is the kale salad. Tried a couple of bites of their shepherds pie and it was very tasty. Breakfast burritos are quite good (maybe a little more flavor/seasoning?) and the hollandaise is excellent. Friendly staff (other than the manager) too and no complaints about their service.  To the Yelper who arrives on a Sunday at NOON for brunch and then complains about wait times, you are an idiot. People who go out to eat (especially brunch on a Sunday) and are in a hurry are the worst. Stay home and make toast or hit McDonalds if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend and absolutely loved it- we returned the next night with my family! The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, with good service and a great location. The food was fantastic, I recommend the burgers, and don't miss out on dessert! I can't wait for our next dinner here."}
{"text":"After a dinner with friends a few weeks back, we liked it so much that we decided to have a birthday party for 15 of our friends in one of the private rooms upstairs. The restaurant worked closely with us in advance to create a menu that satisfied each of our guests and the multiple restrictions that they required. They did not disappoint! Everyone commented on how yummy everything was. I especially loved the dip platter, the fried pickles (yum!) and the burger with the bun from Harbord Bakery across the street. We also LOVED the Detox cocktails. The prices are reasonable and the service was attentive. I look forward to coming back again and to checking out the second floor outdoor patio in the summer."}
{"text":"I really love this place: I've been here four times, and every time I've been really happy with the meals. The decor is pretty simple, but the service has always been very friendly and accessible--I sheepishly asked for the \"cheapest red wine\" on my first visit, and the server was completely non-judgmental about it and brought me a little taste of the wine first to see if I would like it (which I know is standard, but doesn't usually happen when you ask for \"the cheapest,\" ha! Its nice to be treated well even when you are upfront about being a little broke). The food feels kind of fancy, but is really very delicious.   This place always has very delicious options for both vegetarians and meat-eaters. My boyfriend is vegetarian and I eat meat, and this is one of the best places I've found in Toronto where we are both totally happy with the choices. The vegetarian options here aren't lazy like there are in so many other places that serve meat: the veggie choices are always creative and flavorful, not just \"the other meals but with tofu instead of meat.\" We went for a holiday dinner, and the vegetarian option was this insanely delicious sort of deconstructed ratatouille--so good. The burger is great as well!  Highly recommended--the pleasant service, delicious food, and reasonable prices make it a great spot to have a nice date without feeling stress about the cost or the environment."}
{"text":"The green curry bowl and cold broccoli & asparagus soup just sent my tastebuds to another dimension. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Why have I not put fries, mushroom and salad in my mouth at the same time for the utmost tastebud pleasure until Harvest Kitchen? How can no one else have thought of this genius creation?  I would nearly give this place a 5 because I enjoyed the experience so much, but I'll have to come again to see if they are truly a five-star establishment. We were here for dinner and had a thumbs-up experience! It was crowded and we had to stand by for a table for a few minutes, but they were attentive to us from the very beginning. When we got a table, we also got a super awesome server - one of those people who just makes you feel happy about your choices, and makes you feel like you're the best customers s/he has ever served before!   As mentioned above, the Mushroom French-Fry Salad blew our taste buds away. I would highly recommend that you give this a try! Feel bad about eating fries while you feel good about eating a salad! ;)  For the entrées, we had a Moroccan stew and burgers. Unfortunately, these were just average but I really enjoyed the pickles, so the server brought out a side of pickles just for us. Good guy server.  There were some selections of wine and beer but I was excited that they had Stiegl Radler on tap when we went. Perfect addition to my hearty meal.  Atmosphere - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"AMAZING food, every time.  We love going there and will keep supporting them as they are a true gem.  The service is incredible too.... Each member of staff, from servers to owners, were involved, accommodating and friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner for 'girls night'. Upon entry we were encouraged to go upstairs to the rooftop balcony. We were not disappointed. It is absolutely beautiful. It feels like an oasis in the middle of the busy city, I almost forgot I was on Harbord street during rush hour.   The waiter was friendly and attentive. He made a lot of eye contact which I appreciated. He was very genuine.   I ordered the Meatless Meatballs, which were absolutely delightful. I've never had anything like that, very unique. I also loved the healthy drink options.  Awesome atmosphere, great experience."}
{"text":"Slow for what should be a regular Sunday Brunch crowd. Cancelled our food...due to the ridiculous wait. Still charged us for the mimosas. .  Visiting from LA. Never again!!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. It's a bit pricey if you're on a budget, but it's worth the occasional splurge.  They have AMAZING appetizers, like the hummus, dukkah, and tempura house pickles. The kebabs are great too!  Sides like the mushroom French fry salad and the russet fries are great, as well as their beers.  The only thing my friends and I found was that their sides, appetizers, desserts, and drinks were great, but their main courses were just \"good\".  Either way, they have some really unique things there and I would advise everyone to try once!  Please note, though- it's rather loud and crowded, and there may be a little bit of a wait for tables."}
{"text":"Had the poached eggs and mushrooms here - not too bad. Pretty good dish. The place is quaint and good for a pleasant conversation. Overall good impression, might be a little on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. African peanut soup was my favourite, something I hadn't tried before. I would book a table if you can, it was fairly busy."}
{"text":"Casual yet charming. You must try the roof top patio. I admire their commitment to quality ingredients - you can really taste it in their food! Good choice of brunch cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"They are wonderful! Great food, even the gluten free was excellent! Such sweet wait staff too - they put my friend's birthday flowers in a vase for her during dinner and helped wrap them back up after! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you go to Harvest Kitchen and it's a nice weather day, go up to the rooftop patio!  It's surrounded by trees and is shaded and makes you feel like you're in cottage country.    The food has a lot of vegetarian options which I like.  I ended up having the baked french toast, which was a challah bun soaked in the french toast custard and stuffed with cream cheese and baked.  It looks average-sized but is really filling!  The staff was really friendly and attentive as well.  Also, their sparkling water is worth mentioning as well - it's the perfect sparkling water because it has bigger bubbles that don't feel weird in your mouth (I hate Perrier because of their little bubbles and its gross flavor...)"}
{"text":"Can only comment on the brunch. Had the eggs benedict and mushroom salad. Hollandaise sauce was far too buttery and the mushroom salad was covered in oil (same goes for the side of kale salad). Corn pancakes were quite unique but wouldn't say mind-blowing. Overall okay but will need to order some other items to have a better idea of the place."}
{"text":"Just ordered their bolognese and the avocado/sprouts/grilled chicken salad from uber eats. It was AMAZING. The bolognese was one of the best I've ever had. I've seen this place a whole bunch of times and after that order, I look forward to dining in the restaurant itself.  4 stars because I didn't get to experience their in house service but the food was 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and I've got to say the second time was a little disappointing. The restaurant is very cozy and perfect for a Sunday brunch (especially on the upstairs patio in the summer). I've had the poached eggs on mushrooms, kale and french fries both times I've been there. Be warned ti's very savoury and can get a bit heavy near the end, but it is quite different and worth a try! My boyfriend had the Power Breakfast and was pretty disappointed in it and said there was nothing spectacular about it.   Overall it's a very friendly and decently priced neighborhood restaurant for Sunday morning brunch!"}
{"text":"Last night was the 4th or 5th time my wife and I had eaten here. We were addicted to the french fry salad with the small steak. Always excellent. Last night our party of 4 branched out. between us we had the gazpacho soup, the french fry salad of course, a grilled pickerel entree and a roasted duck entree. The fish and duck were spectacular, cooked perfectly, with interesting tasty sauces and garnishes, wonderful delicate veggies from their own farm -actually everything was wonderful. The food was prepared with wonderful ingredients, creative thought and care - and all presented by a friendly and efficient server. The price for the quality was an added benefit.  We have never missed eating here, and last night was a grand slam."}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen has a very strict rule of not seating anyone until all parties are there (which is like most BUSY restaurants downtown) but it surprised me since it had very little customers. There were 3 empty tables in the front patio, downstairs had a few empty tables, the beautiful but wasp-infested rooftop had only 4 tables filled and the room upstairs was completely EMPTY. The service was below average. When our party had all arrived, one of the servers made a snappy comment about us all finally here and then had us seated. On top of that, we were rushed to get out of the restaurant which would be understandable if there were many people waiting but there were no customers.   I give this place 3 stars because the food was alright and the portion size was good. The rooftop is super chill and beautiful on a summer day.   Would I be a returning customer though? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"A-OK, because I liked my meal. Harvest Kitchen is a cute little brunch spot that is- by the looks of it- perfect for Harbord Street. Nice and bright. Plenty of wooden tables and knick knacks.   I started off my meal with a mango lassi smoothie. Quite refreshing with its sweet mango, and I could have used even more cardamom. At 8+ dollars, it's a steep treat but a very large portion.   I have a hard time giving this place a bad review, because I did really like my meal but the service was quite slow for a Sunday brunch. It took record time to get simple things like water and coffee. I wanted to love this place and say nothing, but if you're looking for a hangover helper or timely spot, look elsewhere. You will wait. Not necessarily for a table, but at your table.   Wolfing down my main was pretty much worth the wait. My main brunch item was called a \"benedict\", but it was really french fries with poached eggs on top, hollandaise, spinach, kale and mushrooms. The fries were so nice and crispy. The eggs were perfectly cooked and floated on top. With a bit of hot sauce, this thing was especially crazy. I almost finished it too."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by Harvest Kitchen, but not particularly unhappy by that. In a nutshell, this place takes pretty good ingredients and serves up pretty standard fare.  I found the brunch menu to be unremarkable, the same you'll find over the city. Benedicts, eggs, bacon. The power breakfast being the standard - eggs, bacon, guac. I'm sure there are organic eggs in there, but they taste just like the inorganic (??!?) ones to me.  I'll nod to the pancakes though, which, in a twist, were cornmeal based. Though in execution they were closer to the consistency of a flat cornmeal muffin, I appreciate the effort.   The fruit compote though was the real surprise. This is where the ingredients shined, and in the dead of March these berries were tart and sweet. Quality ingredients, indeed.  Would go back, especially in the summer (I hear the patio is sweet...)"}
{"text":"Great food. I would say most things I've tried you are able to enjoy very well, which means it has a solid menu top to bottom. I really enjoyed their omelette and was able to get a nice substitution from goat cheese to cheddar (had a rough Friday night). On the not so great side is the coffee. I'd go somewhere else to get the necessary caffeine fix. Be wary of a slight wait, but that is par the course for great brunch spots in the city."}
{"text":"We had to wait around an hour to be seated - I think it was just a really busy day and they were understaffed. However the farm to table concept really intrigued me and I decided to wait and try the food out. I usually do not like kale but the black and green kale here is really good and worth a try. I was very impressed with it. The green curry bowl was also good. The side seasonal veggies was nothing special though. The food was pretty good and so was the service. I also tried their dry cider on tap, it was okay. It's a small place, very intimate and cute. They also have a patio but it wasn't opened yet. It was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype surrounding this restaurant. My partner suggested we go to Harvest Kitchen for their rooftop patio.   We ordered several appetizers and drinks. The drinks came quickly, while the food took about 50 minutes. To be fair, the waitress did warn us that the kitchen was \"backed-up.\"   It started raining while we were eating and the waitress paid no interest in offering us a table indoor. She did, however, move all the other clientele from the patio, while continuing to ignore us. Now, if we only had drinks to carry--I really would not have minded as much. We ended up carrying all of our plates, drinks and cutlery downstairs and seating ourselves at the bar. I am still boggled as to why the waitress chose to pay more attention to clients who only had their drinks, as opposed to those who were actually dining.   The food is just okay. Not too bad, but also not amazing.   Our experience would have been better if this restaurant had the slightest idea of how to prioritize and treat their clientele.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 7.5/10  I came here with a large group for a birthday dinner (something I'm sure all restaurants hate and dread). While we are a charming group, it doesn't take away from the constant requests - water refills, napkins, could you check on X, Y and Z?  I decided to order three smaller plates for my meal, including: - dukkah (their version of bread with a variety of dips) - Thai soba noodle - a chicken skewer and tofu skewer  The dukkah was fine. I'm trying to think back on it and nothing really stands out, so while it didn't make a fantastic impact, I didn't hate it either.  The Thai soba noodle was good. It was light and refreshing, and just the perfect balance for the heavier bread from the dukkah. I would recommend.  The skewers were meh. It felt like something I could have done on my George Foreman at home, and I don't even have a George Foreman!  So while the food was okay/good, and the service was above average (we ended up inviting the waiter to go karaoking with us...), I'm still giving this place a 3/5 stars. Reason being that there are tons of these kinds of restaurants in Toronto. They all seem to have the same characteristics, and its making it hard to pin one as a cut above the rest.   They are always smaller, have a quaint atmosphere, include a bartender who's really into mixology but will still make you a vodka cran, something on their menu describes local or organic or farm to table cuisine, and quite frankly, they're not that cheap. Sorry for the haterade, but I think they, and Torontonians, can do much better.   THE BOTTOM LINE: food is your usual slightly hipster, slightly above average meal in your very regular setting."}
{"text":"In an effort to enjoy what few rays of sunshine we've had so far this year, my partner and I decided to visit on a whim to enjoy their outside seating area.  To be fair, we did only order coffees. The rest of the menu did look enticing, but after paying close to $10 (factoring in tax) for two weak and milky cappuccinos, we didn't want to tempt fate further.  It was a nice enough location (the street can be a little bit noisy), and inside was lovely, but overall was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went for brunch on New Year's Day. Of course we expected it to be busy, but were still disappointed with the experience. We first waited at least 45  minutes in the front of the restaurant for a table. When finally seated, we were told there was no coffee left. Once we put in our order, we had to wait for almost an hour and a half to be served, at which point it was almost 4pm. The food ordered (the power breakfast and breakfast burrito) were both very bland and lacked flavour. Everyone agreed that we should have been warned about the wait prior to being seated, and the staff could and should have been more apologetic or accommodating about the experience. Would never again return on what might be a busy day."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Their brunch is fantastic- I really recommend it! I have to commend them on their service too. Everyone is always so friendly. Also, the French fries: probably the best I've had."}
{"text":"sat on the rooftop patio which was so nice! it was private and serene but also small so it can definitely fill up quick. service and food were both quick and the taste of the food was great as well. you could tell they care about the quality of the food they serve. great vegan options as well"}
{"text":"If you want good service don't come here. Slow hostess, 3 people walk by us at the bar and not a word."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait forever for your food. It took them 50 minutes to bring out a single plain pancake and it was drier than my feelings for this place.  I saw multiple tables complain about the service.  The same server came to the table beside me twice to ask if the same beer was theirs. 3 tables walked in and immediately walked out. I wish I did the same.  My glass of water was left empty for 20 minutes before someone filled it up. I watched my french toast takeout order sit on the bar long before the food arrived at my table. This place is an absolute mess! Based on this experience, I would give this restaurant 0 stars for brunch but yelp forced me to at least give 1 (too generous in my opinion).   When the mains finally arrived 1 hour later (yes 1 hour no exaggerations) it came with a side of apologies and 1 free Caesar. Too bad about the service because the food is actually really tasty, fresh and unique. The mushroom french fry Benedict is like the best breakfast poutine I've had.  I really hope this restaurant was just having a bad day and that it's not always like this."}
{"text":"The waiters and bartenders I've had were always super sweet guys. They always checked in on us and were very friendly and warm whenever we had any questions. My friends beer took too long and they even gave her a discount on it. I love how super healthy this place is! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Neat, comfy patio. Pleasing menu. Gracious service."}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen has the right ingredients and perfect for the location on Harbord St. They have a few nice draught beer selections and wine by the oz. too. The dining room is cozy with an excellent view of both the quiet street, and way more fun, the kitchen in the back. There is a long marble bar (nice touch) and a second floor which would be best for larger groups. The menu is nicely built but lacks pizazz that you would find in a trendier spot and there's no DJ pumping out the tunes. It could be described as comfort food typical in Toronto, made fresh and with care providing you with a perfectly satisfying evening (we went for dinner). Service was excellent and we felt catered to in all ways, drinks, fantastic food with beautiful presentation prepared fresh in a reasonable time. The server even offered to split the bill, in case, uh, it wasn't working out with Phiippe, José, or whatever his name was and you could ditch your date at the door. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Going to a restaurant is an experience. The enjoyment of food is more than just the straight up taste - the smell, the ambiance, and the service all matter.  Unfortunately our trip was a disaster. Not only did it take them roughly 45 minutes to seat us (from the initial estimate of 15-20m), but the food took over an hour to arrive.  This is no exaggeration - we were given complimentary dumplings (nice gesture, except half of our party has been diagnosed with celiac disease), and our other appetizers were also comped. But we were repeatedly told that our food would just be out... I felt like a scene from The Princess Bride where you want to say \"you keep using that word but I don't think you know what it means.\"  The food itself was simply OK. I had the chicken taco bowl, and it was about eh as it comes - the chicken was dry, the veggies were haphazard.  I really wanted to like this place, but it simply did not deliver (the waitstaff WAS still very nice)."}
{"text":"This place can get busy busy but if you want to enjoy a great Ontario-sourced brunch, this is a spot you should definitely visit.  So far I've tried the mushroom & french fries eggs benedict, the pancakes and the grilled chicken sandwich. I'd say one of the stars in the menu are definitely the eggs benny, there's a lot going on in that dish - loved how perfectly the eggs were cooked, really enjoyed the crunchy kale on it and the earthy flavour of the mushrooms.  The pancakes were awesome too, I tried the corn and millet gluten free pancakes - they felt light and healthy but were really fluffy and pancake-y at the same time.   A very cute spot with a really cool artsy upstairs area too (I really love the deco). One of my go-to options for good brunching!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for a dinner get together on a Wednesday evening. The venue was so relaxing and calm. The service was great, however, the food was not. I had a chicken pot pie with fries on the side and the chicken pot pie was not solid, it was basically \"soup\" in a clay pot with \"pie\" covering on top. It was too sweet and was not flavorful. My girlfriend also ordered a Kale salad with Tofu and the tofu tasted stale like it was sitting around for a week or 2. Unfortunately, I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend and found the place to be a charming little joint.  Our waitress had perfected the art of 'bantering' and it's always pleasantly surprising when people know just how much it elevates the dining experience.   We started off with some lovely tea (Earl Grey ofcourse) and it was served in a fashionable kettle and classy looking cup and saucer. It was one of the most delicious and fragrant teas I've had in a really long time especially after the crap Timmy's and Starbucks shoves down our throats.   Then my friend ordered the burritos and I ordered some mushroom filled fried dumplings and we washed it down with some wonderful soup. The special soup changes every day but we had a parsnip and celery soup with brown rice in it. It was mildly seasoned and just what i needed after the oily and spicy dumplings.   All in all a good restaurant. The serving sizes were a bit small, personally. And the food did take a while to arrive and it wasn't even that busy at first."}
{"text":"Service slow, although was busy for Sunday brunch. Poached eggs came bordering on hard boiled, although specifically asked for soft, runny yolks. Food was like warm when it finally arrived. Looks like it has a nice garden patio but not sure I would rush back."}
{"text":"This place is ultra expensive, the portion is small and the service is incredibly slow and sub-par. I am never coming here again, which is sad because I was really looking forward to the food. I'm a super sucker for fresh and local ingredients, but what in the ACTUAL fuck did I just eat?    I came here with my BF on a Tuesday at 2. I got the organic chicken and avocado salad for 16 dollars. I think the majority of my salad was a mix bought from Loblaws. I think my chicken was sliced up from half a chicken breast, just seasoned with some salt and pepper, and there was one avocado in the salad. Too expensive for some mediocre food I could make myself. And the worst part was that we waited 40 minutes for the food to come. There was only one waitress and she constantly forgot about us or had more attention to the other customers. I can excuse the poor service if the food was good, but it wasn't. It wasn't filling and it was way overpriced.   Again, I would never come here again and I'm not sure how and why this place has such a high rating. As of now, this restaurant is THE worst review I have on Yelp.  TLDR; Slow service, mediocre food, pricey meals. 2 stars is true. I've experienced much better."}
{"text":"I liked it here! Very mellow atmosphere like your in an old house, but definitely gets lively at night and they put a lovely playlist on full blast!service was fast and friendly. They have nightly specials which ads great-4$ drinks and 5$ pints as well as  specials on snacks to share. It's a nice atmosphere to go to post work for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Nice space, friendly service.  Great option if you're dining with a vegetarian, or if you live in the neighbourhood.  The peanut butter smoothie was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place for Sunday brunch, and it was pretty good. The food wasn't outstanding, but for the most part it was pretty tasty. I loved the loose leaf black tea I got and liked the french toast I ordered, however it wasn't evenly heated all the way through - some parts were hot, some parts were cold - and the amount of cream cheese inside was a bit overwhelming. I enjoyed the mango Lassi shake but it should have been called a plain Lassi cause I didn't taste any mango, and thought their grilled cheese was not nearly cheesy enough (although my date said he liked it a lot himself). The waitress was very nice and full of cheeky personality, and I appreciated that she warned us about having to wait a while for our food to come out because they were busy. However, it took a long time to get the bill and then a long time to get the machine to pay our bill.   I would go back again, it was definitely a cute place with pretty good food, but it didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and incredible food. I had the grass fed burger and kale salad. Really delicious. The wine on tap is okay if you are not too picky about your wine -- if you are they have options the menu. Patio is awesome but seating inside is also nice."}
{"text":"Based on limited experience A-OK food but GREAT setting and concept.   My mother and I enjoyed a post TIFF screening brunch of:  Baked Niagara French Toast- blueberry, peach & cream cheese filled Harbord St. Bakery Challah Bun , maple syrup sweet'n spicy walnuts (10.95)  Grilled Chicken Sandwich - grilled chicken, bacon maple jam, avocado, lettuce, tomato, roasted red pepper mayo, red onions,toasted Manoucher Herb Teekeh Bun, choice of side salad, soup or fries (11.45)   My mom got the soup and it was a deliciously fresh tasting and textured gazpacho.   5 stars for the tree-covered patio room!! Absolutely lovely. I also dig the enthusiastic website and community farming aspect of Harvest Kitchen's vision."}
{"text":"Super cute place with some cute waiters, but the food is nothing crazy. We started with the mushroom french fry salad which was actually really good! The mushrooms were delicious and the portion was great to split between 3 people as an app.  For the main I had the vegetarian pot pie which also came with a small side salad.  This pie is a LIE.  A pie is assumed to have a pastry lining the dish and on top.  Well this only had the filling, with no pie bottom or sides and then a pastry layer on top.  WTF? So basically there was no real crust. okayyyy really not cool. I would never order this again.  Also, we were seated upstairs and the restaurant was SUPER loud and we were basically screaming at each other to talk."}
{"text":"Hosted a work dinner party here with the help of the manager Kevin! All I can say is WOW! I cannot express the gratitude I have for all the hard work that was put into making our event a special one. We had a few picky eaters in our group and Kevin was sure to give us a menu that covered all the bases. However, there was still one member that couldn't eat anything on our menu and the kitchen went out of their way to prepare something special for him using their fresh ingredients that he could actually eat. Knocked it out of the park! Wine was delicious and everyone enjoyed their food immensely. I did not hear one complaint at a full table of picky lawyers!  The french fries were actually the best I have ever had. The fried pickles (and other vegetables) were good but I tried a colleague's peanut soup and next time I will be getting that! I had the steak and fries as my main and for the price ($20.95) I was expecting not a great steak but man was I wrong. The steak was delicious and perfectly cooked! I will be seeing you again very soon! Thank you so much for such a memorable party with delicious and fresh food! Everyone left smiling :) (They made me look so good to my colleagues and boss I am practically a work legend now!)"}
{"text":"I went to this place for brunch and had a nice experience.    I had the Mushroom French fry Benedict...holy smokes it was reeeaaally good and my boyfriend had the Benny with back bacon which he also enjoyed.  The restaurant itself is cozy and the staff are friendly.  I definitely will return"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The food doesn't come out quick, but definitely worth the wait. I think they have a strict policy on the rooftop for only seating when your whole party is there.  Great choices for vegetarians and enough for meat eaters too."}
{"text":"Reading their reviews made me nervous planning to arrive here at 12 (as some yelpers said they had to wait an hour for seating). However, when my friends arrived, we were seated right away up stairs in the patio - which was almost full.  Their weekend brunch menu is pretty cute. I got the bacon n organic eggs which included two eggs, an english muffin, home fries, and Pemeal bacon. Okay, so just now I was looking at their menu to describe the dish and realized they forgot to include the english muffin with my order. The first time, I received my plate, they took it back because they forgot to give me the eggs. The second time, I just realized, they forgot my english muffin (see pictures). Wahh. The sunny side up egg was really good, cooked perfectly. And I enjoyed the peameal bacon (which the server recommended and it was definitely good!). I also liked how the home fries weren't super salty and it was good with ketchup. In addition, I got their latte which comes in a big cup for $4.55 which is a pretty sweet deal. Make sure to ask about their coffee if you want brunch with coffee!  I enjoyed the service here a lot where all the servers were very friendly and nice. Atmosphere is popping too! I just wished my meal was complete."}
{"text":"This used to be our favourite brunch spot in the city. They take ages to bring the food but when they do, it used to be worth the wait. However it seems they've lost their chef recently and with him/her any taste, flavour and quality. Both of the last two times, we had to return dishes (eggs too cold/ eggs over cooked/ burrito missing ingredients). The breakfast burrito specifically, used to ooze flavour and texture, now it seems mostly filled with just a bland mix of rice and beans.   Staff always very friendly, and happy to replace dishes with a look on their faces like this seems to be a trend of returned dishes these days. After the last two lacklustre experiences, sadly we won't be coming here anymore. I hope they do something to revive this place to the great kitchen it used to be.   Two stars for the friendly staff, drinks and juices. No stars for the food."}
{"text":"Really dig this place. Fun food, not too expensive for Harbord, classy, yet casual and cozy. Really stoked that I live across from it."}
{"text":"Bumping up a star after another visit. After inhaling drinks, snacks, shared plates and dinner over the course of a couple hours, the last thing you need is the buzzkill of figuring out how to split a bill. HK makes it happen in a flash - they just punch it in and easily break down which things were for the table and which things were separate (our server credited their technology). Perfect calculations, no stress, no awkwardness. Why isn't it like this everywhere? On top of that you can pay with PayPal on your phone - can you make it any easier to TAKE ALL MY MONEY?!?  I wasn't a big fan of the mushroom fry salad ($9.5) that is mentioned in other reviews though. It was basically a smallish bowl of fries (good fries!) with some very scant, well, mushrooms and greens. Not enough of the \"salad\" that the menu suggests. Wouldn't get that again but there's plenty more to try.  Still love that patio, yo."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!   We've been three or four times and most recently got the smoothies to go - the brunch, dinner, and smoothies are all great.  Can't go wrong with any dishes, especially the burgers, hmmmm.  This place is a must go and a great addition to Harbord street.    hmmm need a smoothie right now..."}
{"text":"Nice place, but service was very slow. Seated 10 minutes before having to ask for water - our power breakfasts arrived a full 40 minutes after we sat down. Food was good - great guacamole, but let down by speed. No coffee refill though other tables were offered them. Won't rush back, but it's a good spot if you brought a book and aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came for dinner during opening week and the staff were amazingly friendly and the food delicious... we all ordered different mains and a few appetizers to share and everyone loved what they got. I was the only vegetarian in the group, and there were loooots of great menu options for me, which was rare. Even the meat eaters loved it all too.   We came back for brunch yesterday, and I think I love their brunch menu even more - one of the best I've seen in the city. Lots of juice + smoothie options (want to try them all) and all your classic breakfast options, but taken up a notch with seasonal and homemade ingredients. We tried the breakfast burrito, which was deeeeelicious.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen is one of those spaces where a vegetarian can freely eat with their non-vegetarian friends without worrying about the lack of options.  A great bonus is that it's located in close proximity to Almond Butterfly and  other shops with vegan, gluten-free, and/or vegetarian fare.  Therefore, it's worth including Harvest Kitchen in a food crawl in the area.   Decor-wise, it has a cozy ''cluttered'' atmosphere that makes it great for more intimate meals.  To make it even more extra, there is even an old fashion rotary phone near the washrooms!  My gripes are surprisingly with the food.  Please keep in mind that it will take an unusually long time for your meals to arrive.  Two weeks ago, it took 40 minutes for my burger to be served.  Seeing as there were only three occupied tables at the time, I just can't fathom how the staff manages when it's a full house!  In addition, the food is priced on the more expensive side but is of average quality. For example, despite the few raves about the russet fries, they didn't stand out, and the Spaghetti Bolognese had more meat and sauce than pasta, thus creating an unbalanced composition of textures.  I, unfortunately, would have second thoughts about returning. A meal here, with the excessive wait for food and the unbalanced price to quality ratio, is more exploratory than tantalizing. If you are in fact visiting, my two cents are to order the burger. It's the best bang for your buck here in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times have really enjoyed myself - the patio is fantastic and the food does not disappoint. Both times my breakfast has been delicious (an omelette the first time, and eggs/tofu bacon/sides the second time). The service is pleasant and relatively fast considering it is quite busy here.  Good eats."}
{"text":"Farm to Table HARVEST KITCHEN  Harvest Kitchen ***complimentary meal from Zomato***  Address: 124 Harbord Street (Spadina & Bloor) Access: Along TTC street car route, street parking available Price: ~$15 per person Blogsters' Rating: 4.5/5  Hi guys!   I recently got a treat from Zomato - a complimentary meal to Harvest Kitchen! We all know that if a restaurant is Zomato recommended, it had to be good. I immediately went online to check them out, and found that Harvest Kitchen believes in high quality ingredients.  Using the phrase \"Farm to Table\" would be best to describe them.  They use grass fed ground beef, Ocean Wise certified seafood, organic free range eggs, and natural / unrefined veggies when available.  After some in-depth research, we couldn't wait to pay them a visit.  Harvest Kitchen is one of the newly renovated buildings in the area.  With a bright orange sign, it's hard to miss them.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to have a seat on the patio because the weather was too cold.  However, the decorations inside the restaurant were very cozy and welcoming.  All of the staff were wearing jeans with plaid shirts, which added a more country / rural feel to the whole venue.  They were nice, friendly, and without a doubt provided the best customer service you could find in Toronto. Initially, I wanted to order the \"Revive\", but unfortunately they did not have it. Instead, I decided to give the \"2 Minutes for Roughing\" a try.  As predicted, I didn't really like the taste of it and ended up not even finishing half of the drink.  Our wait staff noticed and was generous enough to waive the drink off the bill. Crispy Eggplants with Lemon Tahini dressing was our favourite dish.  This dish brought my friend and I to a whole new world as neither of us had tried deep fried eggplants before. The batter that they used to coat the eggplant was very light, such that it did not overpower the flavour of the eggplant.  The Lemon Tahini dressing also made the dish not as filling.  Harvest Kitchen offers different soups each day.  On our day of visit, I ordered the Curry Butternut Squash with Roasted Walnut soup, plainly because it sounded delicious LOL Anyhow, the soup was filled with butternut squash sweetness.  It had a hint of curry taste, which did not overpower other ingredients in the soup.  The taste of the walnut was very apparent as well.  The texture of the soup was creamy yet a little grainy, mainly from the butternut squash and walnuts.  I heard their Russet Fries is a \"must try\", thus I have ordered the Mushroom French Fry 'Salad' with Seared Flat iron Steak.  Without a doubt, their Russet Fries was one of the best that I've had.  I have no clue what their \"secret ingredient\" was, but it was something that once you had it, you will never forget about it.  Their salad consisted of Kale and couple other green veggies, topped with Parmesan cheese.  The salad was very refreshing, I can have it all the time if we could.  I was a little disappointed with the seared Flat Iron Steak.  I ordered it medium rare, yet it was very tough.  The taste of it was very ordinary as well.  Our wait staff recommended us the Daily Press - Braised Lamb with sauteed Red Onions, Spinach topped with Dijon Mustard with a side of Coleslaw.  I found the bread a little too dry and thick.  However, the lamb was delicious, the taste of the braised lamb was very apparent.  The red onions, spinach, and dijon mustard compliments the lamb very well, they bought out all the flavours of the lamb.  The Coleslaw was a good addition to this dish, as the sandwich was very filling.  It clears out your palate and get you ready for your next dish.  Harvest Kitchen was hands-down one of the best restaurants we've been to.  From the organic ingredients to the friendly wait staffs, everything came together to the perfection.  I definitely won't hesitate to revisit and enjoy another meal.

{"text":"I really like the food here. I have several allergies and intolerances and the menu options are quite accommodating (they are also willing to make substitutions). I have probably dined here 3 or so times. The service though, really needs work. I have now had 2 free meals after waiting over an hour for my food to come (both times with parties of 3 and under). I appreciate that they took ownership for poor customer service but complaining at restaurants gets tiring. If it weren't for such a good menu, I would skip over this one."}
{"text":". @HarvestHK_Diner Came for dinner for my birthday with a big group.  We got basically the entire downstairs while post people opted to sit upstairs in their beautiful patio and open dining area. Great vibe up there, but also spacious downstairs for us  So many great things to say. Farm fresh and omnivore friendly.  My husband is even more critical of restaurants than me, and he said he would come back.   Great friendly staff.  Awesome drinks including wine on tap for $1/oz and a beer and burger combo on Fridays. Also everyday 3 to 5 and 9 to 11 is half price drinks and snacks!  Great menu that caterer to everyone from the healthy to the gluttonous.   We had the mushroom fry salad which I recognized from the brunch menu (but without the egg). The Mediterranean dips were fun too and good to share.  Rarely will you have a bunch of meat eaters go for an all veggie dish but layered Kale, mushroom, beet, goat cheese, baked in a rice paper sounded unique and divine.  Hubby loved this burger too which came with a huge salad of his choice for $12.  Dessert had something for everyone. Vegan and gluten free and dairy free. I got to have a no cheese cheese cake that didn't make me feel query afterwards! Highly recommended. Tasted more like a mousse though. Very light but Tasted right.  Found out the chef was former of JOV, a small restaurant I remember with excellent tasting menus, back when It first open and was good.   We had a great time and the staff treated us excellent considering our big group and space requirements."}
{"text":"I cannot speak highly enough of Harvest Kitchen. From the food, the drinks, the super knowledgeable and friendly staff.. This place is a gem. Be patient when you go, because they're often super busy, but I promise you it's worth it. I've been as a normal restaurant guest and also with a private event, and I leave every time with a smile on my face. The SNA bowl with chicken is a personal fave but their specials are always exciting."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing drinks. I helped book our office holiday party here. 34 people or so. They spoiled us with so many vegetarian options, some spectacular meatless meatballs that are still being talked about two weeks later. This was a feast of plenty. Tempura eggplant that was light, not salty and piping hot. A curry that was Wan,  but I'm not into green or light curry so that's just me. The beef tenderloin was perfectly prepared, rare. But not seasoned as much as I would have liked since it's a sometimes bland meat. The mushroom side with sauce was beyond compare, gently acidic with quiet earthy undertones and a clean finish, it was an wonderful foil to the seared meat. There were many more dishes, and all decently presented. The ambiance is rustic, warm industrial, is lovely for dinner with friends or a weeknight date with the SO. Lovely attentive service with care! Highly recommended spot!"}
{"text":"I visited Harvest Kitchen on a Friday evening for a late dinner. The main floor dining area wasn't too busy but my friend and I wanted to sit on the patio, which had a bit of a wait. After maybe 10 or 15 minutes we were taken to our table on the upstairs back patio, which is unreal, it's like being in a friend's backyard. There are a lot of options on the menu for meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters alike. My friend and I decided to share the Mushroom French Fry \"Salad\" and both agreed that it was very good. I got the Southern North American Bowl and my friend got the Green Curry Bowl and we both enjoyed our mains. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I would love to go back to try their brunch one day."}
{"text":"The food was great here and the friendly waitress was funny and amiable.  We sat out on the upstairs patio and had good drinks and a very nice evening.  For an appetizer, we had the dukkah (Egyptian Dry Dip) which was so awesome I could have licked the bowl!  Although I was really tempted by the HK Meatless Meatballs, the weather seemed a little hot for that so I went with the Black & Green Kale (lightly sautéed kale with grilled butternut squash, crispy onions, Borgonzola cheese, raisins, toasted walnuts, pomegranate-agave dressing) to which I added tofu. It was delicious. One of my friends also had the Mushroom French Fry \"Salad,\" which she let me have a taste of, and it was wonderful.  Cool, nice vibe and friendly + unpretentious staff + great food = wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"\"We were tempted by their small street-level patio with it's bright flowered planters. The interior was a popular choice - trendy and bright but we wanted the fresh air and sunlight. We were glad that our determination was not challenged and we asked for their upstairs backyard patio, which was fortunately open.\"  \"A lot of care went into making every dish at Harvest Kitchen and we felt deeply rooted in the local. Our experience came together from the small details that matter - an intense chive flower, an attentive waitress, carefully seasoned and grilled asparagus, hand-cut coleslaw - once put together, one can feel a true touch of a great food experience. Highly recommended.\"  Just a few bites from our full experience."}
{"text":"food is always delicious and fresh.   great friendly atmosphere.  must try : The Cure juice. I normally hate juices, but their beet juice is a well balanced mix of sweet and tart. Plus it's healthy, so extra bonus!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The whole atmosphere is great, the patio is cozy, the staff are always so friendly and most importantly the food is always fantastic. I love the southern North American bowl, the green curry bowl, the seared tuna, and the breakfast burrito. I really haven't gotten something yet that I've disliked! My only complaint is that the water is always warm. Aside from that this place is a real gem."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having my birthday dinner party at Harvest Kitchen (there were 20 of us) and I'm so glad we chose to be there! The advice, atmosphere and food was all excellent! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular reviewer unless prompted, most of the time.  However, for my wife's birthday we ended up back at HK for my first time since a December staff party that was both fun and delicious. Our server Jason was a DELIGHT with a capital D - playful, enjoyable, and made my wife's evening!  To top off the impeccable service, even a mild dissatisfaction with an appetizer was handled effortlessly, and a replacement of soup came quickly to please her palate. We are regular diners, and don't usually chat a whole lot with service, but we had a real vibe going all night, and can't wait to return to HK for brunch or otherwise!  Appetizers for dinner - highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends for dinner. I have to say the place was okay in terms of decor, but the seating was cramped. I ordered the vegetarian lasagnas and I have to say I was not very impressed. The favors were okay, but the dish itself was not inspiring at all, I can probably make a better vegetarian lasagnas. The sauce was watery from the zucchini.  They should of used egg plant instead in my opinion. And for a lasagnas,  not enough layers.  The service was average. Our server he was nice but I have to say I was not impressed with the restaurant manager. I found her demeanor rude when she was answering my friend's question as to why we weren't allow to have the cake that we bought with us at the restaurant.  It's okay if the restaurant has a policy about not allowing people to have food that was not prepared by the restaurant (liability concern). But it was the way she addressed the question that I found kind of rude.  Would I come back to try their brunch menu? I might, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Although it's easter morning, my friend and I decided to go to Harvest Kitchen for a quick brunch before heading off to the library to study. When we got there, it was pretty full since they had just opened and everyone had just been seated - however they were still able to find a seat for us at the back. We ended up being seated in their small back area and it was almost as if the servers continually forgot about us. We waited almost an hour for our food and it was only when we asked them to check on our food was it finally ready. Reading the other reviews, I'm wondering if they had just left it on the counter to be picked up but we never got it since they forgot? The food was very mediocre and quickly asked for the bill. After waiting another 10-15 minutes for someone to bring the bill, I went up to someone at the counter and asked how the billing worked - wondering if we were supposed to pay at the register. She apologized and quickly sent someone over with the bill. The waitress handed me the machine and quickly ran off to help seat a family that had just walked in. I paid my bill and left a very small tip since the service was horrendous.   All in all: very mediocre food paired with horrible service that almost forgets that you were even there."}
{"text":"Came here for 1pm brunch on a saturday. Seems like a nice little restaurant with good service, nice vibe, and super packed! But almost too packed because by the time our order came, we had to leave for another appointment. It took a good half hour for our food to arrive and we ended up wrapping it to go.  I got the classic benny with spinach and home fries. When I opened the box, I was a little disappointed in the presentation -- it didn't look like it was worth $15 plus a 30min wait. Flavours were nice, the hollandaise sauce was buttery in a good way, but I'd say the potatoes were lukewarm and not hot.   My feelings about this place are mixed. I'm likely to find another brunch place next time."}
{"text":"Came to enjoy a meal on their beautiful rooftop patio. The way the big tree hangs over and has even been cut around in the patio fencing is pretty awesome and creates a wonderfully serene atmosphere.  Knowing they also cater to the tastes of my vegetarian eating friends, we made our way there for dinner recently.  Started with the Crispy Eggplant, which was a great sharing dish as it's cut length-wise into french fry like pieces and dipped into tempura batter. Would eat again. For a main, I went with the burger and fries. Surprisingly the one thing that stood out was the bun it was served on. Between myself eating the meat burger and someone ordering the veggie burger we both agreed that while our burgers were good, the bun was admittedly the best part which for a $16 burger isn't something to brag about. I'd probably skip the burger next time as one of our group got the Napolean Printemps which looked better and got better reviews, and the curry admittedly looks pretty solid too.  Drink menu was decent, nothing to write home about. All in all, despite a 4 star patio, the meal over all felt more similar to a 3 star experience especially when the cost of the bill came into the equation."}
{"text":"I really like this place and hope it thrives. The staff are authentically welcoming and generous. The food is excellent. And the coveted upstairs backyard patio is worth the wait. The menu skews healthy but not so far as to be pretentious. That's rare and worth celebrating. The only shortcoming on the busy Saturday night we had dinner there was the management (not the 'managers' but truly the 'management' of the place). Someone just didn't get the staffing and speed of service right that night. Maybe they were understaffed, maybe they haven't figured out how to flex kitchen and wait staff for the variability of demand between weekdays and weekends. I hope they find the right balance. To be fair, we experienced very prompt service on a prior visit for lunch on a Friday."}
{"text":"On a weekend brunch this place is busy, noisy, tightly-packed, family-friendly without being overly homely, and serves really good coffee and tea  -- pretty much everything you are hoping from a place like this.  The food?  The menu won't overwhelm you with choices and experienced brunchers (...brunchists?) won't find anything that'll make you push your chair back and exclaim, \"best ever!\" ........ partly because there's no space to push your chair back, and partly because the food never really tries to be anything more adventurous than your standard brunch fare.  Still very good food though (it's the only thing that keeps me from giving this place a lower rating)  Problems?  You might wait a long while for refills and your bill.... the service we received was friendly but it sure seems like they could use another person on the floor.  Don't be surprised if 2 hours goes by from being seated to paying.  And yes this place is vegetarian friendly but vegans will be hard-pressed to find something to eat."}
{"text":"We were there this afternoon on the beautiful back patio is the sunlight. It was maybe half full.. one waiter and later a bus person who did not seem to know what to do. Service was extremely slow, like over two hours in total. When I asked for a little bit more salad dressing the waiter bit my head off, complaining he was 'in the juice'. It was horribly rude and soured our meal. Awful!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely brunch on Sunday morning. The food was great and all the staff were attentive and friendly. I'm  definitely looking forward to visiting  again!"}
{"text":"A very sweet little place with friendly staff and a wide variety of choices. The spritzer was a tasty non alcoholic alternative to a cocktail and my burger was totally satisfying."}
{"text":"Interior design is nice and warm. If you sit near the wall, you can hang your coat/bag on the hook.   I ordered their grass fed beef burger with fries on the side. It tastes great. The coleslaw is very refreshing and not too much mayo in it."}
{"text":"After re-visiting this lovely place multiple times, I had to write an update: This place is a must try for casual fare. I have since ordered the mushroom fries w/steak and it is an outstanding & brilliant dish. Brunch is also delish, and their rooftop patio is a delight under the twinkle lights & tree canopy. Do not miss this spot :)"}
{"text":"What I love most about Harbord street is the fact that it's away from the always - busy Bloor street.  But what takes the cake is its handful of warm cozy and intimate restaurants that are along thus stretch of road.  My friend and I came across Harvest Kitchen and it seemed like a cute and inviting place. The ambiance is great, chilled out,  dimmed, lit candles, hardwood floor,  rustic decors and friendly staff gives positive character to Harvest Kitchen that's been opened for approximately one year.  Their menu has a great selection but unfortunately we were there for wine and dessert.  We both ordered a glass of red Aussie Shiraz and nibbled on some roasted soy beans on the house.  For desserts we opted for both their classic carrot cheesecake and cheeseless...yes CHEESELESS blueberry cheesecake.  Carrot cake was a blast, nice and light to compliment the wine 4/5.  However it was the cheeseless cheesecake that was enjoyable,  extremely light,  refreshing and yummy! Overall experience place is awesome and I will have to make a second trip to Harvest! Awesomeness! See you soon HK!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We had a few appetizers: the tempura pickles, kale salad and the soba salad. Main dish was the green curry. Every single thing I ate was delicious and had lots of veggies. The only complaint is that I wish it was closer. Please open a harvest kitchen in the east end!!! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday for a group of 8 people. The food came out completely scattered with 4 people receiving their food an hour and a half later and the other 4 about an hour and fifty minutes later. We repeatedly expressed our frustration with the staff. They gave us cookies to shut us up and then slapped on 18% gratuity for waiting nearly 2 hours for food. This restaurant has extremely poor service and the kitchen is ill-equipped. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want to have a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! And better food! The drink menu is exceptional and the atmosphere is welcoming :) keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen accommodated our unusually large party with some confusion, but everything worked out fine. The food was excellent and well priced. They made the burger properly, as in, not gray, and the Kilsch was flowing well. The atmosphere is very nice! Overall, I'd be happy to go back for reasonably priced, responsibly sourced, tasty food."}
{"text":"The food was generally good, the decor is homey and cozy, but be prepared to wait a long while for your food.   I had an inventive Benny on a bed of spinach, kale, French fries and mushrooms which really worked. My partner had a more traditional Benny with a side green salad which was wilted and less than crisp - she was disappointed.   The worst part was the 40 - 50 wait we had until our food came. And these dishes are not particularly complex. The wait staff were a bit slow to acknowledge us when we got there, and at no point did we get informed on how long the food might take - even setting our expectations that the kitchen was backed up would have helped.   We will likely not go again."}
{"text":"Two of us came here on a Sunday at noon, asked for a table, and were told that tables are turning over and that we would be seated shortly. 20 minutes later, we weren't seated yet, and again, were told that we should be seated within minutes. We were finally seated at 1:00pm - an hour later. Then, after we sat down and were ready to order, we were told by the waitress that the kitchen is backed up by an entire hour (so, food comes at 2:00pm).  I can't believe how poorly managed this place is, and I am appalled at the blatant disregard for people's time. The hostess (who is also the manager) could have easily told us about the backlog in the kitchen up front, and we probably would have gone somewhere else from the get-go. Their poor excuses when confronted about this added insult to injury. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and was greeted very enthusiastically (which I like because it's like me) and we got to pick the seats by the window.  Cute place with neat decor and very nice service.  The food was awesome, and even the prices substantially lower than your typical brunch place.  Got omelette of the day (filling and lovely) but the best part was the soup.  It was thick, not too creamy and tasted sweet but savoury at the same time. Sorry for the elaborate description, but it was actually really good.  Also got the grilled cheese (it's ten times better than your average) and it was extra cheesy with the cheddar.    The service was amazing, I forgot to get her name but she was very energetic and had a personality. Also very attentive which is a tippitytop priority for me.   Overall it was a great experience and I would come again (it's the soup)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past year. I came with a larger party once (reservation upstairs) and the other times for dinner with 1-2 friends on the patio. Love the treetop patio, food is affordable (1 glass of wine, entree, elixer, and dessert for $35), staff is friendly. This is my go to spot."}
{"text":"Very slow service when we went and the food was mediocre. Nothing really stood out to us. Liked the environment and staff."}
{"text":"This place was really great. The host was a really nice guy but our waitress seemed a little inexperienced. No big deal, I think she was just learning. Food took a while but it was delicious. Wonderful poached eggs. The PB and Banana smoothie was awesome. I'll be back the next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for some after work drinks and apps. Nice buzzing atmosphere with very friendly staff. The few options that we had were excellent, particularly the fried eggplant. Will return to try dinner selections!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's like a hidden oasis, and so true to life. Went here for brunch after a 10k run on a scorching summer day. We were seated right away (even though the place was fairly busy), our food came fairly quickly. Good portion sizes, food is delicious and organically sourced which I appreciate. I had the classic eggs benedict with peameal bacon.  There's a second floor patio in the back - gorgeous. Couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"So, I came here back during their opening week and fully expected them to be working some of the kinks out of their service/food. I had dinner on a Friday night with four others.  We arrived around 6:30 and had no problem getting a table immediately. I somehow doubt that this would be the case now, given that they've been open for a little while, so I'd give yourself a little time to get a table. Once seated things got off nicely.  Some of the points in the more critical reviews were observed by my group as well, especially in terms of the servers not quite knowing how to be attentive to tables properly. If this weren't a brand new place, I might have given them 3 stars instead of 4, but given the level of attention from the owners and manager, I think they'll work some of these flaws out in the coming months.  I will say, everyone in my group really enjoyed their meals. Also, the wine and beer on tap were great and a big hit at our table.  Toronto is in dire need of a place that does meat and vegetarian dishes equally well, and I'd say that Harvest Kitchen fits the bill nicely. We will be back again."}
{"text":"We came here for weekend brunch and I am definitely a fan.  I had the french toast and my hubby had the eggs benny.  So I have to say -- the french toast is awesome -- they bake it in a deep bowl with fruit and it puffs up and is more like a yummy bread pudding.  I am officially a FAN!  The eggs benny had a choice of spinach or bacon.  Hubby said it was great -- and by the plate that was quickly cleaned off -- well -- we'll be going back!  Parking is on the street. Ambiance is casual and friendly. A small patio and the restaurant isn't huge -- but I can see where it will be like on a weekend -- \"man, we just gotta go there -- I am so craving that french toast\"!!  They have all kinds of smoothies and natural options too. Love it, love it!"}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Every dish is inspiring"}
{"text":"Not only is the atmosphere/vibe great, but the staff are friendly and the burgers are incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening and was seated upstairs. After placing our order, it took almost an hour to get our food!! We had a party of 7 and can't anticipate that it would take so long to get all dishes prepared. To make it worst, my side salad had no dressing... I was eating plain, dry leaves. When I asked the server if I could have dressing for my salad, he said \"I can give you more dressing\". More dressing?! I didn't have any to begin with!! Which made my salad taste super bitter. Ugh.   Extremely slow service, decent food."}
{"text":"We went for a casual Friday night hang out, the food was good but not that memorable. Wine was reasonably priced. Service was good, but there were maybe some missed cues about when we were ready to order. Service was still attentive and friendly.  Good place if you're in the area, but I wouldn't make an effort to dine here."}
{"text":"Was originally a big fan of this place. Went 2 or 3 times and each time the food was fantastic (also there's a good number of veggie options & the service is really good). Unfortunately (after talking it up quite a bit) I took my bf there on a date, and the food was strangely disappointing. I've been back for drinks since then, as the atmosphere is nice and they have a great upstairs outdoor patio - but haven't quite got over the food 180."}
{"text":"Great food and the waitress who served us was really sweet."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews here and my love for the restaurant that used to occupy this space (Kensington Kitchen). Unfortunately, this place was a disappointment at best. The food was bland and uninspired (we had the chicken and veggie pot pies and the breakfast burrito), and the service was painfully slow. Specifically, the breakfast burrito needed more fresh ingredients and more color. It was all kind of glopped together in a grey/brown mess. The pot pies were fine, but not very flavorful. The fries were quite good, but I don't know how often we'd visit a place like this just to eat fries. There are much better options in the area (DT Bistro, Boulevard Cafe, THR, Harbord Room, etc.), so I wouldn't waste your time."}
{"text":"My work had our holiday shindig here so yes this review is long overdue. The food was great. I tried some things that were unfamiliar to me but nonetheless i really enjoyed. Which definitely includes the fried eggplant, meatless meatballs, and the flank steak. This was my first time having steak that wasn't well done (I know, I know). It ultimately is what converted me to not eating well done steak and being more of a rare person. The atmosphere was great, I thought the service was really good too considering it was an office party and I can imagine it's stressful for servers and not the best for tips. The drinks were strong and there were plenty of options. I also like that they're locally sourced ingredients. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Spectacular Brunch spot on Harbord just west of Spadina. My 2nd time there today, the owners do a great job of creating a warm welcoming space, great lighting, attentive staff that introduce themselves and provide great service even though it was almost at capacity.  The music is just loud enough to hear but not disruptive, a great crowd of what looked to be locals from the neighbourhood with families and also a wide variety of groups all seemingly happy to be there.  Our meal started with a well concocted Vodka caesar drink, and a cold glass of Stiegel served in the appropriate style glass.   The peanut soup was served in a porcelain cup, beautiful color, consistency and temperature, flavors were balanced. More Cilantro please!  We had the standard eggs bennie and the mushroom/kale ensemble.  Firstly all though both of these dishes have the same delicious organic and super yellowy yolks they radically take different directions after that, both very pleasing!   The standard with your choice of spinach, trout or back bacon is prepared beautifully.  A house made english muffin, perfectly cooked eggs, (we didn't ask for any particular way).  well conceived Hollandaise sauce just the right texture,(a hint of lemon I believe), with excellent hand cut fries, crispy but still able to absorb all the great flavors.  The mushroom French Fry benedict is even more spectacular, earthly mushrooms, delicately cooked, argula, kale and spinach come tender and full of flavor, I could not help but add a side of strip bacon to my order just to take it to the next level.    The owners simply get it here, I have had the burger on another location, the quality is top drawer, they have thought long and hard about the suppliers they have partnered with and it reflects in the food.  The owners here are hands on, one had an apron on and passed by me with a friendly smile, noticeably busy but not that he did not engage. I was also impressed that after our meal as i was paying the Maitre D and head seater came to ask how our meal was.    Next time we visit will be for dinner to check out the dinner and the late night dinner menu's.  Thank you Harvest Kitchen!"}
{"text":"After waited for 50mins they said they FORGOT the order!!!!!! Wth would never came back !! Don't come here because food takes forever and bad services!"}
{"text":"Last lunch meal in Toronto so I let J pick. She went with one that she frequents from time to time, Harvest Kitchen.   The inside is bright, cozy and laid back. We didn't have any trouble grabbing a table as it was a Wednesday so we sat by the window to watch all the people scurrying by in the 40km/hr winds. The chalkboard houses all their specials for the day.  - Coffee ($2.95) - coffee came out cold. Our server rectified the issue and brought out a new one when she inquired.   - Hand cut russet fries ($5.95) - the fries were great.  - HK burgers ($12.95) with kale salad ($5.50) - I had a bite of the burger and it was pretty good but I can't believe they charged $5.50 to add a kale salad! Not sure if that was a mistake (menu says $3.95) but I guess you pay a premium for kale.  - Daily sproutzzadilla ($12.95) - I went with the soup as my side, which was a mushroom almond puree with crispy onion and olive oil garnish. Wasn't a fan of the flavour combination. Pretty bland and boring. The sproutzzadilla was better with toasted grill marks and tender duck meat. The portion is small though.  Decent enough but it's pretty standard cafe fare."}
{"text":"Came here with friends and there was a party going on upstairs so it was busy (apparently it's popular for group things, and you can't make a reservation for parties less than 8).   The ambiance is very homey and cute, a real cozy feel. They are well stocked in inexpensive drinks and beers and can help you pick one if you're unsure about what you might like. Service is friendly and good.   I had the mushroom French fry salad (aka. Pouting with mushrooms and some green stuff). Overall, it was just okay. The fries could have been hotter but were tasty shoe string fries, and the mushrooms were very salty and a little shrivelled up and dry. Green stuff was scarce.   My friends had the green curry bowl and the North American bowl? And they said they were both good, the curry comes with very little rice and a lot of curry.   Will definitely be coming back for drinks and the coziness!!"}
{"text":"I would say I have slightly mixed feelings about this place. It seemed like it had so much potential. The staff was very friendly, the location was nice, the setup inside worked well. They have wine on tap which is always fun, although I might just have a slight hangover :)  The food on the menu looked amazing as described but the two dishes I tried I found to be just OK - maybe it was fluke and the rest is awesome which is what optimistic me wants to think but I can't give this place more than 3 because I thought the food was average.  The No-Meat Meatball Melt was pretty good but it comes on a relatively boring bun, I would say this could use a bit of umph to it.  The Cassoulet too I found to just be average. I wish I could say more but for a smallish bowl of beans, hard to find sausage and small piece of duck it just wasn't great. There are almost too many flavours in there you can't even appreciate the duck.  To conclude, I would return but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday, really hoping to sit on the tree-covered rooftop patio, but was sadly disappointed to hear that it's closed during weekdays (opens up at 4pm).  I'm not a fan of streetside patios, but we chose to sit there anyway and it was OK (ask the staff to open the awning if it's not already open). We had yummy ceasars and split two entrees: the kale salad and the veggie burger.  Both were delicious.  Next time I go back, I'll call ahead to ensure the rooftop is open."}
{"text":"Spacious brunch place with extremely friendly service and delicious food. Looking forward to coming back here in summer for the patio. Ordered classic benny with spinach and fries which was done very well. The wait time was not long for a sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Pricey... Closer to 2.5 $ signs,  but the food is undeniably excellent.   Had the burger with mushroom and lentil soup.  One of the healthiest,  non greasiest burgers I've had, with the perfect assortment of toppings-the pickles were a nice touch of surprise and really puts it over the edge. Soup was also surprisingly tasteful with more solid than liquid (which is a good thing)   Taking off a star because of rather hefty $20 price tag after tax and tips (no drink) and long wait (over half an hour)."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the Harvest Kitchen. It is a charming little spot. We visited however for its vegetarian dishes and having blown away by solid places like Lola's kitchen and Hibiscus, we found their food unexciting.  Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. We ordered the peanut soup, meatless meatball pasta, and vegetarian lasagna made without pasta. The soup, although extremely thick, was a winner. The pasta was okay, and the vegetarian lasagna, which was layered with zucchini, had a tad bit too much sauce in it.   It was a nice evening out, but it certainly was not memorable enough to make us want to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Their food comes from farm to table - that's really something!  Everything is delicious, they use lots of organic ingredients, the meat & seafood are ethically sourced.  Reasonable prices, large portions, great quality (try meatballs or burgers).  Plus there is lots of space - there are two patios and two floors!  I can only recommend H.K. - it's one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Hipster eatery that I was excited to try. I really enjoyed it and would like to come back. The appetizer below (which unfortunately I forget to get the name of!) was very delicious and the highlight of my meal. The french fry salad I would do without in the future.  They have an outdoor rooftop secluded area to eat and it's actually quite nice and intimate in a way. The staff were nice and had their own unique style which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Harvest Kitchen last weekend and were very impressed on all levels. The food was just delicious. I had the chickpea quinoa pasta which looked quite simple but popped with unexpected flavour. My husband had the meatless meatballs which were hearty and made for serious comfort food. We tried out Harvest Kitchen because, as a gluten-free vegetarian, I was excited to see that they have various option for me, but I'm confident that my carnivorous friends who don't know what gluten-free means would be very happy to eat there. The ambiance was great, the waitstaff were attentive, and we left resolved to come back (probably to try out their brunch)."}
{"text":"An excellent little breakfast/brunch place open all the way 'till 11pm. Their \"elixer\" drink menu is incredibly healthy but drool-worthy. I went with a healthy soup and salad combo today and I felt good afterwards. It was great. This place needs to get more attention so I've given it 5 stars. I will be back to order a real meal next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch because we were drawn in by the veggie options. The food was disappointing but the service and gorgeous rooftop patio made it an overall lovely experience.   Highlight if the visit was how wonderful all of the staff was about the twin five year old boys dining with us. They offered to bring fresh buns when the burger \"hat\" came slathered in mayo and were very sweet and patient taking their orders.   The food was yummy and i was glad for the variety of options on the menu but nothing was super memorable. I do want to come back to try their brunch which i've heard great things about!"}
{"text":"Food and breakfast drinks AMAZING. Had French fry salad which was bomb. Recommend side of pemeal bacon. Caesars had extreme beans as garnish. Best thing ever. Daily soup- great starter. Waiters dressed so we'll all friendly. Amazing roof top patio. Service a little slow we think because it was first patio day of the season, this is a factor that should be overlooked. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I equate the offerings here closer to Lola's Kitchen near Church and Bloor.  I find this place though holds a higher quality in relation to it though. That's not to say Lola's has poorer quality food, but the food is better here.  I had the American Rice Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. I also had the Roasted Beets with Walnut honey. I'd recommend all of it and I would recommend you test this place out if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm Harvest Kitchen was delicious. I had the eggs benedict with a salad (the lettuce leaves I used to wipe that hollandaise sauce clean) and a bottomless coffee. The place was busy and the service was great. My friends had the breakfast burrito, a breakfast bowl with brie, and hash browns. Everyone enjoyed their meals. They also have a program where you can farm in exchange for I think a meal. It is a cute little spot and I believe there is an upstairs too!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here today, my girlfriend had the vegan chilli and I had the shrimp combo with fresh vegetables and peanut soup. It was all fresh, organic, and locally farmed and the food wasn't bad.  4 out of 5 stars, there was nothing special and no Wow factor. Could use a bit more flavour. Would come back for their rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Really this is comfort food. It's not mind blowing, but it does make you feel like it's well worth it. The service is excellent. The drinks are inspired. The food is great (mushroom fries salad ??? who would have thought). The patio upstairs is magical."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and half to get dinner. In our group all dinners came at different times over a 40 minute spread. Not impressed"}
{"text":"the service is amazing. the selection of drinks is good and they are well made.  the food is decent but takes a while to come.   i don't mind the wait though. like others have said, the patio is wonderful. in my lifetime, harvest kitchen is the third iteration of this space/buidling and i still keep coming back for the patio. it's one of the best in toronto (the only other one i like more is rectory café on ward's island)."}
{"text":"I started coming here out of revenge, to appease my rage against the neighbouring restaurant Rasa (stupid name), who bought up one of the best patios in the entire city when the lovely little family-owned Lebanese restaurant Momo's went out of business. They promptly ripped out the beautiful grapevine that bathed the patio in a gorgeous dappled shade, painted the building an ugly grey colour, and - the worst - got rid of lunch service. Now, what WAS a gorgeous, beautiful little lunch spot is an ugly, bare, concrete, overpriced hipster joint, and all the families, faculty and staff from U of T are left with one less place to have lunch in the good-eating desert that is the U of T campus. Say hello to the hipsterification of Harbord. Ugh. DEPRESSING.   However: there is a massive silver lining, in that this has forced me to discover Harvest Kitchen. I never came here when it was Tati Bistro because it always seemed a little too fancy for a workday lunch. When Momo's closed, I was forced to look elsewhere, so I gave what had become Harvest Kitchen a try. Wow - I couldn't BELIEVE it. All this time, there was a patio almost as nice as Momo's right next door, but hidden up in the treetops! (Now, of course, given Rasa's \"renovations\", it is an infinitely better patio.) It's seriously gorgeous up there: relaxed, shady, stylish, comfortable, and there's even Wifi!! They have great coffee, beer specials in the afternoons, and the food is pretty darn good. There are lots of options - plenty of healthy vegan type stuff for those on a health kick, but also burgers and meat aplenty if you're in the mood for that. You can tell the food is made with care and consideration. Most of the stuff they use is organic/local, but the prices are really reasonable. The service is great - they always have (more than?) enough staff on, and they staff are unfailingly attentive and friendly. I couldn't ask for more, really. It has become my go-to lunch spot when I'm on campus, and I would love to come for dinner one evening when the gorgeous tree-covered deck is lit up. What are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"I wasn't gonna splurge on a dairy product, but boy did I ever want to... there was confetti on the floor as I walked in.. maybe signs of a looming celebration?? which i find strange because i see no reason to celebrate. the food here wreaks of mediocrity with accents of strong parsley. i ordered the soup du'jour but what i received the soup du'yesterday. it tasted older than Kipling station. i want to frequent this establishment because they always play metro station b-sides but the appalling flavour combinations keep me and my credit card at bay. now run and tell that!"}
{"text":"A group of 30 and myself went to Harvest Kitchen today to celebrate my friend's birthday. We reserved the upstairs room, which had a nice back patio attached. The atmosphere of the space was very comforting and the staff were friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and tasted great. They managed the group with ease. I would definitely recommend this spot for a birthday brunch."}
{"text":"Treetop patio - TREETOP PATIO!!!  This place is such a gem, and quickly has become my go to for work birthday lunches.   Their menu is extensive but not overwhelming, and includes lots of healthy options, plus some delicious not so healthy ones (they have great fries!). They are also very vegetarian (and I believe vegan) friendly.   The real gems on the menu can be found under sandwiches - their delicious chicken/avocado sandwich, but even more so their fantastic steak sandwich, which isn't overwhelmingly steak-y; it's just the right amount! Sandwiches come with a choice of side, (soup/salad/fries), as well as this delicious house slaw they serve, which is vinegar-y and wonderful.   Besides sandwiches I've also tried their breakfast burrito, which was delicious and filling.  The one thing I would say to avoid are the elixirs - they're kind of pricy, and in my experience.... kind of gross. Definitely stick with a pop!  My favorite thing about this spot is their back patio (aka treetop patio) which is nestled amongst the trees, and even built around them in some areas. It's such a quiet and quaint spot in the middle of the city.   On another note, I don't know if they do private events, but I think they would be fantastic for a small wedding!"}
{"text":"I went to harvest kitchen today. The food was amazing and the ambiance was awesome. We sat outside on the patio, with the amazing summer of Toronto in the background. I loved how there were all kinds of lightbulbs, lighting up the entire space in so many interesting ways. The service was very courteous and everything ordered was on point. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I lived in Portland for three years and am a Vancouverite at heart. So when I stepped into Harvest Kitchen on a mid-December's day, I felt right at home! As other reviewers have mentioned it is quite cozy and positioned well in the middle of the Harbourd Village.   That being said, I was caught! I was caught taking a picture and putting it up on Yelp. I was probed - \"is this how you found us?\" Reluctantly I muttered, \"Yes.\" I was somewhat discouraged by this because I realized that I was not going to get an authentic picture of the restaurant. Hence my fellow yelpers, I have to warn you to read my review cautiously.  The majority of the reviews in Yelp had made negative comments with respect to how long it took the food to reach the table after ordering. Mine took 16 minutes! This was substantially faster than others have experienced. Again, this was after our waitress found out I was a Yelper. I had ordered the chicken sandwich with corn chowder. I was tempted to get the sandwich because of the bacon mayo in it. The sandwich was light and delectable. My original plan was to get the african peanut soup to accompany my sandwich, but I was coerced into trying the chowder and was pleasantly surprised. My palate was clapping.   My wife on the other hand, was not a happy camper. She tried their signature dish - the mushroom, french fry salad. To put it lightly - it tasted like an oily mess. The french fries were soggy, the truffle drenched with oil and the greens lacking. We were disillusioned by this and put off by the restaurant. To end our meal, the bill took longer than the food to arrive.  As a Yelper, I took my walk of shame out of the restaurant, pondering how I can be more ninja next time. I really wanted to give this restaurant a solid review in light of the familiar atmosphere, kind service and decent meal. However, their signature dish was ho-hum."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our brunch did not go as planned.   We showed up at 12:45 to a relatively full house and we sat by the bar in order to get out of the way for the people who wanted the tables. We were greeted by a very pleasant person who said he was going to bring us coffees and water. Well just the coffees made it.   In short form, we ordered two standard meals (bacon and eggs and spinach eggs Benny) and after 40 minutes we asked for an update our meals. Gentleman came back and said they had a printer malfunction and that there would still be a wait. We said we'd like to cancel our order and he was nice enough to cover the coffee.   This was a very unorganized place with people running around and with no one with food on their tables around us. Another lady came from upstairs with a less friendly tone inquiring about the food as well.   After reviewing the Yelp reviews, it seems this is a constant problem this place can't seem to figure out. Hopefully they can turn it around soon otherwise this harvest is gonna dry up."}
{"text":"Burger overcooked. Bolognese tasted like it had been made 3 days ago. With 4 stars I expected a bit more! Atmosphere nice, food not so much. Try Rasa next door."}
{"text":"Went to Harvest Kitchen for brunch. The wait staff were attentive and helpful with our needs. It was busy and bustling but the staff were patient and friendly. The food was delicious--I especially liked the flat-iron steak side with the breakfast food. I love that it is somewhere that can accommodate vegetarians and non-vegetarians in a respectful and mindful manner. The decor is very interesting and welcoming. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my family when they first opened.  The food: exquisite! I ate every bite of my eggs Benny, perfectly cooked in every way. I even loved the cole slaw and I am NOT a coke slaw person. My companions both had the French fry mushroom Benny and none of us could stop raving about the deliciousness.   However - on our second visit things were not as good. We all ordered the same thing except this time it was mediocre. The English muffins (made in house and previously so delicious) were dry and tasteless. My companions had the mushroom fries again and were also sincerely disappointed. I complained to our server about the quality and was simply offered an explanation as to why the English muffins were bad and no other compensation was offered.   I'd been willing to try again and really hope it was just an off day but we haven't been back after that experience. I don't want to take a gamble on food at that price."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had the mushroom french fry salad served with poached eggs on top which sounds disgusting but is phenomenal. I had regular eggs benny, the bottom was a little soggy - but good none the less. I found it slightly expensive and it became very loud upstairs once it was full. This place gets pretty busy!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out Harvest Kitchen on Harbord Street. The place opened in the fall taking over the former space occupied by Tati. The place is decorated in a rich red with a marble bar that runs along one side of the restaurant. There are a selection of tables for two and four laid out on the main floor. Along the back wall is a chalkboard featuring beer and wine selections and desserts. The menu which is vegetarian friendly has a selection of dishes that fills a whole that was left by the closure of MoMo's last year. There were enough interesting options to keep us returning for a while. The prices and portions are pitched to a clientele similar to that of Harbord House and not the more expensive fine dining of the surrounding restaurants. I opted for the meatless meatball sandwich and a cup of the African peanut soup, while my friend had the spaghetti bolognase. The meatless meatball sandwich was delicious, featuring a really good sauce and the soup, rich and hearty. Everything arrived warm and was served by a friendly staff. My only quibble was with the music which was rock music played a little loud for comfortable dining. Beside that it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Solid high quality food. Went with mom, mother in law and husband for brunch. Very impressed with service & quality.   Best patio ever. Make sure to go to upstairs patio.  Pancakes were fabulous.  Need better tea selection. Mom was sad she couldn't get orange pekoe (or just tea!) And ended up going to a convenience store to  grab some.   Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Their individual cookie platter is delicious..with 3 different varieties of homemade gluten free ones - big cookies and doesn't feel too guilty eating them!"}
