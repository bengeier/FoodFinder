{"text":"This is my first review in yelp, but sorry I have to tell the truth. The worst ChongQing xiao mian that I've ever had in my life. This shouldn't be called ChongQing xiao mian. The noddle is not fresh, the portion is small, the soup is sort made of instant type \"misco\" thing... and the taste, oh man I think it has no taste at all except the spicy.. i can't find a word to describe  the experience I had."}
{"text":"Overall I'm happy with this restaurant, it serves chongqing style noodle.  Soup base is good and can be customized for spiciness.  I cannot tell if it's authentic because I've never been to chongqing, overall I felt it's pretty close because I've eaten chongqing food many times.

The beef noodle soup needs some improvement, the beef is not tender enough which makes it hard to chew and swallow.  The customer beside us was telling us the same but we decided to try it anyways.

The other complaint that I have is that we added extra meat for $5 and the amount of meat came out to the same amount as a regular noodle.  After notifying the waiter, he tried to explained it's about right but eventually we asked him to add more meat.  They need to be more generous when customer are paying for extra meat.

The other plus about this restaurant is extra noodles are free.  Restaurant is pretty clean and spacious so far.  Lots of parking in the plaza.

Service is good, waiter was very patient in explaining the menu."}
{"text":"My GF really wanted to try this place, as it had Chongqing style of noodles. we ordered two sets of noodles, an appetizer and a desert.; The appetizer was simply not good, the flavour tasted weird and not fresh. the desert it had good syrup but the pudding itself was again weird. and this is not becuase we've never tried this regions food, its becuase it just wasn't right. Now onto the noodles the main reason this place exist. The noodles themselves were nothing spectacular. the portions of noodles were too little for the price they were selling it at. and the flavors were not that great. it seemed to be missing some spices in terms of the soup. I find overall the flavours were okay at best, but the price for each item was definitely not worth it, and some dishes simply had mistakes all over them. 

i will not try this place again, and won't recommend to others to try either. its too bad because it has potential. it just needs some improvements."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch. We were seated right away. 
The menu is small 2 dozen items to choose from mostly noodles. You can customize the spiciness level of the broth and toppings on the noodles, extra noodles at no cost.
I have never had Chongqing noodles before so didn't know what to expect. I order the marinated pork noodle (spicy) the broth was ok somewhat spicy for me, the noodles was chewy and the pork was good. 
My friend got the sweet and sour beef noodle soup less spicy. There a generous amount of beef in there. It tasted pretty good, the noodles are chewy. The peanuts are pretty good.
The food came out pretty close to what the picture look like from the menu.

Overall it was ok. My friend liked it."}

Hei Xiao Mian just opens at Midland and McNicoll right next to Jim Chai Kee. 

The interior decor is nice and trendy. Clean as it is still new. 

Menu is simple with a choice of noodle or rice bowls. You can pick how spicy it is (or non spicy at all) plus the chewiness of noodle (soft or hard). And the best thing is Free additional noodles if you are a bigger eater.

Beef Sirloin Noodle Extra Numb ($10.95) 
The beef is of good quality and tender!! The noodles has a good bite. And yes it was spicy....... 

Since most of the spiciness is by adding chili oil so it can be quite oily. (Pro Tip: Don't play with your phone while eating!!)

During lunch hour, it took quite awhile for the food to be ready (+15 minute), I hope you have a long lunch break.
