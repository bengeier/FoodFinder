{"text":"I work as a receptionist for a law firm downtown and will sometimes get last minute catering demands. Like, it's 4:30 pm and I need breakfast for tomorrow last minute. Green Bean has always been fantastic for me, even on incredibly short notice.  We typically order for 8-15 people so I can't vouch for larger orders but, in my opinion, they're an excellent contact to have on hand."}
{"text":"Overpriced & terrible service.  I gave the first time a pass since this place was new, but it continues to disappoint. Food IS good but prices are quite high. Combined with the awful service from the middle aged woman who seemed quite attentive to patrons who looked like big tippers but had to be flagged down repeatedly for basic service (water, utensils after we waited 15min for each) I was livid.   The food is good, but if you read this Green Bean, please improve the service. I may not wear a suit ALL the time but I work downtown too (nearby even!!) and your server snubbing patrons like me is a huge fail."}
{"text":"Definitely a good little spot! I was visiting my dad at the courthouse and went there for lunch. We sat on the patio because it was a nice day! The service was decent but not extraordinary. We were waiting for quite a while before we actually got served, and it wasn't super busy. Annoying, but not a huge deal!  I ordered the beef dip and it was great! The meat cuts were pretty lean which was nice and the dip was perfect. I had Caesar salad on the side and it was good!  It's the location I think that is the best part though. Such a great and beautiful part of downtown to people watch. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The service was not very good and the place didn't even have any tables (empty).  The food was delicious although the one egg was very soft and the other was hard, all within the same meal and not to order (medium).  The prices were reasonable!   I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. The Cajun chicken sandwich was amazing! The veggies and rice needed no additional spices. Everything was cooked perfectly and came out hot. The wait staff were friendly and courteous.   Need some new food for your Instagram? The food presentation here is phenomenal!  Maybe bring a friend who has a forklift, because the portions are massive."}
{"text":"Met a customer here this morning.  What a delightful find.  The service was very good, the restaurant was clean and inviting.     I had the oatmeal, with fruit and yogurt.  It was very good, but be careful the pears are saut√©ed in brown sugar.  To sweet for me, so i picked them out.    Would love to come back and try other items.     Great place"}
