{"text":"Noisy and tacky atmosphere. Boring food, awful  rice, very sloppy rolls, food presentation on a par with a fast food chain. For a good classy and honest fair, stick with Mikado on Laurier, and do not listen to the naysayers."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday and the restaurant wasn't all that busy considering our reservations were for 9pm.  We expected to be seated right away but we waited for half an hour.  
Food was excellent but the service was less to be desired. We had to find someone to fill our water glasses, chase someone down for more soy sauce and no one came to check on us until it was time for the bills. 
Food was great, service not so great....."}
{"text":"Sushi is my best freind. And this place is my home. If you ate here you knoe whatvim talking about ..everything is delicious from the sushi to the cooked food to the wine.. the place is so exciting both location are great I like the one in ddo but its so far!"}
{"text":"I came here for supper and ate on their Terrasse and it had a lovely atmosphere. Not too loud and a nice relaxed setting in Outremont. 

The wait staff was friendly and attentive with their service. I got the sushi à la carte menu for $35. It was a good bang for your buck. It included a miso soup, a garden salad, shrimp and vegetable tempura, 1 maki roll, 10 pieces of nigiri, dessert, and tea. Everything was very simple and it tasted good, my only reservation is that I didn't like the maki roll. It was a roll that had cooked tuna on the inside and I didn't like the taste. Unfortunately, I was only given one maki and I would've preferred a variety. The dessert was simple and consisted of vanilla ice cream and a small piece of banana cake."}
{"text":"By not giving Maiko a whole bunch of stars i feel like im desecrating holy Montreal ground. I had heard from a number of people that Maiko is THE place for Japense but it left me disappointed. 

Honestly i dont care overly much about service, ambiance or price (All of which Maiko has in spades) - just let me taste excellent food. When it comes to Japanese Sashimi is the yard stick for quality and in this case it was dry and slightly rubbery. I am seriously hoping I was just unlucky but i've had better for a lot less even in quality Japanese staved Montreal (eg. Azuma nearby on St-Laurent)

On the plus side the Miso was awesome, the Rolls quite special and desert was definitely of 4 star quality.

Until my next visit: a slightly sad face for Maiko"}
{"text":"Great food, very attentive service. I went there with a friend on saturday evening and the place was packed, but we got a place although we didn´t make a reservation. 
The sushi was fantastic and the mini lava chocolate cake a definite must-have as a dessert! 
I´ll definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is right down my street, but I went because EVERYONE tells me it is the BEST place in Montreal.  This comes with the disclaimer that although there are alot of sushi joints -- but not alot of good ones.  This is my second sushi place in Montreal, and it was really good.  The sashimi was excellent -- yellow tail, salmon, tuna -- the rolls are good and BIG and very creative.  The unagi and octopus were also good.  We had a few appetizers and the scallop one was heavenly.  

It wasn't cheap, but worth it. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"All the dishes are so well presented. I am a fan of Maiko Sushi the fish is fresh,the service is nice. The private room is great for parties of group gatherings. Great place. Great sushi"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I had to write about Maiko...I must say that I thought I was going for sushis and ended up getting sushis with barely any fish in them and waaaay too much rice! 
I spent 70$ for me only just to eat rice! 
Definitely overpriced and boring Outremont crowd...I do not recommend this place.
Try tri-express on Laurier East instead!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but food makes up for it. One of the best sushi places in Montreal. Their rolls are always fresh and beautifully presented. The decor and ambiance of the place is also really nice. Perfect place for a quiet date with great food. For those who aren't sushi lovers they also offer different things from fish to chicken and much more. Great place."}
{"text":"Quel bon restaurant! Super service attentionné, sashimis remarquables (jardin de Maïko), suivi d'un maki L'enfer et d'un 9-1-1, avec comme grande finale le Délice de Maïko, arrosé de saké bien frais.
Vraiment excellent!"}
{"text":"I went there last night and I definitely enjoyed the experience. We were a party of 6 and ordered a BUNCH of different types of food and shared (as I like to do, whenever I go to new sushi restaurant).  Overall, the food was very good. 

The presentation was very nice. I don't know of you watch Hannibal but the presentation reminded me of that... minus the fact that Hanninal is a Cannibal [google \"Hannibal food porn\"].

The only negative for me was the sake selection. It wasn't diverse enough for my taste."}
{"text":"I haven't been back in a year (since 2010), but Maiko remains my favourite sushi restaurant. Pricey yes, but worth it.

The plates are beautiful, and the service is very nice.

I know it isn't everyone's cup of tea, and I like a good all you can eat buffet as well, but this is a place you go on a special date, or with great friends for a nice time out."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with Maiko sushi. Sushi is my absolute favourite type of food. The ambiance is classy and romantic for a couple. The sushi is very delicious and filling. I love the how the rolls have very authentic tastes and had allowed me to appreciate pieces of fruit in my sushi. The service is professional and the chefs are very kind as well"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 
It's great for big groups or small. I recently celebrated a party there and it was an amazing experience. 
I would definitely recommend, just hard to find parking."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Montreal if not ANYWHERE.
Try the :
Soleil de Maiko
Enfer
Cornet Paradis 
Pesto sushi (trust me it is awesome!)
...but everything is good 

Great drink selection too!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Maiko especially their specialty rolls which they hit out of the park every time. The only downside would be the atmosphere; the place is a little dark and quite noisy and packed- however this speaks to the quality of food which is absolutely fantastic. Sushi is always fresh and the plates are always artistically presented, Service is great too; really friendly and attentive wait staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"No seriously. This is not sushi, this is some sort of Montreal fusion sushi-lookalike."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Fresh, really good sushi.  Not cheap but high quality fish.
Lovely presentation and attentive service.
Prices between $20 to $30 per person without wine."}
{"text":"Food was artistic and tasty. However, crowded seating, cold room temperature and arrogant reception have stopped me from going back again."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi place I've eaten at! I went on the recommendation of the hotel staff where I was staying. The service was nice, especially the warm cloth brought over by the waiter to wash my hands and face just prior to having dinner. The presentation was excellent too but the sushi was thinly sliced and lacked the phenomenal taste that I have become accustomed to. I will not be back to this establishment during my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Small amount of fish in the Maki rolls. Nice atmosphere but not good value for the sushi."}
{"text":"It's not cheap but it's the best sushi in Montreal bar none. Now you might be saying that Montreal isn't exactly known for its sushi and you'd be right with that qualification. I used to think Sho-Dan was the best but I think it's gone down in quality over the years while Maiko is consistently good (and slightly cheaper than Sho-Dan). The interior is tastefully decorated and the sushi platters are beautifully arranged and decorated. My only gripe is that service can occasionally be excessively slow but I guess that makes sense considering how crowded it always is."}
{"text":"I really like this place although it is a sushi place and I am not actually a fan of sushi there are a lot of awesome dishes !!!! The teriyaki sirloin comes out sizzling hot with a decent amour of vegetables. My other favourite is the katsu chicken because I just love the sauce that comes with it. For those who say it's over priced I do not agree, you do get with almost every meal a miso soup and a salad which I have to say is pretty good. I have been here around 7 times, it's one of the very few places my colleagues could actually all agree I pretty good so that counts for something. I found it a under rated so gave it 5 stars :-))))"}
{"text":"One of the most decent sushi places in Montreal. The quality of food is good (love coraille de thon and maiko salad), ambiance is OK (terrace is lovely). Service is pretty good.  Prices OK."}
{"text":"Maiko Sushi is a unique, fusion-inspired Japanese restaurant. The ambience is warm and welcoming, and the decor is simple and sophisticated. This is very different from all the Japanese restaurants I've been to. While they have fresh sashimi, my local friend ordered the other special dishes for me to try instead. They also have a great selection of sake from their house sake to the high end ones like Black and Gold.

Everything I had was so good - the standout were the oysters and the avocodo salas!"}
{"text":"The decor is very simple, and basic but very clean. With the menu you get an exhaustive list of Sushis Sashimis, makis and handrolls. There is a variety of japenese fish on top of  the standard choices you can find in other sushi places. If you want to try new flavors you are at the right place. I started with a sunomo salad,  followed by a dozen sushi,  the food is tasty and the experience is good. Overall if you want to experience new flavors and ready to pay more than the usual sushi place then try Maiko."}
{"text":"Maiko has changed my attitude towards sushi rolls. Before eating at Maiko's, I never liked ordering sushi rolls. They offer such unique flavours and types of rolls that are just delicious. That being said, I am still more of a sashimi person and like one other writer mentioned, I'm disappointed in the fact they do not have toro. I've tried ordering sashimi once and have to admit that I've had better.  I will stick to the rolls :).  I am thinking of trying their other one located in West Island since that is closer to home."}
{"text":"Recommend lunch, very reasonably priced for wonderful food.  Beautiful split dining room (fantastic aquarium) and lots of window seating.

Gorgeous plating for both hot & cold food.  Dishes are made special with unconventional ingredients.  Highlights include interesting array of vegetables served with fish entree, shiso/perilla leaves incorporated in the maki and the dessert of the day (mini avocado cake.)

Servers can get a bit overwhelmed but generally free of attitude.

There is a Premiere Moisson nearby (just West on Bernard) if you are looking for yummy baked goods.

Based on 1 dinner and 4 lunch visits."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere
Nice restaurant
But the food is not very good(( 
I tried some specials from the menu, it was't bad. However it could be better for sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont excellents... mais les spécialités sont vraiment incroyables. Le service et l'atmosphère sont parfaits!"}
{"text":"After trying Maiko, I hardly want to go to an \"All you can eat\" sushi joint! This restaurant serves yummy sushi and love the presentation and environment. A nice place to go to on a date or a special occasion. Can be hard to find parking around the area, but I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was in montreal recently for work and this place was right next door to my hotel.  A bit on the pricey side, so if i didn't have a per diem i'm not sure i'd eat here.  The food however was great.  I tried several of the specialty rolls and all were delicious.  I liked the place so much i ate there twice.  (i try to eat at as many different places as possible when i'm traveling, so i rarely eat at the same place twice.)"}
{"text":"Yeah, I don't recommend this place. For such a high end sushi place that should be importing their fish (I mean that's why I'm paying so much for it, right?), how can you not have toro or some good fatty salmon. I don't get it. I think this place is concentrating on being fusion. If so, let's take the \"sushi\" out of the name. I have to agree with the others here, the fish is what you grade when a Japanese place calls themselves a sushi place.

As for what we had...

Agadashi Tofu, good, can't complain. Beef Sashimi, skimpy, but wrap less veggies, shake off the sauce if you want to taste the beef more. Now comes the sushi. Yellowtail was good, best stuff there. Tuna, not bad, clean fresh, nice rich color. Salmon was about the same, not the highest quality I've had though. Uni was a stinker. Don't mask old pieces of uni with newer. Some people can tell the difference. Not cool. As for the rolls. I'm not the biggest fan, but we ordered one. Forgot the name, but it was cooked, deep fried actually and inside was salmon. it was good in flavor.

Overall, I won't be coming back when I revisit Montreal. I'll be hitting other places so maybe I in the end I'll say what others are saying \"It's the best sushi in Montreal.\" I'm hoping not. Montreal has some good eats."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times the sushi has been great! We've tried about 15 different rolls and have yet to be disappointed.  The service is really attentive and brings the food out fast."}
