{"text":"The restaurant is clean and accommodating for large groups of people. Servers are pretty Korean, as in they are more comfortable speaking Korean. Regardless, everything on the menu has an english translation. 

They offer a large variety of Korean food. Mainly hot soups, and traditional favorites like bibimbap and ddukbokki. 

Pretty good side dishes~ 
I recommend the mackerel dish. 
Bulgogi jungol is very delicious. So is the soondae guk. 
Rice is purple and yummy.
More than good enough for the price!

Come with someone who knows Korean so you can flag the waitresses down for refills."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was very impressed. Service was great and fast. I ate the Took Baeki Bulgoki and it was very good.Side dishes were plentiful. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Dont even bother to try. I have tried many korean places but havent seen worse service and food than this place. not recommended."}
{"text":"It's awesome for those who love meat and combos here are cost-efficient! Besides it opens for all day !"}
{"text":"Two very trusted sources recommended this place to me and yes, the food (at least what I've tried) is every bit as delicious as they said it would be which aligns with what other people here seems to be saying as well.  

HOWEVER, the few concerns here regarding tips is VERY valid and is an unfortunate blight for an otherwise excellent eating establishment.  I am a firm believer in leaving tips that are commensurate with the level of service and I will admit that I was reasonably generous here.  The part that caught my attention was when I went to grab the change (cunningly provided in coins only) and it looked like I was about to only leave a loonie behind as a tip (I hadn't even grabbed all the coins yet), not one but TWO of the waitresses looking on let out a small yelp in the form of a \"NO\" until they realized that wasn't my intention and they caught themselves.  It was funny perhaps but also very telling, as if revenues from tips are a part of their business model.  For a food service based business (I have also been a manager in the food service industry) this type of attitude is unacceptable.  One's Tip or Gratuity should not be expected and any amount should be accepted with at least some humility as a measure of how well you've performed your duties.  Of course there are clients out there that cannot be pleased no matter how hard you try, do not believe in tipping, or are otherwise cheap - but there will always be people like that and as this is part of the business and industry, the SERVICE industry, and tips again shouldn't be a hard expectation.  

I'm conflicted as to whether I want to return.  I love good food at decent prices and this place surely fits the bill ... but when it comes time to pay the bill, I'm not sure I want to deal with the lasting impression of the last impression made by the servers with respect to tipping."}
{"text":"The food is fine, the price is fine, the service is what it is (straight forward, not rude not nice, just order). But check the food inspection on the wall folks \"conditional\"! You want to eat at a place that's not sanitary? I don't."}
{"text":"Waited in line for over 1 hour and they do not take reservations on busy days but somehow this gentleman who is the owners son happens to bring  5  friends in And bypass a long lineup . I am still in line waiting. !!! Jan 15 8:17 pm ... Poor service and no respect for loyalty of customers !! Last time ! Only staying cause I waited an hour"}
{"text":"Food was quite good.  We ordered Korean bbq steak and it was very tender and tasty.  However, this restaurant desperately needed a ventilation system.  I deeply regretted wearing my cashmere coat tonight.  I will take it to dry clean."}
{"text":"Recently opened, bright and freshly renovated dining area, experienced kitchen, wait, and management. What's not to like? Food is delicious, healthy and consistent. The owners of this restaurant were managers of the popular Im Ga Ne down the street. Open 24hrs, reasonable prices. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre compared to other places in the area. Since this place is open 24/7, it probably explains why the food isn't as fresh. My tabletop cooking meat came out frozen with some pieces stuck together. The green peppers looked dried out as though it's been cut and sat outside for a long time. However, it's cheap and the prices on the menu includes tax. On the other hand, their service is horrible and I chose to reflect that in the tip. I am not a difficult customer. I will gladly leave a tip if you seat me, and take my order correctly. Somehow, the waitress was able to mess that up. I paid at the register and the cashier had the audacity to come up to me before I left to ask.. \"Tip?\" 

This place is recommended to those who want a cheap late night meal where they won't mind the servers telling them how much to tip."}
{"text":"Worst korean food (maybe overall worst experience) experience. Ordered monk fish, stewed duck and bi bimbab for 3 of us. Non of us was able to eat our food. It tasted weird. Also when we wanted to pay we wanted to leave only 2 dollars tip since service and food quality was horrible. They asked for more tips. Never seen a restaurant like this in toronto. Absolutely not recommended."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend yesterday for dinner. The place is really nice and clean but seems constantly queuing up. We had our seat at the traditional Korean table where you have to curl your legs to seat. It is an interesting dining experience but a little bit uncomfortable. We ordered a beef BBQ combo and a seafood pancake. The seafood pancake is soooo good! The pancake was made with lots of seafood, green onion and eggs and the pancake sauce is so yummy. The Beef BBQ came with a spicy tofu soup and two bowl of rice. The beef is very fresh and the portion is enough for two ppl. Btw, Their beef intestine BBQ looks so yummy as well as the spicy seafood stew. I will definitely come back and try soon!! 

And the best part is this restaurant is just beside the Coco tea shop!! So you can takeout some bubble tea while you are queuing up for the seat. I ordered a large milk green tea with pudding ( all-time favorite). And their new Yakult bubble tea is a great choice after the grease BBQ meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Kalbi tang, sul lang tang, dul bok kee were all tasty and decent prices. Would go again."}
{"text":"Seats were comfy , the place was very clean, service was fast but impersonal. The seats were sufficient but somehow our waitress insisted on rushing our table out of the restaurant. When I asked for more water she said no and insisted we leave . Food was good though."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Korean restaurant in the area. Tucked west on Finch, it's always packed during dinner time and on weekends. Biggity big portions!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite. They're open 24hrs and the food is comforting and always hot fresh and really delicious."}
{"text":"They do not let you go if you do not pay tip. Like usual korean restaurants, you have to go up to the cash register to pay. If you have left a cash tip on the table and want to pay the bill with a card, they will start asking why you didn't add tip to the machine. And let's be real, the service isn't even that great to be deserving a lot of tip"}
{"text":"This place has got a lot going for it: their food is fresh, they're open 24 hours, the menu is extensive, and so far they're doing quite well judging by the long wait during peak meal times. I heard different stories about the ownership but the main thing is that they were associated with Im Ga Nae in North York once upon a time, which was also a 24-hour joint. I recognized our waitress as one who used to serve us at Im Ga Nae too! One reviewer mentioned that the samgyupsal (pork belly) was cut thinner than at other BBQ restos, and that was actually something I did NOT like about Im Ga Nae, so hopefully they'll cut that nonsense out as I am sure one day I will end up here wanting samgyupsal at 4am and will be thoroughly disappointed if they bring me a plate of bacon-thin slices of meat!

While waiting in line, you get a pretty good idea of the range of different dishes on offer: BBQ, soups, stews, noodles, rice dishes, etc. The food must be pretty damn good as I saw one table of three super-thin girls order enough food for at least eight people! There was barely enough room to place all this endless amount of food! Note that portions are pretty big, and as one other reviewer mentioned, the menu prices do include the tax so don't be alarmed. You're definitely getting your money's worth here. You also get a range of banchan (side dishes) which can vary from day to day. 

After waiting about 20 minutes for a seat, we ended up at a table where we had to sit cross-legged, traditional styles, which would not have been my first choice, but I didn't want to wait to eat any longer. You get these faux-Gucci cushions to sit on but apart from that, there is very little comfort to be gained by sitting and eating this way. Some people don't mind, I guess. My legs tend to fall asleep when I sit for too long like this and stretching them out while eating means someone is going to get kicked. 

We ordered the jummulluk (non-marinated marbled beef) for two ($40) which came with a small choice of soups--we opted for the soondubu--two bowls of purple rice, and of course, an array of banchan. The soondubu was not at all spicy and contained mostly seafood, kimchi, and soft tofu. The broth had a very seafood-y flavor, moreso than when you order seafood soondubu in other restos. The waitress remembered me from Im Ga Nae and made sure they threw in some extra beef, which was cool as it was pretty delish. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and it appeared that other diners did too. What we got could have easily fed three people! The place was rammed with mostly Korean families and visa students the night we went but there was also a smattering of others. And the wait staff do speak English so not to worry. 

Service is good but when it's really busy, you may have to wait a little longer for things. The place is pretty cramped--it used to be Urraca which for some reason I remember being bigger than this? Maybe with the different layout, it seemed bigger, or maybe it was all the fluffy winter coats all over the place that made me feel suffocated, I don't know, but space can be a little cramped. This applies also to surface space for your food--especially if you order BBQ or chunggol, which I suppose is normal, but we had to leave our lettuce wraps and a couple of other things on the ledge next to where we sat. I was afraid something would fall over and land in someone's shoes if someone were to walk by too swiftly! Either way, check this place out--anytime! Just remember not to wear something too nice if you're ordering BBQ as you will be grilling it at your table."}
{"text":"Servers are very rude and seem like they hate their job. I live upstairs in the condo beside, I've been here a few times and servers pretend to not see you when you put your hand up. Server rolled their eyes like I was stupid when I placed an order. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pork BBQ also comes with a tofu soup and rice. The price is reasonable for $30. They have traditional korean table. We also ordered pork bone soup, it is very good! The great thing is they open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Korean food. Although their tables and set up is kind of awkward especially if you're going with a big group.  I went with 8 others and we had to split up as they only have 2 large seating areas for big groups which were taken. 

The place gets pretty busy and they dont take reservations on the weekend (starting Friday), so if you have a large group, be ready to wait from 45 minutes to an hour for a split table. 

Service: Really good service. All waiters/waitresses are very attentive and quick with your ordering and refilling of water, sauces, extra lettuce, etc. Never had to wait for more than 2 minutes for anything we asked for. Turn around time for tables is very quick and the place is clean. 

Food: Food is pretty good. I wouldn't say it was anything crazy special, but you will enjoy your meal. They bring your dishes to you very quickly!! We ordered and got all our apps and food within 7 minutes. We ordered the porkbelly lettuce wrap, medium size fried chicken dish and a seafood soup. The large soup was better in taste at OGBG, but still pretty good. Porkbelly was not overly fat and as I said before, the refills on lettuce was spot on so we were never waiting for more lettuce as the food was cooking. The only thing is that they don't allow you to grill the jalapenos on the hot grill. We attempted too (cause we were able to at other restaurants) but one of the waitors asked us to remove it from the grill due to ventilation? Not a big issue, but it was different I suppose. 

As most Korean restaurants, you will come out smelling like what you've cooked and ate. The smell is VERY strong here since the place is kind of small and ventilation (I assume via jalapenos remark) is not the best. I would come back to eat but nothing to rave about. 

Other bonus is that it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened to this place lately. Service has gone down the drain. I have noticed it over my last few visits; the staff seems to be busy tending to other chores and neglecting their customers. During my last visit I sat down and a waitress brought me some tea and a menu. I waited for 10 minutes for someone to come and take my order but nothing. Then a couple walks in and sit down. At this point I have been waiting with consideration and thinking... well.. they must be busy and will be coming over soon. But when I see the couple getting side dishes and being served their food I just got up and left. I think that some bussines owners should be reminded that the reason of their existence is us, the customers. Without customers there is no business, no profits, no jobs. I will be trying the many other Korean restaurants alternatives around the neighborhood for the next little while. I hope that the customer service improves in this restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this place.  We've tried a lot of good, authentic, flavourful Korean places in North York, but this place is not one of them.  The ribs for 2 cooked on your table was rough and poorly seasoned.  I have done much better ribs myself at home.  Side dishes were boring particularly the kim chi was a let down.  Pricey parking nearby as well."}
{"text":"I only ventured into Huh Ga Ne because my Korean friend told me that the owner of \"Lim Ga Ne\" sold his business and opened up \"Huh Ga Ne\" instead. After coming here for dinner last Friday, I can confirm that the original chef does not make the dishes here. 

The sweet & sour pork appeared as if it was re-heated. The pork was supposed to be deep-fried first, but it tasted soggy. The sauce was clumpy with jello-like texture. 

There's around 8 side dishes that comes with the meal, I almost wished I just ordered rice! We also ordered the fatty pork lettuce wrap (not sure what the Korean name is) - the pork was sliced thinner than other places and not fatty enough (according to my Korean friends). To sum it up, the meat was not juicy at all and the dish would have been very dry if not for the kimchi. 

We were seated in the \"Take Off Your Shoes\" area, and I regretted the decision in less than 10 minutes. There's no back support, so my back was aching by the time we finished dinner. My legs kept going numb from sitting cross-legged.. I don't know how everyone else is doing it. 

They're open 24-hours as well, and on Friday night it was packed! Be prepared to line up, but I wouldn't waste my time."}
{"text":"I've never given a review based on service before...but after being yelled at by the staff here on multiple occasions, I need to voice out. I usually come here with friends because of the favourable location, but we've been...
-chased after to tip more
-told to be quiet rudely by the owner
-yelled at to order faster
-been pushed aside while we were lining up

While I don't expect 5 star service, I think it's common courtesy to use an indoor voice when speaking to customers and exercise basic manners."}
{"text":"One of the worst service I have ever experienced in a Korean restaurant. I tried to give a zero star rating yet I can't. The serivice is very bad and slow, we waited for about an hour to be seated at the same time the waitress was rude and without any apologize. It is understandable that the place was really crowded and the waitress is hard to serve us, however, she shouted to us with no reason just because she needed to serve. We sitted for 30mins and the waitresses didn't even serve us water. While she was not being that rude to those Korean costumers. This was definitely a rasism restaurant and I will never ever come back again! Btw the food weren't that good either, you have lots of much better choices for Korean dishies in GTA, don't come here you will definitely regret."}
{"text":"VARY BAD SERVICE(the manager) AND LITERALLY ASK ME FOR 10% TIPS. like are you serious?? Went there with family tonight. The servants were alright. I went up to the lady manager and asked for some more fish cake and the raddish, she said 'okok' without even lifting her head and continue does her own stuff (talking+laughing with the servant beside her). I literally stood there, holding the 2 side dishes, for a minute straight. She pretty much ignored me in the first place. When I went up to pay my bill, it was $60. Gave $100, she return back a $20, a $10, a $5, a toonie and some loonies. I left $3 on the plate and ready to go, she immediately stopped me and pointing at the receipt saying '60, 60 dollar, 10%, 10% tips'(kept on repeating the word 10 percent) Since when tips option become a law?? I literally told her I'm not satisfied with her service and that has nothing to do with her servants but her. The food were okay but I would not go back to this place because of this lady manager."}
{"text":"Its pretty spacious so even if it gets busy it won't be a ridiculous wait. I was able to make a reservation but I think it depends on time day and number of people...so probably not during it's busiest dinner hours. We had to wait for a few friends who came a bit later and they didnt rush us to order. It leans towards a more traditional setting? to the best of my knowledge of Korean food which I admit is pretty limited. They have purple rice though! They have very decently priced main dishes like PBS for $9 which they don't charge additional tax. We tried the table top cooking of pork belly bbq and Army Stew! It was great and a very happy warm atmosphere :) We also had japchae and seafood pancake! Among 7 people, the bill was $15 per person (they dont charge additional tax on top of menu prices) + tips! We were all full and finished all the food, yum!

ps on friday and weekends they dont allow you to split the bill; luckily we went on a thurs otherwise its be frustrating with larger groups"}
{"text":"I had kalbi/kbbq in LA and this place was better. 

Even without dipping sauce the kalbi is BLESSED. marinaded to perfection and they even give you BONES to give to your dog after. 

10/10"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday at like 5:30 am since me and my boyfriend couldn't sleep and wanted Korean stew.  
Flies everywhere and the side dishes did not seem fresh. Really didn't enjoy the meal. 
It's too bad. I'd like a good Korean restaurant that's open 24-7."}
{"text":"literally my go-to for traditional, cheap korean eats. my usual is the soondae and the pork bone soup is to die for. i take all my friends here for late night snacks and honestly i haven't met anyone yet that hasn't liked the food here, its just that good !! also, its one of the very few restaurants in Toronto that carries bibimnaengmyun all year round, which is awesome because its delicious no matter the weather and the sauce here is the best (i recommend ordering extra sauce on the side). overall, yes definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Korean restaurants in the area, and you can tell by the number of Koreans that eat here. We ordered the LA kalbi ($20), pork bone soup ($10) and soon tofu. Everything was delicious and we always appreciate the little sides that come with the meal and the purple rice! I thought the kalbi was a bit expensive for the portion, but I have to admit that it was very tasty. Everything was served very quickly which was great since we could hardly stop ourselves from salivating from the smell. 

The seating was divided into two sections, one side with tables and the other where you remove your shoes and sit on pillows. Our legs were sore by the end, but we hardly noticed while eating. Taller people might find it harder to stretch their legs. 

Another point is that they are open 24hrs, but it does get busy during dinner even on weeknights. There is free parking on the small streets in front and at the back/side of the restaurant after 6pm if you can find it. We came here to eat and it was easy to find a bubble tea or dessert cafe in the same area afterwards."}
{"text":"The search for a great Korean restaurant end here. This location is usually very busy, especially during regular lunch and dinner hours. Although, they are great at getting a table set up quickly. The service is very basic but the staff is accommodating and attentive.

The food is second to none in the area. If you're looking for decently priced food (10$-30$) this is a great location. Amazingly enough, you would think that because this location is 24/7, something must be lacking but Huh Ga Ne proves that although they are busy 24/7, they are able to keep up. Would definetely recommend this resturant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Tucked away from the many restaurants along Yonge and Finch, this is for sure one of the better kbbq places for a very reasonable price. Can get quite busy and may need to line up, and they don't take reservation. 

Came here for table cooking after hearing that they do kbbq quite well, and I have to agree. Serving size was very generous - a portion for 2 was almost enough for 3 people. We got the pork belly table cooking which was seasoned very well. TIP: you have to ask for lettuce wrap, they don't serve it with the sauce / garlic as other kbbq places do. The table cooking also came 2 bowls of rice and a tofu stew, which was quite spicy but went well to down those carbs. There's also a tonnn of side dishes they serve, which are refillable! 

If that wasn't filling enough, I recommend getting their pork bone soup! Definitely better than the majority of the MANY other korean restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Popping into this Korean joint for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised! The serving portions are huge and the food came out quite quickly. The menu offers a variety of choices from the standard main dishes like bibimbap, fried rice and some stews. However, if you're feeling the chills from our current winter weather, there are also stews that are shareable between two people (or more). I also thought it was cute for them to have two types of sitting -- basic chair and table or table and mats. :) 

I ordered the chicken fried rice which came with lots of bits of chicken and purple rice (my fav). I instantly thought it would taste good and yeh dish definitely did not fail me. I ate half and packed away the rest but if you're fairly hungry, one plate would be a good serving size for one or a good shareable plate if you ordered a few things from the menu. 

Overall, I would definitely come back! There were lots of side dishes which can be refilled when requested. :)"}
{"text":"One of my go to Korean places when I'm in the area. Food is great and service is pretty face usually. Love how the restaurant is open 24/7 almost every day of the year. One thing is that the restaurant is very popular and wait times can be quite long if visited during peak hours."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. It's a good place for bbq. It's generally good. However, this one time, it was pretty bad when we ordered soups. I came a few more times after that and it was fine. I guess my bad experience was one off. If you are worried, stick to the bbq and you should be alright."}
{"text":"We get the pork belly table BBQ every time! The value is really good and good portion for 2. The side dishes are good and they refill them if you ask. The soup that came with the combo is really nice and I recommend to choose the tofu soup."}
{"text":"The place is super packed, always have a line waiting at the door.
We got the samgyupsal and budae jeongul for 3 people.
The portions were really good, both dishes were meant for 2 people, so for 3 people is was definitely enough. But for two people, one dish would probably not enough.
Each dish was 39 dollars, which is a tiny bit expensive for two people, since its not really enough for two people, so you'll probably have to get another smaller dish to share. But the quality of the food was great.
Even though it was super packed and super busy, the waitresses still paid attention to us (especially since we were in the corner, i was afraid we'd be neglected).
I will definitely come back again with my husband, and i recommend anyone to come here!"}
{"text":"Another 24/7 korean restaurant.

Ordered their pork bone soup.. great portion size, but the flavour wasn't all there, something was off about it. I love it when my soup is served when its still piping hot and bubbling, and it wasn't at all when the food came. So I was pretty disappointed. 
I went around 2pm and only a few tables were taken. Not sure how busy this place gets but service was good overall. 

Three stars just based on the pork bone soup. Will prob go back some other time to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"One of a Korean 24 hrs restaurant in North York. Pretty busy place. Friendly servers and owners. The service is speedy in my opinion. 
The price is reasonable and their fish soups are my probably my favorite Korean dish. :)
It lost one star because they haven't clean up the table next to mine during our mealtime. It attracts food flies close to our food as well. If they can improve it, definitely keep food hygiene and comfort environment for all patrons"}
{"text":"Huh Ga Ne is my go-to korean restaurant in Toronto. It's a 24/7 restaurant however it's always extremely busy around 6-8pm. 

PROS 
- lots of delicious side dishes - I would say they give more and better side dishes than other korean restaurants
- purple rice! 
- inexpensive - table cooking for 2 people is ~$30, other korean dishes are ~$10-15
- fast service - they bring out your food almost within 5 minutes after you order

CONS 
- does not take reservations, super long line if you go during dinner time
- staff are not very polite but you can see that they are all working their butts off because it's so busy 

My favourite is their pork bone soup ($9) and the pork belly table cooking ($30)! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Always consistent seevice and food. Ive been loving this place, however lately due to this restaurant being popular and being somewhat small restaurant, i couldn't dine here(busy 6-8pm)
Imo this place is best to go @ yonge&finch late night tho"}
{"text":"This place is pretty new and it looks more modern than many Korean places nearby. But they are still traditional enough to have a \"take off your shoes and sit\" area. Service was pretty good, but it's a non-factor to me in general. 

The menu looks good. They have lots of standard stuff like bibimbap or BBQ pork belly + a few dishes you won't easily find elsewhere. I saw top shell stir fry (or maybe it's called sea snail? Korean name is goel beang e). I also saw lamb hot pot. 

It took a while for me to decide what to eat as I didn't really intend to get Korean that day. We ended up getting a table hot pot. We had the Octopus/Beef hot pot. It's $30. I thought it was steep but apparently their prices include tax already (but not tip). The portion was decent in portion and they were not skimpy on ingredients. 

The hot pot was very flavorful and the side dishes were plentiful. But I was expecting it to be spicy. It wasn't. Oh well...it's still delicious in its own way. We couldn't finish it all (but mostly because my partner is a small eater). 

All in all, it's a decent place to eat, especially if you want to try a few unique dishes. I could not find a special reason to come again, or to avoid. If I'm in the area, it's certainly a valid choice if I want Korean."}
{"text":"I personally think this place is nothing special. The food is mediocre/similar to the rest of the Korean restaurants on finch and Yonge. There was, however, a huge menu.. So I kind of liked that. We ordered four dishes - Bibimbap, tofu stew, kimchi fried rice and.. I don't remember the name for the last one lol (refer to pics). I've had all of these dishes elsewhere and I personally don't think it was the best here. The tofu stew was good, kind of different. They added garlic to it, which gave it a kick. I haven't had this with garlic at other places, so this was a genuine surprise even though it's something so small. Service was quite slow, but it was full house so I didn't expect much from that department. Overall a decent experience but nothing extraordinary. Given another opportunity, I may come back.. If I'm in the area. Otherwise I wouldn't bother coming."}
{"text":"The service here can be a little slow sometimes considering how busy the place is, because there aren't enough servers. But aside from that, the food here is the bomb! The dukbokki, tonkatsu and soondae stew are all delish! Best part is that it's open 24 hours for those who want a quick meal late at night!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever... There was a fly in our hot pot...when we were packing our food... My bf found another insect moving in our seafood pancake..."}
{"text":"I bought a bottle of wine tonight. I just opened but didnt drink it. I felt so sad when the waitress didnt let me take that bottle home :("}
{"text":"Very close to my work so I come here for my lunch time to time. Love all the foods served here. They have much more taste than most of the places. However, I would appreciate much more if the service was better. The waitresses seem stressed out when they are serving (at least during busy times they are..). Other than that, a great place to eat Korean dishes."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.

There's usually a wait to be seated, but they're pretty quick at getting you a table. All the dishes I've tried - gamjatang, galbitang, kkanpunggi, dolsot bibimbap, tangsuyuk, the bulgogi and octopus hotpot (my favorite, but definitely needs at least 2 people) - have been flavorful, cooked well, and seasoned to perfection. The banchan is a good variety and I've never had an issue getting refills. I especially like the radish and the dried fish things. The prices are reasonable, they take card, and it's 24 hours. This is my go-to Korean restaurant now.

I've never had the KBBQ here but I really want to get some friends together and go at it. I've sat next to people ordering the kalbi and pork belly and it smells amazing.

110% recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 my go to table cooking for years. There's 2 things on the menu we always order: the kalbi table cooking for 2 and the beef japchae. The table cooking dish is actually good for 4 people if you order a variety of other stuff. This dish is marinated very well and the meat is tender. They also give you rice, lettuce wraps and sauce on the side and a free tofu soup!! The japchae is very flavourful and cooked well. Would definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Vibe:
The restaurant was clean. I like how they have tables and area that u can seat on a pad for a more Korean dining experience. 
The service was good. Greeting when enter and water filled frequently.
Food:
Bulgogi plate was good but pork bone hot pot was average. 
Price:
Low-medium"}
{"text":"Om nom nom. Warm and full and happy. Came right before the lunch rush. We were one of two tables occupied. It started to fill up about midway into our lunch though. Service is efficient, but not in a brusque way. Fairly pleasant, actually. Interesting thing to note: chopsticks and spoons are self serve from a container at the table. The chopsticks are disposable, but the spoons are metal. Side note: If you sit at the booths close to the door and the door opens, it can get chilly (but it's alright if you have a piping hot stew in front of you).

Had:

Black goat stew ($12) - single portion. Came with purple rice. Oddly enough, my rice came when they brought the banchan to the table (about 5-10 minutes before my stew came out). What that meant was that my rice got to cool down before my stew came. Not a good thing, but something I can live with because my stew was still boiling when it came to the table. Goat stew had a lot of bean sprouts in it. I thought there wasn't that much goat, but there was a decent amount. It was shredded and boneless goat, for those of you who dislike having bones in your meat. It was quite tender, and had a mild goat taste. Soup was spicy and delicious. Love that they sprinkled perilla seeds on top. I like the crunch.

Dolsot bibimbap ($10) - What I really like is that the dolsot bibimbap and the regular bibimbap are the same price. Dolsot is the one in the stone bowl, for those of you who aren't familiar with the term. It usually costs a dollar more than its non stone bowl counterpart. Big bowl of bibimbap. My mom only finished about half of it.

Banchan: 7 dishes here, which is a plus in my books. Kimchi, radish kimchi, sprouts, wakame salad, pickled radish, spicy fish cake slices, and dried anchovies and peanuts in a seasoned soy sauce.

Awesome bonus: These prices are tax (but not tip) included. Yep. Their menu prices are exactly what you pay (sans tip)!"}
{"text":"Amazing Korean foods at a 24hrs place, how is that possible! Got there at 7 and the place was pack. People were lining out to the door, waiting to be seated. We had a party of 7, waited about 30mins was not bad at all. Ordered the short rib, pork belly, for Korean bbq. The entree comes with rice and a full size soup, option of seafood or tofu.  Pork bone soup was good, but we could have skip it since the soup that come with the entree was a full size. Appetizer we ordered pancake and that was amazing, not too starchy, just brought scallion and seafoods. Their jap chae was kinda on the wet side but the taste was not ruined. The sides that comes with the entree also was good with all the traditional Korean bbq side, but refills was not fast enough for us. For such a crowed busy place, 5 workers was not enough, therefore it did effect their services. Felt rush, when our beef short rib came out, they didn't let us cook it as we go, but she literally dumped the beef all right onto the grill grrrr! When your sides are done, you have to request for refills and that was not great! She literally took our old plate and put more into the same plate, hmm not sure about that service there lol. Giving this place a 4stars for the foods, and wish there a separate rating for services cause they should only get a 1 for it."}
{"text":"This place is not bad for a 24hr place, certainly better than the other 24/hr places at yonge and finch, like dingy kayagum and barely-passing-their-health-inspection pyung won house.

The restaurant is large, for a korean place, Half the restaurant is normal seating, the other half is traditional ground seating, which is a bit uncomfortable since the tables seem smaller than usual. If you're a normal sized asian or bigger, this isn't going to work well for you. My boyfriend was definitely bending and twisting into every shape before he got (barely) comfortable.

The service is blunt, but at least they're quick. The food came fairly fast but nobody brought us napkins or even water. They just put two spoons on the bare table, which is not cool. The workers are all busy even though they're definitely not understaffed. They're very rushed and that's not good, because one ended up dropping a whole 24 case of bottled beer, which made a huge mess and commotion. R e l a x ! 

The food is good though. Kalbi tang was very warm, soothing and tasty. Boyfriend surely enjoyed his donkatsu. Portions are large and the side dishes are fresh and tasty. I definitely want to come back to try the korean bbq!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup here is always my go to order. You really can't beat the quality, quantity and satisfaction levels you get. As a kicker it's only $9, much less than competitors around the area that aren't as delicious and give you less. 

I also really enjoy their pan fried fish (don't remember what it's called). Just a headsup, it's the entire fish (not a fillet). 

The kbbq is also really good, it's quite authentic, you will definitely end up smelling like korean bbq after a sit in meal. If you're going during mealtimes on friday or weekend, expect to wait for a seat, but with takeout, they're super fast. Sitting in can get quite busy."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed their food, very tasty. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The place we originally wanted to go to closed down so we ended up coming here. First impressions weren't great I'll say this now. The staff seemed indifferent, the layout was kinda cramped, and a lot of the meat dishes seemed a bit pricey. 

Once we ordered however, (I got the dolsot bibimbap, my mom got the pork cutlet (don katsu)) my opinion of this place slowly changed. There were plenty of side dishes and the waitresses seemed happy to attend you as long as you get their attention. The portions seemed small, especially considering the price, but don't be fooled because by the end of it I couldn't have another bite if I'd wanted to. The bibimbap was nice and hot packed with all the goodies and the don katsu was rather tender unlike most other places (the sauce was pretty subpar and they don't give you enough rice though). 

All in all it took some time for me to warm up to this place however that initial impression I got ultimately prevents this place from getting that 5th star. 

I'd suggest getting the non-bbq dishes as you get more bang for your buck however if you've got the money to spend and looking for some good grilling you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I must say I'm a bit disappointed with this place. I came in for Korean grill but very limited options for beef.
I ordered short ribs but got strips and the waitress dumped the entire serving on the gas stove (as shown in pic)
All the while we've had servers come over to our table and turn off the stove without saying a word, leaving us wondering how should we continue cooking the food!
I wouldn't recommend based on their service."}
{"text":"One of the worst service I have ever experienced in a Korean restaurant. I tried to give a zero star rating yet I can't. The serivice is very bad and slow, we waited for about an hour to be seated at the same time the waitress was rude and without any apologize. It is understandable that the place was really crowded and the waitress is hard to serve us, however, she shouted to us with no reason just because she needed to serve. We sitted for 30mins and the waitresses didn't even serve us water. While she was not being that rude to those Korean costumers. This was definitely a rasism restaurant and I will never ever come back again! Btw the food weren't that good either, you have lots of much better choices for Korean dishies in GTA, don't come here you will definitely regret."}
{"text":"Their soondae is the best in the entire city!!! Mmmmmmm! I also really enjoyed their spicy crispy chicken. Take a look at the wall and you will see a poster for grapefruit soju. Trust me on this : order it ASAP! I love everything here and it's my favorite Korean restaurant in the entire city. And it's 24/7. Seriously? That's a game changer!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested Huh Ga Ne for dinner because he mentioned whenever his friends passed by, there would always be a long line up for a table. Where the lines were, it should be where the good food is at haha. It was true! We enjoyed our dinner here! We chose to sit at the tatami area (you sit on the floor and it's heated!) Service was great, our server came back regularly to cook our kalbi meat for us.

We ordered the:
* KALBI - Table cooking for two ($40):
(It comes with 6 different side dishes, garlic, sauce and lettuce; plus a choice of seafood soup / tofu soup)

I think the whole set was really worth it. The portion was perfect for two people. I loved the kalbi meat. It was marinated nicely and full of flavour. It wasn't that oily because the shape of the cooking pot curved inwards, so the oil was drained out pretty quickly.

The tofu soup that came with the dinner set was also very delicious. Regular flavour isn't too spicy. 

I'd recommend this restaurant for those looking for something to warm their tummies on a cold winter day! The line built up pretty quickly (at around 7 pm) so either book in advance or go early for a table (We came here at around 6 pm)."}
{"text":"??,mark here, cheap and delicious! Good place to go with friends!!!     Good for group"}
{"text":"Food are delicious. Very authentic and flavourful. Their menu offers a large variety of Korean dishes. Prices are very fair for the portions you get. Table cooking can get slightly expensive though. 24/7 operation is a huge bonus. Service-wise, speed is decent but the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired. Overall an awesome place to get your fix of Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"Good location, price, and food (just avoid hot pot menus if you're looking for the authentic korean hot pot experience, because it just doesn't taste the same). My go-to dishes are Soondae, Cold noodles, Spicy rice cake, and K-bbq. Staffs are friendly and it does get busy on the friday and weekend dinners. Close to the TTC and parking spaces are available."}
{"text":"We were not planning on coming over here originally. We were supposed to go to the Korean restaurant beside this for chicken. It turned out that the hours posted in Yelp wasn't accurate, it wasn't open until 430 pm . Anyhow, this place was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to be so so like other 24hr Korean restaurants. When we came in the place was clean (unlike Owl of Minerva with the sticky floors and unpleasant odour or Kayagum with soiled seats and stinky tables). This place serves better banchan and they dont skimp. We ordered kalbi, it was a huge erving.  Tender and juicy meat paired with purple rice, bf was in meat heaven. I ordered my favorite gamjatang but didn't expect much. It turned out this was better than others I've tried. Meat was fall off the bone tender. I wish I requested for a spicier version. I'm curious to try other dishes. It's a good thing its  open 24 hours, I can give in to Korean food cravings anytime of the day or night for that matter."}
{"text":"BBQ sirloin beef with lettuce wrap and rice $40
Came with a tofu soup and a bunch of side dishes all pretty good
The beef was not really fresh as I have seen in other places
The cuts of meat were frozen and many pieces were frozen together
A super filling meal for two people and it probably would have fed three"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for a long time, but I've never wrote a review. However, events today have really pushed me to write one. 

To begin, the food is fantastic, although it can be a bit inconsistent in taste at times. Service is typical Asian resto style - quick, curt, but efficient. However, if you don't mind the \"ok\" service, don't let it stop you from trying out their food. Their prices are very reasonable as well.

The reason I am giving Huh Ga Ne 2 stars is mostly because of the service I received today. The restaurant was packed as usual, and we just finished our meal. Our table was on the upper seating area (where we had to leave our shoes at the bottom). As we left to go pay for our meal, I began looking for my shoes but much to my dismay they were NOT THERE.

I'm gonna give whoever took my shoes the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they accidentally took my shoes. I'm also gonna assume that the person is a girl with pretty small feet, because I don't think a grown ass man would want my shoes. Anyway, I approached the waitresses with my dilemma, and told them that someone may have taken my shoes. They were understandably confused, but were too busy to give a crap and quickly forgot about me, leaving me to stand barefoot on the floor like an idiot.

I'm a reasonable person, I wasn't mean nor accusing because I knew it was obviously not their fault that some idiot took my shoes. What I was upset about was that no one really tried to help me out!! I had to wave down the waitress again and explain to them that I have no way of getting home, because no way in heck am I WALKING BAREFOOT home! And that I need someone to do something NOW.

The guy at the cashier (I'm assuming the owner's son), was the most infuriating. He had no idea what to do with me, mostly just standing around absolutely confused out of his mind. Finally, one of the employees had the bright idea of lending me some slippers (yay!), and I proceeded to ask him if I could leave my number with them, just in case the person decides to return my shoes. We were contemplating whether to just leave the restaurant without paying, because we were just so upset with the whole situation. However, after some consideration we decided we would just pay for our meal anyway since it wasn't really their fault that my shoes were stolen. However, we refused to leave any tips because I was just so angry at the whole situation.

I have always been understanding of their service because of how busy they are, but events today have really made me reconsider that. Maybe the fact that they don't speak English all that well may have made the situation more difficult to process, but still there was no reason to just ignore me! I feel that when something happens to your customer (no matter how extraordinary the situation), it is your responsibility to step up and do something about it. Just don't leave me standing there and hope I'll just leave so that you won't need to deal with the problem, because NO, I won't leave.

So to the Girly that took my Navy Blue Toms, GIVE THEM BACK! I left my number with the restaurant just in case you have the conscience to return what is not yours! I have a feeling I know which customer took my shoes, so if you happen to read this, return my shoes! If I ever see you on the street, I will not hesitate to ask you about it! Don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"24/7 blessssss these places because man I love me some Korean food! So this place is quite packed whenever I go so be warn! The food here is quite good! I had the pork cutlet and it is a fairly decent size compared to other Korean places! They have a seating area with no chairs so you take your shoes off and sit. Another area is with chairs, which is much better in my opinion (since I have big thighs). 

It does seem a bit small hence it can be quite packed at times. There is another 24/7 Korean place nearby but I think this one is much better then that one. The side dishes are similar to most Korean restaurants. They didn't bring us any tea or cups or any sort. Even when they gave us chopsticks and spoons there wasn't any napkins and anything said from the waiter. He just dropped it down and went back to the middle and just watched people. 

Will probably come back here again. Hoping for better service!"}
{"text":"I come to Hug Ga Ne whenever I visit Toronto. They open 24 hours! Their Sun dae guk (Korean soup made of pork blood and noodle sausages) makes me think of my hometown. It is a food I would love to eat after flying for hours. Very mild comfy food, but if you add hot paste, it is also excellent. 
They also serve Korean BBQ, which is great. But I found their ventilation is not good enough for Korean BBQ. Many people make table BBQ in evenings, so I prefer to go in the morning to eat Sun dae guk."}
{"text":"So yummy! I ordered the bulgogi bbq and it tasted AMAZING. ON the menu, it says it serves two people, but you can actually serve 3 and still have a little leftover. This may be because they spoil you with around 10 side dishes including assorted kimchi and veggies as well as a seafood soup and purple glutinous rice. I also ordered a beef soup with glass noodles and was disappointed with how bland it tasted. Our bulgogi was cooked for us by some staff and the food came out really fast. Good service, good pricing, and will visit again in the near future:)"}
{"text":"-There is no ventilation in this place so you gonna walk out smelling like korean food. 
-Bad service but that's to be expected anyways. 
-Food is decent for a 24 hours joint. 

My fav dishes were the bulgogi stew and the short ribs. Incredibly flavorful stew and the short ribs were perfectly medium rare. 

Pass the kimchi stew, bland and kimchi was not sour enough."}
{"text":"Great place to go to at night when everything is closed and you're looking for some homey food to eat with your girl after a long night . Customer service is ok and can take a while to get their attention but the food is really good and they have generous portions. The pork bone soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"- 24hr spot with GOOD food (rare)
- Cheap and will definately fill you up
- Service isn't friendly but FAST. Need to be assertive when asking a server to come by. 
- Pork Bone Soup most common order. 
- The korean side dishes are excellent"}
{"text":"Love this place because it's open 24 hours. Most of the times we came its been full. There would always be a short wait. It's a typical Korean restaurant but has both floor seating and regular table seating. You must take off your shoes for floor seating. 

I've always ordered from the kbbq section of the menu, never actually ordered anything else. The BBQ sets usually come with the regular set of side dishes, two bowls of rice, a bowl of soup, some lettuce, two different sauces and the plate of meat. I find that the meat they have here is higher quality than most places. The beef is usually marbled and soft. The soup is strong and flavourful. I prefer the soybean soup over the other choice. The set is very filling for two people. 

I would really recommend this place as it's one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times but haven't got time to write them a decent review, so here it is!

It's always my go-to restaurant for Korean BBQ. The restaurant is big and clean. It's divided into 2 sections: half is regular seating and the rest is ground seating. This place is always a full house, especially during dinner. And since this place opens 24/7, be aware that you may have to line up and wait for seating. 

But trust me, their BBQ won't let you down. Don't let the $40 - $45/dish (table cooking on the menu) shock you because the portion is very decent and generous! It's definitely now for 2 but enough for 3 or 4. Their BBQ was well seasoned. Remember to ask for lettuce and sauce because normally they won't serve you like other Korean BBQ restaurants. It also comes with rice and spicy soup on the side. Don't even get me started on their side dishes. They are fresh, tasty and refillable of course. 

The service is hit and miss but I'm not blaming them. They have to run other tables as well.

Highly recommend this place for Korean BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good for a 24 hour place. A little pricey but would definitely come back. Walking into the restaurant the aroma makes you hungry."}
{"text":"Decent food. Good price and opened 24 hours. We got their pork bone soup and LA ribs for a late night snack and it was exactly what we needed!"}
{"text":"In the Yonge/Finch area, there is an amassment of Korean restaurants and a good chunk of them probably serve Korean BBQ. 

Huh Ga Ne is one of two that I recommend going to - the other one is In Ga Ne, funny enough (from what I hear, Huh Ga Ne and In Ga Ne owners used to work together, and then split off to do their own thing).

There is bonchon-a-plenty here: seaweed salad, two types of Kimchi, dried fish and peanuts to name a few.

We ordered the Ju Mul Luck - thinly sliced Sirloin beef in their special sauce. Very tender meat, wrapped in a lettuce leaf with garlic and onion. The quality of meat is a lot better than many KBBQ places. None of the pieces were unpleasantly chewy.

An order of meat to grill comes with a choice of two soups: Seafood Soon Tofu or Fermented Bean Soup. We got the soon tofu, packed with large pieces of tofu and seafood. It was a nice change of pace from the mounds of meat we ate.

For what you get (it was around $40, before tax), you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My friend and I were meeting in the area and we got a recommendation for this place. Did not know it was open 24 hours! The place was insanely busy with people waiting outside for tables. We got there early so we didnt have to wait long (around 6:30pm), but by the time we were leaving, there were a lot of people waiting.

The inside is pretty cool with people eating hot pots, sharing food at the elevated tables so you need to take off your shoes, and a different area for shoes on. 

Our service was was quick and to the point. When we sat for a little too long for their taste, we were handed the bill on the table without words. HST is included - wow! 

I was surprised that the menu had simplified chinese on it, and thought maybe this place was run by mainland Chinese, but it's hard to tell if were because all the servers were korean and everything felt it (joint venture? Great marketing?)

My friend  had a dumpling soup ($8). The dumpling was just okay but the soup was really good. I had the kalbi (beef short ribs) ($19) and it came on a sizzling plate with scissors. The portion was large but i thought i wouldnt be able to finish everything when it came, but oh I totally did. 

Really liked the place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go to in Willowdale! I like the fact that they are open 24 hours so they can satisfy your Korean needs. The first time I came, they had the tables near the floor where seats are needed and that was cool. I got the bimbim naengmyeon and it was pretty tasty. The side dishes were really really good, I enjoyed the anchovies. I also tried dolsot bimbimbap, the portion was smaller than other places and it tasted okay. Other than that, I do like coming here as service is attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Decent Korean foods that open 24/7. Came here at 1AM and I was really surprised that it was full house. We ordered the Soondae Guk (Korean sausage stew) and Kalbi Tang (beef ribs soup). The broth both were good enough, especially it is one of the few restaurants that open at midnight. The sausage portion was generous, it was also tasty and quite spicy. Kalbi tang has the flavor of the beef broth that was quite light but it was good enough.  I love that they also give generous amount of side dishes, including fish cakes, seaweed salad, kimchi, etc... 
A lot of other people around me had table cooking, either K-bbq or Hotpot, made me wonder if their table cooking are that delicious. Service was efficient as we got our goods after 5 minutes. Waitresses are very nice. 

Overall, I recommend this restaurant and will come back again. One of the better options at night time in the area instead of any other fast-food restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I want to eat hot pot or grill meat or even noodle any time of the day. But I am happy that Huh Ga Ne is open 24 hours!

The wait staff here is pleasant and speak good English but I shouldn't have any problem to read the menu as it is printed in Korean, English and Chinese!

Duck with Vegetable in Hot Pot ($30) Ori Jeon Gol is labelled as spicy but lack the spice even when the lady reassured me that it is spicy. She did go and get extra seasonings to help spice it up for us. The duck though was a little tough, I probably won't be ordering it again. But It was not bad for a cold day.

There are also other traditional Korean comfort food: soup, noodle, bbq, blood sausage, pig's feet and more.

At first glance, the pricing seems to be a little higher than other neighbourhood's restaurants but the pricing includes HST. 

I will be back, especially at the strange hours on a cold day.... eating Hot Pot and other Korean's comfort food just make me feel nice and warm. Or I come back to eat some pig's feet with a cold beer?"}
{"text":"(I hope the owner is reading this because it's in English get a translator because no one at huh ga ne speaks English!!!!)

-good food
-big portions
-bad service and unfriendly unless you are Korean and can ONLY speak Korean as no one here speaks any English or speaks very little of it 

Also there's plenty of side dishes included and can be refilled 

The service is and always will be s*** we asked for lemons and the lady brought us a menu saying we don't sell it so we were confused after we repeated 5 times we just want lemon slices she understood 
(all of the servers speak no to very very little English are they illegals or something?!)

anyways we were halfway finishing our meal and one of them brings us the bill which i find REALLY RUDE we DID NOT ASK FOR THE BILL!
it's as if they think we were going to dine & dash even though we've been here MANY times"}
{"text":"Came here to try out the kbbq as the pictures people have posted made it look so good. It did not disappoint. I went with my family of 4, and we got kalbi and pork belly (each of the orders required minimum of two orders). These orders also includes a soup, I believe one was tofu soup and one was soybean soup. 

As for the meat, they did not skimp out on the portions of pork belly or the kalbi. The pork belly had a good mix of ones with layers of fat, and ones a bit more lean (but still some fat). That worked out with my family as my mom doesn't like tooo many layers of fat. There were enough side dishes to go with the food as well. As the usual Korean restaurants, side dishes were unlimited refills, as well as the lettuce. It reminded me of being in Korea.

The Kalbi was marinated very well with lots of flavors and we tried not to overcook it, so it wasn't too tough.

The only downside was that there was no ventilators above each table, so it can get a bit stuffy inside. 

In the end, we were all satisfied, and had food leftover to pack. I can't wait until the next time I go!"}
{"text":"I order the sama BBQ beef that i always order last time. They only give me like half of the meat as usual. I do complain about it, and the girl just put the beef in chair n ignore me. And i ask again, she keep ignore me. WON'T COME AGAIN"}
{"text":"Really good food although the service is not that great, some rude servers but overall a good experience. We ordered T1 ribs for two, and it was well enough for two people, meat was very good, tofu soup was great, and a lot of side dishes. The rice is not the best and we did not finish it."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 4 stars. Every single time I go, its packed with people. The food has never disappointed me and prices are affordable. 

My recommendations include their kimchi chigae (prob had that like 8 times by now) and makchang gui. 

Only critique is their waitresses' attitude. Theyre not really the smiley type but they try their best to get their job done. Its quite chaotic cause there are so many customers and not that much walking space.

Dont know about you but I rather have great food at great prices if it means foregoing a super friendly server."}
{"text":"My favorite place. The foods are good. Price is so cheap and many side dishes. I like the fish and peanut side dish, but seem like they don't have it now. Busy in the dinner time but reasonable."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like going \"tanning\" (that's my term for eating Kam Ja Tang), Huh Ga Ne, is always my go-to place. Food is great, service is fast and prices are affordable. Also, their Sam gyop sal and seafood pancake is pretty good too. 

Now the only downside to this place this that it's ALWAYS packed so expect a 15-30 minute line up during dinner. Another thing, half of the tables are the low tables where one must seat cross-legged. So it might not be the most comfortable but it certainly is somewhat authentic."}
{"text":"Good and very authentic korean place in the area! I tried dolsot bibimbab and kimchi stew and couldn't finish neither. Good portion sizes and fresh food. Love the side dishes."}
