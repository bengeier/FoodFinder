{"text":"This place used to be one of those self serve froyo joints, of which there were several that opened in this neighbourhood none of which survived. The current owners were smart enough to put in a full kitchen and add a tasty Vietnamese baguette, pho and ramen menu. They also serve a variety of French fries. The baguettes and ramen are delicious and inexpensive. The frozen yogurt aspects still remain, now with more generic signage. I've eaten here about four times now and the food is always fresh and tasty. Don't let its improvised appearance turn you off. It's a nice addition to the beach neighbourhood and I hope it does well."}
{"text":"I come to Cool Star very often as the Vietnamese food is authentic and delicious! I Pho is amazing and the grilled chicken vermicelli bowl is absolutely amazing. The food is fresh made to order.

I asked the manager of the store if we can have a birthday party there and she agreed. We ordered sandwiches for 30 people and fries. We decorated ourselves and brought plates and napkins. It was really great! Everyone loved the food, yogurt and Vietnamese coffee at the end! From there we headed on to the park."}
{"text":"Great value fresh food. I got a whole wheat vegan wrap and it was fresh and only $6! The decor and music isn't for me and the food won't blow your mind, but I'd go back for sure."}
