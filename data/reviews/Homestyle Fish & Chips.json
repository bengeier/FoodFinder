{"text":"I love this place. Stumbled across it awhile back and my whole family loves it.  Great portions, great price and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer for many years now.  I loved the huge pieces of fish and the great taste of the fish and batter.  However, recently I've noticed that the portions are smaller than they used to be and one order of fish and chips is not quite enough for a lunch.  Hope they go back to the way it was."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic fish n chips. I loved how the halibut was so white and flakey and just flaked apart in your mouth and just was so delicious and it makes you want more. From what I've eaten, the Popcorn Shrimp is well seasoned and the fries are very good however it would be great as a customer for them to be a little crunchier rather than mushy, however sometimes I can understand if they are busy and are trying to rush out fries but it would be nice to get them a little crunchier. The decor is a nice warm feeling and the seating is much more than expected. Just fantastic fish n chips."}
{"text":"Very old fashion style restaurant, fish was okay but not a place I would recommend. Fries were not crispy as well."}
{"text":"After reading a couple of reviews online, decided to visit the place today and order some takeouts. Family combo 1 = 3 halibuts + 2 chips = $35. Great food and service and reasonably priced. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Cute, yummy place. Nothing fancy though. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"DO NOT TIP!. The TIPS DO NOT GO TO THE WAITERS THEY GO TO THE OWNERS. The waiters are forced to give all the tips to the owners. The owners also pay their employees in cash but force them to pay taxes which they calculate from a book but the employees don't then get it back in income tax because the owners never claim it. This place is very unethical and don't treat their employees properly, I would recommend taking your business somewhere else. Restaurants are not just about the food there is also an ethical component. Go somewhere where they respect their employees and don't steal their wages!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service! We just moved into the area and wanted to try this place as it is good Friday. When I called to find out about ordering for pickup later in the day, she said they don't do that. When I tried to ask about average wait times around dinner, she hung up on me. If they want customers on every other day of the year, then they may want to work on their customer service skills. I recommend driving the extra ten minutes down the road to the best fish and chips place in the city!"}
{"text":"I give them a strong 3.5 stars  I ordered the halibut and chips for take-out. I thought the fries could use some work but I came here for the fish more than anything. I would skip  the fries and just get the halibut because it's pretty darn filling on it's own!  Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is a Mom and Pops style eatery. You order and pay at the counter then take a seat in the small dining room or on the seats against the wall for takeout orders. The staff will bring your order to the table for eat-in orders. If you want tap water, ask at the counter and it will come with your order.   I went in on a Wednesday at 11:50am for the lunch special, which was one big piece of Haddock with french fries. We ordered two of the specials for $5.95 each, one large coleslaw $1.50 and a small cup of gravy $.50. The fish and chips are made fresh. Coleslaw was just the right amount of creaminess and not too sour. Gravy is fine. Note if you come in the evening the same dish is more expensive. Can't remember exact amount but it's approximately $10.   Specials are only Monday to Fridays at lunch time. Credit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"Have been going there for last 4 yrs . Freshly fried and best in the area. Reasonably priced and great customer service."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 7:30pm. All the tables were full but it's not somewhere you sit for a long time so it wasn't too hard to get a table. Don't go in expecting a typical restaurant - you order first and find a seat and then the waitresses will bring you your food.  As their name states, they are a fish and chips restaurant so the menu items do not stray far from that. They have Basa and chips, Cod and chips or Halibut and chips and grilled Salmon if you aren't looking for anything deep fried.  he restaurant is not very big and has maybe 12 tables at most. That doesn't stop customers from coming because the whole time we were there, they had a very steady flow of hungry customers coming in. They also close extremely early for a restaurant, 8 or 9 depending on the day. That's also a sign of how popular their restaurant is if they can afford to close so early.  I decided to get the Halibut and chips. The fish tasted very fresh and the batter wasn't too thick, which is usually a characteristic of whether you are eating good or bad fish and chips. The portion size is more than generous with a good price, you can get a plate of Halibut and Chips for a little bit more than $10. I personally prefer thinner fries but the fries also tasted very fresh and if you like home style fries, this is definitely right up your alley.  highly recommended for fish & chips!"}
{"text":"Lunch special here is definitely worth trying! Haddock or Cod with chips and coleslaw for $5.95 also includes drink."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in a while. But every time i go its never a disappointment =)  Love this resturant hope it stays in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Really delicious, simple fish and chips. The fish is soft and fresh, and the batter is crispy and delicious. Seating is kind of limited, but it usually will have just enough for it's patrons. It has a really lovely Ma and Pop establishment feel to it.  I guess my only qualm is kind of the mood, it doesn't really feel like a happy place, despite the good food.  But anyways, come by and give this great fish a try! :)"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not that big a fan of fish and chips. I don't really enjoy fried things and I couldn't really tell the difference in flavor between the basa and haddock. That said, the fish was fried really well and it wasn't too oily. Tartar sauce goes really well with it and fries are tasty.  DÃ©cor - who really cares? It's clean so that's all that matters and my eyes don't bleed when I walk in so that's cool.  What I wanted to say was that they have great service here; they really know how to please their customers and admit mistakes, something very rare in this day and age. I went in with my parents and ordered 3 haddock plates, 1 with an upgraded poutine. They gave us the fish and fries normally for 2 plates but the last one came with only haddock at first since the poutine was going to take a while. It ended up taking a long time though as the poutine still had not arrived even when both my parents had finished their plates. After reminding the staff though, they quickly brought out the poutine (seemed like they completely forgot about it). By this time, my mom was kind of pissed but I was ok with it since I was just happy about being off from school and living as a normal human and not a zombie. However, one of the waitresses came by and apologized for the poutine taking so long and even offered to give us a freebie to make up for it. I was honestly satisfied just with the apology; it was extremely professional of the staff to apologize to us and offer us something in return for the inconvienience. What I can say is that this place clearly knows how to do business and actually cares about what its customers think. Something like a soda isn't worth much in terms of actual cost but it really does mean a lot to the customer when the shop that commits a minor mistake is willing to own up to it and even go to the extent to make up for it.  Well, I might not like fried fish that much, but from my parent's verdicts, the food is super good. From my verdict, the service and professionalism of the staff here is absolutely fantastic. Even if I personally might not return for more fish and chips, I will definitely remember how great the staff is here. And for that, I'll be sure to recommend it to my friends who do enjoy fried foods."}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips. I only ever have the halibut and their fish is excellent. Isn't expensive- $10.95 for one order of halibut and chips. Been coming here for almost 10 years because I haven't found a better fish and chips place. Nothing has changed about the atmosphere...could use some updating but it's all part of the charm. Gets really busy on fridays so don't expect to be in and out in less than 30 mins."}
{"text":"This is where we come when we are in mood for some fish and chips, it is a small family owned restaurant, just like most fish and chip places, what sets them apart is their good customer service, fresh fish, LLBO, and pretty quick service.  Tip: order your fish well done and fries as well, otherwise I found the batter to be clammy inside and fries taste like there not done all the way.  My usual order: Halibut and chips, or just a halibut and a order of shrimps and few.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Such a great place. Im a big fish and chip fan, and these guys know how to do it right. The batter makes all the difference, and every time I show up theres a big line. Speaks for itself.   Frequent regularly and highly recommend. A real mom and pop establishment and thats what makes it authentic.   Great location and plenty of parking as well. Ive had friends drive from Downtown to eat here!"}
{"text":"It's the kind of place you'd expect to find in the land where they have the queen on their money.  Very casual little place in a non-descript strip mall. Service is super quick and prices are cheap. It's a good portion size. Fish isn't all that heavy so you can eat that and then pick away at your fries. Free Wi-Fi, too, so everybody can avoid that uncomfortable conversation with the people in your party.  I'm glad I found it. It's a nice little place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Are you looking to satisfy that nostalgic feeling you might get from some fish and chips? If so, this place definitely does it old school. It's a greasy spoon, mom and pop shop, seemingly owned by a Chinese couple. Nothing fancy here, just grease, batter, fish, and chips all bundled together in newsprint.  Food isn't superb, but it's not terrible. Service isn't out of the way awesome, nor is it downright bad. This restaurant takes the middle ground =)"}
{"text":"So far the best fish and chip place I have found in Mississauga. Very old school in presentation and flavours. You definitely know what you are going to be having when you walk in. My only comment would be to update the decor, the place doesn't have to be fancy. But there is something to be said for contemporary. Maybe it wouldn't be Homestyle then? Who knows?   But as to the food simply put, the best batter and best chips from my childhood memories."}
{"text":"Been a while since I been here, and fish & chips in general. Came here on Friday to pickup dinner and there was a lineup almost out the door and no signs of stopping. There are few seats inside but I usually take it home.  Order the family combo #1 with 3 fish and 2 fries, coleslaw, and 1 extra fish.  Came to $30.  The fish might be a bit smaller than other places I have been, but value is still pretty good I find.  Servers all seem very friendly there.  The food was all very good. I would say this is my go to place for fish, but there are a couple others in the area I have not tried yet. But definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced freshly fried fish fillet! A variety of fish choices that one can pick from. Good customer service and impressive heart \"home style\" ambience. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoy some traditional English cuisine. I ordered one cod, one haddock, a large coleslaw and a Coke today and ended paying 16 CAD. Extremely good value."}
{"text":"Went on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed! The fish that I had was really nice and flaky and light. I went when they had the lunch special on! Make sure you visit before 3:30 PM to take advantage of amazing deal so I'm good fish and chips! PS Lunch prices have now risen a touch since the picture someone uploaded. Basa is 4.75, haddock and cod see 5.75. Still pretty amazing for the price!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because of the Yelp reviews. I ordered the halibut and chips lunch special. It came to $6.50 tax included. Not bad...  The portion was good, the halibut was fresh but I wish the skin was crispier....the chips needed a bit of work as well. No flavour and zero salt.... Fries weren't the best. If the halibut had crispier skin that didn't sag off the piece of fish I would've given this place a higher rating. Great value however!  The food is made to order and the service is fast. I was in and out of the place in 5 mins. I would be back if I'm in the area for lunch. Check out their family meal deals!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place pretty much all my life; I had my first Fish&Chips here too.   Asides from that this place used to be owned by another family before the new owners took over. What I like most about this place is that the quality of food and service has stayed the same which really means a lot.   For the price they do give a pretty generous quantity and I feel satisfied after eating my meal, unlike most places where I feel hungry even after eating.   The food it's self is high in quality, the fish is generously battered and has a nice crunch to it."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great staff. I had the dinner special (Basa and chips) and it was fresh, delicious and not greasy like other places. The staff are very friendly too. I'll definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"One of the most under the radar fish and chips restaurants in Mississauga. It's has such an inviting environment and unlimited tartar sauce! Something that other places do not provide. They also have lunch specials. It's too bad I don't work near here otherwise i would go here every week!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and I can definitely say that it's my go-to for fish and chips. This is the best tasting fish and chips and also very affordable. I have tried many different restaurant's fish and chips and nothing compares to this. I always get the Haddock and chips for myself and basa and chips for my husband and 2 kids. We all love this place very much and it's a good thing we live right across from this plaza too."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this fish and chips has been around, but if you're looking for fresh, crunchy and inexpensive fish and chips at a Mom and Pop's place, then Homestyle Fish and Chips is the one for you! The lunch specials are way too cheap (see photo for lunch special pricing). I always get the haddock and chips, sometimes, depending on who's working, you can substitute the fries for coleslaw. Their fries are hit and miss (in terms of crunchiness level), but the batter and taste on the fish is always on point. They're open Monday to Saturday only, with the lunch special running on the Saturday as well. Beer is also cheap too. So the next time you're parents are having dim sum next door, you can excuse yourself and have fish and chips instead! ;)"}
{"text":"I was early for my massage appointment so I decided to try the Homestyle Fish & Chips next door. To no surprise it was jam packed and had lots of people waiting for take out food as well. It smelled amazing as soon as I walked in so I made sure to suck it up and wait.  Don't expect much from the dÃ©cor- this isn't a place to go to and expect something fancy- which is fine, it's just fish and chips after all! The staff were extremely friendly, attentive and even made menu suggestions (love when they do that without asking)  I went for the Halibut and chips. The fish was so tender and flavourful. It was cooked perfectly that even my fork can cut through it. The portions are large and extremely filling.  Of course halibut is a more expensive fish so it was expected to be a little bit more than the other fish selections but still worth every penny. They also give you tarter sauce to enjoy at the table when you dine in- finally a place that isn't stingy on the sauce.  I will certainly go back and enjoy some delicious fish and chips in the future"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Mississauga - some of the best fish and chips I've had. Order at the counter and pick a seat! Your dinner will be brought to your table. Don't forget the gravy for your fries - it's AMAZING!"}
