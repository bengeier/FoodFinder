{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!  The cesar salad was good & pasta dishes delicious.  The food was hot & the service was great!  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We go here a lot. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that i feel there is always room for improvement. There are many Italian restaurants in the area but this is by far the best.  I have had many dishes and they have all been very good. My kids even like the cheese ravioli. Cute small location"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 25 anniversary! We wanted to celebrate at Arrivederci. I had the Halibat, It came with artichock on it. WOW! So good. 
The atmosphere was perfect for us too.
Thanks you guys it was a night to remember!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Every time I'm in Scottsdale I always make it a point to eat at Arrivederci. My absolute favorite is the cannelloni di carne. It's heavenly! The service is definitely as good as the food."}
{"text":"We dined here two nights ago for the first time (thank you, Groupon!) and had no expectations.  I loved that their happy hour offers all their wines sold by the glass for $5.00 which is a great way to try something different.  The service was great, staff was friendly, the bread was to die for, and the food was fabuous!   We will definitely be back as we have plans to eat our way through the menu and try everything!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner on a Friday evening.  It was pretty busy but then again it was Friday evening and coupled with the GroupOn fervor it does brings people in.  They do have a Happy Hour from 5 to 7 and live music certain days of the week, but there is separate section devoted to the Happy Hour crowd.

We ordered the Melenzana Arrivederci (Rolled Eggplant filled with spinach & four cheese, served with tomato sauce and pasta).  The eggplant was ok but lacked flavor and the pasta was very inferior with the tomato sauce that was meh....  Also at $16, I would expect alot better.  We also ordered the Penne Alla Pepe e Nero, which was Penne in a lemon black pepper cream sauce with sausage, chicken and eggplant.  Pretty big portion but at $18 it was a fair price.  However, the sauce lacked a fresh lemon flavor and seemed more like a mustard in it for some reason or might have been overpowered with the pepper.  I understand all the pasta and sauce is made in house but the quality seemed like out of a box.

For dessert we ordered the cheese cake which was nothing great to write about either.

Giving it two starts because the service was good and so was our server, otherwise it deserves only a single star.  

Even with a GroupOn, there are many good choices around for good Italian Food and will not return."}
{"text":"My veal scaloppine was terrible, like tough shoe leather and over salted. The tiramisu dessert was good, but could not make up for the horrible veal scaloppine."}
{"text":"The wine was okay, food was decent, but the service was blah! The waiter treated us like we didn't belong. I've in place more upscale than this and didn't receive such poor treatment."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. That's what got this place 2 stars. The menu is overpriced, especially for the size of the portions. My husband and I were shocked by how small his $20 veal dish was. I had the eggplant which was three small pieces of eggplant rolled up with cheese. If you're going to charge too much, at least appease us by including a salad. My husband practically left there hungry! The service was slow, and we were squeezed into this tiny table between two other couples. 

Dessert was tasty, but again, overpriced. We had the pistachio tartufo, which was technically half of a tartufo. 

I was completely turned off by the feeling of getting ripped off. They make a tasty meal, that's all I'll give them. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience! The ambience was beautiful... we sat in the tasting room and had some cabernet, rochelle was our server and she was amazing! she sat us right away and was very attentive. we like that they put cucumber in the water! Delish! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 1 star for customer service only as I never got to eat there. I had a Groupon to redeem which expired on 2/27. This Groupon clearly said \"reservations required\". I had a friend coming from out of town and we decided we would use the Groupon on the way to the airport on 2/27 (the last day of groupon). On 2/24, I went to their website and made reservations for 3 at 5:30 PM (they use the open table system). I received confirmation and another confirmation/reminder the day before. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told that there were no reservations allowed. I explained that I had made it  3 days prior and had confirmation, the man at the desk refused to honor it and said that it should never have been allowed because they don't allow reservations on the last 3 days of a groupon (but..groupon said \"reservation required\"). He told me I had to wait over an hour for a table and I explained that we were heading to the airport and could not wait that long. I felt that his attitude was very rude. When I got home and looked at my email I saw that my reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant at 5:26, 4 minutes before the time of the reservation.  I will never go back to that restaurant."}

{"text":"This looked like a nice place to celebrate my wife's birthday, as she enjoys Italian meals, so we came here to celebrate my wife's birthday with the family (including two children)

Reservation was honored with no wait. Table setting was a bit odd, three wine glasses in a four table setting.  Not that I usually even care about the quality of silverware, but this looked like ones from a school cafeteria.

Bus staff brought water to the table and even put the water in a styrofoam cups for it youngster.  I had incorrectly assumed that almost all restaurants are in some way kid friendly, but this one isn't.  Other than the water, this place is not kid friendly in terms of drinks or food portions.

Started off with fried mozzarella, which was average, nothing fantastic but nothing bad.

Between all of us, we ordered 4 full dishes - lobster ravioli, meatballs all Franco, chicken arrabiata and a cheese ravioli.

Lobster ravioli and meatball dishes were good, with a portion size that matched it's price (well, lobster rav was a special so that jacked up the price).  

The cheese ravioli was a disappointment, with just 5-6 raviolis that were easily forgettable. 

The chicken arrabiata was an abomination!  The portion was small, the chicken rubbery, the sauce more like plain tomato sauce, and rice that was pathetic.  In reading other reviews of this place now, it seems that they do some dishes well but the chicken (and probably anything paired with rice) is an after thought. 

The food took over 45 minutes to get served, and a request for a second serving of bread did not come (it technically did come but we had already received our dinners at that point)

I went home still a bit hungry.

Overall, a poor value and with the consistency of food quality missing, we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Groupon got us in; great food and service will bring us back.

We started with the Caprese Rustica.  I found the roasted peppers to be a bit overwhelming, BUT... the mozzarella was -by far- the best I've had in a looooong time.  You know how most mozzarella (except, amazingly, the cheap 'string cheese' kind) is absolutely flavorless?  Even when advertised as 'fresh' or 'bufala'?  Well, the mozza here was wonderful - once you separated it from the peppers, it was simply delicious.  

The boyfriend had some kind of cannelloni with beef in a white wine tomato sauce.  The sauce was incredible... extremely well balanced, you could taste the wine and the tomato.  Just lovely.  When asked, he said his food was 'really quite good'. (Coming from him, that's a 4-star review.  He's not a foodie.)

I had ravioli with portobello mushrooms in a brown sauce.  If you're a 'shroom fan, you'll love the dish.  The ravioli were large and soft, the filling was super tasty and the sauce was awesome.  I had to order more bread to sop it up, it was so yummy.

Service was very good - our waiter was attentive, but not obnoxious, and we were able to enjoy a leisurely meal even on a busy Saturday night.  

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eating dinner with the wife and this place has a wonderful atmosphere for a romantic dinner. It's quite and the servers are quick and know the menu. Food is amazing and a must go place for Italian food."}
{"text":"The \"specials\" are always the same.  However, we have never had a meal that we were disappointed with.  The waiter always forgets beverages that are non alcoholic, but he is on top of it when it comes to selling wine. I only know because I was pregnant and he would forget my drinks. Lamb shank is very good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Arrivederci for an \" Italian Food Fix\"  Saturday night.Had the Antipasto appetizer and the Eggplant entr√©e. Both were great . Very reasonable for the atmosphere. We stayed for an after dinner drink and enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"We just came back from a wonderful evening at Arrivederci!!  We were looking for a non-hotel, local restaurant and we found the perfect place. The food was good, the wine was good and the service was excellent.  The owner and staff went well beyond what would normally be expected.  When we couldn't get a cab or car to come pick us up and take us back to our hotel, they drove us back.  Amazing!!  They were so lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed ending our evening with stories of their families and their passion for Italian cuisine.  No wonder their restaurant is a success!!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. Had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived there were probably 25 plus people with reservations who had NOT been seated. Why have reservations if you do not honor them? Waited at least 30 minutes and decided to leave since service would probably be awful as well. Do not recommend unless you 
Ike waiting outside in a parking lot."}
{"text":"Found through Groupon and thought we'd give it a try. So glad we did. Started with the shrimp squares. Delicious! Had another shrimp appetizer with rice and a spicy red sauce. Too hot for the wife, but I loved it. Entree was something special, falling off the bone lamb on fettuccine. We shared it and it was plenty for both of us. Absolutely delicious! Service was terrific and we will be back."}
{"text":"This was a very great experience. The service was awesome! Ask for DannThe food was excellent. We would recommend it to any one looking for an quaint Italian restaurant this is the place."}
{"text":"LOVE Arriverderci! My husband & I were introduced to the restaurant by friends and we've been several times since. The food is always excellent (I get the chicken parm) and my husband has never been disappointed with an order. The dessert is delicious too! We either get the chocomisu (they don't call it tiramisu) ) or the pistachio/chocolate dessert. I want to try the hazelnut one too! 
The staff is so friendly and accommodating; they really make it a great experience. 
We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food - 5.0

A big disappointment.

I brought my wife and kids here knowing I had a Groupon for $40. It's Mother's Day. We hadn't eaten here before, so a Groupon is a great incentive to try something new. When we arrived it was less than half full at around 6pm. Atmosphere was ordinary, but it appeared that they were professional. Cloth napkins and table clothes and well dressed staff. We ordered our food, which included wine, and rang up at tab just over $100. The food was nothing to write home to mom about, but it wasn't terrible. The quality didn't match the prices, however we knew we had our Groupon, so it made it all palatable. That is until we tried to pay and explained we had a Groupon, but I let him know I would still be tipping on the pre-Groupon total. He frowned and said that they don't take Groupon's on holidays. Having used many Groupons prior at other places, I always check the Fine Print before going. The only restriction it showed was that it couldn't be used during happy hour or in conjunction with other coupons. I showed the waiter this and he still gave me the heisman pose. I asked to speak to the manager, thinking this must be a mistake, and to my great surprise, the manager held his ground stating this was Groupon's policy in the Fine Print. I showed him that it said nothing about \"holidays,\" and he too stood his ground. I decided to take the high ground and save myself and my family further embarrassment and paid the tab (still tipped the waiter well since it wasn't his fault, per se), and here I write. Long story short, what a hustle and great disappointment. Not a great way to get a return customer who racks up $100 tabs for pasta. I've never seen a manager who would choose not only a battle that was wrong, but knowing that we would never return. 

I do not suggest supporting this establishment. This is my first YELP writeup."}
{"text":"Omigosh! We had reservations and they have COMPLETELY ignored us. Even let another group ahead of us. The hostess is rude and condescending. I will never come here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.  We are still standing here 45 minutes after we should have been seated!"}
{"text":"I'm sure the food would have been good...had we been able to actually eat it. We made a 7:15 reservation on a Saturday night and arrived a few minutes early. We waited about 30 minutes in line to even speak to the hostess. After flipping through her paper scheduling system and running around trying to move the patrons along, she finally told us it would be another 30-45 minutes, best guess. My best guess is that it would have been well over an hour and we would have sat down around 9 pm for a 7:15 reservation. I will not reward incompetency and arrogance with another visit."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Dodd, atmosphere and food was very
Good and affordable. Would go again if we were
In town."}
{"text":"Is pretty nice place close to my house.i actually love vine menu there,you can choose whatever your soul want at this moment.I satisfied with a food,can't said that is something really special,but for a diner it's nice.The best thing at this place is  waiters.they are fast,friendly and ready to help.Tables are toooooo small,but it's not s lot of place at all,so it's alright"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such strong reviews- things were just okay. Bread was mediocre, as other reviewers have said, pesto was tasty but not fantastic. We had a caprese salad that was terrible, an arugula salad that came out first with more than 50% bad arugula (was quickly fixed, but STILL), and chicken parm was not great. Arrabiata sauce was great though, as were my kids' meatballs. And three stars instead of two for having whole wheat and gluten free pasta options. The server was SO nice, so I feel bad even writing anything negative, but need to be honest!"}
{"text":"OMG so good!! I got a to-go order tonight and it was great. They were rally friendly and the rigatoni was fantastic. I went there because I had a coupon, but I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for the past nine years and haven't had a bad experience yet. My father and and husband are addicted to the veal gorgonzola and ordered it the other night as usual. They raved about the tenderness of the meat and the richness of the cheese sauce. Unlike these gentlemen, I order something different every time we go. This time is was the gnocci with shrimp and argula---yum! The potato dumplings were sleek, plump, and velvety, peppered with plenty of shrimp in the sauce. I find the freshness of their seafood and the pastas pretty amazing. 

Of course the service tops it all off. Our lovely \"mustached\" waiter, who had obviously been doing his job well for many years, kept things humming and organized. We received a very warm greeting at the door as well to start things off on the right note as well. We love this place!"}
{"text":"As if there aren't enough restaurants and more specific, Italian restaurants, in Scottsdale. We decided to celebrate my birthday here this evening. It turned out that it was almost several evenings. Specifically made a reservation through open table for 6:45. We arrived at 6:42 and was greeted by \"Oh, well sorry it will be just a few minutes longer\" After 32 minutes of \"just a few more minutes and I'm sorries from the young hostess we were seated at 7:17 by the owner(?) and she reassured me that we would enjoy my birthday dinner. Well.. She was wrong. We had waited so long that my 17 y/o son chose not to eat since the hour was later and his diet. When the caprese salad showed up 21 minutes later it was edible at best. Finally the food arrived at 8:16. Starving was passed a long time ago and we paced our eating but still completed the veal limon in 9 minutes. The waiter offered dessert but we declined due to the hour. 
Not another apology was made for the wait or delay, not a comp of a meal, not a birthday offering. At 2 hours almost exactly to when we arrived we walked out dissatisfied by the food and the restaurant. And $81 dollars lighter. This is not the first time but probably the last time we will go to Arrivederci. Went in to celebrate my 55th bday and I think by the time we left I was about to celebrate my 56th. Arrivederci to Arrivederci."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice as we loved their Lobster Ravioli and Eggplant Sorrentino. However, last Sat, for a present Valentine dinner, we were very disappointed with our dinners. We had the Veal which was dry and not so tender while my chicken penne with pink sauce had very little slices of chicken and the sauce was quite diluted. Prices were even higher than what they were."}
{"text":"We have been to Arrivederci at this location 3 times.  Each time, the food was fresh, the service personable and professional, and the overall experience very positive.  We were nervous about going on Christmas Day, but the restaurant did a great job of serving everyone without making us feel rushed even though the restaurant had a steady stream of diners, including several large parties.

Loved, loved, loved the calamari in broth!  Savory, garlicky deliciousness.  The chicken and veal parmesan dishes were both flavorful and tender, but were served at room temperature rather than piping hot like we like.  The complimentary Limoncello/Sambuca was a lovely touch for a festive evening.  Our desserts were scrumptious: I had the pistachio gelato with Belgian chocolate, and my husband had the limoncello cheesecake.  Both plates were clean even though we were both full from our meals, including the airy rolls and pesto oil dip."}
{"text":"This is very authenic Italian and one of my favorites. The waitstaff are friendly and attentive, but to be honest it is all about the superb food. I reccomend the stuffed eggplant and the linguine al fredo w/ chicken. The wonderful rolls with homemade pesto is pure heaven."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Phoenix!! This place is a hidden gem tucked away in Ahwatukee. Once you eat there you will tell everyone you know to go there too."}
{"text":"Average.  Been here numerous times over the years and the past couple of times have been so so.  Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"loved it !!  The mushroom appetizer is great!  The service good (Kelly) and the live music was very impressive.  What a great place to have a glass of wine and relax. Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We loved the food and dining experience!!  The atmosphere made us feel like we were in Italy!  We were on vacation, someone recommended we eat here, and we are so glad we took there advice!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Forget the overhyded North Italia, and enjoy the best italian food in all of Scottsdale at Arrivederci.  This restaurtant is a gem.  Great food, outstanding service and reasonable prices.  It doesn't get any better for Italian dishes than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gnocchi alla vodka is *muah* molte bene great service they brought my boyfriend the wrong meal but were happy to bring the right one out. Cannoli was so sweet and yum tuaca liquore was so smooth. A definate successful dinner."}
{"text":"If you want to sit at the bar and have some drinks while watching live music, this place will not disappoint. It's cute, quaint and their bar service is decent. Only at the bar though! I've had dinner here (or tried to), a handful of times now in the bar area, and the one thing that is consistent is the slow service. The most recent time was a week or ten days ago - 10/18/14. We stopped in at Arrivederci and the bar side of the restaurant was quiet. There was one four-top, one two-top and two separate individual people at the bar. We just wanted to have a glass of wine and decide on where to head for dinner. The bartender seemed to be buried, although we didn't understand why considering there were only 8 or so people in the entire bar area. It was ALL he could do to take our drink order. We laughed about it when he arrived breathless at our table to see what we wanted. The four-top was right next to us and they had food delivered and were complaining about how long it took. Also, it took them three requests for water to actually get the water. Well, it smelled GOOD and we were hungry so we figured we weren't in a hurry, why not eat here? However, the bartender never came back. Once he asked us from across the bar if we wanted more wine then brought it over, set the wine down and went on his way, didn't ask us if we wanted menus or an appetizer or anything. We laughed it off and gave up, paid the tab by bringing our credit card to the bar and then went on our way."}
{"text":"OK. So I was asked by friends to give this place another try and I must admit I was very surprised. They extended the restaurant! The dine in side is the same but the bar area is alot bigger and there's even a loungy feel to the bar side of the restaurant.

Their happy hour food and drinks are great! 

The crowd is a cool mix of young and old. All who seem to appreciate good drinks and great food.

Finally! A cool inexpensive place to go have drinks and food wih friends! I am now a fan of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wanted to hit happy hour, but wasn't able to sit in the lounge area because my grandfather is big .... so we ate normal dinner.  I wished that they would have accomodated us on his size for happy hour prices.

The music was a bit loud even after we asked the server to turn it down a bit. I don't believe he actually did turn the music down at all.  

All dishes were nice but nothing over the top.

I'd like to try it again for happy hour, but I will not be going back for normal menu items.  A little costly and quality of food just was not matching up for me.  

There are many things on the menu to try though."}
{"text":"What a mistake! We had heard that this was a good neighborhood Italian restaurant so we tried it on Valentine's Day. Arrived 5 minutes prior to our 8pm reservation and waited outside in a line for 25 minutes. The hostess refused to check guests in, instead making them wait until you were allowed to wait in their tiny bar and lined up in order of the next party. After seated for 15 minutes I asked the hostess to send our server as no one including the water and bread server had stopped by. The waiter promptly came, took our order, brought drinks but still no water or bread. Five minutes later I was able to flag that server and get water, bread and pesto. Our salads came out 15 minutes later and then the wait intensified. The 4-top next to us warned us they had bee there 2 hours and still didn't have their meals. They finally told their server to cancel their orders which he acknowledged. As he stepped away, their food arrived only to be cold. Then the server brought their checks to which they refused to pay. His response, \"Sorry but these things happen\". Miraculously our meals appeared 25 minutes after our salads and 2 minutes prior to our planned departure. The food was warm at best but there wasn't anyway that we were going to send it back and stay overnight especially since they had one food runner. After finishing the mediocre eggplant rollup and chicken parm, we asked for the check. 15 minutes later it appeared and another 10 minutes was required to process the wrong check! So over two hours spent in a thoroughly overwhelmed restaurant with many guests experiencing the same lack of hospitality. No one received a table visit, apology or acknowledgment despite the owners chatting at the front for 20 minutes after the rush passed. Obviously they overbooked the restaurant and never saw fit to accommodate their guests by being up front, apologizing or even comping a drink or dessert. Instead they avoided their guests and subjected their staff to a hellish experience. just consider me one and done."}
{"text":"Ironic that one of the translations of \"arrivederci\" is \"goodbye\" because that's exactly what I'm going to do - kiss this place goodbye!  I want to like this place - I like the environment and Ahwatukee has a severe shortage of variety in restaurants.  But this was the second time we gave this place a chance and it was just as bad as the first.

Our first experience, the service was ridiculously slow.  The waiter got my order wrong and when he finally brought the right order it was cold and my husband was nearly done.

I was hoping for a different waiter this time around to get a more well-rounded experience but sadly that was not the case.  Service was still slow, and communication was severely lacking.  I had to ask for water twice; the second time another waiter overheard and said \"he didn't hear you, but I did - we're low on water glasses right now\" and proceeded to give us water in wine glasses.  Totally acceptable solution, but the original problem should have been provided to us by our waiter.

We never got the specials.  Didn't know they had any until we were midway through our food and overheard waiter #2 telling the table next to us.

The only thing good about the food we got was the fresh bread.  I ordered the tortelloni bolognese and my husband ordered the fettucine alfredo with mushrooms and chicken.  I don't eat mushrooms, but I like the flavor - and in my opinion, mushrooms (rich flavor) and alfredo (rich flavor) seem like an overwhelming pairing and my husband said it was a strange combination.  There was something wrong with my tortelloni bolognese.  How one messes that up, I have no idea.  The sauce was watery, and there was an odd aftertaste in a few bites that were reminiscent of cleaning solvent.  I barely ate half and didn't bother taking it to go.

The tables were squished together; it was a regular occurrence for the staff to bump into each other.  The manager seemed loud and overbearing.  When another table near us also had a subpar experience, he comped their meal but was incredibly brash and loud about doing so.  They left even more annoyed than we did.

They must be doing other things right because the restaurant was full - we clearly just have not been on the receiving end.  However, two chances is all I'm giving.

Arrivederci, Arrivederci."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return."}
{"text":"My wife and I were having a great 1st anniversary until we walked into this place and heard the guy at the front direct us to our table and condescendingly said, \"your special table is saved over here.\" I'm sorry we wanted to celebrate our anniversary here. Im sorry we reserved a table and typed in 1st wedding anniversary. At the end of our meal I wanted another drink and walked up to the waiter stand. After I ordered another drink and walked away I heard the same guy say, \"it continues on.\" I barely ordered anything. Me nor my wife did anything to warrant any negative attitudes. What business pushes away their customers? A business that doesn't want customers. You can tell by the crowd here that this is how they operate. Besides our waitress's friendliness we wouldn't come back and won't recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal last night. It was severed beautifully, wine was perfect temperature and complemented the food to a tee.  
The lasagna was memorable. I would be proud to serve it in my own home. Both my husband and I agreed it was the best we had ever eaten. 
Thank you to the friendly staff and owners, we will tell all we know about our lovely experience."}
{"text":"A must stop for our family from Chicago when visiting on Spring Break.  Great food and attentive wait staff.  The complimentary lemon-cello shots to finish of the meal are added bonus.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but the good places never do, right?  Highly recommend this place as it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We discovered Arrivederci several years ago while on vacation and have  continued to come back.  We have never been disappointed: The food is wonderful from the fresh baked rolls to start the meal (with a delicious pesto, olive oil dipping sauce) to our meal - tonight we had cioppino and a wonderful Vitello Gorgonzola; the service was excellent; we were too full for dessert but the ending limoncello was the icing on the cake; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So very happy to have found this restaurant. We have been looking for a wonderful restaurant where we can go for our special occasions and the long search is over! The food is outstanding! Haven't had such great Italian food since I lived in Rome. Ambiance is very nice. Service is excellent.   Great menu. Have never been disappointed with anything we have chosen. Only drawback is how loud it can get.  Overall still an A+."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have enjoyed their \"Salmone Mostarda\" as an appetizer. I've taken my parents from IL here... dad ordered the \"Rustica\" pizza. I chose the \"Rigatoni Alla Vodka\"... plenty of leftovers to enjoy later. Its scrumptuous. I have also ordered the \"Ravioli Caprese.\" The service has always been top rate. Mmmmm! I would jump at the chance to go again. I had clients first turn me on to Arrivederci at T-bird & Scottsdale Rd. in north Scottsdale. The waiter had an Italian accent and the pasta was freshly made. We indulged in dessert and it was heavenly... can't remember what it was but mmmmm! Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Mamma Mia!  Arrivederci just keeps on getting better.  I have always loved the food and wine, and have gone back many times for a pleasant evening.  But now, Max and Joseph have added the crowning touch; the brand new large bar and lounge makes this place feel like home.  There is a giant screen on the far wall where we all can watch a movie or sporting event.  There are couches and easy chairs as well as the traditional bar stools and high tops.  On Fridays and Saturdays they have added live music.  Happy hour prices til 7pm, super friendly staff and owners, great food and a terrific selection of reasonably priced wines makes this my favorite Italian trattoria."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned Italian joint that serves scratch made pasta, a real Ferrari for a doormat and a cozy atmosphere to enjoy dinner with friends. My first time there at a friends invite and gladly accepted. 

Early we were that evening and exterior wise the size is deceiving but inside you'll find nice tabletops as well as an area segregated by glass partition doors if you want a more intimate party theme. We opted to go far in the back for the privacy and indeed our laughter and banter could barely be muffled regardless of how hard we tried. But good eats with long lost friends made us immune to the glares.

My choice of the seafood risotto was divine, creamy and plenty of mussels shrimps and squid & a nice touch of saffron. The arborio rice arrived with a nice pleasant al dente bite and more than enough to take home for next day's leftovers. 

But the star was my friends lobster ravioli special of the night something I still regret not choosing! The sauce was divine with just the right kiss of some brandy to kick start the creme. You could have easily consumed another basket of bread to sop up those umptious flavors!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place, knowing how good the food is since I had been here before!  $20 for $40 worth of food.  The groupon stated you must call in advance by phone (not on open table) and make a resv to use the groupon.  It also said one groupon per table and there were 2 couples that went here that evening.  When I called the day before our dinner I was told by a man on the phone (sounded Italian...but then again, everyone at this place sounds Italian and I think they fake that accent, by the way!) there is no need for a resv for 4 at 6:30 PM...\"just come-a in-a (that's the Italian accent).\"  So that is what we did.  And WHEN we got there the place was pretty much packed!!  The first question out of the host's mouth, \"Ummm....do you-a have a reservation?\"  I nearly lost it.  However, after my 1.5 min rant about TRYING to make a resv in advance, they quickly seated us at a table for 4....in the crammed, wee corner of the place right by the front door and host station and in front of the line where servers pick up food.  But at least it was a table!

The server was friendly.  We had brought a dozen cupcakes to celebrate my friend's birthday and they stored them for us in the back since the table was the size of my hand.  We ordered a bottle of sangiovese....that came with a screw top cap (not corked) and was so so.  I had the penne pasta with chicken and vodka sauce.  Pretty good and HUGE portion (took most of it home).  Mid way through dinner my husband looked over his left shoulder and then pointed out the 3 inch cockroach crawling on the floor about 4 feet away from our tiny table!!  Ewwwwwwww.  I know every restaurant has cockroaches but it was gross.  We did not order dessert because we had the cupcakes and we couldn't stop thinking about the cockroach.  Server was kind enough to let us use BOTH groupons, even though it did state one per table."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiance's family for dinner and a little casual celebration.  The food was fantastic and the service was good.  The only down side is that the place is a bit noisy, and a little crowded.  People kept bumping into my chair as they passed, and while it's not overly loud, forget about holding a quiet private conversation.

I had one of their specials that day, a shrimp ravioli, which was exceptional, with nice sized pieces of shrimp cut up into the sauce.  The chef seems to really know what he's doing."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Great service. Came because of groupon. Definitely will be back. Tuesday evening dinner without the wait. Kelly was an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"There seems to be a difference in food preparation between weekdays and weekends with weekdays being of higher quality.  This doesn't make the weekends bad ... just not as good as the weekdays.  And, the weekdays haven't let me down in the last dozen visits.  
Their bolognese (meat sauce) is under-rated and I keep going back for just that.  The people I bring always seem to enjoy what they have.  
If you are looking for a quaint, middle-of-the-road priced neighborhood Italian place, you've found it."}
{"text":"First I am an Italian from Brooklyn New York and I have been to Italy several times so I know good Italian food and if you want very good authentic Italian food this is the place to go. I have had most things on the menu and all are very good. In fact this is my favorite place for me and my wife. I have recommended this place to several people and all have said the same thing: the food is spectacular and the service is impeccable! The best Italian food in the city."}
{"text":"These quaint little Italian restaurant located in Ahwatukee is a jewel. My wife and I have been there several times, and without exception, they treat us to a delicious dinner with magnificent service. The place does not look like much from outside, being located in a small commercial corner, but once inside, it is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. You will be transported to an Italian trattoria the minute you enter. 

The food is very Italian (I grew up in Italy), and prepared with great care. The waiters are friendly and respectful and they are quick to provide you with a glass of wine or whatever else your heart desires the minute you are seated. The linen table cloths and napkins add a touch of class to your night. The menu is varied and reasonably priced. The time it takes the kitchen to prepare your dinner is perfect--not too long and not too short--giving you enough time to visit and anticipate the delicious dishes headed in your direction. We have sampled multiple dishes there, and each one has been as wonderful as the previous one.

We recommend Arrivederci's to anyone desiring a lovely night out with exquisite food, good drinks and a delightful atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food & wine are good & happy hour is great, but, as nice as our waitress was, she brought our wine & appetizer, but our pizza never materialized."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never reviewed this one on Yelp.  I have only ever done it on Open Table.  Maybe I am being sub-consciously selfish because I don't ever want them to not have room for me when I wish to go. This is my \"go to\" neighborhood Italian restaurant.  My husband gave me 2 choices late yesterday and, of the 2, I chose this. We have been there regularly and they are always very accommodating. Last night we split the eggplant parmesan  appetizer - very flavorful and cut very thin. We each had some hearty minestrone soup followed by this \"melt in your mouth\" lamb osso bucco.  It has been on special before but I have always ignored it. While seating us, a plate for another table went by and it just looked so good, I had to break down and try it. I wish I had a way with words to describe how very tasty it was.  It was served with fettucini (which I believe they make their own pastas) in the osso bucco sauce.  I couldn't finish mine and asked to have it boxed.  We kept waiting and finally I had to ask the waiter where my left-overs went.  He went to check and they had accidentally trashed them but before he came back to tell me, the kitchen had already started on making me a whole dinner to take home. I didn't ask and I would not have asked - they just did it.  That is good management and caring about your customers. In the past, my husband has enjoyed their various fishes and I have always enjoyed their veal. Sauces are good; pasta is always cooked perfectly.  My favorite of all time though they only do on special occasions like Christmas Eve or Mother's Day, and then only if they can get the proper ingredients, is the diver scallops and shrimp in a champagne sauce over linquini. It was chancy for me to try as I do not generally like scallops unless they are fried, but these had a great sear and were cooked to perfection.  Do by all means try this place - just don't get in my way - LOL."}
{"text":"We went there while we were in Scottsdale on vacation.  It had 4 stars on Yelp so we thought this would be a good Italian restaurant.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  We had a reservation and yet we were seated at a cramped table for 2 in a corner.  

The waitress merely came to take our order.  We explained we had not been there before.  Instead of volunteering house specialties or explaining the menu she smiled still waiting for us to order.  It took several questions to determine a recommendation.

I ordered the recommended veal and my wife ordered the recommended eggplant Parmesan.  Surprisingly nothing came with the food.  The pasta on my plate was disappointing and bland.  The veal itself was paper thin and rather tasteless and tough.  The eggplant parmesan was good according to my wife but nothing special.

For a 4 star restaurant we expected better tasting food and far better service.

When it came time to pay, the waitress brought the bill and then disappeared for over twenty minutes.  Given how small the restaurant is, this was no easy feat and yet she buzzed by various tables purposely not looking our way.

The waitress seemed to be more outgoing with other tables, just not us.  It seemed pretty obvious this restaurant plays favorites and for some reason they did not take a shining to us from the very beginning.  Just so you know we are a normal looking couple who were dressed in dockers and polo shirts with no piercings or tattoos."}
{"text":"What a find!  We hadn't been there for years , but remembered we really liked it then.  Well, we are sorry we waited so long.  The food was outstanding, & we are picky foodies!  As we sat down we got a warm roll & a wonderful pesto with tomatoes.  One of the best bruschettas!  Caesar salad was a little different , but very plentiful & tasty. We were told veal is there specialty.   Everyone loved the veal marsala & veal parmesan, again a large portion.  This was a perfect birthday meal for my guests and me.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Gary O.
I took my wife to Arrivederci's for her birthday 4/15/2016. Ordered a bottle of wine. I had a chicken dish while my wife had the veal. While eating, my wife felt something in her mouth and pulled out a single strand of hair about 6 inches long with a piece of veal stuck to the end! It was disgusting and certainly gross. Needless to say that ended our meal. The restaurant did credit both our meals. If that wasn't bad enough though the restaurant seemed to put the brunt of this issue on the server which wasn't her fault. They surely threw her under the bus. No manager or anyone in charge came over to speak to us and/or apologize. Obviously, that is our last visit to Arrivederci's!! Be careful eating there."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Arrivederci Trattoria.  I have driven by this restaurant many times but  have never stopped.  I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant several weeks ago and I am glad I did.

The service was great, and the restaurant had a very friendly atmosphere.

I started with the minestrone soup and for my main course I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka cream sauce.  My 9-year-old also loved the minestrone soup (he ate most of mine) and he really liked the spaghetti and meatballs.   My significant other ordered a salad and the tortellini (both of which he enjoyed).

For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake (I cannot remember what it was called) and it was so yummy. 

The restaurant also gives out complimentary homemade lemoncello (though tonight it was raspberry cello) which was pretty good.

It was a bit pricey but I will be returning to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get treated like family and the food is delicious. I really enjoy the lasagna and their meat sauce. Also the flourless Choc cake is amazing. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good Italian meal in ahwatukee."}
{"text":"A great place for happy hour or dinner. Friendly staff, good wine selection and everything on the menu is outstanding."}
{"text":"Came to Arrivederchi for a special birthday dinner.  The service was wonderful.  The waiter recommended the Cucumber Lime Martini and it was fantastic.  We had the jumbo cheese ravioli special with shrimp and lobster sauce and my husband was licking the plate clean.  Then they surprised us with a special chocolate torte and some Limoncello as a birthday treat.  I am so glad we came her for my birthday, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Under any other circumstance, this would be a five-star rating. I have dined here several times and never been disappointed, until Christmas eve.

The management packed as many extra tables in as humanly possible and grossly overbooked the  venue.

We waited forty minutes past our reservation time, were given a terrible table, and served bad meals; my sauteed calamari came complete with shrimp shells. Everyone at our table got cold or lukewarm food.

I will go back, but never on a special occasion"}
{"text":"Hopelessly overbooked last night. Foyer was crammed with frustrated people with reservations. We waited until 7:15 on a 6:30 reservation. Food was poor - obviously kitchen was overwhelmed. No apologies till we were leaving. Too little too late! Never again."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant choice for my birthday! The service, food, and wine was fantastic. My group of four ordered four different meals and everyone loved it! We have been to many different Italian restaurants living in Chicago. The menu options are traditional Italian dishes with typical prices and good portion size. The staff was all very friendly and made you feel more than welcome. The Limoncello and Tiramisu were delicious for dessert. If you have not been, check it out!"}
{"text":"Yearning for a traditional Italian fare... Look no further! We split the seafood risotto and the portabella mushroom salad! More than plenty for two, flavor bursting with every bite! Topped off with tiramisu and it was homemade, plus a shot of limoncello on the house! I can't say anymore except what are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner to use a groupon I had purchased, meh, ok meal. The mall area were the restaurant is looks old and unappealing, it's next to a wig shop(gross) and the inside looks more like a pizzeria than a restaurant. The service was ok, servers need some customer service training, since he would stop at our table for two seconds and run away like he was running for his life! Food was not worth the prices, way better at bucca or Olive Garden which is sad because the owner is italian, will not go back"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing. Hadn't been there in couple of years so don't know if it's trending down. Pasta was over cooked as was the calamari. I guess should have complained and returned it, but with others there, just didn't eat it. Three large shrimps and two large scallops for $26, U decide. Wine was good tho."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  The staff is professional, friendly and efficient.  We have always had great service.  The food is really very, very good.  It is fresh, and prepared with pride.  The atmosphere is lively and can be a little noisy. It is not a large restaurant and so when full can feel a little tight, but it all adds to the fun.   
We visit this place often and it has become a family favorite.  They have a great wine list!  We love this little restaurant and their staff.  
Cliff and Cathi"}
{"text":"I just had my daughter's baptism catered from Arrivederci and I can't say enough good things about it!  The food was excellent!  I served it to a group of Italians and they loved it!  I called a few days before the baptism and although they open late on Sunday, they opened early for to cook my food.  I ordered shrimp ravioli and chicken florentine.  Although the chicken florentine is not on their menu, they accommodated my request.  The food was delivered on time and was warm.  I gave them my budget and they worked with me to meet it.  We had so much food but little leftover because it was so delicious.  The owner called me the next day to ask how everything went.  That was a great personal touch.  I highly recommend for catering and dinner."}
{"text":"Nice & cozy place. On the expensive side but the food is great depending on what you pick. The chef's special had a dish with some kind of potato dumplings with cheese. Although plain sounding, that was just mouth watering. We also got a seafood pasta with clams, prawns & calamari in it. This was way too fishy smelling. Felt like a seagull eating raw fish. I am a major seafood fan, but this did not do it for me. 

We'll go there again for special occassions."}
{"text":"The concierge described this restaurant as \"the best Italian food ever.\" Now, having been there, I would have to describe the concierge as the Master of Understatement. The food was very good, but our server, Natalie, put the evening over the top. The evening couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"Even though its right around the corner, this is the first time I've been here and I would definitely come back.
I like the cozy bar in the front which had a city feel to it - reminded me of places in San Francisco.  
The food was outstanding Tuscan style and they actually have Calamari that is steamed not fried.  I had the Chicken with mushrooms in a light broth and my dining companion had the Salmon, we both cleaned our plates. Very good service."}
{"text":"Excellent. The staff are professional & worked together as a team taking care of our courses seamlessly. 
We make it a point to dine here whenever in the Scottsdale area. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were 6 people for dinner. We had reservations for 6:30. Our meal was finally served at 8:00. The service was excellent and the food was good. The waitress apologized for the delay but it was a long wait. Somewhat noisy.
So as much as we enjoyed the food, 90 minutes was an inordinate amount of time to wait."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner at Arrivederci's the other night. The overall vibe is more of a quiet date destination. We got there right as they opened so it was nice and quiet. I was surprised that they were not ready for customers. We did not receive bread for over a half hour and the first basket they brought was actually burnt. 

We had the grilled eggplant as an appetizer and it was delicious. My son had the Pollo Parmigiano and of course, as a teenage it devoured it :-) I ordered one of the chefs special that include Italian sausage and chicken in a penne pasta. It was good but a little salty. 

Overall I would return but would ensure I did so at a later time in the evening."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was ok at best. I had the eggplant parmesan, which was delicious. I highly recommended it. But overall the service was okay. I am all for going to local places, but they need at least try and give good service."}
{"text":"Went last night and had a wonderful time.  The food is very fresh.  I had the gnocchi, my son had the ravioli.  I would characterize it as a very good northern italian style neighborhood place.  Wines were reasonbly priced, and the service was efficient and very friendly.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Great service. I'd definitely  go back. Be sure and make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews but felt it necessary to relate our dinner experience part night. We showed up for a 7 pm reservation but were not seated until 7:35. No explanation for that. From the time we ordered our food, which was delicious, it took an hour until it arrived. That's unacceptable. Giovanni our waiter did the best he could but we think they simply overbooked and were slammed. Too bad they can't manage their customers better. The experience overshadowed the wonderful food."}
{"text":"I love Arrivederci. I feel conflicted every time I'm in this shopping outlet because it's packed with two great Italian restaurants, but Arrivederci has hands-down the best eggplant you can eat in Arizona. (I've been to a lot of Italian joints.)

The service is always great, the food is always hot and delicious and the deserts are worth the guilt that come with them. Definitely check this spot out! Naomi Garnice gives it five stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for happy hour as well as for full-on dinner.  This is consistently delicious Italian food - some of the best in Ahwatukee.  I love just sitting at the bar, drinking wine (great wine list) and eating appetizers (try the melanzana and the calamari)."}
{"text":"Great Italian dining experience. Authentic decor inside with Italian male waiters, just like NYC similar places. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, \"Wow!\". The food is AMAZING!  The service there is also just as amazing. This is probably some of the best Italian food I've had in the Valley."}
{"text":"We have eaten here quite a few times, but this particular night was not a good one.  We ordered Vitello Piccata Con Carciofi, which is veal scalopinni, artichoke hearts and capers in a wine lemon sauce.  We changed up the order to no vegetables; instead, we wanted spaghetti with the same wine lemon sauce.  We specifically said we both wanted the same thing.  When our order was brought to our table, by the same person who took the order, she only brought us one plate.  We told her we both ordered the same thing. She wanted to know if we wanted to put in another order.  We declined because we wanted to dine at the same time.  Needless to say, it was a very disappointing dining experience for us, as we were looking forward to spending quality time together with a relaxing meal.  Unfortunately, neither one of us were satisfied.  I doubt we will return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I must have passed this place a thousand times and admired the cool sports cars outside of it.  Finally decided to try it for lunch.  There were two couples there who were having an early lunch just like us.  The place was nicely decorated and had white tablecloths on every table.  Very nice.  We were served basil pesto in a deep, green, extra-virgin olive oil that was a complement to the bread we were served.  The pesto dip was really delicious although I thought it needed a few grains of salt to balance it out.  The bread roll was puffy and crunchy on the outside with a nice texture inside.  I like bread with holes and this one had them.  We ordered chicken parm  and hubby had a chicken cutlet with a slice of eggplant on it.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. Each came with penne with a tasty tomato sauce.  The penne were perfectly cooked al dente.  The sauce was really good-- as I like it not too sweet and not too acidic.  Nicely balanced sauce, almost NY style.  We didn't have dessert but viewed the dessert menu for future reference.  I saw that they have a ricotta/mascarpone cheese cake on the menu that I will have next time around .  
What surprised me was that the two lunches were $12.95 each and the total bill was totaled as $42 and change.  What?  That is quite a math error(?) --almost $16 over.  Usually errors are a dollar here or there but not $16.  The waitress could not explain the error but corrected the bill using a calculator.  We did not under tip her as a result of this and this will not deter us from enjoying their delicious food once again.  We prefer to believe that it was an accidental error."}
{"text":"I've only tried one entree here because I am afraid to try the others.  There eggplant parmesan is to die for!  Although my food is great, the wait staff is a little pushy (may be the Italian in them).  No expression on there faces or warm smiles.  I've been here only a handful of times but crave there eggplant quite often.  It is a very intimate setting and a great date night!  I remember once asking for more bread with our meal and the bread took almost 20 minutes, but it did taste like it came out of the oven.  The portions are very generous and I always have left overs.  I would recommend this place for good Italian food but if your wanting a warm friendly wait staff I would check out the olive garden, where you are family!"}
{"text":"I am a fond follower and now employee of Arrivederci! 

We are expanding in the next few weeks, look for the wine bar to open!  

Also, I heard we are reopening for lunch, so all of you that want to imbibe....stop on by!  I will be happy to serve you!  

Please call us if you want to have dinner late, and we will keep the doors open just for you!"}
{"text":"We were skeptical about this restaurant because it was easy to get reservation the day before and we were using a Groupon.  Well we were pleasantly surprised.  It is an authentic Italian restaurant with many Italian staff members.  My husband had a dish with sausage and peppers and said it had great flavor and just enough spice.  I had pork loin in a gorgonzola cheese sauce with gnocchi.   The flavor was nice but it looked terribly bland; all white on the plate.  A little dusting on the dish of some color would be appropriate.  Our one criticism is that the water was served in a plastic tumbler.  Seriously?  This is a white table cloth restaurant with nice wine glasses and fairly high end menu.   The water also tasted awful like it had not been filtered.  All and all a good experience but the water glasses need to go and get a filter people."}
{"text":"Food was exceptionally good - that's the reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star.

However.  Big however here folks...

Jamie, the manager, who was our waiter, was off the charts ridiculous. He was dropping f-bombs and swearing like a sailor assuming we would be warm to that?!?!?  

He made us feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable.

Also, I would go as far to say that given the dilation of his pupils - he was either on coke or crank. 

The last straw was when he insulted my wife and I as he was giving us our check. Wtf ?!?!

Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant. 

Had the chicken parm and it was very good! Food quality and quantity were above average. 

The only complaint I have was the espresso was cold. Other than that it was tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Arrivederci yesterday, after being there for dinner on several other occasions. We had a superb lunch, with truly outstanding service from Anna Maria. 

Before we ordered, she brought hot, crusty rolls to the table with pesto dipping sauce. That was just amazing to stir up our appetites! 

We had a crisp, extra cool Caesar salad for starters that was just perfect. We followed that with the Melanzana Sorrentina appetizer, which is grilled eggplant with mozzarella and a delicate tomato sauce. Our entree was a fantastic veal scallopini with artichoke hearts and capers in another sublime sauce. 

Arrivederci in North Scottsdale is a gem! We recommend it highly for lunch or dinner. If you love Italian food, you'll really love this little place!"}
{"text":"We went for our first time to Arrivederchi Ahwautukee recently on a weeknight, thinking it would not be crowded, but we were dead wrong! Parking was easy, but when we walked in the door, the place was hopping. Every table was taken, and all the staff were working fast like a well-oiled, but super-friendly, machine. (Surely, you have met at least one other friendly machine in your life.) 

We actually had a short wait for a table. Water and wine service were prompt and jovial. Their menu is loaded with nice touches on classic Italian dishes. 

It has been a while since we were there, so my wife and I both are a bit hazy on what we ordered. But we remember clearly that we were highly impressed by their kitchen, their staff, their location, and their charming Italian decor. 

Now we need to go back and refresh our memories. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had a groupon, so we had dinner there. Ambience is quaint, dark, candlelit and intimate.
I had the chicken mustardo and the hubby had chicken arribatta. Mine was absolutely delicious and very flavorful. Pasta was cooked to perfection, al dente. 

Hubby's was ok, the sauce for the chicken was spicy as described, but extremely bland. Kind of like plain tomato sauce with red pepper in it and that's it.

Had a cannoli for dessert and it was very good.There was filling throughout the cookie shell. I really hate when you get a cannoli and they stuff it from both ends but the center is hollow, not this one, it was completely stuffed and really really good.

Service was very good as well.We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We go here frequently, most recently for my birthday. They accommodated our large party. Our food was delicious as always. Outside of the delicious food; their service is well above any other restaurant. They are always warm and welcoming whenever we visit. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good authentic italian food, fair prices, excellent wait staff. It's a small, intimate restaurant with limited seating. Because of that, a busy night can sometimes overwhelm the otherwise friendly hostess. Reservations are recommended but are no guarantee that she will remember to save you a table..."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. My food & my boyfriend's food was really delicious, but unfortunately his mom's chicken was raw (ew) and when I brought it to their attention they were not at all apologetic, the lady literally just said, \"ok\" and carried on as if the chicken was not raw! which was so disappointing because otherwise, the rest of the food was really delicious and the place was so small & charming. I would give them another try. I would be wary of ordering chicken there, but otherwise, I would go again."}
{"text":"just got home from this place..not bad but not great either..wife and I ordered the clam and mussels app and it cost like $11.00..No joke we got 12 total clams and mussels..very disappointed about that..wife got the Lobster Ravioli special..mostly cheese in them..hardly tasted any lobster what so ever..another disappointment..i got the veal gorgonzola,,not bad at all..veal was a little over cooked but eatable..I will say the waitress was very nice and knew her stuff..she got her 20% tip..thank goodness for the Groupon I had,,the meal was not worth the total price..We will not be returning there..Sorry"}
{"text":"We live right up the street from Arrivederci and while it is way too nice to eat there too often, it is a treat every time we do. 

The staff is great. Real old school nice service. 

Warning, like any good Italian restaurant ... They love to get you liquored up :) 

Luckily we can walk home from here and so we do indulge from time to time in a wine fest here. 

The food is great. All the sauces are fresh and homemade. The eggplant rollatini is delicious ... The gnocchi is the best I've had and you have to love the drinks. 

Great place to take a date or just pop in for a nice dinner on a Tuesday. You will be welcomed with a smile and always leave with one on your face. 

4 out of 5. It really is closer to 4.5 out of five.

{"text":"Cute little restaurant with an authentic feel. I had the chicken parm and it was very tasty. Everyone at the table liked their meals and the ladies said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had. Good service and waiter. I will go back."}
{"text":"My family had our Mother's Day dinner at Arrivederci's tonight and there were 11 of us. The place was packed and the service was terrible. After the long wait, our meals were served and the waiter never came back to the table for the rest of the night. Some of us liked our meals and others did not. The chicken parmigiana was just a slab of chicken without breading topped with a slice of cheese.  Did the chef just get lazy?  It was tasteless and unappetizing. 

When the check came (over $400.00) the tip of over 20 percent was added to the total after tax. Also they charged us twice for a meal that cost $29. They tried to rip us off and they were unpleasant when we asked them to correct the mistake.  We sat there for another 20 minutes while they recalculated the check. Go eat somewhere else!  There are plenty of better Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I've now been here three times and have to say this is a great choice if you're looking for a fairly simple but tasty Italian restaurant.

The owner is incredibly friendly and service is very quick, since, when they're busy, they have a team wait on you.  One person brings the bread, another takes your order, and another fills up waters.  You may not see your actual server very often, but that allows you to focus on the food.

The food, for the most part, is great.  I love the Chicken with Mushrooms.  Portions aren't too big, especially considering what you pay, but you likely won't be disappointed.  Just keep in mind the Calamari isn't fried, so if that's what you're expecting, steer clear.

One time we went, the hostess was fairly rude to my wife.  She seemed very busy, so it could have been that, but since we don't encounter rudeness at Scottsdale restaurants too often, I thought it was important to note.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We dined here several years ago and were pleased overall so we thought we would try it again.  We had an early reservation and were promptly seated.  The restaurant d√©cor is old, tired and bleak.  The chairs are some of the most uncomfortable I have sat in.  The wine prices were fair.  We received our entrees within five minutes of ordering.  Obviously the food is ready to go and quickly heated in a microwave.  My husband had an appetizer, which was very small and he said that it was fair.  Our son had the Fusilli Bolognese which he said was spicy but good.  I had the cannelloni.  The lukewarm pasta was gummy and dry which indicates it was sitting out too long.  The filling and sauce were terrible.  I could barely eat one of the three tubes.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal.  Service was very inconsistent and we had to ask for everything. We had three issues here that never should have happened in a restaurant like this:   server never asked how our meals were, empty plates were not removed in a timely fashion and the server reached his arm across the table in front of me to pick up the bill after I had signed the credit card receipt and stood there checking out what the amount of the tip was.  That rudeness really did it for us."}
{"text":"My mom recommended this restaurant which fit my husbands Italian Date Night theme perfectly.  We went early because our movie started at 6:45 and we wanted to eat prior.  The place is very inimate and cozy and was nearly empty at 5:30 on a Saturday night.  

Our waiter, who was also our host, was very attentive and friendly.  We were brought rolls that appear to be homemade and taste to be too.  They come with a bowl of pesto that is fantastic!  I had the Canneloni with beef filling in a red cream sauce and my husband had the Gnocci  We asked if we could have the gnocci with meatballs and red sauce instead of the menu choices of chicken, shrimp or salmon.  We think the meatballs and red sauce should be added to the menu as a selection.  It was superb!  Fresh and garlicky.  My canneloni were very rich and the melty, crusty cheese on top really made the dish.  We did not get salads prior to our meal nor dessert afterwards.  Our orders were plentiful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just dined at this restaurant for the first time.....EXCELLENT! Great food, great service, very pleasant atmosphere. We will be dining there again!"}
{"text":"The minute we walked in the door the host was aloof  and unwelcoming. Sat us at a table when I asked to move he informed me it would take to long to clean the table. 5 minutes later a group came in and he greeted them with hugs and gave them the table I had requested. My dinner a signature dish was burned. All and all not a good experience. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The place has a quaint little vibe of an Italian restaurant that I loved! Came on a Friday night around 8 and they had live music (though opposite from the dining area so I didn't actually see). Service was good for a busy night. I had the mussels and clams as an appetizer, which were so great!! ***Only giving 3 stars because the Shrimp and Lobster ravioli special I had was made with imitation lobster, and the shrimp was chopped up shrimp bits which also could have been imitation... not what I was expecting at all. I was disappointed. Everything else was good enough that I'd probably give it another try, I'll just be sure to avoid that next time!"}
{"text":"I have dined here several times through the years and have always enjoyed my meal. This was not the case tonight, what I wanted on the the menu, I was told they were out of cannelloni. I was there before 6pm on a Tuesday night. Out of cannelloni? 
I ordered the ravioli which was delicious but it was lukewarm, disappointed to say the least. The restaurant was full for a Tuesday night, there is a loyal clientele that goes there, I usually enjoy my meal but not so much tonight."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but good. Service was a little slow, but atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"The sorbetto was delicious !! So fresh, I love the small family run restaurant , the fusilli pasta with meatballs allay bolognese was so good! The gnocchi with arugula and shrimp was also very good. I loved the pesto dip sauce !"}
{"text":"Wish I would have know about this place sooner because it was top notch. It is very Italian right down to the accents on the waiter who appeared to be right off the boat from Venice or Rome. Of course, the bread and parmesan cheese guy was from Mexico, but the food was great and the prices were about $15 per dish. My chicken parm was up there in top echelon of this category served with penne. It was a very large cutlet. My dad had a mushroom and chicken dish off the specials menu that was doused with mushrooms and sherry cream sauce. Outstanding. The bread was a classy operation also as it was served with tongs one at a time and you can request butter. Of course, you must try the famous Chocomasu, which all you need is a picture to look at to start drooling. Good balance of flavors in the desert which was eight bucks. If you can't make it to Italy, go here for a great meal."}
{"text":"We had dinner there on a slow Monday night. We felt the young lady who was a our server did a very nice job taking care of us. There was bread and water served very promptly. She checked on our readiness to order a few times and was very attentive. The food and service was worthy of a four star rating. All four meals served looked very appealing and tasted wonderful!!! The atmosphere and decor is where Arrivederci needs some TLC. The doors to the restaurant and bar areas were confusing (due to the tinted windows). They had past award frames sitting in the window (and in our opinion, should have been hung somewhere inside). The lighting was pretty dark and there was a big metal cabinet with some boxes/supplies right by our table. The pathway back to the bathrooms had supplies and other materials along it and made that area of the restaurant look subpar and junky. We would go back more for the food than the ambiance. I think if they cleaned things up and did more with the decor, I could easily rate this 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"The customer was absolutely terrible, the front of the house was poor and the server gave us truly bad customer service 1/10. Mary was our server. It was like pulling teeth to ask for chicken cutlets for our 3 yr old Son, and they charged us $7 for 3 of the tiniest chicken cutlets (it was really one cutlet split into smaller pieces) with no side for him. 

The beef carpaccio was awful. The beef was over cured, it was like eating salami, and they drenched the arugula with dressing. Worst carpaccio I have ever had.

Even The pesto for the bread was awful

The main entrees were ok, we had the eggplant rolled with ricotta and the parradella pasta with sausage. Not bad, but my entree was $21 and the quality of the food did not merit that.

Terrible dining experience, definitely will not go back"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place when we want to spoil ourselves.  The bread and pesto if phenomenal!  The lobster ravioli is divine.  And we love the lemoncello at the end with the yummy biscotti.  The wait staff is very attentive.  You WANT to go here!"}
{"text":"First time there and we were very pleased.  Service was friendly and efficient, food was different and delicious and prices were very reasonable.  Best take on tiramisu I've had.  Even my husband who is hard to please really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and they called us back telling us to come in 15 minutes earlier due to a large party coming in that evening. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation and questioned If we actually had a reservation. They eventually seated us. During the dinner, they had a conversataion about our table and how our high chair was in the way. The waiter was excellent as was the food, but it did seem a little rushed. Overall, the food was great but the hostess was rude and made us feel uncomfortable throughout the dinner.  We hope you have a better experience, as the food was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Ahwatukee and have been going to Arrivederci since it opened.  The restaurant started out with a bang - great food and terrific service - and has gone downhill ever since.  For the last several times my husband and I went there, it has consistently disappointed. A shame because it has so much potential.  My husband and I started at the bar on Friday night, then decided to move to a table.  No offer to help move placemats, silverware.  My husband spilled his drink on the move & asked the waitress for help.  She shoved a dirty, smelly rag at him.  We asked for napkins twice to no avail.  Sat at a table with an unlit candle - as most of them in the place were - and stared at a big, 1970's looking screen with nothing at all playing on it.  Little things - but as a former restaurant owner myself - these things add up to a lackluster expereince.  The gnocchi had its usual good flavor but the sauce was drippy & watered down.  Our waitress actually took her shoes off and changed to flats in full view of all customers - while rubbing her bare feet followed by no hand washing - then proceeded to serve food..yeeech.   Mind you, we are regulars - and BIG TIPPERS - yet the bartender couldn't change the tv station to the Arizona game????  Bored wait staff, no ambience.  Max the owner used to at least be there - servce lemoncellis with your bill, liven up the place, make sure customers are taken care of...no more.  It's the food and it's the service - they need to go together to make repeat customers.  Sad that we can't just seem to get that in Ahwatukee...

{"text":"Staff was friendly. Made suggestions and was prompt with drinks. My biggest problem was that I ordered the chicken Madeira. Maybe if I ordered something else my experience would have been better. But let me go over what I thought the problem was: 

Food quality: meh, the presentation wasn't bad but the actual flavor was not on point. Whether it was the overly salty sauce or the pre-cooked chicken breast they served with the plate. How do I know the chicken was a frozen pre-cook product? The fake, uniformed grill marks are a dead give-away. 

Pasta however, was cooked perfectly al-dente'! 

I'd say, read thru the reviews before you walk in and spend your money here."}
{"text":"Excellent find in Phoenix.  Had a large party of 6, their menu was very extensive, everything from pasta, veal, ossobuco, chicken, fish, etc.  had the eggplant roll ups, grilled eggplant stuffed with a trio of cheeses (ricotta, Parmesan, fontina), spinach topped with a rich marinara - yum!  Sis had the sea bass, encrusted with walnuts/breadcrumb crust, over a delicious mushroom risotto, huge portions.  Chicken Parmesan was moist, seasoned well over pasta with marinara sauce.  Great wine list and delicious red wine selection. Staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and on top of their service game.  We were wayyyyyy too full for desert, but their dessert list sounded awesome as well."}
{"text":"Had to travel on Christmas, it was nice they were open!  They had a minimized menu featuring select dishes for the holiday.  I started with the lobster bisque that had a delicious creamy broth, but the lobster were cheap langostino  lobster.  I also chose the gnocchi with Salmon.   This dish was exactly as I expected it to be, and I loved it.  They refilled our waters many times, and they had quite a number of staff available.  I do agree with other reviews in that the tables are very close and it is noisy. Very difficult to be intimate.  Overall, good dinner, nice staff, and it was great that they were one of the only place open on Christmas!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced. Service was excellent as well. This was my first time in and won't be my last."}
{"text":"This is a cool location in ahwatukee that attracts a slightly older crowd. There is live music on Friday nights and the staff is super friendly. Great happy hour prices if you can make it in before 7pm. I also loved their table bread and evoo/balsamic but their appetizer jumbo shrimp was just alright with a slight hint of lighter fluid from the grill."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon to try this place. Jamie, our server was incredibly knowledgeable. The tortellini Bodensee had a hearty thick sauce with fresh tasting tortellini with a very creamy cheese filling. The cannelloni de carne was awesome. It had a vodka sauce (half cream half marinara) it was very sooth and a bit more on the savory side/filling. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I'm torn between shouting from the rooftops about how much I love Arrivederci's happy hour and keeping it as my own little secret so it doesn't become overcrowded.  Well . . . here it goes, fingers crossed!

We had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased, we decided we needed to try their happy hour.  I'm so glad we did; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots.  Not quite as trendy as Va Bene, but that's a good thing.  Less of a singles scene, less noisy and the food is just as delicious!  Happy hour is M-F 5-7.

We walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender.  He kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $5.  Wonderful!! He brought us some water (with a slice of cucumber, nice touch), took our drink orders, and gave us a few minutes to decide on food.

In addition to the wine specials, there are happy hour food specials! Half off bruschetta, pizza, and other appetizers.  We went with the Calamari In Umido (large tube calamari saut√©ed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato) and the Margherita pizza. They make their own mozzarella here, people!!

Before we received the appetizers, the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on.  The calamari came out first and it was fabulous, as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth!  Then came the pizza and while it didn't blow me away, it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh!  

As embarrassed as I am to admit it, we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari.  The best part, the bartender didn't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread!  What a nice guy!  Did I mention the bread and broth were delicious?

The bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables.  My favorite part was the living room set up past the bar.  Some comfy couches and a projection screen.  I can't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers.

The service was great, the food was great, the price was right, and the atmosphere is cool and cozy.  What more can a girl ask for?  A couple more times like this, and this is a five star rating . . . easy!"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE everything about this place! The food is great, the wine list is perfect and the service staff (especially the host), is amazing! I've ordered meatballs in spicy vodka sauce as well as eggplant Parmesan. Both phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Attempted to go to dinner and sit at the bar for date night. 

While others around had already been served their wine while awaiting their tables in the dining area - we sat in two separate sets of bar stools in a 15 minute time span and were not even acknowledged by the bartender for a drink / wine / appetizer - NOTHING. 

A waitress was talking about changing out of her high heels and into her server shoes, rolling silverware, but could not be bothered to recognize that customers were being ignored. 

Then the \"bartender\" was coughing his lungs out while using the computer. Just gross and unacceptable."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday night and it must have been senior citizens night as we were the youngest party by 30 years.    I had the eggplant parmigiana which was one of their signature dishes, but honestly it was about average.   They focused more on the cream cheese fillings than the eggplant which seamed soggy and slightly undercooked and burnt at the same time.  The pasta with sauce that came with it was unspectacular.    On the plus side the pistachio ice cream was deliscous.    Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was good, but we will not be returning.   There's too many other better Italian restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Earlier this year, I wrote that over the last decade, this restaurant had gone downhill.  Last week, I had to return to AZ, and visited once again before my flight back home.  Was I ever glad that I did.  Not only did I surprise my old pals Giovanni (host) and Eddie (manager), but the food was back to snuff.  The veal scaloppini madeira was delicious, accompanied by an unusual vegetable risotto, and recent renovations have made the physical space more open and contemporary."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and it is always solid, good food.   The staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Our family had the wonderful opportunity to dine at this restaurant and I mean wonderful opportunity! Knowing Arizona restaurants consist mainly of corporate chains, individually owned restaurants are rare and not always the greatest.  The gentleman that served us I think was the owner he made sure we felt like we were the only customers in there without hovering. We had the  Lobster Ravs and the Pollo Mostarda Con Funghi, it was delicious! This family owned restaurant is excellent. Can't wait to eat there again. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the chairs are not that comfortable but the food and service makes up for it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wait staff and atmosphere!!! Love this place and will return often.  Reasonably priced also a plus"}
{"text":"Showed up at 630 which is what time I made the reservation. 1 hour in and not going well.  Not enough staff and very unorganized. Asked for butter 3 times and did finally get it. So you may ask how did I rate them a four as the service was not good. The food is that good. Egg plant parm was amazing. Like egg plant cheese blintzes. Loved it. Brother had shrimps and scallops and was blown away.  Vodka sauce so good.  Bring your patience with you as I have none and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice girls dinner the weekend after ringing in 2016. The ambiance is really nice would be great for a date night. They bring bread with oil- great bread, the oil is good - not the best-best, but very good. 
I ordered the Cioppino, which although delicious, was not typical of what I'm used to.  It was served thick, over pasta. Usually I'm used to it being a full soup.  My friends got the penne vodka, and the other ordered a pasta/seafood dish. 
For Arizona - the seafood and fish options are on-point. Mine was very very good, thick sauce, full of flavor. Not the traditional dish I expected, but absolutely a pleasant surprise! 
The portions are very generous. I enjoyed my leftovers for lunch AND dinner the next day (granted I did fill up on the bread). 
Wine pours are very generous. House chianti was very tasty and complimented my meal perfectly. The wine list itself is obvious to be matched to the menu.
I'd love to try the lobster bisque there - usually when its on the menu of a good restaurant, it is very good.  I'll definitely be back, even though it is on the other side of town. 
It was a great meal. I'll be honest, I was not expecting much.  But to find good italian food, with good service and great meals in Awhatukee, that surprise is very much welcome!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner tonight for myself and husband. Really a 2.5 rating. Lasagna was good and hot, but sauce was cold. Chicken dish was awesome. No eye contact with waiter.  He seemed disinterested in our visit."}
{"text":"After experiencing other Italian eating establishments, this has officially become our favorite little Italian restaurant.  Service is always top notch as are the dishes.  They make you feel very welcomed and appreciated that you are patronizing their establishment.  Money is well spent here."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here when we want a romantic dinner alone or to introduce friends to the wonderful flavors of Arrivederci. The owner is always there, and he shows great pride in his business and is ready to greet you warmly. The staff are all wonderful and very professional. The food is beyond delicious, small menu but it is all made with pride. Hand made ravioli and gnocchi, absolutely wonderful! The location is close to other Italian eateries and I have tried them all. Truly nothing comes close to the wonderful ambiance this place emanates."}
{"text":"Husband chose this place for our Saturday night date night and from the reviews on Yelp we thought it would have been a hit. We go out every Saturday night to a different restaurant and this has been the saddest experience to date. Main reason for my low rating is the service was HORRIBLE and the portion sizes were surprisingly small for an Italian Restaurant.  The waiter brought me the wrong side dish and when brought to his attention he said oh let me grab you some pasta (I did not order a side of pasta). Never were we asked how our meal was and when the waiter delivered our check he asked if we had a groupon?? when I said no his response was \"oh good\".

There are many other places (including Italian) to eat at and I am writing this review to let others know not to waste there time going here."}
{"text":"What a nice find right next to Scottsdale airport.  I am a faraway visitor who was playing golf nearby and went here wanting authentic Italian food.  No Bucca or Olive Garden here, thankfully.

The service was excellent and attentive throughout dinner.  Both the veal and chicken parm dinners were very good.  The pasta was a bit overdone.  Salads were nice and fresh.  Prices were in line with one would expect to pay.  The menu has many dinner choices.  Although we didn't get dessert, it looked delicious.

I will return here on my next visit to North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not a great restaurant but good enough. We wanted Italian food and remembered a place we hadn't been to for a few years. It is well organized. A minute after we were seated ice water and bread were served. The bread had the look and feel of a small Rhodes bread loaf if the product still exists. It was very white and quite substantial. The dipping sauce was not memorable: olive oil (I think) and some vinegar (I think) and some mystery herbs. Everything was better from there.  We skipped appetizers, salad and soup. The salads looked good. My wife loved the gnocchi, my chicken, sausage and noodles were great. One friend loved the ravioli and the other the chicken breast. Food prices were fair. Desserts made up for other food prices: spumoni for $7.50 seems high and same for cheesecake. The wine was also expensive  $7 for house merlot is expensive though $7.50 for a glass of Sangiovese not so bad. Service was good until it got busy.  We got limoncello with the bill which always helps.  We wondered how we had forgotten this excellent restaurant. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Mr. C and I met a friend at this restaurant a few weeks ago for happy hour in the bar area. We ordered the calamari, the sliders and the mussels and clam dish.   I really enjoyed the seafood dishes. They were very good.  In fact, the whole table was dipping bread the leftover sauce! (Yum!)    I personally didn't care for the sliders, but my husband gobbled them up!  

The reason I'm totally my rating at four stars is because the group that played that night was terrible. Honestly, I felt like I was being standoffish to the rest of my party because I couldn't hear my husband who was sitting next to me, let alone our friend's friends who sat across the table!  Another thing that bothered me is that this group didn't have a solid repertoire.  One moment they're playing Beatles (which they butchered) then they played \"Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting.\"  (SERIOUSLY!? At an Italian restaurant???)

Because we met our friend for happy hour, we plan to return another time and use our restaurant.com coupon, and sit in the dining room rather than the bar."}
{"text":"While visiting friends in the Phoenix area, they took me here for my final evening together.  I thought the food was amazing.  I'm a plain guy so did the meatballs and pasta and it was out of this world.  Friend had Chicken Marsala and I have no idea how they get chicken that tender.  Service was on point and with a great sense of humor.  Will definitely request to go back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and really enjoyed it. My lady and I would pass by the place when we lived over in that area but never got the chance until recently. She got the bolognese and I got the alfredo with chicken and shrimp. Both dishes were excellent and he service was great. The place is lit perfectly with low lighting and a warm feel. Its not often I give a place 5 stars but this restaurant deserves it. The price is in expensive on par with most chain restaurants but certainly a notch or two above them in every way."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the whole night.  Service was great and food was better.  I made a reservation and they had table ready.  You can not go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Italian restaurants, but my friends picked this restaurant for a Birthday celebration. I was really impressed with everything! The tables had real linen tablecloths. The waitress was super nice, the complimentary bruschetta was really good and the entrees were excellent. Everything we had was delicious. The prices are so reasonable. They gave us tiramisu for the Birthday girl, and I normally don't like anything with coffee, but I couldn't taste it. All I tasted was unbelievable chocolate creamy tiramisu. The best I've ever had! We actually went back the following month for another friends Birthday, and it didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I eat out once a week, and when I do, I bring more meals home with me to eat at a later time,  I'm a widower, and cooking for one is no fun! 

I ate there last night, and for me, it was a Jekyll & Hyde experience.  I ate there four weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience.  I had Emily as a server, I asked for a couple of substitutions on the three meals I ordered and she was very accommodating and very friendly.  She even, without my asking, gave me quite a bit of their wonderful pizza bread to bring home.  The bread is a real treat.

Last night, however, Emily wasn't working and my server was an older fellow who paid very little attention to me.  I constantly needed to ask for refills on my Iced Tea.  Unlike Emily who was always watching my table and at least three times during my meal, she asked if everything was OK.  No such luck last night.

To top everything off, one of the substitutions I requested was for meat sauce instead of marinara sauce on the ravioli dish I took home.  The server said OK and I thought it was.  But, when my bill came, I was charged $3.50 for a side of Bolognese sauce.  When I asked what that was for, the server told me that meat sauce was more expensive than marinara and that was what the charge was for.  I was floored - Emily didn't do that I said.  But he insisted.  I told him, that if there was an upcharge he should have told me up front.  I left an angry man, and the tip reflected that.

When I got home, while putting my two extra meals away, they felt lighter to me.  I opened the containers, and sure enough the portions were about 60% of the size they were on my first visit.

I am really confused about the difference.  But, Vivala Emily!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a 6:45 reservation but did not get seated until 7:18. Our dinner finally arrived at 8:15. The restaurant was very loud. Food was not worth the wait, probably due to volume. No customer service was offered except \"Thank you for being patient\"."}
{"text":"Hey, I have an idea!  Let's reheat vaguely Italian ingredients that we probably bought frozen, toss together a few Italian words and open a restaurant. Also, let's definitely remind our waiters to smile like a clown when you tell them just how awful the food is after your first bites - Make sure they repeat this step when they come to clear your quarter eaten plates of slop and are told they have just served someone the worst meal they have ever eaten.  I know words like \"worst\" and \"literally\" are overused, but this was literally the worst meal I've ever had the extreme displeasure of paying for.  How in world can someone enjoy eating here?"}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you to Arrivederci working with Groupon for this amazing offer. I've been wanting to try this place out and thanks to the offer, we used it for a date night. Our server: Jamie was super fun, entertaining and never led us astray with food selections. The food was SUBLIME! We had the calamari in red sauce, a seafood with pasta and a lamb shank platter with pasta so tender the meat was falling off the bone once touched with my fork. The only bummer was that they were out of tiramisu by the time it was dessert time. So.....we went back a few nights later to try it....and it was worth it! Yum, yum, YUUUUUUM! Will go back again.
Clean, relaxing environment, live music; happy to support a local merchant."}
{"text":"Great Italian food that I would not cook myself. Very elegant dishes. Would totally go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Our waiter was nice when he was at our table but a lot more attentive to the wine sampling party. I didnt get refill on water or tea until nearly end of dinner. I got the linguine with clams and calamari. It was just ok, sauce wasnt very flavorful. Wife got the 4 cheese and spinach stuffed pasta. She loved it. I felt it was over-priced for the service received and the food itself. The antipasto appetizer is not worth $15."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian food at a reasonable price, with great service."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Waitress forgot multiple items, told us to hold on so she could answer the phone multiple times.  She claimed she was the only one who speaks English.  Food was overpriced!  $17.95 for 5 small cheese raviolis.  Salad had old lettuce mixed in with new. Not kid friendly.  No kid food options.  We sent back 2 dishes to be remade.  Spaghetti sauce was gross.  Since we had a party of 10 they charged over 20% for gratuity.  Never again will we go here.  Totally disappointment!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find. I love little hidden neighborhood eateries that serve great food. Really good authentic Italian food isn't always easy to find in Arizona. But Trattoria Arrivederci (\"farewell\" or \"see you later\" in Italian) is a staple here in the Valley and really offers a nice selection of Italian dishes on their menu. Chef Franco specializes in Nouvelle cuisine which is a more modern way of cooking that presents more lighter and delicate dishes with an emphasis on presentation. Owner Max Sahin helped opened this location in Ahwatukee in 2004 and was pleasant to chat with. When you walk in, you will notice that the lights are dimmed to offer a more intimate setting. The menu consists of a variety of pastas, seafood entrees and appetizers. Items are made from scratch using fresh ingredients and they also have a nice selection of wines to choose from. I took my mother here for dinner on a Friday night. Our server Morgan was a real pleasure to have as a server and really made our night. She shared a bit of her own Italian heritage and was very personable and friendly. I feel like this is something you don't see much in servers anymore. I have never tried lobster ravioli and she sold me on trying it. The dish was outstanding! The saffron cream sauce was nice and smooth and the ravioli are filled with generous portion of lobster tail and crabmeat. My mother got the Canneloni de Carne and really enjoyed it. Overall we had a really nice evening here. Probably my cons of the experience are that the parking can be a little tight and it was a tad bit warm in the restaurant for me (I'll admit I'm a cold weather guy). Arrivederci also has locations in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"We went to this place for the first time since we had a Groupon. The food was ok. The service was okay. The menu price was a bit high for the quality of the food. I would recommend it if you have a Groupon, otherwise I would skip it."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for this place.  The food was good but it was very loud and although we had made a reservation we got less than prime seating.   It was hard to talk because of the noise and because we had people on either side of us about a foot away. It is okay for  a groupon but I would not go back otherwise."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last Friday night.  We were seated quickly.  The pros: the food is delicious, save for the bread you are initially brought.  The bread is rather ordinary white French bread to be dipped in oil and vinegar.  The cons: The food is very, very slow in coming out and the restaurant was only half full.  Took over half an hour to receive our meals.  Being a cook myself, what I ordered should not have take that long.  The waitress we had was too busy talking to her cronies at the bar to give us much service.  I had to flag her down to get another been and some more vinegar and oil for our bread.  They do not offer any draft beers.  My wife's meal, one of the nightly specials, a seafood ravioli was rather sparse for the $21 price tag."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after seeing the reviews.  Initially, I was very happy.  The waiter was a pro and mixed the perfect martini.  The bread arrived, which was four stars, served with olive oil containing garlic and petite diced tomatoes.  The Mozarella, tomato and basil salad was outstanding. Then came the disappointing entree: veal that was supposed to be served in a lemon, butter and caper sauce along side wild rice and roasted veggies.  The veal was wafer thin and literally swimming in an overpowering, greasy sauce; the veggies were ho-hum carrots, broccoli, etc. that were more steamed than roasted (and i suspect came from a bag); and the most unforgivable part was that the dish was served with acini di pepe, a bead-like pasta.  No wild rice was on the plate!  If you're going to make off-menu substitutions, at least have the good form to tell me that when I'm ordering.  Up to that point, I would have given Arrivederci five stars, but a one-star entree averages the experience to barely three.  Don't go here for the veal and certainly not the wild rice."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned Italian family restaurant."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best Italian restaurant in the Scottsdale-Phoenix area.  I'm a New Yorker and really fussy about Italian food,  this place is the best.  From the hug at the front door to the impeccably prepared food, this is my favorite Italian restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

First, we really wanted to like Arrivederci - almost all of my Yelp friends rave about this place but for us this evening, it was just barely Three Stars. Sorry AB, Jody, Roseanne, Yuko and Doug. 

The Carpaccio was cured and tasted more like Prosciutto. 

The Bolognese lacked flavor and was more ground beef and dehydrated onions, with no indication of any celery or carrots. It reminded me of Scottish \"Mince\".  The Chicken Parmigiana was tough and not tender. 

I could go on, but..."}
{"text":"Busy, quaint place in North Scottsdale...make sure you have a reservation.  The yellow and white awning is very welcoming when you arrive and the atmosphere inside is kitschy, but cool too.  The staff was very friendly and really efficient with the crowds.  The food was great - I tried the tortellini soup and the rigatoni alla vodka.  Both were amazing, but just too much food for me.  Be prepared to take home leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"We dined at Arrivederci on a Saturday night with a large group. We had Kelly as our waiter. He did an excellent job. He explained any concerns, answered questions,checked on us frequently and even made a run to the kitchen for more ingredients for a dish that lacked eggplant and it was very speedy.
We were thanked upon leaving the restaurant.
I had the Vitello piccata con carciofi( veal piccata) and my dining partner had the minestrone soup and salmone vesuvio(salmon.) .Both came with rice and veggies. They were delicious. I had the pistachio tartufo( gelato )which was very good and the other dessert we tried was the spumoni.
Prices for our entrees were $18 & $19. and dessert was $7.
I have dined here before,but it has been awhile.
If you can requested Kelly as your server."}
{"text":"They are friendly enough and service was good.  Bread was decent, pesto sauce was good but could have used either salt or parmesan.  Fusilli Bolognese was actually rotini, but good.  I really like the sauce.  It could have used a little parsley for freshness and color.  The cheese ravioli I'm not too big of a fan of, the sauce is watery and salty and it wasn't great?  But its not a dish I favor and my friend says that its not mushy like it typically is so it might be a good version.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hungry for some pasta, I grabbed my man and my groupon and hit Arrivederci. The wall art was.......interesting?  Some strange looking faux Italian frescoes. Not what I would do, but on to the food: 

The rolls with pesto to start were fantastic. Good thing they only gave us one roll apiece or we'd have filled up on those. We split an arugula salad, which had a great vinaigrette dressing.

 For dinner,  I had the linguini vogole-shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari with the perfect amount of red sauce and expertly cooked noodles. My other half had the carne cannelloni, which was super rich, but SO tasty! I had more than one bite and was really impressed. 

We had no room to do dessert, but we did clean our dinner plates. 

Bottom line- super good food, but I can't afford it all the time. Thanks for the experience groupon!"}
{"text":"Just an update.  Went again for dinner with my GF and experienced average service and average food (in quality and taste).  Nothing especially bad, but just meh, IMO.  I think both their service and their food is slowly going downhill again.  It is so freaking hard to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area, especially Northern Italian fare.  Good thing they offer Groupon vouchers since that will save you $20 net, and that marginally makes it worthwhile to eat there."}
{"text":"Amazing new pizzas.  Would recommend the new 5 wood fired pizzas.  Staff is amazing too"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The food is fantastic, service is always friendly and feels very local - but high-end at the same time.  Excellent live music in the bar and outstanding happy hour with great prices, great selection and high quality.  Martinis here are incredible!  Pizzas are made in a real wood fired oven on site from scratch and are amazing!  Dinners are clearly made from scratch from old world recipes and are fantastic.  I would highly recommend this place on all fronts - it's one of my all time Ahwatukee favorites!"}
{"text":"I moved to California 7 years ago after living in Scottsdale 30+ years. Whenever I'm in town this is on my must do list. They still remember my regular dish: Veal with Gorgonzola Sauce. The server and the owner have been here since I first discovered this very, authentic Italian Restauant.
Beautiful ambiance, impeccable service and the BEST food...and at a reasonable price. 
I go for lunch."}
{"text":"Better than I had expected.  Pleasant staff and delicious food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Been here many times through the years. Warm atmosphere and enjoyable happy hours.  Often live entertainment on a weekday or two and on weekends as well.  Food quality is good and most meals are prepared well, served hot and commonly very good service.  Like any restaurant, some dishes are better than others... and a select few are pretty wow!

Overall, very good Italian for Phoenix... yes, I am from NY NY so I have been Super spoiled when it comes to truly amazing Italian food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We have been coming to this restaurant for years. Never been treated so poorly. It is Valentine's Day we had reservations at 7:30 and now we have not been seated and it is 8:00. We stood in line just to speak to the hostess and she rudely told us that everyone there has reservations. I guess greed got the best of them and they overbooked with no concern of what it would do to people's Valentines plans. It is getting later and later we have been forced to leave and wait over an hour at another restaurant. We will never be going back after 20 years of going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hosted a wonderful birthday dinner for my wife at Arrivederci. The service, the food and the wine were outstanding. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was hot, flavorful and just like the Italian we love. Thanks for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. We only go on special occasions because it is special to us. Great advice. Great food."}
{"text":"Just not impressed. Wait staff was okay but for a slow night they should have been all over us. Had to ask the Waiter to get my daughter a soda. Bus boy didn't circle round to fill water until we were ready to leave. Food was not great. Get big portion but flavor seems to be missing. Alfredo was so so but should have used Cremini mushrooms or variety not just button. The meatballs were heated from frozen and really watery marinara.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant one night for dinner earlier this week and really enjoyed my meal! Met a friend there, and she enjoyed hers too!  The bread roll was delicious (comes with garlicy oil, but I asked for butter), and my cannelloni was fantastic.  For a Monday night, the room was full. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. The service was great (an older Italian man) and I will come back for sure! This place has been in Scottsdale, according to the menu, since 1995, but I just discovered it. Give it a try...delicious!"}
{"text":"Having gourmet Italian in-laws, I was a little disappointed, although I know it is a hugely popular restaurant..."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was 'okay'. The noodles are homemade, so we are told, but we ordered about 4 items and all of it was bland. Actually, my daughters alfredo was the only thing that was decent and even then, it tasted nothing out of the ordinary. 

The portion sizes compared to the price are way off! My husband's dish was so small. I actually complained to the GM who said, \"Well, I'm a big guy and it's enough for me.\" Sorry, but that's not really the response we were hoping for. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for happy hour. I was seriously impressed with the food. Not your typical pub grub. The mozzarella triangles are amazing and the fried calamari is something I'm still dreaming of!  Fun atmosphere. Private tables at bar area as well as a sofa and chairs in the corner. Live music too (went on a Fri) and karaoke."}
{"text":"Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Three stars would be \"A-OK,\" which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.

It's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.

I have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those."}
{"text":"Saw reviews and sounded good.  I ordered the Chicken parm. I highly suggest this dish.  Not oversized but just enough for me (but I'm not a big eater).  This is the first time I've ordered this so I have nothing to compare it to but it was delicious!  Lemon drop martini.... kinda bitter.. they use their homemade lemonciello or however you spell that.  Had very good service and that's a big thing to me.  The veal with creamy sauce and mushrooms is what my hubby got... very creamy and veal very thin... he was still hungry when he was done and he's not a big eater!  But he said it was very tastey.  My aunt had a fish special with black olives and capers - she said fish was done perfect but the dish was a bit salty (olives and capers might be why).  My uncle got some eggplant dish with a lot of cheese... was just okay... very cheesy.. so if you like cheese... go for it.  It was just a nice, local, italian place.  Not too fancy, very comfortable, reasonable size dishes.  I'd give them a shot."}
{"text":"First time in also last time in too.  Had an entr√©e and appetizer along with salad. None of the salads are included with the entrees.  Also a huge loaf of what was tasteless and cold when it was dropped onto our table and not served with butter.
Salad Arrivederci was no more than the one we make at home for $ 8.00. Appetizer Mediterranean sliders came and were over cooked and dry. They smelled off & we mentioned to server who said they are Mediterranean and smelled different. We each ate one and at 2:00 am wished we had not The Veal Gorgonzola $ 20.00 was a huge disappointment too.  The veal was all uniform in size and thickness like when you buy lunch meats! Not sure it was veal as it was tasteless and swamped in a yellow sauce that didn't allow you to identify the meat.  It was accompanied with 9 yellow soaked pieces of pasta."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always good and the environment is nice. I have high expectations for Italian food and this place meets it. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My family will be moving to the area shortly and we are searching for new italian restaurants to frequent once we relocate. I was looking at the menu and was shocked and saddened to see veal on the menu. I recommend looking into how the baby cows are treated before putting it on your menu. I promise that you will reconsider including in on your otherwise stellar looking menu. Everything else looked great but we cannot support any restaurant that serves veal."}
{"text":"This was our first time going and we were impressed! Best Fettucini Alfredo I have ever had. The service was genuine and personal. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because service was a bit slow. I would definitely recommend and will be going back soon :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to many Italian restaurants and Arrivederci is Fantastic! I had Eddie the waiter order for me and I was not disappointed. I was served the Veal Marsala and it was oh so good. I then finished with the chocolate Tiramisu...oh my!!! 

Arrivederci is a must."}
{"text":"My wife and I were quite excited about trying this place after reading all the reviews. \"Best Italian I've had in 16 years\" was the one that stood out to me. After experiencing this place first hand, I can tell you, you'll have a better meal at Olive Garden or Maggiano's and it'll be more memorable. 

First off, the server we had was absolutely brutal. I don't know if she was just having a bad day or what, but she was the most depressing person I've ever had serve me in my entire life. Usually when I see someone like this, I try to be extra nice and go above and beyond to be friendly, this lady wasn't having any of it. Completely disinterested in my wife and I having a great experience and gave off a \"woe is me\" attitude. 

Second, my wife ordered a decently expensive glass of red wine. She gets her glass and there are still remnants of women's lipstick stains on the rim of the glass. Pretty gross. When my wife politely asked the server for a new glass, we might as well have killed her first-born son. She didn't seem to care or give any sort of reaction. Almost like it happens often. Concerning...

Third, with the food, I've never been more disappointed in my life. The Caesar salad tasted like the bagged salads you buy at Safeway. Ok, a salad is a salad, I was willing to look past it and was anxious for the main course. I ordered meatball lasagna and my wife ordered fettuccine alfredo. Both were so poorly prepared that we both didn't finish our meals. At Maggiano's down the street the food is SIGNIFICANTLY better and the price is significantly lower. 

Overall, one of the worst experiences I've had in Scottsdale. The only good thing about the experience was the hostess. She was friendly and professional and \"hoped I enjoyed my food\". 

Avoid this place. Save your money and go to Maggiano's right down the street for a better meal and price."}
{"text":"Unwelcoming experience from the time we entered. Food was barely fair at best. Very disappointing based on 2 previous dinners here. Seems like the help are not happy where they used to be very warm and enjoyable. Too many other options available to try this one again, it was that distasteful."}
{"text":"We dined at Arrivederci over the weekend and I wondered if it was the same restaurant I reviewed in December.

We had reservations and the waiter that greeted us gave us the option of a couple tables - we selected one, and he said no, that was for four people (they why was that an option???) I didn't care to sit at the table for two next to a party of 8 + a baby, so he sat us at another table for four (so if this table for four is OK, why not the other one??)

I was sooo looking forward to that nice, warm fresh herby bread roll...it came, but not so fresh or warm. meh. Not being overly famished, I ordered the cheese ravioli with arrabbiata (spicy) sauce. Flavorful, yes, but not spicy as described. The homemade ravioli were large and flavorful, though. The veal carciofi with lemon caper sauce was good, but not great - the sauce was not lemony at all; the veal was cooked to tender, but again, meh.(we had gone to Nick's a couple of weeks ago and had this dish & it was awesome) 

The place was busy - which I'm always happy to see in this economy. We have seen our waiter when we've been there on previous visits - he's not new to a busy night. He wasn't over friendly but did answer our questions, took our order, brought our drinks then went missing. Until of course, it was time to bring the bill.

If this had been our first visit, it would be our last. Still, it may be a while before we return - there are many more locally-owned Italian restaurants that will be all to happy for the business."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The server was nice. But the place had a weird vibe. It has low
Lighting and it's run down.  It's also not kid friendly. There is no kids menu and our server only took our order; we had to call him back to order for her."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!  We went to Italy 2 years ago for our Honeymoon and I felt like I was there again!  Authentic Italian food, we had friends coming in from Chicago and I came on here to find a good Italian Restaurant, just by reviews!  Sooo happy we went here.  Homemade and fresh ingredients.  We had the Gnocci for an appitizer and it just melted in your mouth.  We also had a fablous tortillini soup in a tomato broth, so fresh and tasty.  The Eggplant Parm wrapped in spinach and 4 cheeses was amazing and so was the homemade pistachio ice cream with drizzled truffle chocoate.  Cute, cozy, authentic, reasonable pricing and exceptional portions...can't wait to go back!!!  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food love the real Italian influence the people are amazing and service is amazing! A must try for a romantic real Italian experience"}
{"text":"Came here with my fianc√© after our engagement shoot. Starting with great wine. An amazing appetizer. Our server Daniel was so informative and suggested everything as far as wins, entrees and dessert. We will come back for the good food but even more for the great service and suggestions."}
{"text":"It was my sons birthday and he picked the restaurant. We were greeted and seated promptly. We had the antipasto appetizer to start with and it was fine. I had the Osso Buco. The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone. My son had gnocchi with 4 cheese sauce. It was delicious. My husband had the stuffed Cannelloni which he said the steak was so tender it just melted in your mouth. We didn't have dessert because we were full. It did take a while to get our food but it was worth the wait.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"I took my family here on Sunday and must say I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The restaurant is relatively small with about twenty five to thirty five tables.  The clientele on a Sunday night is largely graying snowbirds with the exceptional family with kids. The restaurant feels more akin to Northern California than Scottsdale, Arizona - that is a complement! 

The meal began with ice water and fresh bread with pesto.  A great combination.  My son ordered the Caesar salad and minestrone soup and left nothing behind.  I had ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo con Funghi which was simply outstanding.  As a matter of fact, my wife and son ate most of my meal.  If you have the opportunity to visit this restaurant try this meal - you cannot go wrong.

My wife ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which is rolled pasta, tomato sauce and rolled pasta which is pan fried.  It appears to be a light weight meal, but is truly filling.  

I would say the food is a five star, the service is somewhat lackluster.  Water refills were not timely, the salad took a while to make to the table and the service is so so.

Worth trying........"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed so writing after only one exploratory visit and a revisit for the one dish that deserved an encore.

The Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!

On the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  \"little Italian lady\" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.

Worth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!"}
{"text":"Be careful using a credit card here.  Michael the bartender charged our credit card incorreclty TWICE!  I had to file a dispute with my bank.  If I go back, I will only pay cash!  It's too bad, with money tight these days, you have to watch very closely."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour, by far.  I haven't yet tried dinner, but the appetizers and pizza are delicious and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"As far as restaurant reviews I go I'm pretty easy going.  I hardly ever rate less than a 3, but this restaurant probably deserves a one.  The only thing keeping it from a one is the fact that it was clean.  We called for a reservation in which we were told that they didn't take reservations for two.  When we got there, tons of spacious 4 seater tables were available but they stuck us back in a two seater wedged literally a food between two other tables.  When we asked to be moved they indicated that they had a lot of four person reservations but if the tables were open after a few minutes we could move.  We were never offered those other tables which stayed open the entire 90 minutes we were there.  Then when the couple next to us left we asked again to move one table over.  They indicated that it was reserved and we could not move.  Again two people were seated at the table.  Not sure how that happened since they said policy indicated that they didn't take two person reservations.  

So if seating doesn't bother you and you've rolled your eyes and skipped over the top section let me discuss the below par food.  We ordered the chicken cordon blue.  Let's just say that if I closed my eyes and took a bite of chicken mcnugget and one of arrivederci's chicken cordon blue bites I would not know which was which.  My vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions.  To top it off my \"famous\" crab cake was more mayonnaise than anything else.  However, my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells.  

The experience and food we got was not worth the 70 dollars we paid and I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband use to co e here years ago and with family having moved to town we wanted a family friendly option. It was a perfect choice. The manager, (possibly owner?) was wonderful and friendly. Service was excellent and fun I'd was delicious. We had the appetizer sample that had a little bit of several things and that was truly excellent. The seasons in my husband's dish was tasty and fresh. Nice plump muscles and great sauces. I had the sea bass which was served on risotto. Nice and light. I have to ask our daughter and son what theirs were called cause I know hers was so good and plentiful that she couldn't finish it but wanted to."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the food at this restaurant.  It is great. In addition, the happy hour is well set up and lots of fun in the expanded bar area. That said, if you go there for date night it's a crap shoot on what kind of service you'll get. One or two of the waiters are surley and inattentive, to the point of being down right annoying. It's a shame because I don't go there as much as I otherwise would. 

If you want reliably great service along with great italian cuisine, I'd recommend Ruffino's on Warner as an alternative."}
{"text":"I'm pissed

I went here on a Thursday night at 9pm looking for dinner

I was so psyched after reading reviews

And BOOO!!!

They stop serving food at 9pm.
Sigh.

So yeah, I'm pissed at them.  I work late most nights and do end up eating out around 9pm.

Why?!  WHY?!

Booo!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this place for a while now and decided to finally try it out for date night. We were really looking forward to a great meal out. I ordered the mushroom ravioli which was good but not great. My husband took the advice of the server and ordered the chicken cordon bleu. Not only did it come out cold the first time but it was just plain terrible. I would compare the chicken to a soggy lean cuisine dish. It was clearly frozen, processed, breaded chicken. For $18 we were expecting so much more. We overheard a few of the servers suggesting this meal as it was a new addition to the menu. My advice would be to take it off the menu. Its not a quality dish. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"After dining here 2 years ago we decided to go again while family was visiting from the East Coast. Our waiter, Orlando, was obnoxious.  While delivering our food, he sang \"La Cucaracha\", served us day-old bread, and held up our payment by 20 minutes.  Disappointing and disgusting."}
{"text":"Cute small place located in a strip mall. Decor seems sparse and dark. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The table seemed sticky and the menus were large and cumbersome. First off, DO NOT ORDER THE CALAMARI! They come in sticks! Beyond bizarre! We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the clams and mussels could have used more wine. The eggplant was tender and good. DO order the osso buco, if it's lamb, veal, pork, it's excellent! I had lobster stuffed ravioli and it was ok. Sauce could have been slightly thinner...  Wait staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. I would definitely go back but this would not be my first choice for Italian..."}
{"text":"Hello Fellow Travelers,
My husband and I had the great pleasure of trying Ristorante Arrivederci in Scottsdale last evening.  Having lived here in Arizona for about 6 years, we always drove by this restaurant yet never ventured in.  I guess better late than never, as our taste buds were delightfully satisfied!

Their mission boasts healthy but tasty food, casual elegance and impeccable service.  Ristorante Arriverderci keeps its promise to all three.  This restaurant's roots come from a native Master Italian chef, Franco, who partnered to bring their special \"Nouvelle Italian Cuisine\" to:  La Jolla, California, Scottsdale and Ahwatukee, Arizona, and finally Houston, Texas.

A:  Upon entering this establishment, you are taken to a most welcoming atmosphere.  To the left hand side, there is a small cozy bar area.  The hostess awaits you with a smile and you see a most cozy dining area, complete with several sections of intimate areas to dine.  The hostess seated us towards the back dining area, where it can be a little warmer.  They are quick though to adjust the air conditioning, to make sure all are comfortable.  The walls have quotes in Italian, along with decor that takes you away to a feeling of dining in a cozy restaurant off the streets in Rome.  We were promptly given water at our table, as well as warm fresh bread with pesto dipping sauce.  A nice touch with the fresh roll of bread served from the basket of a server!

T:  Their menu includes a variety of appetizers to delight, as well as salads, hearty pasta meals, secondary entrees, and their special \"Treasure of the Chef\" entrees.  Prices for their pastas and entrees vary from 11.00 to 19.95.  Their portions are large, so you are certainly receiving every cent worth you pay.  I ordered the Campagnola salad and Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs for my main course.  The salad was crisp and refreshing, along with a generous portion of balsamic vinaigrette. 
The Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs will satisfy any pasta and meatball craving!  A more than ample serving of large rigatoni pasta, mixed in with a generous serving of their tomato sauce and homemade meatballs makes for pasta dish deliciousness.  Their seasonings within the dish bring the a taste that no other that I have tasted in the valley.  About 4-5 meatballs are included, so the carnivore in you is also satisfied.  This dish makes for an extremely filling meal. 
They also have dessert if you still have room left over from your meal!  :)  Next time, will have to save some room to sample their dessert which I am certain is quite unforgettable as well.
Upon closing out our bill, we received a shot of limoncello to help with digestion.  An extremely nice touch to close out our meal. 

E:  Our overall experience was one not to be forgotten.  Even a nice touch with our waitress' tie embroidered with her initial.  :) I wish we would have ventured into this establishment all the sooner.  I guess better late than never, and will certainly make up for lost time!

I will never want to say arrivederci to this restaurant!  I will say hello many a time in my dining future.

Your Honored Guide,
--Christina"}
{"text":"Excellent all across the board. The bread is amazing with the olive oil dip. My mother-in-law is from the central region of Italy and this is her favorite place to go they even gave us complementary limoncello as an aperitif amazing. My favorite menu item is probably the lasagna or the homemade ravioli. My 1 & only complaint would be the lemonade I understand this is definitely an adult restaurant but we always bring our kids as they are little foodies in the making. I can tell the lemonade is some sort of Minute Maid / country time whatever & my kids drink it but they don't really like it and as high class as this places I think everything should be top notch. May I suggest buying Simply Lemonade from Frys or Safeway? It's really not that much more expensive and it literally tastes like it was made from scratch. Otherwise this place is perfection."}
{"text":"After a couple of years of my absence I returned to experience a magnificent culinary  explosion of flavors and colors!  Boy, had I been missing out.  We had an appetizer of fried calamari steak strips, cooked perfectly and enrobed in a delicate tempura breading, accompanied by a spicy red pepper sauce, lovely. Next I had Cioppino Dello Chef, an ample centerpiece of salmon surrounded by clams and mussels in their shells, large shrimp and delicate little rings of calamari, all atop a bed of linguini al dente, bathed in a spicy garlic red clam sauce, and my wife ordered Salmone Vesuvio, a thick pan sizzled king salmon in a lemon-white wine/saffron reduction with a touch of cream, accompanied by rice and vegetables, wow!  Our server, Morgan, who was as friendly and efficient as she was easy to look at, took wonderful care of us.  What a great evening and a great meal.  Just try and stop me from coming back for another five star meal.  Don't miss this opportunity to pamper your senses.  Good-bye or should I say \"Arrivederci\"?"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal at all. Ordered the eggplant appetizer. First cut into it and oil flooded my plate. Could not get myself to eat it. The main courses were completely forgettable. The service was pretty bad too, had to wait forever until someone came and took my order for the second glass of wine. First time here, and probably the last time. Don't care too much about the bad service, but really bad  food, that is not acceptable."}
{"text":"It was such a welcoming restaurant. We loved the waiter, Giovanni. He was amazing.  We let him pick our entree. We enjoyed the halibut and the shrimp arbitta, a spicy Penne dish. 

The setting was very cozy. We were able to have a nice intimate dinner.  

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Having read some negative reviews lately we chose other Italian restaurants although we had liked Arrivederci's before.  Friends invited us to dinner and here we came.  Though not as busy as we had experienced in the past, the food and service was what we had remembered and were glad we came.  It seemed that the main complaint was reservations not being honored in a timely fashion.  I hope this is not the case, as we have always enjoyed our evenings here.  Perhaps that is why the restaurant didn't seem as busy as before.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at this restaurant is so long and ordered takeout since we didn't want to bring two young children to the restaurant. After calling in the order the woman said 15 minutes. So I got to the restaurant 20 minutes later, just because I didn't want the food to get soggy. I sat and proceeded to wait an additional 30 minutes for the food to be ready! Not once did anyone working there ask if I wanted a drink or water or anything! Even though hey are a bit pricey, the food is still good, but awful service!! And that was only for take out, can't imagine how it would have been if we actually ate there. Probably won't order from here for a looong time."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.

The cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.

We both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.

We started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.

Our meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.

My guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.

For dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!

My favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Christmas Day, but they were way too busy to take us in. 7:30 reservation, I arrived at 7:15 but couldn't even check in until 7:35.  

At 7:50, no end to the line was in sight so we went elsewhere. 

A they shouldn't have taken our reservation if they were so busy.  Wasted an hour of my time."}
{"text":"Great Lasagna! Nice Little Spot For A Date!

The lasagna was one of the better lasagnas I have ever had. Just the right amount of crisp in the top and tasty cheeses and sauces. 

The atmosphere is great for a date or quiet get together. Clean and cozy place. 

Parking can be a bit tight during busy times as it shares the lot with a strip mall."}
{"text":"It has been almost 18 months since I was in Italy but I felt like I was there tonight!  As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a family of Italians, some with great mustaches by the way! I love that the place is somewhat small and quaint as it makes the servers easily accessible even when busy.  The food is absolutely amazing!  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan which was delightful.  I had the veal with wild mushrooms and pasta, so flavorful it was with the perfect amount of gravy!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The bread and oil at the beginning was good. The Caesar salad was decent and huge (I recommend sharing between 2-3 people). We got 2 main pasta dishes, both had penne noodles from a box and spaghetti sauce... I could have made this easily at home. I would have liked fresh pasta, but oh well. We will probably not be back. Both pasta dishes were enormous, and we got 3 meals out of each one when eating leftovers."}
{"text":"So we started with the porabella mushroom appetizer, it was cooked perfectly but had a little to much salt. 

I had the fettuccine with mushrooms, it was a rich Alfredo sauce and all the mushrooms where cooked to perfection. It was a large portion but oh so good. 

My grandmother had there new eggplant parmesan, as she said it was so good and everything was cooked to perfection, nothing mushy. 

My grandfather had the chapino, 
It was a generous portion of fish and pasta with clams all through the sauce and shrimp; it was not spicy at all and the portion was also large. 

The only faults that I saw where,
The amount of noise in the small restaurant and that the parmesan cheese ,they ask you if you want any, is not fresh grated it's that powder type. 

It was a great place and I plan to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Highly recommend. Will definitely come back again. Also they give lemonchello at the end of the meal. A little small place but I would consider checking it out."}
{"text":"Totally great location off of Chandler Blvd. restaurant is situated in a strip mall type place but once inside gives off the Classic Italian restaurant attitude. Food is great, had the eggplant Parmesan and loved it! Happy hour specials are constantly changing to appeal to clientele. Specials available from 5-7, seven days a week. I'd definitely recommend this place as a spot for drinks or after shopping food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would like to thank Groupon for introducing us to this gem of a restaurant in good ol' Ahwatukee.  We went on a busy Friday night, and were seated immediately.  The water we got right off the bat had cucumbers in it - which reminded me of the movie \"The Other Guys\", and it was tasty enough that I didn't order a beverage.  Our waiter recommended the grilled eggplant appetizer, which, up to this point in my 36 years, is the best eggplant I've ever had.  The fresh marinara served on top of it was nothing to scoff at, also some of the best I've ever had.

For the main course I got the spicy penne w/ chicken and sausage, what was most impressive about this was the serving size.  I had enough for a full meal on Saturday for lunch, and it was better the day after once the flavors had time to marry.  The wife got the veal picatta - and said it was probably the best she had ever had outside of Italy.  The complimentary flatbread was warm and delicious, and their homemade gelato was the perfect capper.

We were waited on by the GM, who had a great sense of humor and was was one of the 1st waiters EVER to happily take our groupon - explaining that he's happy to know his marketing is working.  Go check this place out, groupon or not!  MOLTO BUONO!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Max fixed me carpaccio that was not on the menu. Enjoyed the personal attention. Mike behind the bar was super nice. Thank you.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Walked in the the space which was bathed in yellow light. Loud and noisy, but in a fun atmosphere. The service was terrific - 5 stars. We ordered calamari fritti with shrimp (gamberi) and the caprese as appetizers.  Our party enjoyed the calamari but was split about whether the amount of balsamic was sufficient. 
We encountered a lot of difficulty with the amount of salt used on the entrees. Our entrees included orders of cioppino and festa del mare in both white and red sauces. One of the folks in the party ordered the rolled eggplant and said it was inedible due to the salt. 
The red sauce was a little overboard with the salt, but edible. The white sauce was supposed to be a white clam sauce, but it misfired due to the salt and lack of clam flavor. 
The good news about the seafood dishes is that the seafood itself was cooked perfectly. If they straighten out the salt error, the seafood dishes are definitely worth trying. 
Now I do not know if the oversalting was normal. Maybe the chef had a bad day. I would go back and ask for a lower salt preparation."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening, not crowded. Knowledgeable waitsaff.  Had to ask for anchovies for the Caeser Salad after it was delivered.  Nice selection of wines in broad price range. Lighting a little bright, unlit candles on the tables. Spaghetti Vongole had plenty shrimp, clams, muscles and calamari.  Delicious flowerless chocolate cake and complimentary shot of lemonchello for dessert."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for Valentines Day dinner. We received excellent service and were well fed. The portions were more than sufficient and very delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"So good.

The restaurant is admittedly in the most tucked away place. You'd hardly know it was there in the strip mall. Stepping inside however is an instant transformation to a charming little place.

Now when I say charming, I don't mean too fancy. It's nice and sets a good mood. The wall decor is not exactly \"out of place,\" but certainly a bit odd. 

But they could paint Grimace and Burger King sword fighting on the wall for all I care if the food is good.

And the food is good. 

There are moments when food has taken me to another place, where I felt as though I could leave the bounds of Earth behind me. This is not one of those times. There's nothing transcendent about the food, but it's the kind of food that tastes so good that it reminds you to eat out more often. The kind that you think about days afterwards.

The roll and pesto are a fantastic start to the meal, but dangerously addictive. It's hard to slow down to make room for you meal.

Most recently, I had the lobster ravioli. The lobster was very fresh - a rarity in ravioli. The texture was perfect and supplemented by shrimp in the wine sauce that added to the seafood flavor. The raviolis were also cooked to a great heat and consistency. I frequently found myself closing my eyes to enjoy them.

Not the most elegant of surroundings, but really great food for the price."}
{"text":"Lobster Ravioli... I saw yelpers' check in and read reviews. I came here to try for lobster ravioli.  I studied the entire menu but can't find lobster ravioli on lunch menu.... I picked my backup dish... 

I asked the server about the lobster ravioli and she said that is on dinner's special but since they have them ready, they can serve during lunch too!

I started my lunch with caprese salad, which I split with my friend.  They were kind enough to separate the plate after I told her I wanted to split the salad.  I enjoyed the fresh taste of mozzarella cheese.

I also liked the pesto served with bread.  Bread was freshly baked and went really well with homemade pesto sauce.  I never though of using pesto for bread, but they went well together.

Lobster Ravioli.... pasta was very good and enjoyed generous portion of lobster. Unfortunately sauce was a bit salty for my liking.  I still ate all of them as pasta tasted good, so I asked for the second bread and ate the sauce separately with my bread.

Excellent service. We both had bags with us, and the server brought extra chairs for our bags next to our table.  When we ordered espresso, she brought one at a time as she wanted to serve the coffee hot.  I saw chocomisu on the desert menu, I would like to come back to order chocomisu (their menu said only one in the US to serve chocomisu, to the best of their knowledge)."}
{"text":"We were greeted by Erika from Austin, texas. 
She was our server and did a great job.
Her Margaritas were tasty and it was difficult stopping at one.
The veal Piccata was good, it came with lemon sauce and capers.
The fish of the day was Grouper. It was served with creamy tomato sauce,
jumbo shrimp, wild rice, and sauteed veggies. (onions, bell peppers, and zucchini.
Service was swift and we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"I was a little suspect when we first approached the restaurant, in a strip mall with a funky parking lot.  I was assured the food was superb, so with a little trepidation walked in.  It was dark, but not too dark, we had reservations, even though it was not a full house.  They sat 3 big guys at a small cafe table, it soon became apparent that we could not fir and neither could our extensive food and beverage order.  They sat us at much larger table, without hesitation.  Kelly our waiter was attentive but not to much, he knew the food well, and was helpful with all our questions.  I had the Eggplant Arrivederci, it was amazing, as well as everything else.  There is no question in my mind, in the words of Arnold \"I will be back\"."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we drove 25 minutes to come here... 
Came in with our toddler and asked to be seated away from everyone, just in case he got cranky. Asked for a high chair, first one the seat belt was missing, so I had to ask the bartender if there was another, second one came and now we are settling in. 

I look behind me, the two men who came in before us have waters and menus, the other two who came in after us have drinks and menus... 

5mins later.... 


Well, we have been sitting at our table for a good five minutes now, still without any menus....

3 Minutes later.. 

I just flagged down a female server for menus, finally got them... 

Now we are still sitting here twiddling our thumbs... We know what we want already...


Still sitting here, no server has greeted us or even approached us..

10 minutes later...

And now we have gotten up after wasting our time here and as we are getting up everyone's looking at us.

Oh so NOW we get your attention!

Arrivederci!!! 

*WALKING OUT*

The service here is S H I T.

I HOPE I GET MY GROUPON MONEY BACK, I HAVE NO CLUE HOW THIS PLACE HAS GOOD RATING ON THERE. 


*burn out in front of the store*

If I could rate this place ZERO stars I would"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian places in north Scottsdale!  I seem to always order the special, usually some type of ravioli, and I have always loved it.  Never have I been here and heard anyone in our party complain of bad food or service.  Heck the spaghetti and meatballs are fantastic!  Great job and will always be a place we stop when we're in town."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 4 for 7pm tonight. We showed up about 10 minutes early. When we attempted to get in, there was a line out the door. Sadly, it was a host of people with 6:30 reservations. Ugh. So no go tonight for our 7pm rez. We left. We had people from out of town but we went to Alma and had a great meal. We'll go back when it's less of a crazy weekend. 

It happens. Food's still good im sure."}
{"text":"Cozy place, nice atmosphere, good service. LOVED my cioppino. Eggplant Parm was very yummy. Rolls seemed a big doughy to me. But the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the minestrone was rather bland."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was it was a pleasure. I want to go back and try different dishes and see if this place is for real.  I hate that it is called, \"Arrivederci\" which means goodbye. what were they thinking to make a place with a name that is not inviting.  The ambience is not up to the prices that charge.  feels like an applebees but three times the price. if the food turns out to be good the next time, then I would go back and recommend it no matter what the name is and the ambience. give it a try"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant many times before with a satisfactory experience.  However, last night was different.  First, the menus looked like they hadn't been wiped down recently.While waiting between courses, I looked around the restaurant and feel like it is looking old and may need some updating. Our salads seem to lack dressing but had too many croutons.   I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was tasty, but someone else had a veal dish wish they said lacked flavor.  Dessert was good.  Everything was spoiled as I got near the bottom of my cup of coffee and there was a ring around the bottom of my cup.  Totally grossed me out.  The waiter apologized but never offered to get me a new cup or for that matter remove the charge off of our bill."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend with a group of family and friends to celebrate my bday.  We came here because it was close to the resort we were staying at, and it had rather good reviews.  I really enjoyed the quaint nature of the atmosphere, and we had no hassles when I had to push back the reservation an hour.  Overall the service was speedy and friendly.  The food was really tasty but some of the portions were on the small side.  

Overall we had a pleasant experience here and I'm glad we got to try it out.  I do feel like the prices are a little on the steep side for what we received."}
{"text":"Although I'd been in this shopping center before, last night was my first time dining at Arrivederci... some friends of mine were in from out of town and suggested we meet here for dinner.  I bit my tongue instead of suggesting Giuseppe's instead and figured, why not try somewhere new?

I'm happy I did.  I was extremely impressed with Arrivederci.  Service was fantastic, portions were really big, and the company was a cherry on top.  There were 5 of us total, and I think everybody was happy with our experience.  We received fresh warm rolls and a pesto-olive oil sauce off the bat... yum!  Our waters and drinks were refilled constantly which is always a big plus.  Side note - everytime I said 'thank you,' our Italian waiter replied with a 'prego' - so charming; it made me feel like I was really in Italy!

I started with the arugula salad... it was lightly dressed with a perfect balsamic, and had just the right amount of tomato, parmesan cheese and artichoke.  (I think the artichokes came from a can, but I like canned artichokes, so it was fine with me).  The others seemed to enjoy their caesar salads just as much.  For my main entree, I had the linguine vongole cozze e calamari (Linguine with clams, mussels, calamari and zucchini) in red sauce.  It was delicious!

Other dishes at our table were the spaghetti and meatballs, and a pasta dish that had Italian Sausage, chicken breast, bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, sauted in white wine with a touch of tomato sauce - that was a hit as well!

We were all too full to order dessert this time, so I'll have to remember to save room my next visit.  I really don't think you can go wrong dining at Arrivederci... it's casual, charming, local, and they've proven successful since they've been open since 1995.  Cheers to many more years of success... Gratzi Arrivederci!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The food here is wonderful and the wait staff and bar are so friendly, you really couldn't ask for anything more! I love the new expansion to the bar area, and whenever we think good Italian food, we always pick arrivedercis. You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. We go back every couple of months but we just can't seem to put it on the normal rotation of places. 

They are always out of something. This type it was the Caprese Salad. At 6:30pm. Really?  A salad?  How hard can that be?  Last time it was the wine list. It got to the point where I asked them \"why don't you just tell me what you do have\". 

Then they burned something in the kitchen and the smell permeated the restaurant. Nasty. 

Food is normally pretty good but nothing spectacular. Service is usually pretty decent as well. We used to love when Tommy was a server there. Not sure where he ended up. 

The last few times there, the place was nearly empty except for the bar area for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"They were out of bolognese, my first choice.  They were out of bread, which is a big no-no for an Italian restaurant.  However, the waiter was extremely well versed in everything on the menu and was very cognizant of the fact that it was a problem.  I think he went out of his way to give detailed explanations of  the other dishes, but I liked that.  His guest service was excellent and he did a perfect job of making us forget about the bread.  

The food certainly helped.  We ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which was excellent.  Waiter suggested a side of meatball to go along which complimented the dish well.  I can honestly say the meatballs were about the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of damned meatballs.  We also ordered the Spaghetti Vongole, which had just the right mix of seafood and had an excellent flavor.  I will definitely be back, and I apologize to our waiter for forgetting his name.  Probably lack of carbs!"}
{"text":"Only giving them one star because the bread was very good.  We sat at our table for 15 minutes before our waitress contacted us.  She acted as if we were annoying her and was very standoffish.  It made me think that we were at a diner in the middle of nowhere and we're dealing with a burnt out employee.  Now the food.. I ordered the chicken parmigiana.  The sauce was very watery and caused the chicken to be soggy and have the texture of boiled chicken.  The sauce tasted and had the consistency like a over salted tomato juice. I have had better jarred sauce. I only ate it because I was starving because I waited 30 for my food. My wife ordered the chicken and gnocchi. The sauce was a brown thick and salty.  The pieces that didn't have sauce on them were very good.  The gnocchi was sad looking and very large almost like a small scallop.  It was covered in the brown goo that was supposed to be sauce. They were inedible.  
The waitress ignored us completely during our meal and had to wave down another wAiter to fill our drinks.
Way over priced for the quality of food. It seems like they forgot why they opened a restaurant and were trying to make as much money as they can before they close the doors.  
I would pass.."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  We just ate there for the first time with a large group.  We changed our party size and reservation time twice and they were nothing but cordial.  The food was great, service was great.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am not a picky person.  No really!  I'm not, but I had such a horrible experience here I had to share.  I made reservations for tonight at 5pm since I was told yesterday when I called about going in that night they couldn't accommodate me, and I needed to come in the next night.... But whatever.  I found the whole thing odd when I came in tonight and they did not have my reservation, and then laughed at me and said it was probably on a scratch piece of paper in the office.  Awesome.

I would comment on the service, but other than taking my order, it was pretty much non-existent.  Oh wait, they did stop by 30 minutes after taking my order to drop off some burnt bread and to tell me they were having \"printer issues\" and my appetizer would be out soon.  I'm not sure what kind of Jetson's kitchen has a printer that makes my food, but again, whatever.  I waited tables in college, so I know that's code for \"I forgot to put in your order\".  15 minutes after that, my appetizer came out.  In my world, 45 minutes to wait for your appetizer is pretty bad.  And I'm not exaggerating.  It really took that long.  

Since I was pretty hungry at that point, the appetizer disappeared quickly.  I honestly probably would have liked it if it hadn't marinated in my bitterness for 30+ minutes, but I wasn't impressed.  I looked at my watch when that was polished off and it took another 30 minutes from that point for the entrees to come out.  

Now, really, any entree at that point was pretty much doomed.  Its hard to like anything when your irritated, however, for $19 a pop, I was not pleased with the quality of my entree.  If it's going to take you over an hour to cook it, it better have some freaking pizzazz!  Again, I am quite confident that it didn't take them that long, and they just forgot about me.  I get that, but i have been many places where the way they handle the screw up is so impressive, I come back for customer service alone.  That is not the case here.  Please tell me your sorry, comp something, bring me some wine... Something!!! 

And like I said, the food never even stood a chance....  Needless to say, I will never be back."}
{"text":"Every year my father loves to celebrate his birthday by eating here.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  Sometimes it can get a bit loud, but we love it.  I always get the veal Gorgonzola. And we always love the clams and mussels and the bread dipped in the broth is super fine.   This year my father got veal piccata, my husband got some sort of salad, my son a pesto pasta with meatballs, my mother chicken cordon bleu, and all loved their dinner.  Celebrating his 75th...hope to be back many years to come!"}
{"text":"Not sure what took us so long to eat here!  Delicious!  We started with the calamari, amazing, a healthier (non-breaded, non-fried) version.  Wait...I forgot to start with the yummy bread and homemade pesto!  We shared the Fruiti de Mare for dinner, not sure I'd ever order anything else.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Impressionante! La mia famiglia fidanzate viene qui tutto il tempo e ho incontrato i suoi genitori per la prima volta qui. Grande esperienza. Alimenti, happy hour, e il servizio sono ottimi. consiglio vivamente.

Haaaa!  Italian yo!  Put it into a translator.  But seriously the places is awesome."}
{"text":"Joe and I thought the owners were super welcoming! The ricotta cheese stuffed ravioli was the perfect plate of ravioli, if you're having a hankering for ravioli. The chocolate tiramisu released endorphins galore! This is an authentic Italian restaurant, with Italian servers and the chef knows what he/she's doing. It's dimly lit, romantic, although there were families with older kids there. It was a nice mix, no screaming toddlers to ruin the mood."}

{"text":"As always it was awful. Chicken was chewy, cheese was burnt, didn't get a single refill, and spent at least half the visit waiting on the check. It is like this EVERY TIME. I'll never understand why my family insists on this restaurant for events, I wouldn't choose it in a million years."}
{"text":"I guess you have to be a local to love this place. Went there only because the resort we were staying at recommended it, included a free desert. 
Service was not the greatest, nor was the food. Seemed like the locals got a little more attention and service. The food was average at best, your typical Italian local restaurant.  The best part was the shot of limoncello they give you at the end of yoru meal."}
{"text":"visited arrivederci on chandler blvd in ahwatukee on saturday night for our 39th anniversary. had a groupon to try the restaurant. the servers, both tony and buzz were very personable. we talked quite awhile about our being from the same area of the country with buzz and very much enjoyed their stories. our meals consisted of chicken cordon bleu and linguine alla checca with shrimp. both were very good and the linguine dinner especially was a huge portion. we accompanied our meal with two glasses of smooth pino grigio wine. the servers are very attentive without being intrusive. at the conclusion of our meals, joe brought us a serving of torta caprese with a candle on top plus two glasses of raspberry cello liquour. very nice and unexpected touch to close out our evening. we must say everything was well done and service was impeccable. will surely return again. very highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my fianc√© and his mother for happy hour. The ambiance is nice and it's a very cute little bistro. We ordered two rounds of drinks and four appetizers to share. The food and drinks were average, but the service was terrible. The waitress was rude and made us feel bad about asking for more bread. She had a serious attitude problem. We asked for two refills of bread to use with the sauce from our appetizers; she made us feel like we owed her an explanation to why we wanted more. We weren't just freeloading but she made us feel like we were. Between her and the average, yet overpriced, food...it's safe to say we don't want to come back."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal; we'll be back.

Chose Arrivederci based on Yelp reviews; arrived hopeful and wasn't disappointed. Smallish (about 30 tables) with a definite non-chain old world Italian restaurant feel to it. 

Service was excellent - greeted with an honest smile on arrival and it continued throughout our meal. Casual but respectful, and very attentive. Perfect. 

I had the Hess Cab and my partner had the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, both about $9. Wine list was small but adequate with a good spread. The Hess was excellent. 

Hot dinner rolls arrived with a pesto/tomato dipping sauce that was excellent. We then split the antipasto tray, all very good. 

For entrees I had the lobster ravioli special and my partner had the grouper in saffron sauce; both were excellent and quite rich but not overdone. My mixed field greens side salad with Gorgonzola dressing was crisp and fresh. 

The busboy arrived at just the right time: when clearly we were both finished yet without sitting for an extended period when we were. None of the picking up one of the diner's plates while others are still eating which has become the norm and yet is so rude. 

Our waiter then arrived a minute later with a couple of small glasses of Limoncello, what a perfect touch. 

We were tempted by the desserts but just couldn't manage it. Next time. 

This is what an upscale family Italian restaurant is all about folks. If you're looking for a huge, chain style place like Brio (where the food isn't bad) with decent but sterile service and a room big enough to seat hundreds, this isn't it. If however you'd like to settle-in to your cozy corner table in a place you could easily be recognized as a regular, and wrap yourself around some delicious food in an honest atmosphere, this is it. Restaurants come and go but apparently Arrivederci has been around for 17 years and I can understand why. 

What a nice time we had! I only wish we lived closer, but we'll definitely be making the drive to come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. Can't beat the service, food quality and prices. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. It pains me that this place is even listed as an Italian restaurant. As an Italian-American I do understand good quality Italian food. This place served quite the opposite with pre-made frozen raviolis and stale bread. The service was awful and slow. Had a rude waitress. Do not recommend!!"}
{"text":"After hearing good things, we tried this restaurant for the first time, and are very glad we did! Bottom line: the food and service is excellent, but be prepared to wait if you visit on the weekends EVEN WITH A RESERVATION. The restaurant is small. So small, that I'm surprised that they take reservations at all, since many small establishments don't. Our original reservation was on a Saturday at 7pm. On Saturday morning I happened to check OpenTable and noticed that both the \"6:00pm\" and \"6:30pm\" slots were sold out. Because I had read through all the reviews, I knew this meant we would probably be stuck waiting a while when we checked in at 7:00pm. Because we had a show to get to after dinner, and I didn't want to risk a rushed meal, I changed our reservation to 6:15 and I am SO HAPPY I did! When we arrived at 6:15 and place was packed and we were seated in the LAST open table. Minutes later, as I predicted, people started showing up for their 6:30 \"reservations\" and there was no available tables. As we were seated very near the host stand, the rest of our meal was spent listening to some very angry people who had to wait. Note: there is a bar in the reception area to make the wait a bit more bearable. Luckily, the food and service were so good that this didn't put a damper on our evening. As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the tables are VERY close together, and as such, the atmosphere is VERY LOUD, so if that bothers you, I would avoid this restaurant altogether. We had the Caprese Rustica, Lobster Ravioli, Chicken with gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce, and the Chocomisu (dessert), and enjoyed every last bite! Overall, I would recommend this restaurant as the food and service are top-notch. If you don't want to risk a wait wait, it's better to visit during lunch, or before 6:30pm on the weekends. If you don't like lively restaurant atmospheres (noise) or sitting too close to the tables next to you, this is not the best place for you."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nicely decorated, both had the osso bucco special that was under $25 - fabulous! Especially compared to the $40 price tag that's on the same dish at other local restaurants. Looking forward to going back to try happy hour!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. The owner is a genius with Italian food and everything is fantastic. Been coming to this place for 6 years and never a bad experience. Three tips: the sea bass is to die for; they are very generous with salad dressing so if you aren't a dressing person ask for light or get it on the side; and the lemoncello is house made...don't skip it. 

The wait staff is incredible, (feel like family to me now) and have been there forever, which means they simply cannot give bad service. Avoid Mother's and Valentine's; (get an imagination...really? A meal out? Cook for and wait on her yourself!); and the service will never be a problem. Walk in, get a table, and enjoy a relaxing perfect evening of Italian bliss."}
{"text":"Tucked away just off the corner of Thunderbird and Scottsdale Rd, I've driven down Scottsdale Rd hundreds of times and have never seen it.  Thanks to Groupon, we found this joint.  There's a Ferarri Testarossa parked under a small canopy as you enter the restaurant....very retro/cool, was expecting to see Tom Selleck in the restaurant...LOL  Actually, it's pretty cool.

The place was packed when we arrived, good thing we had reservations via Open Table.  We were seated immediately and the hostess gave us our menus.  After browsing the menu for a while, we decided to order:

Caprese Salad, $7.95

It took a while to order our Wine and food.  They were busy and our waiter had his hands full, so the hostess came by our table and took our Wine order....that was a good thing, kept us distracted...LOL  While were waiting, a busser brought out some Bread and Oil for us...the Oil was a little different than most Italian joints...it had chunks of Tomato and green herbs & spices in it...almost like a Salsa (see pic below).  It was very good.

We ordered our food and after a short wait it came out.  The Caprese Salad appetizer was very good and perfect for 2 people to share.  The portion size was just right and we didn't get full before our entrees came out.

A short time later, the entrees came out.  I sampled a little Gnocchi from The Better Half...it was very, very good...yum!  I had the Ravioli....they were cooked perfectly al dente...the Tomato Sauce was homemade with fresh ingredients and full of flavor.

After dinner, we were surprised with a complimentary shot of Limoncello from our waiter.  He said it was to help cleanse the palate for Dessert...great!  He read our mind...we ordered a Chocamisu to split for Dessert.  It came out a short time later and was heavenly...soft, creamy, sweet just like it's supposed to be.

Overall, we were very pleased with our visit to Arrivederci.  We can't wait to come back soon.

{"text":"Food was fresh and simple, as Italian is best.  Didn't order any appetizers, but eggplant Parmagiana was delicious!"}
{"text":"Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...I'm sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b"}
{"text":"1st visit, my advice is not to order the antipasto plate (frozen ham) and not worth the price.
We waited for water but you were busy so I'll kind of overlook that
The food was excellent and we will be back
Friendly despite being busy
great ambiance
clean
I can improve the review but for now this stands as it is"}
{"text":"A friend took me there today and we were the first to arrive for lunch. Our server was delightful and we were over the moon when he brought us fresh bread right out of the oven (almost burned our fingers) and pesto for dipping.  Pesto taste was well balanced and not overly oily.  The eggplant in our appetizer had great texture and the sauce was flavorful.  My linguini dish was delicious also I would just prefer the pasta to be a bit more al dente. My friend really enjoyed her gnocchi too. It was really hard for us to not finish everything on the plate .  We took the rest home and our wonderful server gave us extra bread to enjoy with the take-home portion. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is awesome. Showed up without a reservation for two within 20 minutes we had a great table. Within 20 minutes we ordered, received a salad within another 20 minutes and our dinner showed up about an hour later. Waiter was very apologetic and gave us a free glass of wine and a free dessert. This ended up as a three-hour dinner, with plenty of entertainment watching everyone. The dinner was awesome Sea Bass was the best I have ever had. Salad incredible, Desert was fresh and home made. Yes, I loved this place will definitely go back just can't go if I don't have plenty of time we would never make it to a show on time."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the Valley- We just had a party of 22 & all the food was perfect- Service was outstanding - Could not have been a better place!"}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough for this establishment and their food. The servers are awesome! The food is even better. Everything is homemade and fresh! I had the home made raviolis (I have an obsession with eating raviolis at authentic Italian places). They were to die for!!!! The wine with dinner helped make it even better. The servers made sure we had the perfect pairing. Will we be back? Of course, it is the best. PS-they will be closed this week until the first week of July for remodel."}
{"text":"Wrapping up our stay in Phoenix, the manfriend and I were hoping for a pretty decent meal here, after the previous night's amazing dining at Quiessence.  What a let down, even though we got a good laugh out of the Ferrari parked out front (how many plates of pasta sold?!)

I grew up in with a Sicilian family and spent years on the East Coast, eating literally hundreds of meals in restaurants all throughout New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  My opinion is that I have tasted authentic American-Italian food from the gamut of my grandfather's bolognese sauce (to die for) to off the Jersey turnpike dive Italian joints (to die from).  I appreciate a good dive joint with homey Italo-US grub.  This ain't it.

+ 1 Star - Decor.  I love the kitchy (ok, downright tacky) walls painted with the Italo-city flair.  It's just the perfect hideous companion to the checkered table clothes and low grade china/glasses.  It works for me.
+ 1 Star - Waiters.  I love grumpy Italian waiters! Their presence usually means that there will be some good food coming.
- 1 Star - Bread.  What is with the hideous squishy white rolls?  At least they were warm and came with some pesto dipping sauce.  But they were more like sandwich rolls and less like dinner bread.
- 1 Star - Pasta.  Why is the pasta cooked to paste?  Is it because we were the only diners in the place without gray hair, maybe they can't chew the al dente anymore?  Squishy noodles that became paste in my man's dish, and blubbery tubes that couldn't be forked (I had to spoon them!) in mine.
- 1 Star - Sauce.  I had vodka sauce.  He had al fredo with mushrooms.  Not a good comment when he says: \"It tastes like beef stroganoff without the beef\".  My vodka sauce was not bad, but nothing I would think about twice.
- 1 Star - Grated Cheese.  Not fresh grated.  Likely bought in bulk - was actually \"sprinkled\" over my food (by request) with large sticky-glumps of it bouncing off the edges of my plate.  Had zero flavor - just a mild saltiness.  Obviously cheap quality.
- 1 Star - Bus person.  Hey lady!  Why would you come and ask my date if he wants a box for his pasta leftovers (ugh! no thanks!) while I am still SPOONING food into my gullet?  There are plenty of other empty tables, so why rush us?  Oh, and you don't have to come by twice and ask it.  Get us some more grainy Phoenix tap water, why dontcha?
- 1 Star - Price.  It felt overpriced to me to pay $15 for his plate of mediocre pasta with no protein (chicken, salmon, meat).  And just about that for mine.  Add one beer (I had water) and we are hovering around $40 with tax/tip.  Silly.

I really would like to give these guys below a 2 but they weren't quite nasty enough to rate a 1.  I don't know what all these people who are rating this place 4 and even 5 stars are thinking.  Maybe they are comparing it to Olive Garden (I mentioned that place to my man and he said he thought the OG food was better than here!) or Macaroni Grill? This is a place for people who have mediocre taste buds and little experience with innovative dining.  
For me, I won't bother coming again and neither should you."}
{"text":"This was the most authentic italian food i've ever had. I get the Pene with meat sauce every time.  The service is great!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers on the happy hour menu we have been there three times on our last visit to Phoenix"}
{"text":"We found this place through Groupon and decided to give it a try. The place is nice the staff was great, but I couldn't say the same for the food. The chicken tasted like it had frost bite and was cooked; grabbed from the freeze and put on the fryer. There not much else I could say becuz there really is nothing else to say. Will I be back, that would be a negative ghost writer."}
{"text":"$$$$ This place is the most authentic italian restaurant in Scottsdale and the tastiest....I try to go as often as I can...Great Location...Great Service and great Wine and Alcohol Selection...Thanks"}
{"text":"The stars are for the hostess and our server who were wonderful. The 3 no stars are for the food. The sauce was extremely salty to the point of being inedible. My husband's meal looked and tasted like hamburger helper except saltier.  Overpriced and really bad food."}
{"text":"Wow. The lady brought me here for dinner and I am so glad she did. 

It's Friday night and this place is popping.
I had to park in the parking lot next door. When we came in, the hostess asked if we had reservations - we didn't, but they had us seated in no time. We got seated and It was loud! Lots of happy folks talking and eating. That's a good sign!

After a brief wait, they brought out delicious bread and pesto. It was yummy!

For dinner, I had the meat and cheese lasagna. It was a treat. It had a somewhat of a light texture and was just delicious.
The lady ordered rigatoni ala vodka with shrimp. I was jealous at first just by looking at it, but she was nice enough to trade halfway through. Lucky me - that was delicious as well!

We finished off with the cheesecake. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was good.

So that was my experience. 
I hope this place is here forever, because I'd like to make it back a few times."}
{"text":"Really excellent, attentive service in a dim, romantic atmosphere. I had a fettucine dish with a mushroom cream sauce and there was a TON of mushrooms. Flourless chocolate cake has a delicious, nutty texture. 

On a side note, and this is just my personal thing... I dislike being offered powdered parmesan for the entree and caesar salad had pre-shredded parmesan on top. I much prefer, in an Italian restaurant, having a block of real parmesan for the shavings."}
{"text":"The best of the best from fresh fish to mussels and clams to pastas with many different fresh unique sauces to choose from. I especially love the fresh baked italian bread served upon being seated! Our server very knowledgeable with a great recommendations! Very impressive, I can't say enough! Very classy & you can't go wrong! The owner even stopped by to intoduce himself and welcome us!"}
{"text":"From the customer service, to the drinks, to the food, this place is bar none the best Italian Restaurant in Scottsdale.  This quaint, family owned restaurant is Old School Italy with a romantic atmosphere and food to die for.  

Recommended Beverage: Spicy Bloody Mary with Lemon Vodka.

Recommended Food:  Ravioli and Spaghetti/Meatballs."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday night. The experience far exceeded all expectations.

Our server was very fast and attentive to our needs.

The food was incredible! All of us young and old loved our dishes.

The interior is very relaxing and there's a perfect blend in the atmosphere here between romantic and family dining. I had two little children with me and they felt at home, but I could easily see myself coming back with just my wife for a romantic night out.

Overall one the best restaurants in Ahwatukee that I've visited. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. It truly feels like you're in Italy! Everything is so authentic and wonderful. If you like Italian, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Scottsdale Arrividerci a couple of times and loved it. Scottsdale's location has a great staff and atmosphere.  So, we thought we'd try the Ahwatukee location for a change.  
While greeted friendly, the waiters were more into grouping together and conversing than they were servicing the tables.  We went drinkless for easily 10 min - and he'd walked by our table twice!  I hate poor service.
Food-wise tho, they do not disappoint!  Great Italian cuisine.  Great wines (once you get them)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found this restaurant by chance while driving around. The atmosphere was lovely, the staff was so nice and the food was amazing! I had the eggplant roll ups and they were perfect!I was very pleased to find that had gluten free pasta as an option!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this was the worst and most disgusting food I have ever eaten. I came here for my birthday and was excited to try a new restaurant. The chicken parmigiana was so tough and rubbery, I couldn't even cut into it. My fianc√© had the gnocchi with meatballs that were obviously frozen and reheated. They tasted like Costco meatballs. I can't believe they would serve food like this and call it Italian. I think Olive Garden is better than this place. Never going back. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"I had to get the lasagna since apparently they only make it once a month. It did not disappoint! It was 10 layer lasagna with plenty of ricotta cheese and meat and covered in their vodka cream sauce. My friends got spaghetti and meatballs and the chicken pesto skewers. Mine was definitely the best thing ordered, I would not order the other things as they don't seem worth it, although my friends were sayisfieThe main thing I would say is that the prices are a bit expensive and don't totally match up with the niceness of the place. They try to make it seem fancier by closing all of the blinds, which feels a little odd when you go at 5pm and it's still bright as day outside."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised at all the great ratings.  I have to say this was not a good restaurant.  While the ambiance is cute and works for a casual Italian restaurant, I was hoping for a great little find.  I was with two others and the salads were not good - the Caesar dressing tasted store-bought (and not a good store either).  I had the beef carpaccio and have to say it was the worst I have ever had - very tough around the edges and flavorless in the center of the beef.  They were very nice about exchanging it for a salad and didn't charge me for the dish.  I then had the eggplant appetizer and it was basically very thinly sliced eggplant with a mound of mozarella and some decent tomato sauce.  So, it actually tasted fine, but could have been better.  In addition, the prices were ridiculous for what you got.  If it was homemade pasta, I would understand.  But it clearly wasn't.  I'll keep looking for that great Italian restaurant that's not a chain, but stick with Maggiano's until I find it..."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food since we could barely get in the door for all the people WITH RESERVATIONS waiting for 30+ minutes.  My advice is to AVOID this restaurant on weekends or significant dates.  They obviously either overbook or take walk-ins ahead of reserved time slots.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I entered Arrivederci on a Friday during happy hour... They have no draft beer and the beer list in bottles is pretty lame... I ordered a Negra Modelo that was the only beer that I would drink off the list and that seemed pretty strange at an Italian restaurant. I was served my beer and it took 15 minutes before I had to ask for a menu... I ordered the Rustica pizza (Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms and fresh mozzarella) I liked the flavor of the pizza and the crust was really good but the pizza it's self was pretty soggy in the middle I think it could have been cooked more but for $6.50 it's a deal... I will be back for sure for this happy hour really good prices."}
{"text":"Simply the best ambiance, food, and service. Eddie and Giovanni are in a class by themselves for professional, accomodating service. Another great meal last night."}
{"text":"Yum.
Bread, calamari, veal with mushrooms...
Great service, complimentary lemoncillo.
Yum.
Can you tell this was good? :)
Food arrived quickly, I couldn't eat everything and I have a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Mango Sorbet was amazing!!!  The fusilli bolognese was fantastic as well.  We added meatballs to it.  The service was great.  Very authentic Italian feel to the place and the food."}
{"text":"Wife and I had lunch there today and the overall experience was tremendous!  The veal scaloppine and the pasta with meatballs were absolutely delicious and the homemade bread with the pesto dipping sauce completed a great meal. Will definitely return for another meal and we highly recommend this restaurant.  Plus, excellent service!  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is a quiet, unassuming place in a stripmallish area.  Quaint and cute.  The wait staff was great and very attentive, Having been to Italy for a month, I'm a snob about Italian and this place was legit. I had two appetizers as my main meal.. the calimari and eggplant parm. both were delicious.  The broth that came with the calimari was delicious and I loved the sauce on my eggplant."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Very quaint atmosphere.  Live music on a Friday night.  I had the chicken parmesan and the bf ordered the gnocci.  We both really enjoyed our dishes.  We had a groupon and were never given that \"oh, you have a groupon?\" attitude. Service was also excellent.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Arrivederci is one of those little nice family owned restaurants that people keep kvetching the valley doesn't have enough of.  While it's not the best Italian food in Scottsdale, it serves up some wonderful meals at reasonable prices.

For me, it brings back memories of many little whole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants my family and I used to visit when I was growing up in Chicago and Cleveland.  As others have said, the decor is awful but easy to look past.  The \"rustic\" wall paper and wine racks probably had an authentic old school feeling 20 years ago, but the dining room could drastically use a 21st century update.  The Ferrari parked outside is cool for a quick glance, but really just serves as a fairly pointless \"wow\" device.

The food tastes fresh, the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes, and the service is great.  The only thing I don't recommend is the complimentary liquor shots we received at the end of our meal.  Awful.  The server said it would help with digestion.  It left me feeling like I was suffering from indigestion."}
{"text":"We had reservations (on a Friday night) at another nearby Italian restaurant that incredibly, double-booked our table for 10.  We walked across the parking lot to Arrivederci expecting to receive bad news and were pleasantly surprised by their understanding and warm accommodation.  They moved several tables and made room for our group - which was amazing.  We are Italian and foodies and were as delighted with the food as we were the service.  The pasta, Bronzino, veal and eggplant dishes were extraordinary - especially on a crowded Friday during \"snowbird season\". The restaurant manager visited with us and made sure we enjoyed the experience.  The complementary limoncello at the end was a nice touch. This is how customer loyalty is created and it worked!  All of the couples in our group will be returning to Arrivederci.  Thank you."}
{"text":"First and last time there. WAY over priced, 2 servers for the dining room which was a joke for a busy Sunday night. 

Now, we got home after spending an arm & a leg there. About 1 1/2 hours later, my wife developed the worst case of food poisoning! We have been up all night, her battling diarrhea, vomiting, fever and awful stomach cramps. I had to finally call the poison control center for advice. Thank God the nurse I spoke with is reporting this incident. Sorry for this review..,"}
{"text":"Neighborhood GEM..the Vitello Madiera(veal) con Porcini  is to die for...the Pollo Parmese was delicious(tomato sauce is homemade and outstanding)....Eddie...the owner is charming! btw they have the BEST  Melanzana Sorrentina (eggplant parmagiana) in Scottsdale! Authentic superb Italian cuisine.

{"text":"This restaurant was so cute! The staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. Great service, I highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Trying to keep it local, we went to Arrivederci for lunch today.
Upon walking in the door, we were cheerily greeted by someone as they walked into the kitchen. It took a few minutes to get seated. It wasn't long at all and our adorable waiter, Kyle, stopped by the table. They had an eggplant special that sounded like it would be terrific if it were chicken instead of eggplant and a few other specials that sounded good - but we ended out ordering off the menu.
We both got the Gnocchi - the hubby got it as mentioned in the menu with pesto sauce, I asked for mine with the pink vodka sauce. Both were quite good (although, I do think I preferred the pesto). The serving size was so big that I only ate half (and a few pieces of bread to smutz around in the vodka sauce). Kyle brought me a box. Which I managed to leave sitting on the table. :(
damn it, I bet that would have re-heated nicely
Anywho, place wasn't busy - probably 3-4 other tables eating lunch and two on the patio having beverages. It was clean and a nice atmosphere (sort of what you'd expect an Italian place to look like). Once we got sat, the service was super.
We'll definitely go again. I hear good things about the pizza, perhaps we'll give that a try.... ?"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bread and delicious clam sauce. The portions are enough for 2 and I love their homemade pasta dishes.  This place is close to home and sits next door to Thai Basil. Although hidden for those that don't live nearby, the quality surpasses any Italian restaurant in N Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This had to be my best Italian meal that I can remember having. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, something that I normally wouldn't have ordered, and it was delicious! 

The service was excellent too! People that have complained about the service must have come on a very bad night or the restaurant read the reviews and made some quick changes. I seriously couldn't have asked for more efficient service. The person binging the bread and waters almost had them both on the table before we sat down. We were asked several times throughout the meal if we wanted additional bread. Most restaurants make you beg for bread. We loved the bread and pesto, but declined because we had ordered appetizers and a salad, there just wouldn't have been room. 

All in all the 5 stars are for a nice dining experience, the meal seemed authentic, I thought the bread, pesto, calamari, Lobster Ravioli and my cappuccino were absolutely filling and worth the price. My fianc√© thought his pasta dish \"needed something\", but this is my review and I wasn't eating his food."}
{"text":"Disappointed. This wasn't our first time but it will be our last. First, my wife's wine glass had some suck-on food from its previous owner. Then her rigatoni with chicken in pink vodka sauce had bad chicken. She described it as chicken that had been in the refrigerator too long. My food was good. I had the lobster ravioli special.

Our server replaced my wife's glass and promptly ordered a rigatoni without chicken. A manager never visited our table and that ruined the place for us. I understand that mistakes happen. But for the manager to not address the problem or even take the add-on chicken off the bill is unacceptable."}
{"text":"M wife and I found out about Trattoria Arrivederci through Groupon. We were very pleased with the service and the quality of the food. I had the special of the day, seafood ravioli and the sauce was excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Ahwatukee .  I'm a single man and eat out 6 days a week. Max, the owner, and his team are unbelievable.   The service is solid but the the food is outstanding.   Veal Parm, 9 layer lasagna , exotic fishes, unreal lobster ravioli.   Very chill atmosphere.  I just love this place"}
{"text":"I ended up here on my birthday and the bartender made a stellar impression on the phone.
We called around 6-7 on a Saturday night and he said he would have a table waiting. 
I was thrilled to come in, and it was a nice atmosphere. They do well with the space they have. I was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited. 
I ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. Typically I adore this dish, I can make it from scratch so I'm a bit picky about it. It came out with onions which was not on the menu. I despise onions with a passion. I had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. When told she rushed off without a word, although I was still trying to ask her a question. It was really abrupt. She was generally nice most of the visit but I was still thrown off by the weird behavior. Apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. The other gripe I have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. The wine was very good, but again with the waitress I attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. I'm not sure if we would make a return visit. Service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places. My friends enjoyed their food though although were also baffled by our waitress."}
{"text":"Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.

I was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with \"buena sera!\" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.

The true test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:

- Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix.
- Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it.
- Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks. 
- \"Choco\"misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu.
- Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.

Arrivederci is an excellent \"corner\" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the \"would survive in NJ as-is\" test. There is nothing left to say."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends. So glad to see they listened to our suggestion to add stone IPA beer to the menu ."}
{"text":"This place is WAY over rated!!   My Chicken Parm was basically a frozen dinner, the chicken was smashed to about an 1/8\" thick and the sauce was basically a watered down tomato sauce with ZERO flavor.  Oh, and what is that green stuff you bring out with the bread?!?!?  HORRIBLE.  We ordered a salad with vinaigrette dressing, it came out with a creamy dressing and the waitress says .. \"that's not what I had written down\" and walked away. This waitress has a VERY bad attitude and VERY rude.  Her name starts with an \"M\", so I'm sure they can figure out which one.  She ruined our evening.  I'm not kidding .. she was the worst waitress I have ever had and because of her we will never go back and will not recommend this place to anyone.  The one good thing was the friendly lady that greeted and sat us at our table.  That's it."}
{"text":"Was sceptical when I saw to many good reviews, thought they might be fake reviews. 

Stopped in with my father for some desserts to kill half an hour and the service was phenomenal. 

The price wasn't as much as I expected for the quality and service. Much cheaper! 

We will definately return for a full meal next time we are working in the area."}
{"text":"this place is sooo worth the stop! i love the menu , and the quality of the food is spectacular!! i went on my birthday month, and i had a complimentary dessert, and had phenomenial service by the waitress about to turn 21 who knew what the best wine is to oder. the food is soooo good .. you wont chose another italian spot ever ! you MUST go!! and.. they do groupon!!! MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been going to Arrivederci for the last couple of years. The food is typically fantastic, unfortunately I can't say the same for the service. The service there is hit or miss at best! The reviews that have been posted over the last two years commenting on the service are pretty much spot on, and apparently dismissed by the management. The waiters are not attentive, not accurate in their ability to get the order right and generally absent. I have decided we will not be returning to this establishment any time soon, if at all.  It truly is a shame because the food and atmosphere are great but the service is horrible, with what you pay there should be some level of service.

Food is good service is very poor."}
{"text":"My chicken parmesan was forgettable -- not horrible but not even close to the best I've ever had. Olive Garden's is definitely better, and way better priced. My husband got linguini alfredo with meatballs, and that was very good, but on par with other less expensive chain restaurants.

I got cannoli for dessert and it was really small for the price, plus the middle of the shell was hollow. I would never buy it again.

The pricing was high for the ambiance and for what you got; thankfully, we had a Groupon for 50% off. If we didn't have that, I would have felt ripped off. 

As for ambiance, the tables were very close together and it almost reminded me of cafeteria style seating. It would not have been good for an intimate date.

The service was very good, and the host was funny and friendly. Overall the only way I would go back is with another Groupon--otherwise it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Meh.... the food was alright. We went for Valentine's day so they didn't offer their full menu. We were really excited to try a couple of dishes and were disappointed. Their calamari (not deep fried) was literally rubber. My main was fairly good. Eggplant was excellent. Would I go back? I may be willing to try it once more to see if it was just an off night."}
{"text":"It was our first time going to this  restaurant.  The entre was  ok, but  arugula  salad was  very bad. The greens were so old and hard to chew on , it was  practically  yellow.  Never seen anything  like  it.
Not going back."}
{"text":"This is my 6th visit to the restaurant and so far, they never disappoint me. I almost order the same thing every time I go there and it is consistently the same taste. The appetizers are delicious and the pasta is definitely an Italian one. As someone who is from one of those Mediterranean countries, I'm very critical about imported cuisines but this restaurant is definitely offering what they promise. The ambiance is nice, the staff is kind and knowledgeable. You won't be upset"}
{"text":"Great bar for happy hour even though they reduced the number of offerings on it like no pizza. Hint hint, your competitors offer it. Restaurant side is good but service is not always the best. always seems to be a lot of talk going on between the manager and others vs serving the tables which I see seems to be a common complaint about service."}
{"text":"I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.

When we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant! 

It took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water. 

Needless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the very best Italian spot in the valley! It is ran by these fantastic brothers from Sicily, Eddie and Giovani. They make everything from scratch and you feel so welcome like you are having dinner in a friends dining room. I always look forward to the amazing uniquely flavorful warm dinner rolls and tomato basil dipping sauce. Some of my favorites are the anti pasta salad, the salmon gnocchi and their fantastic tiramisu. Each new experience better then the last. Truly an exquisite dining experience."}
{"text":"We tried out this place tonight because right up the street and bought a Groupon!  It is a good date atmosphere for sure.  Food was good, but not wonderful...I am glad I tried it out, but most likely would not go back!"}
{"text":"We came here for Christmas dinner which did not turn out so good.  First when we made the reservation they told us they were opening at 4:30pm, when we arrived they were packed as they opened up a few hours earlier, wish we have known we would have came earlier.  Also when we made the reservation they said they would have a special Christmas menu in addition to their regular menu.  I asked if they would have Gluten free options on the menu in addition to the pasta they assured me they would.  Not the case.  When we arrived they were only serving the Christmas menu which did not have any GF options whatsoever.  None of the apps are GF.  I ordered a very boring salad.  Along with special order what was suppose to be GF penne with fresh veggie but what I received was GF pasta with cooked onions and no other fresh veggies.  They should not say they have GF options when in fact they do not, they only have penne pasta which is GF nothing else.  They should also not lie to customers telling them one thing when it was not the case, we would have went somewhere else.  Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve Dinner we decided we'd check out Arrivederci.
The place was bustling with activity and every one seemed pretty busy but the service was flawless. They are a well oiled machine. 

We ordered a bottle of their Chianti, hubs got the Lobster Ravioli and I got the Seafood Fra Diavolo. Once we ordered, both of us received a puffy freshly made roll to dip in their pesto sauce. Unfortunately, I felt the pesto sauce was lacking of flavor. But the bread in itself was so tasty, I ate it without complaint :) 

Hubs' Lobster Ravioli was very good with two bite sized pieces of lobster tail in the middle of the plate.  However, I think he wasn't filled after eating his whole meal since the dish only comes with approx. 6 or 5 raviolis. It was a bit light for him...

My Diablo was stupid good. I loved the level of spiciness and they were not stingy with the scallops and the shrimp either. I must say, between the Lobster Ravioli and the Shrimp and Scallop Fra diavolo, I'd the Diavolo anytime. 

We both received a shot of Limoncello at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.

Well done Arrivederci. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice location and the atmosphere was very nice and quant. Pasta was fresh and cooked to protection. We go in before dinner rush and there was a line out the door. Wine selection was good. 
Table service bread was amazing and warm. The pesto served w/bread is amazing. Overall great food"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and generous. The service was delightful and authentic. However, the first smell that I noticed, and that kept hitting me in the face, was air freshener. Cheap plug in air freshener. GROSS. The smell of an Italian kitchen is part of the Italian restaurant experience. They killed it with the plug ins. And what smell are they trying to cover...marinara, or mold?  Again, food and service were very good but that scent thing kills it for me.  Also they have not redecorated in 15 years, at least. Close for a weekend, purge, clean and start fresh. And change the lighting. It can be dim without being dingy."}
{"text":"We made reservations based on good reviews and got to the restaurant at the time of the reservations.  We were told that it would be a little wait.  we were ok with that. After 30 minutes, I went up to the hostess who at this point was at her witts ends with angry customers just like me who made a reservation and still was waiting after 30 minutes.  Then after 50 minutes we were told that a party who had a reservation after us was going to get a table because they had a bigger number guests. we were just livid. We demanded to speak to the owner/manager but was told he was in the kitchen preparing food.  finally after 90 minutes we sat down, and the waiter was rushing us and not very attentive. We asked again to speak to the owner/manager and was told he left the building because he did not want to face angry customers. This place is TERRIBLE.   The food was so-so.  Never AGAIN WOULD WE GO BACK THERE. IF YOU HAVE A RESERVATION AND YOU THINK YOU WILL GET SEATED, THINK AGAIN. BE PREPARED TO WAIT."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Delicious food, beautiful restaurant, great atmosphere.  Only criticism is that the service seemed a bit rushed, but other than that it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Visited today for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised by both the character of the restaurant and the quality of the food and service! 

I don't usually do Italian places for lunch, but this place came highly recommended by a colleague. We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch and got table in the center of the restaurant, which was great. They have wine bottles everywhere in here, racked by the entrance, the bar, even in some of the sections of the overhang in the dining areas, which is just plain cool. The hand drawn and painted artwork on the wall and the traditional Italian vibe in this place is really nice, one of those rare experiences where you actually feel like you've been somewhere, not just inside a restaurant, if you know what I mean. It was large enough to bring a good crowd, but still felt intimate enough that it would be great for a quiet dinner date. 

We dined off the lunch menu and, I must say, the bread they offer while you ponder the menu is simply outstanding. It came with a pesto and tomato based oil that was incredibly good and all of us had seconds, thirds and I think even fourths of these things!

As for the food itself, one word: amazing. I had their signature ravioli dish and it was absolutely mouthwatering. I could not get enough and, were there not the risk of looking like a complete pig in front of my colleagues, I probably would have ordered seconds. The sauce was out of this world good and the ravioli were cooked to perfection. I am definitely coming back to have this again, even if I have to go alone, it's that good. 

The service was top notch; friendly, timely and helpful with menu questions, so no complaints there. In so far as a restaurant can make the perfect first impression on a new customer, I think this place has it down pat. I am definitely going back, and I'm definitely taking some folks with me to bring them some more business and to experience their awesome ravioli. What more can I say? I'm addicted and have to go back for more."}
{"text":"Ate here with a party of four. It was outstanding, the food, the wine, the desert and the coffee. It was delicious. The service was warm and inviting. Please go here for the best REAL Italian food!"}
{"text":"Itialian food and it is absolutely one of the best true itialian restaurants in the phoenix area. A real hidden Jen that is a secret"}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we would try this restaurant.  I love Italian food.  We went relatively early so the place was nice and quite.  It has a great atmosphere inside.  I ordered the lasagna which was one of the specials and my wife had the antipasto plate.  She was very unhappy with the antipasto plate: one of the salami's was way to spicy for her to eat, the cheese on the plate was very hard, and there was nothing to use to dip in the hummus.  She only at a fraction of what was on the plate.  The lasagna I ordered was definitely not what I expected.  I ate less than a fourth of it because it seemed to be nothing but noodles and hamburger meat.  I was unhappy that there wasn't more red sauce in the lasagna.  Also, I have eaten lasagna a lot and I just couldn't choke down more than a few bites because it was so dry and funny tasting.  I am not sure that we would try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very friendly waitress, excellent bread excellent  choccimisu for dessert. The veal parmigiana for lunch was rather small and thin and could not cut it with a fork, had to use knife and fork for every bite. Did i mention it was thin yes very thin. Side of pasta tasted OK. Grilled warm sliced mushroom salad was fine. I really was hoping for large portions like other reviewers said to take some home for lunch but it was not the case today."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I found it by accident back in 2001 and I was surprised at how excellent the food was.  It has become the place my wife and I go for our anniversaries, and for special occasions.  The food is fresh and tasty and the service is AWESOME!  Can't recommend highly enough.

*edit*  Fogo de Cho is now our anniversary dinner choice.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"We ate there last night- what a delight. Haven't eaten there in years-a true mom & pop Italian restaurant. We didn't realize they closed at 9 and we arrived at 845, they accommodated our party of 4 and whipped us up delish food- my husband took one bite of his pasta and asked how come we hadn't been there years as the marinara was without question the best he's tried. At my raised eyebrows he added- well the best after yours of course .  The service was courteous; but the restaurant was on the chilly side so we were cold. As I review on food, service, and experience I only gave 4 stars. I'd highly recommend this restaurant, the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. I ordered the muscles and ask for bread so that I can dip it in the sauce and the bread came out 10 minutes after the muscles even though I asked several times how soon we will receive it. Overall service was just not up to par and I was very disappointed because I thought it would be a great dining experience for my girlfriend and I."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and went in for first time. We ordered the 2 specials- seafood ravioli and osso bucco. The meal was amaaaaaaazing!!! The free cheesy bread after you order ALONE is worth eating here. My boyfriend and I both ate and had to take more than half home. I have paid double the price for authentic Italian in Scottsdale and the bill was $75 before applying $40 Groupon, a steal. Considering you'll get numerous meals out of it and the incredible quality and flavor-we will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night after it popped up on our maps. We were looking for a new place to try out. I really wanted to like this place but it was a disaster. I'm giving 2 stars because the lobster ravioli was great.

This place is very small which is ok we can deal with that. Our waitress was pushy and a bit rude. (Although I noticed her hugging several customers so maybe it was just us?) I can get over all of that. What bothered me the most was how dirty our silverware/glasses were. My wine glass had pieces of food dried on the inside. I mentioned it and our waitress brought another one. Our silverware looked like it only passed the rinse cycle in a dishwasher. And at the end she brought us complimentary shots and my shot glass had fresh lipstick stains on it. I was shocked. For the cost of this place the least they can do is make sure what you're eating off of is at least clean. It didn't help matters that when I asked for a different shot glass our waitress had an attitude.

We didn't feel very welcomed here and aside from good ravioli that's all there was to offer. Interesting experience though!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice. First time, excellent dinner with excellent service. 

Second time...horrendous. Had a reservation for 7 pm. Seated at 7:45. At least 20 people waiting with reservations. Unacceptable. 

After seating, our server took our drinks order. Wife and daughter had chianti. The worst EVER. Cough medicine tasted better. 

After a very long wait, the server returned and took our order. My wife and I split the Caeser's salad, which was very good. 

And then we waited. And waited. And waited. People at the next table who were seated after us were done with their dinner. 

I confronted the hostess/manager and told her to just give us the bill and we would leave. She dissuaded us from doing so and told us drinks and dessert would be on them and she would get our server. 

Our server then returned and said our entrees were served to the wrong table and they were re-cooking them new. Oh, and BTW what did we order?  Really?  She had no clue, which lent me to believe she never put the order in. 

They brought another glass of bad chianti (on the house). 20 minutes later we were served our entree. And after we shared their chocolate tiramisu, which IS marvelous and delicious. 

Okay, we felt the restaurant was just overwhelmed and overbooked. It can happen. Not happy, but it happens. 

Fast forward a week later.  I find a credit card charge for $18 on Thursday. Now, we dined on Saturday and THAT charge was already posted to my card. We were never in the restaurant on Thursday!

Contacted my credit card company and they immediately credited my card. 

Nevertheless, Arrividerci has zero clue how to control reservations. The waitress was horrendous. And they tried to scam me for an additional $18 on my credit card. 

Bad enough we had lousy service all the way around. But they are also crooks. 

Won't be returning!  Should have called the police."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place, but small. I had the stuffed eggplant and it was delicious. The spaghetti and meatballs were really good. I loved the meatballs. They were very juicy and tasty. I thought the rolls and pesto was really good. My wife never eats the rolls but she had two rolls for dinner and she really enjoyed the pesto. 
Since this was a small place, they only had two servers who were older and seemed like they have been working here for a long time. They knew the menu and gave pretty good service. I just didn't think they were that friendly. So good service and good food means I will be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place.  I am a huge foodie and this is officially my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Best Gnocchi in town.  Delicious!! Must go!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was pretty good, not great. There was no music playing which felt really awkward when we were eating."}
{"text":"It was dinner time and it was one of those days were we didn't know what to do for dinner. We've lived in the ahwatukee area for about a year and still haven't tried all the restaurants near us. We decided why not Arrivederci? We pass by all the time, but never have been. It was pretty good! We were seated right away and ordered some red wine. Inside, the lighting is dim and romantic. I ordered the 4 hour shank over pasta and it was delicious. I would like to go back and try other menu items, so I'm very glad we decided to stop in!"}
{"text":"For food, I think the place is overrated.  For a wine bar with occasional live entertainment it's a green light.  On the restaurant side tho, I ordered lobster ravioli which was a featured dish at the time.  Did I taste any chunks of lobster?  No.  Were they overstuffed?  Not even close.  The vodka sauce was tasty but no lobster chunks there either.   If you want a salad it is a separate dish to pay for.  This lobster ravioli was priced around $21.  Was there $21 worth of food there?  Absolutely not.  The portion to price ratio is VERY skimpy.  I have had a better portion in a can of Chef Boyardee. OWNER: if you are reading this, you need to invest in a warming drawer.  I have been to your restaurant twice now and both times the food has arrived bordering on COLD.  It's the least you can do for people dropping $20+.  Please serve it hot, (this shouldn't be much to ask for?). Nice small, cozy, environment but the tables are very close together.  About average service.  You will get more for your money and a bit tastier at Buca Di Beppo across the freeway.  I won't be back here, I cannot stand cold pasta dishes and really don't enjoy throwing hard earned money away on mediocre meals."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING Mom & Pops place!  
Dishes: 
Chicken Cordon Blue Al Gorganzola-my husband loved it. I thought it was a little overcooked. 
& Lobster Ravioli-Superb! Very tastey 
They also gave us an extra shot-Lemon Drops to drink for free :)  
It's not very large inside. Nice touch with Ferrari outside!"}
{"text":"Great food really loved my entree. Great service. My mom didn't enjoy her mushroom pasta as much as the last time. Other than that, amazing! Also side note we would prefer the next time if we boxed our own to gos so we know who's food is which."}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner for 15 years and have avoided Arrivederci until recently.  Based on the appearance and location of it, I never thought it could be good.  Well, looks are deceiving.   

I decided to give them a try when I saw a deal on Groupon.  I figured if it wasn't good, at least I wouldn't mind at half price.  To make a long story short, I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, it's not perfect, but take it for what it is. 

If you are looking for upscale, trendy, classy, fancy, romantic, elegant, overpriced, top notch, 5 star, then this is not the place for you.  But for the price, the place is more than satisfactory.  

Atmosphere is minimal, some call it tacky, but who cares, I don't go there for the atmosphere.  It has, however, become one of my favorite, neighborhood standbys and that's exactly what it's good for.  

Prices are extremely reasonable and wait staff is very pleasant and welcoming.  Out of the 5 or 6 times I have been there, 4 dishes or so were above average and maybe 2 were average.  Nothing has ever been bad or even close to bad. 

It's a small, homey, casual, corner spot that's a great, little find   Would I drive 20 miles to eat there, probably not?  Would I return?  Yes, again and again!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food.  And Italian men. Ahhh- my weaknesses.  

The food at Arrivederci is fab.  Especially the homemade gnocchi. You can't get much better than that.  The eggplant parmigiana is fantastic too and even the plain old raviolis are delicious.  

The portions are big, and it's always fun to order different dishes and have everyone share so you can get a little taste of everything.

The desserts are great too- check it out!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Italian. Try the ravioli or the veal. Truly exceptional. The atmosphere and service were excellent as well. You should come here."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit to this restaurant was with a Groupon and we said we wouldn't go back.  The food was overpriced for the quality, presentation and service were so-so and we found it the restaurant lacking in ambiance.  There were few patrons on this visit.

We were asked to join friends there after a concert in early Dec. because they frequent the restaurant.  Our friends were greeted by, I'm guessing, the manager who proceeded to boast about his restaurant experience once we were seated.  It was early evening and once again, few patrons in the restaurant but a few at the bar.

Our young waitress was only in her 2nd week of training and I could tell she was intimidated by the 'manager' shadowing her.  I choose to use patience with people who are learning their job because I, too, was a newbie more than once.

Without going into details, I will say that the 'manager' was so rude to the waitress while she was taking our orders that I asked him to please leave the table by 'going over there' (finger point) and allow her to do her job.  He did.

It took a very long time to get our food which left much to be desired.  That wasn't the waitresses fault!

Now, I'm sticking to my original guns and will not return to this place."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Parmigiana  was some of the best I have ever had in Scottsdale and Phoenix.
The  waiters, Giovanni and Eddy have been there about 20 years. I am amazed to see them every time I go in.
  The red sauce is definitely homemade and the owner is usually in the kitchen cooking. 
I have also had their fresh fish of the day and Cioppino. It was better than what many of the local fish restaurants make.  The wine menu and drinks are priced at a good value.

   I wish they had better cappuccino and espresso.  I noticed that they use a cheap home unit to make this and it definitely does not taste good.
   The tiramisu and cheesecake are made in house and have great flavor.  I will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent Ceasar salad and veal Gorgonzola. Had a good glass of house Chardonnay.  Service is super. Great local italian place"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better experience!  This is a must visit for anyone in the Ahwatukee area!"}
{"text":"the best
the owner eddie is wonderful
the server ann marie is the best
they give you a dessert for your birthday and sing to you
the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Our whole experience was terrible. We waited 15 minutes for the hostess to seat us and we had a reservation. We ordered right away and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive. The waitress came over once and said they were down a cook and they were very busy. She never said they were sorry.  I had the rigatoni with vodka sauce. The sauce was  runny and had no flavor. My husbands food was partially burnt. The waitress never asked how the food was, even when she clearly saw how little we had eaten. It was disappointing and we will never return."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have had in the United States.  Service was fantastic we never had to ask for anything.  Had the salmon appetizer and it was dressed perfectly.  For the main meal my wife had the sea bass special.  She said it was one of the best fish dishes.  I had the cioppino and it truly melted in my mouth.  We have been to Italy before and this was Italy here in the US.   A must stop if you are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"always delivers, fantastic food, great service with Giovanni and a great atmosphere.  My wife never wavers from the eggplant appy, but I try something different most times.  The sea bass this time was the best fish dish I have had in years.  Perfectly done and an ample portion."}
{"text":"used a groupon for dinner. Shrimp ravioli was soo yummy, was enough for two if us too share,service was great.. Would definitely come back here :)"}
{"text":"The food is very good.  However, the service was not. The waitress had a bad attitude and didn't bring us drinks and refills in a timely manner and it wasn't even crowded."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  First experience was lunch with the wife.  We had an intimate dining experience and really enjoyed our meal.  Seated at a small, cozy booth; the restaurant was uncrowded and we were unrushed.  We remember the bread as exceptional (I note at least one other reviewer found it lacking).  The food was very good.

Second visit was a weekend dinner and the place was packed.  Three of us this time and we got an awkward table straddling the threshold between the main dining hall and the winterized patio.  There was a large, loud group in the small patio type room behind us ruining the atmosphere.  The kitchen seemed stressed, our meal was delayed, and my memories of the experience are not good - but I do remember the food was fine.

My advice, go at an off hour - perhaps for an early dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great ambience.   It is obvious that the owner truly cares about the quality of food being served.  Very friendly staff.  The lobster ravioli was amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife & I went to Arrivederci in Ahwatukee last night to celebrate our 20th Anniversary. We were less than impressed, unfortunately.

We had been there twice before, as we love good Italian, and the restaurant is closer to where we live than other places. Here's what we experienced:

- The waitresses were very good and I don't blame them for anything. Let's get that out of the way. 

- The ambience is okay. We were put under a stronger light by the waitress station as opposed to one of the more romantic tables. But it was busy and we came in with no reservation, so we were ok with that, though it wasn't our first choice. 

- As we get into the food, understand that the kitchen was ridiculously slow. We were sitting there for 45 mins before we got our entrees (though our appetizer came out in reasonable time). We decided not to send our dishes back because of the fear of the extended wait time again. 

- We got the beef carpaccio as the appetizer, it was smaller than I anticipated ... But very good. So  thumbs up there!

- For entrees, my wife got the main eggplant dish & I ordered the Chicken Parm. We waited a loooong time for it. By the time I got it, the Chicken Parm looked and tasted like it was either left under the broiler or under the \"French fry light\" too long. The cheese was brown and the chicken was over cooked. The side of penne looked & tasted like it was right out of the box, but the marinara was nice.

- My wife's eggplant dish was a similar quality. There was a flavor we traced to the cheese on it which she didn't like. She actually said to me \"this is the first time I don't like eggplant.\"

-For dessert, we got the Chocolate Tiramisu. It was good, but seemed store bought. 

I wish I could say that Arrivederci over delivered and was wonderful, but that just wasn't our experience. The atmosphere and wait staff were solid (hence 2 stars instead of just 1), but IMHO, the kitchen needs help."}
{"text":"Terrific food and nice ambiance! The place was moderately busy and we were greeted with water and complementary bread.  

I had the spaghetti and meatballs and would order again in a heartbeat. Food tasted fresh, flavors were excellent and service was on point. I would highly recommend this classy Italian establishment."}
{"text":"I have not been here before and my BF thought it would be a good night to try. We were quickly seated, place was half full. Server was hard to understand but the wine he recommend and the risotto with seafood was amazing. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food and service were wonderful but it was louder than a longhorn bar on rodeo night. Ridiculous acoustics. My ears are still ringing. Way over capacity."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch there today. Service by friendly and welcoming Giovanni never missed a beat. Food was super fresh, nicely presented and the portions plentiful. I find the dining room to be very cozy.

I am a fan because I feel that Arrivederci is one of the best and most underrated of its kind in Scottsdale. This is not the first time that Giovanni was our waiter and he is absolutely fantastic. 

I started the meal with the smoked salmon appetizer with arugula and marinated artichoke salad which was wonderful. My entree was the penne with mozzarella, eggplant and shrimp. My friend had the linguini with olive oil and mussels and clams. Both entrees were great and the pasta were perfectly al  dente.

For the dessert finale, we had a lovely Illy espresso and the chocamisu which is Arrivederci's take on the classic tiramisu which was decadent but not too rich! I had the chocolate truffle which is a delicious concoction of chocolate and hazelnut ice creams. Both presentation of the desserts were quite well done!

All in all a wonderful lunch! Thank you Arrivederci and especially Giovanni!"}
{"text":"It's okay. That basically sums it up. I don't think it's a place I would frequent. Calamari and rigatoni were both really salty. The bread was really good and service is fine."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy lit spot for Italian food. I took my bestie here to celebrate our friendship. I ordered the pollo Arrabiatta i had a lit bite of my bestie's entree and I will definitely go back and try it. She had the eggplant Arrivederci.  The dessert we shared was the chocomiso and we did not like it. It was soggy and not tasty. So went back for second time and I ordered what my bestie ordered last and she did too. we both liked it and this time we went on a Friday night which was super busy and a 35 -40 minute wait.  We waited since It was the last day to use my groupon and didn't want it to go to waste."}
{"text":"So so so good!!!! Shrimp Di Avalo and meatballs are amazing! Always great food and amazing service. We typically sit at the bar but they have a great dining room. I love the ambience. It's a cozy night out. :)"}
{"text":"Super cute place with a romantic ambiance. The food quality was OK, our pasta was cold and the meat as well. Fish was overcooked and rubbery. We also ordered the fried calamari, it was chewy and looked like fish sticks, to top it off it almost felt like a deep-fried cheese stick.
Our food took over 40 minutes to get to us. The food was a little overpriced for what we got. I doubt we will come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is newly renovated and it's beautiful. Staff is very friendly, and the food.... OMG! Bathia had the gnocchi was the best either of us have had. I had rolled eggplant parmigiana stuffed with ricotta and spinach. It was great. For my fellow Jews, our waiter told us most of their patrons are Jewish and per their request they are open Christmas Eve. It's not the traditional Chinese, but thinking about it."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews so I will keep this one short and to the point.  We had never been to Arrivederci and had purchased a Groupon deal to use.  

When our bill came, I noticed we were charged full price for all items we had ordered when we should have been charged Happy Hour price for some.  Our server said that since we used a Groupon, we had to be charged full price for ALL food.  I was confused why I was being charged full price for Happy Hour items, I am aware Groupon can not be used to pay for discounted items (Happy hour) but we had ordered $60+ worth of regular priced menu items which was more than the Groupon Value.

Our server clarified that if anyone uses a Groupon, the owner mandated that every item ordered be charged at FULL PRICE, regardless if the Groupon value had already been met by other items.  She also confirmed it was because \"the owner needs to make up the cost of running the Groupon so we have to charge at full price.  The deal is so good, you shouldn't mind being charged full price.\"

We were over charged by $15 because of me using a Groupon.  The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt we will come back because of it.  Hope the extra $15 was worth it for you, Owner."}
{"text":"Delicious calamari, bread, Eggplant rollatini!  Would definitely dine again, best Italian place so far that we have found in this area.  Great authentic service.  Thank you:)"}
{"text":"Awesome local restaurant. Excellent food and service. Highly recommended.  Service was very good. Was traveling and on business but would definitely recommend this place. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! We had the eggplant sorentina, the lobster bisque and meatball ala franco! Fresh tasty food. Bread was so good I ended cheating on my diet but it was worth it. And to top it off, Max was so attentive and made our dinner experience a delight!!"}
{"text":"Food took an hour to prepare and then it was not completely cooked. We had been here two other times and the food was good. Not sure we will return. No apologies for poor service and we even had to wait 15 minutes for the check."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons we use Yelp, & other online review sites, is that we probably never would have discovered Arrivederci without using them. My wife had a special, the mini-meatball lasagna, and I had a lemon sauce veal.  They were exceptional.  The prices were reasonable and it was nice having an Italian waiter who really knew the food.  We got a bottle of wine under $30, something you don't see often in Scottsdale. The rolls served before the meal with a green pesto sauce were to die for.  To us, the ambiance was fine, actually quite nice.  We don't need a contemporary design, especially for such a small dining room.  A rarity in that we are actually excited about visiting Arrivederci again."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! I ordered a Caesar salad, which was pretty good, and I can't forget about the bread with the oil dip, yum! I then ordered the rigatoni with vodka sauce, and added in meatballs, which was GREAT! It seems very difficult to find good meatballs. Also had the cannoli for dessert, and that was also great! Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and got the worst table right at the door but our waiter Eduardo was absolutely FANTASTIC and it made up for being at the worst table in the place. He rocks and truly made that experience for us. If it was not for him we would not have enjoyed our experience. The food was great as well!!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of our favorite places to eat. Service is great, pasta and sauces are almost perfect, and ambiance is surprisingly great for a strip mall. They want to put mushrooms in everything, and their wine list is slightly out of date, but those minor annoyances can be forgiven with everything else being right."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a delightful meal at Arrivederci.  The eggplant appetizer was delicious, as well as the arrugula salad.  My husband and I shared the entire meal, including the veal limone main course.  It was tender, nicely flavored, the vegetables were crispy tender and the rice very tasty.  We finished the meal with their homemade pistachio ice cream with belgian chocolate and it was just perfect.  They also gave us their homemade lemoncello as a final course.  The serving sizes were just right and enough for us to share everything and be able to enjoy several tasty dishes.  The service was excellent and the prices were right for the quality."}
{"text":"Great little spot that we would not have found on our own but friends recommended it.  Hearty greetings when we arrived and were seated.  It was nice and quiet and we could talk and be heard without difficulties.
The Melenzana Arrivederci - a rolled stuffed eggplant parmigiana was unusual and delicious served with a pasta side. Our table also had the Vitello Limone with artichoke hearts and capers with very fresh vegetable side and a wild rice side - very good.  The salmon with honey mustard had the same sides and was tasty. We would all recommend this spot and we will certainly return"}
{"text":"I'm usually disappointed when I try new Italian places. I was happy that this place broke the trend.  From the live pianist/singer to the cozy booth and candle light to the jovial host, I was immediately impressed.  Then the menu...no crap, just the good stuff, the basics and the prices were pretty good. We couldn't wait to order, but we did. We waited and waited and waited. Finally I flagged down the waiter and asked if we could please order. It's like, \"Um, I would like to buy things from you. Would you like to sell me something?\". It really rightsized my excitement being put on hold like that. 

Finally the food!  YUM!  I'll get the chicken parm again.  It was the right size and delish!

So dinner was over and we were ready to pay. Along came the check and there went the waiter. Again we waited and waited until I flagged him down and asked if we could please pay. Again, it's like, \"Hey, I'd like to give you $30 + 20% for your...ahem....service.  Why won't you just come take it???\"  arg!!  Anyway, the restaraunt was great and I'll go back and hope for a different waiter."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Bern meaning to check it out for a while and finally had dinner here this week.  Service was impeccable, wine list was decent, food was outstanding.  I had gluten free chicken andushrooms with pasta... it was perfect.  The other main dish we tried was pasta with seafood, also outstanding. Their coffee was delicious and Limoncello was also very good.  Can't wait to go back...  quiet, delicious, relaxing.  Just what we needed to find in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Grew up with an Italian Uncle that could cook. Love tha attention to detail and the fresh ingredients. Don't hesitate to ask them to  prepare things the way you like them. They are always eager to please. Service is from the heart. Food is devine and varied. Definitely on my favorite list. Give it a try you'll be hooked on your first adventure."}
{"text":"A bad experience in every aspect.

- Slow and forgetful service.
- Host was MIA from host station, and waitresses were utterly confused and couldn't seat us...
- No one gave us menus after we sat until I made eye contact with a waitress.
- Lobster ravioli with crab and shrimp sauce had imitation crab and didn't taste like lobster at all but was $25.
- No one refilled our water until I asked.
- Waitress forgot the wine until we were 25% done with the food.
- The tables were so close together. When the waitress was taking orders from the table next to us, her backside was right next to our wine and food :( 
- Host almost crashed into me while we were leaving the restaurant because he's speedwalking around a tiny restaurant.

I will never be back again."}
{"text":"This place adorable! The staff and owner are authentic Italian, and you can taste the authenticity in the food. They use the freshest ingredients and I believe they make everything there on site (as in, all the sauces, etc.). And when they bring the check, they bring everyone a free lemon-cello shot! The atmosphere is so cute and it's very intimate. A great date spot or a nice place to take visiting parents."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here with a few of our friends a few weeks ago, it was great! We got to sit on sofas in what I guess passes for the \"VIP\" section since our friends apparently hang out there a lot. The only downside was the sub-woofers were under the side tables, so it was a bit loud. They had live music, which was cool. The singer was very good and super nice. 

We had the Caprese Rustica, not something we'd usually order but our friends insisted. It was sooo good, they make their own mozzarella, which is neat. We also had the Ahi Tuna, so nom! The Ahi was perfectly cooked and very fresh. The last thing we tried was the Calamari in Umido, it was pretty good though I don't know that I'd order it again. It's basically cooked Calamari in a broth, instead of your typical friend calamari. They have a pretty good selection of wine. We went with a Moscato that was delicious!

My only problem with this place is the entrance, I'm pretty sure they have to bribe fire/health inspectors. The bar is just inside the door and there are chairs lining the whole bar. Getting through there to the other side of the restaurant (where the bathroom is) when it's crowded isn't so fun. I'm also pretty sure if there were ever a fire everyone would be trapped by fallen barstools and the bottle neck effect...the food's good enough to risk it though!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner and they had a special menu for Easter Holiday. I ordered the Gnocchi with shrimp and crab, and my wife had the pasta Adriatica. When we first went in the table they attempted to put us at was extremely small and I asked to be seated at a larger table. The host flipped us an expression with attitude which I picked up on quickly. The waiter eventually made his way to the table and we ordered our dinners. He didn't ask us if we wanted salads or appetizers and for what it's worth I am glad he didn't. 

When the food arrived 40 minutes later I was ready to walk out. The dinner I had ordered had no shrimp and I asked the waiter what kind of crab was in the dish. Snow crab isn't even in season.  They used artificial crab which is whitefish and god know's what else. 

Stay away unless you live in Awatukee and your filty rich and stupid."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant twice.  We have not been disappointed yet.  The pasta is made in-house and it's perfectly al-dente.  I recently had the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was so tasty and delicious. I asked for more bread at the end to sop up my leftover sauce.  The service there has always been wonderful.  Friendly, professional and informative."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a charming host who escorted us to a cozy table.   Fresh baked rolls with a pesto oil dipping bowl was outstanding.

We began our evening with delicious green salad followed by excellent calamari, veal with portobello  and chicken parmesan.  
The evening was finished with some rich Italian ice creams and cappuccinos."}
{"text":"Very good food. The menu is pretty limited so check before you go. Good seafood, some poultry and minimal beef (which we liked...)Winner of the night was desert- the choccamisso - it was truly outstanding. 
Service was good and the hostess was welcoming in spite of the holiday crowd."}
{"text":"Dinner on Sunday evening - EXCELLENT!!  Fusilli Bolognese  and linguini & clams.  Both excellent as was the service.  Not one thing to complain about.  Pretty quiet when we arrived but when we left it was full.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This 5 star review is my huge thank you to Arrivederci and its staff for allowing us to host a 50 person birthday party on a Sunday before their normal operating hours.  That example indicates how nice the staff is and it carries over to their excellent Italian food.

Our party started off with 2 appetizers: the cheese au gratin covered Portabello mushrooms (unbelievably tasty!) and the caprese (excellent, but I focused on the mushrooms more).  We then moved onto a baby greens salad and finally our choice of either spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna. The meatballs were succulent, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best lasagna I have ever had!

The staff was professional, courteous and extremely helpful.  I look forward to returning to try out more from their main menu selections.  Thanks again, Arrivederci for hosting a great 40th birthday party for my cousin.  

**Tip 1**
Save time to snap a couple of pics next to the Ferrari Testarossa outside of the restaurant.

**Tip 2**
Look for that red Testarossa because the place is a little hard to find!"}
{"text":"This place was hand down the best Italian I have eaten! True authentic Italian food and the service was great!"}
