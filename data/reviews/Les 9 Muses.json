{"text":"I just came back from Les 9 Muses, and I must say I was impressed. Let me start by saying the staff is absolutely wonderful and very accommodating. The food is extremely fresh, it is simply cooked, and that's just the way I like it. Some restaurants put so much sauce, or garlic or dressing that it mask they actual taste of the food. At Les 9 Muses, you taste authentic Greek food. Lamb was amazing, chicken breast was good, maybe just a tad dry. Their Greek salad is to die for. Last but not least dessert (loukoomades) was melt in your mouth good. Everything was so fresh, even dessert. Prices are very reasonable. A must try."}

{"text":"Greek food at its finest, authentic and fresh. I came to this restaurant with business colleagues and had a great meal which all enjoyed. The owner prepared a special vegetable plate for me while the others had veal, chicken and fish plates.  Greek donuts for desert was a nice touch."}
