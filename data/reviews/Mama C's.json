{"text":"I love this place!  I just moved back to Pittsburgh after a decade, and it's still as good, if not better.  My friend lives near the restaurant, so we always order from there when I visit her.  I don't usually eat meat, but I have to admit eating a good sized slice of their Italian Hogies.  They have amazing sauce, and they told me the secret to the cheese is the right mix of mozzarella and provolone."}
{"text":"I moved to the area (literally 3 minute walk from Mama C's) back in March but have failed to pay this place a visit until today. Shame on me. The owner was welcoming, friendly, a little sassy, and bubbly. She talked to us the whole time while making our pizza. It is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. I think the trick is that they bake the crust first then add the toppings, giving it a fluffy, not-crusty texture. The prices are very reasonable and I will definitely be back. I cannot wait to try their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"I typically go here for their gyro sandwich, lettuce, tomato, onions and cucumber sauce...its the only local gyro placw i love..plus they have a great sauce really creamy. I've never tried the pizza so I can't comment on it but they don't really have as much food choices as some places.   Take-out only, no where to sit only stand..when you first walk in a large banner  reads no debit no credit no cell phones, they are a cash only establishment. Given today's time and the fact that I don't keep cash on me that often I hate running to the bank just to grab a gyro but i do keep a piggy bank just for them :)  They don't have any real side dishes like wings or soup or salad. So if you just want pizza, calzones or hoagies then this is a good place to grab it."}
