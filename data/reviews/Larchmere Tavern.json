{"text":"I've been going to the Larchmere Tavern on and off for years, but my most recent trip--a Saturday lunch with a group of friends--was pretty disappointing. Very few items on the menu appealed to me, the service was very slow (even though there were few other diners at the time), and the temperature was uncomfortably chilly."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a low-key dinner and drinks in a comfortable, casual environment.  Wait staff was attentive and quick.  Two things took a star away.  First, I got about five fries with my sandwich.  I thought it was the serving size, as another friend got the same amount, but then our third friend got about three times the fries we got.  That was just kinda weird.  Second, I checked the menu before going and picked what I wanted.  The menu they gave me there was completely different.  When I asked about it, the waiter casually acknowledged that they knew the online menu was TWO YEARS out of date!  It can't be too hard to take it down or update it!"}
{"text":"Having the Grilled Chicken Greek Salad. It has an excellent Lemon Vinaigrette dressing, fresh lettuce and vegetables and very tasty chicken. The bread is excellent. The music is appealing and played at a good volume. A very friendly neighborhood feel here."}
{"text":"Warm brie salad!  its amazing; have to say probably my favorite in town.  Great restaurant; sort of an older clientele so don't expect a lot of noise."}
{"text":"do you want a strong cocktail? this is your place. want beer on tap? sorry, none at this tavern. really great wings, but our burgers were pretty lackluster - not well seasoned and mushy bun. and those stong cocktails? that's all you can say about them. the old fashion appeared to have grenadine in it."}
{"text":"I have looked far and wide for crispy wings in Cleveland (not exaggerating, I've been trying places for months) and I've finally found them at Larchmere Tavern!!
Wish they had a better beer selection, but a solid place that's now a go-to of mine."}
{"text":"One our favorite neighborhood taverns. Friendly atmosphere, consistently good fare and a good value given the large portions. Three great menu items are the Asian meatballs as an appetizer, the warm Brie salad and the pork osso buco entree."}
{"text":"The place has a retro feel to it and u can grab a seat on a winter evening to look outside the window and feel warm comfy n cozy. Ambience, as I said is welcoming and that staff is friendly. We were hungry so we ordered one appetizer - Mussels and straight to the entrée - Pork osso bucco, Idaho rainbow trout. The food was delicious and the portions were more than enough for one person. We had to box out leftovers as we were not able to finish the meal. The only catch is that the place is bit on the expensive side. The bill for two people without alcohol was 50$."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I checked this local establishment out for the first time (despite having lived in Larchmere for a year) last night, and are now so excited to come back. We were in the mood for margaritas, so we ordered them--off the menu--and enjoyed then immensely, and even the value was good once the bill came! We both got that evening's special: a poached shrimp salad with egg, cucumber, Bibb lettuce, vinaigrette and aioli with fingerling potatoes. Again, not disappointed in the least! Followed up by a giant slice of the best carrot cake I've ever had, which is made in house by the owner. We had some special requests (sit outside with the dog, ordered drinks and sides not listed) and Larchmere Tavern took impeccable care of us. CC, our server, was phenomenal. We are now happy return customers to this iconic Larchmere establishment."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Great back patio, beer selection and really surprisingly great food. Must try."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer during porch fest. Place was mostly deserted but the woman behind the bar was very put out by our request to sit on the patio and have a beer.
On the plus side the young waitress outside was extremely friendly and upbeat. She must be new. She hasn't yet had her life force sapped by the older barmaid inside."}
{"text":"Fred, the owner and chef is just the best!
For years he has co-owned this place and it has had it good times and not so good.
I remember sitting on the patio Sept 11, 2001 and the solemn faces had this cozy place to relax and reflect on life!

This year, he revised the menu, added a \"cocktail\" menu and VaVoom!
Classic food at classic (means great) prices
Excellent variety for the meat eater, the vegetarian and the foodie
Wonderful wines
Bar for mingling with the locals and a separate dining if you don't want to socialize.
He even added music on Mondays!

Great revival of this place and Congrats Fred!"}
{"text":"So I've been a few times. The girl working the bar at lunch generally knows whats going on. I have fallen in love with the buffalo chicken salad. Its great. Place reminds me of the old Carl's Chop House in Detroit."}
{"text":"Excellent - old world style pub and restaurant. The dark wood and comfortable atmosphere puts you in a relaxed and friendly state of mind. We went on Christmas Eve before heading over to the Botanical Garden. Great place to go during the holidays as it was very festive.

The food was also very good. I had the Larchmere Tavern Burger. Awesome! It came with a sweet n sour onion jam with creamy fontina cheese on a nice soft brioche role. Really delicious and interesting. My wife had the salmon salad and really enjoyed it. If you are hanging around university circle and looking for a great place to grab a cozy drink and some great food, I recommend Larchmere Tavern."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food!  We also needed to return drinks made incorrectly.  Food arrived at all different times and never got my coffee drink.  So disappointed - we do
not recommend."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by this find. Looks like a standard tavern from the exterior, but the staff was warm and welcoming and the food was absolutely delicious. As an east-coaster I'm very critical of seafood and I was impressed at the care of flavor and preparation."}
{"text":"It's a diner with classy American fare.  The warm brie salad is fantastic.  It was a spinach salad with grapes and mandarin oranges.  The monterey club and walleye were both good.  Their french fries are pretty perfect.  Everyone at the table next to me got paprikash.  I'll have to try it.  The apple crisp was decent.  I'd go back just to have the warm brie salad with a side of fries.  The sandwiches and salads are 10-15$ and entrees are 15-20$."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and reasonable prices.  The chicken livers and bacon wrapped water chestnuts are \"to die for\"-literally.  Splurge and eat healthy other times.  Suggestion:  share the chicken livers with someone else and share another selection.  This will mitigate the guilt of eating the entire order of chicken livers yourself.
Service is good and groups are easily handled.  Road construction going on now is a real pain, but hopefully will be ending shortly.  It didn't seem to affect today's lunch business."}
{"text":"Liked it- despite the name, this is not a bar, but a quite nice restaurant . I had the banana peppers, which was listed as an appetizer, but I found to be fine as a meal along with a side salad. Another bonus was that it was quiet enough to talk.
Nice place, I recommend it."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped water chestnuts were perfect! I could eat 100 of them! The gumbo was also great. Love the vibe, very old school. Classic."}
