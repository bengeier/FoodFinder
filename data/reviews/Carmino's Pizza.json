{"text":"Delivery took 1 hr ,shop is 15 min. away depending on traffic,Del.guy was very friendly But Pizza or Pie  WAS Cold ,outside temp. at Del. time was 40 degree's had to heat it up in the oven to eat it!!!!! This was our first time for this pizza shop for us,could have done better"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because their pizza is decent. WARNING, stay away from salads and wings. I just paid $8 for a head of lettuce. The wings are edible at best."}
{"text":"The best wings in the Cleveland area. The Rush Inn in Lakewood comes close, but this is the real \"Wing King.\" The sauce is top-notch (we ask for extra sauce each time). And the wings are big and cooked just right. The pizza is great. We always ask for extra sauce and sauce for dipping, but we're sauce hounds. They also deliver to Ohio City which is well worth the $4 delivery charge (plus: the delivery bros are swell)."}
{"text":"If I can do zero stars I would. This place is not only rude and don't know their own menu, their large pizza is the size of little Caesars small pizza. The management is rude and their \"not normal\" according to the managers reasoning. I would steer clear from ordering from this trashy place."}
{"text":"Great wings, good pizza, and fair prices. Can't ask for much more. I've been ordering delivery from them about twice a month since moving to the area. The wings aren't breaded :( but the sauces are good."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great prices. Fast delivery.  Try the fried chicken.  Fantastic.  Never screw up the order. Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Carmino's is my favorite pizza place around! The sauce on the pizza is to die for. The sausage is the best thing ever because it's giant pieces of actual sausage. Not like some places where they claim they put sausage on your pizza. I'm a person that eats the crust and their crust definitely doesn't disappoint! It's a tiny building but definitely a gem! I love getting their pizza for birthday parties and everyone loves it! Definitely recommend trying this place if you never have. The rigatoni with sausage is awesome. I got it for a family birthday party and everyone asked where it was from. The pressure cooked chicken and the jojos however I wouldn't recommend. In my opinion they have very little to no flavor and are way to greasy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza, without the chicken and bacon. I know, I know, I prefer veggies. The broccoli was steamed, but  buttered & salted -- too much salt and grease! The crust was soggy and floppy, the whole thing too salty."}
{"text":"Carmino's pizza is great, as were the spicy garlic wings. Would have liked a little more sauce on the wings, but whatever. The \"large\" pizza looks to be about a 12-inch round...smaller, but priced bigger, not a fan of that. Little bummed when I ordered a \"large\" with 5 toppings, and it looked on the medium side...was hoping for a little more for 15$. Still good pizza, with good toppings. Best pizza sausage ever. 1 star bonus point for delivering to 65 and Franklin before the quoted time, and having online ordering. On that note, the online menu items should be more descriptive."}
{"text":"Disgusting. The wings were cold, driver was late. He was rude and forgot the sticks . very impatient and practically pounding on my door. I called and asked to talk to the manager. The best they could do was remake the order. I wanted half of the $40 I paid for  over priced and barely edible"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never gotten around to reviewing Carminos. Are used to live relatively close to this place and my wife and I would order it very often. This is a great CLE gem. Their pizza always has a fair amount of really good cheese and a rich sauce, I think it's the oregano that I taste. It's really quite good, especially on their thick but not overly doughy crust. We used to get their BBQ wings as well. We used to get them A Lot!    They've got great weekend specials as well as reasonable prices for throughout the week. Today I'm back in the neighborhood dropping off our taxes to the accountant so I'm grabbing dinner here before I have to head back into downtown. Meatball sub is on the way!!"}
{"text":"They would not delivery to zip code 44113, a zip code listed on their site. Apparently is depends on the actual address, not the zip code.  I think every business should be aware of who they are trying to reach."}
{"text":"I ordered from here a couple weeks ago and was very surprised that you can order online and they deliver to Ohio City ($4).  The delivery guy was super friendly.  Stromboli: for the price, it was kinda skimpy. I also ordered French fries and the amount was ok.  Maybe I would repeat and try something else. The menu is huge lol."}
{"text":"Great consistent food and service! My go to pizza place, especially when entertaining guests. Lots of options and specials for every day of the week. There is a lot of good pizza in Cleveland, but Carmino's is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had. I'm in the military and Carmino's is my first and last stop when I'm back home.  We've been eating here for over 25 years, hope they never close (or maybe they'll let me buy in ).  Oh yeah, the Stromboli is damn good too."}
{"text":"Best Stromboli in all of The Land! Soft chewy dough rolled around smoky ham, salami, cheese, a very robust marinara, & hot (or mild) peppers.  Small dine-in area with 3 booths and a long table for large groups. Coupla pinball-like machines to keep the kids occupied while you wait on the za. Pizza is above average with a Chewy drought crust, and ample well cooked (browned) cheese and that hearty robusto marinara sauce.  Did I mention the Stromboli?? Get one, now!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. Open late, fantastic solid pizza. Crust has a great flavor. The bbq wings are addictive! Love the online ordering function. I cannot say enough great things, it's the best pizza delivery option we've ever had."}
{"text":"Best sauce on any pizza anywhere!  Wings are good too. It's not a fancy place but who cares!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Real Italian sausage not that processed crap. Crust is awesome. Calzones are my favorite and the family loves the giant stromoli."}
{"text":"My family and I love Carmino's! Definitely some of the best pizza in Old Brooklyn. They put on a lot of cheese and their sauce is pretty good! If you are a cheese person, Carmino's is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I see most reviews on here deal with delivery; which I haven't dealt with personally. This review deals with the visit me and my girlfriend had for dinner in the restaurant.  The atmosphere was very nice and open and quaint. The service was average, but what sold me on this place were the quality of the food AND the value.  We ordered a small pizza along with an order of breadsticks and our total was around $7! That alone for a Pizza Hut or Dominos would be a good deal, but this is some high quality pizza we're talking here. The breadsticks were light and fluffy and full of flavor and everything on the pizza tasted fresh.  I recommend highly that if you had a bad delivery experience, go sit in for dinner or lunch because I think you will be pleasantly surprised. They get an A for me."}
{"text":"This place has been tossing pies since 1970 so I'm pretty sure they know what they're doing. Our first visit to the little shop on Pearl Road only served to further prove the point.   We placed our order online and decided to pick it up. Not because we didn't trust their delivery but because we live 5 minutes away and we didn't wanna get socked with a $2 delivery charge. Their menu is expansive for a pizza place. They've got salads, wings, stromboli, sandwiches, and pressure-cooked chicken. I think I even saw pork chops on the menu. The space is larger than you think it'd be. You enter beneath the marinara-red awnings from the front, take a sharp right and another left. The counter is right there flanked by a couple of little pinball machines. Around the corner is a dining area if the eating there thing is more your style. Now on to the good stuff.  The pizza at Carmino's is old-school. You're not going to find truffle oil or Peking duck on any of their pies and this is a good thing. Sometimes you just want a pizza. You know the kind. Thick, crunchy-chewy crust, slightly sweet tomato sauce, fresh toppings. It's a neighborhood pizza joint that wears its heart on its sauce-stained sleeve. A large pizza is eight slices and plenty for two with room left for lunch the next day.  The breadsticks, lightly buttered, dusted with Italian seasoning and served with a small cup of marinara for dipping, were soft doughy and delicious. The turkey and bacon salad was not mind-blowing but definitely more than expected - iceberg lettuce, sliced tomato, red onion, a couple of olives, crispy bacon and a few strips of deli meat turkey. Macaroni salad like mom used to make, simple, no-frills. It'll take you to a 4th of July cookout in January.  Carminos does it right. While I can't vouch for the rest of the menu's offerings (I'm not sure I'd go to a place like this to order fried fish or chicken) the pizza won't disappoint. Don't waste your money on that sauced cardboard that Little Caesars is schlepping nowadays. Spend a couple more bucks, get the real deal and support local business."}
{"text":"\"Try something new!\" I said to myself this afternoon. \"Surely there are some great mom and pop pizzas out there I've missed.\" I said to myself.   I should have just ordered Pizza Hut.  Ordered at 2 pm on a Saturday, arrived an hour and a half later at 3:30. A $4 delivery fee plus a five dollar tip. I ordered a taco pizza, thin crispy crust. An hour and a half later I got a pizza so undercooked that despite using a spatula, I couldn't even get a slice without everything sliding off. Sad. Finished cooking a piece in a skillet and the pizza still sucks. I also ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza which was... passable I suppose.   What is it with Cleveland pizza? It's a sad state of affairs. In other areas of this state, every corner deli has pizza that is better than most everything I've tried in this city. The amount of times I've received a pizza with an unfinished doughy crust (and I usually order well done!) is downright pathetic.   It's pretty sad when the Hut is the best option for delivery pizza in Ohio City. Sainato's is very good but very pricey."}
{"text":"Let me begin with the fact that I have ordered delivery dozens of times and the response to what I am about to impart was amazing...Ordered $50.00 worth of delivery and received sour cream that was expired a month ago. I called and told them that my son's fiance had taken a bite without realizing and it was bad. They offered me a $2.00 credit. I was incensed. I demanded to speak to an owner and met no better result. Needless to say the patronage is over and I will tell many as I can of my experience."}
{"text":"Pizza good. Delivery faster than expected. Ceaser salad is box of lettuce and croutons, disappointed. Can't believe I paid money for this salad."}
{"text":"horrible buisiness! long waits, undercooked and the owner couldn't care less about anything but his cash register. 4 years i've been a customer, even when the neighbors order i get trouble! my property is trespassed and i get nasty ness from the driver who doesn't want to park in street so uses my house... knowing he's not coming to my house. won't move so i can get out of my driveway! owner... he didn't care.. said so what... why spend $there? they don't care about customers unless your handing them money for under done pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint offers some pretty decent food. Pizza is great, sauce and the sausage toppings are very fresh and surprisingly quite fresh. Prices are ok. The customer service quality is ok too. Overall a great place for yummy delicious food."}
{"text":"Seems this is now our \"go to\" pizza place. Yes we order way too much pizza.  That aside, the subs are a good value for the price. Best amongst them would be the Italian, followed closely by the fish. Jojos are the Cleveland standard ones. The chicken dinners are a great value and always good. Haven't had a bad dessert from here either. Speaking of, the best is the chocolate outrage ($2.59). For some reason it only appears on the online order menu (which is afore mentioned disaster).   Monday wing special (10 for $3.99) is probably the best special around. Take note: the super hot sauce is really that. It'll get your attention."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good service. I wish my Pizza had more sauce since I've read so many good things about their sauce. They have good deals on Tuesdays where you can get two large one-topping pizzas and a two liter for $12.99 for carry out and half price pizzas for dine in. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"OMG!  I Love This Place    I was told about this Amazing Place 18 yrs ago, The first thing I tried was their Stromboli which comes with mozzarella cheese, ham and hard salami with a side of marinara sauce. I always order extra meat and a bowl of sweet & sour sauce because to me they complement each other very well.   At one point for serval of years I ate a Stromboli for dinner. I have not and will not try another Stromboli at any other establishment!. No one makes a Stromboli like Carminos Pizza!"}
{"text":"After moving to the Old Brooklyn area, we've tried a few different pizza places to find \"the one.\" Now, I can confidently say Carmino's is it!  Their pizzas are excellent, and I highly recommend trying their white pizza in addition to the standard red sauce options. We've also ordered meatball subs, pastas, salads, chicken wings, and all sorts of other great food items -- and have yet to run into a dish that disappoints!  Whether we need a night off from cooking dinner, or are looking to order in a filling spread for groups and parties, Carmino's is our delicious, affordable and dependable go-to. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"An hour and 20 min. for delivery and I'm only several blocks away. Room temp pizza at best. The salad dressing was warmer.  Small salad, 4oz. at most.... boneless wings gfs frozen. First and last."}
{"text":"BEWARE my experience with this place was very negative. Abnormally long wait times, incomplete orders, rude staff this place deserves 2 thumbs down. Waited nearly two hours for 2 salads!  I tried looking past the wait time and was getting ready to eat when I noticed I was missing the salad dressing. At this point I was highly irritated so it prompted me to call  the store to let them know how unhappy I was. This was a complete waste of my time as the manager this evening was rude and did not care one bit that he messed up my dinner. Never once apologized for the inconvenience. My poor husband started work at 10:00 p.m. with nothing to eat for dinner because it took another 1 hour 1/2  for the dressing. Once they arrived I told them they could take the salad and the dressing back and refund me my money."}
{"text":"Carmino's is probably the best Pizza in the Brooklyn/Old Brooklyn area. Their delivery times are inconsistent, and they are a bit expensive - but they use top shelf ingredients and that makes up for a lot."}
{"text":"February 28:  Ordered at 723pm. Told 1 hour and $5 delivery. Made follow up call at 853pm, told on its way. 926pm received call from driver for directions. Pizza arrived 15 minutes later. Cold food and grease over everything! Breadsticks doughy, not cooked all the way through. Wing \"sauce\" was wing grease. Pizza may be delivery but tastes like Di'Giorno. The one star is for the full refund we got today when we stopped in the store requesting one.  Nice, although the Manager never apologized or asked us to give them another try, but rather made an excuse saying 'Yeh, we were busy last night.'  One of the most disappointing pizza experiences ever. If the food was good it would have been worth the wait....kind of. But both were horrible."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this establishment now I know why it's been around for so many years it's great . I ordered a half sheet with 3 toppings excellent!!!! The sausage was really my favorite great crust , and sauce was the highlight . I noticed they have a dine in area looks like a classic pizzeria II will definitely try their other items . They have online ordering as well ! Thanks for the great pizza Carmino's!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Carmino's is delicious pizza. The crust is excellent, the sauce is decent, the cheese is also alright. My friend says this is his favorite pizza in town and the chicken bacon ranch is the best. I would recommend going there and trying some pizza there. It is very cheap and good."}
{"text":"This is the best delivery pizza in the Cleveland Metro area. They have delicious crust and the sauce is good. They have some good appetizers and sandwiches too. The meatball sub is especially tasty. We've been getting delivery from them for years and they rarely disappoint. A couple of times the crust was extra salty but that is out of dozens of pies I've had from them."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy Carmino's!! First of all we just moved from Oregon and received a coupon for a free coupon ... Not a buy 1 get 1 free coupon but just a Free pizza coupon Which is weird and AWESOME! I called the pizza in and they were uber friendly on the phone but that's cool. They were quick and to the point I arrived 20mins later when they asked me to, I wish it had been a little hotter kept. The man was sweet and secretly asked if he could offer my son a sucker which I said yes to and my son was very satisfied with his tootsie pop. We got home and hubby and I indulged!  Fresh cheese, meats (pepperoni and sausage), fresh sauce and the best pizza crust I have ever tasted! It was so good! A few weeks later we ordered another pizza and it was $10 for a large and it tasted just as good!! Can't wait to go back!  I wish the parking was better. The back area looks super shady. :-("}
{"text":"I don't enjoy writing 1 star reviews. I had such a bad experience here. Ordered for carry out. Told 20 minutes. I arrived about a half hour after ordering. Food was not ready. I waited an additional 40 minutes after arriving. Over an hour for carry out-BUT wait! The order was wrong. I didn't realize this until I got home. I called, they offered to correct it and deliver. I agreed. After another 40 minutes wait I called the store and was told \"it'll be there soon\" an hour after calling the order was delivered. It was correct but was not good. I'm so disappointed in the food and the (lack) is customer service. Especially when I called to address an issue. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! They have quick delivery and the Chx Bacon Ranch pizza is some of the best I have ever had. I get Carmino's a lot and I have never had any customer service issues, delivery time issues, only excellent pizza! Crust is just right, cheese is melted to perfection and you get a bang for your buck. I highly recommend sampling the goods...."}
{"text":"Over priced for store bought ravioli. The pizza isn't bad but it also isn't good. Horrible customer service, it feels like you're bothering them when you call, the food is never ready for pick when you show up at the time they said. If you get delivery and call to ask when they'll finally be getting there the response is \"they'll be on their way soon\". I could go to chain pizza place and get better service from a teen who gets paid minimum wage then a local business. Over all very disappointing."}
{"text":"Real, traditional pizza starts with the dough, and Carminos has been doing it right for decades. If there's better pizza in northeast Ohio, it's news to me."}
