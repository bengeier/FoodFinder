{"text":"Above average food, very tasty and quite a bit of variety. Third world service, should be an easy fix by hiring couple professional water and waitress instead using family members.
Will easily earn 5 stars. good luck!"}
{"text":"Had butter chicken and it was full of color. Not sure if its safe. It didn't go away even after we washed our hands with soap."}
{"text":"We had thought we would have sumptuous dinner after long time in an Indian restaurant but we were totally disappointed.We had hard time finding chicken inside Chicken Chetinad  and kofta inside malai kofta.Even the onion naan was not up to the mark. We had gone to the restaurant after seeing so much good reviews in Yelp but the food was really bad not sure if was due to Tuesday Dosa night or the cook was new or the item selection was bad. Even the AC was not working and my 5 months baby was cranky due to that. I am still having burning sensation in my throat."}
{"text":"Yeah have to taste the food in this restaurant its very nice and spicy foods especially ulavacharu in veg is too good and also the staff is simple froendly and  cool"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible. No one spoke to me, acknowledged me or even brought me water for the first half an hour I was there. Even though it was slow,  they still served everyone else in the restaurant except for me. 
Food is usually good, but since the service was bad, it lessened my experience."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this but the worst buffet I have ever had. We have been here twice before(probably an year and half back since we are not from this city) and we liked the food (especially rasam is the best) and now everything changed. The lunch buffet was very bad. The food looked and tasted stale, I don't think any of the item in the buffet is made fresh. Come here if you want to fill your stomach with rasam rice"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life!!

I hate to be so harsh but this place has horrible customer service - Slow & Inattentive. This is the first week and this place is showing up lack of attention or missing orders. We ordered our food at 9 PM and at 9:45 they came back to us saying kitchen is closed and they cannot serve biryani but at the end they bill us for the unserved biryani.
During dinner time in the whole restaurant they had only one person serving and we had to wait for 20 mins just to place our order and almost 40 mins to get out food ( with missing items).

Hope they improve their service quickly!!"}
{"text":"I think they changed chef ! Not that Authentic indian food for sure ! I have to lower my review on this"}
{"text":"We won't return - bait and switch tactics
FOOD - While the food was good and not too spicy with over 2 dozen choices on the buffet, they had less than average service, they did not ask once if everything was okay, did give us water in a carafe.  We were the only customers in the place for most of our visit.   When we asked for our bill, they pointed towards the cash register.  The décor may be nice, but the rest of the visit did not live up to what could have been the start of a long customer/restaurant relationship. 
SERVICE - Did not honor coupon (Groupon), we complied with all the fine print - I looked before we left and there was no sign indicating that coupons could not be used for buffet.  Tried to use it for lunch buffet at the Charlotte NC location on a Sunday.  Restaurant did not honor coupon, said it could not be used for buffet.  I even asked them to show me where the coupon said so - they could not find any limitations listed.  Not honoring a coupon that clearly did not exclude the buffet left such a bad taste that I don't want to go back.  If they don't want coupons for the buffet, then the coupon fine print should say so - changing the rules is just plain dishonest."}
{"text":"Idli! That they had these available made my trip. I took my mom, kicking and dragging at the mention of indian food, and as picky as she is and as much as she complained about the choice of food:

She LOVED it. She's had so many bad experiences with bad indian cuisine in the past that this was a great treat. She had the butter chicken and went back a week later for more.

I had the malai kofta - so yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the buffet about a week ago, we thought it was awful, Food was way to spicy. Indian food is spicy , but not this kind of Spicy! I have been to Indian restaurants all over the world and never experienced this level of Spice on a buffet. I UNDERSTAND IT BEING THAT SPICY IF I requested a personal dish and requested it be be very spicy, but never on a buffet. Typically buffet Indian food is Medium spiced. 
The service was awful when the restaurant was Spice Cafe but I could deal with it then because the food at Spice Cafe was SOO Good!  Now the food here is as bad as the service! Which is just plain AWFUL, save your money and time and go to one of the many other Indian Restaurant in the area. To name a few: Passage to India,Bombay Grill , Jaipur etc."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty specially people have to try ulavacharu biryani both veg and non veg ."}
{"text":"Completely excellent restaurant! Staff was very kind and attentive, food was very tasty, nice selection too and just the right amount of spice. I'd recommend any day of the week, and know I'll be visiting there again soon!"}
{"text":"Peacock is another example of delicious Indian food.  However, during a Friday lunch buffet, the service was poor.  My husband was almost finished with his plate and the restaurant employee already wanted to take his plate away.  The organization of the buffet also needs modifying.  One Indian guy (customer) just jumped in front of me as I was reaching for the raita.  It's sad when food is great and the experience is uncomfortable.  Persis is still all around the best Indian restaurant in the University area.  Please learn about their service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was formerly Spice Cafe.  The owners of Spice sold two of their Charlotte locations (the other location off Audrey Kell) to Peacock which is a small chain out of California.

While stopping by Spice Cafe in October to pick up dinner, I was told by the staff that the restaurant had been sold and would be opening as Peacock at the beginning of November.  Two gentleman from Peacock in California were at the restaurant and they both came over and chatted with me.  One said that the menu would change.  After I voiced concern, the other told me the menu would NOT change but they would be expanding the current menu and would be keeping the Chef.  This was the first red-flag that the fix was in lol.

I visited the restaurant their first weekend for the Saturday lunch buffet which was basically the same selection of food as Spice was known to have.  It was actually good.

I decided to place a to-go dinner order the next week.  WHOA... really nasty, perhaps the worst Indian Food I have had - and it took about 30 minutes for it to be prepared.  What takes 30 minutes to prepare you ask?  Their signature dish: Chicken Biryani and an order of Egg Masala.  I checked both dishes when I got to the car and they were both just over room temperature - not a good sign.

I asked for boneless Chicken Biryani.  When I started to eat the dish, I could'nt find any chicken.  After poking around in the dish, I discovered the chicken was on the very bottom, was cold and had a really funky texture and taste; almost like it had been scraped off of a plate of food served earlier.  I couldn't even finish the dish.  It was disgusting.

The Egg Masala was a just a hair better - which isn't saying much as the biryani was gross.  This dish was just about cold and just didn't taste good or fresh for that matter.

The best part of the meal?  The butter Naan.  Delicious when compared to the other two dishes.

The restaurant took a consistently good menu, cut it in half and changed the recipes (at least on the items I had).  

The new staff (aside from the one guy who stayed on from Spice) is quite un-attentive and do not look like they care much that you are there.

One star is all I could muster.  What a complete disappointment, especially when Spice Cafe was so good.  This location has not been good to other restaurants over the years so perhaps Peacock will suffer a similar fate?  I suppose only one could hope that the owners of Spice can, and are allowed to open another restaurant in the area.

Visit at your own risk - and hope that you don't get sick...

Edited to add:  After three 1 Star reviews in a row, several 5 star reviews have suddenly appeared!  These are in all likelihood either the owners or friends of the owners, especially the one reviewer who states (just a few days after this place opened) that they eat here all the time; Really?

Edited 04/19/18 to add: I don't generally wish ill-will on businesses, but there's a reason this place didn't last.  The owner sent me a nasty message accusing me of being a competitor.  I'm not a competitor - I just enjoy GOOD Indian food - something Peacock, unfortunately, couldn't consistently deliver."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service not so great. There was a whole side of the menu that the waiter stated that they didn't have. Is that even possible. I asked for my curry chicken to have mild spices, I think they didn't catch the mild spices part."}
{"text":"Good food and nice buffet on Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Buffet has been great in the past.  Tonight ordering from the menu.  Lots of recommendations.  So...will see how great it is during dinner......to be continued!"}
{"text":"Had their Guntur chili dosa and Chicken dum biryani! The most delicious dosa I have had in the US of A and the Biryani was reallyy good as well. We left extremely happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Taste of food is just Okay but service is extremely horrible. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Second visit to Peacock and this time for their Lunch buffet. Clearly, a better experience than the first time and hence my rating has gone up from a single star to 3. The quality of meat used (esp goat) is worth appreciation. Not many restaurants offer such quality. Biryani and fish fry have to be my favorite! Tandoori chicken was tasty too but cold. The food overall was either at room temperature or mildly hot, which marred the taste to a great extent and hence, I cannot rate the food very highly. South Indian dishes (sambhar & chatni) were very disappointing. Desserts did not please me much either (shahi tukra and ladoo). The service needs attention for sure. Only reason I'd go back (if I do) is for Biryani- the rice was so full of flavor."}
{"text":"Peacock is delicious. They have a fantastic selection of Indian food and very friendly staff. The portions are big enough to share family style with 4-5 people, and they have 4 or six types of naan. If I come back to charlotte, I will make it a point to come eat here."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Mike. I used to frequent Spife Cafe about twice a week. I'd like to state I am not a competitor lol. I'm just a girl who loves indian food and knows good quality. One day I showed up and right as I entered I was informed that they were shutting down the lunch buffet. May I point out that I showed up during the set scheduled spice cafe lunch hours. I was at first told I'd have to pay up front but they quickly changed their mind. At that point I debated leaving but I was really craving some indian food. What was served seemed stale and there was barely any chicken in anything. I haven't returned since. I've found new great places that were recommended by some Indian friends. I'll also add that we were a large group that day. One that actually tips well."}
{"text":"I dont know why this place is never as crowded as it the best tasting Indian food !!! They had both Goat curry as well as Goat Biryani in the weekend buffet !
The Chicken Tikka Masala was to die for ! Apart from this they also had fish fry , egg curry !! Also a ton of other variety of items that i've never found in ANY other buffet !! Also their price is simply unbeatable!!!"}
{"text":"Big thumbs up to the ulavacharu chicken biryani  have had it 3 times now within a week. 
All my friends liked it too.
I am lazy to type, so just this for now."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food! Ordered Peacock chicken OOA as starter and it was delicious with right amount of spice for an Indian. Main course was chicken dum biriyani and it was tasty too.. N ofcrse mango lassi is always the best drink with Indian food. Overall awesome experience!! Special shout out to Mr.Vamsi, our waiter for today!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 8/4/15.  With a friendly greeting, we were quickly seated with the convenience of having the buffet. They separate their vegitterian food from their meats, which made it easy to try and figure out what you are eating.  While most of the items I hadn't seen before, there were a few regulars who explained some of the sauces and sides.  

I wish I had written it down, but they had a bean and potato nut thing that was my favorite item!  I may have indulged a few too many times on it, but I used this as my \"rice\" portion. =) 

Everything had great flavors, and nothing was too spicy.  I'm never a fan of desserts, not a huge sweet tooth, but they had a mango pudding that really helped finish the meal with a refreshing end (I over ate...those green beans!)

It's a little pricey, but well worth it.  The Naan is made while you're sitting.  While I love to carb overload, I liked that they served two of us with only 2 large rounds.  Instead of being overly full on Naan, you can enjoy the curries!"}
{"text":"The food is good but that's only part of the experience. I felt sorry for our waiter as he seemed to be the only one working the front of the house. The air was on the fritz so it got a bit toasty in there. I probably won't be back without another groupon."}
{"text":"Menu and prices they gave us was different and little expensive than what was in website.
 Andra chicken curry was really okay, appetizers were okay but fried fish was too salty and really bad. 
Service was really bad as well. Staffs were always busy on phone and chatting with each other.
 If you decide to eat from here make it to go and do not get fried fish."}
{"text":"Honestly I would have given a 4 star because everything was good - food, service, ambience expect the billing.  So I walk to the billing counter to pay and show them the yelp check-in that gives 10% off on dining and this guy looks at my mobile screen like its the first time he is seeing Yelp and that I am trying to trick him into giving me a discount.  He asks to other guy - Yelp?  What Yelp?  Are we still on Yelp?  I was LOL and told them Yelp was the reason for my visit to their restaurant (I said this in the language the billing guy was talking to the other guy) and that's when I got his attention.
If Yelp was a person, it would have slapped the guy for asking who Yelp was.  ROFL.  So reality hits him and his face changes (since now he knows I can speak his language and understood what he was talking to the other guy in front of me).  He asks -  how was the food, give us a review please, that  its been a while since they checked their yelp page, etc., etc.,  I promised him I will write a review and here it is.  Makes up a nice story hmmm!!
Food - Was very good.  I found my favorite fritter here, its basically green chilli fritter, cut and stuffed with onions, cilantro and lemon juice.  Took me back to my country, specifically to that small shop in that street.
Vegetable biryani was very good too, great flavors and not too over powering masala. 
Worth the visit and yea may be I will go again.  Not sure! ;)"}
{"text":"The wait staff were friendly and all, but didn't seem to be run professionally.  A few guys standing around looking at a monitor most of the night.   Food was slow coming.   I ordered country chicken and I have no idea what kind of bird it really was.   Wasn't recognizable.  also had their house \"Peacock  Chicken\" and it was just ok.  Nothing memorable.  Rice was ok.  Naan was ok.  I'm afraid I won't be back."}
{"text":"The best South Indian food I have had in North Carolina. 
We ordered Guntur idli and Mysore masala dosa. Spices were to the point. The service was great too. 
Will come back for dosa buffet."}
{"text":"I just visited for the first time and had the buffet lunch. It was very good,  especially the Chicken Tikka Masala. They had about 20 items to choose from,  when including the salad, chutney, and dessert bar. I got there right as they opened so naturally everything was fresh. Once seated they brought me piping hot Naan. A carafe of chilled water was on every table. 
I recommend the Peacock Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about. This place has wonderful authentic Indian cuisine. Try the Butter Chicken. It melts in your mouth with just the right balance of spice and flavor. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been here for a lunch buffet - we tried calling in and reserving a table for a group of 8 but the person on the other end spoke little English and wasn't very responsive. We came to the restaurant anyway and found it to be sparsely occupied.

Walking inside the restaurant looks pretty neat and modern with great looking furniture and wonderful \"Indian\" paintings on the walls. There is also a bar counter towards the middle of the restaurant with a good selection of wines and beers. 

The buffet had quite an amount of dishes. Just by looking at them we were pretty impressed and started to dig in. Some dishes were really good and some were just hard and cold - totally let downs. They also serve you with hot Indian pan cakes \"dosai\" along with the buffet. There were about three different desserts - payasam, kesari and custard. Payasam was the best. 

The buffet is enormous with too many dishes and you got be careful not to over eat and get sick! Some dishes were made really well. The cost is extremely minimal for the about of food you have access to! At 13$ per person, I would recommend this lunch buffet restaurant to anyone looking for a good selection of Indian food with great ambience!"}
{"text":"We have been to Peacock for around 4 times now (mostly for buffet) as we live less than a mile from this restaurant and the food choices are pretty good with decent taste.  For a USD 12, I would rate the buffet as very good value for money.  Ambience is also quite decent. Suggest you guys try this out."}
{"text":"I am in a food coma of the very best kind!! My dinner here was excellent. I asked for the best vegetarian curry, and they made me an incredible red curry like I have never tasted before. So good!! The buttered naan was also very, very good. The staff was very helpful and attentive, but not intrusive. And the Kingfisher washed it all down well. 

I am a big Indian vegetarian eater and this is the best EVER!"}
{"text":"Change of ownership was great. Probably one of the best Indian restaurants in charlotte. I visit this place 3 to 5 times per month. I had a few bad consecutive experiences there (nothing to do with the quality of food, food is always been exceptional on evey visit). Peacock is a great resutant for lunch, I'm happy to be supporting it again"}
{"text":"All the stars go for the Ulvacharu biryani they serve. It is pretty good, nothing like you tasted before.

The service is pretty slow and we been there on a friday night. There was only one person running around and forgot giving us the silver ware, raita and salad. 

We have to get our own silver ware from the table. Had to ask for water and raita for several times. They need better management for sure. 

The other biryani items arent the best. 

Save yourself from asking for silver ware, raita etc and take a togo of ulvacharu biryani. Enjoy eating at home on your couch. #not even kidding."}
{"text":"Very good food with very good service.everytime we go there we are always greeted well.i specially recommend the natukudi biryani.is awesome and so is the mutton biryani.i have been ther for dinner as well as buffet and both were up to the mark . This branch is so much better than the other peacock branch .thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I went with my girlfriend and had the lamb saag and chicken vindaloo. Both medium spicy. The spice was a little much for us so if you aren't used to eating spicy food I suggest ordering it non-spicy. That being said, even with the spiciness the food was amazing. 

The service was also very good. If you are looking for a good lunch or dinner spot I highly recommend Peacock."}
{"text":"I always enjoy lunch at the Peacock!  Glad to see it seems to be doing pretty well. My fave is the Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for a buffet and I did NOT like the food. I have been here two times after that and I have to say, they have improved the quality a lot! 5 stars for the food now!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Indian place in Charlotte considering quality, price, and service. I come about 3-4 times a month. I would frequent the place more if my diet would allow it haha...but I have to watch my weight!

My favorites are their tandoori chicken and spicy goat curry! So good! I usually go during lunch for the buffet or take out. The guys that work there so super friendly and best part is the fresh naan they bring out for me. My takeout is usually about $12-13 a box. Not bad and totally worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their Dosa Buffets on Tuesdays are not to be missed. I have never seen so much of variety in a dinner buffet in other Indian restaurants. Also every single item is made to perfection. I am not too sure about their ala carte but dosa buffet is the best I have ever had in a while."}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite of the numerous Indian restaurants in University City. I come here for the buffet about once a month. There are always a large number of items on offer, including separate lines for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. It seems like every time I come, I discover something new that I haven't had before. For a non-Indian like myself, this restaurant is a great way to deepen my knowledge of Indian food."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is horrible.   Everyone outside the kitchen needs to be fired.  They need someone who knows how to run a restaurant.  Attempted to eat lunch there on a Thursday afternoon and was unable to do so despite the Buffet being completely stocked. They told me I couldn't be served because the chef had left for the day.   The more confusing part was three people in front of me proceeded without issue, who picked up their plates literally 10 seconds before I did.  When eating in, the service is every bit as bad as all the other reviews detail:

  - Extremely slow
  - Errors taking/receiving your order
  - Parts of the meal show up at varying times
  - Servers do not pay attention to their customers
  - Drink refills, may as well get it yourself
  - Nan - good luck getting it
  - God forbid you need your check anytime soon

When speaking to their management about problems encountered, they just look at you in amazement, very sorry very sorry.  Nothing changes...   How about fixings the problems. 

Update:  returned on Monday 3/6/17 @12:30 - hours on the door clearly state they are open, yet they were closed with no explanation when they would be open."}
{"text":"My husband I should have known something was awry when we walked in the door on a Friday night and the place was deserted. It took a long time to be greeted and taken to our table. Then, we were only given one menu and one drink option-water. The waiter took a very long time to return. We ordered 2 chicken tikka masalas and one order of butter naan. The server seemed confused by this and I had to reiterate my order again and he repeated it to me. My husband asked for a Coke. After ten minutes the waiter returns and tells my husband they are out of Diet Coke. My husband reiterated that he wanted regular coke. We waited over 40 minutes for our food. I saw the only two other tables there receive he wrong items or have to get up and find their waiter to ask for something. Finally we receive our food and get two orders of burnt butter naan and one order of chicken tikka masala. Then the server leaves and didn't come back for 30 minutes so we never got our basmati rice that comes with the dish or the other order of chicken tikka masala so my husband and I had to share. When my husband was able to flag him down and he came back he didn't even apologize for forgetting the other order! It was the absolute worst service I've had in a while. The whole staff seems confused. The chicken tikka masala is actually pretty great. But I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Went here on 12/30/16 for my birthday dinner. Staff was attentive and polite. The food was amazing! Everything was flavorful and portions were large. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner  , their a'la carte menu was very neat . Biriyani was very good . Service was good too . Keep  up the good work !!"}
{"text":"Ordered food here for a party of about 25 ..It was very good in quality and quantity  .!! It was pretty much sufficient .. Satisfied with the service.. !"}
{"text":"I like biryani here. 
Food is on spicier side, their dosa nights are good. 
Definitely recommend, especially for South Indian food."}
{"text":"Good place , Okay Okay food, good service and ambience, went for a buffet,Haleem is not so great, rest of the buffet is okay and totally an average place."}
{"text":"I've ordered chicken biriyani, veg biryani, chilli chicken and chilli paneer trays!!
The food was so tasty and delicious than expected. Chef was so friendly..we actually asked him to make some changes to chilli paneer and he did exactly the same. They even gave us warmer box. So, bug thumbs up! Good job! Well satisfied."}
{"text":"I would say best Indian food in Charlotte . Good variety of dishes . They offer biryani nights and dosa nights . Good tactics by business partners to get customers on weekdays . Must try for lunch buffet ."}
{"text":"This was a great find! We were visiting the area and found a real Indian restaurant, not your run of the mill stuff here. Excellent dishes, layers of flavors, delicious food. I highly recommend it."}
