{"text":"This place is effing disgusting. They are now called holy chicken. They forgot half my order and the mashed and gravy are highly processed. I get to work and it looks like what you would call beef gravy and there is no beef anywhere on the menu.
The  breading on the chicken falls off and it is way too greasy and they  forgot the fries and hit sauce. They have no communication skills. The kid at the counter was trying to look busy by going to and from the kitchen but doing absolutely nothing. I had to wait over 20 mins for my order and they didn't say one thing to me about the wait time. Do yourself a favor and quit the restaurant biz. You suck!! If I could give negative stars for this review I would give negative 20"}
{"text":"I ordered the popcorn chicken earlier today and it was REALLY GOOD. WOW. The chicken was actual chicken, there wasn't too much breading and the breading was really crispy, even when i waited 15 minutes before eating it. I was really happy with my purchase."}
{"text":"Garbage food. Was hungry thought this would be good. Waited a long time for cold food and had to eat with a spork."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Licken Chicken.

There must be a school nearby because as soon as I got there about ten loud swearing obnoxious boys (about 13-years-old) arrived.  Thankfully they were in and out in about 20 minutes.

I ordered the three piece Real Meal.  I asked what the difference between the dinner and combo was but I didn't understand what the cashier was trying to tell me ... and she probably didn't understand what I was asking (English wasn't her first language).  So I ordered the three piece Real Meal combo.  It was freshly made for me so took about 20 minutes.

The cost with a pop (they only had Coke and Orange Crush) was $7 even including tax (they only take cash).  So this had me puzzled considering the cost of the meal was $7.49 before tax and I don't know if the combo included the pop or not.

What I received was a box of fries and a box with four pieces of chicken.  Huh?  The fries were okay, nothing special.  The chicken is halal and was hot and juicy.  The pieces were a good size.  The battered skin didn't have a lot of taste but it was crunchy.  The chicken was good but not the world's best chicken, as they claim.

The cashier was friendly and chatty, though I didn't really know what she was saying."}
