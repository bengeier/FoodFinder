{"text":"I don't recommend this restaurant. We ordered a few dishes, which did not look like the pictures in the menu at all; food materials were not of good quality; the taste was mediocre at best. We will not return."}
{"text":"Literally the only person here.  20 minutes and dude won't come take my order.  On the phone the whole time.  I'm outta here.  Nothing to see here.  These aren't the droids you're looking for."}
{"text":"I mistakenly ordered from this place twice on foodora instead of 98 aroma. I realized my mistake the second time but wasn't able to get foodora to cancel my order. The food here is bland and the quality is low. The fried beef with cumin was dry. The fried rice with shrimp has no taste. The fried mussels was salty. I'm very disappointed and won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Been this place today and the food taste awful the service is bad. I know this place was Ten miles aroma. But it's still a shitty place."}
{"text":"I ordered off of Foodora and picked it up. I ordered the Grilled Rack of Lamb with Sesame and Sliced Beef and Ox Tripe in Chili Sauce.  The first thing I have to say is that they charge ~$5 more on Foodora than in-person. That's outrageous. I saw dishes that were $15.95 on Foodora go for $11.95... So if you do want to eat here, ordering off Foodora is a bad idea.  Otherwise, the food was not the best interpretation (i.e. Sliced Beef and Ox Tripe) did not taste like how it does in other restaurants - there's almost too much chili oil, and it was a bit sweet. However, it is what it is and made for great food at 1am.  The Grilled Rack of Lamb was not really a rack of lamb (I was expecting bones and all) but might have just been the belly - maybe some othre part of the lamb? It didn't seem like a rack. But it was still tasty with the dry seasoning they had (again, not the most authentic interpretation, but what do you expect at 1am).  Would I come here again? Probably at 1am and will not order on Foodora. Realistically, if I wasn't charged an extra ~$10 for my complete meal, this place would likely have been a 4-star location."}
