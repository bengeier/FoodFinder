{"text":"Today was the first time I found here. I'm a picky person in tasting or choosing a place, but really I like here. I tried cappuchino and chocolate pastry and I like them. It's  atmosphere is calm and peaceful ."}
{"text":"Miracles are essentially really cool surprises, and in that aspect, Sugar Miracles definitely delivers. An unassuming small shop along Yonge (between the Lawrence and Eglinton stations), We were drawn by how clean and bright it looked from the outside. Looking for just a nice cozy place to wait out a snow storm, we stepped in an entered a sweets wonderland. We had:
- Bee sting cake: Basically a vanilla cream pastry but done really really well. Generous dollop of vanilla cream was nice and thick, encased in a pastry that was equal parts fluffy and flaky.
- Chocolate banana tart: This was exceptional. Typically you can't taste the fruit flavours in these tarts but this one had a good (not overly strong) banana flavour, and the chocolate was very delicate.
- Strawberry panache dark chocolate: Very good consistency with delicate flavours. 
- Saffron pistachio macaron: Most disappointing one of everything we had since it could have had more filling and she'll was a bit too crusty.
- Almond peach tart: We got this to go and ate it 6 hours later. Usually there's a drop off in quality but it still retained it's freshness. Would have liked a bit more filling. 
- Espresso/Macchiato: Made with Illy so definitely an upgrade over other coffee places on the area.

To top it all off, this small family business has owners/bakers who are not only friendly and welcoming, but also clearly passionate about what they do... and this translates into the quality of the stuff they serve and the experience you have enjoying all their goodies.

With all the pastry/chocolate shops in the city, Sugar Miracles delivered an absolutely wonderful surprise in terms of its better quality and service. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are trying to cut down on our sugar intake... but Sugar Miracles is one of the places we definitely make an exception for. Their pastries and chocolates are consistently good. This time around, we got:
- Bee Sting Cake: Traditional German pastry with vanilla cream and a nice moist bread base. (Side story: Another customer was in line after us, we recommend she get it, and after she finished it, she thanked us since it was so good haha) 
- Sun Dried Tomato and Gruyere Cheese Quiche: Good counter balance to the all the sugary goodness
- Cappuccino and Hot Chocolate: You can never go wrong with Illy :)

While all the stuff here is good, another draw of Sugar Miracles is the place itself. We've spent a few afternoons here just sitting quietly, enjoying the place. And when you see it for the first time, that may seem a bit weird: It doesn't have fancy couches, is brightly lit, and is really small. But when you have owners who are friendly without being intrusive, and the music in the background is quiet and calm, and everyone who enters seems to be regulars joking around with the owner, it's just a great vibe to be in and enjoy.

So I would definitely recommend trying Sugar Miracles out. You'll definitely enjoy all the sweet and sugary treats, and the nice and comfy atmosphere you can enjoy them in."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

I went to this place on a whim after eating across the street and needed a quick pick me up after lunch. This was by far the best choice I've made lately. 

When you walk in to Sugar Miracles, the first thing you notice is how clean and cute this cafe is! There are a few tables, that you can enjoy your coffee or pastries at. 

On to the pastries! Oh the deliciousness!!! Oh the sweet sweet pastries! I was literally in heaven, when I tasted the apple strudel. So flaky and delicious! The banana loaf with chocolate chips and sticky pecan topping! Everything so moist and fresh! Perfectly sweetened without being overpowering. (I kid you not..pastries from here would be on my last meal list!) 

The coffee is Illy, (Italian), the Americano I had was pleasantly made. Not watery or too strong. 

Back to the pastries! (SO GOOD!) I also purchased a ladybug mousse cake to take home and share with my husband. It tasted like strawberry and was light and fluffy. It was so amazing. 

Go here if you are looking for delicious coffee and pastries!"}
