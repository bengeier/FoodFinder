{"text":"It is an \"old\" bar and I don't mean how long it has been in business.
The patrons are old, the atmosphere is old, the menu is old, the food is old and you will need a lot of old money to pay the bill
with respect to the over 60 crowd who just want to get out and have fun, this place stinks
3 appetizers, 5 beers and 4 martinis and the bill was +115 with the tip
service was poor to fair
and you will smell like cigarette smoke when you leave"}
{"text":"-1 stars. This place is consistently horrible all around. If you are foodie -stay far away. Local smokers and workers in the airport office park are the Clarks lovers. 
It smells like an ashtray. The food is way overpriced and it's very poor quality. It's a quiet place -mostly because of the shock of how bad it is. Bad"}
{"text":"I thought this place was very nice.  Food was very good and the service was excellent.  Live music on weekends, great dinner specials.  I would recommend for sure.  Have to find the place since it sits back into a office park, but well worth the find."}
{"text":"Warning, do not go to the bar unless you are a smoker. The smell will knock you over. The restaurant decor is very nice but the food and service was just mediocre and the prices are high for what you get.  My lasagna was stone cold and my husband's steak was paper thin. If you need a quiet place for a business lunch or dinner it is probably a good place as it isn't noisey at all. However if you want a first class meal, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading reviews, not far from hote), did not notice the 7 pm closing time on a Thurs. evening? Did notice the signs for bartenders and wait staff needed...not a good sign! Walked in to an empty diningroom....not a good sign!  Saw menu with entrees of $25-30...decided to leave."}
{"text":"The staff was great! The food was atrocious and overpriced. I would never eat there again. I left hungry. I'm only giving a star because of the lovely wait staff."}
{"text":"I need to come back here. Not because it was great, but because I'm still undecided. I didn't have a huge appetite, so I just went with a couple appetizers and dessert.

I ordered a crab cake, the shrimp and mozzarella and then a caramel crusted cake with vanilla frosting.

Loved the crab cake. Had a ton of meat and some good flavor. The lobster sauce with it was perfect, and didn't overpower the crab meat.

The shrimp and mozzarella was a mixed dish. The shrimp was a little big, as was the bruschetta. I don't believe that bruschetta should take me 4-5 full bites to get through. The prosciutto wrapped around the shrimp had good flavor. The mozzarella was VERY fresh. If it's not made in-house, it's made somewhere local. The bruschetta was a little burnt on the bottom, but then they doused it with a sauce that wasn't very good. Without the sauce, I like this app a lot. With the sauce, it goes downhill quick.

The caramel crusted cake also was pretty solid. It had a little chocolate sauce drizzle on it, but not a ton, which is good. It's a lot of flavors in one bite, so none of them can be too strong.

I'll give it three stars right now. Next trip to Pittsburgh, I'll try to stop in and taste an entree or two to see how it goes. There are signs of promise, though, and it's tucked away where you wouldn't expect it.

Only downfall is there was no one in the dining room when I went in. Since I didn't want to feel like I was in a scene from The Shining, I ate in the bar area, which still allows smoking. That made it a little tough at times, cause everyone was taking advantage of that!"}
{"text":"We came here to listen to the John Galt Trio. Its a nice little place but I hate that people can still smoke in the bar. The bartenders made fantastic chocolate martinis for my friends and I had a dirty martini with blue cheese olives...delish! I would normally not go here due to the smoking....if they ever change that my rating may go up:)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very quiet and romantic. The food was great too. Everything tasted like it was made from scratch and with fresh and quality ingredients. My only complaint was that the pricing was high and the portions were on the smaller side. Still the food was really good so it's definitely a great place to go for special occasions."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised!  Very good, knowledgeable service on a Thursday night in May.  The food was generous, flavorful and done just right.  Nice but comfortable atmosphere.  I'll be back the next time I'm in town.  It's right around the corner from the Crowne Plaza.

Note: I'm referring to my experience on the \"sit-down\" side (turn right upon entry), not the bar."}
{"text":"I tried the Clarks Restaurant on Friday for the first time. When you walk in there is a bar on the left and the dining area on the right. The bar was extremely packed, appeared to have a good atmosphere and for smokers - they allow it. The dining area was practically empty but set up nice. When you walked in it felt warm and was set up with holiday décor. 

The waitress was friendly and there are various options on the menu ranging from salads and flatbreads to pastas and more expensive entrees. We started with the fried zucchini for two which was more than enough to share with more. It was absolutely delicious - thin and lightly breaded. It came with a side of marinara  and horseradish dipping sauce. 

I was in the mood for pasta and asked which one she would recommend and she stated that the cream and crab was delicious. My friend and I decided to share it (split fee $3) and it came with a side salad. I must say that the split portion was huge but I was not a fan. To me it lacked flavor as well as color. It came on your plate and looked like a glob of white. I think that this was just a poor choice of entrée and am willing to give it another try since it has been recommended by others."}
{"text":"So it was snowing all day and most folks had head home for the day.  Clarks was dead.  All the better for our group since we were in town for business.  We were seated quickly (nobody was in the restaurant).  There were only a few folks seated at the bar.  

Our server was running all over the place but kept forgetting things (like salad and bread).  She was trying - and I know a bunch of guys can be tough on some folks.  I decided that I'd try the fillet medium rare.  We were told that there were no specials due to the snow.  I suddenly felt less special since I was there in the crappy weather.  Anyways.

The wine wasn't that great (not sure of the vintage).  The bread was great with the garlic spread.  The fillet was delivered, but over cooked. It was also not that warm.  

I finished the meal with a Macallan 18.  I asked for two fingers and it looked like they measured out two shots.  No rocks glass. Everyone's drink came in similar glasses.

We spent close to $600 and I think I'll skip Clarks next time.  I thought they'd really bust out the stops since we were obviously business folks and spending some dough.  Not so.  I'd hate to see the place when there are two tables or more."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch / early dinner in the bar. The service was great and the food was very tasty. I had the stuffed peppers which I enjoyed and the Clarks Salad with steak. Nicely grilled and the chipotle ranch was yummy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is always very good, I highly recommend the steak sandwich for lunch, so good. Top notch TV's to watch sports. Lots of parking!"}
{"text":"Surprised that this place hasn't been reviewed. Nice place. Don't go to the bar if you don't just LOVE cigarette smoke because apparently you can smoke in bars here.

Nice vibe. Good service. Good menu. Do get the stuffed peppers appetizer. 

The only thing I don't understand is why this place is here in the first place. You'd only go here if you were going here already. It's not the kind of  place you'd find on your own."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night because I was staying at the hotel near by. ( I don't like eating in hotels)
The restaurant was empty. Weird. I don't want to sit by myself in a giant room. 
Went into the bar and saw the sign that smoking us permitted. What? Really? Ugh. Okay well surely that can't be right. 
Sat at a high top table. Service was okay. 
Food was okay. Drinks were okay. But the fact that I couldn't even smell my food cause of the smoke was terrible. 
My cloths just stunk when I got back hated to put them in my suitcase. 
How does a restaurant get away with this. ? 
I have sent a letter to the state. Just curious."}
{"text":"Last visit to Clarks Still love the Bartenders  but the owner is a ass  we stopped  by a week ago and he bought the bar a drink except for me and  husband  full bar and he decides to signal  us out didn't want anything but was rude  honesty  get a grip  maybe spend alittle less  time drinking at the bar and learn how to treat people oh and by the way we have spent plenty  of money there but not any more."}
