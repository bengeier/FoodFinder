{"text":"Good beer selection and a nice cocktail list. First time for brunch but lunch is always good! Dog friendly with pet snacks"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour. You really cannot beat $6.00 pitchers from open until 6pm. They have a great local beer selection. I highly suggest the Mr. Pineapple beer on these hot Arizona days. Food is above par, but not the best bar food I've ever had in my teavels. For the most part the staff is great. Overall maybe one bartender that wasn't too friendly (but it could have just been me). Atmosphere was upbeat, good music but not too loud. I would recommend this place hands down."}
{"text":"There were four customers sitting at the large bar but the female bartender seemed to be ignoring us.  I ordered the cheeseburger and fries and u watched the kitchen as my order sat under the heat lamps until the bartender decided to bring my plate to me (too long).   After my plate was delivered the bartender NEVER asked how it was. The customer sitting next to me had to wait to get more salad dressing while the bartender checked her phone.  Lack of attention by the bartender really set me off, she must have had a bad day, she never smiled and looked put out when I asked about happy hour and instead pointed to the menu and said \"it's all right there\"."}
{"text":"Very good food, but very busy, and i recommend that you get there early. The outdoor space is very nice. Misters, bean toss, ping pong, etc. The entertainment is very well done. There is always something to do, so your not bored all the time! The indoor space is big. Many tv's and very nice. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees! I've been to both locations and had great experiences at both. Good beers and good food. I've tried the BBQ Burger and the Mac Del Mar, which were both excellent choices! Super laid back vibes. The patio is beautiful and also dog friendly, which is a huge bonus. The service was pretty good. But watch out, this place can get super busy and super loud! Went for dinner with the husband and we could barely hold a conversation because of the noise level. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I'll definitely continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Beer was very good. Kid and dog friendly. Sat outside nice weather and had heaters. Went for lunch/brunch. Husband had the BBQ burger which was recommended in other reviews. It was huge and he liked it. I had the monte cristo off the brunch side which was made from the French toast which was great. The sandwich was huge also. Kid menu is the usual items. Huge beer menu which includes local beers. Had the orange blossom loved it. For dessert had the apple pie which was good my daughters cleaned the plate. Would go back next time on the area."}
{"text":"I was REALLY excited to go to OSHO for the first time. After searching the entire restaurant for the hostess stand, we got seated right away. Our server arrived immediately and took our drink order. Drinks came out fast and were delicious. The server asked if we were ready to order but with being there the first time and trying to decide from such a delicious looking menu, we asked to look over everything for a minute. The server left and we made our choices from so many great options. After sitting there for about 15 minutes trying to find him again, we asked a different employee if he could find our server. (We had been watching our server clean the glasses behind the bar.) The gentleman went and found him as we watched. We continued to watch our server clean glasses for another 3-4 minutes before he finally decided to come out to take our order, but at that point it was too late. We decided on a similar restaurant in the same parking lot.  I am extremely disappointed in our experience as I have heard great things about OSHO but it will be very difficult to go there again. We will try their other location and see if the service is better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love love this place!! We go once, sometimes twice, on the weekends for brunch. Their mimosas are THE BEST hands down I've ever had anywhere! I've brought all my friends and coworkers for mimosas and got all of them hooked! Brunch food is great, however lunch/dinner food is just okay (hence 4 stars and not 5). We love the environment at the PV location and always bring the pups. The servers are awesome and very friendly. It gets quite busy during brunch but we've never had to wait more than 15 mins to be seated. Sometimes the wait for food and drinks can be a little long, but it's such a fun place we don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Best dog friendly place in Phoenix. Very aesthetic atmosphere and friendly environment!"}
{"text":"Great food, yummy appetizers, and tacos!  The Brisket sandwich is a top seller and we agree!  Steak tacos are a must and if you want a lighter meal, go for the salads!  Service is always consistently good, staff is friendly and attentive. There are many sports bars in Scottsdale to choose from, put this one on the top of your list!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Don't come here if you are trying to watch a game. Came to watch a playoff game and couldnt even see a tv. The Gila monster was disgusting. Didn't even taste like anything. Not worth the $9. Also the pretzel platter was nothing special."}
{"text":"My Wife and I ate here for dinner. They had a great selection of beers and it was awesome that we could do different 'tasters' of each of the beers to do a sampling. Had a salad with Ahi Tuna and the Turkey Sandwich which was delicious! I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for a good beer and good meal."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times with our dog and we love it. They are dog friendly. They have this great all-you-can-eat bbq on Sunday afternoons that is killer. They will even give you a to go box!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We came in and sat in the bar area. There was 6 of us at the .Brennan was the server very was fantastic. He placed out order the female kichenanager I assume did not read the check and rwo.of our entrees did not come out.as the four of us ate dinner the other two who ordered a salmon blt and a turkey burger waited. The four of us were done. We asked to see the mangaer . 20 minutes we waited for the general.manager to come over we asked what he was gonna do. He proceeded to tell us how he could not get over because he was clearing and bussing a table. When they asked to have 2 drinks comped he said that was a little much but he would go ahead and take care of the two sandwiches. So as the 5 of us are general.mamagers in the restaurant industry and one regional what do you think is his bonus. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste yourtime. Or find better leadership."}
{"text":"Son & I came in for the Sunday Afternoon BBQ special.  the Sunday special is 3 different BBQ meats; so we selected this over 4 Peaks for some quality Father/Son time.  Place was dead - first bad sign  So we order up and the food is quickly brought out - I have no issue with the service.  I have to be blunt... 2 of the 3 meats were completely inedible!  We paid our bill -politely tipped out and walked over to 4 Peaks (same parking lot) for some burgers and oh the nachos (add pepperjack cheese for an added kick)!  I was very disappointed but one star for service and one star for the décor. Zero for the Food. will never go back"}
{"text":"ZERO stars if it was possible. I rarely write reviews. But the service and the way this restaurant handled their COCKROACH situation is just ridiculous. If we weren't meeting friends ...we would have definitely complained b/c this is not okay for any restaurant.   First of all, They had giant cockroaches INSIDE and outside the restaurant. 2-inch long flying cockroaches. We first saw a cockroach while sitting outside. Okay....I GUESS it could happen since we were outside. (The cockroach was on our friend's arm at one point by the way!) When we saw it kept crawling around us, we eventually moved inside. The waitress laughed it off when we were outside...But then there was another cockroach that ran across our back while we were sitting inside. THAT was definitely not okay.   As if it wasn't disgusting enough, none of the workers or any manager came by to check on us....nor did they say much/acknowledged the fact that there are cockroaches....KNOWING that it's now inside the restaurant. They can hear us, but they basically tried to ignore it until we literally jumped out of our seats. The only thing they said was... we have outdoor seating, the door is open, there's nothing much we can do.   Seriously??? I think that's what pissed us off the most. I'm sorry, but that kind of answer is not acceptable. Also isn't this some kind of HEALTH CODE VIOLATION? We're from Chicago. We've been to plenty of places with outdoor seating. Never have we seen any cockroaches inside (or outside) of any restaurants.   It also cannot be an Arizona thing. We love it here. Everything is outdoor. We've eaten at so many outdoor seating places...We stay at hotels with outdoor (ground floor) balconies where people eat outside, and not once have we seen anything like this.   Their service is horrible considering the situation. No comps, no checking up to see if we're ok. And the on top of that, I find out AFTER we get the bill that she charged me $3 for a dipping sauce (which I did not eat b/c we had to move our table). Which she failed to mention that there was an extra charge. We spent almost $150 there...what made me even more mad is that I didn't know my friend already tipped her for both of us, so I also tipped. Argh. Our friends were being nice about it. But this restaurant did not deserve any of it.   We didn't want to say too much at the time b/c we didn't want to ruin our time with friends. But seriously... No apologies ...as if it was a normal thing for them to have cockroaches hanging around there. Super effed up. It's disgusting. If you can't control roaches inside your restaurant, what the hell is in your kitchen then??"}
{"text":"Colton(bartender) is the man. They couldn't fill my pitcher so I got a beer on the house. Also the happy hour deals are really good, $3 for bar bites and they're good sizes. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group of friends. Luckily I work right down the street because the place filled up fast after 5pm. They only have 2 of their own beers on tap. The Hoppy IPA is amazing, perfect amount of bitter and a nice clean finish. I do like the selection of beers that they have on tap of both local and national microbrews and pitchers are half off until 6pm.  The Steak & Fries are so good. The fries hold the juice from the steak and the sauce that is on top is delicious, my only complaint is there wasn't enough sauce or cheese. The AZ Burger was perfect in every way! The best burger I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Came here from out of town on a Monday night. Nice place and pretty empty at 9pm so we sat on the patio to enjoy the AZ warmth. Ordered our food and drinks: two beers and an entrea. The waitress was nice enough to bring me a taster of two IPAs I was debating on. I chose, and waited... And waited... And waited. Didn't see the waitress for a while before I reminded her of my order. She apologized, acknowledged it was her fault, and left to grab the beer. Then I waited... And waited... And waited... Finally beer! Woot! At this point we were done with the entrea so I was drinking the beer on its own not bad but I wanted something to munch on. So I ordered the wonton app, and waited.... And waited...and waited. And Nothing... So we asked for our check. The waitress went to the bar as if getting the check but then had a conversation with the bartender. So I waited... And waited...and waited...I would have understood if the bar was poppin but we were one of three parties in the entire restaurant. I'm not fond of leaving negative reviews but the service was almost painful but the food was yummy. Sorry OHSO"}
{"text":"Great food and Beer! Nice music and ambiance. Friendly staff and fast service. Salads and burgers are great."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for brunch and was incredibly disappointed. The bench of the table we were seated at was covered in food crumbs which I had to brush off myself--mild annoyance, but okay, not too big a deal. Then they brought out waters with cucumber wedges in them, which normally is a nice touch, but the water was so terrible that the cucumber couldn't save it. Thankfully though, I had my own water, so I could overlook that too.   Looking over the menu we decided to try the brunch special which includes a meal and a beer or mimosa for $10. We waited a while for the waitress to come by, and when she finally did, she wasn't very personable at all (didn't even give us her name). We put our orders in, and when the drinks came out, I noticed the rim of my mimosa glass was covered in lipstick smudges. Gross! We got the waitress's attention and she went to take care of it, but the second one she brought out was also dirty, not only with lipstick, but also some weird brown crumbs stuck to the glass. We asked if they had just wiped the glass out, and she said that they had made a whole new drink, but that it's really dark where they do the dishes so sometimes you will get lipstick on your glass, as if that's somehow okay or to be expected? No thank you!  At this point I was so grossed out that I couldn't make myself drink it, and was weary of eating anything there at all, but since our order was already in, I decided to soldier through it.   The food when it came out was mediocre at best (OHSO Classic and Quiche Lorraine); the only part I could say I actually enjoyed was the potatoes.   After the meal, we had to wait a while before the waitress brought the bill, and when she finally showed up, we asked to talk to the manager. We told him about the dirty glasses, and all he could muster was a pretty insincere \"oh, sorry about that.\"  No offer to take the untouched mimosa off the meal or anything.   Needless to say, we won't be back again and will stick to the Big City Bagel place next door. I hope for these guys sake that they learn how to properly wash their dishes and handle customer complaints, or else I don't see them being around very long."}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with their $10 Sunday beer/mimosa brunch. I'm all for great food and an even better deal and I'm also a brunch fanatic! Even took my mom and family here for Mother's Day, she loved it! Great service and highly recommend the Orange Blossom beer!"}
{"text":"We loved the original OHSO and were so excited when a new one opened up close to our house. Unfortunately, the service at the new location is poor. We have tried several times just hoping they would get better, but it continues to be lackluster! We love the beer selection and the food isn't bad. Plus they allow dogs! The lack of service overshadows all the good :( Please get better OHSO we desperately want to love you!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce had so much blue cheese that they should rename it to a blue cheese chicken sandwich. The side was like a jalapeño grits and was called jalapeño pallenta but should be called mush as it was awful. Service was good and beer was good as well but don't eat here."}
{"text":"Prefer the Scottsdale location over the Shea location food is pretty good I've had salad sandwiches appetizers.. beer selection if you love your IPAs is pretty decent"}
{"text":"The new extended bar is amazing and Jimmy was great at beer recommendations as I hadn't been in for a while and am kinda of picky with craft beer. I had the AZ burger and would definitely order it again. All around great experience- we will be back!"}
{"text":"I want to love OHSo...great atmosphere, close to home, dog love, friendly staff....HORRIBLE food! I have tried...eaten there 5 times, it just keeps getting worse. Please, change your menu and get a better chef. The beer is good"}
{"text":"Inside is really beautiful. You can tell they put a lot of work and money into it. The service wasn't the best, our waitress gave us an empty bottle of ketchup (not sure how you can't feel that it's totally empty) and didn't come anywhere near our table the entire time we were eating, so in a burger place with fries as sides, we had no ketchup. The food matched the service. We started with the chips and Guac, and the chips are paper thin, so of course they had no chance of standing up against scooping. I got the bbq burger, and the bbq sauce ruined it and carried an odd flavor. Not really down to spend another $50 here again."}
{"text":"We're always at WestWorld for horse shows, so this is very convenient, way up in North Scottsdale.  (right next to our favorite bagel place)  We're not interested in the distillery part, so this may not be a complete review.  But the food was excellent and the staff friendly and attentive.  We ate outside in the cool desert air, but the heaters kept us plenty warm.  A couple of us had the special mac-n-cheese recipes, which were both fantastic.  Everyone else really liked their food as well - we will definitely be back next time we're in town..."}
{"text":"Went to OHSO (FLW &101) again last night. Love this place! Everytime I try a different burger and I take home 1/2 for lunch the next day. Oh sooooo many beers too!  Great food and really nice place to hang out with friends. The staff are great and seem to love working there as much as we love eating & drinking there.  OHSO could stand for O=original, H=habit forming, S=satifying, O=outstanding. Wait does it? Anyway, I'm oh sooooo glad it's here!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! We had our two doggies with us and they were welcomed and treated so well by everyone! The atmosphere and food is unbeatable. My new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Let's get right to it.  I have no issues with OHSO as a whole and I hardly leave negative reviews, but my experience was unpleasant, and slightly uncomfortable. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by and grab a bite to eat. Though it's super hot outside, so we decided to sit at the bar since there was a lot of room.  We ordered our food and she ordered her drink, though I didn't get anything I wasn't brought water nor offered it the entire half hour I was there. Others around me were getting refills and being checked on frequently.   He also had some of his friends come in which is great for him but unfortunately there wasn't enough room at the bar for all of them to sit and unfortunately for us, we were ignored the whole time while he hung out and engaged in some light banter with his pals. I could tell by looking around that there was a couple others that weren't very impressed either. We decided to cut the visit short and be on our way.  We asked for the check, and as soon as he handed it to us he yelled across the bar to his friends that our seats will be open soon.   Great food and compliments the Sonora Village center very nicely.   Though we will be visiting the Paradise Valley location going forward."}
{"text":"This place is normally great. I'm not sure what happened to the big fluffy square waffles, but they must of decided that eggo waffles and kraft mac &cheese were more appropriate for brunch with Scottsdale prices. Apparently they have put food margins ahead of quality. Thank goodness Four Peaks is next door. #store bought  #a/c please"}
{"text":"Service was good.. Fun atmosphere. Food no no no. Shrimp tacos had a bad fishy taste. Breakfast sandwich was simple and bland."}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday brunch spot!  Biscuits and gravy was delicious. We also had the Pork Wings which are pork shanks that were slow cooked and tender but crispy on the outside and came with tangy wing sauce and BBQ sauce.   Their Bloody Mary was really good and had a piece of their homemade beef jerky in it.    They also have a great patio with misters and a big fan for hot days."}
{"text":"Was trying to find a place nearby with a late night menu and stumbled upon this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  Their kitchen is open until midnight.  We went on a weeknight around 11 pm.  Service was good but the place was kind of empty. We stuck to the After Dark menu (10 pm-12 am) and tried the Pretzel & Cheese, Crab Wontons, and the Thai Hummus.  Each were $3 . . . bargain!!! Liked the first two but the Thai Hummus was just okay. Tried the Sangria as well which I liked.  The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool and they have a great patio that is pet friendly which I'm sure is really nice during the cooler months.  Will head back soon to try their Sunday Backyard BBQ."}
{"text":"O.H.S.A. is an outstanding place to have a great meal, local brew, meet up with friends, listen to music, etc! The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and provide excellent service! Cale and Nicole served me the Good Vibrations IPA and a wonderful grilled chicken dinner with asparagus. I highly recommend giving this location a visit. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Rude mgmt (Wyatt). You'd be better off going to Four Peaks next door.  Burger was pink so we asked for a new one. Ignored my 3 different servers over the course of 20 minutes. They did bring a new burger... After we waited for a while and at this point we just wanted to leave. The waters were empty the majority of the time. Manager came out and was not accommodating about the poor service. He was argumentative and raised his voice. We brought up the point that several different staff members had stopped by so there may have been a lapse in communication. He responded \"we are a team here and that's how all restaurants work. We brought you a new burger so what else do you need.\""}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and love riding our bikes to OHSO for their friendly and knowledgeable staff, delicious food and great outdoor patio. Oh, I forgot to mention the best part, they're dog friendly! My only suggestion would be to improve the bike parking. Other than that, its a winner in my book."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here! Love bringing my dog in and sitting on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner for the first time and loved it. Friendly service and delicious food. Had the Brisket Sandwich and it was huge! Pretzel Board is another do-not-miss dish. Great beer selection at good prices."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by this place because I was in town for business. I didn't know what to expect but the waitress was super friendly and helpful and suggested the very delicious steak and fries. She also made suggestions on what other sauces would go well with this dish. The entire staff was friendly and attentive and food tasted great. Plus, they also have a bunch of different beers on tap that I was able to try tasters of. My only regret is that I came after happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've gone here probably the most since moving to Az. The food is on point. The beer is great.  They are dog friendly so the German Shepard always comes with us.  No better place in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of ohso. I think its so great that I can bring my pups!  I Will say I was not impressed with the qaulity of the food for how pricey it is. I got the mac del mar, it was $15. It was basic mac n cheese with barely any cheese. It had like 2 peices of shrimp and some green onions on top.  I just feel like the price is a little too high. Thats why I rate it a 3 star. Ill try going once more for brunch!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends for burgers and beers. Good selection of local beers and the burgers were good. I personally had a cheeseburger with green chilis which was very good. Great patio for drinks outside and local beers. Perfect place for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Really good seafood Mac & cheese. I'm not a drinker so don't know how the alcohol is compared to other places. I don't think it's a destination spot for me but was good none the less."}
{"text":"My first time at O.H.S.O. and it was a good experience. We had the beer brunch, which was a great deal with delicious food. The biscuits and gravy were great. The atmosphere is fun and the patio is superb.   My only negative was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to know much about the menu and told us one price for a side and then charged us more. She also didn't ask how we wanted our eggs cooked, so my partner wasn't keen on the scrambled. Oh well, nothing awful, but definitely not a bonus for the place.  I will definitely be back and come for brunch, just will look for a different server."}
{"text":"Interesting place. But not distilling yet. Big downer. Putting it out there and not being able to get some now is a big draw back.  And they call it a craft brewery. Well. No brewing on site either. Beer list is good but no brewery.  Menu seemed uninspired. Burgers and salads and Mac ad Chz.  Gonna call first before coming back to see if they have 'stilled spirits."}
{"text":"John was awesome, and Derek was a super sexy beer man. Me and the lil tina had a great time checking the new place out! And you know, Summer, running the place like a boss!"}
{"text":"Great time and place! Food and drinks were awesome! Our server, Melissa, was friendly and helpful. Happy to have this location open now, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, food is pretty good, the beer is great and the doggie biscuits and friendly patio make it worth the 5th star."}
{"text":"The food isn't great, it's ok. I got the fish tacos. I thought they were over dressed and the fish didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Had the wedge salad and the steak and fries appetizer. REALLY GOOD!  Fun casual atmosphere with the football games on five TV's. Chris our waiter was very quick to bring our drinks and food. Will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had the steak fries they were delicious! I am only giving it four stars though because their pricing is a bit expensive it was $14 for steak fries and they were a bit light on the steak for that price.. But I also love how it's dog friendly! The service was great too! They gave my dogs dog treats and water which is so thoughtful! I will be back to try more food! With the dogs of course!"}
{"text":"My office is close to this location and I go about 3-4 times a month. I love sitting outside now that it's cooler  plus you can bring your dog! The Pork Wings, brewers board and hummus are all great starters. I've eaten almost everything on the menu   A few of my favs are the kale/pear salad w added blackened salmon, burgers, brisket and the salmon BLT. I usually get the sweet potato fries . Additionally, the chicken/waffles, short ribs are all very good!   The servers are all attentive and Very helpful and there was on time our order was messed up but they fixed it immediately the manager apologized, removes it from the bill. Great service   I don't drink but if you do..several of my friends and people I've been there with absolutely love their beer etc selections.   I've heard the other locations are just as good! Go check it out you will have a solid experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is always amazing! My favorite burger is the AZ! Love the green dip sauce on it!!! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good place,  burgers and pretzel bread are really good.  Service was fast and everything cooked to order."}
{"text":"Beer, real good. Burgers, awesome. Fries, yum. Service, decent although a bit slow. Overall, I like this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Price is right, food is proper. Drink selection is spot on and service has a cavalier attitude typical of this type of establishment -- in a good way!   Highly recommend, can't wait till they actually start distilling."}
{"text":"I love this place! Friendly atmosphere and dog friendly. I tried their Brisket Mac & Cheese. It was delicious and very rich. I also took a couple of bites of their ham and cheese sandwich which was also very filling and oozing with cheese. The waitress was lovely and checked in with us many times to make sure everything was good. I wish I could remember her name. A great experience! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've gone in a few times recently and ended up having the same bartender. He actually remembered me after the second time and my drink, I was rather impressed. I wanted to try something new so Dane helped give some suggestions and it was really good. I ordered the tacos, they were really delicious. Danes customer service was outstanding as I watched him interact with the other customers, smiling, joking around and such. You are lucky to have someone like that since it seems rare these days in the food industry. Thank you for a great experience and I plan on being back and checking out some of the other locations."}
{"text":"So I came back to O.S.H.O for brunch, and had an excellent experience. The food was delicious, and the monster mimosa +food (for $10 I might add) made it even better! Our services was also great...will definitely come back.  I also think it was great that the management contacted me after my previous poor experience. It show great customer service!"}
{"text":"The Good *Large beer selection *Very dog friendly *Great waiting staff *Nice Patio  The Bad *The food is so-so  The Bottom Line O.H.S.O. is good spot to bring your dog and enjoy a beer or two.  Review I've been to O.H.S.O. a couple of times over the last few months. On each occasion I've brought my girlfriends dog Moose. On every visit the hostess and waiting staff have been incredibly accommodating to Moose who can sometimes get uncomfortable in strange busy places. They offer free dog treats made from spent grains and a bowl of water. Each bench on their patio comes with a carabiner to allow you to tie your dogs leash. Their craft beer menu is extensive and includes some uncommon brews. The only drawback i've found to O.H.S.O. is the food. It's not bad, it's just very mediocre. Some improvements to the food would really make this place great."}
{"text":"I love their kale and pear salad! The shrimp goes perfectly with it and the added protein is a plus. Yumm. My favorite beer is the Mr. Pineapple. They have good deals on their pitchers of beer during happy hour. Good environment, menu, drinks, and fast service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the low key environment, the fans and misters on the patio, and the great beer menu. I ordered the perfectly cooked salmon burger and my boyfriend got the mac and cheese del mar, which was delish! The Papago orange blossom was just as smooth and creamy as always. The only down fall was the lack of attention with service and the fact that the menu wasn't the same as the location in Phoenix (no cherizo flatbread here). I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's great beer here, atmosphere is good and food is just OK . Love the beer selection, and service is good as well."}
{"text":"We sat out back on the patio- perfect Bloody Mary, great food and friendly, prompt service. Only a couple of TV's though, so not an ideal place to watch sports."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go to this location every Saturday. A laid back atmosphere and always good music is perfect for our Saturday morning. Mimosas and breakfast are always worth the money if not more. Our servers are always accommodating and a pleasure to talk with. No Saturday morning is complete without O.H.S.O!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Something this Scottsdale area definitely needed for those of us who work in the area. It's a nice get away from the work day.  Food is just fantastic! The burger + cheese is definitely worth trying even if it sounds simple. Fries were outstanding too. No complaints."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch on a weekday.  We both ordered the highly recommended OHSO Bloody Mary.  The homemade beef jerky was too tough and dry for my liking, but the drink was otherwise okay.  I ordered the Pilgrim Sandwich and my husband had the Steak & Fries and  had it smothered w/cheese sauce.  The food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Terrific service and a nice place to grab a drink. I do like the veggie burger, done right. Dog friendly and will serve food late. Kudos."}
{"text":"My delicious tasting pineapple beer was unfortunately warm    I was excited to try the special Sunday beer brunch for $10. It comes with a dish of your choice with a mimosa or a beer. I chose the pineapple beer and my husband chose the peach. It is hot here in AZ so I was expecting our beers to be ice cold but they weren't....how disappointing.   My dish was the carnitas bowl. It comes with eggs, potatoes and salsa. When my dish came out the eggs were scrambled and stiff. As I looked around the entire restaurant everyone seemed to have scrambled eggs with their brunch entree. They must only serve powdered scrambled eggs.   Warm beer and powdered eggs? They need a bar rescue."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Always a distinguished array of draught beers, healthy and light food options as well as some greasy hungover eats. I've visited both locations and they are dog-friendly which is definitely boast-worthy. The bar is big and accommodating and the service is fast! The only undoing preventing my 5-star determination is the limited menu after 10pm."}
{"text":"Hot outside so I sat at a 2-top by the window in the bar.   Ordered a margarita which is not listed on the menu. The server said there was only one size and no flavor selection. Only choice was salt or no salt. I was surprised to see when it came that it was in an 8 oz \"old fashioned\" glass and that was full of ice. Not much room for the to-kill-ya. The drink was really tasty though so I actually ordered a second. After that, since I had no idea what I was paying per drink (turns out to be $7ea), I switched to a soft drink. Would have ordered a beer but I am considered a craft beer lightweight. I just don't like bitter beer so I stick to the commercial beers you can see through and they don't serve those here.  For food I ordered the Sunday \"Backyard BBQ\" Combo. It is an all-you-can-eat plate containing BBQ brisket, chicken, ribs, potato salad, coleslaw and cornbread for $15. IT ALL TASTED AWESOME!! I was full after one plate but ordered seconds of brisket and cornbread.  Wish I had repeated the potato salad and coleslaw which were among the best I have ever eaten.   In Scottsdale for a week and staying in a condo with kitchen and fridge but no food. I ordered some to-go to eat later. I took with me the Cobb Salad and the Pilgrim sandwich. I am sure they will be as delicious as the BBQ.  Since the food and drink tasted so great I would have rated this establishment 5 stars if it weren't so hard to get my server to come around for refills, more napkins, replacement utensil, etc.  I will probably eat here again before I fly home. Wish we had an O.H.S.O. there only with larger drink glasses 8-)"}
{"text":"Good service, patio is fine if you are into sitting in front of loud traffic (but dog friendly, which is a plus), and the food is good. Nothing earth shattering here, but it was good to find a place that felt \"local\" during my AZ trip (SO MANY chains). They distill their own vodka, and it was damn good."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale is lucky to have Tim the guy who recommended the carnitas bowl and OHSO"}
{"text":"Went here for $10 beer brunch.  It was magnificent.  The beer was excellent, I had the house white ale with orange.  My husband had the biscuits and gravy with the IPA--it was all he could do to not order another round just because he liked the gravy so much.  Highly recommend the bunch."}
{"text":"OMG. O.H.S.O. is such a N.O.N.O. I have been to the location on Hayden about 3 times trying my best to give them another try. Epic fail. Lousy service, including 10-minute wait for drink order, while sitting at the bar; wrong returned drink order because the skinny brunette who took our order was more into chatting with her friends sitting next to us; and cold food. Go to the Tatum and Shea location, IF you are going to patronize this eatery."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best FEMALE bartenders I have had in years ... a very special thank you to Courtney for such awesomeness ... thank you so much for the fantastic recommended gluten free menu ... me and Michi will be regulars ... WE value nice ladies specially the \"blondturage\"  Humbly HairDocTK"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, good food, better drinks..  With that being said, the absolute worst service I have ever received. I gave this restaurant three attempts to correct their poor service and lack of attention. For the three times I have been there, typically 20-25 min to get my first drink, have to keep my mouth wet by sucking on the ice cubes because I can't get another drink.   Most likely won't go back, too bad."}
{"text":"My experience was bad, could be an anomaly but won't waste my time n $$ going there again! Four peaks is faaaar better and next door. Ambience overkill, mediocre service and the ahi-calamari appetizer for $15 was one of the most disgusting tastes I have experienced. Sorry for the ahi n calamari that gave their lives to this sub standard dish . The waiter got us ketchup after 20min of asking, when all the fries were eaten! Expensive and small portions. Looks like people pay for those bicycles hanging all over the place. Narai Thai which this location replaced was a far better joint! Oh yeah we need one more blando bland boring brewery in town, like we don't have 50 others within a few miles of each other. I don't have a problem with breweries or bland food really, I love beer and the food is really good in many. This experience was BAD."}
{"text":"Good selection of drinks, apps, and food. Outdoor seating was comfortable and there was plenty available and the music wasn't too loud. I had a virgin mojito martini (?) which was refreshing, a Shirley temple, and the grilled cheese. Overall a nice place to have HH and relax."}
{"text":"Comfortable yet trendy. Just right for the unwind times. \"What's a guy gotta do to get a Tee Shirt around here?\"  I wear a medium in case you want to buy me one.  Birth month is coming soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I would come back here again. I went on a Thursday evening and it was pretty busy but not too crowded.  Pros: Pretzels & Cheese and White Sangria, absolutely delish!  Cons: The grilled cheese sandwich wasn't that great, it does contain prosciutto but it turned out to be more of a prosciutto sandwich with cheese. I dipped it in ketchup and it was okay.  The service was good. Our server was quick, not overly personable but he was clearly very busy and he got the job done with no mistakes."}
{"text":"We really like coming here for appetizers. The food is ok but the pretzel board is delicious. Not sure why they can't serve cold beer glasses. The cooler has been down for months is the excuse they give. But when. It is over 100 a cold frosty glass is required."}
{"text":"I always really enjoy OHSO. They have a great atmosphere and a nice beer selection including tons of local beers as well as beers brewed in house. Their menu is great too and has some nice choices. The food is close to perfect with usually just a minor flaw or two which is why they get 4/5 stars. Example, last time our burger buns were quite undercooked and almost doughy but everything else was amazing. We will keep coming back and keep enjoying ourselves. Great pet friendly patios too!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner. We both had the Brisket sandwich and upgraded our fries to sweet potato fries. The sandwich was huge with fried onion shreds. Very nice. Service was great. Katie kept our water glasses filled and kept checking on us. Great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good burgers and nice beer selection.  Also love the free dog treats they give out made from leftover brewing mash.  Very cool patio too."}
{"text":"Not as large as their Acadia location, but nice, clean and same extensive beer selection. Seems like the menu is a bit different, but had good sandwiches. I'm excited to try the Beer Brunch."}
{"text":"Perfect if you are in your early 20's for brunch.  The food was just ok nothing great.  I had the breakfast bowl with steak it was good but nothing different from what I could get at home. The salsa lacked flavor, and heat.  We tried the donutholes which were tasty. Brunch comes with a mimosa for a penny which is cool if you want to get blasted.  Dogs are all over which is ok."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go-to and favorite place because it's dog-friendly. We bring our 4 year old vizsla here at least three times a month. The food is great but the setup is really why we come here. Can't beat it if you want to dine with your pooch."}
{"text":"We had a nice brunch here on a sunday morning. The biscuits and gravy are the best I've had since my time in Atlanta. Really delicious. And can I tell you... that mimosa is awesome! For $10, it just can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Best place to drink beer and watch sports in town. Good food. Very family friendly.  Great patio. Just an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Eli, I'm an English Cream Golden Retriever, and yes I've hacked my dads account. This place is the top barks!   My dad loves to have his happy hours here or honestly any excuse I think.. I really like it because, well for pets sake, let's be honest... I'm quite the handsome hound and the crowd here I feel appreciates me for who I am and not just for my good looks.. I'm pawsitive you'll feel that way too.. Also There are a lot of beautiful babes of all types, short hair, long hair,  fuzzy hair, long tails, no tails, pig tails....  I'm panting just writing this...   I've never been as interested in the sour beers my dad always howls highly about, but that Brisket Mac, he's in love with that stuff. I try every time to get a sample, but to no avail, it's quite ruff... Luckily the waiter/tress always give me some special snack, don't worry I'm still not giving up on trying that brisk-Mac..   This place is no furry-tail, well kinda, but in a good way. Stop by, give me a paw-five and I'll show you where the water bowls are..."}
{"text":"We enjoy the atmosphere and the happy hour, but this place is very pricey for the food options. While a lot of the burgers and sandwiches are pretty good, it isn't quite worth the price they are asking. However the beer menu and in house liquor they produce is awesome! You should really hold out for the happy hour if you want to try this place out, because some of their cocktails are available during that time and are really delicious! They also have a breakfast brunch deal where you get a mimosa or beer with your food, which really makes the price more worth it. Plus the mimosa is great. Overall I just wish th food menu either gave you more food for the price or was cheaper."}
{"text":"OHSO is so-so. Wanted to try this location after being somewhat disenchanted by another location in Phoenix. It was nice to see a full outdoor patio with some doggies enjoying the patio too. Our server was a very kind guy that wanted to ensure our meal was satisfactory. Overall, the food was good; ordered a salmon burger with bacon and a BBQ pulled beef sandwich with fried onions along with sides of salad and sweet potato fries. My issues were that the salmon was undercooked, the side salad was minuscule (not at all worth an extra dollar), and just out of concern, the patio seems precariously close to cars driving by."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch around 11:15. Not very busy. The place is pretty large with a full area to the back. The menu is mostly hamburgers but there are some salads and Mac anc cheese meals. I had the pork Mac and cheese and it was extremely good. I recommend it. Large servings as I couldn't eat it all.  Ice tea is good. Flavored, but not sugary.   I would go back."}
{"text":"Shared a few appetizers with friends and those were wonderful! Would definitely recommend getting the steak frites.  Got the pilgrim sandwich. It was an alright sandwich. Kind of dry, but did like the overall mix of flavors in the sandwich.  I also tried some of my friend's beer. Wonderfully light and not bad! I'm also not really someone who drinks alcohol so that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Four of us went in. It has been quite a while since I had been.  Wow they have changed. The food seemed to cost more and the menu was not as tasty. We had two orders of the carne asada tacos. The meat was way over cooked. The guacamole was tasteless. One blackened salmon. The salmon was full of flavor, it was a bit sweet tasting.  On the training wheels menu we had a cheeseburger, no cheese. The meat was dry however some ketchup helped with that.  The fries were the best part, tasty and done well.  No beverages other than water. $61 pre tip.  Sorry OHSO, you were better when you first opened."}
{"text":"Very good experience at OHSO. Beers were very nice (I enjoyed an 89 Ale and a \"guest\" amber), and bartender was very helpful in selecting appetizers ($3 for happy hour!) and food. Our favorite items were the crab cheese (better and with more filling than most Chinese restaurants) and the brisket mac (big helping - we shared). The mac was not overly cheesy, but the combination of meat, pasta, bbq sauce, spice (it has a little heat, not a lot), and nice, stringy cheese was a winner. We'd surely order it again. Only item we would skip next time was the deviled egg dip...pretty bland. Nice, casual atmosphere and lots of smiling happy people. Great time!"}
{"text":"We went to watch game 7 of the Yankees playing the Dodgers the other night. The waitstaff was wonderful: Ryan welcomed us and got us started, Chelsea and Meredith helped us get the tv stations on and the sound we wanted. All three took excellent care of us even though we had entered a section slightly before they were ready to start serving. Soon Jesse came on and he was a gem as well. We would return to that location and that section just to be served by those four wonderful servers. A bonus! We were able to chat for awhile with the Executive Chef Bret Sanchez. Since my SO is a chef, they got onto shop talk and it was just fun to have the opportunity to chat with him.  We are both so impressed with this location. The food was excellent (I had the Pastrami Sandwich and my SO had the ribs and garlic mashed potatoes.) There was a birthday party on the patio and they were having the time of their lives. They even shared some of the brownie with strawberries they had for dessert.   This is a very clean location. Food is excellent. Servers and kitchen staff are on their game. The food is fresh, the beer is fresh. It was fabulous. I bring all this up because I did a negative review awhile back at the Paradise Valley location. We have decided we will revisit that to see if it's time to change my rating of that one based upon our excellent experience here.   One thing that stood out at this Hayden location: the staff love their jobs. The management must take great care of them and it translates to the level of service and care we received. I don't say this lightly. By profession I do a lot of customer service and management training in the Hospitality industry. So I pay closer attention to these things than many people might. We will definitely return.  One more thing - this is a huge place. If you are a meeting planner looking for a location to bring your convention or conference group, check out this location. Lots of room, lots of opportunities to block off sections just for smaller groups. The banquet food menu looks really good."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, great late night spot. Wonderful, friendly service, I saw someone was not happy that there were no high chairs on the patio. It is a brewery! I would hope not and I wouldn't want to listen to screaming children while enjoying my adult beverage at a bar. So kudos to ohso."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan.  We had a work party in the back bar last week.  The service was quick and attentive...even though they were pretty busy.  The staff is helpful and kept the beers flowing.  Good selection of beers too... the OHSO beers are stellar."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not sure how there are already comments on the quality of their distilled liqueur as it's not available here yet.  We came here on their second night open. It was a Saturday. The place was crowded and loud on the inside. They were out of one of the beers we tried to order. Overall, the food was just as good as the other location's and the service only seemed to be marginally better, which isn't saying much.  The food and drink selection is eclectic,  Pico de gallo on the pesto hummus, yucca chips, and basil in half of the signature drinks.  Despite the eclectic nature of the menu, nothing really jumped out at me.  I wish the snacky items were available outside of happy hour. Everything I tried was alright, and I'll probably come back once in a while after the opening hype has died down and the distillery is actually up and running."}
{"text":"Ok.  What's NOT to love about OHSO?  They have a great ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food, oh and the best part?  They're dog friendly!   Having moved to Scottsdale a couple months ago, I had no idea where i could take my doberman Zeik to hang out.  I found OHSO through bringfido.com I believe and decided to try it out.  This location is conveniently about 5 minutes away from our Dog Park so we now make it part of our routine to come here after our playdates at the park.    It only took us about 2 visits for the staff to know us and our dogs.  Theres usually a little bit of a wait on Friday nights but they were incredibly welcoming with giving our dogs water and taking drink orders for us while we waited.    On the patio tables there are leash hooks that you can hook your dog onto while you eat.  They also have cookies for the pups too, made of spent  hops and I believe they are organic.  Our pooches love them.    But lets talk about the food!  I am always torn between the BBQ burger and the Arizona  burger when I come here.  The Arizona burger is their top seller and it literally melts in your mouth upon your first bite.  The cheesy gooeyness of the zesty cream cheese along with the kick of jalapeno is complemented perfectly with the sweetness of the soft bun and crisp onion strings.  For $12, this is the BEST burger and fries that you can get in Scottsdale.   I've been meaning to write a review on OHSO for a while now, but I can hands down say this  place has won  us over and is  our favorite restaurants.   My only regret this morning is that I didn't have any leftovers!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch about a week or so ago... I've been here a few times. Great place for some drinks and very nice set up outside. The food is mediocre. My friends salad was delicious I do have to say. But my burger was not anything special. I would of rather had a burger from In n Out only because mine was barely warm and the sweet potato fries were dry and cold. The waitress is nice. I usually never order food here, just appetizers and I think that is what people should stick too as well."}
{"text":"Love love love the ambience in this brewery however our waitress and food were not that great.  The beer selection was wonderful and our food came out quick but the burger dad may not great.  It came with a jalapeno cream cheese spread and aoili on top of that.  Overall it was just too much.  The guacamole and wings were delicious though. Our waitress was not very friendly and was almost insulted when we asked for recommendations."}
{"text":"Hats off to the general manager who immediately responded to a food quality issue we experience.  He took positive action to make things 100% better and we hope to go back to the Hayden Road location for a meal many more times in the future. Good job of taking care of the customer!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. I wish they had a bigger alcohol selection but still a great place to eat with family or friends!"}
{"text":"So let me begin, I hate giving this review, as I have been a loyal fan & customer of OHSO.  Now, I'm not sure....This is a pet friendly place, so I decided to host a puppy shower (we recently lost one of our dogs, so we thought this would be a great place to celebrate a new puppy which we brought into our family), so about a week ago, on a normal dinner visit, I had asked to rsvp for a table of 12, and yes, they could accommodate,  nothing further stated.  Yesterday they called me to check on the reservation, and ask me to confirm, which I did, and stated that it looked like the rsvp could go to 14, great nothing else stated.   So today, I arrive with a few of the guest, and I'm told that we had to wait until all 12 were present, and that if they didn't show up within 15 minutes our table would be given away???? So after confronting the manager, stating that this was never stated upon making the rsvp, and stated that I had been a loyal customer(which she stated she recognized) would not budge on her statement until pressured a bit from other friends.) I even stated, that we probably wouldn't be back, she could careless..finally she lowered the number to 6.  Well needless to say the entire party showed up.  BUT I will say this,  I'm not sure I'm going back, breaks my heart as we have loved it here, but to make us wait on a hot day, until all 12, with two dogs literally in my hands, and the lack of caring that we have been loyal customers, I'm not sure. AND my guest with me, will probably not be back either, matter of fact one stated, one more reason to why I HATE it here...?? Up until this point, nothing but great college kids working here, but it really didn't make the beginning of the party fun.  IF I had known this info, I would have placed it on the invites...BE ON TIME TO ALL 12 INVITES...to her rule, well if 10 shows, not 12 we release the table...crazy.  Not appreciative of the lack of appreciation of a TRULY loyal customer, and when I say loyal a few years, and at least once or perhaps twice a week."}
{"text":"Not bad. I like the brunch here and friendly staff. This one is much smaller and less fun than the other location on Tatum. Usually pretty packed on the weekends so plan for that."}
{"text":"Good beer (had the handlebar) and surprisingly great food. A great find while driving around the area."}
{"text":"From out of town and was brought here for lunch. The food was really good and the service was as well. Had the Blackened Salmon and it was really tasty - cleaned the plate! I would go back again!"}
{"text":"First time with a big group, and although they don't take reservations, we got in right away! Derek was our server and he did a great job getting through all of our food and drink orders. We are quite the group to try to get through, so he did a great job. Would recommend anyone to this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm already planning a date with my dog to come back. This place has a dog friendly patio! I came here tonight for dinner and drinks and was pleasantly surprised by the relaxed feel and friendly staff. They have a wonderful selection of beer and cocktails, and the food is off-the-hook. We had the Az burger (amazing) and the Diablo burger (equally amazing), along with the spinach and artichoke dip (to die for). As if yummy drinks and delicious dinner wasn't enough, we went in for the Carmel apple pie, and all I have to say is, I have absolutely no regrets! This is a must try! Make sure you check out the distillery in the back, it's super cool!"}
{"text":"Fun place with very friendly staff.  Nice front patio with umbrella table covering.  Has a bit of a cyclist vibe.  Good selection of local brews.  Limited parking in front but plenty in the shopping area behind the buildings."}
{"text":"I'm definitely partial to the Arcadia location due to their awesome patio area, but this O.H.S.O. is a welcome addition to Scottsdale.  Brunch, as always, is great.  $10 for food and a beer or mimosa is an amazing deal.  It's dog-friendly, plus they have water bowls and treats for your pups!  Their patio also has great ambiance with orange umbrellas, cool lights and fun music as well.    Service is particularly fast at this location, likely because it's not quite as busy as the Arcadia spot, but I'm sure it will only get more and more popular.  The staff is very friendly as well.    Enjoy ... and if you have a dog, bring them!  They'll enjoy it, too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this afternoon and was immediately greeted by the hostess. When I sat down, I was immediately greeted by a server with water and a warm welcome. We ordered a couple of their house craft beers, which were great. We ate a bacon burger and the skirt steak, both were fantastic. We also had a bottle of Wavertree Pinot Noir and it was EXCELLENT and paired with the food perfectly. I would suggest OHSO to anyone! They have a dog friendly patio that I am looking to take my dog to this weekend!  Go visit OHSO soon, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Solid beer selection. Good atmosphere. Biscuits and Gravy is really good. Brunch they give you a beer or mimosa. Nice play to have a pint and relax."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of brews, many local.  Truly outstanding staff who really seem to love working there.  Why not, they get to sample the wares."}
{"text":"From solely the drinking experience, O.H.S.O offers a great time with a good selection of brews and whiskeys.  My bros and I had our fill of Four Peaks and wanted to find the next location. Luckily our next stop was practically next door. On a late Saturday night O.H.S.O was relatively empty compared to Four Peaks, but I don't think that's indicative of the quality at all.  In terms of the beers, there's a good variety from in house brews, local AZ, and across the country. The Orange Blossom pint was really nice, and my friends and I can vouch for their Hef and the Blackberry Sour from out of state.  Whether it's the brews or the hard stuff, what I really appreciated was how real the guys behind the bar were. They weren't afraid to tell you if something was absolutely awful - we mutually agreed to rename one of the whiskeys \"Gasoline\" for good reason.  This place has a good vibe. From what I saw from the other customers the food looked bomb as well. For somewhere that started as my number 2 stop it definitely became my number 1 for the night. Looking forward to coming again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat and have a beer in North Scottsdale.  The interior is the coolest hippest ever.  The food is gourmet pub fare and absolutely delicious.   The staff is absolutely friendly and best service..  YOU have to try the new OHSO!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing especially the creamy polenta.  I've been to many breweries and the house selection is the best I've seen.  Happy hour prices are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Quality food and good service should be a given in No Scottsdale...but precious few in this segment get it right.  Clearly someone at O.H.S.O is working hard and putting it all together with a nice selection of tasty locally crafted  beer.   Get in there and try the seasonal So Fresh So Green wet hopped IPA....Fresh citrus without the IPA bite...fantastic.  Salmon BLT paired with side of jalapeño polenta was also very good.  Service was friendly, efficient and well organized (thanks L.R.)  Would have easily been 5 stars if they served filtered water instead of putrescent city tap water. I'll bet the water in the beer is filtered.  If you don't use it in the beer, shouldn't put it on the table."}
{"text":"Went last night for a late dinner after a rough day at work. Sat out on the patio and I was happy to see that next time we go we can bring our dogs!! Everyone was very attentive, service was all quick...drinks apps and meals came out in perfect timing. I had the hummus which was delicious and the salmon entree which was heavenly. Cooked to perfection. A little crispy outside and perfect on the inside it flaked apart exactly how salmon should and was over perfectly tender asparagus and the cous cous quinoa was quite good too. Portions were just right I felt satisfied but not disgustingly full which I usually hate the feeling after eating at a restaurant even if I don't eat a ton, the food is usually heavy and full of bad stuff. This was like a meal I'd cook myself. Cocktails and beers were just great too. Not one thing was bad or went wrong which is a rare occurrence when I go out to eat. Having been in the service industry for many years in the past as well as my husband, we tend to be a little picky (being from NJ/NYC has also made us a little uptight and picky as well!) So if we loved this then it MUST be good!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"1st time at OHSO on Friday. Sat inside hoping it was cooler but it was about 80 in the bar booth area. $6 small pitcher of AZ craft beer was a great deal but not very cold. Food was ok, burger was nothing special and mexican style salad was pretty good. Doubt I'll go back when 4 Peaks is so close. Even Skeptical is better all around."}
{"text":"I love the environment of this establishment. It is fun, friendly and makes you feel familiar. I love their love and treatment of dogs as well. And the beer selection is awesome! These reasons are what keeps me coming back! I just wish the food was better. It falls a little short. Its kind of like who ever created the recipes really didn't know what they were doing. For example the hummus is so spicy you can barely eat it and I'm very tolerant of spice. The ceviche is flavorless. (I love ceviche, so this makes me sad). The burger is marginal. The only thing I really liked in my multiple times there is the beat salad.   I would highly recommend this place for happy hour, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Well, I was told that the establishment was an upscale popular spot that was highly recommended. For the Scottsdale area, I did have expectations of something other than what we received.  We had a reservation for 12. We were late but frankly it wasn't a problem as the restaurant had maybe 20% of the chairs filled.  We sat down at a long bench style booth and despite the lack of people in the establishment, the noise due to the music was overbearing. It was hard to hear anything.  Our waiter was indifferent and when asked about menu items his suggestions were flaccid. He recommended everything and when pressed if he had tried some of them, he admitted no but customers had. Besides his disinterest, he did get some of the order incorrect.   My meal was a burger. How can a restaurant screw up a burger? Well the bun is critical. In this case, while the beef and toppings were wonderful, the bun was flimsy and soaked in the juice from the meat along with mayo. It fell apart immediately and I had to eat it deconstructed with a fork.  The drinks were watered down- I ordered a double vodka cran in a tall glass and it honestly tasted like cranberry.  We spent over $500 for my group and it was not worth the cost. The joint doesn't have a lot of personality and coupled with a negative customer experience element it was a bit disconcerting."}
{"text":"Yeah I could start this out with a giant review telling you how great this place is but I rather have you go there and check it out yourself. The management has been trained how to handle situations properly. Bonus that we have great fast service and delicious food here every time. A person in our party had a problem with their food and they handled it awesome. Made the customer feel welcome and not ostracized for having a small problem with a mis handled order. We were all impressed. Manger and staff have great energy and positive vibes. Thanks guys! We had a big party of 16 and they accommodated us awesome! Gave us 3 wait staff and manager treated us great. Close proximity to our PT facility and ample parking. Thanks for taking pride in your food and your great service! Big Dave and staff love you guys..."}
{"text":"Terrible service and even worse food. I can't understand why people like to come here. Beer is expensive. Save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"Ours salads were really great, the chicken was grilled, and hot; and the veggies, dressing, and cheese was cold and crisp. Service was really slow for only having 3-4 tables being occupied, but cool atmosphere. Love the dog friendly, covered patio."}
{"text":"Tried some more food with pretty good results. One person had the short rib macaroni and cheese. It contained a decent flavored barbeque sauce, but that sauce on top of the creamy pasta did not go totally together. The onion strings though added a good crunch. My dish was the chicken and waffles with the chicken being better than the waffles. It was two off the bone plain breaded chicken breasts that got better once you dipped them into the \"spicy\" syrup which wasn't too spicy luckily. The waffles left a bit to be desired and I don't think they were freshly prepared. The dish also had alot of very crisp bacon. Misters outside were not working, so eat your summer dinner inside people."}
{"text":"I have been to OHSO many times and usually have a great experience. However, Friday night on May 22 was not the case. My friends and I were out celebrating my 30th birthday, a big deal! As soon as we entered the bar shortly after midnight, the bartender, a younger blonde girl with hipster glasses, began to rudely tell us that she hoped we didn't drive there, we could all get DUIs, etc. We explained to her that we had walked, as my friends lived right up the street. \"You can still get DUIs for walking\", she told us in a condescending and argumentative tone. As my friends explained that we were simply celebrating a birthday and just having fun, she chimed in that there was also nothing special she could do for my birthday, \"The kitchen's already closed.\" Oooookay, I would've thought some kind of exception might be made but I was very wrong. So we ordered some drinks and she served us all, some of us more than one drink. For a bartender that was just spouting about DUIs, she did not seem very concerned about serving us anyway and collecting her tips. After collectively killing the mood for all of us, we could not wait to finish our drinks and leave. As I said, I normally enjoy OHSO but based on my experience I will think twice about going to this location again."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat and drink!   Enjoyed lunch/brunch here and the Morning Brew is outstanding!   Great burgers, breakfast bowl was good and the beer is excellent!   Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great hot pastrami sandwich. Love my Popsicle Blonde beer. And great tunes!!  Love the atmosphere for a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Bring your dog, ride your bike, eat great food and drink excellent craft beer.   Weekends are great for brunch which comes with a beer or a giant mimosa.   Awesome patio at both locations!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks. Had the best whiskey ever and it's from Japan! Had the pretzel board, perfect! I'm so happy to relocate to Arizona because of places like this. They also have a dog friendly patio. Walk on down for happy hour or reverse happy hour. You won't be disappointed!  I've been to ohso in Scottsdale about four times. I moved to Arizona only two weeks ago. I was fortunate enough to meet the man Greg. He came by and educated me about how he makes the liquor and his future plans. I really like the vodka. It makes a really smooth vodka tonic. It's hard to find a liquor that can stand on its own so well. I'm excited to hear about the jalapeño liquor that will be coming soon.  -Jayna"}
{"text":"I met a friend here after work yesterday, and I was so thrilled that she recommended it.  It was right up my alley!  A big bike hanging inside, and a dog and bike friendly patio!!  Loved the vibe here - the final four basketball was playing.  I had an orange blossom beer - quite yummy - it was the perfect spring beer, and from a brewery in Scottsdale, and the chicken mac, which I had no problem eating every bit of , even though it was huge!  Perfect creamy texture, and taste with just the right amount of chicken chunks. I also tried the salted caramel cake which a tiny bit dry, but good!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers to choose from. Had the brisket sandwich and it was surprisingly good. Check them out if you like  craft beers and a pretty good brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"There aren't many restaurant bar chains that make you feel like home the minute you walk in the door. OSHO distillery has a creative menu with quality ingredients, a friendly staff that becomes your new best friends, and an environment ready for whatever happens next.   Beyond the menu the distillery offers their own liquors and beers with quality mixology within a shout.  The food is creative, especially considering a brunch of fruity pebbles waffles or biscuits and gravy, and bbq on Sunday's with tacos every day.   If you're looking for a place like home to grab a drink and a bite, osho delivers beer food and friends with clever delight."}
{"text":"For those who have read my reviews, several know I gave a glowing review of Ohso in Arcadia.  I will not give this location a bad review, but will say it is ho-hum compared to the original location.  The staff is excellent, and several elements parallel the Arcadia location.  But the biggest detriment to the North Scottsdale location is the actual location, inside the generic shopping complex at Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright.  How can one feel the same magic of the Arcadia location in a location which features an oh-so entrancing view of the...  parking lot.  And Hayden Road.  From my own perspective, it appears this location was picked just to have a location in North Scottsdale vs. a place creating a landmark in a local community.   Hopefully, this location can perfect a craft indigenous to this location, because the natural setting is working against this establishment.  This will have to be a task for the staff to create their own magic.  One recommendation I have is to improve the lighting and lower the music.  Otherwise, they are friendly, energetic and seem to want to make this establishment a success.  Compare to the original location.  The Arcadia restaurant features a majestic view of the canal, bike path and Camelback Mountain.  They even screened a hideous view of a utility area with industrial artwork and fencing.  This location also is known for its dog-friendly environment, creating an excellent subculture in the Arcadia neighborhood.  North Scottsdale does have better parking than the Arcadia locale, but that is about where the accolades stop with my experience.  The staff is excellent, but they have their work cut out for them.  This place may be a success as people living in the local community may enjoy Ohso close by, but I cannot feel the same magic overlooking a parking lot.  But this is merely my opinion.  Experience it yourself and see if you may enjoy what this new location has to offer."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and sweet potato fries.  The hamburgers also are on home cooked buns.  Beer selection is out of the world!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger, as good as Hop Doddy. Tried a couple different local beers, not bad, but  not excellent will try another brew choice next time."}
{"text":"enjoy the food and beer... always good! but the music sucks!!  loud and terrible.  I wonder if the music is for the guests or the wait staff. turn it down or change the station!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch and I'm giving it 3 stars because the burger was decent and they had some good staff members. Our server Jann did not smile once or even introduce herself. I only know her name because it was on the tab... When she said thank you for coming in, she didn't even look at us. She didn't seem busy, just tired or something. Not once did she check on our food after we got it and we had to ask a busboy for our check. We also got the biscuits and gravy brunch deal that came with a mimosa. The gravy was barely warm and I wouldn't get it again. I could be because we came in around 1:30pm but I'm paying the same price as the customers coming in at 11am... It would make sense to provide the same quality unless that was just it. Maybe our server was hungover. I saw her take care of her other tables and still, not a smile. We'll come back, but we're not getting brunch or sitting in Jann's section. Should've sat at the bar. The bartender greeted us - not the hostess and he seemed nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Most dog friendly place in town! Great food, drinks, and service too! My little dog and I love OHSO, and we hope they will open a Central Phoenix location soon!"}
{"text":"Great patio, okay food and service. I ordered a beer and it came out later than the rest of the table (with no apology or explanation) and it was served warm which was disappointing. Our waitress was not friendly and made a huge deal when we asked that our checks be split up. I had a salad with chicken. The chicken was over cooked. The apps were fine, but they brought them out with our food which was frustrating.  Overall I like the patio and beer, but I can't say I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"New location but I had not been to the original spot, so this review is from a new customer to OHSO. I was driving past to Four Peaks (same strip mall area just around the corner from each other) and stopped here instead to check it out for a late night drink and some small bites. It just looked fun and inviting from the parking lot. I had also never been to a distillery in Phoenix before.  The atmosphere is great. Modern, urban, welcoming, and warm with a great patio area. Music was lively and we were joking with the waiter that we were in Club OHSO.   The menu was very short, I would have liked a few more options, but I didnt take any points off for that. I did take a star off because  the storefront says OHSO Eatery + Distillery - the distillery isn't open (and wont be for at least a few more weeks) which was disappointing as that was the primary reason for the last minute change of plans of OHSO over Four Peaks."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. Dog friendly with patio and free doggie treats. Bummer thru only serve breakfast on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and allows pets! Dogs can sit on benches and the servers bring water and treats for your furry friends not to mention every staff member coming over to give your dog some friend pets!"}
{"text":"Came here with an old friend for dinner tonight who lives in the area! I love checking out new places while traveling and this did not disappoint.  I loved the outdoor patio and seeing dogs everywhere!! If I lived in Scottsdale I feel I would totally be a regular here with my dogs!   Anyways, the menu seems to be sort of upscale pub fare. We ordered the pastrami sandwich, crispy pork belly, and the BBQ burger with turkey instead of beef, no cheese and no bun.  Food was delivered rather quickly and was really fresh.  Service and experience were great. I wish my fiancé was with me to sample the brews! Next time I'm in Scottsdale this will be on my list!"}
{"text":"Opening night...crazy busy! Our server didnt miss a beat though. The decor is hip and fun just like the crowd. Lots of patio diners brought their pooches. OHSO really caters to the 4 legged darlings with water bowls and fresh baked doggie biscuits.   I thought the menu, and especially the appetizers, were over priced but oh well!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the cool vibe and the ambiance of this place. The outdoor seating is very comfortable. They have a variety of drinks and good beers to chose from. I would highly recommend the BBQ burger. The calamari appetizer was good (all 5 small pieces of the $15)- I would not recommend the calamari, as it was not enough for what was paid for. Overall, they have delicious food and good drinks, it was a fun experience, and I would definitely recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best beers and burgers. My husband and I have been trying all of the new breweries, but OHSO remains my favorite!"}
{"text":"Love the patio here! Food is pretty good and their drinks are great! I always order the shhhh! It's also dog friendly so it's always fun to see the different pups people bring with them . It can get busy so if you're in a rush don't come here during their busy hours."}
{"text":"O.H.S.O was actually pretty good!  I was meeting up with some friends, after a long day driving through Tonto National Forest, and was looking for a late night dinner place in Scottsdale, which isn't easy. We were having trouble finding a place, when I stumbled upon O.H.S.O. Distillery online, probably with some help from yelp! :)  The food was very good! I had the BBQ burger. My pet peeve, if you've read my other reviews, is asking for my burgers to be very 'well-done,' but having them brought to the table pink and bloody inside. I often have to send them back (sometimes multiple times) to get it cooked properly. I can't help it- I like what I like and I can't eat drippy, pink burgers. Bleck! :(  Well, O.H.S.O. did not disappoint. I did not have to return my burger. It was cooked properly, to my preferences, which I greatly appreciated. It was a pretty large burger too...piled high with onion strings and bacon. Definitely no skimping here!  My friends had already eaten dinner, so they opted for dessert. The caramel apple pie, and the flourless chocolate cake. The dessert portions were large and both seemed very happy with their choices!  They had a nicely lit outdoor seating area.The restaurant is definitely the type of place I could see people, including myself, kicking back with a few drinks and having a good time. It had a casual ambience, yet the customers seemed a bit trendy. It seemed to be popular with the 20's crowd...again probably b/c it's one of the few decent places in Scottsdale opened past 9pm, on a Sunday. :)  I would definitely go back and spend more time at O.H.S.O. the next time I'm in the Scottsdale area! Yay!"}
{"text":"This place was really cute. Polite and enthusiastic servers. It had a great atmosphere with plenty of umbrellas. We had Sunday brunch. The mimosas are mostly champagne, which was fine with me. I also had the monte Cristo with a side of eggs. The food was ok. The scrambled eggs were hard. Otherwise, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a group from husband's work. They reserved some tables on the side patio. When we first arrived, the hostess informed us it was their policy to not seat anyone until 12 guests in the party arrived. Kinda strange! The place was busy and I assume they don't want to waste large tables for small group in case people don't show up.  We had a drink at the bar while waiting for our group. It was quite loud. Yes, it's a bar, it's going to be loud... I get it. But even so, it was just a notch or two over acceptable level of loud lol Our group arrived so we moved to the \"quieter\" side patio, near the ping pong tables. Our server was good, attentive enough. He warned us when happy hour was ending. Brought chilled glasses for the beer.  We ordered a few of \"small bites\" before dinner. No false advertising there - definitely small enough for one. The pretzel and cheese was good, and so was the hummus.  I ordered the Green Chili pulled pork and swapped the bun for corn tortillas. When the dish arrived it was buried underneath a mound of rice. I ended scraping all of that rice on to the serving plate. There had to be at least a cup and half of rice- maybe more. The food was okay. Definitely disappointed in a $15 entree that was mostly rice! My husband had the blackened salmon, more rice on his plate as well. I had a bite of his salmon, and it was also underwhelming. The accompanying sauce tasted like warmed over, thinned out sweetened condensed milk.  Others in the group had the brisket Mac and cheese that looked good, shrimp tacos and a burger. I couldn't tell if there was a giant mound  of rice on that shrimp taco plate.  I should mention that their cocktails weren't bad. Hubby likes his Old Fashioned and I had a Cue the Lime.   If you come for drinks only it isn't bad. But don't waste your money on $15 plates of rice for dinner."}
{"text":"Always good beer.  I had the IPA of the month something called \"I'm on vacation\" which was a combined effort with Goldwater brewing.  It was great!  A nice hint of citrus and seemed like mango and not overpowering hops.  Also had the Diablo burger and fries, excellent bar food!  This is a keeper!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a much younger son of a friend. It is pretty good. The service was great: our waitress and other staff were as attentive as a customer can hope for. Beverages were refilled quickly. Advice was cheerfully given. Three out of our table of four ordered different kinds of burgers and all were very happy. This being a brunch, I ordered a bratwurst and scrambled egg entree. It tasted good but came lukewarm which became cold before I could eat much. I considered less stars but everything else was perfect. My advice would be that a group order the same type of food. Obviously my plate was finished and put aside while the burgers and fries were cooked. It then was located and served after the other plates had been delivered. C'est la vie. I expect to return."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch menu for just $10 which includes mimosa or beer. Fun outdoor patio with misters makes for comfortable seating. Our server \"Byrklei\" was both personable and helpful. Had the lox, bagel and cream cheese. Soo good."}
{"text":"Sat breakfast was just OK  very bland.  However,  we had great service and a lovely table outside in the sun surrounded by dogs awesome atmosphere experience."}
{"text":"Good food and a cool atmosphere! Pretzel board was delicious and the salmon tacos were amazing! Check this place out next time you are in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Beer selection was small but not bad. Food was good but forgettable. Staff was friendly when around, but didn't come check on us too often. Would be better if their happy hour wasn't strictly pitchers of beer, but still a good deal if you can narrow it down to just one"}
{"text":"Stopped here for our second visit on a Saturday afternoon.  Made sure to hit after brunch so we could enjoy the regular menu.  Not a fan of brunch, or brunch menus.  I can make eggs at home.  Sat at the bar, which is a must in the afternoons.  It's where you get the best feel of any place.  Really nice beer selections, both micro and macro.  My wife wanted to come back after our first visit so she could try the cubano sandwich, so I knew what we would be splitting.  I also ordered the pretzel plate.  The pretzels were good and the beer cheese dip was great.  The Cubano was fine, but the relish (in place of dill pickles, I guess) was spicy.  I prefer a little more traditional, but it was still good.  However, the fries are freakin' awesome!  I'm talking beef tallow good.  Atmosphere is great and it's a laid back place.  Great for day drinking.  Dogs are welcome and even get some homemade treats, which judging by the way our dog attacks these things (you can take a sample bag home), she would rate this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to go and just relax! I live super close to this location and have not been to the paradise valley O.H.S.O. But I hear great things. They have delicious sangria and the pretzel boards are so yummy! Best part, pet friendly. Everyone that works there is so nice! Ambiance is fantastic, very well designed, retro and awesome. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Food took for ever. Food wasn't worth the wait. I think my pitcher of beer sat out for a while before it was brought to me, it warmed up and ruined he taste. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I picked my girlfriend up from the service center at Toyota down the street. We caught up while working at OHSO. She loves their mimosas, it's a pretty generous pour in a large glass.   The service was great, nice open area, free WiFi, the food is pretty good. We had some small appetizers and a salad. I would come back for a proper meal although I believe they are better known for their extensive selection of beers."}
{"text":"I love oh so and I went here for brunch on Memorial Day and tried their brunch menu for the first time and it was delicious! I ordered the avocado toast and I loved it. Their brunch comes with a free select drink, I got a mimosa which was yummie! I also had a couple bloody Mary's here which were very, very good. I was sitting on the patio with my friends, my friend brought his dog (ohso is very dog friendly) we had a great time, the vibe here is great and I always recommend this place to people!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have been eating lately has been at restaurants that brew their own craft beer. Outrageous Homebrewer's Social Outpost has three locations currently here in the Valley. This location has a good size patio area with a misting system to help keep the place cool during the hot summer hours. I ordered the pretzel board to start off with and one of their Hefeweizen beers to drink. The board is huge and comes with an awesome green chili cheese dip for your pretzel bread. For dinner I ordered the AZ Burger. The combination of the jalapeño cream and the poblano aioli gave it a nice mild spicy flavor. The layer of crispy onion strings gave a little crunch to eat bite. The burger itself was pretty big. They have a M-F happy hour and the kitchen opens till midnight with discounts on some of the food item. The beer brunch (9am - 2pm) on the weekends is pretty popular. They have several breakfast entrees for $10 that include a beer or a mimosa. O.S.H.O is pet friendly, so you can bring your dog to dine with you if you want."}
{"text":"Came for the first time to do their mimosa brunch.  If you're a food snob like I am, please don't come here. The only delicious item was the mimosa.  When they brought out my breakfast with waffles,  it was all cold. They re made my breakfast and it was still mediocre. They should give up the brunch,  obviously it's not their forte."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some takeout on the way back to Cali from New Mexico. I called 30 minutes ahead to make sure my food is ready so I can grub and sleep for another long drive the next morning. I arrive and tell them I'm there for pick up. They nicely let me know they are finishing it up and will be out shortly.....25 minutes later my food comes out. Half of which was already cold. The place was not busy by any means, so I didn't really understand why the 25 minute delay considering I called 30 minutes beforehand. So to the review:  Food: 4/5: AZ burger was good, Pretzel Board was good and Kale pear salad was ok. Service: 2/5: They are friendly but the long wait for a takeout order called in 30 minutes before arrival and not being a busy day is pretty bad. Ambiance: 3/5: At the time it seemed pretty dead for 8-9pm on a Saturday night. I don't live in AZ so I don't know what their regular busy time is. But this to me would usually be just after prime-time."}
{"text":"Three stars for beer selection. Food was fair. Garlic shrimp tacos was ordered but they forgot the garlic. The condiments was enough for one taco. Carne Asado tacos had a good flavor. But again the condiments only enough for one taco.  Green chile dip not worth ordering, very bland. It was an appetizer."}
{"text":"Update, this is a couple months late, but we went to OHSO for brunch this time. I live in Orange County. Brunch is a big deal. There is a place down the street from us that claims to have good fruity pebble french toast. It is not. OHSO has the best fruity pebble french toast there's ever been + a 1 cent beer. This place is fantastic. Service is great, food is great, beers are great, liquors are great. We will definitely make OHSO one of our go tos from here on out when we visit Scottsdale/Phoenix."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The menu sounded fantastic however once ordered and served nothing good. The Mac and cheese was nothing more than a generic box of kraft. Service was not good either. Had to repeat requests several times before it was right. Bummed!"}
{"text":"I come here after work a lot for happy hours. Audrey is the best. She is spectacularly attentive and personable. Big fan. Food is good, beer is good, and Audrey is good."}
{"text":"We used to always go to their Arcadia area cause of the patio setting but now we go to this one here in Scottsdale (closer to house) has a great atmosphere, fun little patio and service is stellar. If going for breakfast you gotta get the brats and a beer but lunch is free game. So many good options to choose from!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed OHSO. Awesome patio that is dog friendly. Fantastic service. Wonderful food with lots of great choices burgers, salads, and other items. And lots of great IPA beers. My favorite was the orange blossom! Another great feature is that it is completely family-friendly too. You will love this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so laid back and relaxing! I really enjoyed that. I went with my boyfriend for the first time. We walked in right around 4pm and it wasn't too busy but there was a decent amount of people at the bar top and patio. Their patio is really nice and has many tables! We decided to sit inside at one of their high top tables.   Our server came over in a few mins with waters and gave us a min to decide on drinks. It was also happy hour so a pitcher of beer was 6$ and so was any cocktail/ wine. I asked her what she recommended and she said the summertime cocktail was her favorite. I got that and it was amazing! It tasted sweet and refreshing! My boyfriend got a pitcher  of Hoppy IPA beer, he said he really liked it.   For an appetizer we had the Thai Hummus. The hummus was very good, however the pita bread that they served with it was very stiff and hard. Kinda disappointing.   For entrees I had the \"Burger and cheese\" burger, it had Gouda cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce and tomato with their special sauce. The server asked me if I wanted my burger pink or not pink. I have never heard of this at any other place, I'm always used to saying medium well or well done. I guess they only serve it two ways?! Anyways the burger was good but nothing special. It was a little dry and bland. I didn't really taste the sauce in it. Again not amazing but good. My boyfriend got the \"grilled salmon BLT burger\", his was a little dry for him as well. The heroes in our entrees were the French fries, I got regular, he got sweet potato. They were the best fries I have ever had! Each one was crisp to perfection!!   Overall the service  was really good and the atmosphere is great! It's a perfect place to come to and wind down for the day. I would totally go back for the drinks and the service alone! The food was nothing to brag about, but still good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and pretty good service, but the food was just okay. We started with the steak fries, which had a great flavor. The steak was cooked well, but had a char flavor, which isn't my personal favorite. We also had the kale and pear salad (good) and the brisket sandwich (not good). The sandwich tasted like a sub-par sloppy joe; it was too wet, with a soggy bun. We had the brownie skillet which wasn't amazing either- it wasn't very chocolatey and we both though it has too much flour or something."}
{"text":"Nice spot to drop by and have a few beers, they only have 3 of their own available on tap which is sort of a bummer but they make up for that by having 12-18 other craft beers on tap. Great patio, dog friendly. Did't eat but the food looked great, will be back to try the food. Four Stars."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, ok food. Dog friendly patio with excellent attention to both people and the pups! I could not have been happier with the service.  I had the breakfast sandwich for brunch, so maybe it was just my ordering skills that were lacking.  I will definitely be back, this place was great! Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Love the west coast beach cruiser hipster vibe. Excellent choose of brews and great local ones! Fantastic service and bartenders are in too of it and always cleaning the bar :) love it and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, food and drinks! Kelsey our server was great. She helped us pick the right food for our pallet. Everyone was very attentive! Eric the GM was a pleasure to speak with. We sampled many different beers and had a taste of Ohso's peach whiskey! If you are in the Scottsdale area this is a must stop. Again great people, food and drink!!"}
{"text":"This place as great...came here for a mimosa and breakfast after a run...,from the drinks to the food to the amazingly friendly customer service! I'd rather pay a few bucks more for my drink and food here...but not much more....than ever go back to the PV OHSO in Tatum!   I'm not a fan of the PV Shea and Tatum OSHO because I've sat at the bar and had drunks push me over to make space for more of their drink friends....and the Management is horrible....they defend the drunk customers to not deal with confrontation.....and just to get a buck...just not right! This place not only has great customer service, bar tenders but great neighborhood customers too!!!"}
{"text":"Always have to visit this place for Brunch.  Best place for Brunch in AZ.    Always bring grandkids and dog friendly too!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very yummy. We split an AZ burger (which was amazing) and carne asada tacos. Great service and they allow dogs which is great!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a quick dinner with my sisters, who brought their dog. Very pet-friendly place, they offer free homemade dog treats and bring a bowl of water over to your table for the pup. The patio is very nice, fans and plenty of umbrellas/canopies. We shared the crab dip and ahi tuna wonton appetizers, was plenty to share between the three of us. I ordered the mac del mar, which was DELICIOUS. My sisters shared the chicken mac and the pear and kale salad, both of which were great too. They have a great beer selection with lots of local AZ offerings. Good prices for the portions and food came out pretty quickly! Would like to come back and try the brunch next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Had a *fantastic* meal here last weekend!  Great beer selection, with a large portion of the menu dedicated to locally-brewed options (try the Dragoon IPA, it's everything they say it is).  Our server, Lindsey, said she was new, but it didn't seem that way--she knew her way around the menu & helped us get stoked on something to order.   Food came out quickly--hot food hot, cold food cold...they nailed it, we'll be back."}
{"text":"i swung in here yesterday for lunch .i took my spot at the bar i found the service excellent especially the beautiful young gal behind the bar very effeciant and proffesional . the menu is pretty much basic bar food lots of burgers , i scaned the menu 3/4 times looking for something that caught my eye but ended up having a burg which was good."}
{"text":"Up in north Scottsdale for a soccer tournament with 3 hours to kill in between matches with our kids. We look up on yelp where to go and we decide on OHSO.  So....a total of 20 PLUS arrive together, seated promptly and waitress comes to take our order.  I wasn't going to give 5 stars because the dramatic heavy sigh and over done eye roll when we ask for seperate checks. But she pulled through it all.  I know it sucks, a big pain in the butt......deal with it. Other than that, she was on point and a very attentive waitress. $10 brunch menu AND a mimosa, beer or bloody mary? HOW IS THIS PLACE NOT PACKED?? Bagel and Lox was hands down he best I've ever had and the mimosa was 90% champagne!! My type of pour!   Day 2......We're back again.....3 hours to kill. I arrived before the rest of team and requested the section to the right of the patio and promptly seated, we had it all to ourselves. Good move, especially with 10 hyped up boys playing soccer.  This time we had it all on one check........not because of me, but because someone in our group volunteered to put it on his CC.......smh. I hate that.  I had the breakfast wrap and 2 mimosa's!  I wish I didn't live in the east valley, I would be here every weekend!!   Staff is a 10 here. The food was great and the drinks were outstanding"}
{"text":"First visit was a fail. AC was not working and it was hot. Ordered red wine and it was served ICE COLD! When I complained the server had no idea what was wrong with cold red wine. One drink and left for 4 peaks. Second visit was better. I hope they keep improving as I love the original in Arcadia."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!! Haven't had a bad service experience so far..  The BBQ burger and Salmon BLT are delicious and sangrias there are my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Good brunch with a great selection of beers. The breakfast bowl was filling and a perfect way to start the day while also putting food on your stomach before sharing flights. An open air environment that makes you feel like you're on the patio even if you are inside. It was 113 the day we went but even with the garage doors up, the AC and huge ceiling fans actually made it a bit chilly."}
{"text":"My experience at O.H.S.O was great! I was invited for lunch during a work day with my colleagues and showed up there at around 12:30. The place was pretty full and my colleagues were already there waiting for me. We were given the menus and they gave us a few minutes to review it. Our server returned to our table slightly later than we needed her to but that was fine. I picked the carne Asada tacos with flour tortillas and one my colleagues had the same with half flour and half corn tortillas. My other two colleagues ordered Pastrami sandwiches.   The food was served in about 15 min. I expected the tacos to be assembled but they came de-assembled, no problem! They were served with 2 small sides of salsa and guacamole and they were served with 4 tortillas. I dug in and the food was delicious! The meat was very flavorful and juicy it was great!   Since I was there for lunch, I didn't have much time to spend there however I liked the food so much I am definitely going back and recommending the restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"What a great place! This is what brunch is all about. Great atmosphere, very friendly and upbeat staff...cool people that actually eat here...good vibes, and clean! You cant beat the $10 brunch menu. plenty of food with a large strong mimosa included. We left satisfied and happy knowing that there is still hope for good food and vibes without over paying in the valley...reminded me of brunch places back east that serve great food without robbing you."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and either many people are still doing the same or it's just that good! There was about a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night. My burger was good and there's plenty on the menu I'd love to go back and try. The patio is great, but it's too hot for that right now and they try to cool it down with misters and fans, but they've basically made the side tables unusable because they get soaked.   The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the service and the atmosphere - the servers blend in too much and just look like patrons. I get the relaxed look, but throw on an apron or something! Also, ours was MIA a lot. There were a lot of large groups - kids and drunk adults, essentially acting the same - which is just slightly obnoxious. It lacked the busy, but relaxed feel of Four Peaks, instead just feeling busy and chaotic.   Also, any new bar coming to sleepy North Scottsdale creates a buzz, but this one disappointed just the same as the existing bars because they also close up at about midnight or 1am, even on weekends."}
{"text":"A happy ending to the story... The manager of this location wanted to right the wrongs and provided me a $50 gift card. Two friends and I ate great food and drank refreshing cocktails.  It's so nice to see businesses do the right thing to retain their customers. BTW THE SWEET POTATO FRIES ARE CRAZY ADDICTIVE!"}
{"text":"Great food & phenomenal service! Dane is the best waiter & extremely personable. The North Scottsdale location is MUCH better than the PV location. Strongly recommend you go & ask for Dane."}
{"text":"Service is very poor. The \"manager\" is rude, and the drinks SUCK. watered down and over priced. The \"menu after 10\" is a few shitty options and the \"manager\" rudely informed us \"everything is locked up and put away!\" when we asked if we could get the cheese plate option. He was really horrible and condescending about it. Its just cold cheese, what is it under lock and key? Sure the food is ok, but the wait staff just makes the place unbearable. If you go, don't go late."}
{"text":"Love this place! Recently moved to Phoenix and every time someone comes to visit me I have to take them here. The blackened salmon tacos are so out of this world amazing. Oh and I'm picky about the vodka I drink and their #vodka is incredibly smooth."}
{"text":"They changed the menu took the good stuff off....shrunk the portions basically this place went from our favorite to we will never go back again"}
{"text":"The service was so crappy at Four Peaks we left, walked around the corner and found this place! The service was like night and day. The bartender here was awesome, he even took a few minutes to teach us old farts how to use Uber. I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. It's hard to screw up a burger but you'd be surprised how many places make a lousy one.  Yeah, next time I'm in town, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am frequently visiting the OHSO on Indian School Road and enjoy the dog friendly atmosphere and food. I went to the phoenix pet expo and decided to go to this OHSO location, and I have to say it is nothing like my past experiences at my ideal location. The patio was dog friendly also so I brought my dog, service was slow and waitresses switched off and took turns on who to come. Fries were stale and cold and sandwiches were ok temp. I hated this experience and would never try this location again. Nothing was done about my food when I warned them and I asked for a disposable bowl for my dog to get water because they were out and I was never brought one, luckily the people next to us noticed and gave us the one they had before they left... Would appreciate if something was done about this experience"}
{"text":"I had the green chili skillet and the boyfriend had the brisket sandwich. Both were yummy! The skillet didn't overfill my tummy. I actually left hungry.  The brisket sandwich was delicious and just the right amount of food. We shared a four part flight of beer- quite a deal for $6. This place is both a brewery and a distillery, offering a variety of local choices in many types of booze. Our only complaint is that we got a new server. I'm sure he'll be amazing in a matter of a few days, but he offered tastings that he never brought and as soon as he got cut we were left hanging with the promise that someone would be around."}
{"text":"We stopped by with the kids after a movie at SMG and had a very nice dinner.  Our server was fantastic and we enjoyed the beer and all our food.  We shared the ahi tuna stack appetizer and the Mac del mar.  Both were very good.  Lots of shrimp in the Mac del mar.  Service was great.  Like the Upslope and MR black IPA."}
{"text":"One of the managers, Summer, was so helpful! She took time out of her day off to help me get reservations for a large party. She was great! Thank you Summer!"}
{"text":"Came for a dinner meeting last week. There were 5 of us and we sat outdoors, which was tolerable at 6:30pm in the shade and mist. I wasn't hungry much as I typically don't eat until after 8 or 9pm (it's an east coast thing I think) but the ribs were ordered and chips and salsa as well as a until huge salad. Ribs looked soft but the presentation was a bit off putting. The mini pitchers were a highlight and the attentive service of refills and check-ins was prompt. Overall I would say 3.5 stars but the service put it to 4."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after a friend of my wife's recommended the chocolate beer they serve. The beer was excellent. The food was just average. It lacks flavor and was one step above food serve.  Grilled cheese was below par. The tomato marmalade was very subtle which was not good. The cheese had little flavor. It was also not cooked long enough and was soggy.   Seafood Mac and cheese had little to no flavor. There was an abundance of shrimp though which was great.   Sweet potato fries were food service for sure. Just ok.   Carmel apple pie by pie snob. Clearly the best thing we ate. Wow. I would come back just for this. Better yet I think we will just pick up some pie from pie snob. :)  Pretzel bread stick and cheese sauce was the highlight for me. Piping hot pretzel bread stick. They don't have this by itself only in a board that is 12 bucks with other stuff I didn't want. I asked for just the pretzels with some of the jalapeño cheese sauce.  She brought me 1 cut in half and about 1 tbls of cheese sauce. It was great but really there was were 2 of use I think at least 2 would have been more appropriate. I ordered a second one right away but it took over 5 min to come so kind of a let down.   Service was spotty. They had one server for the whole place at about 3pm on a Monday when we went. There were like 6 other tops when we'rel there so service was slow.   Overall 3/5 for food and 3/5 for Service."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here while visiting for spring training. This place is incredible. We had some of their brewed beer. The choices we picked were great. The servers were very knowledgeable and were able to help us make our selections. Then came the food. We had the brisket mac, mac Del Mar, beer braised short ribs, and the chicken and waffles. All of the food was fantastic. The two mac and cheese options were both amazing but very different. The syrup for the chicken and waffles was incredible, it was sweet and spicy. Could have taken a bath in that sauce. The ribs were falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. We may be hitting this place for dinner again before we return home. 5 stars well deserved."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've had burgers and salads both were very tasty.  The beer selection is wonderful, service is prompt and the atmosphere perfect. Also dog friendly! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I'll give them the 3stars  for service,  which was outstanding however the beer was flat, carne asada tacos... full of great not very tasty fat. Felt like eating a wet sock.  looking at the menu I felt there was a lack of creativity just  boring food,  I was wrong. It was not only tasteless but  also really poor quality.  There goes the biggest waste of time. However  the manager covered the tab, that I appreciate. It keeps me from completely writing  the place off my list."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Lunch for 2 with Diet Cokes $35, so expensive, too. Given the dozens of food choices in the area I'd recommend trying someplace else."}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday and sat outside with our dogs.  That was a plus right there.  I try to avoid gluten so being that they had gluten free beer (Mission IPA) which is fantastic - have some at home, and gluten free menu, both were cranking on that 5 star rating.  Several people came over to pet our dog, one brought them water, and just all around friendly staff.  Our waiter was a bit late on the greet and then took a while to bring me my beer.  That was the low point of the experience.  Other than that, very tasty food and with the right table (near the big fan) the outdoor seating is doable.  At first we sat in the middle out by the road which was away from the fan and before 1pm has the sun still hitting you."}
{"text":"Great food and great place to bring your dog. Sitting outside is a treat and the service is good and quick. I love the steak frites and the camelback drink. The Tatum location has an excellent outside area with games and a bat."}
{"text":"Enjoy everything about this spot. Sangria was on point and fresh and food and service was great  It's a little loud. But its worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of OHSO. No doubt about it. I used to frequent the location in the Arcadia area. When we moved up to North Scottsdale I missed being so close and was super happy when they opened this location.   I have now been twice. The people, food, and service are always stellar. The only small problem that I have run into both times is the draft beer. Although they have tons of option both local and from all over the beer is consistently not cold. The summer here is brutal and one of the things I enjoy most is sipping on an ice-cold beer. Sadly I have not had that experience here yet.   For food, their burgers are amazing. The sweet buns they serve are increadible. I wish I could bring some home.  All in all, I really like OHSO. I will be back and I will be crossing my fingers that the drafts have cooled off...."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with ohso!!! It is my favorite place to grab happy hour with friends! I love the atmosphere! I highly recommend trying ohso!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  I didn't like that I couldn't choose how I wanted my meat cooked.  So my friend and I decided to just order a side of sweet potato fries.  Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Loved the customer service we got from David. Very nice guy! The food was amazing - husband ordered AZ burger and gave it a 10/10!! Great strawberry beer as well:)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came in a recommendation from a friend. Interior was industrial and bicycles are the main theme in decor. Large outdoor patio with misters and misting fans. We sat inside and my friend ordered a Mac n cheese w seafood that was to die for! I ordered the egg salad with blue cheese. Holy moly! This dish was interesting and so good. Never would have thought to pair egg salad w blue cheese crumbles. SO GOOD, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  The drinks were interesting but delicious! I had a Bloody Mary and it was tasty and slightly spicy. We met friends there and it was a great atmosphere to catch up. I noticed the patio allows fur babies!! HUGE ASSET! Next time we are in the area, we will return!!!"}
{"text":"This place was OK.  I would give it 3.5 stars. A bit overhyped I think.  It was pleasant.  Service was good and staff was friendly.  The food was ok.  For a distillery, I expected more of their own options of beer and liquor to choose from.  There were only two of their beers on tap, both fruity flavored.  No lager or Pilsner or other to choose from.  They do offer plenty of other local brews.  To really sum this place up, I would say OHSO is a good happy hour spot.  Meet a few folks after work, have a few brews and snacks and then move on.  I'll try the place again.  One visit isn't fair enough to judge overall.  They have a brunch and bbq offering on Saturdays and Sunday's.  Might need to try.  This bar would work at a location closer to homes.  Take the dog for a walk down the street and have a brew and snack.  Not at this location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food, best Bloody Mary I ever had and sooooooo dog friendly! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came in this morning for their $10 brunch and beer special and was not disappointed. My wife and I sat on the patio and enjoyed a delicious OHSO hefeweizen, a cool and sweet mimosa, the steak and eggs burrito with guacamole and the lox and bagels.  The service was great, it seemed our waiter was always nearby to refill our drinks on the warm patio. Not long after we got there, they turned on the misters, which made the experience much more enjoyable. The food was delicious; the burrito was simple and savory, and my wife loved the lox (you build your own sandwich, which she likes better). For everything we got, $10/plate with beer is a fantastic deal!  I think the thing I like most about this place was the atmosphere. Every member of the staff were friendly, even bringing out water and snacks to the canine customers. The local beer selection is one of the best I've seen.  I highly recommend this place, we may be making OHSO a staple for our weekend brunches to come."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch, first time ever. I ordered the French toast and my husband got a breakfast wrap. The food was good. The service was barely fair. The server had a difficult time checking on a food allergy and told us \"the kitchen is slammed so we can't really look right now\" and basically told us they can't guarantee anything as far as food allergies. Sorry, I've worked in EVERY position in food service....you always check on ingredients for an allergy....it's just good customer service and it's a safety thing. She didn't appreciate the push back and we didn't appreciate the attitude. Anyway, eventually the manager came out and let us know that the food did not have the possible allergen.  The server never brought refills for water and just generally avoided our table. Just a tip for O.H.S.O., coach your staff on the best way to handle food allergies. We didn't ask for anything other than an ingredient list....which most restaurants and breweries offer. I'm not sure if we'll give this place another chance. Four peaks is just down the street and we get treated better there."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time on Friday night - Happy Hour. The burgers are the best in the area. I think it has a lot to do with the very fresh, soft buns they use.  I had the Diablo burger and I highly recommend it.  The fries are ok, but they would better if they were a bit more meaty (thicker). I was back again on Saturday night and had another burger. The atmosphere is very good and the service has been great for all three times I've been there.  Yes, I went for their brunch after church today.  A great value which includes a beer or Mimosa. The only reason I didn't give Five stars is because the beer isn't cold enough. Yes, I know......micro brew purists will tell me that beer should be at such and such (foo, foo) temperature.  But, I don't care, this isn't Germany where they serve the beer at room temperature.  I like my beer \"brain freeze\" cold.    Well, OK, if i can't have it \"brain freeze\" cold, then how about a bit colder than it was. The first night my buddy and I split a pitcher.  The beer in pitcher was \"cool\", but definitely not cold.  I was also give a glass that was warm out of the dishwasher - A BIG NO, NO.  I had to ask for a glass of ice to add to my beer (another purist NO, NO, i am sure).   For me a cold beer is not an afterthought to what I am eating - it is equally important.  I give this restaurant an overall high score for food, atmosphere and service, but a thumbs down for the temperature of the beer.  I wish they'd serve beer in a frosted pitcher after it comes out of a cold tap, and I'll drink in a frosted glass - yea!! However, I will be back.  I'll be the one pouring my pitcher of beer over a glass of ice."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service. Food was great as well. Waiter we had was very young but had a great personality and when asked about his likes and dislikes of the menu he was very respectful of his employer but also gave us some valuable tips."}
{"text":"Nice to have a great bar in this neighborhood!  Great drinks!  Amazing happy hour specials!  Excellent service, good food, dog friendly and great variety. So excited this opened in this location. It was so needed!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and the Boom! Dynamite I.P.A. has too be my favorite beer right now! Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. There were four of us at the brewery and we had a great time. Had the dragoon IPA at happy hour. We had the green Chile pork skillet and sweet potato fries. Keri Ann was our server and she did a great job! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Highly recommend the chicken and waffles. Brunch was awesome!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Great happy hour till 6pm. Pretzel and cheese appetizer is great."}
{"text":"The staff is exceptional. I've had different people every time and everyone helps out different tables which really makes you feel taken care of.   Burgers are awesome. I've had the AZ burger and the Diablo burger which are both fantastic. Their friends are good but I especially love the asparagus side instead of fries. Very tasty indeed!"}
{"text":"This is a super hipster place. You can even bring your dog to brunch with you! We got a nice table in the back. The brunch menu is a great deal too. They have a beer and brunch for 10$. It's a fun place!"}
{"text":"We did a short staycation in Scottsdale and were trying to go to places we don't usually frequent. That is how we decided on this place.  It was a little too 'trendy' for our taste, but not in a pretentious way. We took a glance at the menu and we almost left, but our server (Kami I think) was very upbeat and accommodating, she made some recommendations and we ended up staying. Hubby had the angry bird sandwich and I had the Arizona burger. I upgraded to a polenta side, which was very tasty and creamy (I was expecting polenta like at Fogo the Chao, little sticks similar in size to a cheese stick, however it was more like cream cheese consistency).  I liked the fact that they have women's, men's, and a unisex restroom. The host was also very welcoming and friendly. They seem to have a really good vibe going on, just we were not very drawn to the food options. Although original and creative, somehow we struggled to find something we wanted."}
{"text":"First time I tried this place was with my entire family from California, they were visiting. Our server was awkward and rude and on medication from a dentist appointment because he apparently has \"surgery.\" DONT HAVE HIM SERVE AND SEND HIS ASS HOME!! The next time I ordered the BBQ burger. I ordered it medium rare and came out well done with cold fries. When I asked for hot fries the waitress acted like it was an Inconvenience. It was 40+ minutes later the fries come back after the burger was well gone by then. Beer was warm too. This place sucks and the people that work there look miserable."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to have the opportunity to visit again and meet the artist Greg and learn of his craftsmanship! Take a tour and learn about the Arcadia liquors!"}
{"text":"GREAT, love taking our sweet dog here! yummy mimosas and lox and bagel"}
{"text":"You've got to love dog-friendly restaurants. Dogs just inject more joy into any situation they're in, and whenever I can hang out with my pughuahua, Chico Hombre, I'm thrilled.  Chico and I headed to the new O.H.S.O. Eatery + Distillery in north Scottsdale, where servers deliver fresh water bowls to tables with pooches on the patio, along with a bag of treats to keep them busy while you get your pub and grub on. Each table has a carabiner you can tie your leash to, and Chico had a blast entertaining the guests around us.  Sip on a brewskie from the extensive beer list featuring dozens of options, or get a mimosa ($6), like I did.  For dinner, my companion loved his turkey burger and fries ($12), while my grilled cheese on ciabatta with avocado and tomato and a side salad  ($12) was might tasty.  The patio had fans to cool people off, and the staff was super-friendly and professional. The Arcadia location of O.H.S.O. has always been one of my faves, and I'm stoked they've opened one in Scottsdale.   Download the O.H.S.O. app to reserve a brew-your-own-beer night with your friends. It's $50 to reserve a spot, but you get a $50 gift card to come back and drink your creation. How awesome is that?"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for lunch last week.  The food was good, and came out quickly.  Our server was nice and checked on us often.  I really liked their menu and overall vibe. Good job OHSO"}
{"text":"Solid place to go when you want great food and drinks. This location is smaller than the Paradise Valley (Tatum & Shea) location but it still has a relaxing vibe. Plenty of outdoor seating available. Highly recommend the chips and guac appetizer. Really like the nice touch of fresh corn and pumpkin seeds used in the presentation. There's a great variety of salads, sandwiches and dinner options. I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I just had the chicken and kale soup, which is listed as a side, but honestly it was hearty enough that I felt full due to the generous portion size. My husband enjoyed his blackened salmon. There are several TVs that air the latest sporting event around the bar, so this is definitely a great spot to try if you want to enjoy a great meal and watch a game."}
{"text":"I have been here three times since the opening last week! I would say I am a big fan! We love their happy hour deals, that's mostly what we've come for. Their calamari and Ahi app is cooked to perfection! Their shrimp tacos are very tasty. N the Thai   hummus with cucumbers and carrots are very tasty but not spicy. I also love that they bring you cucumber water as soon as you arrive and are seated. The staff is all very friendly, and quite helpful if you're not sure what you're looking for. We will be coming here a lot of the next few months!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out OSHO for the first time, we had a local dines or groupon or whatever coupon my wife found.  We brought our two dogs as we heard this was very dog friendly (from what I heard the other one on Tatum is better for the fury friends).  We arrived and the hostess was very friendly and very cordial to our dogs. I ordered the salmon BLT, the salmon was very dry though I probably would give it another try as the server had recommended it so maybe it was just an off night. The staff was great and our dogs were treated like royalty."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They are one of the few dog friendly places in the area and they take it seriously.  They offer dog treats and always give my neurotic dog lots of love and attention.  Service is outstanding with a great selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"This place is always fun. The patio is small but inviting. We had bottomless mimosas w/ our chicken & waffles. Our server was timely & friendly. Unfortunately there is a bank being built right in front of this location, so views will soon be obstructed on the patio. We will still return though."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for another OHSO and couldn't remember which one so we ended up at the Indian School Rd location......WHICH....DI NOT DISSAPOINT! Great spot. caught some Fottball. Great steak Fries!! and that dumb Cheese Dip!! holly SHi*! I believe they ran out of chips because of us!! :) Overall great food, atmosphere, and service! I will be visiting them all this winter and keep updating my review!"}
{"text":"I love this place! 10 dollar monster mimosa & brunch entree- no one can beat it!  I love the flatbread here too! GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, I had the Az Burger,and my wife had the ensalada del sol salad. Both were delicious. We sat outside which was nice, not hectic, albeit nothing to look at but parking lot, but hey great conversation. Gave us a little tour of the \"Pocket Brewery\" Nice touch, we enjoyed the food and the service"}
{"text":"Mimosa + brunch entree before 3:00 is just $15!!   Legit mimosas, 15 minute wait on a crowded Saturday, and the best spot for all dog lovers."}
{"text":"Brought our puppy to the patio. They treated us like we belonged there. Everyone loved the dog, service was great and food was on point as well. They put on sports games as we requested, solid local beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Nice ambience but hate the vegetarian food .. Specially the veg patty.. Tasteless and cold .. Felt like they just look out do deep freeze and did not heat up properly .. Also the food was served after 40 min !!! I love the other Ohso location but disappointed with this 1"}
{"text":"I'm going to echo the sentiment of another reviewer and say awesome atmosphere and experience, and just so-so food. This is the kind of place you're better off sticking with a burger. I had the Kahlua pork entree which wasn't bad and I LOVED that I was able to get a sampler of many of the local beers. Really dug the White Chocolate from Sonoran brewery.  We had great service and a lovely table outside in the sun surrounded by dogs and Giants Fans for Spring Training. Bonus points for having freshly baked dog biscuits. The mutt woulda really loved it, but she refuses to fly coach out to Arizona.  Would definitely want to check out their Sunday backyard BBQ next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to OHSO in two years, but I decided to give it another try today for brunch. Glad I did because I enjoyed it! Was fun seeing the dogs on the patio, I like the open set up of the restaurant.  The brunch menu is small, but the food looked tasty! Most things were easily modified to be vegetarian which was a plus.  I ended up ordering the avocado toast without bacon. It was good but idk how you could mess that up anyways haha. I was happy! The potatoes were yummy too. I also could've had a mimosa with it but I wasn't really in the mood, so I will next time! I was filled up by my meal which was good! The portion was a good size, not massive but not too small. It was a good price too! Also I got to try a bite of the fruity pebble french toast and it was very sweet, but a fun unique breakfast.  The service was great too, they were energetic and checked up on us frequently, kept our waters filled! The service was probably the highlight, they rocked it. I totally want to come back to try dinner again."}
{"text":"Great service, Awesome selection of cocktails and beer! Shared the olives, and Hummus which was delicious!  I enjoyed their version of the Moscow Mule because they have a house ginger mix.  Great Location!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a bad experience at Fourpeaks and wow were we pleasantly surprised all staff are so chill and relaxed and love to chat you up or play with your dog.  We love the patio and atmosphere and much prefer this to the typical menu of most brew pubs."}
{"text":"Cool place, great beer list, decent food.  The service is pretty slow and the misters outside were all jacked up, so they had to turn them off when it was 105 degrees outside.  That made a cool patio into a sweatbox.  Hopefully they get their shit together a bit more in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service greaT,  clean fun place, you must try this place .yum yum"}
{"text":"Solid food, delicious beer. Service at the bar was great- very friendly. We enjoyed a few beers and split a patty melt. It was all delicious but my only complaint is the majority of menu is a bit on the high side price wise.  Each item seems to be a just a Few dollars higher than what it should be. Still a good option and we will likely return."}
{"text":"We split the Carnitas breakfast and it was good, not great.  Kind of plain jane.  Plus the service was not great.  I don't know about you, but when I ask the waitress for something, and she finishes her rather long conversation with the bartender before getting us what we need, it puts me off.  To be fair, I came here a couple of months ago and had great food and service.  Last time I got the surf and turf...spicy as hell...and great."}
{"text":"Ohso is always a great place ! Came in today and had Tristan as our bartender ! Not only was he willing to accommodate everything we asked for but also willing   To take two steps above an beyond to make sure we were happy . Always good food and mimosas are great ! Would recommend to anyone for a day off or just to stop for a drink after work."}
{"text":"I'll happily add my name to the long list of people that love OHSO. I've been going to the location on Indian School for years. The vibe at all locations is fun and chill and the food is pretty stellar too! I also find that the service is consistent and always pleasant. This particular location took me a minute to find but once I was inside I felt at home! I sat up at the bar and ordered myself one of their giant, dangerous mimosas. I love going to eat alone, but it sucks that I have to make a choice and only order one item from their awesome menu. I went for the pastrami sandwich. This was the first thing I ever ordered all those years ago at my first visit and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. Well folks, it did not disappoint! The pickle and pepper mix, mustard aioli, fontina, grilled onion, and Italian dressing was the perfect mix of flavor without being overpowering. I would happily order it again!"}
{"text":"What a great job they did on Mother's Day brunch. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks were good, food was great, bartender was really nice."}
{"text":"I've been to a few O.H.S.O. and food and service has been consistently good and this place was no exception.  Came here for lunch one day and I enjoyed their food. We shared salad and fish tacos and both were good.  What they serve here is mostly bar food, dishes are made to go well with beer. If you don't drink, good to share with a group as food tends to get heavy after a while."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town for the quality, service and prices! Their mimosas are champagne with a slight touch of orange juice in a wine size glass! Another plus is you can bring man's best friend to join in the dining experience. A definite weekly must if you're a local."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, fast and friendly service. The brunch deal on Saturday and Sunday is awesome (a meal and a drink for $10). For an L.A. Native, you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"It's Christmas Eve and my family and I didn't really feel like cooking a meal after church so we swung by O.H.S.O. in hopes it was open.  WOW, what a great experience.  Dane waited on us and the service and the food was fantastic.  I believe the Chicken & Waffles that my daughter ordered could feed a family of four all by itself.  mmmmmmmm good"}
{"text":"Ordered the two cheese boards, the artichoke dip, pretzel dip and the hummus dip. Overall, it's not bad, and the service is pretty good. The outdoor patio is nice, and it kinda reminds me of a more relaxed and casual bar and grill in some way. It's hard to explain but it has a good atmosphere. I think the patio is awesome, and it's great to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, food and amazing booze selection. I come here at least once a week since moving here 7 months ago.  The outdoor patio is amazing, I have yet to sit inside. They allow dogs & even bring bones and water for them. Their menu is huge; they have everything from tacos, to burgers and their salads are so good.  Everyone I've brought here also loves it. I highly recommend the steak fries for an appetizer and the tacos or grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"They always have very fun and helpful bartenders.  Their selection of craft beers is one of the best in town.  Their HH appetizers are a little weak but their burger and bbq pork and brisket are very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not because of the location but mainly because of the VERY nice staff here! Shout out to Greg our waiter and Mariana the hostess. They are the best!! Such nice people. First time at this location and will be back because of them! My fav OHSO in yhe valley!"}
{"text":"Ahhh-maaaa-zzzing. We LOVE this place. Awesome, delicious menu....great atmosphere...drinks are off the charts. Cant wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good drinks, cool ambiance and somewhat friendly service. The recipe is right for a good spot."}
{"text":"Visited the North Scottsdale Location of OHSO, after being intrigued after driving by the Phoenix location. Excellent vibe, great beer, great food. I ordered \"The Gobbler\", a turkey burger with pear compote and greens. It was delicious! The turkey was flavorful and not dry, and the pear compote was a perfect compliment. We also ordered a blue crab dip appetizer, which I could have passed on, only because I thought it was a bit overpriced for the size. Great draft beer selection!! I will definitely be back-- next time with my pooch!"}
{"text":"We've had good experiences at other locations but had a really bad one here. We left with the impression that they had little concern for their customers and their experience.  Beginning with the hostess mocking my young daughter and her stuffed doll (not so quietly in front of us) and ending with our server rolling her eyes and acting visibly annoyed at a simple request regarding our bill, we left not wanting to return here again.   Good food, value, rude/terrible service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Atmosphere is super fun and I love that they have a dog area! Love the $1 beer testers as well! Great place for happy hours with friends. Can be quite cramped inside but, has a lot of outdoor seating. Great service as well."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for happy hour on a Saturday and we had a great time. We tried several different beers all of which were delicious. Our waiter was friendly. The pulled pork sandwich was to die for. So much food it actually put us in a food coma. went home to take a nap. I will definitely be back soon. Don't forget your dog!"}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly grown on me! I used to think of OHSO as just okay but each time I go back (it's very close to where I live and people I know like to go) I find something that makes me like it more. My favorite beer there is the OHSO Brite. Crisp, light and fresh. Their diablo burger is awesome as is their green chile pork skillet. Their blackened salmon tacos are amaaazing so I imagine that their blackened salmon dish would be too.   They're also dog friendly!! We've brought our pup here a couple of times now and they're always so kind to him and offer him treats & water."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago. Food was good, I had the Cuban sandwich without the mustard and relish and it was quite authentic. Service was good, patio is nice. The vibe is a little 'hipster' (bleck) for my neighborhood so I'm not really sure how that's going to work out for them up here. One can only hope their intent to keep that atmosphere won't alienate potential customers. I will be going back to check it out again."}
{"text":"I really love coming here, the gluten free options are delicious and they have quite a few."}
{"text":"O.H.S.O. has great vibes, good food, and a solid collection of beers. Everything is brewed in house and pairs well with the upscale \"bar food\" options available. It's a great place to hang with friends or chill on the patio with your pup(s)."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos and wine! I like the music, the flat screens for watching hockey and the people watching. Great food!"}
{"text":"We come here often since it's dog friendly! He likes the change up of beers and they are always very kind about our dog. We usually get burgers and they are good! Mimosas are a definite win here. The biggest thing I appreciate is recently our dog threw up (twice) and I was mortified but one woman cleaned it up super quick and was SO nice and even our waiter was really kind and reassured us it was no big deal. Whether it was or not to them, they made us feel less embarrassed and continued to give good service! Just an added bonus to good food and a casual atmosphere!! If you have a dog, this is s good place to go!! When weather permits lol."}
{"text":"New location same great vibe and service! $10 brunch and beer or Mimosa. The menu is a little different but still great, I'm hoping they add the salmon and pita to their menu. Location is great for kids and families."}
{"text":"I am glad that this location opened up closer to home than the original restaurant.  I hit up OHSO recently as a lunch option while my parents were in town.  That is what this review is for.  We all opted for sandwiches - I had the AZ burger, but substituted for a veggie patty.  This was indulgent - I could eat only a few bites, then took the rest to go.  If you are a reluctant vegetarian, this may be a good burger option for you, as I really thought the texture/appearance appeared like meat, which just freaked me out a bit.  The fries (both the sweet potato & regular) were spot on.  I'd love a whole plate of them next time!  My parents enjoyed their sandwiches.  There was a nice beer list as well.    The brunch menu looked more up my alley, but wasn't an option for a weekday lunch.  Something to check out next time!  The ambiance was nice - you don't feel like you are in a strip mall when you are dining.  The decor is young and inviting.  Service was great - no complaints here!"}
{"text":"I love OHSO, both locations, plus it's the best dog friendly place in town. Food is good and they are always coming up with new flavors. The patio at this one is going to expand soon so even better"}
{"text":"Had not been here in a couple of weeks but use to come on the regular for brunch. Today it seemed like the food was in mass production.(5 minutes from ordering to served) Our food came out cold we sent it back and it came out no better we ate most of it because we were so hungry. But I have felt sick all day!  Disappointed today I hope they can change a few things before the remodel is done and it gets really busy! Which the new addition and ambiance is awesome!  Just need to work on the food."}
{"text":"I am a fan of OHSO.  I have to brunch at the Indian School locations.  LOVE IT!  I was in North Scottsdale meeting up with a friend, we decided to have OHSO.  And I was craving a burger.  It is smaller than the IS location.  We were greeted and sat between inside and outside of the place.  Felt a little on display.  I order the Burger + Cheese with fries.  It was so good.  The service was average.  I had to ask for refills."}
{"text":"can't beat their brunch deal!! delicious food and brews.  super nice staff too! i always manage to find parking even when it's crazy busy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great patio that is dog friendly! Delicious drinks. The AZ burger is phenomenal probably the best burger I have ever have. You can sub turkey or veggie for beef patty"}
{"text":"First time coming here and definitely will be coming back! Great craft beer and food. It is a little bit pricey, but it's worth the price. I got the grilled cheese and my fiancé got the pork carnitas tacos. The tacos could come on a bigger plate, that would be our only compliant. Service was great. I saw two people with their dogs on the patio, so seems to be dog friendly which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Love this place. Patio is awesome, dog friendly and the food and drinks are always on point. Not as cool as the one in Arcadia, nonetheless a great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Good evening  happy hour with buds ...  Great beverage deals Need more TV's but it isn't a sports grill, so it's good."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot with easy location and parking as well as wine/drink menu. They stay open late as well and kitchen open till midnight (late night burgers..).  Staff has consistently taken care of me quickly; no waiting for tables. Plenty of room for conversations (not so loud)."}
{"text":"I love the patio here! It's in a strip mall, but doesn't even feel like it. Very cozy and welcoming for sure! The beer menu is so great too. I always ask the server what their favorite is and am never disappointed! Awesome food too! The hummus appetizer is stellar, and goes great with a hearty beer since it's kinda light :)"}
{"text":"Not super happy we walk in at 10:30 they gave us two menus late night and regular menu then had the nerve to tell us we could not order from the regular menu and had to order from the late night menu that has 3-4 items on it wtf really . Not sure if we will come back really BS"}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a drink before a movie. I got the Mule and it was way too gingery. According to the bartender, they do not use ginger beer but rather make their own in the restaurant. Regardless, the drink was awful. The bartender was really sweet and made me a new drink, which was exceptional, and didn't charge me. It was a good experience. Fixed the situation real quick."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite family brunch stop!!!!!! We are a family of three that loves football and brunch and this place is good for both.  While being trendy this place is still family friendly. We never have a bad wait usually none at all but when the weathers good there is sometimes a 5 or 10 minute wait but not bad at all!  The patios are amazing when the weather is nice and the new side patio is great and during football season even has two TVs out there. Inside is great too Tvs all in the back room. Staff is amazing as is the food. We love the breakfast bowl and brunch comes with a beer so it doesn't get better then that. Again during nice weather their patio is the place to be. Love that they are dog friendly as well."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was welcoming, food was much better than expected from a small distillery, and drinks were great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have a really great Sunday brunch deal where you get a beer or mimosas and brunch for a good price. Great selection of beer. For breakfast the lox bagel and the eggs Benedict are great. For lunch or dinner go for the Arizona burger."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and fries app which was very salty and I like salt. Main course was the green chilies bowl that sounded great but was so so. Won't be back. It is dog friendly though. Might want to pay attention to the food."}
{"text":"The menu is incredible - the servers awesome, most have been there since inception."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! Took a girl here. Server wasn't too pushy. Great price for beer. Great price for wine. Deff a place to take a date! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good came out fast! I got the pear kale salad...it was okay...too much salty-ness..needed some sweet to balance the flavor..."}
{"text":"HH ends at 6pm and we arrived at 6:02.  Our server told us it was technically after HH but said he'd be able to throw in a couple HH drinks for us if we'd like.  I got the Shandy which is a mix of citrus vodka, lemon juice, and beer.  It was delicious and refreshing on a hot afternoon!   We ordered the brisket sandwich and pork carnitas tacos.  Both dishes were tasty and the portions were generous.  I'm happy they've opened a location in Scottsdale.  I want to try their backyard BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer. Make their own distilled spirits. Great service, both at the bar, and if you are just stopping by for an evening meal. Creative entrees, done with excellence, all with an open kitchen concept. Dog friendly patio outside is huge, and dogs are welcomed with open arms. They do a Sunday brunch too which I have yet to try, but I hear good things about it."}
{"text":"Was extremely hot inside, and drinks (cocktails) and food were overpriced. We had ordered a side of Mac n cheese, which was about 1/4 box of Kraft for $5.99. Not impressed and have no clue why anyone likes this place. Go to either of the \"Peaks\" restaurants nearby instead!"}
{"text":"oh man love the team work there every one was so helpful, the food is really yummy thanks for the fantastic service and  keep up the great team work. :)"}
{"text":"Every time we're in town my husband and I eat here. Amazing beer and cocktail selection, and the food is delicious! We love the back patio with our dogs. We've had birthday parties and happy hours with friends here, and we even brewed beer here for one of our anniversaries! Try their grilled cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"After a few more trips I am updating my review. Really great and creative menu when you go for lunch or dinner. Also a really good selection of beers. Always a fun environment when you go during a sporting event as they have a few tvs to watch the game on. Staff is also always friendly, knowledgable, and helpful."}
{"text":"Despite the week-old news that Four Peaks had been bought out by Anheuser-Busch, my buddies and I decided make a trip to OHSO instead--despite Four Peaks being 20 steps away, literally. We were still brimming with hope and excitement about this place from a visit a few weeks back, and we weren't let down.  The venue has plenty of seating indoors, outdoors, and at the bar. There aren't typically many bar-goers on this side of town, but there were quite a few people here hanging out post-dinner.  The bartenders/mixologists we've had have been great- knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and straight up honest with some things (i.e., \"that whiskey tastes like straight diesel fuel, you may wanna think twice\").    They have a solid beer selection.  They seem to have mostly beers from smaller breweries around the country, so you'll be swimming in delight if you're a microbrew fan.  The benefit of this place, however, is that they're a distillery first- and they know their spirits well.  Our first visit included beer and scotch on the rocks, and this time was no different- opting for gin martinis in lieu of the scotch.  Both the martini/non-martini drinkers and the scotch/non-scotch in the group were at least satisfied, if not delighted, by how our liquor drinks have turned out thus far.  OHSO's late-night food menu is not nearly the comprehensive list as their beers.  Our group got the steak + fries and while I didn't have any, there were no complaints as to the quality of the food itself.  If you're in the area looking for a chill night, give this place a shot. For me and my bros, OHSO is definitely the front-runner for holiday reunion traditions, post-Four Peaks era."}
{"text":"We went to O.H.S.O. for the first time to celebrate our anniversary and were very happy we did. My wife and I enjoyed mules and chips and guacamole for starters which were all delicious. It was our first time trying mules and we'll definitely be having them more as our beverage of choice. I had the GF Diablo burger cooked medium and it was sooo good, loved the gluten free bun. My wife had the pork belly which she thought was phenomenal. Our waiter covered our dessert since it was our anniversary and we thought that was so sweet of him. We can't wait to go back to O.H.S.O.!!"}
{"text":"I LIKE IT!    What's not to like: Taco plates and $6.00 small craft beer pitchers!"}
{"text":"The AZ burger is good!!  The pretzel starter is good!  The grilled chicken with quinoa and asparagus is really good. I have to say I was very impressed with how well the chicken and asparagus were cooked- perfect!   Seeing a trend? Yup good food!   Ask your server about and beer or drink specials.   Nice patio - and seating indoors!   I have to give a little shout out to management for the family friendly restrooms! Not only is there a changing station but they have a little step ladder to make kiddie hand washing easier! Thanks - for making the bathroom trip a little easier on parents!"}
{"text":"The good: The outdoor seating was great! There are nice benches and a lot of umbrellas to keep the sun off of you. Today the weather was nice so I enjoyed the outdoor space. I look forward to bringing my dogs to come enjoy the outdoor space. The ingredients seemed to be good quality ingredients. The not as good: The service was pretty slow. The waitresses seemed like they didn't want to be there. The burger was pretty tasty, but it was overcooked. The fries were a bit under cooked and were served almost cold. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"For being opened only two weeks, aside from service, all was good. The wait staff will get better in time (a little slow and inattentive) but the ambience, the beer, and the food were very good!   They have brunch specials on Sat & Sun only for $10! My wife had the bratwurst and eggs. It was the best brat we ever had- not too spicy and much less gristled than others.  I had the Diablo Burger with a side salad. Cooked \"no pink\" with a great tasting sauce with chili peppers and pepper jack cheese. OHSO good!!   Many beers to choose from including local faves. OHSO stands for Old Homebrewers Social Outlet. The beer is the reason they're here!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far, but I loved my sole, but definitely not last visit. I'm really glad this location exists because the other location in Phoenix on Indian School receives a very huge crowd. I enjoy eating outside when I get a chance, so having my meal at O.H.S.O. is an idea not to be ignored. O.H.S.O. makes having a meal a social experience top on the list. I really, really like the wooden picnic tables and benches on the outside patio and all the patio umbrellas, which contribute to the welcoming, easy-going feel. It makes me feel like I'm participating in a public event and not just there for a meal. On the Sunday afternoon of my visit, I enjoyed an AZ burger, which I happily savored. O.H.S.O. has definitely made me and many a repeat customer. This will be (with no doubt) going to be one of my go-to places for either a meal or a social hour with a meal. See you soon O.H.S.O!"}
{"text":"If you are a dog lover this is the place for you. My dog sat at the table with me which is a norm around this place.The staff is so friendly and kind. They all stopped by to say hi to my dog and me and share stories. Also their brunch is great the one cent giant mimosa that you can get with your food is not a joke! Also they have home made dog treats you can give to your dog. (Did I mention how dog friendly it is?) But beyond the dog aspect the food is really very good and they are a brewery with some good beers to try. Just a great place to go and make your day happy with pets and food and drinks."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. If your a dog owner bring them with you to enjoy a fantastic burger or just a drink. They have a outstanding drink menu with a large selection of beers! When you bring your dog they provide a dish of water and a homemade dog treat! All the staff is extremely friendly. I have only had one bad experience at this location where we had asked for water for the dogs and never got it almost like it was not important to the waiter. However that was just one time and I would let that ruin one of my most favorite places to go hang out at. It feels like you very welcomed with. The staff and other people wanting to chat about your dog. I will say the best time to go is definitely in the evening no matter on a summer night the mister system and large fan makes is extremely comfortable to sit outside!!"}
{"text":"This place's awesome!   Food's great (you MUST try the steak fries! Absolutely delicious!) and my burger was O.H.S.O. yummy! I can't wait to go back. Portions were good for the price. And our waitress was kind enough to divide our bill among 8 and she even divided the cost of the steak fries we ordered on our bill so we all paid for them without having to figure out how much we each owed for it. That's something I've never seen before. Pretty cool if you ask me.  I don't drink beer so I can't speak much for it but I did try the white chocolate one and it was good (I'd have ordered one had I not been 7 months pregnant, ha!) and they had tons of other options if you don't like funky flavored beer. It's a big place, tons of sitting inside or in the patio area.   Also, they're dog friendly and one day a week you can bring your furry pal along and dine in the patio. They have doggie treats to go if you want to bring one for your doggie on the way out. I don't have a dog but I thought this was a nice touch also.  All in all, I'm not sure when I'll be back because we live far away but if and when we're back in the area, we'll make sure to go back. 5 Stars food and service. Everything was just great!!"}
{"text":"After a day in the sun, the patio was fabulous! We had the pear and goat cheese salad. Topped with walnuts and Ahi tuna, it was fabulous! The tuna was a small helping, but had a splendid spicy taste. For dessert we had the apple pie and ice cream. Nothing special, but it was good! The best - Tilted Kilt beer. It was my first taste of the smooth, dark beer. It wasn't bitter, but it was stout. I wish I could get this in Texas!   The service was above average - very friendly and attentive, but didn't hover.   I can see this becoming a regular place if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Part 3 - So since my awful encounter with my server, I decided that it was unfair to rate my whole experience a 1 when (other than the confrontation with my server Dane) everything overall was fine. I spoke with two members of management that were lovely and awesome and kind (Melissa and Wyatt) who were very apologetic about the encounter and offered every which way to make things right. That's what eating out is about, not everything is going to be perfect, but ones efforts to try and do right will always prevail. Thanks Ohso. I will be back. And no, I'm not mad at Dane everyone, he is young. I'm certain he learned from this. ------------ Part 2 - Recovering from the agressive slay I received from the server when he confronted me (in front of my colleagues during a welcome lunch) about my dry salmon. Originally gave a 4 star review (see below) but when server #53 DANE decided that he was going to let me have it for my review (he saw me yelping at the table), I changed it from 4 stars to 1 star.  Stay away from Dane. He was rude, obnoxious, confrontatious, and gets angry if you are not happy instead of trying to rectify the problem or make concessions. I let management know. I won't be returning.  ---------- Part 1 - Original review:  Decor and atmosphere great. Happy Hour with friends would be totally cool but my wedge salad (lettuce leaves were not crisp) and salmon was sooooo dry and I even specifically asked for medium.  Will give them one more try, maybe this was just a one off."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.    My fiance ordered the seafood mac 'n cheese.  I don't remember what it was called on the menu, but it had a lovely meadley of shellfish and jalepeno, seasoned perfectly with just enough spice to make your mouth water without taking away from the delicate flavor of the seafood.    I ordered the grilled cheese.  The tomato puree in it was sweet and contrasted well with the salt and flavor of the cheese; the bread was toasted nicely, and the fries were delicious, wonderfully crispy and grease-free.  We went with a large party after work, so it was very busy.  Even so, I'm taking one star away for the service.  Our waters were never refilled.  No one came along to check to see if we wanted a second beer -- potential money for the business, right?    There was also a slightly awkward situation with a bill at the end for a burger that was apparently unpaid -- I think what might have happened was that someone in our party left and forgot to pay the bill because everyone was coming in and out.  Either that or the bill was assigned to the wrong table because we couldn't figure out who had ordered that particular dish.  I understand completely that if the former were the case, someone needs to pick up the tab, but the waitress was very forward and brusque about the situation.  A few of us ended up splitting the bill, though the waitress still seemed agitated at the remainder of us, which I thought was unnecessary -- it's not like one of us was trying to walk out without paying our bill.    Still, the food was great, and I'm sure the situation mentioned above won't happen again.  I'll be back for more grub. :)"}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a near empty restaurant, been disappointed that there was a 30 minute wait,  and stayed anyway because you had hopes of a meal worth the wait?  We did and how I wish we had run instead.     During our 30 minute wait I had ample time to stroll through the nearly empty restaurant which had only perhaps 20% of the seats filled.  The hostess station mentioned that although there was plenty of seating they simply didn't have servers available.   Once seated our party of 8 was a quick turn because we frequent the Tatum/Shea location 2 or 3 times a week and know the menu well.  (Although this location's brunch menu did seem smaller.)   Our server was fine but it was very odd when our brunch came up in two separate orders and was timed separately because 'the kitchen can't accommodate orders for parties this size.'  (We were 8.)  Four of us ordered the chicken and waffles and there were four barely touched plates at the end, because something was very wrong with the chicken.  The waiter didn't notice or ask, and since two of us were already starting to feel queasy we were just glad to get the bill so we could leave.  Not a Sunday Brunch I ever want to think about again."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside even in the summer.   Cool decor inside out.   Menu is limited for vegetarians but rest of my family loves the food.  It's a bit pricey for the salads and burgers, but the food is excellent.  It's a great place for brunch all the way to dinner, and the local beer and drinks are great."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but most importantly I loved how pet friendly they are!!! Our puppy was a happy pup."}
{"text":"Did you know they have a party room?!?! The staff was super helpful and even participated in my decorating."}
{"text":"Let me please start by saying that I really love OHSO brewery and have eaten at this location, as well as all of the other locations many, many times since they've been open. I'm a huge advocate for this place and have had wonderful experiences at the PV location, as well as the Indian School location. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is amazing, and the drinks are great and fairly priced! It's one of my go-to spots; I've even hosted two work dinners at OHSO with about fifteen people each time. HOWEVER, the Hayden Rd location in Scottsdale has been disappointing and upsetting one too many times at this point. I will continue to go to OHSO, but I will never spend my money at the Scottsdale location again; nor will I ever recommend this location to anyone again. i'm not sure what the attitude with some of the bartenders is about but the last two times I visited, I got blank dumbfounded stares with zero personality from whoever was behind the bar (it was an attractive female). However, the reason I am writing this review is for one specific complaint in particular. I don't ever write poor reviews, I don't typically believe in the negativity behind it, but this is just intensely ANNOYING! Twice now, I've called ahead and asked if a specific football game was going to be. The person on the phone would ask her coworkers while on the phone with me, and everyone would say yes we will be playing that game. I would say perfect, I'll head over! I would get to the restaurant, wearing the jersey of the team I called about and the servers all stare at me oddly, proceed to take a drink order from me and let me sit there until I ask, \"can you please but this specific game on so that I don't miss kick-off. To which the server replied, \"oh sorry, we know you called but we realized after we're not playing that game. So they all knew thats why I was there and said nothing and just proceeded to take my order. They were so rude and unapologetic, they were almost laughing at me when I looked noticeable upset/irritated, because I could have easily had enough time to make it to another place by kick-off if someone would have done the right thing and let me know about their mistake. As I walked away the server was smiling as if it was funny and the managers said goodbye in a bubbly voice, as if I was leaving a pleased customer. This has happened TWICE now. Once last season and once this season. It's disgraceful and AWFUL service. thumbs all the way down for the service at the Scottsdale OHSO. I hope management or someone who can save them, sees this!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I love the Mac Del Mar....My significant other has a mild seafood allergy and still orders it, it's THAT good. The mixed drinks are very good here and they have a really great selection of beer here! They even had Big Blue Van Blueberry Hefeweizen, which we haven't had since we left Flagstaff. It was a wonderful evening and my girlfriend was very pleased with being here for her birthday. All of the adorable dogs that were present were a plus as well!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here because I had heard wonderful things about this place and had never gone myself. My family was in Arizona visiting and had their dogs with them. We called ahead of time to make sure it was dog friendly, whoever answered the phone was very rude. Once we got there, they said there was a 20 minute wait. 40 minutes went by and they called our name & it was for a table where dogs weren't allowed. The hostess said she didn't know we had the dogs with us even though they had been in our arms or on the leash the whole time even when we put our names in, and we specifically asked for an area where our dogs could be. My mom and I left with the dogs so the rest of the part could go in and eat at the table they had for us since now everyone was in a hurry because the table took 40 minutes instead of 20. From what they told us, their food came out cold & the overall experience was not good. The manager was very nice and went out of his way to make it right. Ended up giving my family a gift card for me to come back but I don't think I will use it. I'm not sure if I'd give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I went for the first time for lunch while I waited for a motorcycle repair at Go AZ. Great burgers with a nice beer menu and a really pleasant atmosphere. I plan to take the dog back for the dog friendly patio soon :D"}
{"text":"Good place to drink and hang out with friends. They have good selection of Arizona craft beers but I don't feel nothing special compare to other similar pubs here."}
{"text":"Love this Resturant!! We can bring our pups with us and enjoy drinks and delicious food in the outdoor booths. While our pups get homemade dog biscuits and a fresh bowl of water now that's service! Great $10 Brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Just a wonderful  place for everyone"}
{"text":"We need an OHSO in Tucson! This place has a great vibe and the food is incredible.  We went there for brunch and were able to bring our dog and hang out on the patio. Great selection of breakfast and lunch items to have for brunch and we haven't had anything we didn't love."}
{"text":"Best guacamole (and biscuit and gravy) I know of!  Bloody Mary's are a complete win.  Dog friendly patio and treats for the pup.  Beer selection is great-they have an orange beer that can easily compete with Papago orange blossom."}
{"text":"Oooh I love the brunch! Fun place to go with friends. Games in the back. Great staff good food. Love the hostesses! So sweet and helpful! Annnd the beer is pretty good too."}
{"text":"A fantastic bloody Mary, made with their horseradish vodka. Perfect considering I am a total snob on them. Had really nice hummus too. Excellent microbrew and distillery."}
{"text":"We love coming here on Friday nights after a long week. The staff is always attentive and the food hits the spot!  The salmon is one of my most favorite dishes.  Enjoy taking our schnauzer and seeing all the furbabies enjoying a night out with the family"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops for great burgers and ppl watching. Close to my house and right off of the 101.   They have also scored major points (I mean, major) with me being that they have dog-friendly patios. Not only that, but they *encourage* you to bring your pawed and furry loves.   During oppressive Phoenix summers, their patio has a large (industrial-sized) fan blowing as well as misters. Plus the bright orange umbrellas in full bloom for maximum shade.  I always get their Cheeseburger and can't seem to break out of that comfort zone choice. If you like your burger rare, tell them you want it \"pink\". Served on a homemade roll and with bacon. It's just a food party going on - excellent seasoning on the patty and grilled to perfection.  Burgers are served with fries (shoestring). Yes, I do like them but they're not my absolute faves. I prefer the larger/meaty tates. :)  Service is always chipper and accommodating."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Derek, was great.   My husband loved his bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I ordered the grilled cheese and was a little disappointed for $12.  I guess my real issue wasn't the $12, it was that there was a LOT of pancetta chunks on it(maybe why so expensive).   All I could taste was salt.  I couldn't taste the tomato mix at all.  I picked most of the pancetta off and it still just tasted like salt.  The place is fun and hip and quirky but watch the cheese sandwich.  P.S. I love salt.  I salt everything.  But this was a salt lick."}
{"text":"What could be better than an local brewery expanding to a location closer to my home (btw, the center of the universe)? How about a nano brewery with an excellent selection of guest taps that is also a distillery.  Wait. Go back. Read that again.  This one is also a distillery!  Do you want a patio experience with your hipster friends? Check! (Admit it, your friends are pretty much hipsters).  Do you want a cool interior with a giant tricycle over a bar. Not a \"large tricycle\" but a genuinely GIANT tricycle over a bar with 8 big screen televisions just over your left shoulder? Check!  Do you want a back room and hidden bar illuminated not by bicycle headlights but, rather, but bicycle headlights mounted to matching bicycles and hanging from the ceiling? Check! (Seriously this would be an ultra cool place for a catered work gathering. If you use this space for your work gathering please hire me. I will work for free).  Do you want a brunch with an excuse to drink beer in the morning with excellent waffles and chicken or a bowl (yes, a bowl) of steak, potatoes and eggs? Check!  Why are you still reading this? You need to check this place out. Now."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good pub, brew, appetizers, drinks and a place to watch a great ballgame, go to O.H.S.O..  Being from Portland, we are a bit snobby with pubs, but love this place."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with this review by saying sorry that I have to go against popular demand but this is what yelp is all about.  We went and checked in there just after 10 o'clock to get something to eat. We are driving by and saw four peaks and a few other's and we're looking on yelp for places that were open to eat late and figured this is a eatery and distillery so that means to me it's a bar with food so we decided to go in. The first problem that I have is as you're walking in it smells like sewer and I don't know why it's there but if I was an owner I would definitely be doing something about it. The next issue was that as soon as I walk in it's a dog patio and I know there's a lot of dogs here and they want to be accommodating to people with their dogs however I am just not one to mix animals and food. We then sit down and I'm  given menus and are told that this is the late-night our menu and there had been no more than six items of which three weren't even real dishes it's basically pretzels hummus and burgers so for a bar that doesn't leave very much food at all to order. The only place that I see late menus is places like Pita jungle and even then they have a much bigger menu then this bar for a late night menu. So in conclusion not my place, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Legitimately good food, and a great atmosphere. Come for bbq Sundays and try not to get grey out on good craft beer. Haha"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor seating here - it was chilly but we are from Chgo so we sat outside, turned off our heatlamp and it was perfect.  DOG FRIENDLY outdoor patio and so many people bring their pups.  It was so cute, laid back, awesome wait staff, good food.  Stand out for me were the \"pork wings\" -- crispy, salty, little ribs of love.  Decent Bloody Mary, too."}
{"text":"Worst Brisket I've ever had. Not sure what there going for? More accurate description would be prepackaged reheated shredded bbq beef."}
{"text":"While I would say I'd revisit some mid numerals  1 you want a sample you have to pay 2 no mention by the wait person about their in house beers 3 no real check back by anyone not even a mgr must have been by us at least 14 times and I believe even took my plate away not even asking how was everything ( if you don't ask all is good I guess) 4 ordered pink meat while middle showed pink the burger was dry! It was pressed 5 yes would try them again but with reservations  6 it's the little things that I believe they missed that really made this a \"SoSo\" visit vs an \"OHSO\" visit! 7 really wasn't that busy!  NOT BAD NOT GREAT \"SOSO\""}
{"text":"Great casual brunch spot. The food was delicious and the mimosas are strong. What more could you need."}
{"text":"This place gets busy, but so does their other location. What really makes me sad about this place is....they don't have the beers from the brewery...SOOOO SOOOO sad. The food seems a little better up here. My wife prefers this location and I prefer the brewery.  Always love the decorations at OHSO, can't go wrong with bicycles."}
{"text":"O.H.S.O always has a great relaxing ambiance.  It is pet friendly so you will most likely see a dog or two out in the patio. There is of course a huge variety of beers and great food so you will always find something you like.  This time I tried the Ensalada del Sol which was an exquisite salad with a cilantro dressing which mixes perfectly with the other ingredients in the salad including salsa and avocado.  The salad is pretty big and can easily feed two people."}
{"text":"It was my birthday weekend and I desperately wanted breakfast on a patio and to try a new place. Lucky for me, OHSO recently opened up, they serve brunch on the weekends, and they have a patio. My husband was eager to please and we drove to OHSO.  When we arrived, the patio was full. So we chose a bar table near the front entrance, so we could see outside. Our waiter was friendly and quick to take our orders. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. My husband ordered the carnitas bowl - green chile carnitas, scrambled egg, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo. Every brunch entrée is $10 and includes a beer or mimosa. We aren't beer drinkers, so we ordered the mimosas (sans the champagne, so really it was just orange juice). The orange juice was delicious and went well with our entrees. My biscuits and gravy were phenomenal - one of the best I've had. Four biscuits slathered in beer gravy with large pieces of sausage. Then two pieces of thick cut bacon and scrambled eggs. Yum! My husband really enjoyed his meal, but mine really took the cake.   Since then, we've been back and I even brought my dad. Once again, we all ordered the biscuits and gravy. The B&Gs are that good. I would highly recommend this place for brunch. It's a great deal and the food is delicious. I can't wait to come back and try some more of their items."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go hang out with friends and have a few drinks! I haven't had the food but it's a great atmosphere and fun place to go!"}
{"text":"O.H.S.O is one of my favorite spots to hit up on a nice sunny Arizona day... First they encourage you to bring your fur babies... They supply water bowls and treats for them and the staff always showers them with attention!  They have a killer beer selection, a great cocktail list and the food is amazing! But seriously, you can't beat their solid brunch menu on the weekends that includes a beer or a mimosa. They have some winners on their regular menu as well, I am a fan of their Green Chile Pork Skillet and their Salmon BLT for entrees and you can't beat their Pork Wings, Pretzel Board or Ahi and Calamari for starters.   So, if your looking for a great spot to hang for a bit, watch whatever sport is on at the moment  and bring your fur children O.H.S.O is your spot!"}
{"text":"Love the environment and love the beer brunch special! Service was suuperrrr slow even though there were at least tons of people working in the front of the house.  Waitress was very polite and energetic though. Fruity pebble French toast was huge! Super sweet though. Doughnut holes were great though! Love that they allow dogs."}
{"text":"my cousin recommended this place so I met him here along with a friend.  I got the AZ burger and it was one of the best burgers ive ate. I love cream cheese and that's what did it for me. cool atmosphere and good service. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Trystan is an amazing bartender.  I highly recommend the mimosa.  I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of nights ago and wasn't a fan of our server out on the patio.  He seemed annoyed, not willing to do his job and was very unpleasant.  Not only that , he had forgotten to ring in my appetizer and 20 min later I had finally asked two people about it and was taken care of right away.  He obviously got cut and decided to not let us know that someone else was taking over."}
{"text":"I am a huge supporter of OHSO, primarily the PV location.  Met some family at the North Scottsdale location; our server did a good job. The food was inedible is some cases,; the chicken in the chicken and waffles tasted very 'off' and two of our guests felt sick shortly after breakfast.  Won't ever be back to this location."}
{"text":"I do love OHSO. I do love the original OHSO more, mostly because it's closer to me, has much better views of Camelback rather than a strip mall, and isn't going through growing pains like this one.    I don't normally go up this far North, but for a friend's bday we had a large party that came here. Situated in a strip mall (it's N Scottsdale, is there anything else?) this location's patio is much bigger than the original, but the views suck.  My main beef with this location was the unbelievable wait.  We got there at 6:30 pm, and yes we had a large party.  But at 9 PM, I left.  I left without eating.    It's new and all the N Scottsdale peole are flocking there obviously, but the 2 1/2 hour wait was insane.    I'll stick with my location."}
{"text":"I was going to give three stars but the longer we sat at our table the more I hated the experience of eating here. I love the atmosphere of this place and they are very dog friendly, but those are the only positives. We originally came in because the sign outside said brunch and mimosas/beer were $10. We thought this applied to every brunch item but this was our mistake for not asking before ordering. I ordered a mimosa which was basically just watered down champagne. People who had been seated after us had already gotten their food while we were still waiting. The waitress said that they had remade my sandwich because it had been sitting for so long but when I finally got it, it was obvious it was the same sandwich as the bread was soggy. I was honestly really disappointed with the quality of food because it's such a cool place but the food and service are really lacking. I could have made a better meal at home for free. There was also some kind of disconnect between servers as multiple people came up and asked if we needed boxes but we didn't get one for about 10 minutes. When we finally got a box it took a while longer to get the check which was strange because usually they bring those two together. I'm sure their brews and distillery are good but I will not be coming back here to eat."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my faves.....today at lunch, ordered special salad, did not come out as ordered, waitress offered no help.  Brought co-worker in for her Birthday....OHSO did nothing...not a free shot, etc.  Rum and Cokes were tiny.  Total tab for a couple of drinks, two salads not made as ordered and a burger  - $143.....  AND, hostesses are testy about giving you the table you like.....attitude problem with most of hostesses.  Not a good value anymore...."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Cuban sandwich, AZ Burger, fries, turkey burger, multiple types of beers all were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place. Incredibly dog friendly as long as you are willing to sit outside on the patio. Food is great, from burgers and bbq to salads.....great beer, brewed themselves, in addition to plenty of great beers from other breweries."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch menu! $10 for a meal plus a beer or mimosa is a great deal. The breakfast potatoes are amazing! Even tried a breakfast flat bread the other day which was recommended and it is my favorite item so far. Great atmosphere and I love that I can bring my dog to brunch with me."}
{"text":"Heard that it was a great place from Co workers. I work and live FAR away in Peoria.  We were extremely surprised at what Ohso offered. Amazing food (holy Bacon!) and Mimosas for Sunday Brunch.  Service was perfect. They even dropped off a To Go iced tea for me.    ...I didnt ask for it, but it was greatly appreciated.  I think we are gonna go back for dinner right now. Im gonna hit that long list of Whiskeys.  Why not!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great brunch specials for sure, can't beat getting a beer or mimosas with your food for $10! The dog friendly patio is always a plus, but what I love most is the atmosphere and the staff here! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Four out of four people at our table had mistakes made with their food. Some were easy to amend (picking off onions, etc), some were not (burger slathered in undesirable sauce). Remedy took a while and everyone else was finished or nearly so by the time I got my corrected burger. One more umbrella on the outside patio would not go amiss either. Small selection on the menu. I'll give it another shot once they are more established, but not impressed thus far."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great brunch and atmosphere. The brunch deal is an entree and a mimosa or beer for only $10! Next time I go, I'm bringing my dog because it's very dog friendly! They had treats so I brought one home to my pup :)"}
{"text":"Best brunch in North Scottsdale, bar none. We love the huge dog friendly patio and have never been disappointed in the food. They have a great beer list of local beers and now they're even making their own craft brews and distilling their own vodka. Fun times, one of our favorite spots on the weekend."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. The atmosphere is Not as nice as the Indian school location, but it's still great. Service was fast and spot on. Order the brisket Mac and cheese and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Love this place! Thanks to my son Kayvon for recommending this place to us.  We went for our Easter brunch. Had a great time. Their beers are delicious. Food is great. Best of all we can bring our dog too."}
{"text":"OHSO is a good brewery. It's the first place I tried a coffee infused beer and even though I've tried many since. OHSO still does it well.  They also have a solid food selection. The vibe here is also cool and chill. There are some other breweries in this plaza but don't waste your time lol. Just come here."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard that O.H.S.O. Was opening a sport in north Scottsdale. Very cool because I enjoyed the Arcadia one so much.  What's not to like?  One of the most dog friendly patios in the valley, craft beer and good food.   It's good to know that the scottsdale location is more of the same. Real good vibe, just only difference is the amazing view is lacking of Camelback Mt.lol.  We came here during a food ball game and it was a good time. Lucky we came in a Sunday and they had their backyard bbq going on. Seriously a great deal! All you can eat BBQ! The meat was great! Pair it with a craft beer and it's even better. My table also shared the steak and fries which were great!  Came here another time for late night happy hour and shared a $6 pitcher of local beer. Another great deal!  I'm told that this location will not be brewing their own beer, rather they will have a distillery. Will be interesting when it's up and running.   On way out of restaurant I had to grab a few dog biscuits. We have 3 dogs and they all over the treats I bring them.  That really one bonus of O.H.S.O, I love how dog friendly they are. I didn't see a dog wash at this location like the Arcadia location, but maybe I missed it??  Also saw O.H.S.O is opening a PV location. Too bad no west side locations on the list, the west side could really use a place like O.H.S.O!"}
{"text":"Oh OHSO...how do I love thee! You are near my house and now near my work and I am now certainly going to be fat from your bloody mary's and brisket and french fries.   I am biased because the original OHSO has such a fantastic location and patio, but this is in an awesome center with an OK patio - in fact its kind of cool how they utilized the space. They kept with the bike theme and added some neat touches to accommodate the new place. The open kitchen is a fun touch - its so busy but they keep it clean and I love to see whats happening in there.   The menu is similar but there are a bunch of different things on there which make me jealous that we don't have them at the other location. I stuck with my old favorite, the brisket, but my girlfriend got the waldorf wrap which was nice and refreshing. The guys got the brisket as well. Their bloody's are fantastic at both locations but this one offers a peppered bacon as the stirrer and man was that amazing! It melts in your mouth and I don't think I have ever drank one as fast as I did today.  Jon, the owner, was there chatting it up with everyone. He is such a great guy. I was impressed to see how busy the new location was since it was the first day today. This location is going to kill it and give Four Peaks a run for their money. Cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We come here every year for delicious food and a huge beer selection! Extremely dog friendly with lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The weekend brunch is $10 for breakfast with a beer or mimosa. The staff is super friendly and the service is great!"}
{"text":"If you love O.H.S.O. as much as I do,  specifically the Arcadia location please keep an open mind.  The food was great as always as well as the beer.  It was easy to find parking and the patio is dog friendly.    However,  don't expect to feel welcomed at this location.  I felt as though we were bothering the staff especially when I asked our server what beer he recommends which made me nervous to even ask about the mac n chhese. A totally different vibe from  the other location where everybody knows your name. If you can look past awkward,  unfriendly  service then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The food is the right proportion if anything the plates are great to share second time here and the staff is amazing , my son just wants to talk to everybody and distract them  definitely our favorite mom and son Saturday day date"}
{"text":"To be honest, I bought some of their rum at the Gilbert Farmers Market. I'd eaten at the first one in Phoenix when they first opened and I liked it. I'm thrilled they have one coming in Gilbert. So on the recommendation of the guys selling the Rum in Gilbert, I had to try the newer menu that they have. Since I was dashing around town, I kept it quick and tasty and had the Biscuits and Beer Gravy. It was just as good as I'd imagined it would be. Creamy with lots of flavor. I'd love the gravy on a chicken fried chicken breast or steak. As I said. I can't wait till they open in Gilbert.  If you can score a bottle of rum from the whiskey barrel, I highly suggest you grab it. It's the best of the Rum and Whiskey worlds together."}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere! Their beer selection and food pairing are phenomenal. They are really inventive when it comes to their food items!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor seating but sometimes can be a letdown at the North Scottsdale location. The service is typically really great and the staff is super super nice, but if you get seated in the outdoor patio on the side, just make sure you are vocal in getting your waiter back. From my experience, they sometimes forget about you over there. The atmosphere and the dog scene helps make up for it, though! That's the only really unique thing that keeps me going back is that its dog friendly!  It's also pretty overpriced for the quality of the food. They either need to up their game on what they deliver, or bring prices down because my final bill just keeps bugging me every time I go. The beer and wine is on point though, and you can get mini pitchers (fun!) so we've actually been steering clear of the overpriced dinner plates and just grabbing beers and sharing some apps. They have 36 beers on tap and 24 wines (btg) and happy hour during the week M-F 11am-6pm, so recco going during that time due to the higher prices ;)  Here's what I recommend for food: Garlic pesto hummus to start and split a main dish like the The brisket sandwich. The menu is actually pretty limited, so we sometimes add on some sweet potato fries if we're having a major snack attack. I also just recently went for lunch, and we split the caramel apple pie (mainly because everyone and their mom was ordering it, and we felt like Pavlov's dog) and it was CLUTCH! I don't even have a sweet tooth, and this was fantaaaastic! This sweet dish also makes up for the other shortcomings :)  This place is always poppin, just wish they had better menu options!   For easy reference, hours are: Monday-Thursday: 11am-midnight  Friday: 11am-1:30am Saturday: 9am-1:30am Sunday: 9am-midnight"}
{"text":"It's really a hit or miss. I personally like the service and staff better at the PV location(and it's way more packed which is better ). We went there in a group for brunch. I had their classic brunch and it was good, although I wasn't happy they charge for avocado instead of switching it out for bacon. And it was like two slices they brought me. Also their fruity pebble French toast is amazing. It's very heavy tho. Good place for brunch. And their carne asada fries were good minus the meat. I get the side portion because their normal size feeds like 5 people"}
{"text":"Amazing Saturday brunch. Chicken and waffles, work maple syrup infused with Red Hot, outstanding.  Dog friendly patio adds to the charm.   Great wait staff."}
{"text":"If I could give Jeremy the whiskey tender 10 stars I would! What a pleasant experience. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I enjoy a lot about this local brewery & eatery., however they substantially raised the prices on their food items. $13 - $15 for a burger is not favorable."}
{"text":"We love this place!  There aren't a many good places in the area that have great food, excellent service and patio seating.  The brunch is awesome and the mimosas are huge!   Only suggestion is please bring back the steak breakfast burrito:)"}
{"text":"This place is whatever honestly. Bar food and a ton of beer. But hey if you like that then it's your place. Now we know. The manager was nice and fixed a few things. Overall it was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst brunch ever.   There are 4 of us that try different brunches and I recommended this restaurant and so sorry I did.   The eggs and potatoes appear to be pre cooked.  Potatoes were cold and hard like they had been setting for several hours.  Bacon was not cooked very well and super greasy.  Quiche was best of the 4 and it was mediocre at best.  Carnitas bowl very bland.    First and very last visit for sure!!"}
{"text":"New favorite. Sat and Sun brunch served with a free beer or mimosa. Tried the chicken and waffles per the bartenders recommendation, and it hit the spot for sure! Not what to order if you're dieting, but it's the perfectly cooked sweet waffle with a hot sauce syrup and battered chicken strips, served with a side of bacon. Already looking forward to my next meal here. Neighbors had the wings, and they looked to die for!! Also heard their burgers are some of the best you'll have."}
{"text":"The Backyard BBQ on Sunday afternoons is really filling and flavorful. It starts at 3pm and if you're still hungry after your first plate you can ask your server for a second helping.   Red Sangria is strong and fruitful while the White Sangria is sweet.   Veggie burger and sweet potato fries are a must."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has such a cool vibe! However, the menu is very small, and very pricey especially for breakfast food, $12 for some basic eggs and bacon"}
{"text":"My dad was very pleased with his Father's Day visit here and we all left a little tipsy and fully satisfied. The beers they have on tap are amazing, probably some of the best beers I've had. The place is huge and the vibe is very laid back and welcoming. I could definitely see myself hanging out here after work with some friends trying out different beers. I like how you get a beer or mimosa with brunch. I didn't like the mimosa but I'm not really a champagne person so I'm glad I stuck with my beer. I'm always looking for some good brown ales and wow they have a couple nice ones on their menu. I guess the only note I would make was the Monte Cristo wasn't really a Monte Cristo. It wasn't fried and there was no powdered sugar...kind of odd? It just needs a little tweaking and it'll be great."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and am glad to see they opened up a spot near my office. We went after work one evening and were seated at a table inside near the entrance. The service was great for our group of 6 and the drinks and food were great! Do note that the menu on the website is for their main location and don't get your hopes up for the green chili pork sandwich :(  I ended up ordering the Arizona burger after we shared a couple of appetizers. I also indulged in a sangria and then switched to their white IPA which, for someone who doesn't like beer, was pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying them out again before I leave town."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our all-time favs! Healthy (organic) and happy (libations) place. Brunch is $10 for a good size mimosa and bfast item. Can't beat that! Comfy, cool, good food at a great price and fantastic ppl watching. See you next week!"}
{"text":"Great for Sunday brunch. It's fun to see all of the doggies and they give you free treats and water for your pups. Food is really good. I tend to be partial to their breakfast. Their mimosas are dangerously good"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! I had the AZ burger with a gf bun and gf sweet potato fries. The burger came out juicy and perfectly seasoned. Our server was very sweet and nice to our dog. (Oh-their patio is very dog friendly) They gave our pup a treat when we arrived. The whole experience was great. I will definitely be back to try their brunch specials on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Pricey!   VERY small happy hour food portions.  Stupid big fake bike in middle of bar wrecks view of 3 of the 5 TVs. Not good.  Nice patio. But no TVs.  Could do SO much better!"}
{"text":"I've been to their original location a few times and was excited to find out there was one opening up close to me! We went for brunch and it was fantastic. For $10 you get a large meal and one of their local beers or a huge mimosa. You seriously can't beat that deal!  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was delicious. I also had a bite or two of the Pan Purdue which is their french toast. It wasn't overly sweet or heavy. They forgot the fruit compote at first but brought some out when we inquired about it. Be sure they give it to you, it's great!  They do have a patio outside which is dog friendly. However, it's not as large as the Phoenix location.   I hope more restaurants open a location in N. Scottsdale as it's so much more convenient than driving to Phoenix every time I want a great meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a place you can have a craft brew, sit on a huge outdoor patio and bring your pooch to? This is your place. I like to come on the weekends for brunch and we bring our dog. All breakfast entrees are only $10 with a local beer or mimosa (great deal).  The burgers are great and I will be returning to try out the BBQ they do on Sundays."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday with my beautiful daughter and our babies (dogs). Great atmosphere.  Loved the spicy biscuits and gravy. Going back tomorrow with my miniature poodle, Bella. Yum."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for \"Mom's night out\" and definitely took advantage of their delicious cocktails! I had the Shandy, which was so refreshing. We split the hummus plate, which was a bit small for what you get. Same thing with the kale salad. The bar and booths were squished so tight together, it was hard to maneuver around. I really enjoyed it because my friend and I stayed for 3 hours on a Saturday night and even though we each only ordered 2 drinks, an app and small entree at the end, the waiter was super cool and nice."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The outdoor seating is perfect for my family and dogs are allowed. So much fun!!"}
{"text":"First time here! Had to find a pet friendly place for brunch. Saw they had $10 brunch! So, decided to give a try. I arrived first. Excited for water w cucumber here. Love me some cucumber water and server asked if I wanted my mimosa or beer included w my brunch while I waited for my friend. Yes, please. It was in a wine glass. Perfect. Dog friendly patio, They bake dog biscuits too. Everyone eating there was super nice too! Had quiche and potatoes and pal had biscuits & gravy, eggs and bacon. My card was accidentally charged twice but server gave me heads up. Which I totally appreciated. Said it would be back on card. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Very cool place with a comfortable atmosphere! Perfect place to grab late night drinks with friends or to go on a fun and relaxed date. Lots of home brews to choose from. You can also brew beer at their primary location!"}
{"text":"Pleasant place. Decent food. Ok ambience. I love that you can bring you dogs. Never a bad experience here, but never anything that sticks out too much either. Kind of a crappy location which is unfortunate. An ok place to grab a beer and watch the game."}
{"text":"I've been to this ohso a number of times in the last year or so. It can be such a hit or miss and the lack of consistency really bothers me. I usually go for brunch solely because of the great deal on a mimosa. The food though....not great. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just that there are many other, better brunch food options in Scottsdale. I usually get the carnitas bowl and although it is somewhat good, I feel the quality of the ingredients is pretty low. I do like the atmosphere. Even though the outside overlooks a parking lot, the bright orange detracts the eye and it is so bright and cheery. Also, I love that you can bring dogs (although I don't have my own, I enjoy seeing everyone else's). The thing that gets me is the service. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's horrible. One time we were seated in the bar and no one ever came over. I went back up to the host and she came over and took our order. I had a question about a beer, but she didn't know, nor do I fault her because she said she was only 17. A server brought the beer and food over but never indicated to us that she was our server. She also brought the check. The only person who ever checked on us was the hostess. I gave the hostess a cash tip for her help. No one else was friendly or even seemed to notice us. This has happened twice when sitting inside in the afternoon. On the flip side, when I come for brunch and sit outside, the service is usually wonderful. It's so bizarre."}
{"text":"I'm very glad this place opened up near my home.  I've gone here for brunch, lunch and dinner.  Each visit has been very pleasant with the staff and the food.     Brunch: I ordered the french toast and it wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was still tasty.  Lunch:  Hands down the Arizona Burger!  It never disappoints!  yom yom yom yom   Dinner: Arizona Burger once again! lol  The beers are also damn good.  The White Chocolate Ale is a fan favorite, but it's hard to pick a favorite when they have such a great selection.    Happy hour is always busy!  So get there early to avoid a long wait for a table.  Everyone likes to hang out in the patio and at the bar."}
{"text":"i ate here the other day. it was nice. i liked it. i like dogs too. there are a lot of them here and they have good food. you should go."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! We absolutely love this place. It's always crowded and they pack tables and the bar very closely together. That part sucks as everyone has to squeeze to get by every where you go. For that reason I wouldn't sit at the bar.  Compactness aside, their Sunday $10 brunch is what we always come here for. The food and a beer are included in that price? WHAT!  I've had several things on their menu, all delicious, and with a practically free beer, I can see why this place is always full. We go here at least once a month and wish we could go more often. Highly recommend if you like brunch and beer... or a mimosa which is also available in their $10 brunch deal."}
{"text":"Love this place, wow, as well, for sure going back,  nice vibes and chill, plus, you can bring your dog's and have much of a get time as a dog lover :),  yes their are place to eat where their is no dogs, lol, it's the best if you like to live a life that is fun and love to experience new things;  for this place is something that is right on top of being a new place, for you can go their different times and find something new about it each and every time,  lol, great food and wine too, plus,  many different kinda of drinks that they make their. Food is good, may they even have a place in the back that has its own vib to it...yes a must see and do again kinda place"}
{"text":"Dirty inside, the window sills had food in them and the floors under the tables by the windows were dirty. The only place to have a high chair was inside so we couldn't enjoy the cute patio, that was a bit of a bummer and brunch options very limited for non meat eaters, but I would go back for drinks and appetizers without the kids to enjoy outside."}
{"text":"The food menu is limited but if you're gonna order something, order the Ahi Tuna  & Calamari appetizer. The tuna is spicy the way you like it and the calamari isn't the normal mundane red sauce, it's a spicy concoction of their own. The service is slightly better than average but always friendly and willing to accommodate. They have a Saturday & Sunday brunch in which they include only ONE 10 oz beer from their list of homemade brews or ONE Mimosa, a little chincy. The food and drink value is average overall but I really like this place. Outdoors they have great misters to keep you cool and they allow dogs on the outside patio. Also FREE valet parking, that brings this up to an overall 4 start rating."}
{"text":"We are from Tucson and discovered this place during Memorial weekend, I WAS OBSESSED. We sat on the patio, where I felt so relaxed....just an overall awesome atmosphere. The music was great, ambiance was nice, barely anyone there (we went around 9pm). We got the Pretzel Board appetizer, which was delicious but if I had to change one thing, I wish the cheese was served a little bit hotter. I order the Asian Chop Salad and my hubby got the AZ Burger. Both DELICIOUS. Perfect amount of food. We returned for lunch a few days later, it was a lithe more busy but still awesome. They had the misters on in the patio, umbrellas up so it felt amazing being outside without being burnt to death. I had the same salad, my hubby got the Ensalada del Sol (AMAZING) and we shared the OHSO Green Chili Queso Dip which was also very very good. We have 3 dogs back at home and I want more than anything to bring them up here with us, esp since they are very dog friendly and have fresh dog biscuits for free. Hubby and I returned tonight, went around 9pm again...wasn't very busy but we got an idiot waiter (unsure of his name) but we ordered our food, he didn't write it down, walked off and came back about 5 min later asking us to remind him what we ordered. We told him again....So we wait and wait for our appetizer and it never comes....but we get our dinner salads. The lady who delivered it asked if we wanted to wait to eat our salads after the appetizer and have the kitchen remake it and we said yes. So, we waited another 10 min for our appetizer to come out. We thought it looked different from when we ordered it two weeks ago....i think it was the same thing...hmmm. We finish, wait another 10 min and get our salads...mine had no dressing and was missing the oranges so I had to ask for it. Just an annoying experience full of unnecessary things that should not happen at a restaurant. Makes me sad bc i LOVE this place and i hated having such a bad experience. I'm sure I will return but stay far far away from that idiot waiter."}
{"text":"I am so glad they opened this location so I don't have to drive so far away now.   Its a hip little place with a laid back vibe. The staff is polite, although not always attentive. I sometimes feel as if the entire staff is a bunch of college kids that need a little extra direction, but have been pretty pleased with my experiences there.   I have tried the cheese board and can't complain about it. The meats and cheeses were delish! I especially enjoyed brie stuffed croissant, mmmm! The blue crab dip was pretty good, nothing to write home about. I LOVE the Az Burger, it's become one of my favorite burger's in town! I wish you could actually choose the temperature of your burger, you only have an option of\" pink or not pink\", which I find absolutely ridiculous at what seems like a brewery and burger place.  I think they have a great selection of specialty beers and cocktails. No matter what I am in the mood for there is something yummy available to try.    I have not been let down by their food or drinks and would recommend."}
{"text":"OHSO is certainly a cut above the rest. They not only have a wide selection of craft beers including their own and other Arizona craft beers, but also have a wide selection of unique cocktails. The bar staff is friendly, knowledgeable an efficient - a real pleasure to talk to an the appetizers are a meal in-and-off themselves. I highly recommend their cheese board and Ahi Tuna appetizer."}
{"text":"I always use Yelp before going anywhere to eat or drink. I noticed this place had great reviews and now that I've visited I don't think I'll ever come back.   My friend ordered a Kettle One and soda and the waitress proceeded to say, \"We only have our alcohol that we serve! I mean we have Kettle One but I'm supposed to push our drinks!\" So if you have never been here O.S.H.O makes its vodka and gin. Now I'm not saying she shouldn't push the restaurants alcohol, I was honestly very intrigued at the idea. But the way she went about it was very wrong.   The food was honestly really great loved every minute of that part, that's the only reason why I didn't give one star!  My last rant is going to be the bad service, how are yo going to honestly feel okay serving customers soap stained glasses. Now if it was a well drink yeah who cares, but I ordered a $30 dollar glass of bourbon and it was served in the dirtiest glass I have ever seen!   Thanks for the food, hopefully you can clean up the rest!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that you can bring your dog and they treat them like kings! Food is good, service is excellent and seeing all of the dogs sitting there and enjoying each other and the environment is THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Fun patio, must be a dog lover (which I am) for the patio is overrun with four legged friends. Super friendly service, clientele leaves a bit to be desired. Fun place to bike to on the levee. Good guacamole, brisket and burgers are good but nothing really stood out as special on the menu. I'd come here again  for drinks but not a meal."}
{"text":"I've been to OHSO eatery a number of times so I'm not writing this review on one visit but on my general feeling.  I love the array of beer they have on tap - I always find something really good and then can't remember what it was.  The next time I have to start all over with finding my favorite. I have a feeling the quantity of beer consumed directly effects my ability to remember.  Here are the things I've tried: Veggie Burger - delicious, love this one.  Not even a vegetarian but enjoy the heck out of it.  Gnocchi - YES!  Love it.  Heaven.  Beet Salad - good, but they forgot to add the goat cheese on this one so it did not achieve full deliciousness.  OHSO Rita Flatbread - not spectacular.  If you're going full bore on the carbs go for the gnocchi.  Spicy Green Chile Pulled Pork - very delicious and SPICY.  Get ready for a kick.  Biscuits and Beer Gravy - not my favorite.  Needed more gravy and the biscuits were pretty dry.    I love the atmosphere of this place and bring your pups out to the back patio.  Great place to hang out and try a few beers (1, 2...10)."}
{"text":"Wow that was incredible. I was craving greens so I ended up getting a veggie burger. It came with mixed greens, guacamole, and a special o.h.s.o sauce. The bun was soft and fluffy and pair d with the sauce, the veggie burger itself, the guacamole and mixed green, it was just delightful. I got a side salad with a berry vinaigrette. The tomato in the salad was exotic and the dressing was tangy and delicious, I am inspired to create my own for my next dinner party! Our waitress was so sweet, I love short and sweet conversation and when I asked how long they had been open, since it was our first time trying the place, she was very sweet, articulate, and informative! I am looking forward to our return as they have a Sunday brunch- my fav!"}
{"text":"First time I've been to this location pretty consistent with their other restaurant on Tatum and Shea. The food was good here and the service was good, not great but acceptable. I think I like the other location more, just a different feel than this one. I would still recommend eating here just not my location of choice."}
{"text":"Ahhhh this this the second time we tried to visit OHSO. First time was a Friday night at 7:30pm and there was a 45 minute wait so we said no thank you. This time was came in a Sunday at 6pm. Found parking and no waiting line. Just perfect.   The guy sat us in a booth inside. Very modern looking with really upbeat music going on. Huge bar with a very big bicycle in the middle of the bar. Very clean with a good vibe with really good ambiance and fairly loud inside. The guy who seated us also got us our water cups. He even got my wife hot water in a pot. This was even before our waitress greeted us. Very nice. He probably wasn't that busy.   Anyways, since we really haven't been here before we ask the waitress for any recommendations. She recommended the Steak + Fries. So that's what we started off with. Huge fries with pieces of steak on top with a creamy white sauce and some greens (sorry I don't know what the greens were). It was really good. Everyone loved it. We even almost licked the plate. Outstanding. The white sauce was so good. Steak was very tender with that white sauce. Yum yum good.   I ordered the Diablo Burger with chipotle ketchup and jack cheese with a sweet bun. It was good. Not spicy at all. Not a lot of flavor but a huge thick juicy burger. So it was okay. Sweet potato fries were normal. Nothing special but good.   My wife ordered the Chicken Waldorf wrap. She said the it was very dry didn't have a sauce in it but had cherries and apricots which really made the wrap. So it was okay. Would she order again? Probably not.   My son ordered the BBQ burger and my daughter ordered the AZ burger. My son really likes his burger with BBQ sauce and bacon and my daughter likes her burger and said it was a little spicy. They both enjoyed it.   So our server was really good. Always checking up on us. Refilling our cups and asking if we need anything else. Very good service. So really good service, good food, and a great atmosphere. What else could you ask for. Interesting, fun and relaxing place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"We were there on Dog day when people bring their dogs in. Really??? The level of music makes it difficult to talk. Not for people over 22"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing overall.  First off, they say they are a distillery, what they should say is that they are a distillery in planning since they aren't making any spirits at this time.  The food menu is an exact duplicate of their Arcadia location and the quality was comparable. Not the best-not the worst.  The location is nice, the decor is pleasent and the staff was friendly. Rotating taps as their other location so that's a plus with a good mix of local and non local craft beers."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot and pleased (and relieved) that they were open until midnight on Sundays - big deal since many of the restaurants in the surrounding area close at 9pm.  We ordered the spicy fried chicken sandwich with the chicken & kale soup as a side dish. Both were fantastic.  We also ordered the ahi and calamari appetizer. Loved the spicy sauce on the calamari rings but the ahi was a bit too peppery.  I think they could also bump up the portion of the calamari rings also. Great meal for a late Sunday night.  Will be back to check out the beer next time."}
{"text":"Had to find a place quickly for family and dogs to eat after Music Instrument Museum. This was outstanding. So dog friendly on patio!  Water and free biscuits but also great food, beer and service from Lizz.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio and delicious food. Pet friendly. We ordered burgers from the late night menu which starts at 10 pm. We also got pretzels which were small but really good. I was a fan of the extensive beer selection  especially my fav, Bells Oberon, which isn't found here very often.   We loved the food, drinks, and atmosphere, but the service was super slow. That's my reason for three stars instead of four. These guys just opened though so we'll have to give them another try here soon.   You really can't beat the price... two beers, two orders of pretzels, iced tea, and a burger and fries - $35.00!!"}
{"text":"On a rare trek to Scottsdale, we decided to try out OHSO since we had seen one of their other locations featured on Check Please! Arizona.  This place was very busy even at 4pm on a Saturday. We sat inside at a booth near the bar and it was quite comfortable. My husband ordered the pretzel board for an appetizer and samples five of the beers. The pretzel board was good. I liked that it wasn't as heavy as at a lot of places. That salami! Seriously good and fresh.  My husband loved the queso dip to go with the bread, while I munched on the pickles and little corn nuts. The bar had just tapped one of their house beers, macadamia nut amber, and out of all the samples my husband liked that the best so he ordered a pint.  Our service was great. The wait for food was perfectly reasonable and our waitress was by regularly to check on us.   My main dish was the Chicken Waldorf Wrap with a side salad. That was a seriously good wrap. It wasn't heavy on the yogurt and had a really strong variety of textures and flavors. The wrap was tasty, too. The side salad was small but was very fresh and I liked the citrus vinaigrette. I'd order the whole plate again.  Our son is autistic and a very picky eater, but he loves tortilla chips. We asked for chips alone and the waitress obliged without a hitch. These are SERIOUSLY good chips, too. Our son loved them and we were impressed, too. Probably among the better chips in the Phoenix area--up there with the Taco Guild's.  My husband felt like being somewhat healthy, so he had the Caesar Salad with added chicken. He said it was quite good.   Since this is a week to celebrate, my husband ordered a slice of apple crumb pie, too. This is his favorite kind of pie--the sort he wants me to make at the holidays. He said this one was very good, though not as good as mine. I'd agree. The apple and caramel combo was perfect, though the thin crust had gone soft. Still, a darn good slice of pie.  We're now even more eager to visit other OHSO locations!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch on the weekends. The staff is friendly and they have a dog friendly patio which is a plus! They even provide house made dog biscuits."}
{"text":"I love the fact we can bring our dogs they give them water and treats...the food is good and everyone is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow, great Sunday brunch! $10 for a breakfast entrée (I got french toast that came with berries) and a mimosa (or you can opt for a local AZ beer).  Loved the mimosa and they give you a generous amount. Though I didn't get another one I think they were only like $6. Love a great deal! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Total let down.  None of the charm of the one on Camelback. Not sure if the people who work here have ever even been to the original to understand what is all about.  Seems like every other Scottdale joint.  Yuppy, played out and lame."}
{"text":"Any place with a seperate back room to store and serve 100+ whiskeys is my kinda joint.   Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. Very interesting menu for bar food. Had a great, lean turkey burger. Everyone else in our party was pleased as well. What did put us off was the table next to us ( outdoor patio ) was letting their dogs drink out of the bar glasses. Yes this is due to their arrogance and ignorance but the waitress didn't say anything to them, which was disturbing. I surely hope that this is not acceptable practice."}
{"text":"Nice bartenders. Good beer selection! The Del Mar Mac & Cheese was amazing, giant shrimp and jalapeños gave it a kick. Too bad we don't have an OHSO closer to us but we will visit this location when we are back in area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times on the weekend and never had to wait. My husband and I have each tried a few different meals and they have been great.  Also took a family member who requires gluten free and they had an entire menu just for the diet requirements (including vegan) with LOTS of options! The seating outside is really nice on a warm or cool day. Lots of overhangs and spacious tables."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Food was fresh, well-spiced, reasonably priced, and well-portioned. Our waitress was terrific- she split every item for us to share. The Guac was delicious, Mexican salad was delicious, and gluten free diablo burger was delicious. Their gluten free bun is among the best I've had!"}
{"text":"The best Mac n' cheese ever. Excellent beer with a lot of options. There burgers are awesome. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend. Bring your dog, they love dogs!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. SERIOUSLY HORRIBLE. I ordered the Chicken and Kale soup. There's BARELY any chicken and NO KALE!! All beans and corn. My dad got the steak and fries. NO. STEAK. NONE. Like TWO pieces! I mean come on. What is going on with this place? Service was just OKAY. We had to wave the waitress down for drinks. She was not coming up to us. Just once to get out order. Hope you guys read this and fix these problems! Don't be stingy with your meat and bring out warm soup not cold!"}
{"text":"Really good avocado toast! Went on a Sunday around 11 for brunch and didn't have to wait. Lots of dogs! Outdoor seating was kept cool with the misters."}
{"text":"we love this place, stumbled on it while looking for dog friendly venues and fell in love with it. We are there at least once a week, usually more. Great atmosphere and staff and great beer, what more could you ask for! We recommend it constantly, and every time we do we get rave reviews and thanks."}
{"text":"The Perfect Restaurant Patio  - loads of dogs, sunshine, and great service! If you've got a pup, and want to chill outside on a beautiful Arizona day, I highly recommend O.H.S.O.  Not only is the food great, but they had the cutest treats made especially for their puppy guests!  The staff is on it when it comes to offering treats and water to their 4-legged patrons. Ours even had his photo taken for their DOGGY WALL~.   There were 5 of us and the appetizers came out in waves - which was nice. i recommend the guac and chips! for lunch, I ordered the burger with cheese ( with bacon and melty gouda) and sweet potato fries.  Simple. Hit the spot! If you're so inclined, O.H.S.O. offers gluten free and vegan options. The waitstaff was a little slack at the end when we were ready to pay and couldn't find them for a long long long time and had to physically track them down to hand them our CC - which is the reason why I am deducting a star. Overall a wonderful experience - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio, plenty of space and great menu. Love the happy hour here and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I eat out more than a dozen times a month due to work travel and this was the worst dining experience I've had in a while. Place was 2/3 full and it took 10 minutes to get a water and a menu. 20 more minutes to get a salad after finally ordering. Had a Kale/Pear salad that was OK but it had obviously been plated before being dressed and all the dressing was dumped in the middle. The Grilled Salmon BLT wasn't too bad but by the time it arrived, I was already pretty much done with this place. The whole atmosphere of the place was a trying-too-hard amalgam of a sports bar, high end gastropub and a Chilis."}
{"text":"Jimmy & Tim provide the best service around. I was a bartender for 4 years and wow!! Just wow. Great cocktails, delicious food, and fast service. 5 stars all day every day"}
{"text":"Where shall I begin? On our first trip to Scottsdale and our first meal out, we are so pleased that we came to O.H.S.O. We sat at the bar and we were well taken care of. Our bartender was Courtney...who made us fabulous cocktails, recommended the best beers and gave us some great tips for how to spend the rest of our week. Courtney makes a mean sazerac, and does it all with a super fun attitude.   We each ordered a salmon based entree. I had the Salmon steak and was not disappointed. It came on a bed of Israeli couscous, citrus beurre blanc and fire grilled asparagus. My partner in crime had the salmon BLT and it was amazing as well. Hearty and fresh pieces of salmon, fresh asparagus the size of tree trunks and really excellent house made sauces.   The brewery also has ventured into making spirits. The manager Eric was nice enough to come around and chat us up and give us a sample of the vodka and the gin. Both were smooth and well balanced with little aftertaste. I was surprised actually, as most in house spirits I have tried were similar to gasoline.  We loved our night at O.H.S.O. They are open late and have a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating. From our conversations with Eric and some of the Yelp reviews I have read, it seems as though we may make it back here for weekend brunch one day soon! Thanks for a great experience O.H.S.O"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. I've been wanting to come here for some time and am so glad I finally made it here. I love the open atmosphere of this palce. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers you can't beat. ex. A pitcher of beer for 6 bucks and not just the domestic beer. I had the brisket sandwich......simply delicious with the jalapeño cole slaw. This is a must if you haven't already tried Ohso."}
{"text":"I have been to this new location of OHSO twice now. The first time we were headed to Four Peaks but decided to try something new when we pulled in the parking lot. We waited quite some time for our server to greet the table. My boyfriend sampled 2 beers and asked for a full pint of one of the ones he tried and the sever brought him something completely different, lame. Then we waited 30 min (+) for 2 salads and it wasn't even busy. Also my salad came out wrong, but I kept it anyway as I did not want to wait and we were going to catch a movie. The 2nd time I went in was with friends from the restaurant I work at. We sat at the bar and again the service was not very good. When I sat down all 4 people I was with said they have never gotten good service at this location. I know what it's like to open a new restaurant and whip servers into shape, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but I think we will stick to Four Peaks, right next door."}
{"text":"OHSO is oh so awesome! Such a fun spot for beer [LOTS of beer], food, and general hanging out. I've been here a few times with my coworkers for lunch and happy hour. We've yet to have a poor time. Service is always an A+, and they are always down to give drink/food suggestions and refill our water glasses and beer pitchers. If you arrive early enough for lunch, you'll have a selection of seating, otherwise if you get caught up in the lunch rush, might be relegated to squeezing together for space, if with a group.   OHSO is great at beer. period. They have a rotating selection of Arizona beers, their own taps, and some national beers. Be warned though, if you want to get a sample, those will cost you about $2/per. I'm a huge fan of the Popsicle Blonde, it's a refreshing beer, not overtly sweet, to drink during the extreme heat. I've also had their black IPA which doesn't have the crunchy-punch of hops, but still a good beer. It's quite a steal to only pay about $6 for a pitcher for their local brews!   The food menu is fairly average for a brewery place - appetizers/munchies, salads, burgers, dessert, etc. Their burgers are massive and delicious, but the fries/onion rings are nothing to be excited about. The best salad on the menu is the Ensalada Del Sol, it has a bunch of flavors to it. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous waited an hour for a chicken salad, and that's because they messed up my order. I asked for no dressing! Then had to wait another 35 min for a fresh one! Received my other salad, and it was basically the same salad. Same mistake! I asked for a menu, wanting to order an appetizer, never received it! My husband asked for a refill on his soda, never received that! I would like to rate this place better, but I just can't! Service was ridiculous. I've worked in the service industry so I can have some compassion and understand how it can be when slammed, but this was unacceptable. Not to mention waiter seemed quick to hand out checks, and clean tables, than to check on my order! But I must to say the manager was extremely nice, went and got me my 3rd salad in less than 5 minutes! And it was made perfect this time! Finally!!! she was nice enough to comp it from our check!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere menu and service !! Ohso stands for outrageous home brew social outpost ! Ya perfecto !"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in N Scottsdale... PERIOD. You really can't beat the prices on small bites and mini pitchers of local craft beer."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for brunch and have been very happy!  Crowd isn't too overwhelming, they pour amazing mimosas and the brunch deals are awesome!  I have had the avocado toast a couple times and loved it. My family raves about the burgers. This place is super dog friendly so bring the pup!"}
{"text":"I love ohso! This new location is great, I love the pulled pork and the fact that I can bring my pup! Great beer as well!! Service is always excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Tour & tastings at OHSO. I already love the chicken and waffles and now I find they have the smoothest gin ever and if you ever tried flavored vodkas, they can't be beat. Cucumber horseradish jalapeno coffee and more. Great people friendly and informative. Oh yeah, and try the peppermint beer."}
{"text":"I was sitting in a Thai Restaurant no less than 500ft away, when I saw Tricia F's check in for OHSO.  Since I was waiting for my daily special to arrive, I perused the photos from OHSO and made plans to swing by.  Today was a day made for al fresco burgers and pie at OHSO.  The sun warmed me as light breezes visited my table.  I was a little apprehensive about going with another burger, given the let down experience at Rehab Burger Therapy.  It was just too soon... but I had missed the AYCE Backyard BBQ cutoff time, so a BBQ Burger it was!  I was very pleased with the taste, and since I ordered it med rare, it oozed wonderful juice subsequent to every luscious bite, which the substantial bun sopped up.  The fries were nice, thin, shoestring, with a sprinkle of chopped parsley.  I dont know, I'm just making stuff up now.  The pies de resistance (which is weird, because the word 'pie' is in the phrase), was the Caramel Apple Pie from that one good pie place.  I think it's called like Pie Snob or something.  It was worth going up a jeans size for.  I take that back.  It wasnt worth it... because now I'm going to have to go out and try on some jeans, and I can never find a size that fits me right out of the gate.  It's always like 4 trips back and forth.  Take tight jeans off, try fat jeans on, look in mirror with disgusted expression, take fat jeans off, squeeze back into them darned tight jeans again, and waddle back to the display to rife through stacks of folded pants to find a different size.  But the pie was really good"}
{"text":"EVERY single time I go here I am not disappointed. Salmon BLT with sweet potato fries, tacos, brisket mac& cheese, AZ burger, and the veggie burger= FANTASTIC. I will be back very soon. Cool vibe and love the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday, and order some of their breakfast box items  I ordered the avocado toast which was a slice of bread, not toasted and had some avocado, and two slices of tomato that did not look good at all, the eggs were not cooked well, I will not recommend this place to eat, it is a place to have a drink, but the food was terrible. I will not comeback there, felt sick after, did not touched the eggs, nor the potatoes."}
{"text":"Love this place and location! Friendly and wonderful service always! Great open and enjoyable atmosphere as well. Happy hour pitchers of beer! Golden. Sunday brunches with a mimosa or Bloody Mary is Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Portions are getting smaller. I went recently and had the tacos, they were tiny, really tiny.  I went back and had the pork it was also tiny. The server asked,\"if I would like anything else?\" I was thinking yes the rest of the meal.  The atmosphere is good, except when people put their dogs in the booths, then its like eating in a kennel.  I like the place."}
{"text":"Great brunch! 10 for a huge plate of food and either beer or mimosa.  Food is excellent, lacks some spice but you can request salsa, jam, etc. mimosas are mostly champagne which is fine by me!  Great service and lots of space for big groups."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and brother when they were in town over Christmas. The patio wasn't open at the time but when we asked to sit outside they didn't hesitate to open it for us and make sure we had a clean table to eat on. It was a tad chilly so they brought over a heat lamp to our table without us even asking. I had the pilgrim sandwich which was delicious and my brother had the Mac and cheese which is popular and probably the best (adult) Mac and cheese I've ever tasted! Service was great also!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I like the food at the OHSO Airport location better than this place.. Since the beer is awesome, I will give it another try though..   Had \"The Brisket\" .. Not sure if it was really brisket, but was super dry, even with the added sauces... This wouldn't be a Brisket I would ever buy as a cut of meat, and definitely wont order it again..   But , they do BEER correctly.. yes, liquid lunch in the future.."}
{"text":"One of the most awesome places I have ever been to...First: great menu Second: Very reasonable Prices Third: Dog friendly patio Fourth: Great atmosphere...Fifth: great service by adorable Andrea who kept checking on us the whole time..  Went on a Saturday for brunch with a friend and I was not disappointed..Menu was great and varied Had the bagel and lox which came with a huge Mimosa: almost big enough to share."}
{"text":"Besides the expensive prices, which turned out to be pretty reasonable, the food is really good if I say so myself. Definitely try the BBQ burger, it's big, tasty and you won't regret it afterwards. There are variety of drinks to choose from the menu, whether it's beers to wine. Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"This is a local hangout where my friends and I regularly have our weekend Brunch.   Last Saturday, for the first time,  I chose fried chicken and waffles and I now know why it's such a popular dish.   My three waffles were perfectly thick and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   They had a subtle vanilla flavor.  They were served with a spicy maple syrup that I did not like and thankfully I had ordered the syrup on the side because it's normally poured on top of the waffles and it would have ruined my breakfast.  My two large chicken breasts had a crunchy coating that I might describe as a corn flake coating mixed with seasoning.   The chicken was moist and flavorful and deliciously spicy and I savored the waffles and ckn  combined together.   Three thick bacon strips topped off the plate.   Oh,  and don't forget the beer or mimosa that's also included in the $15.00 price.  I have a large appetite and finished every bite,  but realistically, two can easily share one meal.  For the rest of the day,  I was craving another plate of fried chicken and waffles!!"}
{"text":"3 and a half stars, but I'll round up ;).  I came here for my birthday dinner because that was where my friend wanted to go.   We were seated within 15 minutes which was great, but it was also because we had an early dinner. They were packed pretty fast for a Friday evening, which I'm assuming is standard.   Service is welcoming and our waitress was exceptionally friendly. She went above and beyond even with how busy she was. It took awhile to get her attention a few times, but I've been a waitress before so I know the struggle.   Their pie was DELICIOUS, which surprised me because I do not like pay at all. So whatever bakery it is from, it is A+.   Food was good, but nothing special or mind blowing. Price was standard for portion and taste.   The outdoor patio and game area was awesome. Love how family oriented it is!"}
{"text":"Whenever someone asks for a recommendation for a nice place to eat in North Scottsdale I recommend this everytime. Great food their couscous is bomb. I also recommend the AZ burger, brisket is also money. Great craft beer, with an awesome dog friendly patio you cannot beat this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Got the AZ burger. Amazing. Maybe could have been a bit spicier. SO got the surf and turf. Great sauce. Lots of shrimp. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make of this place. I want to say it's a great place to go have a beer and to a certain extent it is. However, you're not gonna find common beers here, they are a craft house which is cool and there are some great beers, but sometimes I just want something familiar (yes, you can sample anything you want, but still).   I also wish I could say it's a great place to catch a game, but it's not - only because they never have sound to them and watching a game without sounds is odd.   Finally, the food is decent. I usually get the grilled chicken which is probably their healthiest option and it's actually very good.  One thing I should mention is they do have a very delicious Moscow Mule. They make their own mix and do a great job!   Service can be hit or miss. Lately, it's been good, but there have been a few occasions where we've had to request a different server and once I even had to report the manager due to his boorish attitude.  I'd say give it a shot."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich and Mac del mar are both delicious.  Portion sizes are good and ingredients are high quality. We really enjoyed the apple pie as well!"}
{"text":"Sunday Barbecue at OHSO! For $15, you get all'a dis (with refills! You probably won't want a refill, though, unless you're an Ork.) - 2 BBQ chicken breasts - Pulled pork - BBQ brisket  - Cornbread - Baked beans - Spicy green apple slaw - Potato salad - Lima beans and corn  For those of us with a substantial, but more human-person-like appetite, there's the BBQ Bacon Burger: - aforementioned menu description words - Crunchy onion straws - American cheese (the good kind)  The Sunday Barbecue plate is a ball-out-all-you-can-eat-treat, but I think the BBQ Bacon Burger was one of the best that I've had. Between the all-American Southern comfort food, the buzzin' flies, and the friendly-but-slightly-awkward service, I felt just like I was at a new neighbor's BBQ. Consider this my RSVP to the next one."}
{"text":"They make vodka. I wasn't hung over. Vodka is good.  My hubs loved their beer list. I love how they have a HUGE patio for dogs! A whole set up. Never seen any place do that. Very impressed.  Hosts were kinda lame, no personality, never smiled.  It's ok our server was great, knowledgable, attentive. Menu was decent. Didn't take long to decide.  Blackened salmon is ALWAYS a must when on a menu. Also steak and shrimp salsa mixture. Idk what that was called, but I expected plain boring steak with shrimp... It was good, just not what I was in the mood for. Husband loved it. I ate the salmon, sooo good. Asparagus was good.   They sell vodka, so we bought a bottle for $25. It was good, and I tend to be a snob, Smirnoff and below is a solid no way. And this was very good vodka. Didn't get a headache or hung over. And my hubs made me do a few shots (which I don't do very often) and I still felt fine in the morning!!!"}
{"text":"I love OHSO, I've been to the Arcadia location and the newer North Scottsdale location. While I love the larger more private atmosphere of the Arcadia location, the Scottsdale one is close to work so I make it there more.   Love the happy hour (cheap pitchers!) and of course love the patio seating. I've never even sat inside. I usually get appetizers. I've had the ceviche, pretzel board, cheese plate and calamari and ahu tuna. The ahi tuna was my favorite by far.   The brunch menu is hard to beat. Its exactly my style, a few good options, not overwhelming with too many options. The breakfast burrito is my reigning favorite.   And of course bring your dogs or a take a treat to go for them!"}
{"text":"It's like 'Cheers' for pets ! We frequent weekly and the staff is friendly and efficient ! One of our favorite severs moved away but they're are so many others ! Food is great .. Although they don't participate in football packages we love it there .. Sorry if no football in Sunday's then we go somewhere else .. They said they don't wavy to be another sports bar. Too bad .. Doggies like football too you know !! It's okay we will pick another day to go ! Love it there ..."}
{"text":"We ordered the pretzel board and it was served completely cold, pretzels and cheese dip. Beer was mediocre at best. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pet friendly yes!! Extremely! But, brunch wise.... Eggs have no flavor and seems very mass produced. They reminded me of the eggs you get with a free breakfast at a hotel. The service was great though! I think honestly I will try it again just because of the service! Great outdoor seating and brunch comes with a free drink!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place for brunch! And why you ask?  $10.00 gets you a big plate of food & mimosa/beer. That's a deal! When the weather is nice you can definitely sit out on the patio, watch football, and hangout with friends. Kid and pet friendly as well.   I got the veggie burger which was pretty good. I was scared it was gonna be dry, but it wasn't! The AZ burger is a must try. Steak and Fries are great for appetizers and to share with friends.   The only reason I can't give this place a 5 star was bc our waitress was kinda horrible. The manager was nice though! We were told that we couldn't fit inside the booth (group was 8) and the waitress  we can only fit 6. We proved her wrong. We are such tiny girls and definitely had a lot of room to move. Hate the judgement. Also she placed in the wrong order for my friend and didn't think she was wrong even when the whole table heard what my friend had ordered.   Overall I would give this place a try because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio.  It has lights and heat lamps so it's perfect at night.  The best part about it is that it's not facing a busy street.  It's facing their parking lot which buffers the street. Service was great here.  They have a great selection of beverages.  Pretzel bites didn't fill me up so next time I'll need a bigger appetizer. Also, if you have a dog you can bring the dog on the patio here and they even have dog treats."}
{"text":"I have always loved all of their locations. I love the food and that they have a very dog friendly patio. This was our first time at this location. There was no wait and we were seated on the patio.    I ordered the hummus and it was absolutely delicious. The only downfall was the waitress didn't remember our orders, and that's probably because she should've wrote it down."}
{"text":"Plus side - huge beer selection( they let you sample which is nice), awesome dog friendly patio, people watching is phenomenal, pretty extensive food menu, nice vibe - not too loud or sporty - all ages, genders and persuasions. Service is quick, unobtrusive and low key.   Negatives - too many beards. Employees are all guys in hipster street clothes, so any random bro in an American eagle t-shirt, faded flannel and two day old stubble can pose as your server.  Sort of odd.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, the food is always good and it's such a fun atmosphere! Definitely a place we frequent often! Highly recommend the Mac and cheese, it's the best Mac and cheese I've had from any restaurant!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but the gin and vodka is quite tasty. The bloody didn't disappoint. And I left with two bottles each of the gin and vodka in Mizzou bottles. The bottles alone are the 4 stars. I would have given 5 but the bottles weren't big enough. Lol"}
{"text":"I only had the seafood Mac and cheese here, but I thought it was great, with plenty of fairly large shrimp popping out as I kept digging into my bowl. The leftovers were even better in the morning!   There is a large selection of drinks which I would come back to try and it seems like a decent place for a larger group. I liked the outdoor seating and there were plenty of big booths. Service was pretty standard for a pub/tavern, but we didn't have any complaints. Plus, this place is dog friendly so we got to see a few cute pups, which is always a plus when on the road!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Staff is friendly, and the place is pet friendly as well.   Fun place to watch a game or just get a few drinks.   Food is good and service is pretty quick.   If you haven't made it out to this place yet, definitely worth checking it out."}
{"text":"Just reviewing the food, it was just plain NOT tasty at all. Uninspired tastebuds.  The booze must be really freakin awesome to get them the 4 stars, but we're not drinkers.  To recap, not good for sober foodies."}
{"text":"This place continues to surprise me each time I visit. Went for a date night with the husband tonight m, and it was our first non-brunch visit. First, I should mention that the weekend brunch special alone is worth a visit ($10 per person for food and a beer or huge mimosa is a deal, but this good is amazing and the list of local brews is always rotating and sure to offer something for any beer drinker). Second, the atmosphere is very relaxed chic with bicycle theme throughout.   So, tonight we went for drinks and dinner. We missed happy hour, but we're pretty hungry so we shared the pretzel board (salty pretzels rolls, warm cheese dip, toasted corn nuts, baby pickles, dry salami, and mustard). Definitely a good snack for two people. I tried the white sangria (a nice, rather sweet pineapple-based drink), and my husband enjoyed his white chocolate ale (smelled and tasted so good). He usually orders the coffee stout (from Papago), but they were out of stock.   For dinner, we had The Pilgrim (turkey sandwich) and the veggie burger--both with fries. The turkey was good, but the veggie burger was absolutely the best veggie burger I have ever eaten. It had a spicy sweet sauce with avocado and chopped tomatoes, a soft potato-like bun, and they even charred/flame-kissed the burger giving it a wonderful flavor and texture. So, so good!! Fries were simple but memorable and a perfect combo with the sandwiches. Good enough to order alone as a snack too. I think I'll try the steak and fries starter next time if I can manage to order anything other than the veggie burger."}
{"text":"We tried OHSO for the first time last Sunday late morning, had family in town and decided to try OHSO after a neighbor told us they are regulars for Sunday brunch. The entire back room was being taken over by some really rude girls having a bridal shower or some kind of party. We had great service from a cute blond waitress Kelsey (Kelsie?), she helped us find another location to sit (away from the bridezilla party) and she really knew the menu and drink offerings.  My brother considers himself a top beer connoisseur and can be a challenge for most wait staff but she really knew her stuff and didn't miss a beat.  And it wasn't about the tip, my neighbor said that OHSO \"tip pools\" so they all share tips. There's no better place to enjoy the beautiful weather, toast and toss back a few brews than OHSO."}
{"text":"Amazing beer! Happy hour prices are great deal. Huge selection of craft beers on tap. Their orange blossom beer is my favorite. I'm not a dog person, but I can see how it would be a nice place to bring your dog."}
{"text":"Great little spot for craft beer and home distilled liquor. Excellent addition to the neighborhood. Friendly and helpful staff great food at a reasonable price. Was there the second night open and it was very busy. Congratulations G. Also hear there is a new one coming on Tatum and Shea soon."}
{"text":"You won't find a better mimosa this side of town. Great tables and shade, great music, great food (Avacado Toast,Sunday BBQ) great service and dogs allowed!!! Not one bad thing about this place."}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary. Started out with the asylum wine- awesome suggestion from Nichole! Ordered the Mac del mar..... Omg yum! It was filled meat galore- crab, shrimp and BACON! Such a yummy, creamy, filling dish. Ended the night with the Carmel apple pie. Delish as well. Overall great experience. Very attentive service! My wine was always filled so you can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot! Dog friendly patio and great food and bar! Service is dialed and they don't skimp on the portions or drinks!! Xo OsHo"}
{"text":"Although I love their outdoor patio, I've got to give 2 stars. There are disgusting filters sitting in a planter on the patio, which makes me wonder how filthy their kitchen must be.   Fun for brunch, especially if you like your eggs with a Bloody Mary or mimosa. Very few gluten-free breakfast options so I've gotten the breakfast burrito bowl a couple of times. It's just okay - not enough pico de gallo or guacamole & this time it was served luke warm, as was my daughter's French toast. My daughter did not like her dish at all & only ate two bites. We told the server this but she did not take it off the bill.   Dinner here is decent - my husband loved his spicy surf and turf. Salads are tasty.  The last time I came here, I received slow, rude service so I didn't come back for about a year. Based on our experience today, I don't think I'll ever return unless it's just for a drink on the patio."}
{"text":"Where are all the house beers?  Are they no good?  Hmmm...  Distillery offerings were not yet available.  Food was about the same as the other location, with parking being much better at the new spot.  Service was slow and inattentive.  Odd seeing some of the attitudes by bartenders on display, as though they are doing customers a favor.  What the heck?    Good selection of guest taps, however."}
{"text":"LOVE OHSO!!! All the locations, but especially the Indian School location. I thought this location would feel stuffy but it didn't! We have had excellent service. I am not particularly a fan of dogs in restaurants, but OHSO does a great job of allowing them without taking away from others' experiences. If I'm not in the mood for Fido, I go somewhere else...and think about all the yummy beers I'm missing! Or, I fill my growler and go. Rant over.  The beer list is AMAZING here. The OHSO beers are fun and unique and they actually encourage you to try them! The staff has been fantastic at all three locations. They often make their own judgements on samples for you if you describe what you like. They had usually hit it right on the head for me.   The brunch at OHSO is great, try chicken and waffles or avocado toast. The burgers are really good. Always cooked as ordered. I usually end up taking my burger off the bun, but not at OHSO...the buns are so soft and tasty. The fries are not great, but not bad either. Take em or leave em. One particular memorable meal was when I ordered the pork belly on jalapeno polenta. This was some of the best pork belly I have ever had. The veggies were interesting, but underwhelming. They had potential: brussel sprouts, radishes, carrots, other stuff. They were supposed to be roasted, but I think they were hurried a bit and tasted more steamed than roasted. I will give them another shot. Everything else on the plate was delish. My friend had the BBQ brisket mac and cheese and it looked decadent. She loved it. Their little $3 nibble samplers at Happy Hour are also fun. Loved the crab wontons, but thought the deviled egg dip was a bit bland.   But, to be honest, we usually just come for the beers. I love their morning brew, which is a light coffee beer; the Popsicle Blonde, which I believe is raspberry lemon; and...wait for it...the Blood Orange IPA. Yes, I just said love and IPA in the same sentence. There have been so many others, like CocoCaptainCrunch or something, which was like dessert after brunch. Don't go online to see their selection. It is not updated and doesn't do the selection justice. They always have WAY more choices. Just go there. You will find something.   The distillery is also unique and fun. I am a fan of their gin.   Go to any of the OHSO locations. They all have a unique vibe. They all have great service and good food. They all have awesome beer."}
{"text":"Steak & Fries dish was Fantastic!!! Cheese plate not so much, but that may be personal preference, the display was pretty.  Great happy hour, $6 mini pitchers & pretzels with jalepeno cheese sauce, wow! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We came in after the Phnx open which was madness and there were so many people, crazy crazy amount of drunk people! The staff here had it all covered, they were on top of everything we didn't have to wait too long, and our waitress was pregnant and so cute! I couldn't stop staring at her little belly. We ordered pretty much every appetizer on the menu and I would say the crab dip was my fav. I would definitely recommend grabbing some of that to start.  They are also dog friendly and have cute tables outside so we will be back with our little pups.  Good times, good vibe & we will be back again & again."}
{"text":"So we've been going here for several years as regulars.  Had a very bad experience with \"Timmy\", the regular bartender who was clearly interested in a pair for \"females\" more than serving us regulars.  Got a skimpy set of fries with my burger and asked him if the cook could spare a few more, like 6 more!  Tells me I can have some extra fries for $5, and he was serious.  I said ok but never got them because he was more interested in the girls at the bar than us regulars.  I tried to talk to the manager, hoping to get a small amount of sympathy, or a few fries.  No dice.  Asked him if it was worth losing a long time customer over a skimpy set of fries and he had no response.  So left for good."}
{"text":"Fun place to people watch and lounge under the blessed fans and misters. Enjoyed our appetizer place and the house liquers."}
{"text":"This place has nice outdoor seating, and a good atmosphere. The brisket, and it was very good, although the bottom bun was a little soggy. I tried multiple samples of beers they brewed, all very nice!  A good place for friends to catch up. It was a Friday night and fairly busy, so there was a 30 minute wait and the server was slow to take our order. Additionally, I was sad that they did not offer soup like the Arcadia O.H.S.O. does. Overall, a nice place, and I'd reccommend it."}
{"text":"my family and i went on a wednesday afternoon and they were still pretty busy. we sat on the patio and had the sweetest waitress! she gave us recommendations, was very knowledgeable of the menu, drinks, etc. i got the grilled cheese with prosciutto and it was crazy good. 10/10 will be coming back"}
{"text":"Jimmy makes a mean Old Fashion. One of the main reasons I frequent OHSO is because of the bar staff. Must try new #vodka and #gin."}
{"text":"We really love the Indian School location and the newest location at Shea and Tatum is the best!  Can't beat the drink menu and they have a great happy hour!  (Try the pretzels).  Pooch friendly on the patio is a +.  The service and food are up to par, but for better ambiance, try one of the other locations."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner on New Years Eve and the place was pretty empty to the point that we did not know if they were open.   We ordered the Kailua Pork and the Mac Del Mar. The Mac Del Mar was a cross between a macaroni casserole and mac and cheese with shrimp and crab. Good number of shrimp but could not see the crab if there were any. The Mac Del Mar however was very good and would highly recommend.  The Kailua Pork wa as over potatoes and was pretty good. Think we made some pretty good choices.   As we sat waiting for our food the other tables ordered burgers which looked pretty big and good.   The service was good and fairly quick and will come back again to try a burger"}
{"text":"We were sitting out in the patio area on a Saturday night. Surprisingly it wasn't as busy as it thought it would. Service was great and a bottle of wine was half price of after 10pm. Their appetizer was only average. We ordered a Thai hummus and the buns with dipping sauce. I will probably come back here for another bottle of wine, but will probably not come back for the food."}
{"text":"Love it here!! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, you can bring your pup, the drinks are made well and their burgers are A-mazing!! (Actually haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't fabulous)"}
