{"text":"I placed a fairly expensive order on a Sunday at approximately noon for a family event. I arrived to pick it up and they were just finishing the wing order. Paid for order and went home. I couldn't have been more shocked. My pizza was three different colors and size pieces (out of place/ don't match). I realized suddenly they were left over from a previous day's slice pizza you get at the counter if you went in for slice. That's right! I was sold day old, used pizza. The wings were also soggy and I was already pissed so I counted them. I was 9 wings short on my order. Considering the exorbitant cost ($50) this was a decent amount of missing product. As I sit here writing this and looking back I realize I should have been weary when I was told by the owner i should have ordered \"the special\" it would have been cheaper and then paid for extra wings. Treated me like he had me on price because of a technicality. I didnt know to ask for special. I am forwarding my complaint to Union county health department. If you do visit check out salt, pepper, garlic, shakers etc. They have a disgusting layer of stickiness on them. I would never return except to get my money back if they offered it. I will and have been telling all my friends. Thinking about sitting in parking lot one Friday night with a sign saying \" ask me about the used food I was sold\""}
{"text":"Not bad pizza but the specials taped to the counter look ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love the chicken rolls.  I prefer North Italian pizzerias & those are hard to find down here."}
{"text":"GREAT authentic Italian \"Mom & Pop\" eatery!! I had an incredible Bruschetta pizza --- I thoroughly recommend!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Jack's because it is a little bit closer than my usual place. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and dessert (tiramisu). The order was ready really quick and the old Italian man that owns the pizza shop is very nice. However if you are looking for great NY style pizza etc this is not that. The pizza tasted like a subpar heat and serve grocery store pizza and the tiramisu was not anything special, it was a small slice and was still frozen. For great NY pizza go to Brooklyn Pizza parlor down the road in Wesley Chapel. I won't be coming back to Jack's."}
{"text":"If you are from here and you have not yet tried jacks pizzeria, you don't know what real pizza taste like! I am from New York and Jack's matches if not it exceeds any quality that you will find anywhere near New York pizza!!! do yourself a favor and try  Jack's pizza!! outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and each time has been great. The peeled egg plant parm. is to die for in my book. The pizza is one of the best in the area. I can never leave there without getting a chocolate canolli. They are so addictive. Thanks Jack for bringing your art, and culture, to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. Give it a try if you miss NYC. 

Jack is a good guy from Brooklyn.
His food is on the money. Great ingredients."}
{"text":"Had pizza with my wife and friend today. Absolutely theBEST pizza I've had in years. Authentic New York Pizza from an authentic New York Pizzeria!!  We will surely return!"}
{"text":"Coming from living in Las Vegas my whole life to Indian Trail, it's been a bit of a culture shock. I am so thankful to have taken a chance on Jack's! The food is made fresh and the cheese pizza is my fave. Give them a shot-you won't be disappointed. Jack's daughter Angela is the best-she delivers sometimes and she's a doll. Get it to go or delivery. It's hot in the store due to the open kitchen and pizza oven (I guess)."}
{"text":"I stopped in to jack's pizza for a quick lunch.  Jack is friendly and gets your food to you quickly.  I had the chicken fingers with fries.  The chicken fingers were decent.  I wanted them BBQ so he just add some on top where I normally expect them to be tossed in BBQ sauce.  The sauce must be a bottle kind, not great.  The fries were good and crunchy.  The overall experience was fine but not fantastic like I hoped.  I will be back to try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Ordered a supreme Sicilian pizza for delivery. Paid a high price which I questioned but figured it must be worth it. Unfortunately it was a horrible pizza. The crust was not fresh and when I called to talk to Jack he offered nothing but sad excuses. Overpriced and not good at all, my first experience with Jacks was not a good one at all. Wouldn't recommend Jacks to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town with great customer service! Jack makes every pizza himself, which always gives you a consistent experience, every time you walk in."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now, once eating there and once delivery.  The food is ok, nothing great or horrible.  Both times having pizza, one regular style and other sicilian.  Both times cold, not a fan of cold pizza when I first order it!  The flavor is ok, cheese reminds of grade school pizza days, not a good thing.  The guy could not take my order correctly to save his life.  Had to almost write it out on paper for him.  Tony's or Athen's Pizza would be my choice."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. For starters, it was not the cleanest. 
The pizza looked good, but was disappointing. Bottom crust soggy. Cheese and sauce, eh. My husband is from Jersey. We know great pizza. We didn't have it this evening."}
{"text":"I used to go here about once a week when I worked in Indian Trail. By the third or so visit, Jack knew what I wanted the second I got to the counter. The guy is super nice and always had my food out a few minutes after I sat down. The pizza is delicious, and the hot wings are flat out addicting. I never felt the need to try anything else, but I hear it's all pretty tasty. This place would be really popular if it were in Charlotte's city limits. As it is, it's my favorite place to eat in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"Jack is the best! Old school work ethic. Everything made by hand using the freshest ingredients. This is the kind of place that if you claim you want to support local businesses, this is the perfect place to support. In a world of cheap, mediocre pizza, cough up the couple extra bucks & get a massive buffalo chicken or special pizza from Jack! Fried raviolis are a must too."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived around the corner from this place for 2 years before I tried it. They have great pizza and wings! I can't review anything else bc I like the fore mentioned items so much. Jack is also a very nice guy."}
{"text":"Seriously great pizza. We've tried many different pizza joints around the Charlotte area and none are as good. Jack uses fresh ingredients that he cuts up in the restaurant, his sauce is AMAZING and if you want it cooked longer for a crisper crust just let him know. Keep in mind Jack is a true NY Italian so do not be offended by him. He is super, super nice!!  
 
(The decor is nothing to brag about but that's not what we go there for!)"}
{"text":"Jacks pizza is bad.I do not know how anybody can not tell this person should not be in  pizza bussiness,he used be in jewelry bussiness and he needs go back to school and learn to add went to his  place 3 times order same pizza and wings and price change  each time plus quality sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Winner:  Best Pizza!  Winner:  Best Cannoli!  Winner:  Best Italian Ice!

After eating dinner five minutes before, I thought I would check this place out, get a 20 Inch Pizza and take most of it home (I did) and when looking over the menu I found Dessert!  While waiting for the Pizza I had a large Cannoli (shell completely dipped in Chocolate) then after the Pizza (only two slices) I had the best Lemon Italian Ice Ever!!!  Someone told me the sauce is sweet (it is) and is very good.  Great Service!  Jack is friendly, polite and humble.  Wait staff is great - Kitchen staff is great!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and the Buffalo wings are huge they are deep fried and the hot sauce is over the top of them you get a dozen and they are a meal on their own and excellent. Has to be the best gluten free pizza I've had he gave me a sample and I would recommend it to everyone.  Crispy, thin and extremely flavorful crust loved the veggie toppings. I don't have a gluten problem but I ordered it tonight based on the sample I had last time I came in. It's that good. The stuffed mushrooms are different but fresh and I like them. He roasts them fresh while you wait and it was tasty stuffing but don't expect sauce or cheese on them . Absolutely excellent eggplant parm sandwich as well. Huge and he makes his eggplant himself. All in all not had a bad meal, always good conversation and they have wine or beer if you choose. Definitely recommend them and big enough for soccer team lunches!!  Fyi... you can pre order zeppoles! I am going to have to do it and try them out my best friend makes them home made 90 year old recipe so I know a good one when I taste it!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this a star. We went here for the 1st time the other night and it was HORRIBLE. I told the guy that my husband didn't feel that the pizza tasted fresh (he got a single slice) he made a huge stink and insisted on arguing with us. Then he only ate 3 of his knots bc he was frustrated with the whole situation and went to smoke a cigarette. The owner then said to me what is his problem? Continued to argue with me and then said we should go to Papa John's next time. I usually am all for left overs bc they taste better the next time around. I went to eat my cheese steak today and it tasted like vomit. Even if the food was great (which it wasn't) I still wouldn't go here if you paid me. We were treated so rudely and very disrespectful. I do not plan on EVER going back here. Francescos in Sun Valley is so much better."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned pizza parlor. I received my food fast and the owner was very friendly. They have a lot of lunch specials at a very reasonable price. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a real deal Italian restaurant. The pizza is unbelievable! Fresh homemade ingredients! Been looking for a place like this close to home just sorry it took me so long!"}
{"text":"Yup, Jack is still AWESOME! Doesn't get more \"Authentic New York\" than Jack's - it's the real deal and so is Jack. Best pizza around, my newest love is \"roasted red pepper and mushroom with extra sauce!\" Gluten free crust, wings, fettucine alfredo with chicken and eggplant parm are our other family faves. A treasure in Indian Trail!"}
{"text":"Walking into Jack's reminds me of old pizza parlors back in Brooklyn.... A family owned business with all meals prepared fresh.  As I struggle with finding good pizza restaurants in NC, Jacks brings that piece of NY often missing in NC...."}
{"text":"Proud owner, very friendly, best pizza in Union County.  Also, serves Cheerwine.  Wings are excellent."}
{"text":"Anyone who says this place has what's close to real Italian pizza has obviously never been to Italy or even Europe.  The cheese taste like processed garbage, and the wings are soaked in sauce making them soggy.  I can definitely see why people are saying the owner is rude; he's Italian and they're generally rude people."}
{"text":"Tried a few times, treated as if I was bothering them even though my son and I were the only or nearly the only in-store patrons. Pizza crust was cardboard-ish the last time I was there, cheese was crusty. Vid had MUCH MUCH better."}
{"text":"Don't let the simple surroundings fool you. Jack's has real Italian New York pizza! We will eat no where else after trying this place a couple weeks ago! High quality ingredients in this pizza and after chatting with Jack you realize that he is straight from NY and a real Italian import!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best around Indian trail I'm just to lazy to drive to Tony's pizza we love that place , about them being a bit rude well you obviously never lived up in nyc I'm from there so it didn't bother me , as far as sauce it's definitely different to me it's bit sour but I can deal with that ! The rest of the fan loves it ! Of don't try to get it delivered lol they usually have some lame excuse"}
{"text":"I don't see why there are good reviews for Jack's Pizza. This is not a good place.  Having recently moved to Indian Trail from Concord, we have been looking for a good NY style pizza place. The pizzas are pretty big, but too thin. And not thin in the good way!  The spinach we got was very wilted, and the sauce was very bland. We paid way too much for what we got, $18 for a large (not XL). My wife's family owns a small pizza chain in NJ, so we know good pizza. We'll keep looking. I posted a picture, hopefully others looking for a good pizza will pass on this place. Don't be fooled like we were from the other reviews. We were hoping for a great local place, but this isn't it."}
{"text":"Jacks pizza was okay. I've had better, I've had worse. Although, you do get a lot for what you pay for. If I'm ever in the area again, I may return."}
{"text":"I used to manage a pizza business many years ago and made many hundreds of pizzas and eaten more than that. This \"meat lovers\" was such a disappointment it can barely be described. For $12 it could be in same category as $6 papa john/cici/frozen DiGiorno....for $20+ it's criminal. Look at picture, scarce and low quality meat. Walk in before ordering and you'll see it being rather gross and will change your mind. Best of luck"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. Fresh ingredients, authentic NY style big 20\" pies.  Will definitely go back.  Owner was very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"For what it is - A simple pizza parlor, you can't beat it. Great pizza, very friendly staff who remember return visitors and the best calzones around. Try a meatball calzone!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area! Great xauthentic nyc authentic food. taste...good service...friendly family owned"}
