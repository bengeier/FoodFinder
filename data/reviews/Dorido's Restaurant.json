{"text":"Now let me start off by saying, you cannot go wrong with the menu prices...Great food and great prices. The Grilled Reuben is delicious. Dorido's has the BEST fish sandwiches around. If you have to drive a little distance to get there, it is worth the trip. They feature a full bar with a nice rotation of beer selection. Some waitstaff issues, but I will add it was really crowded and they probably could have used another waitstaff member. Other than that, I do recommend that you visit. Very Clean. Please visit the ALLEGHENY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WEBSITE PUBLIC INFORMATION http://webapps.achd.net/Restaurant/RestaurantSearch.aspx FOR THIS AND ANY RESTAURANT YOU ARE THINKING OF DINING AT."}
{"text":"1st time @ Dorido's thought we would go check this place out. Friday appx.11:00am stopped for lunch and a beverage. Sat @ a table apparently the bartender takes care of. Was thrown menus and said what are you drinking. Had drinks back right now and said what do I want. So rushed for no good reason so I thought. He wanted to get back to watch freekin tiger woods or someone play golf. Our food we ordered was awesome would give it a 5 star but his rustiness  ruined the whole experience. He also never came back to ask how everything was or to get us another beverage who knows I was clearly out of. We will try again but don't sit at a high top."}
{"text":"We moved to the area in July. Shortly after we found Dorido's and have been back many times! The fish sandwich is hands down my favorite. The service in the dining room is excellent. The servers work as a team and are quick to check on you!!! Even if the parking lot is full it is worth stopping in because the kitchen and service are fast and fabulous and you never have to wait long!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes the food is pretty good and is cheap. WORST RUDEST bartenders I have ever seen. My husband and I went a couple times and they were such jerks we haven't been back! Seriously...they were very chummy with eachother but ignored customers and acted put out"}
{"text":"We have passed the place many times but never stopped because it is always packed. I see why. We were fortunate to be seated immediately. The staff was on the spot. Dinner choices, you will find something that is not just up your alley but delicious. There were four of us with diverse tastes and everyone was pleased. Their prices are competitive. The only knock is, I have limited mobility and there is not an easy way to negotiate parking or the dinning area. The handicapped spots are right on the road and the rest of the lot is on a slope. Inside is very tight also. That is the only reason i did not give it a five. I recommend off peak if you or someone with you has extra needs."}
{"text":"New to area.  Super fresh seafood. Had broiled seafood platter, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Good beer selection. We will definitely go back  soon!"}
{"text":"The worst. The food was okay. Just okay. The service was rude beyond belief. I guess you have to be a regular to get polite, professional service ... maybe. When we entered, the head waitress breezed by and said, 'sit anywhere.' No hello or good evening. After we seated ourselves, she dropped menus on our table: \"Here!\" They delivered my wife's dinner to someone else and vice-versa and when we pointed it out she made a huffy breath and acted annoyed with us (no 'sorry Ma'am') had the runner grab the dish from beneath someone else's nose and drop it on our table -- you don't do that in an actual professional restaurant. Later she called out across the dining room -- \"want another beer?\"  This woman who told us to sit anywhere acted beyond annoyed that she had to wait on us ... or anyone else. Hope she's annoyed by the justifiably crappy tip I left her: \"Here!\"   Amateur hour. Not going back, not ever."}
{"text":"Haha I gotta agree their fish sandwhich is legendary. I've been there 4 or 5 times and the service has always been very good. Believe it or not they do have other food here the burger I had the other day was delscious. Not overly crowded and a nice place to take the family. Great place with a good crowd and an awesome reputation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was a waste of money! My drink was not how I ordered it, the appetizer was cold, the fish and chips was over cooked and the service was terrible!   This dining experience was way below par from start to our abrupt finish. I ordered a martini with a twist and received one with three olives. Not only that, but while making the trip from the bar to the table the waiter  spilled half of it. The fried cauliflower appetizer was cold in the middle and arrive about 1 minute before our entrees. When the entrees were dropped, one was wrong and we didn't have silverware. I had to get up and find someone to bring silverware. The fish and chips was close to the worst I've ever had. When I had to track someone down for more water that was all I could really take of the whole experience.   I tried to talk with three people on our way out, but the two waiters didn't really care. They just said, \"sorry,\" and walked away. When I approached the bartender/ owner (I think) he had no idea how to handle a complaint in a professional manner.   I hear this place used to be great, but at this level of quality and service I don't see them in business for much longer."}
{"text":"Friendly and snappy service; it's a great place for lunch. The fish sandwich is great, although the big fish is basically just two fillets on one bun, so only order if you've got the room or if you're going to share (ask for an extra bun)."}
{"text":"Dorido's fish sandwiches are really good.  Havent eaten here now in some years but come to think of it a lot of the items on the menu were very good..  Great place for the family as dining is very casual and not expensive at all.  Wait staff is friendly and you typically leave full."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, I love their French onion soup. Hands down the best. I love French onion soup and have had it many places, and I compare them all to Dorido's.   their seafood is good, and prices aren't too bad either. A great place to relax with friends and watch the hockey game, or to gather for drinks.  One of my faves."}
{"text":"Had a pretty nice selection, got the 8 oz fried fish sandwich with fries and coleslaw, my god the sandwich was huge!!! There was a 16 oz option too, which shouldnt be an option because the 8 oz had me stuffed and i have a great appetite. Overall delicious, only four stars because our waitor was non existant after we got our food, luckily we were happy!"}
{"text":"I really like Dorido's restaurant! The food is great and atmosphere is cute! Their fish is amazing as well as their burgers! Their French onion soup is INCREDIBLE!! Best French onion soup I ever had! The most recent time I went our waiter was super funny and nice. The first time I went the one guy was very standoffish and not friendly. Doesn't take away from how great the food is though!"}
{"text":"I agree that Dorido's is a classic old-school joint, but 4.5 stars?  I've been here a bunch of times over the years and if nothing else it's impossible to argue with the prices. If Dorido's ever offered a Groupon or BuyWithMe, they'd have to just give away the food because it can't get much cheaper.    I also agree with the praise for the fish sandwich, very tasty, not \"instant-death\" greasy, and a sizable portion.  So the three stars then...the last time we went, we got a weird hostile vibe from the bar staff.  All we wanted were a couple of beers to go with the round of Golden Tee.  I'm sorry that we aren't regulars.  The fact is this is perfect for spot for a low-key lunch or dinner after 18 at the S.P. Golf Course.  Perhaps our experience was an anomaly.  I'd certainly be back the next time we play a round at the course, as it is undoubtedly superior to the snack bar."}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  It has a great selection on the menu.  The food is good and is a decent price."}
{"text":"If I'm ever near South Park or I have even made the 45 minute drive to eat here. It is worth it! I have never had anything bad here. Everything from the crab cakes, wings, salads, soups, and sandwiches have been fresh and hot. The service is always great and with a smile. I casual place with plenty of TVs is you want to watch sports there. I highly recommend it and take my family there when we have a chance."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips.  Service was prompt, but not exactly super friendly.  Kind of a dive of a diner."}
{"text":"Nice parking lot. Comfortable seating at the bar. Food was delicious and fast. Nice bright and clean environment. Top notch service. The cocktails were great."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is hit or miss.  Seems like when it is busy, they are on it.  When it's not busy, the service is slow and seemed a bit rude by one of the bartenders.  We sat with dirty dishes for at least 15 minutes AFTER we asked for a box.  Instead of tending to our table, the bartender started washing glasses and chatting with the guests at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here with some family and was told it was a fish/ seafood place. I was disappointed in the selection really it's a fish sandwich type of place. I believe they only had cod.  I had a fish sandwich that I would expect at Denny's or something equivalent. It wasn't bad just all around average. My girlfriend had fish plater and it was slightly better but shrimp was way over cooked, her scallops where a nice size though.  The bathroom smelled as though it never was cleaned. Service was generally so so the waiter could have been much more friendly. It was only modestly busy but they were slow for service.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I have been to Dorido's several times. Its not a frequent spot I hit up because it is about 40 minutes from my house. The restaurant is seat yourself. We typically go to the second level away from the bar (not that there is anything wrong with the bar).  I typically order a fish sandwich when I come, and yes, that is what I ordered today. It is fried and oh so good. I also got a cup of clam chowder soup. No complaints there. I tried a bite of my nephews grilled cheese and was impressed how tasty it was.  The restaurant is fair in price. You get a decent amount of food for not a ton of money. The server brings the check to your table but you actually go up to the bar to pay.  There is a private lot with plenty of spots.  I have only ever gone during lunch hours but the business is always booming. I will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite local place to go. Food is slightly above average. Fried fish is always a good go to item. Excellent beer selection with seasonal rotation. Medium sized bar always packed with locals. Serving staff is very friendly and will treat you like a long time friend. Two flat screen tvs for pittsburgh sports and the occasional YouTube jukebox night. Overall great place to grab a bite and a beer in a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are ever jonesing for a good fried fish sandwich or some good chili ....GO HERE .....I have never had anything bad here and would gladly go here when given a chance"}
{"text":"Have been very satisified with my meals at Doridos till last night.  Husband wanted the Ribs so I decided on the Prime Rib which I have always wanted to try.  I am not sure what I was served but it was NOT Prime Rib.  I was never asked how I wanted it (Ex. Medium rare) and when I got it it was burnt, was not pink like it should be and like I was eating shoe leather.  Also extremely fatty.  I got maybe 6 bites out of the entire steak and the rest was ALL FAT.  I will not be ordering the prime rib again for sure but maybe will go back for their other items."}
{"text":"It's casual...think Kings with a bar and some marine decor. The fried food is delicious. Kids and I like their fried clams and shrimp."}
{"text":"I have no clue why this place has a 4 star rating, other than the cheap prices! Average wings, over cooked cheese sticks with the cheese leaking out everywhere. Overcooked clams and worst of all the pre made burger pattie was horrible, no taste, stale bun too.  If this isn't enough, the bartender, who was also serving food spit into some napkins behind the bar!! Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local place. Casual and inexpensive. It gets packed during the Lent season because of the great fried fish sandwiches. The service is quick and accommodating of large parties (6- 10)"}
{"text":"I've had many friends tell me to try here if looking for a seafood joint. Now some friends think way differently when saying joint but that's another blog.  This place is smaller but adequate which I hear often from the wife. Haa. The broiled fish sandwich was delicious even though I passed on the bun. Trust me I have enough buns on me. The wife had fried fish sammich and I stole a sliver. It too was very good as was the calamari appetizer which comes in 3 sizes and we ordered a medium which was plenty for 4 of us.  The kiddos had a steak sandwich which she only ate maybe half of and the other rug rat had the fish sticks and he said they were really really really good. You can order the meal which throws in some fries and Cole slaw.  I'm looking forward to trying their dinners here and having a drink from the bar which you have to walk through to the dining room. The wait staff were exceptionally funny and courteous. This place is worth a visit and every penny."}
{"text":"When in town visiting my farther, we'll stop in for lunch. This year was disappointing our server (male) no personality,didn't say hi how we were doing. Guess I'm used to Southern Hospitality living  there for 30yrs. He mentioned the specials and took drink orders. I aways get the fish sandwich always good till this year taste? bland. Compared to Penn Brewery fish sandwich in  Troy Hill neighborhood ,Doridos is a D I S T A N C E 2nd."}
{"text":"Last to leave the bar! Went for drinks for my birthday, and ended up getting food just before the kitchen closed. The fish sandwich was perfect, and big!! We also got the chicken tenders, and they were good too. The drinks were great, got introduced to a Long Beach tea. New favorite drink! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Dorido's is a place that looks like it has been around for the last 40 years.  It has the classic old school seafood restaurant.  It is seafood, hearty oily and often fried.  All the classics like fish and chips, scampi, and broiled fish.  Sides of coleslaw, fries or vegetable of the day."}
{"text":"It's okay. The staff was really friendly and treated my kids well.   I chose the fish sandwich, which is well represented in the reviews. It's was just okay. It was two whole fried fish fillets on a cold hoagie role. No lettuce, no tomato, nothing but dry bread. Yes, they served tartar and cocktail sauces on the side. The fish itself was decent, but it makes for a weird, pretty bland sandwich, even after I slathered it with sauces.   My families dishes were equally \"meh.\""}
{"text":"I cannot believe everyone in the world doesn't know about this restaurant. The food is amazing and as important, the service is some of the best I've ever had. Scallops are my fave, open face prime rib is a close second. They bring the food out so fast it's unreal and everything is  sooooo fresh. I have lived in pittsburgh for 20 years and never knew about this until I moved to pleasant hills. Please people, if you want an awesome experience food / service & atmosphere ... try it! I'm just a customer and have no affiliation with this place whatsoever ... I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great food but service was spotty at best. Had to go looking for our server to get drink refills, dessert and to pay our tab."}
{"text":"Crab cake sandwich one of the best things on any menu, anywhere. Clean. Reasonably priced. They set the bar for the area."}
{"text":"Beyond appalled by this business.  Took my 94-year-old disabled mother-in-law there today and they do not have seating for the disabled to their dining room.  They told us to take her up a set of stairs (in her chair) or we could walk around to the back and carry her down the stairs. This is this solution?  If they were remotely sensitive to the situation I would have been much more understanding but they were sincerely unapologetic."}
{"text":"I stop by this place often. It has some good all around beer n drink choices. The food is very home style. For the Quality of food and the price you pay it's one of the better spots in this area. The service always seems to be quick once you get yourself seated. Don't pass up on the soups."}
{"text":"Tonight was probably our last visit until lent for their great fish sandwiches. So I gave 3 stars for that & also great prices with a good menu variety. You have your basic bar foods & some good seafood entrees. Our friend really wanted shrimp- got 'em & loved'em. My husband got the sweet potato fries which he strongly disliked bc they're cut very thick & tasted \"off\". I had wings that are the typical size nowadays, with good classic buffalo sauce.  Now the bad- out of last four visits (including tonight), over the past year. Our service was awful. Every waitress we have is ABSOLUTELY miserable and rude. The waiters were great, but it must be bad to work there as a woman! I didn't bother mentioning bc I felt uncomfortable & wanted to leave, as we feel like an inconvenience when we are there."}
{"text":"Recently, we were in need of a quick meal and everywhere we tried to go seemed to have a long wait. Hey hubs, \"Remember that place by South Park that we occasionally pass? I think there is a fish on the sign. Wanna try it out?\" When we arrived, there were a couple of people in front of us but we got a table within 5 minutes.  Looking over the menu, my first impression was to get up and run out the front door. The selection was huge and the prices were very small. $4 for s burger? That's scary low. Despite their many specials, I went with the zucchini fries for an app (not to be confused with the zucchini planks). And a steak salad for my entree. Hubs got a sandwhich and we ordered fish sticks for our toddler. The kids meal and app came out quickly which is always appreciated. The zucchini fries were tasty but not served with sauce. We requested marinara and were quickly pleased. Also a big hit with the kiddo. His fish sticks were more like planks, think Long John Silvers, that size. Two in a meal with fries. My entree, steak salad, was also done fairly well. Although it was obviously an iceberg mix, the salad was also topped with some extra veggies even a pepper and an olive. Hubs enjoyed his sandwhich. Overall, Dorido's seems to be a step above your typical bar food or a family style restaurant like King's or Eat N Park. The prices are scary low and the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to sit down and eat that is fairly better than an Eat N Park or Denny's. Nothing there is really really good, but nothing is really bad either. Service is a hit or miss, one time during a Pirates (yes I know) baseball game all the waiters and cooks were standing watching the game and not noticing that all 3 of our drinks needed refills for about 15 minutes. Same with the bill asked for the bill waiter started watching the game again about 15 minutes for check. Overall not a bad place to eat just don't be in a rush! There are better places to eat that are within 5-10 miles"}
{"text":"Great food ... great prices ... and for a bar, great desserts as well. In addition to the fish, the open face prime rib is the best you will find.  Quirky but good service."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves the fish sandwich, but you have to try the broiled fish! It is broiled perfectly, the nice thing about this joint is, it knows what it is and doesn't try to do anything else, the seafood is great the price is awesome and the service is quick."}
{"text":"The fish is very good but you must try the Reuben Sandwich.  Magnifique!    Good service in a nice, clean establishment   Consistently good.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Fish was good. Other food average. Prices decent. Waiter was not very friendly.  Did not bring something I asked for. Never stopped back to check on us."}
{"text":"Love this place. Restaurant is neatly decorated and well maintained. Whole place seemed very clean and not dusty! Which was a surprise because of how many fish and other decorations they have on the wall. The food was excellent every time and the servers were very friendly and helpful.  *last visit the guy was a total ass for no reason. Terrible service, I was treated like I was a real nuisance for wanting to order food for lunch. Haven't been back in many months."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent prices!  The broiled crab cakes & stuffed shrimp were awesome (and I'm very picky about my crab cakes!!!)  No filler, all lump!"}
{"text":"I was brought to Doridos on Halloween night after trick-or -treating ended, around 8:30pm. My boyfriend and I grabbed the last two seats at the bar, it was pretty crowded with all of the tables in the bar room area taken as well. I also noticed they have a back dining room that began to fill up shortly after we arrived. We were acknowledged quickly by the bartender Aimee. We ordered 2 beers, a dogfish head 60 min IPA for me and a Yuengling for the beau. A different server/bartender took our order when we were ready. I chose the crab cake sandwich which normally comes with fries and coleslaw. I asked if I could substitute a cup of the shrimp and sausage gumbo, which was their soup of the day, for the fries and slaw. She looked at me puzzled and at first responded, \"it normally comes with fries and slaw;we normally don't substitute soup.\" I noticed it was a handwritten check so really she could substitute whatever she wants since she was not limited by the computer system. She must have realized the same and said, \"ok, I'll just say no sides, sub soup.\" (obviously!). I was glad I made that substitution. The gumbo was delicious! Lots of shrimp and sausage with just the right amount of kick to it. The crabcake sandwich was also delicious-all meat and very little filler. And for $8.99 the price could not be beat. I was skeptical due to the price but I was very satisfied with my choice. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and scallops meal, with fried shrimp. The shrimp looked tasty, however, he split a scallop with me and I was very underwhelmed with it. It was rather rubbery and flavorless. It appeared to be prepared in just butter, very plain. His also came with coleslaw and fries. They have a very seafood-centric menu but also have a variety of other options as well including burgers,sandwiches, the typical fried food bar apps. They also always have daily specials and daily soup specials. I'd visit Dorido's again-everything I personally ordered was tasty and priced right plus they had a wide variety of craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Food OK service good but they stand outside at front door and smoke. Ruin your experience  before you come in establishment. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Coordinates for restaurant are wrong.yelp would not let me check in"}
{"text":"Doridos is awesome for their fish. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish is a real generous size and the fries were wonderful. All hot and that's what I want when I order fish and fries. Their service is fast, you don't have to wait long for your food. My son ordered their grilled cheese and that was actually really good too. You never know what you're going to get when ordering a child's grilled cheese sandwich. The seating area is not huge but they can fit a good amount of people in there. There is the bar section then a few steps up tables and chairs."}
{"text":"EDIT - I upped this to 4 stars, should be 4.5, compared to every local and non chain place the food and prices here are hands down the best.  The following is an honest review I had written early, but despite my one time bad experience with service, go there.  Dorido's restaurant has been around for fifty years. I like the food there, I really do. I have seen in some reviews patrons didn't like the burger, but I do.  I get take out a lot. If this review was based solely on the food, it would have a 4.5 - 5-star rating, but this review is based on my dining experience.  It's lent. I get it. And I wanted a good meal that I knew was consistent. So where else better to go for fish than Dorido's. After feeding the grandkids a four o'clock supper, at 8:15, I toted them, along with my daughter for Dorido's. I knew it was going to be busy, It was Friday and it was Lent. So we went late.  We didn't have long to wait for a table, maybe 10 minutes. The host was friendly, but the place was packed.  After being seated, a younger, goatee waiter walked by the table, exclaiming, \"Jesus!\", somehow I don't think he was praying.  We had the singing waitress, seriously, she sings all the time. She is exceptionally friendly and upbeat and good. She took our app order, drink order, then food order. The stuffed mushrooms came out after 8 minutes, and the food, although the kids swore it took forever, really came out fast.  Everything was delicious. I especially liked the Ranch dressing, it was housemade. I can't complain about any of the food and the portions were plenty.  Again, singing waitress was great ... until she brought out our food and that was it. This seems to be a pattern, no matter who is our server when we go. They bring the food and I don't see them again. We didn't see her again. Wait, I'm lying. She walked by and I asked for more tarter sauce. she got it. That was it. At that point, I believe they moved her elsewhere and we became a community wait staff table. whoever could get to us would. Noone refreshed our drinks, no one asked if we needed anything else, nothing. We finished our meals and it took fifteen minutes to flag down a server for take out containers, then another 8  minutes to get the check from a totally different server.My daughter had to take the kids outside, they were getting restless, plus we felt uncomfortable because people at the bar were making comments about the kids. And my grandkids were very well behaved.  I thought this was a family place? It wasn't our fault that it was after ten. We would have been out of there by 9:40, before the chatter about the kids, had someone come over to check on us,  I will say this ... five people a bill of 58.00. You can't beat that.  I'll go back, simply because the food is good and the price is right. If I sit inside, I'll go when it's less busy."}
{"text":"My daughter loved the popcorn shrimp so much, she ordered seconds! Waitstaff very nice. We'll come back!"}
{"text":"I was here to have a few. Wasn't planning on eating or anything. Honestly you better get a table of you want service if you aren't regular customer at this place. Wasn't very happy with service."}
{"text":"An excellent place to stop after a round at the South Park golf course, or anytime you're in the mood for terrific food and great service! Good menu selections and daily specials, and the food hasn't disappointed yet! Super attentive wait staff - Bob and Jessie just could not be nicer or more pleasant everytime! - and the folks that frequent Dorado's always have smiles on their faces, cause it's just that good! Worth a stop anytime...go out of your way for this place!"}
{"text":"For nearly a half-century, the ever-popular, Dorido's has been serving up grub to the fine folks of South Park Township and the surrounding areas with a hearty pat on the back and a firm handshake. Yet it wasn't until last year that I was made aware of their existence via a hot tip from my father who swears by their tasty fare, which he and a longtime pal of his consider a regular treat after a day of biking in the area.   However, it was Good Friday, and considering that a swordfish is mounted below their writ-large logo, this lapsed Catholic wasn't about to go heathen on yinz.   No, this cozy, cabin-like bar and grill specializes in seafood, oddly enough. One can have Lobster Pots as well as walleye, catfish, and salmon prepared in different ways, but gosh darn it if i wasn't hankering for crabcakes.   I believe I had mine broiled (they can also be fried) and found that the duo of patties were full of luscious, jumbo lump crabmeat and contained little filler. Tartar sauce accompanied the cakes, but a cookbook-perfect remoulade was hidden underneath both, so I barely touched it and the cocktail sauce. Hey, when it comes to crabcakes, it's mother sauces all the way or the highway for me, bub.   Two sides came with my entree, and neither of them disappointed. The baked potato was steamy and colossal while the cole slaw had that tangy/creamy/crunchy alchemy pretty much on lock.   Kay and I shared some fried oysters, and the love affair with the breaded fryolator mollusks was reignited. The coating was applied just enough to jacket each briny ocean blob without turning it into a savory donut, that hot seawater running down my throat as I cracked them open with my teeth, one by one.   The service was on-point, and the clientele were as friendly as they were lively. As I alluded to earlier, and as evidenced by a couple of drive-bys, Dorido's is never lacking in commerce (the parking lot is almost full...always! We barely got a spot ourselves!), so there was a ten-minute wait for a booth.   A sneaky octogenarian tried to steal it from us only to reveal that he was kidding. \"Hey, but let me eat with yinz anyway,\" he said. \"C'mon. I 'aint got much time left! I'll be dead before I get seated!\"  Then a middle-aged couple we struck up a conversation with while in line asked if we wanted to eat with them. They were left with two extra seats at their table due to another couple no-showing.   Where else but in Pittsburgh do people want to dine with complete strangers? We'd never been there before yet were made to feel welcome regardless. It was as if we were lifelong customers.  \"When are ya buying a house out this way?\" we were asked.   Speaking of that line, once we paid our tab and departed, we noticed that it was snaking out into the parking lot and around the back of the building.   Dorido's isn't goin' belly up  anytime in the near future. Lordy, is this joint boomin'. Somethin' sure is shakin' in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch Thursday 12/1 and ate at the bar. The service was top notch and the food was delicious.   We started out with the fried clams appetizer which was pretty decent for not being a dedicated fish place.  My buddy ordered the fish sandwich and he enjoyed it. He couldn't finish his meal and got a takeaway box, but wound up forgetting it. He was kicking himself about it for the rest of the day.   I ordered one of the four specials for the day - the chicken parmesan sandwich, but asked for banana peppers. We were going to go to the Elrama Tavern for lunch, but he suggested Dorido's instead. I love the same sandwich from ET and had it on the brain, so I figured I'd satisfy that craving. It worked.   There were four or five soups on the specials board, which appeals to me greatly. However, I was afraid the Maryland crab soup wouldn't pair well with my chicken sandwich, so I balked on ordering it.  South Park is a little out of they way from my house in Canonsburg, but somewhat closer to Monongaltuckey where my buddy lives. I would make the trip to check this place out again, though.  I initially marked this place four out of five stars, but I couldn't think of a reason why it shouldn't get five. Great service, tasty food, and decent prices. Five stars."}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich in tahn.  Crab soup is Great! Really amazing value.  Ate here twice this week."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and their food. The people are always very, very nice. The French onion soup is literally to die for. The place is small but mighty and the bar is pretty big. Go here, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly atmosphere that is perfect for a family   with small children. Food is excellent for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I used to live in South Park I would often walk over here to get their fish sandwiches to take home with me. Doritos is a full service restaurant and bar. Place usually gets packed.  While they are known for seafood they have hamburgers, salads, and other offerings on their menu. Service is friendly and food is served promptly. On this particular visit I wanted to try their fish and chips. The fish they serve come in generous portions. If you order it fried you probably will end up taking some of it home with you.   Since fried foods normally don't agree with me I asked if I could have it baked. My waiter was also kind enough to offer me a substitute baked potato instead of the fries for the same reason. The fish comes with both tartar and cocktail sauces. Along with it I got the both baked potato and Cole slaw. The entire meal was just under $10.00. Food was very good and I enjoyed all of it.  They have booth seating in the front and if you head towards the back up a short flight of stairs there is table seating. In the middle is the bar area. You normally pay at the bar but on this occasion they brought the check to me. Often overlooked, Dorido's is located on Brownsville Road in South Park near the golf course and across from a small group of shops across the street.  They are now serving Lenten specials which include pierogies and haluska for under $5.00. They also have fresh seafood listed along with their daily specials.  Will definitely return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by this place for years and we kept saying we need to stop there!  We finally made it and we weren't disappointed! First off the staff was extremely friendly and personable and suggested items for us. Get the broiled seafood platter! Amazing!!! We will definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I was heartbroken that Butya's closed, so friends turned me on to this old place. Maybe not as old as Butya's but it's been around long enough for Burghers to pass judgement. Excellent fish sandwich, good variety of craft beers on tap and waitress with just enough attitude! They had a small fish sandwich and a large, which is exactly twice as big. I could barely finish the small. Nice crispy batter on fresh white cod on a French roll. Nice choice of sides, besides the usual fries and slaw. It's a winner."}
{"text":"It's ok!  That's about it! And if you have someone that is handicapped and in a wheelchair, keep driving.  I wouldn't consider this place to be handicapped accessible.  You are lucky to get one person in restroom let alone and wheelchair.  Steps to access the upper part of dining room.  So yeah, really not accessible.    Now to the food, if you enjoy fish sandwiches, it's ok.  I personally think over the years, the quality has gone downhill considerably.  Everything on menu is fried so if you enjoy bar food, fried in the oldest grease possible, this is your place.     Now the grossest thing ever, I've watched a bartender spit into napkins, not wash hands, then serve food.  I've also watched at the bar, an employee take snuff out of his mouth and lift the top lid of a burger, and place the snuff on the burger of another employee.  Nice going, you jagoff!"}
{"text":"Two friends and I went to Dorido's for a couple drinks and a bite to eat.  We have been here a couple times and enjoy the wine prices, so we were lookin forward to it.  We only had 1-2 drinks per person.  However, we ended up being there for 2.5 hours!  No one came to check up on us and we were consistently ignored by most of the staff.  After finishing my last drink, it was an HOUR before someone came to see if we were finished.  We did not have a designated server, and a particular waitress would look right at us and walk past.  I am a patient person and do not usually like to say negative things about a place...but this was horrible.  The fact that we were largely ignored for almost three hours is not okay.  I am usually a generous tipper, but this was too much even for me."}
{"text":"great food but service staff is a \"pack of rude males\"....... what a shame! we will not go back."}
{"text":"Scott and his staff will take great care of you. You'll have a hard time deciding what beer and what catch of the day you'll want. There's soup, sandwiches, salads and dessert to go along with all the seafood. I hear the meatloaf is \"out of this world.\" No one goes away hungry or disappointed. Believe me. Great place for dinner."}
{"text":"The fish. You go here for the FISH. Anyday, anytime, go here for the fish sandwhiches. Grab a Yeungling, order up a large fish with fries, and enjoy the locals. This is really the best fish sandwhich around, and it's at the edge of South Park so maybe head over for a nice day of cycling, walking, golfing, etc... then stop in here for a great lunch.  They also do a great take out if you want to enjoy it at home or in the park."}
