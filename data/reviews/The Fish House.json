{"text":"Tiny portions for the price you pay...better off going to Red Lobster or The Keg....Took my whole family to celebrate my wife's birthday. when our food arrived we were shocked. All the portions are tiny. I ordered rainbow trout with sweet mashed potato and Asparagus.. Fish was tiny 2 1/2 \" x 4\" and may be 3 millimeter thin. Sweet potato were may be 2 table spoon and 3 spears of asparagus. My wife and my kids potions were equally small. I will never go again..."}
{"text":"3/5. Great oysters and fish tacos. Baja shrimps are okay- the sauce tastes like one out of a PC bottle. Recommend any of the fresh fish selection"}
{"text":"Dropped in for Savour York promotion. The menu had a good selection to choose from. I had the pistachio crusted salmon with scallop potatoes...the salmon was cooked perfect and the scallop potatoes were excellent. My guest had lobster & Papardelle  pasta in a saffron lobster cream sauce which had a half tail and chunks of lobster folded into the pasta...very good value. The New Orleans bread pudding came to the table warm with a bourbon sauce..a nice finish to our meal. Service was friendly and attentive. Going to make reservations for my birthday"}
{"text":"Went to the Shucker's portion of the Fish House for their Happy Hour special (where items would be 30-40% off). We heard that the restaurant wasn't very big, so we had called ahead. Apparently they didn't take reservations but were willing to put our names down, which was really nice of them.   Our server sat us at a big booth with lots of room for our party of four. She was pleasant and friendly (but not overly so). Got us bread, watered us quickly and gave us room to think about what we were going to get. Bread was cold but the butter was really creamy so it spread well.  What we ate by order of preference   1. Classic Bacon-Wrapped Sea Scallops  - very nicely done - i'm not usually a scallops fan but i would order this again. Bacon wasn't too greasy, scallops were cooked just right.  2. Lobster quesadillas - it was yummy; lots of cheese. it also came with mango salsa (which was surprisingly sweet)  3. Muscargot - lots of cheese - served in an escargot plate. Each hole had a small piece of mussel and some mushrooms   4. Cajun Alligator - ordered it to try something different (but it ended up tasting like fried chicken bits)  5. Escargot - escargot wasn't bad, but wasn't stellar either  6. Crab cakes - i wouldn't get this - the texture was strange and i didn't like the taste.   this is a great place for hanging out with friends after work - the food was filling and the price was pretty good for the variety of food we had. Would definitely come here again (maybe try Fish House or other food in Shucker's)"}
{"text":"Didn't come here for a long time.  Indeed it's a Fish House.  The moment that I step into the restaurant I can smell the fish.  Haha is it good or bad?  But surprisingly at lunch the restaurant is almost full.    The Fish Chowder is a bit salty with more corn starch.  The crab cake is 2 small pieces taste good but not much crab in it.  The Tuna Taco though is very good. The mix of greens and the sauce makes it delightful for a lunch.   The server is very friendly and far away but reachable.  He always has smiles on his face.  I can feel that he enjoys his job here."}
{"text":"My friend, in her desire to bust my lobster cherry (I know, I know!), took me to the Fish House. Kind of a lame name, but I pushed on.  The restaurant makes no attempt to hide that it's a seafood restaurant. Fish...everywhere! At first, the fish smell was pretty strong upon entry, which turned me off a little. Luckily, the smell was long gone by the time we got to where we were seated.  The prices are very reasonable, the server was very friendly, and the dining area was definitely a lot nicer than what I was expecting. I ordered the angel hair pasta, with lobster, shrimp, and scallops.  The bowl was huge, and very appealing. The food itself was downright delicious, and I could definitely see why lobster is held in such high regard. Despite my best efforts, I could only finish just over half of it. No matter, it was just as delicious reheated for lunch the next day!  Well done, Fish House. Now you guys just have to work on changing your name to something that doesn't resemble an insult one would hurl at a lousy strip joint."}
{"text":"First off, walking in and waiting to be seated by the lobster tank was not appetizing. The tank was overcrowded with lobsters - the ones at the bottom of the tank was not moving. I was appalled at how they treat their seafood. Secondly, the restaurant reeked of pungent (fish) smell.   We had: crab cakes, plate of oysters, fried coconut shrimps, surf and turf (lobster and steak), bottle of wine and more lobsters!   The lobster did not taste fresh. The tail was not flavorful and moist. We had steamed lobster. The tail had a different taste similar to the pungent dead fish smell. It was not attractive too. We brought our family from another country here to try seafood and they did not enjoyed at all."}
{"text":"Don't think I'll come back again.  Service was great, but the food..... I'll have to say the seafood were drier than my skin!  And I'm only giving them 2 star for the service and their okay dessert."}
{"text":"Great place for good quality seafood at a reasonable price. Large selection of fish, made how you want. Platters allow you to get an assortment of seafood (fish, shrimps, scallops, lobster, etc.) They also serve pasta and chicken should you so desire or if someone in your group isn't a huge seafood fan.. but it's a great place just to have seafood that is cooked just right, not overdone so it's tough or dry."}
{"text":"Went to the Fish House today for lunch. I ordered the Bouillabaisse in an attempt to eat somewhat healthy during the slew of holiday eating fiascos. It was huge and could probably feed 2. It also came with a side of bread for dipping into the soup. Came with some sort of white fish, about 20 mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. Scallops were cooked just right. Very tender and moist. The fish and shrimp were overcooked and dry. Calamari was stringy at times. My DC had fish and chips with sweet potato fries and it looked amazing!   The service was awesome. Server was attentive and checked up on us from time to time. I opted not to have dessert but my DC had the Creme Brûlée which I snuck a bite of and it was tasty. I opted for a cappuccino and it was hot and tasty! Will come back again and try their halibut and chips!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Fish House four times, each time for their Savour York Region specials. I would rate the first three visits as 3.5/5, but today's lunch was quite disappointing. The quality of the food on the Savour York Region menu has gone down from last spring.    I had the Blue Crab Corn Chowder, Seafood Jambalaya and New Orleans Bread Pudding. My mother had the same appetizer and dessert, but had the \"Bang Bang Shrimp\" as her main course.   The chowder was good, better than canned chowder, but nothing amazing. The jambalaya (\"shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, Andoullie sausage, chicken, tomato, onion, green pepper and jade rice\") was okay, not great. The mussels (approx. five) in the jambalaya were a little undercooked but not to the point that would make me sick. There were only three thin slices of sausage but quite a bit of chicken. There wasn't enough flavour in the jambalaya, similar to the muted taste of a box of frozen Stouffer's pasta.   The Bang Bang Shrimp (\"jumbo shrimp tossed in bang bang sauce and served with steamed broccoli and sticky rice\") looked like a stack of shrimp with a side of diet food. The shrimp was tasty and crispy (seemed deep fried) and drenched in lots of pale orange sauce that tasted a lot like Big Mac Sauce from McDonald's. The steamed broccoli was just that - plain steamed broccoli. Okay, well I'm sure that'll be complimented by some flavourful sticky rice, right? Nope! The rice was nothing but regular white rice that I could have steamed in my rice cooker at home. When we asked the waiter where the sticky rice was, he pointed at the white mound on the plate and called it \"sticky steamed rice\". Maybe my Asian background is what makes me expect sticky rice to be sticky (glutinous rice), but it wasn't at all sticky.   The New Orleans Bread Pudding (\"with Bourbon Sauce\") was mostly bread crust. The sauce was good, as were the inner parts of the bread, but there was just way too much crust for my liking. It's too bad that this is their only dessert on the Savour York Region menu this time around, because their previous dessert selections were quite good.   In terms of service, our waiter was polite and adequately attentive, asking us how each course of our meal was a few minutes after serving and refilling our drinks. The atmosphere of the restaurant (weekday lunch) was quiet as usual - I can only wonder how dead the place is when Savour York Region isn't in effect (I won't be back to find out unless they make big changes to their menu). The restaurant seemed clean as usual on the surface, though there were some big cobwebs on the ceiling/wall above our table.  If you want similar seafood that looks and tastes a LOT better, skip this place and just go to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Western.   Seafood.   Restaurant.   Markham. Where Le Biftheque Steak House used to happen. It was a popular Steak House in its prime.  In its stead looks/feels like run-of-the-mill Seafood joint. The Sea-theme ornaments, Fish logo, whole-9-yards.   2.5'd Now confirmed.  Can't mistake this for Steak House, no way.  All about Competitive Intelligence to it's survival. 1  -  No dedicated Seafood resto within vicinity. 2  -  No dedicated Seafood resto within vicinity without being Chinese.  Happy Hours(4 pm - 10 pm weekdays & 4 pm - 6 pm weekends) Turns the Regular(Frown) Pricing to a more Happier(Hour) Pricing. Food turns out to be mostly on-par to average expectations. Order the hard-to-mess-up Food and you'll be Clear-SAILING."}
{"text":"This restaurant moved from Sheppard Ave couple of years back where it used to have a great bar. New location bar ok but food excellent as before. Had not been for number of years. Owner gave me free glass of wine for being loyal customer.  Excellent long standing reputation for fresh fish  Try the Pickerel....divine. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Fish House for a lunch and I'd say this place is a 3-star restaurant at best. The setup looks a lot like a dated, emptier Red Lobster. The waitstaff is both, courteous and professional.   Based on the appearance, I would avoid this place unless you want somewhere casual with a dependable and steady menu selection. The tables are worn and the interior is slightly dated. It's a decent option for a 'steak and potatoes' type of person.   The starter sour-dough rolls are just not that great. I usually get one of the fresh fish(6 oz) with a side, usually roasted beets or grilled vegetables. The fish is uninspired, and a bit bland. Personally, if I wanted seafood I would either opt for an ethnic-inspired restaurant or a restaurant with a modern twist.   It's not bad for a non-chain restaurant, but comparable to The Keg or Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Fish was decent - had arctic char, and also tried chilean sea bass. Hard to get that wrong. However crab cakes definitely were horrible, small, too much filler' ' not even hot."}
{"text":"I would be giving this place 5 stars if I had only went once but when I went the second time I was a little miffed. First time the food came hot DELICIOUS and in massive heaping portions. Second time the food was less, and not as hot in terms of taste or temperature. Still a yummy, cute place with a MASSIVE menu. Key lime pie = crazy yummy."}
{"text":"Celebrated Gavin's birthday Saturday at the Fish House. We had a great time, as always. I cannot complain about the entrees. They are great."}
{"text":"I should expand on my review, since I made this a long time ago, on my really old (think Samsung Galaxy S2) smartphone, when I was fuming mad, because I was sitting with my family with nothing on the menu that was safe for me and my peanut-allergic self to eat. It was the most miserable family gathering I'd ever attended, and I wanted to leave every minute I was there.  I would give this a zero but there's no option to do so. Not only are they completely intolerant to allergies or sensitivities, they just tell you to \"not order\" items. Rude and incompetent. Better off going to a fast food joint. McDonalds comes to mind!  The reason I mention \"McDonalds\" is because the fish they serve is: 1) really greasy (it's fish, why is it oily and greasy?), 2) loaded with seasoning and spices (I get a little bit, but this was an insane amount - more than I would put on even bad-tasting food), and 3) overpriced, with not a lot of variety. From what I can recall (terrible overall memory, great specific memory), they had Haddock, Cod, Tilapia, and two others I can't remember, but that was about it. I remember my family wanted to try it because they had great reviews, but it was only after we'd gotten there that we realized the Red Lobster down the street was, indeed, a better seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is fresh and delicious. Another thing is that the food is consistently good and pleasing. Everything that I have tried in the past was amazing. It is a little pricey but worth it if you have celebration or an occasion to go out.  I usually end up getting the 9oz Costa Rican Tilapia with the Sweet Pepper Mash and the Chefs Daily Vegetables.  As for Appetizers, you don't want to miss the Panko Crusted Grouper Fingers."}
{"text":"The Fish House in Markham was an excellent choice for a quick lunch. The tilapia with lemon basil seasoning was not only light and savourful but tangy as well. My side orders; Namely an extremely-buttery and creamy dollop of mashed potatoes and an oxymoronic, incongruous plate of \"buffet bar\" salad. Service was very good as expected."}
{"text":"First off I'll say I am not a big fan of seafood but they seem to have a nice selection. I tried the coconut shrimp in Thai sauce and thought it was very good. The battered halibut is a little on the small side but it tasted very good as well."}
{"text":"A \"Markham\" version of the Fish Market chain of restaurants out of California.  Menu built very similarly, decor and ambience not as nice though.  Food was okay- good price for raw oysters, tasty bacon-wrapped scallops, draught Guinness quite pricey.  Barmistress was on top of things- she more-or-less looked after the bar and the whole area surrounding singlehandedly, also dealing with the weird regular bar patrons.  Probably about 20-30 people, some at the bar, some in booths.  Never missed a beat.  Kudos to her."}
{"text":"This review is based on Happy Hour at The Fish House where their appetitizers are on specials.  The wait staffs here are awesome: attentive, friendly and professional. We had great services while sitting at the bar area.  Food wise was kind of meh, if I would had pay full prices for them, The Fish House would be a 2 star.  Ordered:  Crab Cakes ($6.99) Mussels ($5.99) Escargot ($3.99) Scallops Wrapped in Bacon ($5.99) Grouper Fingers ($4.49)  Nothing wow me enough to be excited and want to come back for more....  May come back for Happy Hour for a drink and snack, but definitely not coming and pay full prices for those!!"}
{"text":"I ate here in 2009 and was not disappointed.  I had the Bouillabaisse, it was steamy hot and with an abundance of seafood.  My only criticism was there was that there was too much salmon to ratio of the other seafood .  Others were pleased with their dishes like the seafood risotto. I returned with friends again in  late 2010 and ordered the Bouillabaisse and was sadly disappointed.  It was not steamy hot, rather lukewarm  and the portion was much smaller.  Everyone felt their dish was lacking.  Im curious what its like now but Im afraid it has gone down hill"}
