{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out and we finally did. Super friendly staff. Cute little place and clean. The food is amazing!! I got the chicken gyro and greek salad, chicken was grilled perfectly, the taziki sauce was great and the greek salad was amazing the dressing was exactly how I like it. Yummm can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"this place is a staple. its real no frills gyros are the best. Im from nyc originally and this is what i want when i think gyro. other places are popping up across the valley, but so far georges has the most meat for the cheapest. the rice is lacking, so stick to the fries or just salad. they have a chicken gyro which is good and a chicken ceasar pita. those r what id stick to. I eat there at least 3 times a month. the gyro and eiether fries or salad is 6.25 and its never that crowded in the lot or the restaurant b/c most people order to go. they also get a lot of cops from the police station and theyre orginally from michigan. finally if your into sports, they tend to play them on their big screen."}
{"text":"The most delicious and authentic food in the Valley at George's Gyros. The owners are so friendly and hospitable they make you feel like home. Their Gyro sandwich is the best I have had at any other restaurant...not greasy or too heavy. Their salads are delicious and the Kalamata olives add to the perfection. I highly recommend this family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"The pita made it. Very fresh, soft and delicious. Super flavorful meat while keeping a very nice tenderness to it. My only complaint was that all of the sauce was put on one half of the Gyro. Kinda took away from the whole perfection of it. 

The fried zucchini was pretty damn good too!"}
{"text":"We never miss stopping at Georges when we are in the area. The best gyro in the Valley."}
{"text":"finally!  hands down best gyro in arizona... NO KIDDING.   we're from Detroit & it took us a while to find George's. So glad we did.  haven't had anything that wasn't just delish.  :)     oh. ...&we have tried the other \"Greek\" restaurants all around the east valley; nothing comes close."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyro. Try the original gyro if unsure what to get. Everything has been good. Best price for gyro type food. Call and order since there seems to always be a line."}
{"text":"We love it here. The chicken dinner plate is the best.  The portions are very generous. The rice is cooked and spiced just right. They give lots and lots of pita bread. I tried the fettuccine Alfredo today and it was good. The restaurant is clean and not noisy so you can talk and eat in peace. The staff is friendly and helpful when ordering. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come here atleast once a week. I love their chicken pita the side salad is so good or their French fries are good too. Prices are great too"}
{"text":"This mom-and-pop restaurant is one of my partner's and my favorite places to eat when going out. The food is prepared quickly, and it tastes delicious! The price isn't bad, especially considering how much food they put on the plate. 

I usually cycle between the original gyro and the chicken pita. You can choose either a salad or fries as your side. I personally choose the fries, since I'm not a big fan of their salad.  The gyro itself has lots of meat layered inside as well as a tasty sauce mixed with onions. The pita bread they use is great, too. Thick bread and holds the food contents well, just how I like it!

The only downside I can think of that affected me was that I didn't like the taste of the water very much. It's not that big of a deal if you're a soda drinker, though.

One more thing! They have a large TV that displays sports, so if you want to watch a game while having dinner out, it's not a bad place to be. I was able to catch the semi-final soccer game thanks to them.

If you're ever around downtown Mesa for an event or convention, I'd highly recommend eating here! Affordable, quick, and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you!

I came here for lunch with a friend and had the Chicken Pita with Salad. The dressing on my salad was so tasty that I wished I ordered a full salad for lunch. :) But once I tasted my pita I was equally satisfied! The food was delicious and if I'm in the area again, I would come by again."}
{"text":"Always packed with people. They gyros are packed with meat and flavor. It's family owned and it's worth a stop. Nothing fancy. Just solid good food."}
{"text":"Chicken pita with tzatziki  sauce and a side salad is my favorite. Get a side of sriracha and hummus. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food! The service is quick and laid back the attention to the details is amazing. Their tzatsiki is awesome just like their mustard sauce, fresh veggies and flavorful pitas! Had the Greek salad with chicken which was perfect light and the dressing was awesome. Also had the picado pita that was amazing the perfect mix of spicy. This is a gem of mesa"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious!  The Greek salad with gyro meat is phenomenal.  Everything here is tasty, and the prices are super reasonable.
Only one thing I dont like is their Water. It tasted weird. Not sure if it is their coke machine that dispense it or it just come that way from city of Mesa."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Food is consistently good and service fast and friendly. The gyro platter is my go to plate. We live close by so usually get the food to go, but on the occasions we've dined in we've enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My friend recommended George's for a good falafel pita. George's is plain, but this does not matter, only the food does! 

The falafel wasn't bad. I found it to be dry and plain. I don't want to completely toss this place out though, because it sounds like they also make a great greek salad. And to be honest, the gyro sauce was marvelous. So, George's, I will be back, and I look forward to that meal!"}
{"text":"Get the Gyro Picado and a side Greek salad. Also, their iced tea is the freshest in the game."}
{"text":"Best Gyros I've had. Super filling, good staff, and one time I bought a Coke and forgot to get it out of the fridge. I went back a couple weeks later to get another gyro and they gave it to me."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy food! This is a favorite at the office for lunch. Orders are always ready within 10-15 of calling and they've never disappointed. Cant go wrong with the original gyro and the hummus"}
{"text":"we had both of the gyro sandwiches, the original and the picado, as well as a pizza puff. absolutely to die for. the gyros were amazing and you bet we'll be back here before too long."}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken gyro w/ a Greek salad!  Yummmy!  so fresh and the sauce... delicious.  Not the best location and facility but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten the original gyro but it's soooo good! Love that it's a local family owned place. The foods always delicious and fresh. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had there has been fabulous!! Regular pita is great and so much good food! I also like the Greek salad and the souvlaki pits is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and was impressed with the quality. Fresh pita and delicious gyro overall, lots of flavor. They had no issue customizing the order, even the salad! Will be going back before I head out of town! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Clean place, very reasonable prices, delicious food, good selection, plenty of parking, and decent atmosphere.  I really can't complain; a great place for gyro/Mediterranean food.  The location is out of the way for me.  The atmosphere is clean and basic.  So not a nice looking place, but decent and probably most importantly, clean.  I'll keep this place in mind for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave a review, but this place has really good food. I had an original gyro with a Greek salad. It reminded me of my trip to Greece. The prices are also much more reasonable than a lot of other place. I will definitely be recommending it to others!"}
{"text":"This sets the standard for all Gyros for me. Everywhere else has to try to at least be close to George's. All fail. I can't speak to the entire menu because I can't get past the gyro and side salad. The fries look great and they do have pasta on the menu. 

The gyro's are the perfect blend of everything and delicious. I highly recommend them. It is a local joint and although they have tried to \"up\" the ambiance, it really doesn't matter. It is what it is. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I love this place - simple, reasonable prices, great food, and a full bar. very casual."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Mesa. The original gyro is excellent and tasty. The combo of great meat, fresh veggies, and some of the best sauce I've had on a gyro.
Whether you're big on Greek food or not, anyone can appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come to George's Gyros for a while, it he a big sign saying best Gyro in Arizona, and so you think it could be a trick or a sneaky marketing tactic. NO!! It's the BEST GYRO IN ARIZONA! It was extremely week cooked and the people are nice and polite! We also had the Dolmades and those were awesome as well! Please go to George's! It's great!"}
{"text":"Back east, we would call this place a \"Dive\".

And that's a good thing!
 It means you get great food, big portions, reasonable prices- a place to really get your \"grub on\" .........without any unnecessary pretense.

That being said, this isn't just a \"Gyro Stand\". The menu has a nice Chicken dish with lemon and capers over rice (kind of a Greek Piccata I guess), that my GF just loves. The hummus is excellent. The Greek salad w/Chicken is real Man-Salad material with big kalamata olives, feta, and a monstrous hand-tenderized, chargrilled chicken breast.

True to it's form, George's really delivers for people who don't need to pay too much to realize they're getting great food."}
{"text":"Another great experience, amazing origional gyro. Actually dined in this time,  brought the food right to you and cleaned your plates when you were done. Amazing service"}
{"text":"When I'm craving some gyros but don't want to spend too much, this is the place. A great gyro, dolmades are a must have as well. Good service, prices, friendly staff and a clean restaurant. Will most likely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the customer service is horrible. We choose them for our office party and ordered a day in advance. We got there and told them our form of pay and the bald guy was so upset. I mean, we are giving you business, we choose them, we choose to give them our money. In less than 30 minutes they earned more than $80dlls. The guy in the register was so rude and kept telling everyone their order was going to be late because of us. Like c'mon seriously? Why that attitude? Why so rude? We are never coming back here."}
{"text":"Really good gyros here!  I can't vouch for it being the \"best in Mesa\" or \"Best in AZ\" as it says in the window because its the only one I've been to in Mesa.  Very well could be!  The place is clean, the portions are decent and the wait was very short, probably less than 5 minutes.  I'd definitely come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Gyros! That is all I go there for even though they have a pretty good menu of other items. The prices and service are great also."}
{"text":"We love this place and they have never disappointed with food! Their pitas are delicious.  You can't go wrong with this place if you're in the downtown Mesa area."}
{"text":"This place was great. The gyro was delicious, it was served quickly, and the staff was friendly. I really enjoyed my visit and will take the family there. BTW, I was there for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Love this joint. Tasty gyro meat and good portions went from the gyro combo with fries to the gyro platter to get that salad and fries or rice. Twice as much food for only a couple bucks more. Slam dunksky!"}
{"text":"Love this place...clean, affordable and friendly, The meals are always fresh, generous portions...delicious! A true favorite of ours."}
{"text":"The gyros are delicious and there is a huge rush at lunch.  Don't be fooled by the slightly sketchy exterior.  I go with the chicken Caesar pita and I'm never disappointed.  They have side salad options but the fries are pretty tasty as well. The price is reasonable for what you get, worth trying!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Hot, fresh, gyros at a great price! We have been here 3-4 times and the service is alway fast and friendly. The parking lot is full for lunch and dinner which says a lot for the quality of the food. The quantity is generous. You could order an extra pita, split the filling in half, and have a second meal;) Don't let the location or dated look of the building dissuade you!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I worked at the East Valley Tribune down the street. I used to come here a lot with one of my co-workers because she enjoyed ogling the help (and also because the chicken pita with lemon mustard sauce was delicious).

Right before I changed jobs and moved across town, George's turned up in the paper's \"Dirty Dining\" feature about health code violations. I haven't been back since then, but judging from the reviews, I assume they've cleaned the place up (they would have been shut down if they hadn't). I'll have to go back some time!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was in elementary school (over 10 years ago) and the food is still amazing. It's very nostalgic for me when I eat here and I love how friendly everyone is. I get the chicken pita with mustard sauce and fries. I also love their fettuccini and burgers. They have good hummus and deserts. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We found this place by mistake. Really friendly staff. We saw that they got really great reviews so we decided to stop in. We got their famous gyro with fries. Very delicious food! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for a gyro. I've been coming to George's for a number of years and the staff is always friendly and they have stellar food. I love the chicken Caesar pita and also the gyro platter is amazing. If you have the chance and are in the area stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family has Greek food about twice a week, and were recommended this joint. The food is fresh and delicious, and when I asked for cucumber in lieu of a pita with my hummus, they complied at no extra cost. The gyro meat is outstanding, and I like that they have a little bar. I did have to ask twice for extra dressing, and had cheese on my salad when I asked for none. Otherwise, this would be a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place. For the price and what you get I give it 5 stars. The mozzarella sticks, single gyro w a salad and hummus with pita bread was amazing! I still have left overs but want to devour it all. The only thing I feel is missing is the gyro could add a little something else... although I got no tomatoes but I never do in gyros. But over all super cute quaint little place and friendly staff. I got it to go so once I got home it wasn't as fresh but still delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh pita bread. Ok gyro meat. Side salad with not-so-fresh lettuce and ingredients.
I wasn't impressed at all, and in my not-so-humble opinion, Chicago Gyro's and Pita Jungle are far superior.
This is not to say that it was bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about..."}
{"text":"Wow, just Wow! One of the best meals I've had in a looong time. Ordered the \"Greek Pasta\"  melted butter, garlic , oregano & fresh cut tomatoes , topped with feta cheese. This comes with a small side salad and a piece of garlic bread. The pasta was so tasty & fresh, the salad itself while unremarkable was made outstanding by the house dressing on the side. I've been here many times, never been unhappy with the food or the service. And such a reasonable price too. Give it a try you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We finally decided to give this place a try. We went in and placed our order to go. It took close to 30 minutes for the order to be ready. Not too bad, but seemed a little long considering there were only 2 other people there. Oh well, not that big of a deal. We ordered a couple of gyro plates and some fettucine alfredo. The gyros weren't bad...not the best I've had but not awful. For about $7.50 you get meat, salad (pretty good), rice, and 2 pitas. A pretty good value. They definitely needed more gyro/tatziki sauce so if we go back we will be sure to order some extra ($.45 each). The pasta was terrible. It literally tasted like one of those frozen entrees but cost $5.95...and the garlic bread that was included was pathetic. I was pretty disappointed but I guess I should've figured with a name like George's Gyros that the gyros would be the star of the show. Personally, I like Haji Babas in Tempe MUCH better, but for days when I just don't want to make the drive, this will work."}
{"text":"Anyone who really enjoys this place has no clue what good gyros are. First, my party sat there for an hour waiting on our food. They lost our order!! They did not offer to comp the meal; ridiculous! After eating lunch it was not worth being assertive because I knew we would not be back. Even the rice was \"off.\" White rice with tomato sauce??? I missed the usual yellow rice. Disappointing that the ice tea was not brewed. I did like the side salad. I should mention that my chicken gyros was not gyros at all; thinly sliced chicken."}
{"text":"George's Gyros is definitely the place to go for a gyro fix. The pita bread is so soft and pliable. The tzatziki sauce complements the juicy, thinly sliced meat very well. I love how they use a special slicing tool to shave the meat off the spindle. I always order my gyro with grilled onions make a huge difference versus ordering with the raw onion. Definitely an inexpensive place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to this place multiple times over the past few years and I always get the Original Gyro.  Decent deal at $7 since it comes with a side of salad or fries.

To be honest, I haven't tried a lot of other gyro places.  I've been to other shawarma places (I can't tell the difference yet, SORRY) that are pretty competitive in taste, but I don't believe they come close to the price.

I also called once to place an order for pick-up like 15 minutes before close and raced over to pick it up 5 minutes before they closed.  I felt bad doing it, but I was really craving gyros and I respect that they were chill about it.

I took my mom here and she was apprehensive at first since she wasn't big on lamb meat, but the main dude was super cool about it and gave her a free sample which she ended up liking.  I was gonna give this place a 4/5, but the friendly service on top of quality gyros and price easily makes it a 5/5 for me."}
{"text":"Good place to go :) a bit on the bland side but good! I got the Steak pita and the steak was perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"We've been to Georges many times in the past, when we used to live over in that area. This last visit was very deliberate, since I am never in that neck of the woods, and me and my hubby decided that we would stop and eat lunch there.
We always get the original Gyros with fries, or you can have a side salad, that seems to be very good too. My son had the chicken nuggets, since he doesn't like eating many \"different\" things, so we go with the safest option for him. He seemed to enjoy them, they looked pretty generic to me, but they came with a mound of fries, that he shared with his little sister.
   The gyros were as usual, very good, with the perfect amount of tzatziki sauce, and onions and tomatoes. The pita bread was soft and good. Overall, it was really yummy, and although I am sure there are many places out there that might have better food, we like it here!!"}
{"text":"I was in this area around lunch time and my colleague suggested we come here. I had never been to this place before, and he insisted it was great. 

First off, had it not been for his glowing recommendation I probably would never have come here. It's not much to look at and it looks unimpressive inside. It's pretty small and the linoleum floors are outdated. 

But when I took a bite out of my food, I was bowled over. 

I ordered a gyro salad. The gyro, which I found out was not made by them, was very good. I think I would have given this place a 5 star review if they had made the gyro meat themselves, but the woman at the counter had said they get it made like this from somewhere else. 

I mean, it is called George's Gyro. I thought they would have made it themselves. But nevertheless, the salad was perfect. I haven't had a greek salad this good before. It had the right amount of gyro meat, dressing and the veggies tasted fresh. 

I'm hardly ever in this area, but if I was close by and in a pinch, I would feel comfortable coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. Only 4 stars because they use so much plastic and styrofoam in their packaging. I would order take out here much more often if they were a little more environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I eat here fairly regularly because it's close to the office and they make really good deep fried zucchini. Their spaghetti is good too. I think they should remodel so that they have more dining space, and  do something about the long lines at lunch time going out the door. (Maybe have two people taking orders instead of one?)."}
{"text":"This place has the best Gyros in the east valley.
Costumer service is always spot on, and the food is always fresh.

I have been and will continue to come here for years to come for my gyros."}
{"text":"Really not sure where the higher ratings are coming from?

This is a solid place to grab a bite, but the gyros are very average.
Maybe people are bumping the ratings because of the cool selection of drinks?  The bar?  (A fast-food format gyro place with a full bar - gotta admit, that was a first for me).

You won't leave hungry, but there are better gyros out there."}
{"text":"Good food at this little place.  Its pretty casual and the menu is mostly fried stuff,  but if your hungry its a nice place to stop for a bite.  They have more options than most small diners and some healthy choices.
FYI Fries are very good."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB when it comes to gyros!  The meat is so tender, juicy and tasty!!  It's a modest (hole in the wall) establishment but hey, those are the best kinds most the time!  I have taken many friends here and have yet to have one not agree that this food ROCKS!!  Not to mention the boys at the register are nice to look at ;p~"}
{"text":"I've been going to George's for years. I've had the Gyros and the hamburgers and fries. Everything I've ever ate at this place has been fantastic. The people are really nice they say hi to you every time they see you and they always have a smile."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Had dinner here tonite. Nice and clean, very friendly staff. I ordered an original Gyro with salad and my table mate ordered the steak fajitas and salad. It was so good, I forgot to take a pic!.  Everything was very fresh and pleasantly plated. 
They have 10 tables, but seem to have a healthy take out business also. 
Their menu includes Greek Pizzas, Puta sandwiches, full dinners, burgers/hotdogs, and Pastas. 
You've gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Drove by place many times and finally stopped. Amazingly fresh food. Ordered the greek platter and a couple gyros. I was so happy to taste amazing fresh flavors. Portions are large and prices are reasonable.....and it is very good. New regular here!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Gyro, claims to be best in valley (guess \"best of\" is not rewarded by publications anymore) but is more like top 5. Service is always friendly and quick, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The owner is friendly and cares about his food.  The tasty dishes are filling so be hungry.  There are long lines at lunch as the food is good.  Lots of people come for take out as well.  This casual joint is clean and perfect to fill yourself up."}
{"text":"If I could live here and eat Gyros and Greek Pizza all day I would. The food is one of my favorite places, the decor is simple and prices are reasonable. Plus you can get a whole ton of gyro meat (just the meat)."}
{"text":"Great gyro for a great price! I got the original gyro and chose the Greek salad instead of fries. The salad is decently sized and the Gyro is definitely worth the size. I paid a little under $7.00 for my meal with no drink. It was pretty busy at the time I went, it was about 12:15pm I only waited about 10 minutes for my food to go. I would probably recommend calling in your order if you're in a rush! The cashier was friendly and helpful, definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is much nicer inside than it looks from the outside.  Nice flat screen tv to watch.  Good drink choices - two flavors of fresh brewed tea.

The gyros was good.  The pita was so soft.  The meat was okay - Pita Bistro has my all time favorite gyros meat so it is hard to compare to that.

Salad was a very nice amount.  Fries were hot and greasy but the grease tasted a little bit fishy (old)."}
{"text":"i crave their gyros & go to get one almost every weekend! their tzatziki sauce is the best & my favorite. I was trying gyros all around Phoenix for awhile & as soon as i found Georges i started just going there only! best gyro in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"All Around good food.

This is my Favorite place for Gyros. Best for Lunch or Takeout, the seating is OK but the place is usually full. Everything Ive tried on the menu has been very good, we eat lunch here on a regular basis and its just constantly good. All the Greek food is good or better than you would expect, but the biggest surprise is the hot wings, and their cheap too."}
{"text":"I avoided trying this place because it never looked busy when I would drive by. We ended up eating here for dinner with a friend, seems most orders are to go. Our gyros, fries and salads all were very good and the prices pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch from time to time. Great food for a great price. So if you like gyros then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and absolutely love this place for their gyros. Best gyros I think I have had in Mesa (food is always ready between 10-15 mins if you call ahead). Not only that the owners (I believe they are, we always see them) always know our order and now don't have to give names which is always a nice touch for them to actually remember you. You get lots of food for a pretty good price. My only complaint would be when we get home the fries are soggy, but I chalk that up to the 10 minute drive home."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions are a good size for the price."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this place so I decided to give it a try. I had the Gyro lunch with fries. It was pretty good, nothing outrageous and I've definitely had better but given the area and it's limited lunch options I can see myself coming back here in the future.

The restaurant was small and service was friendly. The \"bar\" was awkward; looked like it didn't really belong but I guess it's always great to have the option of enjoying a drink with your meal. I guess I see this more of a quick service dine and dash kind of joint, that's why."}
{"text":"I was craving a gyro and went to yelp to help me give me some ideas. Due to all the great comments about the food, I had made my decision and decided to try it out for myself. Well.... very happy I did. Food was great! Lots of meat and the salad was delicious! Although the place is not very pretty to look at, the food is well worth it. What's even better, it's super close to my house. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get good quality food and at a very reasonable price. The Greek salad with chicken is fantastic!  Georges is run by a welcoming group of people, always a smile and serving great food. I would give them 10 stars if that were an option. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, but lacks quality service. What ever happened to first come, first served?"}
{"text":"Not being from Mesa, I asked where a good place was to eat. One of the guys in the shop suggested George's. Great place to grab a good lunch. Excellent Gyro and Greek Salad! Awesome. Definitely will eat there when I am in the area next time!"}
{"text":"How have we lived in Mesa for 12 years and only now found Georges?  We are big fans of Mediterranean food and the food at Georges is delicious.  Nothing super fancy, just good food.  Love their gyro or chicken platters.  You can also get typically Italian food like beef sandwiches and pasta.  

The restaurant itself is pretty small with only a few tables so we typically get our food to go.  

Everyone at the restaurant is nice and friendly.  We get take out a few times a month."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Was recommended by a shop down the street and they didn't disappoint. Menu is simple so you don't sit there wondering what to order. Ended up having the gyro picado and it was delicious. Fries were the perfect kind of crispiness. Make sure to get there before the lunch hour craze."}
{"text":"I always come here and my food is always delicious! The original gyro is the best. The service here is always friendly I've never had a problem"}
{"text":"Great pitas here for a good price. Steak can be a little dry but the chicken is great!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal at George's. Never misses they are friendly and always puts out quality food.  We stop here after track practices and during track meets.  Everyone wants to know where we got the food from"}
{"text":"This is a ma and pa store and that's one reason why I like it. Stop in and see George if you can. I've been here once and actually got served by George. Yes, they really are Greek. The place is a little, yellow joint with a tiny outdoor table with one rainbow colored umbrella over it. The inside is better. They have a tiny table and some stools for a \"bar\". However, there are cool posters of Greece on the wall that make up for the modesty of the place. The gyros are good, not sure about the American food. They have cold beers. Prices are reasonable. It's always dead when I drive by it. Hope it survives the depression. Tried to go back one time at 10AM when the door said it was open but the door was locked and nobody was inside. If I had more cash on hand, I would try another trip."}
{"text":"For years Georges has been my favorite place to eat Gyros! And at the lunch hour this is definitely the place to be! 

Their Gyros Sandwiches come with either a Greek salad, which is full of great veggies and always fresh or some really tasty fries! Wow writing this review makes me want to rush over to Georges now!!

They serve everything Greek you can think of as well as Italian. There food is always delicious and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a small business owner in the neighborhood. It was good Greek food, not the best ever, but solid. The kids had cheeseburgers, I had Greek Salad with gyro meat (slightly dry) and husband had Gyro sandwich (which he loved) and then as an afterthought he ordered hummus and pita and the pita was amazing, warm and soft."}
{"text":"I just ordered lunch from here for the first time. I ordered the original gyro with a side salad. I also got their hummus and pita appetizer.

I will say that I really enjoyed the gyro. The taziki sauce had great flavor and the meat was shaved perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised that the side salad was in fact a Greek salad.

The hummus was okay. Not saying it was bad it just didn't wow me.

Overall I would recommend George's and will certainly be eating there again."}
{"text":"Good hummus, pita is great. Greek salad fair."}
{"text":"Yum!! We meant to go to Posidon, but seeing that Posidon was closed for no apparent reason, we headed up the street to George's instead. It looked like a crummy gyro fast food place from the outside (and inside to be honest). The menu had all the Greek must haves but nothing too crazy. After ordering a chicken pita with salad, I discovered that they didn't need to extra frills to prove how great they are. The chicken was cooked perfect, pita was soft and delicious, and the salad was exactly what I had been craving with it's balance of dressing, feta cheese, onions, and Greek olives. The boyfriend also nom-ed every last piece of his pork pita with tzatziki sauce on the side.
I give George's five stars because their food blows other chain and better known Greek places out of the water- but they aren't gimmicky or over done. It's rather unfortunate that it's in a part of Mesa that might not be bringing in all the business it deserves. I'd like to relocate this place next to ASU, really. 
Next time I want to try the hummus and dolmades..mm."}
{"text":"This place is just an average Gyro joint. Flaming kabobs and haji baba are at better, but when in mesa and you need some gyros this place is alright"}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit. I saw all the great reviews and it is close to home. I so did not care for the original gyro sandwich.  The sauce was subpar and very little and the tomatoes were hard to be found. I like lettuce on my sandwich and this was not offered. It did not have the quality I am used to.  I gave 2 stars only because my son, who is sooooo darn picky loves this place..  so when I can get him to eat meat, this is what he wants.  As for me, I do not order or eat here."}
{"text":"If you like Gyros, then you will love this place, I do, good portions, very tasty.  They even serve booze there, but usually I am there for lunch, so have to go back to work, but its a great place."}
{"text":"Wow!  Yelp did it again. On vacation with my wife and this little nugget of great Greek food was right down the road from our hotel.  Great gyro!!!! Fast service, nice atmosphere what more could you want!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a meal this bad in years. Combo sausage sandwich was half filled with tiny cut up pieces of sausage. Other half had none. Beef on said sandwich was flavorless. Greek fries which I was charged a extra dollar for were gross with too much vinegar. Never had a greek fry with vinegar on it. Wish I could get a refund. Would never go back. It's embarrassing that this place was so busy at the time here."}
{"text":"Had the original gyro. Was pretty good! Only had the gyro meat, tomatoes and onions. But it wasn't too bad overall."}
{"text":"I tried a Georges Gyro's for the first time on Sunday at a different location in Tempe. The gyro I got that time was absolutely delicious, with a pita that was lightly toasted to perfection. So, having been so impressed by that meal, I decided to eat at the Georges Gyros in Mesa on Monday. I ordered the George Pizza with high expectations and was really let down. The food tasted ok and it would have been great if it had been properly cooked, but what I got was severely disapppointing. The cheese on my pizza was barely melted and the pita crust was still doughy and completely uncooked, it didn't have the slightest hint of browning or crispness. As a result I couldn't even eat it like a pizza, the bottom was too soft and floppy and it had to be eaten with a fork, and the mushy doughy consistency of the crust felt kinda gross in my mouth. The service was good, food was not."}
{"text":"Totally wasn't expecting this place to be good but it is! I think for the low price, you get your food fast and it's a pretty decent amount. And the taste is great.

I ordered Original Gyro and chose the side of salad that was included for $7. Very nice tasting for both. I have been to other places where that same price was only for a gyro with no salad. Overall, it was pretty filling and I would come back again for a satisfying meal.

Cheap, really tasty, fast, and filling. Yep, meets all my criteria for good restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food for take out. The atmosphere us fast food but they have a full bar and hopefully that means liquor license!! I live close enough to get the food home hot and eat here 3 or 4 times a month. Their pork for souvlaki is amazing and fresh. Souvlaki gyros are my downfall. Unless you count an Athens stir fry with pork. Yummy in my Tummy
 Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Amazing, best Gyro i have ever had and the greek salad is the great. Good pricing, good people, and they serve a good selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Super yummy. My favorite is the chicken plate. Everything here is amazing! One of my favorite places when I'm on this side of the valley."}
{"text":"I go here as much as possible for lunch or to grab a quick take out for dinner.  Never have i had a meal that was less than great.  Perfect portions, service and great prices.  As close as it is to the Mesa PD, i don't think they go there due proximity, more the great food at a great price."}
{"text":"If you're gonna eat here get the lamb gyro or the gyro platter. They are the best! The best appetizer I've tried so far is the fried zucchini. They have other stuff that's good but they are most definitely the best gyro I've tried in Arizona."}
{"text":"Location- easy to find and plenty of parking
Ambiance- casual, clean, and sensible. Although the owner is continuously trying to modernize the place.
Service- friendly. You order upon entering find a table and it will be taken to you. Usually a 5 to 10 min wait to get your food depending what was ordered.
Food- Delicious! They have a simple menu, with much variety of choices: gyros, burger, hot dog, greek pizza, pasta, and salads. I enjoy that you can choose a salad as a side vs french fries."}
{"text":"I love Georges!! I have been going here for years!  They have the best gyro in Mesa for sure.  If you have never been try the greek club pita first.  Their chicken caesar salad and chicken caesar pita are both delicious.  They just remodeled the inside.  They have a large outdoor patio if the weather is nice.  I highly recommend Georges Gyros, its one of the best restaurants in Mesa."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for a Greek salad & some humus with pita bread, this is where I head :) 

Not much to look at but the food is great & the service is friendly. If you're going for lunch I'd recommend making it an early or late lunch, it can get crowded."}
{"text":"I flew in for a few days and this was close to my hotel so I stopped in, I love gyros. The costumer service was great and it was a good environment, but the gyro was not what I have had elsewhere. I come from Provo, UT (not many great places to eat) and the gyros in Provo are far superior and cheaper than here. This said, they were pretty big and filling and decently delicious; nothing above average."}
{"text":"Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  \"What's good?\"  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors..."}
{"text":"A good place to get a gyro. The meat was cooked well, and the Pita was warm and chewy, but the Tzatziki was below average, the vegetables were an afterthought on the Gyro, and the fries were overly salted. The sandwich was okay overall and I will definitely return as I live in the area, but I have had better Gyros elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really like this place - so much that I'm still giving them five stars after getting the wrong salad on a pickup order. The staff are always so nice and the food tastes great regardless of what you order."}
{"text":"Not sure the reason for the sub-par ratings and yet great comments = #yelparazzi. Obviously this isn't a 5-star restaurant type which will valet your car or care to wipe your ass just so you'll come to Yelp and rate them 5-stars. This is a 5-star restaurant which is family driven, whom dedicate their time making delicious food. I eat here once a week and for the first time I didn't order the Gyro Picado (FLIPPIN DELICIOUS) .... George recommended I try the chicken, so I got the Chicken Picado and ... oh man the options I have now."}
{"text":"George Gyros lunch was great! I took a group of 11 for lunch as our first time hoping to dodge lunch rush at 1130am. We all ordered, took our seats and within 10min our salads where on the table. 
Chicken salads are large and so are the dinner plates!! Everything was fresh and loved the pita breads. Some restaurants skimp out on pita bread, but not George. Prices are reasonable and you won't be hungry when you leave.
The  dinning area is smaller than expected from the outside. Overall the service was good, food is great and we will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Great food, the service friendliness could be improved a little, but over all i really like it and would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Owners are great. The gyros are so delicious. The pita bread is so soft and fluffy. Yum."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at George's. My boyfriend is constantly trying to get me to agree to go there and until last night, I've always brushed it off. I've eaten at a George's in Scottsdale (not sure if they are related) and got sick, so I wasn't in any hurry to try this location. First of all, when we walked in, the gentleman (not sure if he was the owner or an employee) was helping a single mom with her 3 small kids. She placed her order and her card got declined. After getting declined on a second card, he paid for her meal. I have never seen a restaurant show kindness like that. Not only did he pay for her meal, he helped her kids scoot their chairs in and gave them top notch customer service as if they had paid for everything on the menu and left a fat tip. We ordered our food to go and he was also very kind and friendly to us. After the experience in the restaurant was so great, all I kept thinking was \"please don't let the food suck so I can leave an awesome review!\" I was not disappointed. We both ordered their Gyro with a salad. The pita was soft and delicious. The meat was great, veggies fresh, and Tzatziki tied the whole Gyro together. All of the vegetables in the salad looked and tasted amazing as well, and the Greek dressing was perfect. All in all, this was a more than pleasant experience with great customer service and tasty food. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I'll be back fo sho!!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast, and the lady at the counter helpful.

I purchased two gyro sandwiches. The meat was very tender, but that is where my personal enjoyment ended.

The pita bread was very doughy. When squeezed it would pinch together like it was not cooked. 

The meat was very very lightly seasoned to the point of only barely making out the flavor. The tzatziki sauce was sparse and also not much flavor. To me the tzatziki sauce can either make or break a gyro quite often. Tomato, a couple tiny thumb size pieces, and several onion pieces the same size.

Now, there is nothing wrong with what I just mentioned, aside from the doughy pita. Many individuals prefer their gyro flavor on the lighter side and this fits that bill.

I prefer a gyro with a much more robust flavor, and the pita lightly grilled.

Do I feel it is worth just about $6 each? Not in anyway. This should have been priced about $5 at most."}
{"text":"While by no means am I a Mediterranean food connoisseur, I will say that this place is quite tasty! For $6.25, I had an excellent meal here. I had a Falafel rolled pita, and it came with a nice amount of Greek salad. The Falafel was hot, tasted fresh, and was well-seasoned. Very flavorful. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that stop you! Total dives have the best food ever!"}
{"text":"Out of the 10 or so places I've had Gyro's at near my home, this is probably the best in the East Valley.
     The food is fresh, very good and worth the low cost. The staff is great and happy to make sure you get just what you want. 
     For a good healthy meal with lots of flavor this is a great place to come."}
{"text":"Blah gyros and frozen fries. I seriously can't even begin to understand what all of the hoopla is over this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to George's for years. I am never disappointed. Everything in there is top-notch - service is wonderful the atmosphere is great and you can't beat the gyros!!!"}
{"text":"It was good as it has always been every time I come. the salads are really good the price you pay for the platter is very good for the amount of food you receive however I did not like that the pieces of pita bread or cut up instead of the \"taco style\" gyro i'm used to getting"}
{"text":"Visited the Phoenix area during Memorial Weekend. My husband wanted to try this place so badly because of the wonderful Yelp reviews ;-). I'm not that adventurous with food and never want to try new things. I trusted my husband and agreed to go. I ordered the original gyro. We also ordered fried mushrooms and hubby got some dinner platter.  I really enjoyed my gyro. You get so much goodness for a good price. Ate til my stomach hurt, in a good way, of course. Coming back out in August and will definitely stop by here again!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting George's Gyros here in Mesa. Star was friendly and the gyros was delicious."}
{"text":"I found this awesome establishment due to Yelp! It was great. I decided to surprise my boyfriend with Greek food because I feel bad that every single time he asks me what I want to eat, I select Mexican food putting no thoughts into any other person or food type (terrible, I know). I ordered him the original Gyro with Greek fries and a side of falafels. I also asked for a side of their well known, should be famous and should be patented and sold in jars mustard sauce...He loved all of it. The falafels while smaller than we are used to, were extremely tasty and everything a falafel should be, greatness chickpea, garlicky balls of goodness. His gyro meat was great and the sauce was good too. My chicken salad was good, tons of chicken, cooked just right. The char, the grilled flavor and the greens were fresh, good and I enjoyed it, a lot. I actually REALLY like their chicken. The customer service was excellent and the joint was clean. I am sure we will be back...zero complaints :)"}
{"text":"Very good gyros, clean place, nice service, they have the food fast and prices are also good. I had the original gyro and it was the best I had in a while, I am glad that I found this place. I've gone to many and I wasn't happy. They also give you a side of salad or fries."}
{"text":"The best gyros in town by far. A nice quiet place to get lunch and get caught up on some espn. If you like spicy stuff, try the gyro picado."}
{"text":"Really good Greek food in Mesa. I usually get the Gyro it comes with a side and I get the Greek salad it's super good! Then for dessert the Baklava is also very delicious. All for a very affordable price of around $8 and some pocket change. I highly recommend this place if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner, this is the 2nd time being here in a week. The food is so delicious, and the employees were courteous and friendly. I'm not a food critic but I do love food and the food must be good for me to enjoy, for I am the most pickiest eater and trust when I say my thumb is up! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good fries and gyros along with hummus is so great!!  This place needs more parking and seats if you ask me."}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro meat. Could use more sauce. Be aware the picado gyro has almost no onions or peppers (and very little sauce). Still tasty and pita was good but would have liked more of the onions and peppers. 

Onion rings are a complete waste of money - doughy, partially cooked, just a disaster.

They have a full liquor license too but not really a bar to sit at.

Friendly service.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"On a rainy Monday in Mesa, there weren't a lot of choices for lunch, but seeing the Yelp reviews for George's I decided to have lunch there. I love Greek food and gyros, but this was not it. The meat in the gyro was dry and the pita was soggy. The fries were underdone. The only good thing was the hummus. The service was good and the bathroom was clean. Other than that, George's should be on your \"must miss\" list."}
{"text":"I LOVE  this place.  The staff is incredible.  They are quick with to go orders and if you sit inside.  Their food appears fresh and made to order.  I get their chicken gyro with salad every time.  It comes out the same.  It is very inexpensive for the amount you get.  Don't let the outside fool you, this place is very clean and their is a small bar on the left side right after the patio seating."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros. First time here but not the last. Nice hot food and fresh. Relaxing atmosphere. Thanks George! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Classic Gyro joint food! Can't go wrong with the Original Gyro, with a Greek Salad.. being the mega carnivore I am, I opt for extra meat! :) Order some extra tzatziki sauce if you're a fan of it.. I tend to enjoy my gyros swimming in it.  Also, the building itself is a great example of classic Mid-century \"Googie\" Architecture. Glad to have such a cool little spot a block away."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I love Georges, the best gyros in town, get fries or salad you can't go wrong with either. I can't decide which I like better the chicken pita or the original gyro both are so good guess it depends on your mood.  The lasagne is totally delish too.  My only complaint is the soda & tea tastes off, they definately need to install an RO system."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the greater Phoenix valley. Worth the drive. Try the chicken picado if you like spicy food. They even have spaghetti."}
{"text":"I've been to four Greek restaurants this week looking for good food and couldn't find it. Until I went to George's  this is the best gyro humus pit and falafel in Phoenix by far. 
If I were them I would open up a sit down restaurant because they could charge allot more for they're food"}
{"text":"I came here last night to try this place out, and its not half bad.  Definately a local dive, its a tired little resturant that seems to have been around forever.  Definately a local mom and pop type shop.

They have an ample menu, with a variety of items to choose from.  I went with the original Gyro, and got a greek salad. I really enjoyed the salad quite a bit, and the Gyro was ample and tasty.  You definately get your money's worth here!

I recommend at least tryng this place, as the Gyros were worth every penny.  Its a no frills little dive, but the food makes up for lack of decor! O, and this place is closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the friendly employees. Must get the Gyro it's the best I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Beautiful, an oasis among acres of black top.
A Greek food joint that's a welcome distraction from burgers and tacos. 
Service was kind, from her welcoming smile coming in from the heat to the genuine \" thank you\" as I left. The men in the back putting it all together were keeping there cool even during the lunchtime rush. Need I say professional?
The food was fresh and not surprisingly full of flavors.
What is surprising is how clean this restaurant is! The windows, floors and tables all shined. I'm looking...clean.
I'm just passing through but I'll pass by here again.
Last word...Opa!"}
{"text":"Amazing amount of food. Meals come with either fries or a greek salad.

I went with the original gyro, and a salad.

The salad was delicious, with just enough dressing.

The gyro was fantastic, with fresh tomatoes and tzatziki.

Prices are above fast good, but the quality is definitely there, and it's nice to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Had the gyro combo cause it comes with very good hand cut fries. It was perfect more than enough meat could have maybe used some lettuce but I'm from back east and they are served that way."}
{"text":"Im from Detroit so I'm always skeptical of pita spots... but this place is legit! I come at least once a week for the chicken pitas (caesar is my fave) all the dressings are home made and amazing"}
{"text":"This place takes forever to cook your food. I placed my order at 12.07 and didn't receive it until 12.37. I would expect this from Applebee's but not a fast food restaurant. They forgot to put in my Taziki  sause after I pacifically ask them if it was in there. I ordered the spicy gyro which was pretty good it comes  side salad or Fry's. Was kind of dry with out the sause."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great prices, fresh food and clean restaurant and staff. I love that the cooks wear hairnets."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!  First trip.  I don't eat lamb so tried the steak pita & salad.  Out of this world!  Will be patronizing often. Pita soft and delicious.  Steak perfect & plentiful.  Side salad on large side and could be a meal in it's self.  New to area and this is definitely a happy find!  Friendly guy at counter.  Ordered to go & fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"We go here a few times a month and get gyros or one of the assorted greek or italian dishes. Fast service and one of the better greek-mediterranean choices in the valley."}
{"text":"I would love to give these guys a better rating because they do have the best Gyros however; when they say they open at 10:30a and you wait 15 minutes past that time and they don't come to the door nor do they unlock the doors and we know they're there because we said hello when they stepped out from the side door... well then you loose customers and business! 2 sets of customers drove off. Obviously they don't need the business! So sad!!"}
{"text":"Had the Greek Salad with Gyro meat. The meat and salad were pretty good but not the best Greek Salad I have had. The salad is primarily iceburg lettuce with some tomatoes and a few bell peppers. Price was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Chicken pita is really good with the honey mustard,  I have been here a couple of times.  If I'm ever in the area I certainly stop in for very well priced delicious lunch.  If I could offer any suggestions it would be the decor of the place could use some renovating, however doesn't take away from the may point of being there EATING"}
{"text":"Love, love, love me some George's!  Their food is delicious!  The Greek salad with gyro meat is phenomenal.  Everything here is tasty, and the prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and my dad is from Greece and this is the best Gyro in AZ. Reminds me of what I used to get in Chicago!!! Great prices and awesome food. MUST STOP!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I'm originally from the Chicago area, where Gyros places are a dime a dozen and I had been missing it until I found George's.  Just like the places back home.  Good food, good prices, the staff is as friendly as can be and they even have a small bar if you want a drink with dinner.    I reccomend a shot of Ouzo.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here once before, it's okay it's not the best but it's okay and if your hungry George's gyros will do.

Went here around 10:00 a.m. Looking for a quick and early lunch. Waited outside because the restaurant was not open yet. Which was fine we didn't mind waiting. We saw some employees outside little after 10:30 than finally someone pulled up in a vehicle and let everyone inside. We were gonna wait awhile longer in the car but it was hot and did not want want to waste the battery due to the fact that our car needs a battery replacement. Anyways by than it was about 10:45 went it the lights where still off the cashier/server was still opening his register. Which I repeat was fine we wouldn't have cared to wait a little bit longer. But as soon as we walked they ignored us the cashier just walked off. Im only assuming they must have been thinking \"ugh these people are in waaaaay too early for some gyros\" yeah I admit we were, but we wouldn't have mind to wait. After standing there awkwardly while everyone ignored our presence I asked if \"they were open yet\" and the cashier out of nowhere said \"no not yet\" and walked away. Finally we decided to go eat somewhere else and we turn to walk out and the cashier pops out of nowhere again and says \"you guys can wait in here it's ok\" ....after waiting and awkwardly standing the cashier finally acknowledges us? I don't want to tell anyone how to run a business but that was just embarrassing. First, the cashier should have welcomed us, and explained to us that \"no they were not ready to open but would be soon in x amount of minutes\" we would've been fine with that. Second, if your gonna ignore your customers don't plea with them on the way out the door, you've already lost out on some money. Again we would've been fine with a simple welcome and explanation, were understanding/patience people. 

After that experience we will not be coming back to George's gyros."}
{"text":"This Gyro place ever. This place has ruined Gyros for me forever I cannot eat one anywhere else. They have the softest pita bread and the most tender juicy meat. Get the original gyro or for just a little bit more you can get a gyro platter and get almost double the food."}
{"text":"As far as quick gyros go, this place is great!  I got the original gyro and fries.  The food was really good and obviously made fresh.  The employee who took my order and brought me my meal was incredibly nice.  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat this is the place to go! They offer so many different dishes, they also have a mini bar. the interior is lacking( they could use an efficient pinterester lol) but you came for food and you will get delicious food. I like to get the gyro with fries and put the fries in my gyro (yummy)."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious this was my first time visiting and I will definitely be coming back but let me tell you how good this guy row is Gyro and I enjoyed it with the fresh salad I also took a picture and I sat outside the lady was very nice enough to bring me napkins salt pepper and also brought the food outside to me it was just perfect five very organic and very fresh."}
{"text":"Got to love this place. Couple of coworkers first introduced it to me, and it is JUST close enough to comfortablely eat there on my lunch break.
The gyro meat has always been juicy/fresh, pitas warm and tsatziki sauce ratio on point. Their hummus is pretty good too, even on the next day.
Wil definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ive driven by this place several times and always wanted to check it out. I finally had time to get some lunch downtown and rolled over for a gyro. Its actually really clean, but pretty small inside. There was a line from the time I got there to the time i left after eating. There was a cashier, waitress/busser, and a cook working and I gotta say those 3 were hustling but making it look easy! The line was moving pretty quick and food cake out in no time. I ordered the gyro picado which had peppers and jalapenos in it and it was BOMB! It was spicy enough to make it burn a bit, but not too hot! The pita was warm and doughy! It was over all so good! Ill def be coming back again when I'm on this side for lunch!"}
{"text":"Better than I expected! We live nearby and finally grabbed some food to-go. I ordered the Gyro Plattar and it was very generously sized - I was able to eat half for dinner and half for lunch the next day. The gyro meat is delicious and everything else is good, too. We will definitely be back to try some other offerings."}
{"text":"This place is Great! The Portions are large to say the least. I ordered the Gyro platter and was very happy with the quality of the food that came out. It even came with a side salad that was a nice appetizer. The staff was very friendly and told me what i need to order for my first time there. I was very satisfied and had leftovers to satisfy my hunger again :)"}
{"text":"I heard this was the best gyro in town. It was ok. I felt like it had too much going on. My kid has spaghetti and pasta sauce but I had the gyro. Liked the look of the place, easy to get into and out of, and was pretty cool. There were no other people here. The gyro was totally yummy and she ate all her food, too. Not the best for sure, but if you want a gyro in Mesa, go here."}
