{"text":"TH is a great spot for lunch, brunch, dinner or drinks.  I work in Ohio City and TH is my go to lunch spot.  Service is always great and the food is fantastic.  The corn bisque is phenomenal and the sweet potato pancakes are a must try at brunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Had some board games for the kids. Awesome atmosphere.  Bone broth and Tomato bisque were both great"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun; the beers great; the decor cool. But the food was disappointing. My sister and I both had the zucchini noodle salad and there was nothing to it - I had the shrimp - $12 - and she had the steak - $14 - and we were both still hungry after eating it all. There were lots of zucchini noodles, 2 small Apple chunks, one red pepper and a handful of shrimp/steak. Flavorful but much too skimpy - super disappointing. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visited Town Hall today (Memorial Day). The food and drinks were very good. However, I had issues with the many dogs on the patio. Don't get me wrong, I like dogs. However, the dogs should not impact other diners. A dog licked my wife's hand as we sat down in our seats. And the dogs barked constantly throughout lunch."}
{"text":"Great patio, impeccable service (thanks Kara) and the food was on point! Definitely recommend it's. Good health options but also great burgers etc."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've hit Townhall while on business to Cleveland. In a great spot near the Great Lakes brewery so I recommend hitting both. This place has dozens of amazing beers on tap from all regions around the US. Good atmosphere and helpful staff. The best industrial decor I've seen."}
{"text":"Town hall is one of my favorite place to go if I wanna grab some drinks with my friends. Food is delicious and the drinks are spectacular! Owner takes pride of the service and always a great experience for me and my family! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Huge bourbon and beer selection! A ton of local spirits, and a lot of the fruits and veggies came from the West Side Market which is awesome! Food and drink prices were reasonable. They are having opening month difficulties with new servers and hostesses. Service was not quick but the place was packed and our waitress was brand new. Service was better than some long time establishments. 
I had the spicy chicken curry noodles and she has the veggie burger. Noodle bowl was amazing! Not too spicy, lots of flavor! The veggie burger was a little weird. The flavors were fantastic but it was too soft, not cooked well enough. It was pretty pink because of the beets but it was still a little unappetizing.

We will be back to try other food and bourbons!"}
{"text":"Our visit to town hall down the street from west side market was remarkable. My first impression was of artsy custom wooden decor including the wine fridge behind the bar.
My boyfriend and I were greeted when we sat at the bar and were offered a vast selection of on tap beer. The #4 was great not to hoppy.
We ordered an appetizer, prosciutto wrapped dates; a nice blend of salty and sweet.
After, we got a Kobe burger and a grilled cheese with vegan chili. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The grilled cheese presentation excelled.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland on vacation, looking for a vegetarian friendly restaurant and this one was at the top of several lists. Wow! What a a spectacular place! From the service, to the beer list,  to the incredible food, Town Hall knocked it out of the park. Our server, Rachel, was not only super friendly, but informative as well. We were informed that pretty much anything on the menu could be made to our preferences( for vegetarians with usually only one or two options on the menu, this is a very welcome change!). Their commitment to serving GMO free, organic, local sourced ingredients was icing on the cake. If you are in Cleveland or anywhere close, by all means GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I had  heard mixed reviews on this place, so we decided to check it out.  Wow.  The service is terrible.  The food is nothing worth returning for.  
We dined late afternoon and sat at the bar.  I ordered a blueberry and citrus vodka cocktail that had basil in it; sounded and looked delicious!  Unfortunately, i felt it needed more citrus, so when the bartender asked me how it was I told him exactly that.  What did he do? Nothing. He said I probably didn't like it because it had basil in it (not true, not what I said to him) then, just walked away.  He didn't return to us until it was time to give us a bill. (The bar had 6 other patrons, not busy).  The drink, that remained untouched, was on the bill.  I told him that if he had offered lemon wedges to make it more citrusy, I would have loved it!  I was disappointed that he didn't offer to fix the drink, but instead ignored us and then charged me for it!  
On to the food- I started with the house salad with the Townhall dressing.  The salad was a mescaline mix with 2 cherry tomatoes, 1 crouton, and tossed with olive oil. The turkey club followed, halfway frozen deli meat. No thanks.
After checking with my friends that said this place was great, they said they had never eaten here, and that they always went here late night for drinks. So, maybe that's all this place should be considered good for."}
{"text":"Townhall is one of favorite restaurants. Every time I go there I try something different and the food is ALWAYS amazing. 

My only complaint is that the last time I went I tried the scallops and I was very disappointed. When our server put down my plate I almost told her that I did not order an appetizer because that's how small the portion was. There were 4 scallops and about 2 tablespoons of spaghetti squash. There is no possible way that without ordering an appetizer that dish would satisfy your hunger. After I ate my scallops I had to order an appetizer, as I was still hungry. 
I've tried the many of the \"proper plates\"  and they have always been great portions, but the roasted diver scallops have no business being in that section. I recommend they be added to \"shareables\".
With that being said, they were the most delicious scallops I've had and they were cooked PERFECTLY."}
{"text":"Went here last week for lunch during the workday.  The atmosphere at this place is phenomenal - large and wide open with a great patio.  The service on the other hand...  It seemed as if the waitress just wasn't paying attention or didn't care.  It took approximately an hour and a half from the time we arrived until we could leave.  Each time the waitress left our table it was at least fifteen minutes before she came back.  Our food was brought out maybe five minutes after we ordered by a kitchen server who didn't ask if we needed anything - just dropped it off and left.  My order was wrong which, combined with the quick arrival of the food, makes me wonder if we were brought somebody else's order.  Since our server didn't come by for about fifteen minutes after the food arrived, I just ate what I had been given.  Afterwards, I had to wait for about five minutes while our waitress stood nearby chatting to another customer about beer styles before we could ask for the check.  When she next returned to the area I was holding the check clearly ready to present it.  Rather than come take the check, the waitress spent about five minutes slowly cleaning a large table and chatting with a co-worker.  It was unreal.  The place was admittedly busy, but servers should have the awareness that patrons in dress clothes arriving for lunch on a weekday cannot afford to spend an hour and a half at a restaurant."}
{"text":"The hype is a 10/10 for this place.  My overall dining experiance was a 6/10.

The Good:  Beer selection is AWESOME, fun cool drink menu. Kobe beef is out of this world and has a solid food selection.

The Bad:  Waitress took dinner orders from 2 people in our party, then walked away, came back 15 min later to take dinner orders for the other 6 people in our party. Odd to say the least.  The homemade \"frites\" or fries tased like dry wood with no salt, horrible and unedible.

Overall this place is fun and always packed. Fun to hang out and have a few drinks, but some of the foos was underwhelming...but it has potential.  Will give it a second chance."}
{"text":"- slow service - 20 minutes to get the bill after we asked
- the wait staff doesn't know enough about the menu. They need to try more of the food so they can better recommend items
- Unorganized; four items (2 separate times) were brought to our table that were meant for another table. I know they've only been open for a month, but get it together.
- tiny bathrooms, like crazy tiny for the size of the place
- long wait, kind of; they said it would be an hour for the four of us on a Saturday but it ended up being 25 minutes. Thumps up! 
- just ok food. It lacked in flavor. With all the restaurants on west 25th, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Well you clearly cannot order take out since they hang up and put you on hold several times and occasions"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I visited Townhall for Saturday brunch and were pleased to have quickly found seats at the bar. Unfortunately, that's where Townhall peaked.

We both started with coffee: an orange mocha for me, brewed for her. Easy, right? Her coffee arrived quickly, but upon requesting sugar she was informed by the bartender that they're \"out of sugar.\" Yes, you read that correctly: out of sugar. At 10:30AM. During Saturday morning brunch service. 86 sugar. Rolling with the punches, she decided to take advantage of Townhall's much ballyhooed cold press juices and ordered an \"El Greengo.\" Five minutes later we were (again) informed that they were \"out of El Greengo.\" Oh, and my orange mocha is still MIA.

The orange mocha finally arrived -literally- 25 minutes after ordering. The best part? It came in a to-go cup that was only 3/4 full, and it tasted like someone got frustrated and finally brewed some coffee, added a pump of chocolate and some orange syrup, and called it a day. The bartender removed it from my bill, but only after offering a long-winded explanation (read: excuse) as to why I didn't merit an actual coffee mug (too much breakage) and the exorbitant wait time (the barista was in a car accident), because I care. I don't, I just wanted my damn coffee. Accidents happen, but good management knows to have employees on-call during peak periods or, worst case scenario, management jumps into the fray themselves so that customers don't suffer.

Our food experience fared no better. I've never seen an egg cooked to gray before, but that's exactly what my fiancee got on her Eggwich. It looked like the frozen-then-microwaved egg patty used by a popular fast food chain, and not the freshly-prepared over-easy egg that she was expecting. My shrimp street tacos arrived incorrectly prepared, and by the time they arrived back to me my fiancee had finished as much of her Eggwich as she could stand. 

One upside: Henry, the bar-back. That man was easily the hardest worker in the place and was incredibly pleasant when he could sense that we were not pleased with our experience. I hope management at least recognizes a good employee when they see one. Meanwhile, other employees were leaving dirty dishes on the bar directly next to my fiancee as she ate her meal. Possibly a health code violation, and definitely gross.

We won't waste another meal at Townhall. Plenty of vastly superior brunch spots within short walking distance - try SOHO instead."}
{"text":"So we came in and gave our name - 20-30 minute wait- and after 40 minutes I went to check on why we weren't seated yet and they lost our reservation - granted the girl remembered me so we were seated in 5 minutes but next to an door that opens to the outside constantly and then we couldn't order from the menu due to a break between brunch and dinner menu. Wasted time eating appetizers 


*** update - manager came to my table and apologized and paid for our meal, gave us gift cards and now a skillet cookie!  Not sure if they saw my review but I am impressed with their response"}
{"text":"Townhall is pretty great. I'd been avoiding it for a while because it was always crowded and looked like a trendy burger joint.  We ended up going with a group of friends and I was extremely pleasantly surprised.  It was trendy, but in a nice way.  The menu had an awesome variety including a vast number of vegan options.  I'm not a vegan, but I prefer to eat like one.  They had tons of interesting sounding beers, fresh juices, good coffee. Of course, my husband ordered the most boring IPA on the menu so I didn't get to try anything cool--but I will be back.

I ordered one of the noodle bowls.  DELICIOUS.  So flavorful, not overly salty, lots of food.  I asked for it without meat and it was not without meat.  No big.  Our server (as she was handing it to me) noticed there was meat in it and offered to go get me another one.  I told her not to bother and just gave the pieces of meat to Beardyman.  I would have appreciated more vegetables in the dish, but it was really very good. 

Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed their food. I ate half of Beardyman's fries because they were just divine.  We will definitely be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"We arrived about 5:40 PM on a Saturday, expecting a wait. The place was packed, including the patio. We were seated immediately inside, and our waitress was very attentive (unlike previous reviews we read). When our candle/lamp ran out of fuel, it was replaced before the smoke cleared! With both the front and back entrances open, and ceiling fans, the \"wind tunnel\" effect caused paper napkins to fly off the table. It's also very noisy.  It looked like a large beer menu, and lots of non-alcoholic options, including fresh juices. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan choices, and enough for the carnivores, too. Food came very quickly. My chicken curry noodles bowl was yummy...the curry flavor was just strong enough. The chicken was moist and tender. The veggies (carrots, cauliflower and pea pods) were raw - not a big deal, but blanching would have been nice. Grilled cheese bars with veg chili were good (chili was a bit salty) - would get it again. Had time to kill before a concert, so we ordered skillet cookie with Mitchell's ice cream. Cookie was almost cake-like and still 
warm in baking pan. Definitely too big for one person...we didn't finish it. Stop in when you're in the neighborhood...not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"The next word could describe this place - Okay.

I am occasionally visiting the Townhall for lunch, but the last couple of times has left a few disappointing things such as EXTREMELY slow service and very noisy atmosphere. Moreover, since it became colder, some people (not always potential customers) are using the corridor-shaped dining hall as a free short-n-warm way between 25th and 24th Streets.
Maybe that was the idea, but I don't like when doors have the speed about five openings per second (it is winter, at least), and lots of strange people are passing by my table..."}
{"text":"This place deserves its positive reviews. Some info about its lay-out: in addition to a nice sidewalk patio area, the restaurant's divided into 2 sides. The same menu is used on both sides but, facing the restaurant, the left side (with the beautiful bar) offers waited-table service, with staff to seat you, take and deliver orders, refill beverages, etc. The right side--again, same menu--is walk-up service: you place your order at the counter and you're given a number to display on the table of your choice. Soft drinks and water are self-serve, but bar and other menu items are brought to your table. 

Regarding the menu, it's short, but every item seems done right, from the more casual fare to the higher-end entrees. Milkshakes are made with local Mitchell's ice cream and a plop of well-chosen alcohol to complement each flavor.

Definitely the kind of place you return to, bring out-of-town guests to, and tell your friends about."}
{"text":"3 stars are not for the food ( which by the way is great and accommodates all different tastes and dietary expectations), 3 stars are given to the serving team. They are all efficient but give impression that they hate what they are doing and where they are. Place has a gloom and doom atmosphere even though it has a great decor. 
Servers to not connect with you in any way or form, total lack of personalities. 
A little smile would \"go a long way\" in this place."}
{"text":"My coworkers like to order lunch from this place, and the couple of times that I ordered something were very disappointing-bland at best, and when they manage to make something with any flavor at all, they don't go together (blue cheese in tomato bisque-no thanks!)  However, I was dragged here for someone's birthday recently, and was so annoyed by the place that I am writing my first and only restaurant review ever.

I will start by saying that the only good thing I can see about this place is the beer selection.  However, that is no longer a novelty, and you can go anywhere on 25th (or elsewhere, for that matter) and get a good beer.

The bad:

1. The cocktails are weak and overpriced

2. The food is TERRIBLE.  Absolutely the worst I've had in a long time.  I cannot understand any of these reviews that claim the food is great-have you eaten at a restaurant before?  

I ordered the chicken tacos, and they consisted of unseasoned chicken (literally), with some random carrots and cabbage (huh?), flavorless cheese (how does that happen?), and mashed avocado.  They called it guacamole, but it wasn't.  Guacamole has more than one ingredient.  All with a tiny side of what appeared to be  salsa from a jar.

My fiance's Thai peanut whatever mess that he ordered was just as bland, was a tiny portion in a huge bowl, and took 20 minutes longer to come to the table than my tacos, which leads me to

3. The service here is SLOOOOWWW.  We were with a large party, but even so, it wasn't great.  The waitress was nice enough, but drinks were slow to come out.  Also, there was another person in our party whose food came out late, and they were given a gift card to make up for it.  My fiance with his late, tiny, bland bowl of pseudo-Thai hipster gruel?  Not even an apology.

It's ok, though, because if we got a gift card we wouldn't be back anyway.  The super contrived hipster vibe is off-putting enough to keep us away, and the food seals the deal."}
{"text":"The new fall menu is great, especially some of the new fall drinks! And you have to love a dog friendly place!"}
{"text":"Great bar!  It was jam packed, but service was attentive and immediate.  Bartenders let me sample things and helped me pick out what I wanted.  Prices were great.  I'll def go back again."}
{"text":"Had Brunch it was great! First time to have the brunch and was not disappointed. I ordered the Full Monty, delicious organic breakfast. I also ordered the house made biscuits with cinnamon butter and preserves they were so yummy! My sister ordered the OHC Benedict and Truffle fries she really enjoyed her food. Everything was amazing! It does get very busy don't be surprised if you have to wait to be seated. They were quick with the seating though, we were told about 45 minute wait however we were sat in about 30 minutes. Also, they text your phone to let you know your table is available that was nice so in case you want to walk around while waiting for your table you can. Our server Hollace was great, very attentive!! Wonderful experience, I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Townhall is a great place for having a beer or having a great lunch. It is price comparing to other restaurant that you could find around the Ohio City Area. The atmosphere is fun, exciting and full of energy. Totally recommend if you are down in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Some of the most oblivious service I have ever seen in a bar, but also the fastest rotating and one of the least expensive beer lists in Cleveland. $5 beers all the time, serving size varies according to keg price mostly it seems. Nice whiskey list for Cleveland at amazing prices (generally $3/oz or $6/2oz). Typical w25th crowd, bro."}
{"text":"Great food and fresh juice selection. Nice atmosphere and good service. Pleasantly surprised every time I go.  Great addition to Ohio City."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth checking out, especially if you are vegan or have vegan friends or family. Monday Night has many meatless specials and $3.00 draft beers. Their burgers are great too! The service is outstanding, really over the top. The waiters and waitresses go out of their way to make your time there special. It is a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere and the food is all very pleasing to the eye. Huge portions, well priced and of course, delicious! I was very happy with my overall visit to Town hall Cleveland. I may have a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I have been to Townhall three times now and I am never disappointed. I'm a very tough critic because I have spent a lot of time downtown Chicago, but I can honestly say that this place makes me feel like I'm in Chicago. Great food, great beer, and the atmosphere is modern yet cozy. The brunch is awesome too (we had a table of 8 and everyone loved their meals and drinks!). I will be back for sure next time I'm in Cleveland again :)"}
{"text":"Great place for any event!  I have been here many times for different events.  This past Saturday was my friend's bachelorette brunch with several girls.  Not only did they give us the perfect table on the patio, but they added a little touch with a complimentary dessert.  The brunch menu was delicious and healthy!   It was a fun atmosphere and the service was flawless.  When we walked in the door we were greeted with a smile and our server was on top of food and drinks!  I recommend Townhall for any event especially when you have guests in from out of town!"}
{"text":"Really nice facility, and the food is great. But don't expect any room to breathe or walk if you go here on a weekend night, it's over crowded and it takes FOREVER to get a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been here before for a few drinks and once even had a few appetizers at the bar. The place is always busy, which is a good sign, but I prefer to judge for myself. Tonight we came in and the place was rather busy as usual, but folks were fighting for the outside tables, so we took the first available. We were seated in 10-15 minutes inside, they removed some squatters from our table to give us the seat - bravo! Once we were seated, Taylor our waitress came a greeted us. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and on top of things all night long... outstanding! The food was delicious, I had the Bangkok Bazaar Bowl and my friend had the Thai Peanut Bowl. Both were fantastic! We enjoyed great beer with great food and great service, what else can I say. The only problem I've had (in the past) is getting a seat in this place because it is so good. If this place weren't so popular and I could get a seat every time I visited, it would be nirvana. I'd give it six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, positive and energetic atmosphere, and happy and friendly staff. What more can you ask for in a restaurant? I'm not the biggest Yelper, but since I already strongly recommend Townhall to all my family and friends, I figured why not share my love for this restaurant with the general public! Trust me when I say, Townhall will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like Townhall, however it's time to give up.  After visiting for brunch 4 times, the service has been consistently poor, slow, orders have been wrong, food comes out at uneven intervals and more often than not - cold.  Mother's Day was the last straw.  After calling to make a reservation, likely this would be a busy day, we were told sorry we do not take reservations.  Ok, we will come anyways and take our chances.  When putting our name in we were asked if we had a reservation.  Really?  After we called 3 weeks ago and were told they don't take them?  Really a bummer because the location is great, cool interior and great menu.  But the rest is meh at best."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! I was more than pleased with my experience at Townhall. Even though we came on a Wednesday night, this place was packed! Our wait was not very long despite how insanely crowded it was. Our server was very attentive and quick despite how busy  it was. You can tell they are all about quality here at Townhall, as every little detail was very high quality. I ordered the tacos with vegan chicken, which were amazing! Though I am not vegan/vegetarian, the chicken was just as good - if not better, than regular chicken. The food was incredibly fresh and had a lot of flavor all around. 
The best part about Townhall is their menu. They can cater to just about anyone's diet. My friend who has a severe allergy to nuts was given her own customized menu so she was ensured to be taken care of. The menu breaks it down for you how each item can be made - whether it be gluten free, vegan, etc. I find it awesome that this place goes out of their way to take care of those with special diets and have such great service as well. It is an overall fantastic experience coming to Townhall, and you also leave knowing that you ate a very healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Decided on Townhall tonight with my friends, was greeted by the hostesses and was seated immediately. Great comfortable crowd with an ever changing draft beer list. The waitresses were very friendly and helpful. The best place in Ohio city for food, beer and good times. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland! Love the concept. Wish there were more restaurants like this. And the food is awesome! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch. So many vegan, gluten free, and non dairy options...but also tons more options if you eat anything, like me."}
{"text":"Stopped by after class late on a Tuesday. Id planned on a margarita and a couple tacos at barrio but decided to try somethin new. It was packed and horribly loud, I couldn't hear my waitress and she couldn't hear me. I asked what was good drink and food wise, she just said its all pretty good and didn't divulge into much more info on either food or drink. I settled on the drink mauve. It's not too bad but it could be bigger. They have that gigantic block of ice in your drink taking up the entire glass much like that of drinks I've had at Hodges- I have to admit I like Hodges Raspberry thyme drink much better than this. I ordered the simple salad and the rotisserie chicken truck tacos. The simple salad is just that- simple. Literally just fancy lettuce and croutons. The vinaigrette on the salad was really good but my lettuce taste like it was never washed and the croutons were no longer crunchy- stale like. A lil red onion and halved petite  heirloom tomatoes (and crunchy croutons) would've made this salad amazing!
The tacos we're horrible! The cabbage is pickled or something and gave the tacos a seafoody type flavor- it was weird and lacked that cabbage \"crunch\". I couldn't eat it and literally scraped it all out.The chicken was flavorless. Had aioli, cheese, and guac (the guac was the only thing I liked). I could barely eat it. It needs a texture. All its contents are soft- shell, cabbage, chicken, cheese, guac... Its needs some heat and crunch! Maybe a fresh cabbage slaw and some type of spice added to the chicken after shredding.
Needless to say, I left disappointed and honestly, still hungry. I grabbed a happy meal on the way home."}
{"text":"I went to town hall this weekend for the first time. The building is beautiful. The bar is a very cool rough hewn wooden bar that sticks out in spots, which was unusual but cool. 

They have a great beer selection, and the draft board looks like a retro bulletin board. It seems that they update their beers pretty regularly. Our menu said that it was effective as of 8:20 AM the day before. 

I ordered the grilled cheese with soup. I chose to add bacon, and it was excellent. I really enjoyed the tomato bisque. My girlfriend got the tofu bowl. 

Everything was very good, and our service was excellent. My only complaint was that there was a wedding party in there taking pictures on a busy Saturday. They were constantly asking us to move out of the way.  And none of the employees seemed to know what was going on.  I hate to be the guy who hates on someone's good wedding vibes but the whole thing was just really weird. 

Obviously that's a one time occurrence. I look forward to going back. The food was excellent, but the weirdness kind of ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"I keep coming back!!! The food is perfectly flavored and so many things to try and love what they stand for. There are some cool drink choices to try and the atmosphere is cool with indoor/outdoor options. The ONLY thing that always has me hesitant when I do have it in my list of options is the service. Every single service person I've had no matter location, day, or time they are either ignoring you or the face looks like they hate life until they \"have\" to talk to you then they put on a fake smile that quickly goes away once they turn around. The only downside I'd have to say but a big one to me. Everything else, I really enjoy."}
{"text":"First  visit to Town  Hall  We cannot wait to go back. Great experience. Freshness, temperatures, service all five star.  Met for the first time GM Ryan. Sharp young man. Continue the great work."}
{"text":"Popular and trendy place. Very clean with great atmosphere, especially during the summer. Sit at the back patio for views of the downtown skyline! I haven't found a dish I absolutely love, but all of the food is high quality and locally sourced."}
{"text":"Above average food. Prices fair. Menu is varied and you will be able to please the entire party."}
{"text":"Townhall hands down has the best butter coffee. 

Hard to compete with their brunch game, they absolutely kill it. 

I'd eat here everyday for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night if I could."}
{"text":"Great health conscious menu. Love that it's organic & non GMO. Friendly staff that is very knowledgeable. The brunch is a must try & is kid friendly. Great job town hall. See you soon"}
{"text":"After posting my initial review, I was offered the opportunity to talk about my feedback with the management of Townhall. We discussed a few of the menu items, how they look for new ways to improve their menu, currently decide how new items make the menu along with some strategic ways that these changes could be handled differently.  

After a month had gone by I checked in to see if anything had come from my feedback.  I was told some things were in motion, but in the meantime that improvements had been made to the flatbread. So I decided to sneak over during a busy lunch hour and try it out.  It's improved.  The crust is better, and it can support the weight of toppings on it.  I'm not sure that I like it as much as the original version, but it's clear that improvements are being made.  

I've updated my rating by a star.  I'm still curious to see if any other changes are planned, so I may revise this further in the near future.

I'm leaving my original 2 star review below.

This has been one of my regular spots since it opened. I walk here one to two times a week.  It has a lot going for it.  The facility is large when compared to other spots on the near west side.  The bar staff has always been amazing.  Their hours are great.  It's just steps away from my house.  I can usually bring a book to read or my laptop if I need to finish working on something without issue.

With that said, I am about to give up on Townhall. I can't take the constant experimentation with the menu.  Items that were good like the basil fried rice disappear in the middle of the week.  And even when it was on the menu, it would be prepared a little different each time I would order it.  One day the rice is white.  Next day it is red.  Hmm, what is this crunchy thing in here this time?  And why does my tongue burn?

Like one of their smoothies?  That will be gone soon, so don't get too attached.  I stopped ordering them because of the change. The last one I tried tasted like a ground up pine tree car air freshener.  But Chelsea recommended it, and whatever she recommends I'm at least trying.  

The flatbread pizza was amazing.  Now?  The crust is terrible and it isn't even strong enough to hold the toppings without flopping over in your hand.  You know it's bad when one bar tender knows exactly why you dislike it, and another admits to getting pizza from the bar across the street.  Does the kitchen not even test their changes before implementing them?

The egg sandwich for brunch?  Changed. But you have to read the ingredients, because items like this will keep the same name but will be suddenly significantly different (important for people with food allergies - don't assume it's the same!!).  Portions change too.  Like the milkshake.  They used to make the shake and give you the mixing tin along with the glass.  Now you just get a glass, effectively cutting the serving size in half.  The burger seems smaller these days too.

Now maybe this is all done in their quest of being 100% anti-gmo.  Personally I dig science, but if being anti-gmo is their thing that's cool.  But I go out to eat quality food prepared in a consistent and predictable manner in a comfortable atmosphere, not to be anti-gmo.  So if that means I need to eat GMO elsewhere for the sake of consistency so be it."}
{"text":"The food is not bad at Town Hall, but after a certain hour on weekends, it's just too crowded to deal with unless you're really just looking to drink (which is totally fine and the clientele seems to be among the best looking on Cleveland... Seriously, where did all these hot people come from?). I think they have a lot of staff turn over because of the four or so times I've eaten there, I've had trainee servers I think three times and so the service is a little uneven. The last time I was there, I had to send back my meal because there was a hair in it, but the staff was quick and courteous about it and they didn't charge me. Those kinds of things can happen anywhere- it all depends on how it's handled and they did great. Also, $3 drafts on Monday. That's a definite pro."}
{"text":"Great beers, great food, not so great crowd! I wish more people avoided this gem! I love it, but hate it! The food, service, and drinks are great, but the crowd makes it horrid! Go when it's slow and enjoy yourself but get out before all the club kids come!"}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that I've never really gone out with friends here and had to get drinks at the bar.  I have heard bad reviews from my friends about service at the bar late on weekends.  Most likely because the place is packed.

I've gone for dinner three times and brunch twice.  I have yet to have something I didn't like enough to eat everything on my plate.  I highly recommend their guac, nachos, burger, chicken dinner and eggs Benedict.  I know that seems like a strange mixture of things but they were delicious!

We had a group of 15 here for the night before my sisters engagement party (she lives out of town and was in with her fiance and his family).  They accommodated us even though they don't take reservations on the weekend by one of us getting there early.  This was in October and was really nice out so we got the big table outside and had great service."}
{"text":"I have wanted to like Townhall so much more than I do. 
The decor is great--whoever laid-out the space has a great understanding of cohesiveness, walkability, and design. 
The food is...average. There is nothing special, which makes the menu feel a bit overpriced. You'll see all of your standard staples (perhaps too many) like flatbreads, tacos, sandwiches, etc, but nothing really stands out.
The atmosphere is loud and a little BRO-ey, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"The food is way below average, I've been twice and each time it was over cooked. After the second experience I spoke directly w/ the owner. It didn't go well. He essentially told me that I was wrong. He rolled his eyes on 2 occasions while completely dismissing me. I wasn't rude, over aggressive, or asking for a refund/discount. Obviously, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time there, and I will go back.  I did not eat here, so if you need food review skip along to another review.  The place was very busy (Friday night in a downpour), and had a crowd full of nice looking ppl. and men in particular.  My wine was $10 for a house wine.  WTF!   
     The wait staff....OMG!  Not so great.  Here is what happened to me:  I happened to be sitting at a table with 3 other ppl.  These 3 ppl. ordered drinks, and I didn't order a thing.  I also had an open tab at the bar (which I paid!)   The 3 drinks arrived, and the waiter brought a merlot that was supposed to be a Miller.  Well, the 2 guys left the table sans Miller, and left the merlot.  I finished my chard and since the drink went without a drinker for 10 minutes, and decided to claim it...they are $10, you know.  
So, my group decides to leave this place for dancing.  I was accosted by the floor manager for not paying that bill! The entire bill for these 3 ppl.  I tried to explain...blah blah blah.  Luckily, my friend was able to get this guy to listen, and we got off the hook. 
     If you go here, make sure the waiters know exactly  who ordered drinks and who is paying!    They will hound you otherwise.  It was humiliating.  
   Why go back...I'm tall and there was a fine collection of tall men for my eyes to feast upon...just being honest!"}
{"text":"A great Ohio City staple that is NOT owned by the Great and Powerful Oz...errrr, McNulty.

-Great beer selection, friendly bartenders and servers, small but well rounded menu, and it's beautiful inside! The interior is very Cleveland; metal, wood, cozy but not anything like a grandma's living room. Perfect.

This is a great place for a weekday date."}
{"text":"The food is always phenomenal! I am a vegetarian .. So TH has tons of options for me! The server Corey was seriously amazing .. She was so engaged and on top of things! Always a good experience at TownHall!"}
{"text":"From beginning to end, the meal was amazing. Chef Erik Roth did a wonderful job developing the menu, and it was a fantastic birthday lunch. The lettuce wraps were light and a perfect start to the meal. My husband had the Thai bowl, and I had the tacos, both of which were beyond expectation. Our waittess, Morgan, was very knowledgeable and suggested food and beer pairings. She also brought us samples of beers she thought we'd enjoy.... and we did! I highly recommend trying the house infused beer at the time....right now it has cactus pear in it!  Pricing was definitely affordable. We will definitely be coming back in the near future. Personally, I would choose to come here over other name brand restaurants in the area, hands down."}
{"text":"Thank you for making my birthday brunch so great! The 12 of us enjoyed all of the drinks, and brunch! The food was fresh, tasty and i highly suggest the lite bright bowl as well as the truffle fries. I think after one can of truffle fries the group ordered five more. Our server was so friendly and always had a smile on her face! I am also in the restaurant industry so i feel like i could be a bit more critical but she was spot on. As well as the hostess who were so nice. Brian had a cabana for the 12 of us! Perfect fit! We will be back soon. I am so happy some of the people in my group have never been to town hall before because i know now they will be returning guests! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been to TownHall several times--a couple times to eat and once or twice while bar-hopping. 

The food is very good, and I've always been impressed with the beer selection. It's the service that I'm iffy about. Every time I've gone in there, the waitresses and hostesses have not been friendly. For whatever reason, they seem annoyed to be there. And hey, that's fine, not everyone is over the moon about his/her job, but a smile is nice every once in a while. I can look past that if the food and wait time is good, which it is at TownHall.

As far as nightlife goes, you've got your typical frat boys and twentysomething girls. The last time I was there for a night out, there was an unusual amount of creepy drunk dudes, so if that's your scene, TownHall is the place to be."}
{"text":"------update from second visit on June 4th 2016------
the restaurant contacted me and asked for a second chance. It's been about 3 years since my first review, so probably a lot had changed. To be clear, they offered me a gift card to come back and try them again

Stopped in there today around 1:30 and the place was packed.  I sat at the bar and was just one person, so can't really make a judgment call on table service.  I will say the bartenders were very busy but they were friendly, quick to serve and very attentive despite that.  There were only one or two open spots at the bar.  The food was good.  I had the order of 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas.  Unlike a lot of other places, the corn tortillas didn't soak all the way through and come apart by the time I got to the last one.  They were pretty wet at the bottom, but still held together.  Served with an order of home made tortilla chips and some salsa.  They also had some sort of Mexican flavor I recognized as authentic from my trips to Mexico but couldn't put my finger on what it was.  On the way out I cruised by the crepe station.  They looked pretty awesome.  Apparently at least on Sat. afternoon they have that going all afternoon.  You walk up, look at all the great selections of stuff they have out in small bowls on the table to put on your crepe and they will make it up to order.  Bottom line, I would go back again based on this experience.  In addition to their beer list being quite extensive they had 3 flavors on nitro. 



-------------
old review from 2013 - was at 2 stars then
------------
Stopped in this new place for a couple of drinks this afternoon. Cocktails were pretty mediocre, kind of watered down tasting. Service was a little frosty too. Other people's food looked good (entres), but the cupcake and bar nuts (croutons and sugared nuts) were pretty meh.
the shakes looked pretty killer though.
To the other reviewer that says this is as good as it gets in Cleveland, go across the street to the Beer Markt (we drive up from Buffalo just for the sunny side pizza and amazing beer menu) or down the street to the Black Pig. The Flying Fig also has much better cocktails than here.
The decor and vibe are really nice though."}
{"text":"Update 1/2017:  After hearing from management about my review, they offered to have us come back.  We have gone back twice since and I can tell the feedback has been addressed.  Our service had greatly improved along with the food.  We are very happy as we love the bar atmosphere.  

Heard this was a great restaurant/bar so we decided to check it out on a Saturday evening.  We immediately loved the look of the place as we found a spot at the bar.  The ambiance, decor, and lighting was perfect.  We were pleasantly greeted by the bartender who explained the beer selection and offered great advice.  We placed our order.  Ten minutes later half of order comes and the bartender asked if we needed anything else.  I informed her we were waiting on the other items.  She happened to deliver those exact other items to a patron (who ordered after us) when she delivered half of our order.  I asked if that was our food and she said that person ordered the same thing.  Kinda odd that we didn't get our whole order together.  So another fifteen minutes go by and the other half of our order arrived.  I kindly asked her if it is normal for an order to arrive separately and she said that they were just waiting on something for this dish.  Unfortunately, that is not restaurant protocol and she should of just told the truth.  It was obvious it was a mistake.  My friend didn't want to eat until I had my food so it was just awkward.  Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday.  We walked in the right side, not realizing that was the cafe area.  Not one of the people who worked there, who were just standing around looking bored behind the counter, thought to dispel our confusion and point us the way to the hostess stand.  

We sat on the front patio, which was nice, aside from the street person harassing us for money.  I had the turkey club, which was okay.  The fries were pretty good.  My bf had the burger with no bun and the salad with no croutons.  Unfortunately his plate came out with the bun and with the croutons.  Not a big deal though.  

The service was just forehead-slapping terrible.  I could tell our server was a nice person and meant well, but it was like she was perma-stoned.  Just really oblivious and forgetful about stuff we had to ask for: silverware, salt/pepper, giving us our check, picking our check back up, giving us boxes for leftovers.  

Overall, pretty disappointing for all the hype I've been hearing.  Maybe I'll go back and avoid that server by sitting at the bar, but I'll have to find someone else to go with me bc my bf is disgusted with this place."}
{"text":"Be careful when you walk in, you might step on a hipster.  This review is for the self-ordering side.  I have no idea how the service on the other side is.

My meal was excellent, and if that was all we ordered, this would be a better rated review.  I had the chicken tacos which were tasty and not greasy at all.  I'm typically not a huge chicken taco fan - fish, shrimp, beef or pork being more appropriate - but these were pretty good.  They use a flour tortilla.

Staff lacks knowledge as to their products.  One in our party had a dairy allergy and asked if the crepes could be ordered dairy free.  Yes we were told, but when we took the ticket up to the station, we were told by the crepe maker himself (is there some fancy French word for that?) that the mix had dairy in it.  Oh well.

Beer list is interesting but it took about a year and a half to get the beer to the table.  

The décor is inviting and charming and the place has a nice airy feel to it.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but not for a meal, and I might be inclined to see if it is a better experience with a server."}
{"text":"The Full Monty. My first taste of Town Hall fare ... wow. Perfect blend of colors (orange, green, red, white), textures and flavors: crunchy roasted brussels sprouts, creamy sweet potato puree, perfectly poached egg, soft beet hash, warm spinach, bruleed bacon. My daughter built her own sweet crepe, yet couldn't keep her fork off my plate.

Kickstarter Coffee, blended with grassfed butter, coconut oil is wonderful! (I make it at home and love that I can order it here). Daughter had the Fortitude smoothie, really refreshing!

Service was friendly, efficient - good. The place was packed, yet food came out swiftly. Lively urban atmosphere, upbeat vibe. Great variety on the menu - all interesting. Surprisingly fair pricing for such quality food. Worth the drive and wait.

100% GMO-free menu and NEO Foodies on Facebook brought me here. Can't wait to return and bring friends and family (so I can eat off their plates, too!)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice- once for brunch and dinner. Every time the food is wonderful, the service is fantastic and the ambience is amazing. There are a load of options- vegetarian, vegan, GF, paleo. This place is centered around eating healthy food that tastes fantastic! There are always neat additions to the menu- they had a new veggie bites addition the night I went. I split the truffle fries and had a whole zucchini pasta for dinner, and we were stuffed! We were seated outside, and it looks very pretty. Townhall is a great addition to the Cleveland scene, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor area with a lot of cute planter boxes around you , awesome fires with truffle oil but horrible terrible weird-tasting Zucchini Noddle ! Don't even consider it ..."}
{"text":"Lots of amazing beers at good prices. The beer menu is very well organized and they keep it up to date. The atmosphere is nice no matter where you sit. I think I might go there right now!"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and this is the restaurant and bar I go to every time I'm home. The food is absolutely incredible and the drinks are always on point. All the gluten free options are perfect and taste so good. The service is amazing. The atmosphere is fun and young yet respectable. I come here as much as I can for my twice a year visits. The only place I'll go."}
{"text":"We went to visit the restaurant in the beginning of June. The atmosphere was really nice and we were able to get a table outside. We have flatbreads, fish tacos and the Thai bowl which were tasty.
My only caution is don't use your credit card there. We are getting small random charges on our bill after a month. Take cash!"}
{"text":"Just straight up like this place. Beer selection and pricing is excellent. all food we have tried was great. Tacos, noodle bowls, steaks and brunch! All great. Great patio in summer and can't beat location. One of our go to spots on the strip."}
{"text":"Yeah, don't go here for food. Drinks are decent and the place is nice, just don't expect good food."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Alexandrea made it a great experience.  She described dishes Food was delicious.  Unfortunately we ate everything we ordered :). Wasn't able to take any home!!  Ambiance is great and food was fast and hot!  

We will DEFINITELY come back again and again!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to get me to come back to a place, having delicious food, a great tap list, and an attractive, friendly staff is a great place to start.,"}
{"text":"Visited Town Hall for the first time Sunday July 7 a place I drove by and thought I would like to go there and whelp I did.....love the atmosphere....our waitress Courtney was very friendly and fun.....I enjoyed my new found vodka OYO Stone Fruit (double of course) and the Thai Bowl, Kobe Cheeseburger, and simple salad were just absolutely DEELISH....I will definitely be back and you won't be let down when you do...so stop on by...you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place exists. I come here fairly often when I can escape hospital cafeteria food, which frankly is just not often enough. Of the things i've had, the Bombolotti is still my MVP. The scallops are also amazing. The pizzas are w/e. The burger is solid. 
I love their beer selection, it's inspiring. The interior is very welcoming and rustic and just modern but comfortable. I suppose other than the Pizzas, nothing else I've had here was anything less than satisfying. 
I know this place gets busy at nights and on weekends, but it's perfectly relaxing for lunch. I loved the back patio during the summer, so comfortable. This is a great place to come with a large group of friends as there is a lot of seating and some areas that can push together a lot of tables. Seems like a good place to get drunk."}
{"text":"have been to townhall several times.  each time i ask myself why am i here.  the answer is i am eating as a guest of someone who has not had great food.  the breakfast menu has some great sounding items, yet the served product is lacking both flavor and poorly cooked bacon!  lunch does not get better with the lack luster salads with wilted lettuce and bland rice bowls.  had cocktails and dinner here once and only once.  overdone burger and soggy fries. much better food to had in the ohio city area."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $11 for the smallest portions ever - get the late night tacos. Confirm the fries, so you don't get dished the chips and salsa. Not the servers fault.."}
{"text":"I visited Townhall for the first time today, I've been meaning to check it out for quite some time now. I have to tell you, I was very pleased! There's a young, attractive waitstaff, all attentive and super personable. The patio is beautiful! My friend and I spent a couple of hours out there enjoying the beautiful day with her 8 month old (very well behaved) son.  So, yeah, I would even go so far to call it \"kid friendly,\" assuming your kid isn't an a**hole. 
What I really dug is the diet-diverse menu. You could take anyone to eat there! Vegans, the Gluten-Free set, your buddy who just wants a good burger and some fries. I could even take my super picky, non-adventurous-eater husband. Nice beer list, nice cocktail list, and great juices and smoothies for those of us who, unfortunately, can't indulge in cocktails right now. (Thanks a lot, fetus!) 
I want to return with the aforementioned picky husband before I go all in with a 5-star review. I'll get back to y'all!"}
{"text":"Great food. Clean atmosphere. I've been to this place many times and often order take out because the food is so great. I can tell this establishment takes great pride in everything they do; from the way the servers present themselves to the fresh food items that are always served. 

When I do dine in, the service is so accommodating often offering me samples of beer to taste before choosing which to pair with my food. 

TH also has the best vegan menu in Cleveland - my favorite are the delicious vegan desserts. 

Overall townhall provides great food served by friendly people in a clean, beautiful environment - in fact I may have a Thai bowl for lunch today."}
{"text":"I was recently in town for a friend's wedding and stopped in this place for some food and drinks.  The moment I walked in, I was blown away by the decor and woodwork - this place has a cozy vibe, but yet very modern at the same time.  Would love to see what the patio is like when it's not a polar vortex out....  The staff and the service was amazing and loved my scallops - seared to perfection!  The other half of the place seemed to be more of a coffee shop and loved that as well - especially the board games for the patrons.  It is refreshing to find a place that is a little bit more focused on healthier food fare too.  The truffle fries and Thai bowl were ridiculous as well.  This was by far and away my favorite spot in CLE while visiting from LA.  Thanks for the great food, service, and hospitality!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have been doing brunch once a month, in order to get some \"us\" time in, away from boys and babies.  We met at this trendy little spot on a Saturday morning 11 a.m. or so.  The place was hoppin'.  The hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait, she was a young, sweet, nervous type, we waited less than 3 minutes.  She sat us on the back patio, under an umbrella with these large, orange cushioned, oversized wooden booth, next to a rock wall where the plants grow sideways. Again great for a group photo, or selfie.   I was immediately intrigued, and felt a little hip.  
     The menu was not your typical brunch menu, it seemed to incorporate Cleveland, Ethics, Green, and Healthier choices.  Anyway, they not only offered Mimosa's, but Mimosa's with grapefruit (yuk), which my healthy green friend Jen loved.  The food was actually really good.  Only downside was the waitress, she was outgoing and nice, but not super-attentive, it worked out for us ok though because we weren't in any rush, we wanted to spend the morning catching up.  
     I also noticed people were able to bring their dogs in, which I think is odd, but dog-lovers would be happy for, and it seemed kid friendly, maybe?  I saw a couple groups of people that brought a small child or two.  
   Bottom line, I'd for sure recommend this place for brunch on any sunny day in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stop along the way to Chicago:)Great pizza and cookie with ice cream:)) very nice place and waitress:)"}
{"text":"Food is fine.

Huge 0 for the service.I was there for 3 hrs only had 2 beers, because the waitress was forgetting my table's orders! Our bill would have been 4 times more if she paid more attention and did her job instead of just giving us attitude when we asked her about our beers!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessive about my food.  I cook most of my meals myself.  

Every so often, a special restaurant comes along that captures my interest.  TownHall is my current fascination.  Verging on an addiction.  There is something special about this place.  The extremely diverse clientele; The awesome servers;  The overall environment;   The awesome location in the heart of Ohio City;   The rock solid delivery of good food at reasonable prices, every time.

I work in Downtown Cleveland and start lobbying with my co-workers first thing in the morning about where we should do lunch. For the past several weeks, TownHall has been my choice.

This is difficult for me, as I'm mostly vegetarian.  I went out on a limb one day and tried the Kobe Burger at TownHall. There is something so special and so delicious about this burger.  This is a burger I dream about.  A burger  I constantly think about.  A burger I can't get over.  I've probably had 25 of them over the past several weeks, and each one is better than the last...I've been through a lot of single food fascinations over the years, but this fascination and enjoyment of the TownHall Kobe Burger has been one of the best ever...

TownHall.  To me, you are the king of Cleveland restaurants right now.  I know empires come and go, but for now, this place is THE SHIT.  Whomever envisioned and created this place and then put together the team that makes this place tick is a true culinary master and artist."}
{"text":"For someone who's from out of town and doesn't know his way around, I'm sure glad we found the Townhall. Service was amazing and the menu was diverse. Everything I tried was delicious. Glad we found this place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"There was about a 30 min wait for dinner, not too bad considering the area was packed in general and this restaurant seemed very popular. You can walk around the block some though and they give you a buzzer so you know when to come back. The food was good, we got two items and split both of them with leftovers. They have a lot of vegetarian options. The only thing that disappointed me was that they describe the restaurant as \"healthy\" but our food was very heavy and greasy. Good, but not healthy. The guacamole was amazing with goat cheese and other toppings, but beware that the chips are some of the greasiest chips I have ever had. There is a nice patio outside and a couple bar areas inside. They have TVs inside by the bars for people who like sports."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Cleveland! Love the chicken street tacos with fruit as the side. Delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"First time we went it was not very good. All of our friends continued to say that it was great, so randomly we decided to give it another try. Jess was our waitress and she did phenomenal, extremely better than our first experience. Food was very good. I got the lamb burger, and my wife the chicken nachos. Although they were busy the food came out in good time and drinks were always full. Very happy we gave it another shot!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, as always!  Had a tasty lunch with great service -- thanks to our waitress Taylor, she was awesome!   We will definitely be back.  I got the nachos and then harvest chicken salad.  Good combo of flavor and healthy."}
{"text":"Non-GMO, gluten free, vegan, huge beer list, great food, what more do you want? Eat here, drink here, now."}
{"text":"I'm glad I've given Townhall more chances! I feel like the service has gotten steadily better over time, and now that I've been diagnosed with celiac disease this place is a godsend! Nearly everything on the menu can be made gluten free and it's all really good. Plus they usually have a few good ciders available!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Townhall once to try their Veggie Burger. It was good but it wasn't great. The atmosphere is amazing though. This is definitely a great place for drinks and to hang with friends. Heck they even have a gaming station. I will definitely update my review once i've tried a few other things on their menu but I love that they have so many vegan and vegetarian options, which is something I am trying to do more of."}
{"text":"when it's good it's really, really good...
so, the beau and i have been here 3 times since they opened, and our number uno complaint? the staff. sometimes they are really, really amazing. super friendly! super helpful!  other times, they are just plain inconsiderate. like the girl who found it necessary to push her way past our table at least 5 times, each and every time her booty-short clad bottom was up against our table and basically in my flatbread. 
not exactly what i signed up for. 
it seems like when they're super busy the staff isn't quite sure what to do with themselves. there are those super focused servers who you know are trying to get it done, and then, there are the other servers. 
the food here is great! it's just what ohc needed, some good casual fair with a twist. the cocktails are interesting and have gotten better each time i've tried them."}
{"text":"There's a few things about this new restaurant that cause me to only give it 3 stars:

 One, I am completely turned off by the hostess service upon walking in. Each time I have gone I have not felt welcomed or greeted nicely by the hostesses. Instead, I stand there waiting for them to acknowledge that I'd like a table and they seem annoyed at doing their job. It's just a turnoff to me because I appreciate a welcoming, hospitable dining experience. It kind of makes me want to leave and go somewhere else when this happens. 

Secondly, I the first time I thought the meal was just okay. However, after trying it out a few more times there are good things on the menu. SO, the food is good. They have a nice selection of beers, neat cocktails, and adult milkshakes. The physical atmosphere is nice.

One time I sat and ate on the \"restaurant\" side and another time I ordered and ate on the \"juice\" side. My experience on the juice bar side was more positive than the restaurant side.

I do recommend checking it out. Although Town Hall isn't all that distinguished or uni"}
{"text":"Impressed by their food options which included many healthy items. 

As expected for Sunday brunch, the wait for two people around noon was 1.5 hrs! But there was self seating at the bar or in the cafe area, which worked out well for us - we ended up not having to wait too long. We just had to order from the counter and didn't really have waited service. 

We ordered Acai bowl and superfood Cesar with ahi tuna. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. 

I would say 5 stars for the foods I tried that day. Took one star off for the potential long wait if you want more of a restaurant experience rather than take out experience."}
{"text":"Town Hall is an exceptional place. I was expecting it to be like every other Ohio City establishment and I was overwhelmingly surprised that it was so much more. The venue is absolutely beautiful. Two patios, Enormous bar in and outside. Separate café for carryout or eat and run. Plus the also have a crepe bar.

I have been there 4 times all at different times. I had brunch the first time with several friends and ordered the Eggs Benedict which was amazing. They actually use real Hollandaise not some cheese sauce. The second time I went was for dinner. We all shared several items family style and though everything was really good, we all agreed that the flat breads and the Herb Crusted Chicken were AMAZING. 

It was nice to see and feel the energy of Town Hall. My servers have always been great and made me feel welcome. Though we had to ask for some things twice we all agreed it was new and they are still gearing up. 

Would absolutely recommend Town Hall to all to try."}
{"text":"Very surprised by how good and healthy the food is here, since it's a bar at night.  There can be a wait on Saturday's for brunch, but it's one of the better causal brunches around.  Cool patio in the back and outdoor seating in the front."}
{"text":"I wanted to not likeTown Hall because I thought it would be cheesy.  Turns out, it was so good! I went for brunch - the food was excellent and our server went out of her way to be nice.  One star off because the drinks there are really weak, but maybe worth it anyway as the juice was fantastic. A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My family came into visit from Las Vegas so I decided to make brunch reservations for Sunday. We arrived to a very packed place full of people. We were seated immediatly with no wait time. Our server was happy and ready to assist us and took our drink orders right way and offered some specialty cafe options. The crepe station was full of options with choices of savory to sweet so my mom ordered that and loved it!! I ordered the biscuits and gravy and one sweet potatoe pancake, it was delicious and the perfect portion. You can tell when you are eating the food that it is freshly prepared. I will definilty be ordering that again! The s. Potatoe pancake was soft and sweet; wonderful addition to my brunch. My family who came in from Vegas opted for a burger and fry and they said it was cooked to perfection and it came out at the perfect tempature and tasted incredible, they want to visit TownHall again when they come to Cleveland. I informed my server that it was also their anniversay and she surprised them with a fresh baked cookie with ice cream and sparkling candle. It was so thoughtful and complimentary. This visit sure did not fall short and I will be back again! Love Townhall and its amazing service and energy!"}
{"text":"Example of an establishment that has adapted to the changing food and beer scene. TownHall serves it hipster and yopro clientele well by providing excellent quality in an atmosphere that supports fellowship with other patrons. Grass fed burger is simple yet satisfying and beer selection impressive in spite of craft beer's ubiquity."}
{"text":"Went here as part of \"Beer Fest\". We got there at 8:20 (beer fest ran 7-10) and were told they didn't have any more beer for the fest. We asked if we could get another beer and were told no. We left and will never go back. 
We got an email the next day saying they found the second keg for beer fest people so we could go back on Monday. We didn't. We're done with this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's my second time here. This fast becoming my place of choice. The patio is great on warm days.  The tacos, the cheeseburger, the wrapped dates and the 2.0 salad were experienced over the course of the two visits and the food didn't disappoint. They also have a nice beer selection. On each visit the wait staff was very professional and friendly.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Good food , loved the griddle cookie but your ordering method sucks , I suggest going the Chilis route and have table top screens and order directly and pay from your table , this system that you have now sucks !"}
{"text":"I went with a friend here on Saturday about 2:30pm.  We sat at the bar and ordered a beer and asked for a lunch menu.  We were told they only serve brunch until 3 and then after that the lunch menu will be available.  We decided to wait until 3.  At 3 we asked several bartenders for the menu and finally one was brought over to us.  After deciding to order some guys next to us decided to order food as well and we overheard the bartender tell them they could not order lunch until 4.  They had a smaller menu with 4 items or so on it that you could order from and you could not order lunch at that time (???).  We asked the bartender why we could not order lunch at 3pm in the afternoon and he said he doesn't know why but the kitchen told him that they are not ready to serve lunch until later.....(which then would be considered dinner?).  It seems everyone working there isn't on the same page and with the numerous employees there everyone seemed to have a different answer to questions we asked.  We closed out our tab and went down the street to Market Garden and enjoyed food and then went to Tremont Tap House where we enjoyed the late afternoon on their patio.  Town Hall's look is nice but they need to get consistent and everyone needs to get on the bandwagon with consistent answers for being such a big space.  In this day, there are many other places to choose on 25th and in the downtown/Tremont/Ohio City area.  I have a feeling that 25th Streets \"beer alley\" atmosphere is going to get old soon.  There are so many beer specialty places around there it doesn't seem new or special anymore."}
{"text":"My friend and I had such a great experience at Townhall on Memorial Day! Shawna was the highlight of our trip here today! Everywhere else seemed too busy for us but Shawna made us feel special and welcome. Can't wait to come back and see her again. Fantastic bartender and person!"}
{"text":"This place actually tends to have pretty good food. But the service really crapped the bed on me tonight. 

Imagine walking into a restaurant and being offered a drink. I obliged. She tells me I need to open a tab, which isn't a problem but I tell her I was going to use a gift card. No sweat she assures me I can do that, but she still needs a card to open a tab. Hmm. Okay. Fine. 

So I give her my card. You can probably imagine where the story goes from here. Well, sort of. This server decides to abandon the entire side of the bar I'm sitting at. A different server (20 minutes after the first one disappeared on me) does the courteous thing and asks me if I needed a refill on my water and drink. I do.

I also had planned on ordering food, but the first server relieved herself of any duties after dropping off drink and water and swiping my card so I politely ask if I can order food from this server or if he wouldn't mind letting my server (at the opposite end of the establishment) that I was ready to order. No sweat he assures me. He can put in he food order. 

Really at this point I have no server. I have been passed off numerous times. After having eaten. And sat around aimlessly for a half an hour I grab the attention of the guy who put in my order. Excuse me but would you mind giving me the bill? 

Maybe this is my fault for not saying \"I want to use a gift card and pay for my bill\" or maybe it's just been an hour and half since the very first server reassured me that it wouldn't be a problem and in that lapse of time it has entirely become a problem. 

I'm finally able to flag down a new server who is willing to help me out (I assure you I sat patiently as plenty of servers went out of their way to avoid eye contact with me). She makes eye contact and goes out of her way to hear me out unlike everyone else I had experienced up until this point. This clearly frustrated her too. She needed a manager to override things and was visibly growing irksome of the inconvenience that this created. 

At the end of the day I felt like all of this could have been avoided if I hadn't been passed off numerous times. I was made to feel like I was being difficult by almost every server, even the one that ended up helping me when it was a situation created entirely by the staff's inability to even make any sort of eye contact or not be I such a rush to run off to anything else that I could have even edged a complete sentence out. It was poor service all around and everyone made ME feel like I was the problem. I was patient and courteous and still even tipped well above 30% gratuity... but somehow I left feeling like some sort of giant inconvenience. 

The good news is the food was tasty. Just no where near being worth the hassle and the lasting feeling that I was totally beneath my servers' time. 

What a lousy experience and what a terrible way to make someone feel who is helping support your business."}
{"text":"Always my first and last stop when out in Ohio City.  Great food and craft beer selection.  Love that they are always putting on events like movie nights, pumpkin carvings, build a ginger bread house.  

Awesome place to go any day of the week. Large staff and prompt service.  Enjoy frequenting for the food, craft beers, and atmosphere.   Would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat or drink in the area."}
{"text":"First time here.  Actually saw a couple go in and we followed. Being a Vegan hard to find places that serve food that doesn't have meat etc. 
I chose the Power 3.0 salad. 
Make sure to check the juices and smoothies out in the back of the menu."}
{"text":"Great spot! Friendly staff, cute decor, and lots of board games to keep you busy while you consume beer, bottomless coffee, or tasty food. There are vegan options abound - most things on the menu can be made vegan and there are vegan milk options for coffee drinks. It's the kind of place that I could see myself chilling at for hours."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was sadly disappointed. Their food was mediocre and the service was very slow. I did, however, like their decor and beer list."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite CLE restaurants! I especially love the Korean BBQ flatbread but I'm always pleased when I try new things. The fresh juices are wonderful- I love the grapefruit juice which is unsweetened and deliciously bitter."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, where juicing, non-GMO and organic are a standard. And I'll tell you what, LA can learn a lot from this place.

The juice, the coffee and the food are perfection.

Ordered the Nitrobru cold-pressed coffee, not realizing it was cold. Didn't matter. It was sensational.

Ordered the Green Juice. Flavor, texture, quality was top notch. Not always easy with greens, but they nail it.

And finally ordered The Full Monty. Best breakfast I've ever eaten in my life.

I am very sad I do not live close. I will miss this experience."}
{"text":"With so many great restaurants in Cleveland and with a short amount of time, it was very difficult to choose. My decision to visit Town Hall came down to quality, the diversity of food, beer options, and atmosphere.  

When we arrived, the place was already filled with great energy. All the servers and bartenders were very attractive. This is great for traveling business men who just got caught on Ashley Madison. You can look but don't touch.   Speaking of servers, my party of three men got the only male server that was there. Go figure right?  Jordan, Jordan is the guy to go to. He has great knowledge on anything you need to know regarding the menus and Cleveland in general.  Ladies, you should ask for Jordan. 

I started off with a beer name Revolution #10 and that was a great recommendation. I decided on the Lamb kefta burger with goat cheese.  Every bite was amazing. The fries were very well seasoned and not overwhelmed with salt. The Lamb Burger and the pale ale was a great combination. 
Town Hall was definitely the right choice to kick off my guilty weekend pleasure."}
{"text":"unfriendly, not helpful, BAD SODA, salty fries, long wait on food. Good burger and nachos, however nachos (chicken) seemed to have no chicken was very SMALL PORTION, but tasty."}
{"text":"Trendy and hip spot in Ohio City district. Bummer on the weekends too crowded in the tables get in the way of socializing. 

Attractive people great place to be seen Drinks average-- not anything to wow about. Bigger beer selection-- as that's it thing. Food-/ blah. Blan."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. Once for late night drinks and brunch. Brunch was absolutely amazing! I shared the eggwhich and sweet potato pancakes. Both were great! I could do without the Rosemary potatoes, they were bland and hard. But the pancakes were the best I have ever had. It comes with cinnamon butter and warm syrup. Too good to pass up! As for late night, drinks and service were great, but the flatbread we ordered was just average."}
{"text":"We rolled into Cleveland late but still needed to eat. The beer selection included local offerings but surprising their paella flatbread was awesome.

Our barman Kevin, a local, was very friendly and provided us with a great first welcome to the city. We've been on the road for the last three full days starting from the West Coast, so the hospitality was very much appreciated.

I sampled the Sunshine Daydream, from Ohio, and a roasted coffee flavored porter called the Peanut Butter Cup which was particularly delicious.

They stay open late and was crowded up until 12:00 or so."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday night and despite having a lot of people, we were served pretty fast. I can't quite remember what I ate but the milkshake was delicious."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stoped last night and it was packed for the game and we asked for a table and the second we said we had a dog with us they seated us at the tent section.Awesome!!! Our server was Rese i think (to drunk to remember the correct spelling) fantastic service and worth 30% tip. They have also a dog menu...What!!!!...we are moving to the west side and couldnt have a better welcome!!! Go townhall!!!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this restaurant.  I see that some reviewers found the combination of both beer and smoothies on the menu to be confusing, but I found it to be a refreshing difference.  I was there with a group of true beer lovers and I passionately despise beer, so I was happy to see plenty of options for non beer drinkers that didn't only include basic soft drinks.  I ended up getting a vanilla bean lemonade...the vanilla flavor sort of mellowed out the tart lemon and it was both interesting and delicious.  We all split a few plates of the prosciutto wrapped dates and they were amazing...again, another interesting combination of flavors that really worked.  For dinner, I had the grilled Nova Scotia salmon.  I asked for it to be cooked a bit rare in the middle and I got exactly what I asked for.  It was a beautiful piece of fish, cooked perfectly, and the accompanying mashed cauliflower was delightful.  Everyone I was with enjoyed their meals, too.  The service was great, as well.  Our server was super friendly and attentive.  I certainly think this place deserves a higher score than what it has on here based on my experience.  The food and service were both top notch, in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's aight. Kinda over-rated. Super irritated that my server didn't mention the gratuity being included on my check with my party of four...so I payed $25 for one beer & a weird pink burger, both paired with mediocre service. Oh well."}
{"text":"Town Hall is like the Grinch who stole Christmas. Only it's the mediocre overpriced restaurant that stole W25th. I'm going to sound a bit toothless and as if I'm sitting in a creaky rocking chair for a second: I miss the good old days of W 25th. Back when it still simmered a bit under the Cleveland radar, and where it was mostly populated on weekdays by chill alternative dudes and chicks at ABC tavern, older foodie couples at Flying Fig, and late night service industry folks at Bar Cento. 

The demographics of the scene have changed, and in my viewpoint monumentally for the worst. Now there's a giant influx on weekends of the types who like to show up in something neon at 9 PM and then puke up something neon at 12 PM. Town Hall is the epicenter of these folks, so much so that I swear they must be spawning them somewhere down in the basement. To show how much of a buzzkill this place is, I've noticed at least three or four extra uniformed cops hanging around the joint on late nights just to handle potential fights/drunken debauchery (and to be fair, it's also for the beer joints a few blocks down).  The force is treating the patrons here like they're teenagers at a school dance who need extra chaperones to dissuade extremely immature decision making. And for the most part, the police are right on that one.  

Do not come here if you want good food, fast service and a quiet atmosphere. This place is firstly, physically a huge space. And this huge space is not constructed with sound dampers, so noise tends to bounce around until it jumps directly into your ears and gets lodged there. Also, the people here tend to not be the biggest fans of the modest quietly enjoyed conversation. Very commonly a large group of tattooed 20-something bros who roll in here wishing to loudly regale their fellow beer-guzzlers with tales of their epic inebriation from two nights prior (translation: \"dude, I was so wasted I ate a Brussel sprout dipped in chocolate sauce last night!\"). 

If you like playing a drinking game of a shot every time you see a different baseball cap worn backwards, be warned you will get plastered fast in this joint. 
The staff seems to share my sentiments and actively dislike the crowd sometimes, so many servers wanly hover around the edges of the restaurant avoiding serving and avoiding eye contact. Service here is spotty at best. Orders routinely take inexplicably long, and by that I mean I once waited 25 minutes for my juice order to come out.  

But the most disappointing thing here is the food. I will tolerate just about anything if you feed me well, but this place makes my stomach frown. Firstly, the menu is one of the most aimless, confused, theme-less and obviously composed with a shrug menus I have ever seen. It reads like a hastily composed conglomerate of what your Grandpa thinks are the current trendy foods. Things called small plates that aren't really small plates? Check. Expensive truffle fries? Check. Overpriced juices for those of us thinking \"I really should start my diet sometime.......eff it, I'll just chug some kale to allow me to order this burger.\" Double check. Dessert of cookies, cookies or cookies because they were too lazy to hire a pastry chef? Yep. 

Also, dear menu-drafter, can someone please tell me what the heck is \"homemade milk\"?? I understand farm to table is trendy right now, but unless you personally milk a cow for every order of cookies that rolls through this place, what the heck am I supposed to take from that?
 
As for the execution of this food, it veers either greasy, bland or over salted. I can't really recommend any one dish, because dishes that are good one night are botched another. Servings tend to be big (even the small plates), so at least they will fill you up. 

TLDR; I swear I'm not normally this much of a grump. There's plenty of amazing places to eat on W 25th (Soho, Flying Fig, Bar Cento, Touch Supper Club) and this is simply not one of them."}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto. Stopped in around 10:30 am on a Sunday morning. 10 min wait for table, seemed we were lucky as the place was overfilling shortly after. Wife had the Wakey Wakey and I had the Knife and Fork hamburger and we shared a Sweet potato pancake - it was all good and more than filling, loved the pancake and the perfectly crispy and tender rosemary potato side. I had a house blend Bloody Mary to start off at the bar, but it just wasn't to my taste, though maybe fine for others."}
{"text":"Great healthy food options!  Also easy for takeout.  Love the acai bowl.  Hard to find these in Cleveland and their's is one of the best."}
{"text":"Rip off of Market Garden on the same street. It's like they were hoping to catch the overflow from that place. Every thing about this place seems like it's trying too hard (especially the guests). Seems to be a magnet for guys who wear sleevleless shirts with giant arm holes. 

Skimpy on food where it counts. My boyfriend ordered a salad with avocado and they gave such a piddly amount he actually thought they forgot it all together and asked for more. I got a flatbread which was generously sized but nothing special. I will say our waitress was knowledgeable. 

W25th street didnt need another place like this.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Great dinning choice for sure. A very natural and clean feel from everything. The chips all alone were great then add the guacamole and they're spectacular together. The portions are perfect. Upon leaving felt highly satisfied but not sickly full."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. I can't really tell who it's aimed at, and a good age range shows up. The clientele seems to be almost exclusively yuppie ish white people, but yuppie white people with kids, their college pals, older and out for brunch etc. Non white people seem to be Case Western grad students.

I'm drinking a pour over coffee, which itself says something- this place has brunch, lunch, dinner beer, cocktails, crepes, and coffee. It's split down the middle into a restaurant side and a cafe side. The restaurant side has been extremely busy every time I've been here. The restaurant's layout is weird. It seems set up for maximum capacity and minimum mobility- it's hard to get around when anywhere you turn you're brushing against someone's boob.
The cafe is less busy.

The decor, I am a little embarrassed to admit is really attractive. Lots of neat lamps casting warmer than usual light, wood ceilings, wood furniture, all with a modern vibe, and a utilitarian cement floor.

The beer selection is surprisingly good. The food is decidedly average. The coffee is disappointingly average despite its provenance from the mighty Rising Star Coffee roasters.

Overall, it's a fun place to check out, a look into who Ohio city seems to be attracting these days. A place to contemplate Cleveland. Is this who we want to be?"}
{"text":"Town Hall has it all!!! This is one of my favorite spots. Lots of vegan options, organic smoothies and juices, Nitrobru cold brewed coffee,  etc. My faves so far are the veggie burger and Chili Nachos made vegan."}
{"text":"I love the passion of this place, it's got lots of heart, and the healthy eating mantra it touts is much needed in this city. However the crowds here can get a bit much. I have had a few meal mishaps like raw chicken, late food delivery etc. but they always work to make it right. I highly recommend checking this place out because it is THE place to be in the CLE!"}
{"text":"The food really suprised me. I'm not a vegan or an organic eating person. That beening said the Grass feed burger was delicious. The fries were a little over cooked little hard for my liking."}
{"text":"Went for a few beers on Friday night and had a great experience. We were told the wait was 35-45 minutes but the café side was open to seat ourselves. We found an empty table and sat and were taken care of very quickly. Our waitresses name was Christa and she was super friendly and helpful, even helped me find a new favorite beer by asking about what I like and don't like. She made sure to check on us often though she seemed to be the only one serving the café side. Great service, made for a great Friday night. Will be returning for another great time."}
{"text":"Townhall's menu is one of my favorites.  It is one of the most accommodating menus for all types of people. They accommodate Vegans, Paleo lifestyles, with Gluten-Free options, all while striving to be 100% non-GMO.  Cleveland has needed a restaurant like this for quite sometime.  The Kobe Burger is one of my favorites, and I really look forward to trying the Kobe Beef Bolognese. 

They have an amazing beer selection as well!  36 craft beers on draft to be exact! I went to grab some food here on a Monday night and was told it was their $3 Craft Beer Night\", which means they offer all 36 drafts for $3 every Monday night.

I came here for my birthday a week before Thanksgiving and had a great time! We had great service, made new friends, and they surprised me with a skillet cookie!  It was delicious!  

I love the decor and what they have done for the Holidays. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Townhall... overall I was quite pleased with the food and service.  Even only 15 minutes after opening on a Sunday morning the place was filling up quite quickly... my biggest tip for anyone is to be prepared for this place to be bumpin' pretty much across all hours of the day (definitely not a bad thing for the business but you should go in with that mindset as to avoid frustration if you end up going at a peak time).  

I had the full monty and my wife had paleo pancakes.  I'd never had quite as colorful and uniquely flavored hash before and the whole plate complemented itself quite well.  I had a taste of the pancakes and to my surprise they were fairly fluffy (anyone that's ever done a keto diet before would know how tricky it is to get coconut flour or an equivalent to fluff up like these did... good job!)."}
{"text":"The food is so damn good... the quality shines. Have not had one bad item off the menu. The food is what keeps me coming back, it's a shame the service is so poor because I would make this one of my regular dining spots. Unfortunately, I have to prepare myself for slow service and time doesn't always allow that. The poor service is just as consistent as the incredible food."}
{"text":"Stopped in there today for lunch with a friend from NYC ... we shared avocado with salmon tartare and two salads, she the zucchini w shrimp and I the harvest greens with steak ... the avocado and salmon was perfect, the salmon very fresh, absolutely no hint of fishiness ... both of us loved our salads and i loved my grass fed steak which complimented the greens perfectly ... the attention to detail was superb ... the service was great, just great i love this place and i love the facts that they source locally to a large extent ..."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast, which turned out to be their first day open for breakfast.  I ordered the OC Benedict.  

The English muffin was harder than a hockey puck.  The sausage that I paid extra for was ice cold.  The eggs were poached nicely.  I went to put a little salt on it and some idiot had thought it was funny to grind a bunch of salt and put the cap on it, so when I stupidly didn't look first, I dumped a ton of salt on this already hideous mess.  I scraped off as much as I could but the whole thing was just inedible and really an Egg McMuffin would have been much better.  I told the waitress and she took it away.

About a minute later, the chef/part owner appears at our table and apologizes.  He says they will cook another.  I really wasn't very hopeful that this would be any better.  

Boy, was I wrong!  The second attempt was delicious!!  I've been craving another since dinner time the same night.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Townhall. 

I love the concept: A creative menu with tons of vegan/healthy/local options.  In the heart of Ohio City on W25th. Cool space with local prideful décor. Great beer list.

I must admit our last trip was a couple months ago.  Well it wasn't much of a trip because we left.  We went for some drinks and snacks with an out of town friend.  We were sat at a high top smack in the middle of the place. After 15 minutes no acknowledgement from servers. (Actually, a couple of dirty looks.)  So we waited a few more and then I tried the bar.  No success. My girlfriend put on her coat and started to leave.  A waitress ran over and apologized, and actually offered to buy a round but we were done.   I think it is the first time we have walked out of a place.  It may sound unfair but I think it was a continuation of our previous visit:

Friday dinner for 4.  Wait was to be expected.  Hostesses gossiped as we waited in the front.  So we waited 30 minutes- I got a beer at the bar. Hostesses talked about how they had to save tables.. Just a very cliquey feel.  Whatever... So we were eventually sat at the worst table in the house where they stack silverware.  I asked if we were able to move over to an empty table in the middle to which the hostess replied \"those are reserved\".  Just a lousy way to start off the night.  That table remained empty for the 90 minutes we were there. In all honesty the lamb burger I had was awesome.  The rest of the food was so-so to pretty good. The experience still left a bad taste in my mouth.

West 25th is really turning into the Cleveland party scene.  I think this place will succeed because of that.  In my opinion there are too many places in Cleveland that are doing it right to spend my money at Townhall."}
{"text":"No trip to Ohio City is complete without visiting Townhall.  Great for lunch, dinner, drinks, and the Sunday Brunch is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great for a vegan and craft beer lover like myself.  Love it!"}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see a business so fiercely aligned with its mission that can execute such a variety of delictible food.  Townhall is a totally authentic and inspiring restaurant that is 120% packed for bunch and rightly so.  Amongst many items sampled, the huevos rancheros; served in a cask iron skillet with green chilis, black bean encased quesadillas, spicy salsa, decadent fingerling potatoes and two perfect soft boiled eggs, was absolutely wonderful.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"If someone from out of town asked me where they should eat, this would be the place I would tell them. Townhall is very unique with their menu. They have a variety of brunch and lunch and dinner items. Not to mention a very good list of draft beers. The food presentation is excellent. But it only gets better when you taste your order. Great music, tvs, patio and fun bar. Would recommend."}
{"text":"An update...

I came in this morning for my usual avocado toast and bulletproof coffee...which was amazing as always. It set my soul on fire, but I digress.

The service was on point. Kudos to management for taking feedback seriously!"}
{"text":"Worst meal of my life. Bland, bland, bland. The food appeared and tasted like something once frozen. Atmosphere and decor was trendy but the food... Was just awful."}
{"text":"Horrible Service! Celebrating my son's college graduation, we are a vegan family wanting to have a good time. We came with 18 people purchasing drinks and appetizers while we waited patiently for our seats. After 1 hour and 20 mins and never seeing an area being prepared or hostess not being able to give us any answers on the hold-up, we asked to see management. It became very obvious that this was more than us being a large group but being racially profiled and not welcomed. We felt disrespected by management and by staff, we were told to never come back and we will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have actually eaten here. I've been here plenty of times to drink, so I was eager to try the food. We didn't have to wait long for our table, and while we waited, we were able to get beers at the bar. Our waitress was extremely attentive, and we had a bigger party, so since it was so loud, she had to go to back and forth between both ends of the table to explain the menu and take our orders. I got the lamb burger, and it was so good. Done perfectly, with a side of seasoned fries. I would definitely go back there, especially since it looked like they have a killer brunch menu."}
{"text":"Very good food in a hectic atmosphere. The food never disappoints as we've been there about five or six times. I would add the only negative in my eyes is how constantly hectic it is in there. It's a good sign that the place is always bustling, and the service is rarely slowed by it, but it's more of a personal thing (Not liking huge crowds)."}
{"text":"Seriously Corey:  When you don't meet 'expectations', you're RARELY given a 2nd change.  I gave your establishment a 2nd chance and it FAILED again.  Wine in rocks glasses?  Light Pours?  Lousy Bartender?   TRAIN YOUR STAFF BETTER.  It's really not that difficult!

Your staff should not be dropping f-bombs.  They should not be flashing their tits.  They should not be grabbing females' asses, whether they know them or not.  This is all unacceptable.  You're asking for a 3rd chance?  N O T   G O I N G   T O   H A P P E N !

Too many other places to spend our cash at."}
{"text":"Imagine if Whole Foods owned & operated a restaurant, this best sums up Townhall.  I can't say enough good things about the place.  It's by far my personal favorite restaurant in the city of Cleveland.  My last 5 trips to Cleveland, I've eaten at Townhall twice a day. If you're into \"healthy\" eating or just want to try some of the \"healthy\" items without having to prepare them yourself, give this place a try. I've been to many \"trendy\" spots that half heartedly believe in providing the best quality items possible, this isn't the case here. Townhall from A-Z is committed to providing the best quality food possible, and they do it in a very casual way.  If you're a meat eater, great, you'll get the best meat available.  If you're a vegan, great, you'll get the best food available.  But there's no side-eye from one sect to another.  It's a great experience.  Can not wait to go back. May just take a trip back just to eat there for a few days."}
{"text":"Place gets packed for lunch expect it to be very busy. Good beer selection and variety of house made sodas and juices. Usually full of hot chicks and burritos."}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased on my review because I know a few people who work at Townhall however I have been here enough times and have tried a ton of different menu items that my 5 star review has been justified. 

A few of my absolute favorite menu items are the Eggwich (during brunch hours), tthe Bibb Lettuce Wraps, the Chickien Chili Nachos and the best of all the Grilled Cheese Bars + Soup ( I add Prosciutto to mine). A Must try for the ice cream lover is the Willobean Milkshake (to die for)!

All draft beers after 6pm on Mondays are only $3!! During the summer the patio is amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent diverse and original menu in a great part of town recommended by a local resident. Love the mixed drink, beer and pressed juice (non alcoholic) options. Nice outdoor seating area. The sweet potato skins and truffle fries were awesome. Also recommend the hot and cold bowls. We ate here twice during our 5-day stay in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Lloovvee it! The food is always good and the staff are all so nice, why wouldn't you like to eat here??"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because it definitely grabs your attention from the street.  Here's the short breakdown...5 for location, 5 for decor/atmosphere, 5 for drink options, 3 for service ( this place is so big , you shouldnt expect a lot of attention), and sadly a 2 for the food.  I got the flatbread and the wife had the burrito.  Both were unimaginative and fairly bland.  I think if they could get the food thing figured out this could be a go to place"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how I feel about Townhall. It's definitely not my favorite place, but it's also not the worst...sometimes. 

When this establishment opened up on 25th, my husband and I were skeptical. We miss the calmer, cooler 25th with Garage Bar and ABC ruling the street. Townhall was definitely going a different speed and most certainly attracting a different clientele. The first time I came here, a friend and I just wanted a couple of drinks and some snacks. We ended up being ushered to a table, which some \"bros\" had taken over without the hostess's knowledge and then we were stuck. She then squeezed us in on the patio, which was nice, but the service outside was seriously lacking. The next few times I came here, I managed to get bar seats or a nice table among a calm crowd. The service seemed markedly better and the system was definitely ironed out. 

As for the beer selection, I've never been disappointed--it's great having such a wide variety! The food here is actually incredible and I love the noodle bowls and the tomato soup with grilled cheese is so yummy. The biggest problem I've had here is, as expected, the crowd. I've seen people groping each other, basically on top of the bar, on a Sunday here. I've seen bros grab-assing blacked-out girls. I've been basically elbowed in the face by boozy meatheads. It's not fun. The best time here is when everyone else is at work--I had a great time with a friend here when we took a day off of work and were 2 of maybe 6 people in the entire bar. 

The bar itself, when chilled out, is fun and I'll probably keep coming back for the food, but it's certainly not my cup of tea on the weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing! Enough said! Grassfed beef bolognese with roasted spaghetti squash. Clean eating at its best. My new fave!"}
{"text":"Just showed up for our reservation for 14 for a 50th birthday and guess what..no spots for us!  Went down the street to the Market Garden and they took care of us!  Go to Market Garden instead!!

As follow up to this, I received an immediate response from the Town Hall team with a sincere apology and a plan to make it right. What more can you ask for.  Great job at follow through and customer service.  We look forward to coming back and trying this place as it was highly recommended by a friend. I am sure they won't disappoint. 

Apparently customer service still matters to some!  Thank you Town Hall for making it right!  Great night, great food, great service!  Thanks Mandy!  Look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Just OK, perfect way to describe this place. This place is almost always packed, I'm still not sure why. In my opinion, it can't be the food which is just middle of the line. Their price range is fine, and their burritos and taco's aren't bad either. My issue stems back from when I ordered the steak. It was cooked well done and I ordered it medium and the sides didn't impress me at all. My dog ate the steak for dinner that night. The herb chicken is pretty good, no denying that. But too much of a good things can turn bad, just a little much, even if you do like herbs. It was tender and flavorful though. I did tell myself if I go back I would try the scallops. They look good and come recommended from the wait staff. If I ever do make it back again for a third time (doubtful) I will get them a try."}
{"text":"Excellent options for brunch! I had the wakey wakey and vigor smoothie. 

The bacon is amazing! So thick and flavorful, definitely an interesting departure from the crispy bacon you get at the supermarket. The biscuit in the wakey wakey was on the dryer side but still delicious. More of a crumbly biscuit than flakey. It tasted a like it had some cornmeal mixed in but I'm not quite sure if that's really what they did. 

The smoothie was refreshing but I feel like for the price, it's more of a treat-yo-self item. But hey, treat-yo-self well and often. 

Above anything, I thought that the level of service made the meal. The staff is attentive and thoughtful. I will be returning shortly to try their truffle fries!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's a couple of blocks from my house. The atmosphere is probably the best I've ever seen. Very trendy. Love the concrete floors and interior metal gates to separate different areas."}
{"text":"Reading reviews it definitely seems like people are very fast to judge a new restaurant in the hottest area in Cleveland right now.  I agree with some others to give the place a chance to get things figured out.  They obviously didn't expect the amount of business they are receiving.  Anyways onto my first experience..

A group of 4 of us came to eat around 7:30 on a Saturday.  We were told about a 30 minute wait, but there is 'bar seats' that are first come first serve, so we sat at an open booth in the back.  Hostess made sure we had a server and service was pretty good.  The food is so great because there's no place like it in CLE.  Healthy options that taste great and are reasonable.  I love it and love the fast casual option too.  Beers are all $5 no matter what, but depending on alcohol content is what kind of glass they put it in.  They have great options, including many I've never had.

I love the decor and open garage concept in the front and back of the place.  The back patio is huge.

Obviously this place is going to be very popular at first, and hoping they figure out some of the kinks.  I'll definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"If you're getting uber eats delivery in the Ohio City/Tremont area there are some good food options from Townhall, but they've made some mistakes on our orders before (forgot an item one time, and isn't read the special instructions to not add avocado due to an allergy). We've gone in person a few times but didn't like the atmosphere, there are better places to eat at on W 25th."}
{"text":"Food truck tacos, tomato bisque, veggie flatbread, rice bowls, truffle Parmesan matchstick fries... Every last meal was delicious. Even the espresso brought a smile to my face. Service was super awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to giving this place another try...this time for a Sunday brunch and we had a much better experience.  Our server was a great guy and took excellent care of our large table.  he offered some solid recommendations and was attentive with the coffee refills.

To start. we ordered a stack of (three) pancakes for the table to share.  These cakes are definitely on the sweet side, made from sweet potato flour and served with maple butter, syrup and mixed berries.  They were dense, but not heavy making for a great pancake.  I would be hard-pressed to eat an entire plate by myself, but for sharing purposes they were just right.

The family we ate with wanted to sample multiple dishes, so my friend and I want halvsies on two choices...the eggs benedict and the southern comfort.  For my taste, the southern comfort (TownHall's version of biscuits and gravy) was too far onto the sweet side (I prefer a more savory version) and I think it was because the biscuit was sweet.  but the presentation and flavors were good.  The eggs benedict was cooked just right...runny egg, good hollandaise sauce and a nice sausage patty.  The home fries (just into small wedges) were fried and seasoned to perfection.

The daytime atmosphere at TownHall was electric...lots of energy as folks from all walks of life were sharing a morning together and enjoying good food.  Glad we gave this place a second go."}
{"text":"After waiting 2 hours for a burger and Fries, I Can't believe people in Cleveland think this place is worth it? Please explain to me what attracts folks to this place? They don't take reservations of parties of 8 BUT they do for 12 or more, so when we arrived at 7:30 the hostess said an hour which was okay so but now at 9:30 the hostess said we don't know when we will seat you.... Seriously what is the draw... I can't believe this in a city with such good foodie places. I will never return here. And it's sad because this place will survive.... The manager eventually made us a table but informed us we don't have a server as were in the cafe side of the restaurant. We fought for a waitress to take our table order, but she did so in increments of 2, yes that's right. She would take 2 peoples order then leave. We had to track her down 7 minutes later to give her the rest of the table but again she took 2 and left. Food started to arrive before the entire table of 8 had their orders taken. This place cracks me up; it's packed and I don't know why? Then I have to go  to the bar for drinks because the server disappears, but the bartender doesn't even pour a 4 count or close."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around 10 PM.

Is it a bar? A lounge? A club? A late night gourmet eatery? Patio? Kind of all of the above. You'll see folks dressed for a casual backyard hangout and folks dressed for clubbing and everything in-between.  If you have a mixed group looking for different social options it could be the perfect compromise. A decent amount of seating space even late at night if you need seats although the back patio was pretty packed (it was a nice night).

They have a great domestic tap beer selection (30+) that rotates regularly.  

Food:
Truffle oil was overpowering in the fries that were fairly unremarkable.

Grass-fed Kobe burger was very delicious and beefy with fresh vegetables and delicious sauce.  I kind of doubt it was real Kobe (Wagyu? Is real Kobe even grass-fed?), but it was very delicious nonetheless. Meaty, substantial, tender, flavorful. Brioche bun was able to stand up to the patty yet still light and fluffy.

Nachos and chips+ avocado (with goat cheese) were both excellent as well."}
{"text":"If you're simply looking for atmosphere I guess this is your place, but it's really overpriced and the food is less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food, plenty of vegan options and draft beer. A must if you come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Service was average and I wasn't happy brunch is only on the weekends. But the food totally made up for it. I got the truffle fries, and curry chicken. It was amazing. The lime really made it. I would in a heart beat go back and order something different."}
{"text":"Townhall is the best \"casual dining\" restaurant in Cleveland.  I have tried every menu item and while I Iove some things more than others, I honestly like every single food item they offer. If i had to pick one thing for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner it would be an açaí bowl, biscuits and gravy, grilled cheese and vegan chili, and the wild salmon dish respectively.  Make sure to order the skillet cookie as dessert! It is unique that everything is non GMO and organic. I never feel horrible after I finish eating a meal there like I will at other restaurants. The restaurant decor and overall mood compliments their menu giving off an \"organic and earthy\" vibe.  The beer and cocktail list is extensive offering many styles of beer and I love the fact that the cocktails change with the seasons. My current favorite is the chocolate wasted cocktail. Townhall also has weekly events which are awesome ranging from talks about health and food, to pop ups shops from different local businesses."}
{"text":"I'm not huge into the whole organic, non-GMO thing, so that aspect of TH's marketing doesn't appeal to me as it might to others. I've had this sort of thing before, and by the same standard TH was slightly cheaper without losing much by way of quality.

The restaurant was large, well-kept, with plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. It seems like the owners have taken great care to devise an intentional aesthetic, and it shows.

Our food was good, served quick, and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Portioning was a tad small for my tastes, but that tends to be par for the course when you're buying non-GMO, organic, locally-sourced fare.

They had food for our friends' doggo, which he enjoyed.

Despite warnings that the Bangkok Bazaar was spicy, I found it medium spiciness at best.

Would go again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch in the area! My friends and I split 3 appetizers and had some drinks. The location is perfect, the atmosphere is rustic and unique, and the staff is friendly. Great place to take even kids during the day. At night it gets busy because of the nightlife, but it's never unbearable. Delicious and healthy food for a decent price. They can make lots of things gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan!

Definitley give it a visit."}
{"text":"Awesome establishment. It's a great place for brunch and great for nightlife. The food is amazing and the drinks are intriguingly good. The menu has a great variety. The staff is knowledgable and friendly.  Multiple thumbs up and 10 starts if I could."}
{"text":"We decided to try Townhall today as it has been on our list of fun places to explore. Loved it so much and cannot wait to go back. I order the salmon poke bowl and my husband had the bim bim boo. Miss ordered Thai bowl, chicken sandwich, and flatbread. Apps were Harissa cauliflower and they were to die for ! Also had the chicken chili nachos. Now that you know all this, let me tell you it was fab! We went around 1:30 and it was very packed. Seated immediately however. Service was excellent as was the whole ethos of the place . The fact that this place is here makes my heart sing - non GMO, organic, grass fed, and my favorite bulletproof coffee as well . Sublime. Overall, highly recommend if you want to eat healthy and in a great atmosphere . My kids loved it as well and they are some pretty tough critics ."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Townhall after wanting to for a while. When we got there it was very busy. We got our place in line and they told us it would be 20-30 minutes. After 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would be. They told us there were still three groups ahead of us. Then they told us about the cafe side where you order your own food and seat yourself. I understood people where enjoying there time, so it was a longer wait, but I wish they would have told us right away about the cafe side. We didn't know that was an option and we would have went right away.

I did love the fact that you give your cell phone number and they would text you when your table is ready.

Once we ordered our food it came out very quickly. I got the leg day smoothie, which was absolutely amazing. It was very tasty and had a great texture. Then I also ordered the zucchini pasta. It was delicious with all the different vegetables. I would love to go back again when it isn't a busy time and I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"This place has very modern decor and an all around good vibe. The food is fantastic. The 100% grass-fed burger was what I got, and it was very impressive and moderately priced at $12. Beer selection is also impressive, there are probably around 45 beers on it and a quick description of each one. Also, if you go here before a Cavs game, there is a free shuttle to the Q and they give you a token that's good for a $1 draft at TownHall after the game. Makes it a great spot for before and after the game."}
{"text":"I really love Townhall so much. If I lived closer I would probably spend all of my money here. It's the only restaurant I've found in Cleveland where I can confidently order gluten-free, dairy-free food, and know that it will actually be gluten-free, dairy-free AND delicious. I'm a huge foodie, and my dietary constraints definitely make it hard to get good food, but thankfully Townhall exists! I always want to go back after I've been here to try something new. 

Townhall saved me last night after a concert at Jacobs Pavilion. It was so great to be able to go to a healthy restaurant at midnight and order good food. I got a gluten-free Classico flatbread with no cheese and added sausage, and it was exactly what I needed after a concert and not eating dinner. My brother got the paleo baked buffalo chicken tenders, which were by far the best chicken tenders I've ever had! Yum! 

The only reason I can't give five stars is because of the smoking that is allowed on the beautiful patio. We were so excited to sit in the cute bench/booth area, but were not happy with the cigarette smoke that blew over constantly while we ate. We already got our share of way too much cigarette smoke at the concert, so were disappointed that smoking was allowed at this amazing, healthy restaurant. Smoking just doesn't seem to fit the vibe here. 

I'd love it if there were a sister restaurant to Townhall that wasn't so crazy and loud- so maybe without a bar? I know that is a stretch, but I'd love to have a place to go exactly like Townhall without the craziness and loudness that comes with it. And of course no cigarettes allowed. 

I still love Townhall and will come again, but will definitely try my best to avoid late nights and other exceptionally busy times."}
{"text":"I'm not gunna lie, I kind of love this place. It is easily my now-favorite-spot in Cleveland. I've been here for dinner and drinks, for a \"night out\" on the patio, and for their DELICIOUS weekend brunch. And I have had a fabulous experience every time, for all occasions. I love their food - it's always good to me. I love their whole \"non-gmo, local, organic, etc. etc.\" thing too. It's like a little bonus to the fact that it's all already tasty and fresh. I've, personally, never had a problem with the service and every waitress/waiter I've had has been super friendly and helpful*. Parking can be a pain for their brunch on the weekend, but mostly because the west side market is also happening on sat. 

Speaking of brunch: GET THE EGGWICH. Or build your own crepe. All of their brunch beverages are surprisingly light and fresh, and there's some bomb-ass coffee (the kickstarter) with melted butter in it (??). Don't ask, just drink. 

*Sans for once our table waitress didn't know what a saison was... I asked if they had any on their massive tap list, and she said no quite curtly and walked away. Cut to me ordering my drink 10 minutes later.... one of the 2 saisons on the list..."}
{"text":"Really excellent drink selection and good vegetarian options. A crowd-pleaser unless you have some exceptionally picky eaters in the group. A few dollars past what I would usually expect to pay for what they make, but very good quality. Good veggie burger!"}
{"text":"Best food and drink in Ohio city! Ask for Nikki! Best service as well! Had a blast and was on sportscenter!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Excellent selections of beers- ask for samples- they are so helpful!  The menu is all gluten-free, paleo or vegan and soooo good!  Don't let that scare you- the food is so good you won't even know you are eating healthy!  The potato skin appetizer was excellent- three half potatoes.  The beef bolognese was kind of spicy, and the tuna poke was fresh and flavorful.  It gets busy- make a reservation, but don't book through Open Table like I did- I accidentally booked a table at the Town Hall in San Francisco!!! The hostesses were quite gracious and recommended we wait in the cafe- we did- great drinks and board games to help you pass the time.  Speaking of drinks, order a soda and then ask to fill it yourself- there is a whole wall of organic sodas to choose from!"}
{"text":"Gotta say it...the Harvest salad with grilled chicken is the best salad I have had in a while. Great mixture of flavors...mixed greens, goat cheese, cranberries walnuts, apples and other things tossed with some kind of fruity vinagrette.  The salad was the *perfect* temperature and the chicken was warm.  Bravo Townhall.  I have always loved you and now you give me another reason to love you.  And you also have Whitehaven Sauv Blanc by the glass which helps.  And Paleo options.  I could go on forever..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to come here. I loved it all. We only had a 20 minute wait for Sunday brunch which isn't bad at all. Every staff member I encountered was super nice (Julie was our waitress and very sweet) I loved the atmosphere and it's way bigger than I expected. I got the ABC juice, origin pour over coffee (love my coffee black and this was good stuff) and sweet potato hotcakes. All of it was perfect! I couldn't even finish the hotcakes and the juice hit the spot. My mom got the Southern Comfort dish which was delicious and had so much flavor. She also had the Jalapinata juice which, yes, has jalapeños in it...you can taste them but you don't get the hot kickback. It was different but good and clearly well made. I would love to go back and have some beer (great beer list) and dinner on the patio (which looked very nice). I'd recommend this place for anyone of any age. Last but not least, they are ORGANIC and NON-GMO! You can't beat it. Get there ASAP!"}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent Townhall an each time the food is top notch.  Some of my favorite items include the Herbed Chevre Board the Thai Peanut Bowl, and the BBQ chicken flatbread. 

Any of their menu items pair well with their wide variety of $5 Drafts, and for those beer lovers looking for a deal Monday nights after 6 p.m. all drafts are only $3!!

Nine out of ten times service is fantastic, however on a busy night or during a special event it can slow down."}
{"text":"Had me some super delicious spaghetti squash bolognese. i was kind of blown away.   Inspired me to reverse engineer the dish at home but i couldn't even come close.   Loved that they have kids size milkshakes for my rugrats.  Fresh menu overall."}
{"text":"One of my favorite CLE brunch spots for sure. Love the mimosas! It's refreshing to eat at a place that makes it obvious that they give a shit about where the food comes from and that its moderately healthy.
As a warning, it gets PACKED and the service is not always awesome. However, insider tip, the cafe next door has the exact same menu and there is always space. As long as you don't mind ordering at the counter that's often the way to go."}
{"text":"Fun patio, healthy food options with organic and paleo ingredients."}
{"text":"Nice set up with a large outdoor area and patio, was with a group of ten so I kind of understood it would take a while for the food, but i thought it may have been a touch excessive. The tomatoe soup was good, all though had a lot of ginger in it. I ordered the thai bowl, and the white rice was very dry without the peanut sauce. The server was very funny and friendly, overall seems like a spot that wants to mimick williamsburg in NYC, but hey there trying there best in good old cleveland."}
{"text":"My lady friend and I went to Touch Supper Club for a show hoping that they were serving food. However, the extremely apathetic bartender at Touch informed us that they only serve brunch on Sunday, no dinner. Not to be denied, we left the show to find somewhere on West 25th we could get some eats.

We walked down Market Avenue, past the Market Avenue Wine Bar (I made their web site like 13 years ago), past the Flying Fig, and across 25th to Town Hall. We entered the cafeteria style side and I inquired about getting food. The helpful girl behind the counter told me that we could order food on this side or receive service on the other side, so to the other side we went.

Now, I don't go out very often, as in, out to clubs. I go out to dinner, but not out to drink and socialize. I have friends who are promoters and I sometimes go to their shows to support them, but I am more of a quiet dinner type. This place is the opposite of that. It seems like a bit of a pick-up spot, where 20-somethings go to be seen and hook up. There were many people here. There's nothing wrong with that, and I saw plenty of beautiful girls so I have nothing to complain about.

The service we received here was exemplary. We were seated, received menus and ordered our food in no time. The ambitious menu included lots of information about what was Vegetarian, Gluten Free and what was available as Gluten Free if desired. I had the Hamburger and my date had the Chicken and Black Bean Nachos. Both were excellent. The Hamburger came with fries that were seasoned and tasted great. I was a little worried that the food wouldn't be good because of the chaotic surroundings, but the chef clearly cared about my meal, and I appreciated it. Also, when the check came our sodas were not on it! Awesome! Two great meals at a trendy, popular spot with good service for less than $25! I will come back."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for vegan night. I was in Cleveland for just a few days and made it over here. The food was pretty mediocre, but I appreciated the $3 drafts. Here's what kinda bugged me about this place: I asked two employees questions about the menu, and neither of them had tried the food! \"Oh I haven't tried anything off the vegan menu,\" etc. I think at a restaurant, most servers should taste everything so they can answer questions and be helpful. I also thought the ladies manning the register were kinda short with customers - clearly in a big hurry and not friendly. (We did the cafe side - opted out of table service, as there was a 45-minute wait on a Monday. Good for them!) I'd pick a different vegan option if in the area again."}
{"text":"I keep on wanting to fall in love with this place because I like it's variety and veggie/vegan options and healthy eating approach in a pretty cool venue. But as a carnivore, the food just isn't that great. My first meal was eggs benedict and they poached the eggs in way too much vinegar...rookie mistake on such a classic dish. The burger there is regular and not memorable... Really. The shining things on the menu are the skillet cookie with Mitchell's ice cream and the sweet potato pancakes.  Mmmm sweet potato pancakes!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a bruncher but dayuuuum was this place good!  First of all, it's massive.  There are two outdoor areas, half of the place is sit-down with wait staff, the other half is more like a cafe where you order at the counter and seat yourself (but the menu is the same!), they have a made-to-order crepe station right in the middle, baked goods, a large menu...LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The food is absolutely delicious and you can tell the ingredients are quality.

I may have feasted a little.  I ordered the burrito with truffle fries.  Oh my yum.  I paired it off with açai juice drink with was so refreshing and so fresh!  I also got to try the eggwich, equally excellent, and I may or may not have gotten a chocolate chip cookie which was pure butter.  Honestly, I think you can order anything here and it'll be great AND because it's one of those non-GMO, organic, hipstery places, you feel like you're being healthy.  Now pass me another cookie, please."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots anywhere in the country! The food & service is great. Full non gmo menu w/ a juice & coffee bar. Best craft beer selection I've seen too. Must try the brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"We're having a great time at Town Hall, outstanding beer list, excellent service, valet parking for $7...We're part of a large group but we got a table fairly quickly (despite the place being packed) and got great service from Janelle. Efficient, food came quickly, drinks also pretty fast. I tried a cider and several IPAs, the beer list is extensive and reasonably priced. The food was also good; we had the stuffed dates, sweet potato skins and a poke bowl which was better than expected...and we lived in Hawaii for six years! All in all a great Saturday night out with friends.

My only quibble would be that at a little after 7pm it was very, very dark inside. Couldn't read the menus without cell phones dark. Other than that, we had a great time."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is awesome. The service was fantastic, the food was wonderful, and the atmosphere is super fun. We will definitely be going back. The place is huge with a really nice outdoor patio.
It is also dog friendly! They even have a little dog menu. 
Try the bacon, you won't be disappointed. Also the biscuits are wonderful."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant with a chill atmosphere, great service, versatile selection of food and drinks, and a perfect location with convenient free parking in the back lot. I ate here with a few friends for a Sunday brunch. We arrived early around 10am and there was zero wait - I definitely suggest going early if you want to beat the crowd. 

There were so many choices to choose from on the menu, and we ended up getting three dishes: the Eggwich, the Full Monty, and the Spicy chicken curry noodle - all of which I highly recommend! Also I love being able to get a free drip coffee through the Yelp app. Our waitress even gave me an extra coffee cup to-go when we were heading out - very much appreciated! Portion sizes for the dishes were just right and the price range was definitely a fantastic deal when compared to what I've seen at other brunch venues around the Ohio City area. Our order ranged from about $9-11 per dish. Also I highly recommend ordering something with bacon, because they give a generous thick slab of bacon. 

Overall I think Townhall is an excellent choice for meeting up with family or friends for brunch. I definitely look forward to returning here for another meal and perhaps trying out their dinner menu sometime!"}
{"text":"Eating the best cold zucchini noodle salad!  So fresh, service is excellent, matcha blast drink was awesome. Feeling healthy and happy as I do some computer work in the cafe.  Always quality food and I love that it is GMO free."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood meeting spot with great fresh food options and a dual personality.  One side is a bar with a great group feel and outdoor patio and the other side is more of a fast casual quieter more laid back.  Friendly staff and good food and atmosphere make this a favorite to meet up."}
{"text":"Was visiting a girlfriend in Cleveland and was lucky enough to go to Townhall for brunch!  It was around 10am and super busy, but I can definitely see why.  We choice to sit outside on the patio instead of waiting for a table inside and it was perfect.  Very trendy decor and menu options.

I got bullet proof coffee and opted for the a la carte menu for  eggs, bacon and homefries.  The bacon was everything bacon should be.  One of my friends got the avocado toast and it looked super fresh and also fresh squeezed orange juice (it seriously was squeezed moments before it was brought to the table).

The ONLY minor complaint I would have was that it was a little slow service wise, but it was 10am on a Sunday, so I'm definitely not dwelling on that.  I can't wait to visit Tremont again and go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and truffle fries. Good decor. Nice seating outside and inside. Asked the waiter for a sweet drink and she made an amazing limeade, deep eddy peach, and activated charcoal drink. Would return again!"}
{"text":"Townhall is a staple for my friends and I to eat before going out, grab a quick drink, watch the game, or get brunch! They have unique healthy items on their menu that cater to many different dietary restrictions. 

and customer service is always above and beyond as well. Will continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Really like this place - in the summer both the front and back are open to let lots of breezy sunshine in. Had dinner on a Monday night (their Vegan night) but ordered off the regular menu. The veggie burger was a step up from most places, but to the level I would expect from a restaurant that uses local ingredients. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, loved the ambiance. Had an amazing waitress who treated us extremely kindly and was awesome. Great quality food too. A little expensive but not bad. Would recommend to a friend to check out."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have never had poor service or poor quality food and they have Prosecco."}
{"text":"Like bros? Want to eat in a place overtaken by college kids scream-talking at each other? Then Townhall is for you. I actually used to love Townhall because they have so many vegetarian and vegan options. The atmosphere wasn't great, but I sucked it up. The last time I went, I was absolutely starving and really looking forward to my veggie burger. What came out was stomach-turning: a super soft patty that seemed like it was made up of 90% beets and nothing else inside. It seemed super undercooked and just disgusting to look at for someone who doesn't even want to be reminded of what medium rare meat looks like (almost the same color). The burger had no flavor. Our waitress was incredibly nice (waitstaff is awesome) and didn't charge us when i sent it back. Still, the experience was enough for me to really lower my trust in the quality of their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Love this place. Obsessed with the truffle fries. Me and my friend visited CLE for the first time and this was our favorite bar. Kevin was the best bartender.. so attentive and friendly!!!! Would absolutely come back"}
{"text":"Had only one drink. Wanted to check out the tuna poke but didn't have a chance. The ambience seems to be awesome. Granted I was here on a caliver playoffs game, so there extra excitement above and beyond the typical."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming in today, and while the food was amazing and our waitress Megan was the best, I couldn't help but notice the owner walking around huffing and puffing. I continued to watch him scold and argue with three other managers, treating them with such disrespect. Finally he noticed our whole table starring, only to move to the next room to continue his scolding. I will not be back. I will not support a company that shows his employees with such lack of respect and unprofessionalism. There could've been a better time, or even a better place if it was something that needed to be addressed at that moment"}
{"text":"TownHall is great for many reasons, they have a great drink menu whether it be beer, cocktails or their fresh squeezed juices. They also have a unique menu and one of the best brunches in town.

Nights and weekends draw a large crowd but it doesn't feel claustrophobic and the staff do their best to keep everyone happy. They also have a large outdoor area and plenty of bar seating.

Don't go here if you're in a rush. However, if you have time it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic craft beer selection.  Excellent Vegan options (esp Monday nights).  #tofubuffalowings #spicynoodles.

The wait for a table was a bit long, but that's a good sign.  Everyone wants to be here!"}
{"text":"Good place for vegetarians or other health conscious folks. Diverse menu with different spins on some standard dishes. They offer lots of information on the menu concerning gluten, GMOs, etc. had the lamb burger w/ fries;  pretty good. 

Very good selection of beers with an informative menu. Large, attractive layout with sports bar level of large tvs. Also has a nice patio."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and eat healthy  drink list is nice as well staff laid back  Ohio city salad is awesome   smoothies look great just not trying them just yet"}
{"text":"Have been to Townhouse on several occasions--brunch, dinner and late night cervesas. Eggs Benny is pretty strong, could be more food for cost. Spicy bloody was great. Kobe beef burger for supper was tender and delicious, priced competitively. The beer list here is diverse and the beer menu is detailed and updated frequently. The atmosphere is fantastic during the day and for dinner. The open front to back styling with patios on either side is great, although on weekends from 11-2 it will take you ten minutes to get from one side to the other. To be fair they should not be criticize for popularity. Will be back."}
{"text":"Everything is just perfect. Food, design, service, quality, and atmosphere.  
Perfect..."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots near the downtown Cle area because of their huge bacon. Seriously, it's like eating a rib and it's most pleasurable (refer to photo). They have a cooler menu than most with vegan options if that's how you roll. Oh, and the atmosphere is usually bumpin. If you're looking for a bar in Ohio City, this is the most popular. Note: they do not have picklebacks."}
{"text":"Great food! Good service! Veggie burger was amazing and the fries were yummy! I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that the couple if times I have been here, the service was awful. Food was mediocre at best. For as many servers are walking around you would think you would be accommodated..nope. The music is bad and too loud. The concept has great potential, but lost in translation."}
{"text":"Amazing service and experience. Food was great, but the best part about it was the service. Ali, Gavin and Brittany at the bar quenched our thirst, fed us and took care of us like we were little baby birds. This place has the best crew in the Land!"}
{"text":"We hit up townhall on a Friday just as they were opening for lunch. They were sort of disorganized when we first arrived, but hey, they'd just opened for the day and I'm always willing to forgive when a restaurant can really deliver on food; and boy oh boy, did they deliver. We started our meal out with an order of sweet potato skins, which were topped with some kind of greens and a sauce. I'd never seen or heard of sweet potato skins, but they were just as amazingly delicious as they sound. Generally, I'm not a fan of any food that's green and healthy, so my first instinct was to scrape them off. If you share my disgust for green and healthy foods, I have a bit of advice for you... STOP! Resist the urge to dispose of the glorified leaves and savor the flavor combination you're about to experience. All the textures and flavors worked together in a really spectacular way, and honestly, it should be a crime to disrupt that. For my entree, I went with the Bangkok bazaar bowl. It had chicken, shrimp, noodle and mixed vegetables in a pad Thai broth. When I first got the bowl, I was Leary of the mixed vegetables, but they were fresh tasting and added a layer of complexity to the dish that you really don't want to miss out on. All in all, I was a little skeptical of townhall at the start, but I'm really glad we went there and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice. Once with my parents - who are very picky  vegetarians, and once on a date night. We've enjoyed the avocado mash as an appetizer, and also liked the grilled  cheese sandwich and chicken noodle soup (somewhat spicy). Service is fast. Ambiance is fun, casual, and hipster. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Townhall because I know I can trust everything on the menu. Going on Monday nights when they have Vegan night is great because they have special vegan options that are typically on the menu. Everything is fresh, full of flavor and zest, and I never feel guilty after a full meal. Props this place and everything they are about!"}
{"text":"This was a much needed place in Cleveland.  Atmosphere is casual but nice.  Great outdoor space.  Food is pretty good and drinks as well. I like the crowd, its a good place to have a dinner, drinks or a group event.  I'm a fan of the appetizers with dates and also the pizza with goat cheese."}
{"text":"Well I originally came here to receive counseling for my sex addiction but it turned out that was a different place. ANYHOW, when I arrived I realized how neat of a place it was so I took my sperry's off, removed my socks (gave to a homeless man), put my sperrys back on, and yelled, TRENDY (At the top of my lungs). Boy, I'd say at least the couple sitting next to me could hear me!

I digress, I thought this place was full of character and soul-searching soul! Is that a thing? It may be 1/15th overrated because its the hot new joint in Cleveland right now, but man this place could get it!

The workers were nice and cool and had very big eyes, so you knew they were happy! Good beer selection, nice open atmosphere, and the babes are babes. YELP!"}
{"text":"So rolled in with the crew the other night on a snowy, cold, and windy Saturday night. Rolled in with an expected 45 minute wait. Turned into a 1 and a half hour wait...which is fine, but you'd usually expect some \"oh sorry for your wait.\" Finally seated. Took some time just to get water. Took even longer to get orders taken. We were looking at 1.5 hours before being seated and 2 hours to get a food order taken. Got the burger and some nachos for appetizer. Burger was good, nothing mind blowing. There were 3 of us who ordered medium rare (I mean, let's be honest...any other doneness would be sacrilege except for maybe rare). We all get medium well to well done. I was hungry beyond belief and said screw it. It wasn't exactly cardboard I think because there was enough fat to keep it relatively juicy. One member in the party sent it back, and to TH's credit, they took it back without question and returned one in a relatively prompt manner. The fries were pretty thin without much crisp. Only reason I didn't give 2 stars were because the nachos were good and the drinks were made well. Would probably come back at night for drinks but probably not for food again."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, obviously a lot of money was spent on the handcrafted wood & industrial steel decor.  Open garage-style doors at each end give a very open feel & today there was a breeze, however on a real scorcher this may be a detriment.  

I've been twice so far, day 1 & day 2.  Last night we sampled from their extensive craft beer list & ordered the Fig & Prosciutto flatbread.  Beer was good & flatbread could have been with a lighter hand on the fig jam.  The overall effect was like eating a fig noutan laced with cinnamon & topped with bacon. Too sweet for me & my companions.  Beers took 20' & waters were not refilled, but apparently there was a blip in their POS system.  More server training is obviously needed. This is to be expected on opening day.

Lunch today was really nice.  They have an interesting concept - full service on 1 side & fast casual on the other.  Unusually, the same menu functions for both.  Menu selection is a little sparse & geared to the health consciouse.  Way too many brown rice & vegetarian options for me, but this may appeal to the crunchier side of Ohio City.

I opted for the turkey club with the simple salad (1 of the side options included in the price) & a Coco Loco Smoothy.  The sandwich was nice - light & fresh tasting, good bread.  The turkey itself was smoked deli turkey & not bad.  I would have preferred fresh roasted turkey, which is what I expected from a place that bills itself as organic when possible & farm to table.  Simple salad was good, but vinaigrette was overwhelmingly tart.  The smoothy was delicious & incredibly kale-filled.  When I 1st saw its incredible greeness I was dubious, but it turned out to be a good choice.

Service today was fantastic on the fast casual side.  I walked right up to the counter & the cashieer was knowledgable, friendly & helpful. I snagged a seat on the front patio (back patio still under construction) & the food was delivered quickly.  Management on duty was friendly & eager to please.

All in all, I think this is a great addition to Ohio City which will give McNulty World a run for it's money.  I'm looking forwared to trying their after 10PM cigar list & extensive bourbon offerings."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Sunday and sat over in the cafe side - order everything at the counter. The crowd was kinda lousy; drunks, cougars, self important types... in other words, people I have no use for. Food was very good. Wife had the diver scallops and I had a \"Kobe\" cheeseburger. Fries were good too. Beer list was good and prices not bad. Will probably return."}
{"text":"My good friend Taras invited me to stop by and try some of their Non-GMO meals. 

I've been there at least 4 or 5 times since then. Definitely a great place to watch some of your favorite sports. If it's too loud in the bar area, you always can go to a cafe area or outside. 

Huge variety of beer. Definitely try their \"cookie\" desert. 

If you are in Cleveland, Townhall is definitely a place to stop by for a lunch or dinner, or spend a great evening with your friends."}
{"text":"A couple of months back a friend and I came there to check things out, space is pretty, service was friendly and we were able to sit down right away but I guess we were there in that  in between time where lunch was over and dinner options weren't being served til after 5PM to which I was really confused.  

Our server was very accommodating and was able to let us know what alternate  options were available and the specialty drinks were pretty tasty while waiting.  After we were served unfortunately the entrees were just meh and considering the price level neither of us weren't really impressed with either.  

It was my first time, my friend enjoyed the previous meal experience though.  I don't think I'll go back to grab a meal but I could try another go with the tasty drinks at the bar perhaps."}
{"text":"Food portions are large . I love the breakfast menu with create your own crepe! The cafe has great drinks as well. The flat breads is also a smart call for a good lunch option. 

The environment is usually upbeat and the decor is modern meets industrial, both of which I love. Has a lot of Cleveland pride

You can expect a short wait on dinner or breakfast hours but lunch almost always got seated right away."}
{"text":"Everything is really good, sometimes the service can be really slow, but only when it is super crowded, even though it's one of my favorite places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Town Hall for a while and finally got around to it! I was not disappointed! I went with two friends for an early lunch on Presidents Day. We started off with some delicious bloody marys and some enjoyable conversation with the bartender. The drink selection definitely seems solid!  I ordered the tacos with tofu to eat and they were so good!  My friends got the thai bowl and burrito - they were equally pleased! Overall, it's a solid menu with lots of vegetarian friendly items and just interesting things in general. Very unique and everything sounds delicious. It's a tad pricey but not unreasonable and you get a good quality meal for the price. The restaruant itself is awesome looking. Very big and I absolutely loved the decor. Just little touches all over the place that came together beautifully!"}
{"text":"My experience with Townhall was great before I even stepped foot in the restaurant. I found them on here after doing a search for gluten-free restaurants in Cleveland. My boyfriend and I were coming into town for the Cavs game from Columbus and I was on a Paleo Whole30 so I needed something healthy. I was so excited when I saw that they had paleo menu items so I emailed the restaurant and their rep, Kayla, responded very quickly. They normally don't take reservations for parties of less than 6 but she set us up since we were driving in from out of town and were on a time crunch. My happy little Paleo heart did jumping jacks when I saw that the menu was clearly labeled with items that were either Paleo or Paleo Available. No more asking \"can this be made gluten-free? I also have a soy and dairy sensitivity - is there any in this dish?\". Frustrating for me and annoying for most servers I'm sure. The menu had so many options, I didn't have to ask my annoying questions, and our waitress, Gabrielle, was super helpful and attentive the whole time. I got a HUGE Superfood salad that was delicious (it was missing the chicken but that's okay! It was still good) and their spicy jalapeno cold-pressed juice. My boyfriend got a cashew-crusted chicken sandwich that he loved. I wish I had time to try the paleo cookie but I didn't. Fun fact: if you go on game nights, they have a free shuttle that takes you to the Q and back! The shuttle driver also gives you a token for a $1 beer for after the game (which being on Whole30 ruined for me!). I begged our server to tell the owner to open a location in Columbus because I would seriously go every week if I didn't die from excitement first."}
{"text":"Great menu with lots of truly healthy options. Bacon wrapped dates were great, as was the asked avocado. Pretty packed on Saturday at 6. We waited about an hour and they don't take reservations on the weekends but that is the price you pay for going to a restaurant that many people love. The waitress was great and it ended up being a great place for our 3 kids. I would definitely go again. All in all I would say that the food was solid but not \"amazing\"."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland.  I have been there multiple times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   Great beer list, fresh juice bar, all local grown food.  I have recommended to family and friends they all enjoyed their experience.  They don't take reservations and it can get pack so plan accordingly"}
{"text":"The prosciutto wrapped dates are a must have- wide selection for those who are vegan, vegetarian, gluten free etc."}
{"text":"So I have always ordered the veggie burger at townhall. It was pretty good as usual. However I found a piece of bacon in my side of truffle fries. I was very disappointed as townhall is a vegetarian friendly place and as a vegetarian customer I expect better in the food service standards. Please be careful going forward."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a super efficient staff. Amanda was wonderful and very attentive! The chicken curry bowl was fresh, spicy and I couldn't get enough of it. The açaí bowl was incredible and very fresh although it had so much in it that it was hard to eat at some points but it was great to eat after a lot of fried food this weekend for the Cavs game. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Best in Ohio City !  Atmospere is  energetic, there is always something fun going on here..Amazing menu to select from, terrific Crepe bar.  Great staff treats you like family."}
{"text":"I have been to town hall a few times in the past, and each time the food was excellent.  I was there this past Tuesday 6/14/17.  We had a new waitress, no big deal.  I ordered a regular coke and chicken tacos.  The coke came out the color of ginger ale and I had to send it back telling the newbie waitress it does not taste or look right.  She came back 10 minutes later with a new glass...  not sure why it took 10 min to pour a new coke.  The chicken tacos were ok.  I ate around 6pm.  At 2 am, in the middle of work, not eating anything else since dinner, I began with the stomach cramping and vomiting, soon the diarrhea.  Thank God no one else came into the ER after 4:30, as I could barely move with fevers, cramps and continuous vomiting... no doubt in my mind a food poisoning.  Now I can't prove it was the tacos.  The only other food I had that day was tomato and mozzarella salad I made myself at 11:30 for lunch.  If anyone else got sick that night please reply here.

I hate to do this but Town Hall... Banned!
Thank you"}
{"text":"I went here for drinks and appetizers with friends last week... we had heard such great things about the bar and were truly looking forward to checking it out.

The ambiance is interesting, I love the open concept - it's nice to feel the air moving through the entire building.  The problem with this is that the cigar smoke also moves through the bar (however, smoking is only allowed at specific times).  They have an abundance of seating, lots of tables - and for a bar on W 25th, this is rare.  The high ceiling are great, however, they turn all the chatter into a loud babel - even on a quiet night.  At our table of 4, we had a difficult time conversing... we found ourselves raising our voices and straining to hear each other (on a weekday night)

The night we were there the entire draft system was out.  Therefore we were only able to choose from a relatively small list of bottled beer.  This was not a huge problem, as they did have some brews that were \"new\" to us.  Unfortunately, they were also new to our server.  When asked about one beer he said \"it's kind of like a wheat beer, except that it's not\".  With that ever so helpful bit of advice, our night spiraled down hill.  We ordered two flatbreads to share... the fig & prosciutto was overly sweet and somewhat dry (it was the better of the two, but I wouldn't order it again), the bbq chicken was nothing like what we expected, it was completely underwhelming.  All of the ingredients seemed right, and interesting - but it just didn't come together.  

Our server needs additional training, he was very slow, and lacking knowledge about the bar and menu.  Granted, this bar is new, and it can take awhile to learn how to provide good service.  Saving grace?  The hostess was incredibly gracious, and when I spoke with her about needing to retrain the server she was appreciative for the knowledge, and apologetic for the service.

Between the 4 of us we ordered 1 bourbon, 1 cocktail, 2 beers, and 2 flatbreads... our receipt (which took forever to get) was well over $60.  It was not itemized, and we are 100% sure that our server padded the bill with an extra drink (we did the math a few times, but had taken our friends out and didn't want to cause a scene).  

I wanted to give this business 1 star, however - many of our friends have said that the experience we had was not a good representation of townhall.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and give it 2 stars... advice?  check your bill, and check them out in a month or two when their servers have more experience."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thy TH brunch! It's been our tradition to hit up TH for brunch on New Years Day. Calling ahead to get a reservation is always a good idea as it can get quite busy. OSU was playing so most people were sticking around. Kayla and Dan were very helpful in getting our party in on such a busy brunch day. 

I love how the brunch menu has something for everyone. Gluten Free, Vegan, dairy free, carnivore, etc. I went with the classic OHC Benedict. One of my favorites. As always, the dish did not disappoint. The potatoes that come with are crispy and flavorful. Ask for a side of rosemary aioli to compliment the potatoes. 

My wife and son shared the sweet potato pancakes and they loved it! Lots of cakes with just the right amount of syrup.

Our server was efficient and attentive. She ran over the menu and listed off great drink selections. The place was packed per usual, but our food still came out pretty quick.

My biggest compliment is that they are kid friendly. Balloons and activities were nice to keep our 3 year old occupied.  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. Good prices. 

Although the server was a bit slow today, she was very kind and respectable. Today, I decided to go with the harvest bowl (chicken substituted the bacon) and the portion was large. 

My friend wanted the chicken club, unfortunately they were out of some ingredients so she got the cashew crushed tenders with sweet potato chips. 

For her birthday, we got a yummy cookie skillet for free. Although, it would've been nice if others sang happy birthday for her. The sparklers on the cookie skillet was a nice touch + the scoop of ice cream"}
{"text":"not for wholesome dine in experience due to very slow service. Food's descent. Good for drinkin experience. The resto's suppose to give yelpers a free high five whatever that is but the server dont know what that is. A hand slap?? i didnt get it :P"}
{"text":"If I were to recommend a restaurant in Cleveland to someone from out of town and wanted to demonstrate to them that Cleveland is, contrary to popular belief, not a boring and tepid city, Townhall would be at the top of my list.  Visiting from Pittsburgh with the mindset that Cleveland is just a second-rate Pittsburgh - turns out Ohio City (the area Townhall is located in) is actually pretty hip and trendy.  Ohio City has all the upcoming new restaurants and young people spend weekend nights here if not in the flats.  
Townhall has an excellent selection of drafts and even has a color coded beer menu to categorize each beer into ales, IPAs, sours, pilsners etc. for those who know what they are looking for and want to scan the menu quickly or for those who are not as familiar with beer and need a helping hand.
Atmosphere is very trendy - wooden paneled walls with sectional rooms with ceilings of different heights, multiple bars and low lighting.  On a Tuesday night, this place was packed and loud but not in a detrimental way in the least.  The tables are far enough away from each other and patrons sit close to each other so that conversation is easy.  
Our table ordered the truffle fries for an appetizers and they did not disappoint. For dinner I had the fish tacos which definitely packed more of a spicy punch than anticipated, but I enjoyed them a great deal"}
{"text":"To start we came in for a little snack. We had our daughter with us, so we asked to have a low top table. The hostess rolled her eyes at us after sitting us at a high top table. Eventually she told us to go to the other side of the restaurant. Supposedly this is a serve yourself kind of joint, which we were fine with. We ordered drinks and lettuce wraps. The drinks never came out until after our food, after we asked for them again. The portions were little, and the rice wasn't cooked. I'm sure it would have been ok, if the hostess didn't have an attitude with us to start. I'm just really disappointed, I expected a lot better."}
{"text":"Super shocked based on the good reviews! Illattentive and slow service. My food was overcooked.  Maybe brunch was a bad time to go, but, if I can help it, I will never go back for any meal."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. During daylight hours, this place is relaxing and a cool spot to hang out.  However, the two nights I've been here (in the summer) this place becomes weird. Place was full of cologne-sprayed boys (I'm being nice) and  I was a part of a handful of women. And it was just too crowded. Maybe I'm just getting old, but this place is great during the day. At night...."}
{"text":"A bartender served me a gluten free beer without mentioning it was gluten free after I asked about it. It tasted like garbage. And the place smelled like dirty rags."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon the menu changes over at 2pm. We waited for the lunch menu to take effect and I ordered the zucchini noodle bowl with steak. It's DIVINE. Amazing flavors. Can't wait to return and try other things."}
{"text":"Great for brunch. Not a huge fan of the evening scene, which is a bit of a meat-market, but love the brunch. The tomoto soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"Adam and I came here to have a small snack while on the road and left very happy. 

We walked in and walked towards the back where there is a counter where we could order. We ordered the nachos and some garlic fries. We were given a number and got to pick out a table. 

We picked a table towards the front next to a water station and some board games. The water station was cool because you could pick from different types of water which is pretty much unheard of. This is the only place I have ever been to that has this feature. The games were cool too. We did not play any but did glance at the cards for the never have I ever and enjoyed laughing. 

Our food came out quickly and we were very happy with our choices. The garlic fires were heavenly and just the perfect amount of garlic that if I asked my husband to smell my breath he wouldn't keel over and die but you still got the flavor. The nachos were a perfect mate as the flavors of those all mixed well with the fries. They were loaded and delicious! Our food was gone in about 15 minutes and they were a great 15 minutes. 

The restaurant had a cool vibe and I know that if I lived in the area I would want to be a regular here. I know I could see myself enjoying all of the drinks they serve along with trying so many different items on their menu. 

Overall, Adam and I were very ahoy with the decision to come here and we would totally come back again. I suggest it, especially for some fun time with friends."}
{"text":"If you have a group with different dietary needs, look no further.  Townhall has a big menu, a big space, and consistency.  It's all dog-friendly, vegan-friendly, diet-friendly... just not entirely budget-friendly, depending on what you get.  Their coffee drinks are also a plus.  I love the adult espresso shake, but I doctor the ingredients a little more to my liking.

Staff is friendly and owner loves dogs.  My recommendation is to come anytime except after 8pm on a weekend."}
{"text":"CREPES....amazing these things are amazing. Love this place. Haven't tried the sweet one but the savory crepe is awesome"}
{"text":"This might be one of the best places to hang out during the summer with plenty of patio space in the rear as well as some facing W. 25th. Plus they are able to fold back the walls on both sides creating a very airy inside.

The tables are geared toward communal gatherings which is popular with the aferwork/pregame crowds. So, yeah, it's a fun ambiance.

They also have an extensive beer list but I'm more into the cocktails and those are quite original. I went last week and I jumped into the \"Sandyfornication,\" consisting of honey vanilla vodka and pomegranate, apricot simple syrup, apple cider vinegar and orange juice -- an appreciatively complex way to get a sweet and tart taste of summer.

Jeannene and I each shared an order of braised beef tacos (3 for $12) and rock shrimp tacos (3 for $14). The beef was tangy goodness and the hunks of avocado added just enough creaminess without overwhelming the dish. The peppers and other toppings added just the right amount of taste without stealing the spotlight from the meat. The shrimp was quite the same with the perfectly cooked protein being complimented by the fresh lettuce and other toppings and tangy sauce. We had a side of chips and pico de gallo with one dish and truffle fries with the other. The chips were thick but not greasy while the fries were so well seasoned you didn't really need the ketchup.

One other thing -- in a crowded bar/restaurant, the waitstaff can go missing a half-hour at a time. But Townhall appears to have developed a perfect strategy because our waitress seemed to have tables spread all over the place but she was still checking in on us like every 5-10 minutes. Other bars should look into what these guys are doing."}
{"text":"Big beer selection. Lively atmosphere and usually very crowded during the weekend. The patio is very nice in the summer. Tried their curry noodle dish and I was not a fan. The curry is very powdery and the flavor was weak. The music is too loud for people to hear each other at the same time there is no space for you to dance."}
{"text":"There's a reason its always so packed here. Five bucks for all craft beers, outstanding food, and a great atmosphere. 

It gets very busy, as it's become the place to be on weekend nights. Go for happy hour, and stay all night!"}
{"text":"Townhall is great. Perfect location on west 25th St. in in Ohio City. I love the outside patio. The food is always fresh. They have a nice selection of beer on tap and great mixed drinks."}
{"text":"The man & I were excited to stop back at Town Hall again since the first time (opening day) we had excellent service & the food was okay.  We figured we'd give brunch a go.  I wish we hadn't.

Our server, while nice, was HIGH AS A FREAKIN' KITE!  And yes, she kept talking about the SuperMoon that was happening.  Uh, sweetie, maybe you could bake when you get home, not wake & bake.

The Bloody Mary took 5 years to come & then whoa, there was NO BOOZE in it.  No spice.  Nothing.  While the tomato juice in there was great, the rest was very lacking.

I had to ask for water refills.  Asked for lemons got limes.  The food took a million years too.  When it did come 3 people ran the food to us.  The boy carrying mine passes my plate to me across the table in stead of moving his feet & coming around to place the plate on the table.  Seriously kids, this is a restaurant, do you know what service is?  I can take the plate, but that's not the point.

I ordered a Benedict, & it was pretty tasty.  The bacon I asked for crispy was not crispy in the least.  My beau enjoyed his meal & the sweet potato pancake (even if he thought it was too dense).  While the food wasn't bad, the rest of the experience was so pathetic that I was angry & annoyed by the time I left.  

While waiting terminally for my food I witnessed a \"manager\" reprimanding service personnel  on the dining room floor.  Come on guys!  That is rude to your employee & incredibly tacky for your guests to watch.

Overall, I'm disappointed and will consider other places before I go back.  I love that CLE has expanded and is opening their palates to other places, but if the management can't get their act together, or have their team execute appropriately it will be another empty hole in 6-9 months.  Town Hall you have WORK TO DO!"}
{"text":"Eat the bacon wrapped dates.  I liked that they let us sample different beer from their long list before having to commit to one. Eat the wrapped dates.  I also liked how they opened both the front and back walls to let an awesome summer breeze flow through. If you don't get the dates you could get the chicken nachos they are tasty too.  Eat the dates."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat/drink in Ohio City. Incredible food, great beer selection, and an amazing focus on the quality of ingredients in everything they serve. If you come to Cleveland and don't visit Townhall your truly missing out on an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Took a colleague who was in town from Malaysia here Friday night. The garage doors were open and we sat at the wood plank bar. No detail was missed in putting together this unique bar and restaurant. The menu was a little off-putting since it's a lot of healthy fare and I wasn't expecting that having not check beforehand. My colleague loved the beer selection as he said they don't have much of a selection back home. He also loved sitting at the bar because that isn't usual in Malaysia either. 
I had the Boulevard unfiltered wheat beer on draft which was wonderful and their 100% grass fed bolognese on spaghetti squash. I was in love! Now, I want to make that at home. It came with a poached egg on top which I thought unusual, but it was delightful. 
Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I was back for an event at Townhall, and what an improvement! I enjoyed soft tacos with veggies and tofu. They were stellar. Guacamole was served at this particular event as well along with chips. Tasty guac, light and crisp chips. On this same visit, I ordered a carrot/orange juice from the juice bar, and it was delicious. Very good experience this time at Townhall. And the best part--I won four $25 gift certificates to enjoy the restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"This is has \"fake\" good food. They advertise non gmo and \"come in here to eat right\" but don't be fooled. It is not good in any way not healthy at all. I ordered the Thai Peanut Bowl and it came out looking like a wet bowl of rice. I also ordered the Bangkok Crazy noodles, this dish was not eatable. It was so salty and sour that I thought a 5th grader may have invented it in the back and the waitress brought it out to me. I did not eat even a fourth of the bowls. After the meal I felt extremely tired and sleepy like I would after eating terrible fast food Chinese food."}
{"text":"Basically a Hooters in disguise. Hot bartenders (job requirement) but no knowledge of beer. This place is all hype."}
{"text":"Great addition to West 25th Street and Cleveland!

Last night was my second visit to Town Hall and I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service.  I had organized a happy hour for a friend's promotion and had no idea how many attendees to expect.  The restaurant was very easy to work with and reserved some tables on their gorgeous back patio for our group.

We had about 12 people in attendance.  Most of the women ordered wine or one of their autumnal cocktails - I had the apple sangria and it tasted like fall should taste.  The guys all ordered beer and I have one tip regarding that.  When you order, don't remember your beer by the number on the menu (there are many!).  The servers deliver the beer by the name and everyone looks around like a deer in headlights, trying to remember what they ordered.

In regards to the food, the flatbreads were popular.  My favorite was the fig and prosciutto - amazing!  The prosciutto wrapped dates were also a hit.  

Lastly, our server Chris was awesome.  So attentive to our group, quick and very friendly.  I love how the servers submit our orders off a handheld device so no need to find a computer near the kitchen.  Really a time saver for them.  

All in all, it was a great night.  I even received a follow up e-mail this morning thanking our group and letting us know they'd love to see us again.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hit or miss experiences. Food is always good, service is spotty at times. If you're only there to drink the crowd may be your thing depending on the night."}
{"text":"Loved it, great brunch menu and amazing draft beer selection!  First time in Cleveland and will definitely tell others about it."}
{"text":"Great healthy restaurant with amazing service. We take all of our friends to TownHall when they come to visit Cleveland. It's a must go. Never any issue with any dietary restrictions. Paleo and vegan friendly. We dig it and love going."}
{"text":"An awesome craft beer selection and a comfortable seat at the bar make for a very good afternoon here. Attentive bar staff ensured I did not run dry of lovely brew. Ordered the Townhall Veggie Burger and it was awesome for sure. Met two gentlemen from London sitting beside me and their stories were very entertaining. I always meet interesting people at Townhall, try it for yourself & maybe I'll see you there one day, there is definitely something for everyone here...cheers!"}
{"text":"Love this spot, perfect for everyone. Great for those who love craft beers, good wine and a decent liquor selection. Food is varied, with health conscious a top consideration but able to get anything from vegan (yay!) to fried chicken. Hang out with friends, catch the game or have a quick lunch, you won't be disappointed. Look for Patrick behind the bar, he's pretty fun."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a nice Sunday during an Indians game. We sat inside because there was a wait for outside seating. The atmosphere was nice enough, and our waitresses (one was training) were attentive and polite. I was tempted to get the make your own crepe deal, but went instead with the wakey Wakey. It came with eggs how you want, thick cut maple bacon, and a fresh biscuit with homemade honey butter and preserves. It was all pretty good, I liked the biscuit the best because you could tell it was fresh baked and the butter and jam were nice. I also ordered the watermelon beer, I forget specifically what it was called. It was nice and light for a perfect brunch accompaniment.  My fiancée had a brunch burger with an egg on it and truffle fries. The truffle fries were delish. He was surprised when his burger came with no top bun, but didn't remember if it said that on the menu and he misread it or if it was truly just a surprise. He's not one to eat a burger with a fork and knife, but he had to. They also cooked his burger right to medium rare, which restaurants will often say okay to when he orders it that way and then it shows up medium well. So he was happy about that. 

All in all, it was a nice experience. Just nice--I think we were a bit mislead by the pictures on here. I was wanting a good burger or wrap with fries when we went in and I guess I didn't realize that weekends are a brunch menu only? That was a little disappointing I guess, not a lot of regular lunch choices even though it was 2 PM. I also think this is perhaps not the place for you if you're looking for meat choices. My fiancée is a big fan of burritos and considered the breakfast burrito until he realized there was no sausage, chorizo, bacon, aka breakfast meat option. Lots of the dishes seemed that way...full of fresh organic ingredients to meet any food allergies or diet lifestyle requirements, but not a lot of typical choices for us regular meat eaters still left out there."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  I want to meet my friends here and I want to watch football games here and drink the fantastic beer offerings, fresh and dietary forward cuisine offerings. This place just has it. It is located on W25th basically at the market and is always busy. 

This trip I had a sour beer with friends and bone broth. It's basically a salty, belly warming soul renewal beverage of all that is Cleveland.  It's just one of the many treasures this place offers and it's why I will keep coming back. 

Brunch is becoming a thing everywhere, but Townhall has the Cleveland market cornered. Socially forward, politically local and just a great place to be. 

I woke up singing \"I Love this Bar\" this morning."}
{"text":"Noise level at dinner is crazy. Definitely not having good convo over dinner, if that's what you're looking for. 

I had the veggie burger and side salad. The burger itself had decent flavor and texture. The salad was served on the plate with my burger with a very runny, bland dressing. Needless to say, the dressing took over the plate and left me with a soggy bun. 

My husband had the Kobe burger and veggies. Again, the burger itself was seasoned and cooked OK. The veggies were a lovely frozen mix. No, really, I'd put money on having been served frozen mixed veggies. Sad. 

My mojito was on par with most bar/restaurants. 

The truffle fries must be made ahead. Our first order was room temp and chewy. Our second order, after requesting a replacement, the same. 

If you're looking for a hip place to have drinks with friends, I'm sure it will suffice. If you want a nice dinner, find another location."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service.

Our party of six sat down at a trapezoidal table with a hole in the middle of it, on various benches and stools that were a bit too high for the table. I appreciate that they are being modern and hipster but, the seating arrangement was a bit awkward and uncomfortable. The rest of the decor was cool, I guess.

The food here was great, but overpriced. We tried the lettuce wraps and smashed avocado. Lettuce wraps were really good, there were three sauces to try, but there was simply not enough lettuce to go around and the rest of the ingredients had to be eaten by themselves. For 12 dollars they could include at least some more lettuce to put stuff in. The smashed avocado is basically guacamole and chips, the guac was seasoned really nicely. Now, you have to understand that me saying that lettuce wraps are good is more meaningful than you might think. I am a meat guy - I have probably never eaten a lettuce wrap or anything that vaguely resembled a lettuce wrap before, but my mother and cousins wanted to try it, and it was a hot day and I felt like I needed something refreshing.

For the entree I tried the lamb kefta burger. It was really good, the meat was rich, the tzatziki goat cheese and pickled red onions provided a nice contrast to each other - a nice fresh crunch along with a pleasant creaminess. Although not the best lamb burger I've had, it was satisfying.

What wasn't satisfying was the server - she was very unfriendly and seemed like we were bothering her with everything we asked. Two of us ordered a second beer right before our entree and it never came, and we were charged for it. They took it off the bill of course, and she mentioned she had a \"drink runner\" and we should have let her know, but after our entrees came, we never saw her again until it was time for the bill, so we couldn't have let her know anyway. It may not be the server's fault entirely, but there was clearly some sort of miscommunication."}
{"text":"Towmhall has a nice atmosphere but arrived at 3pm and there was a wait for a table and there were at least 12 tables available. Don't have enough staff to handle the volume or seating system or staff is not working right. Brunch ends at 3 and linch starts at 4 on Saturday???  Only 5 tasters available from 3 to 4?  Ran out of menus as well. At least bartender Justin's service was excellent. The blond bartender is she should find another job. Unfriendly. Not that impressed."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS.  I was there yesterday for a very late lunch at 4PM.  Waiting at the hostess station for 10 minutes while 2 servers walked past me and my friend.  SECOND time this type of shit has happened at this place.  Do yourself a favor as we did, and wait until 5PM when the Flying Fig opens.  Much better service, much better food, and lots less attitude.  Wish Yelp had a negative star rating, that's what Town Hall would get from me.  In this case 1 star is as low as it goes."}
{"text":"My patiopalooza reviews continue.

The outdoor patio definitely gets a 5! I feel like I'm in California when I sit in the back patio. Plenty of tables and couches for lounging. It's a very comfortable place.

The inside is also great - modern lines, wood interior. There is a \"cafe\" side which is for quick eats, and they have stacks of magazines on the wall. The cafe side has a leisurely pace.

Food: 3.5 their food is casual fusion. I had the thai bowl with tofu - pretty decent size and I had leftovers for the next day. They give a lot of brown rice though to fill you up. The flavors are pretty good. Not too mind-blowing, but good enough. My beau had the metta bowl, which he liked! Lots of shredded chicken and quinoa. 

Service: 3.5 They haven't gotten the best reviews for service, but they are trying really hard!

Crowd: 2 Not a very diverse crowd. Not that I feel super in my own skin anyway in Ohio City, or and many times Cleveland in general... Maybe if they diversify their staff (going away from blonde thin women)?"}
{"text":"My only recommendation: order food on UberEATS and enjoy from the comfort of your own home. I know the bustling, trendy atmosphere is appealing to many but I have been twice now (Friday night and a Saturday afternoon around 1:30pm) and both times were packed. People seemed to be enjoying themselves but I just thought it was crammed.

However, the food was delicious! They offer a wide variety of standard, paleo, and vegan fares so you can find something for anyone in your group. They also use organic, responsibly grown ingredients and their prices are reasonable. We have had their street tacos which had tons of flavor, Thai peanut bowl which was rich and extremely filling with fresh vegetables, and their drip coffee which is apparently tested and free of mycotoxins (I learned something here!).

I definitely recommend the food but if you want a quiet, relaxed atmosphere, do not come here on the weekend. I'm sure it's okay on a weekday afternoon, but I haven't tried it at that time so I can't say for sure."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around the holidays, very busy! Hard to find a table to sit at if that's what you're going there for, but if you're going for the bar i highly recommend it! Very big bar area, a lot of standing room. I like that they have seltzer water on tap for you to get yourself. They have very unique mixed drinks also! Pretty cool atmosphere, and very cool patio in the back."}
{"text":"Townhall has never failed to impress me. With a very diverse menu that is sure to please everyone you bring. 

 The atmosphere is cozy, yet trendy without being pretentious. The patio is lovely, and the inside is spacious and airy, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"So as a visitor from Milwaukee, I paid this place a visit only because I focus on good healthy eating destinations while traveling. I asked the Renaissance hotel staff and they confirmed my online research that this was the only place to go for delicious healthy food, killer ambiance and a staff that's knowledgeable. To top it off, they were Paleo friendly and served no GMO in their scratch cooking. I am also a fan of cold press healthy beverages and Bingo, this place makes them fresh. 
What do I recommend? Curry chicken bowl, organic burger cooked medium rare, brunch options such as their guacamole on toast w fresh tomatoes, sweet potato pancakes and of course their fresh made crapes. 
Why do I know so much about this place? Because I ate there almost every day! Walk down the street to Mitchell's  while you're there if you like vegan ice cream. Cool spot! Also the public market is nice too. Kudos to the owner for hiring a special staff and killer vibe. I'll be back, but when I get back to my hotel I'm getting a delicious espresso at Rebol across from my hotel!"}
{"text":"What a cool looking spot.  The interior of this place is just very well done.  The mile long bar along the wall is just beautiful.  The sidewalk seating also was cool.  

Although they don't have their own beers, which somehow I expected, as they were nestled amongst so many breweries (yeah, assumptions... I know...), they have a nice selection along the back wall.  The menu looked fun.  Wish I'd tried it, as I ended up at Great Lakes in a tragic call of poor judgment on my part.  Sorry, I digress.  

The bartender was friendly, and fairly attentive.  We were there in the afternoon, so it wasn't very crowded yet.  

I will have to go again, and try the food."}
{"text":"Met a friend for brunch to enjoy our annual Christmas libation. What a really enjoyable day. We got lucky and got 2 seats at the bar. The bar was really busy, yet nobody had an empty glass in front of them. Bartender Erica was so friendly, accommodating, and damn did she know about all of the beers to choose from. She made several suggestions that hit the bullseye. The food was delivered quickly and was delicious. We will definitely return again soon."}
{"text":"Town Hall is definitely an Ohio City staple. It's the perfect place to hang out for a few beers, grab some brunch on the weekends, or enjoy one of their special dinner menus during the week. 
They have one of the best beer selections around. Something like 40 beers on draft, and they're constantly changing. The beer menu also provides great descriptors of each draft, and for only 5 bucks each, it's a great opportunity to sample some awesome brews. Lately they've had Luna Ginger kombucha on draft and it's amazing. Monday night the beers are even cheaper, I think $3?
They also have awesome food and a large menu that accommodates nearly all dietary restrictions. A majority of the menu items can be veganized or vegetarianized. They use great quality idgredients- organic, local, non GMO. During the week they offer special menus like vegan, paleo, etc. 
My favorite time to hang out at Town Hall is for Sunday brunch. It can be a little crowded but we usually just grab a drink at the bar while we wait for our table (you can also eat at the bar). They have a great brunch cocktail menu- the homemade Bloody Mary is delicious. And the brunch menu itself is great, a lot of options to please everyone. They also have a make your own crepe bar that I've been meaning to check out. 
Overall, a great place to check out for basically an occasion and any meal. They offer something for everyone which keeps a lot of people, myself included, coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place was hopping. Big place and plenty of people of a variety of ages. Plenty of beer on tap. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really what more could you want?! This place is amazing! And with the close proximity to home, you can find me here at least twice a week. Whether it be for brunch (crepe bar!!), lunch or dinner, it's always more enjoyable when you know you're enjoying a quality meal. Townhall is working towards being completely nonGMO, the first restaurant I've heard of doing this in Cleveland. And with all the vegan and gluten free options, the possibilities are endless!

One of my favorite things about this place, aside from the comforting decor and friendly staff, is their attention to creating quality cocktails (ask about their emulsified cocktails - they're like smoothies for adults!) and providing Cleveland with 36 all American craft beers and 80+ whiskeys and bourbons. Have I died and gone to heaven?"}
{"text":"Another great visit to Townhall!  We stopped in last night before a show at Playhouse Square.  We know that we'll have to pay for parking near the show so we always like to find somewhere for dinner where we don't have to pay to park.  The lot behind Townhall is perfect for a weeknight visit.  I'm sure it is busy on the weekends but it's a convenient (and free!) place to park on a weeknight.  

Although the restaurant was busy, we were quickly seated and a server showed up at our table shortly after.  We ordered some beers and I had one of their specialty drinks.  I don't remember the name (sorry!) but it's made with watermelon and it was delicious!  Highly recommend!  The beer drinkers in the group were very happy with the extensive selection of beers.

The menu is a little funky but I've always liked what I order.  I have the zucchini noodles with a read meat sauce (again -- I'm sorry I can't remember the name!).  It was a little spicy and very tasty.  The others in my party had burgers and they said they were some of the best burgers they've ever had!

The outdoor patio looked very inviting and we'll certainly give it a try next time.  Thanks for a great evening, Townhall!"}
{"text":"I work at a nearby hospital and our Sunday lunch and dinner choices are few. This is an updated review. I posted about a less than ideal experience and got a quick response which I appreciated greatly. I convinced my coworkers to give the place another try. I was very happy with my burger, which was cooked perfectly with tasty toppings. They took the time to fix something special for my friend who's on a restricted diet, and recooked the burger when it wasn't done as she'd asked. So I am again a happy customer. Thanks, Townhall!"}
{"text":"Friday night... I absolutely destroy my body. I wake up Saturday at 8 AM clinging to the floor, head throbbing, and echoes of music from the night before ringing through my brain. I am dying. I am dying from a hangover and I want to die. I drink a ginger-ale and vomit it, and the rest of the chemicals I put in my body the night before out. I am literally about to die from a satanic hangover.

Then I go to TownHall... The waiters and waitresses notice I'm dying and approach me with caution. I throw half-dead zombie looks at my surroundings. Someone calmly slides my bone broth and coffee in front of me. I stare at it.... sniff it... and then eventually drink it. Sometimes two bone broths. Then, I order my food... my Eggs Benedict. My savior. My Bone Broth and Eggs Benedict cured my Satanic Hangover... and what was once a body filled with toxicity and death is now filled with nutrients and healthy, fresh, food.

I leave TownHall no longer dead, but alive. I no longer want to die. Thank you Town Hall.

Overall, this place is incredible. Great food, service, and hours. Late night gets a bit packed, but they do it all. It's also conveniently located right next to the West Side Market. It's a staple."}
{"text":"I love this place. Town Hall is a chill bar and restaurant with an awesome beer list and seriously delicious food. I've eaten here 4 or 5 times over the last year and a half and it's been a consistently good experience. When the weather is nice, sitting outside is a treat (especially if there's music playing). I love that the beer list is categorized nicely so you can easily pick out the type that you like (gluten free, fruity, hoppy, tart, etc.). On Monday, my fiancé and I went to Town Hall for vegan night. We shared the jalapeño poppers (very spicy), the beer battered avocado tacos (delicious, but maybe needed more spice or pizzazz) and the chimichangas (perfecto!). Other times we've come here, we've really enjoyed the tofu food truck tacos and the veggie burger. Anyway, check this place out. It'll likely be crowded so be prepared to wait (but it'll be worth it)."}
{"text":"I have been going to TownHall on Mondays for the past few weeks. I love their Vegan night, especially the delicious vegan desserts! I also thought it was pretty cool how TownHall is doing pop-up-shops, where they feature local artists items for sale inside the store. I got a bracelet a few weeks ago :) Overall, the service is great, and I'll definitely be back. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Love the environment, dislike the food! Townhall is a quirky, high-energy bar with a ton of seating space to enjoy the company of your friends and/or live music! If you're planning to come here for dinner, your best option is to go elsewhere in Ohio City for MUCH better food and then come here after for some drinks! My friends and I came here for dinner, and we were pretty disappointed. Items on the menu are all extremely unique, but don't let their uniqueness fool you. The items I've tried were suuuper bland! I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl. Meh. The veggies were poorly cooked and the bowl lacked flavor! This is something I could make in the comfort of my own home. I  don't think anyone likes to eat out for food that they can make on their own for a fraction of the price! I've also tried Spicy BBQ Chicken flatbread. Again, meh. Too much bread and not enough flavor! 

The one thing I do like about this place is that it has a juice bar! Yay for fresh and healthy drinks! I ordered the Sunrise, which includes carrots, ginger, lemon and orange. Definitely a bit on the sour side with a strong ginger taste, but I enjoyed the freshness of the juice!"}
{"text":"Town Hall is a lot of fun, but the waitress Eilish is the best part. She's so accommodating, kind, and easy to talk to. The place is great for drinks, but definitely ask for Eilish."}
{"text":"Like the outdoor patio! Paleo and Whole30 options!!"}
{"text":"If you have food allergies they're probably the most considerate place I've been, they ask for allergies before they even take your order. Menu is very clear about allergens/gluten. Inventive menu, make your own crepe station, yummy mimosas. Ambience is amazing, great outdoor space with high tops and cabana style booths, full of greenery. Indoors is equally nice, very long, free form wood bar and high and low top tables. Minimal wait if you get there before 10 am for brunch, come late and it gets super busy. Well trained and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"food is great, beer selection is OUTSTANDING, and i dont even really drink beer (lol) but if i were an beer lover this would be my joint. Their menu is normal bar food, but they are gluten friendly WOOHOO The vegetarian/vegan options are great and the drinks are delicious, too. The ambience is nice, inviting, warming, cool place to just hang out for a sunday afternoon meal.

The portabello BLT are freaking, i dont even really have a word actually, AMAZING. packed with so much flavor, and so elegantly put together. makes my mouth water writing this review. They have a kids menu but its kind of the pits, they could definetly do a better job if they wanna make this a full family restaurant. I had the tacos ( what else is new) they were decent, for the price i felt they could have had a little more meat and fillings but nonetheless i was full and satisfied.

my 4 star rating, as per usual, is because of the service!! It was a friday afternoon, before the dinner rush, so i honestly dont know why service was so slow. We werent greeted by our waitress for 15 minutes, and then we felt a bit rushed during service. Im normally an awesome tipper, but the service just did not cut it for me this time around. Im actually a bit saddened because the food and overall experience was amazing, but that service issue might prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"Very loud, but very fun atmosphere. Truffle fries were solid, NY flank steak w/ street corn was great. Worth the hype as a lively upscale bar + health-oriented spot."}
{"text":"What a great place to meet friends and have a great meal.  The most amazing draft beer selection anywhere. The food is incredible, non GMO and supporting local business.  Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday,  luckily we arrived just before noon and beat the crowd.  Food was good , service was good.  Coffee took forever to arrive but our waitress did come over to apologize.  We were seated under a fan which blew so hard our hair was blowing around. 
  I had the cheese sticks and soup. Soup was delicious the sandwich was not.  It was served on a slab of wood and I think it had sat too long, the underneath was soggy. Add in the cool air from the fan and you get cold soggy grilled cheese. My partner ordered the Bangkok bowl, really good but at the bottom all of the spice pooled and was really hot. Our waitress did warn us it was spicy but we grow ghost peppers so this didn't concern us.  
All in all , it's a three out of five."}
{"text":"Grade: A++ (It did so well, it deserves a scholarship.)

Inspirational and creative culinary creations, solid service, AMAZING patios, beautiful people, fair beer prices, and a decor unparalleled in both design and execution. The food is good, yet not heavy, thanks to fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Also openly vegan, vegetarian, and/or gluten-free friendly!

#TownHallMakesMyHeartSing"}
{"text":"Food was good once it got to us--waited about 45 minutes for it to come. That wasn't the worst thing though--they allowed dogs in the restaurant--not the outside porch but actually in the restaurant. And the dogs' owner let them sit on  benches right next to where people were sitting. I actually saw a waitress holding a customers food and petting the dogs at the same time. All the staff just kept petting them and walking into the kitchen. When I explained to the hostesses that this was unsanitary and in violation of Ohio health codes they could not have cared less. We won't be back."}
{"text":"this place is always poppin. good music. good beer. the food is decent. hipster-y and fresh. brunch is good. good bloody marys. they have a crepe bar. appetizers are awesome."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Along with a ton of American Craft beers to choose from... what can be better? If you haven't been here, you need to check it out! Try the truffle fries, tenders, and dates as an appetizer! Thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Great vibe + loud crowd for a game + $5 craft brews all the time + passable food menu (with a good deal of healthy options to offset all those pints!) = perfect setting for the game 

If you like porters and Reese's pieces, try the willoughbys peanut butter cup beer, good stuff!"}
{"text":"I worked nearby and had the opportunity of coming with a few friends. On my fist visit I loved the food. I ordered their house burger and it was tasty not to mention  their truffle fries are amazing. I was excited to bring my boyfriend since I had such a pleasant experience on my first visit. I ordered the street tacos and they were blah. The cheese tasted too pungent and I did not care for the food. My boyfriend ordered the lamb and he was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. His was amazing! Decent place hit or miss with food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food with healthy and local options, fresh juice, smoothies, desserts, awesome coffee/espresso, giant beer and whiskey list. If you're in Cleveland you gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Townhall is one of those places you go when you're looking for something different.  Stop in here when you're sick of the plain and ordinary and you will find what keeps people truly coming back for more."}
{"text":"Food is great but service always sucks from hostess to servers & food runners... customer service skills severely lack!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Townhall a few times now and every time it's been a pretty solid experience. While I've never really eaten a meal, I can share based on their drinks and apps. They have a huge assortment of beers to choose from. Many come straight from Ohio. I was shocked to see one of my favs from Jackie O's in Athens, Ohio on the menu. As with many bars like this, you're welcome to try a beer before you purchase (this is always so helpful)! I've also indulged in their truffle fry appetizer. It comes out in a cute little tin with parmesan cheese on top and two tipping sauces. This definitely hit the spot! Next time I'm in CLE and I stop by, I'll be sure to try some of their vegetarian options. I was super stoked to see they had so many creative items on the menu. Until then!"}
{"text":"Place had a great vibe. The service was amazing along with the food. It's really great at night time and they have this Thursday thing that I am definitely coming back for. It's the type of place you go out to once a month for those special occasions honestly. The prices are kind of high for me but so worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is the best on W25th and the atmosphere is exactly what I'm looking for when entertaining friends from out of town. 

Best brunch in town (best BACON ever) and was just introduced to their Monday night craft beer night. 30 some beers on draft at $3 a pop. Delicious. 

Give this place a whirl. Great for families during the day, great for partying during the night. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Town Hall, and I went for a business lunch. We sat at one of the high tops closest to the entrance, and I couldn't help but love the open atmosphere throughout the entire restaurant.

Most importantly, the food. I had the Power 2.0 salad and the agave ginger ale. My co-worker had the farmhouse flatbread, because 2 different waitresses claimed that was their favorite. Both of us were thrilled with our choices...I personally are way too much, but I couldn't help myself! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for brunch or lunch, even early dinner. The patio/outdoor dining space is great when the weather cooperates. It's really fun in the cafe section where they have games. However, at night time, it's like Gremlin time. If you are looking for tinder matches or divorcees, this is the place to be on a Saturday night (not judging, just not for me!). If you're trying to have some drinks and actually talk with friends without getting smashed against one another, move along to one of the other options on the street."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the place didn't smell better? ...considering the deliciousness of every-single-bite from the Townhall kitchen. Our server, Kori, was above and beyond. She truly knew her menu - both food and drink - and is probably a big reason why my boyfriend and I enjoyed our brunch SO much. Per her recommendation, I had the Southern Comfort (sweet biscuits, sausage gravy, poached egg and rosemary taters) and ermahgerd, I'm sad my sweet home Chicago is so far away. Their thick cut bacon was worth ordering as an additional side. Hey, don't you judge me, I shared! Reluctantly."}
{"text":"While this place is quite nice and spacious, and service was very attentive, the portions seemed small and the menu is just trying way too hard and comes across as pretentious for no reason. Bone broth? Turmeric everything? Bulletproof coffee? Press juice? Too much. I appreciate the effort, and will have to try coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"A wonderful beer selection and I love their happy hour Mondays!"}
{"text":"It is not everyday that you can find a contemporary alcohol serving establishment in Cleveland that is open late and also serves food that can accommodate those with restrictive diets. So, if you're looking for the standard grease-soaked fare served in most bars than you may want to go someplace else.  Townhall is unique as it is not only a bar, but also a cafe with an interesting menu that offers healthy choices ranging from breakfast items (e.g., pancakes, eggs, french toast) to more typical late-night fare (e.g.,burgers, fries).  Additionally, lunch and dinner items include soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, various bowls, and even vegan dishes, all of which provide great choices for a variety of tastes.  The cafe is not bound to caffeine either, it also offers fresh pressed juices, tasty milkshakes, decadent smoothies, and has numerous dairy-free alternatives to appease those who like lattes without the lactose. So, whether you're looking for a shot of tequila or a double shot of espresso, Townhall is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Diverse menu, beer selection is good, milkshakes are the bomb, brunch options are really good, patio is great!"}
{"text":"Best Bar in Cleveland. The Moscow Mule here will rip your dick off it's so good"}
{"text":"Usually come here later in the evening, and eat from their bar menu, which is small and somewhat limited but serves its purpose. Often we order a flatbread or sliders, or a small plate or two. 

I come here more for the atmosphere. There's always a crowd, which every now and then I enjoy and on the weekends it's nice to see the even larger crowd. 

Service has always been wonderful and the girls always talk to us about something other than the menu. 

Prices are fair, great atmosphere. I will continue to come here :)"}
{"text":"My son and I eat here after we went to the glass blowing place a few doors down  (which I strongly recommend). They recommended it sooo... What the heck.... Right?
Cool spot, good vibe, great concept. Servers were nice enough.... Not in a condescending way.... Not overtly friendly.... and thatz ok w/me.  I hate that.  
Okaaay.... I gatta say this cuz its been in a lot of reviews.... This 'hipster' idea.... I just don't get it....  I mean.... if you saaay you are indeed hip... are you? Just asken. 
 Cuz I'm not.  I'm justa  mom w/a teen looken for a bite to eat for lunch... Guess what?  
 I was comfortable here and so was my son.
 (good mom points) yea!  
So don't let this hipster vibe....( Maybe late nite crowd...?), deter you from checken this place out.
Having said that, It was 2ish... The girl at the counter.... Yuglia... ? name spelling?  She was awesome! She took the time...( l o n g  time ) Helping us with the menu .... she didn't lose it at any time.... I would have!
Appetizers, came out with the meal... The fries were cold and greasy.... The burger? meh
The. Food.   Was  a  real  let  down. bummer
I'm really disappointed.... most everything else was good..... Almost great.... 
( I feel like I'm talking to a bad lover..... )
Maybe it was the time of daaay.... The cook was on a smoke break? Who knows.
When I'm back up there, I may check it out again..... but there's a bunch of places I can go.
Good idea,  poorly executed.

{"text":"The rating is actually 3.5 but mainly because of the food. My friend and I ordered the chicken tacos and korean pork flatbread. The flatbread was good but you couldn't really taste the meat. And the tacos had too much Cole slaw in it. The food was decent. I do like the atmosphere of the place and how they have board games for large groups of people."}
{"text":"I love coming to town hall during the week for lunch. It's much less crowded than trying to squeeze in on the weekends. I got a recommendation from the bartender, Angela, to try the veggie burger. It was wonderful!  The fries beer and service were all amazing. I'll definitely be back for lunch and brunch in the future."}
{"text":"While I had only seen the inside of townhall once at 12:30 AM on a Saturday, my boyfriend and I decided to try out their food offerings at 12:30 PM on Saturday.  I'll have to admit, I was skeptical. After all, a bar with that many beers on tap and a clientele that is rather bro-ish couldn't possibly have legit food on the menu.... Right?! Turns out I was wrong. 

Let me first mention that we were seated on the back patio at one of the lower tables, so it sort of felt like we were eating at a coffee table. Every once in awhile, when the wind blew, you could get a whiff of last night's beers... Musty and drying in the sun. Not so yummy.

The menu itself was scattered- curries, bolognese, burgers, dates, juices, half chickens! Good god man! My palette was already overwhelmed. 

We decided to try out the thai peanut brown rice bowl and the paleo spaghetti squash, accompanied with coffees and coffee peanut butter porters.  The porter was fantastic (of course); the coffee was terrible (go get your coffee across the street before you come here for brunch); the food was pretty decent. The Thai bowl had lots of fresh veggies and was heavy on the ginger. It definitely could have used some spice. As for the spag squash, the \"pasta\" sauce was a bit watery, but the flavors were solid. 

Service was decent as well. Friendly hosts, attentive server."}
{"text":"Lunch today in Cleveland. This place is north of the West Side Market. 

Our group tried a number of different items. Their beef burger was excellent. The chicken was great. The zucchini cold salad was great. 

Forgot to take pictures. They do sell beers. Check this place out. It's very popular."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Town halls ambiance and decor on several occasions.  This is a place I could hang out at enjoy life for awhile. Cleveland breed Cleveland born Town hall"}
{"text":"Great Service, Food + Drinks...The late night menu is on point and so was the bartender, Kevin!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Not a big fan of the bros that frequent here, but that's not Town Hall's fault.  Love the fast-casual side too.  We've had several great meals going there."}
{"text":"Townhall is one of my go-to restaurants in the Cleveland area. I find that there are dishes that can please just about anyone's taste buds and every time I go I receive excellent service. I appreciate their commitment to quality food and ingredients as well as their dedication to people with any and all dietary restrictions. Whether you are a picky eater, a meat eater, gluten free, vegan, etc, or none of the above  they will most definitely have a meal for you! I love trying all of their different dishes and have honestly never been disappointed! Keep up the amazing work"}
{"text":"Love the crepe station. Huge beverage selection that my kids LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Healthy organic good that's fresh. We love this place and the food."}
{"text":"My colleague and I went to Townhall while in Cleveland for business. Being in the nutraceutical business we wanted healthier options than a heavy meat dinner. At the recommendation of a local we came here and weren't disappointed! We loved it here and the prices were fair. 

The menu has lots of healthy/vegan options and the waitress even asked us if we had any food allergies. If you aren't looking for food, they had a whole menu of just beers.

The atmosphere was youthful and fun and the Cavaliers were there during our visit so that was also fun."}
{"text":"The folks from the Townhall asked us back for dinner. So we decided to give them a second chance.
We came in Saturday early afternoon for dinner.
It was crowded but not as noisy or dark as the last time we were there.
We checked in and within 10 minutes the restaurant manager came to see us and was very friendly and genuine.
We were seated quickly and ordered our food. This time it came out very well prepared and very tasty.
All in all it was so much better than our last visit.
We were also surprised with an awesome vegan and gluten free hot fudge sundae that was really good.
My daughter was very happy and glad that we came back and that The Townhall really stepped up to the plate made up for what had been a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. It's normally pretty busy (or at least every time I go it is). However, I never have had to make a reservation. It's nice because t has a restaurant section and then a cafe section for quicker service. I've only done the restaurant section, but I just love the Cleveland pride everywhere. The atmosphere is always light-hearted and happy people with their friends. The TVs have all the sports games on to watch. The food is delicious. My friends and I got truffle fries which were amazing. They also have a wide variety of food options including Paleo and Vegan nights, which I think is great. Definitely recommend stopping here for a night!"}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for Town Hall yet?!?

My favorite place on West 25th, hands down. I like TH for dinner, beers, dessert, fancy drinks, late-night, the patio, you name it. The time of day you go really dictates the experience you'll have (see below).

The place itself is huge. Long wood bar, huge open dining room, another huge \"cafe\" in the other room, a large fenced-in patio out back and a smaller patio out front. Easy parking in the West Side Market lot when the market's not open. The food is great. A wide variety of all different types of cuisine, and it tends to change. I like the flatbreads, the scallops, and the burger and fries. The beer selection is top notch, and all are $5 all day, every day. The bartenders and servers are generally nice and knowledgeable. Dan, the manager, is nice and has taken good care of my running group when we stop in. They also do a good job of advertising on social media.

Now, here are a few examples of experiences at Town Hall:
- I go with my running club to sit on the patio on a Wednesday night for dinner and it's reasonably crowded but relaxed
- I go with my friends or boyfriend for a weekend dinner and it's bustling with lots of ages and types of people enjoying being out and about
- I go with my family for beers on a Saturday evening and it's packed, again with people of all ages
- I get dressed up and \"go out\" with my girls late on a Saturday night and it's the \"place to be\" for young adults
- I go on a random day to hang out at the bar and watch a sports game on TV

In summary, Town Hall is a very versatile place with a great food and a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for brunch for a birthday. I got the eggs Benedict which were really good. The hollandaise and the potatoes were amazing. The eggs perfectly poached. My mom got the coconut pancakes which were good but the sweet potato ones were even better. Finally, since it was my moms birthday they have her a large skillet cookie with a sparkler in it. I'm not joking when I say it's one of the BEST skillet cookies I'd ever had. It was still gooey on the inside and perfectly sweet and chocolaty."}
{"text":"All around great! Patio is fantastic! People are  fun! Food is interesting and fresh! AND I can bring my dog !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at in Cleveland. They have a ton of healthy menu items that are so delicious! I love their vegan night on Mondays! I am vegetarian so I love having so many different options to order from. I usually get the tacos with beyond meat \"chicken\" - if I go during brunch, I always get the parfait and avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Town Halls is the place where I goto for business and personal time. Great selection of beer and healthy drinks. TOFU Tacos are the best! Town Hall is the first place I recommend to people visiting the area looking for a good beer, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chocolate milkshake was amazing. The burger, fries and flatbread exceeded my expectations. The service was fast, and everything was clean"}
{"text":"Food was good the one time I ate there. Gets a little too crowded for my liking on weekend nights but at least there is a nice patio out back to get out from the crowd. Also, more bartenders would help."}
{"text":"I would not eat here if I was dying of the Bubonic Plague and the only cure was the food this place serves. I have never been so disgusted by a restaurant in my entire life and I have traveled much of the country, so I have had my share of good and bad experiences. 
I was eating at the cafe section of the restaurant when I overheard a conversation between a young girl working and someone who I assumed was her manager. The young girl had cut herself and was noticeably bleeding and the manager proceeded to tell her to put turmeric on it and keep working. 

My first thought? Is this woman a medical professional? What kind of cotton headed ninny muggin would suggest something so asinine? I am a medical professional and I don't even want to think about the amount of infectious bloodborne pathogens that were exposed to anyone else who chose to eat there that day. Good luck to you and may the odds be in your favor. 

My second thought? Have I suddenly been teleported into a third world country where we don't have proper medical care or where we put our public service employees into a state of forced labor when they quite clearly should not be working? 

I shop locally and support local businesses on a daily basis. If I wanted to support a sweat shop type business model that exploits its workers, I would purchase cheap fast fashion that has been hand sewn by small children and imported from India.

After telling some friends about my experience, I was actually surprised about the horror stories they had told me about former female employees and the way they were treated by management and even the owner. 

To be clear, I have eaten here before. This was not my first time, however, it most definitely was my last. The food is fine, but unless you want to support a business that disregards the health or safety of its employees or customers and treats its employees like cheap escorts, I recommend you pick somewhere else. There are plenty of great places in Ohio City that won't make you feel like you've sold your soul to Satan for a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour. The food was good and the $3 beer was even better. I ordered a black bean Burger my only complaint would be all I could taste was curry. I like curry but it's a strong spice, it needed more flavor. The chips & gauc was delicious! 
Any way we had a great time! Cleveland needs more restaurants  like this!"}
{"text":"Just wow. From the friendliness of the staff (considering we walked in 20 mins to close), the speed with which our meals hit the table, to the deliciousness of the food! Absolutely 5 stars. Very cool place. We had the sweet potatoes skins, lettuce wraps, burger and poke bowl. Yummmm. The burger was one of the best I've tasted in a while."}
{"text":"I've only been during weekdays for a quiet lunch, though I did walk in and walk out on a packed Friday evening!  A bit crowded for me. 

The food I've had has always been delicious and I love taking folks there for the 1st time! They expect a typical bar menu and are always overwhelmed at the choices.

It is definitely on my list of places to pop into lunch for, great food and a friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Wow. What an awesome night at Townhall! After my not so great experience last time I came back here for dinner and was not disappointed! I went with a friend and we ordered way too much food but left happy and full. To start we got the crudite which is a huge order of really fresh, organic veggies with an awesome olive dip and white bean kale hummus. We also ordered the seared shisitos, tiny little asian peppers seared to perfection with delicious dipping sauce. This is something I wouldn't normally order but they were amazing! The dipping sauces were perfect for these bite sized peppers. They're not spicy so they're a safe bet for even the wimpiest palate! As an entree we both ordered the lamb burgers and truffle fries. The fries were amazing (I've had them before so this was not news to me) I only had a bite of the burger because I was just so full from the apps...but I anticipate a very tasty lunch tomorrow! Finally we shared the skillet cookie....it was served with a sparkler which was a tad bit embarrassing...but we ate up that cookie and ice cream no problem!

One of the new features of the menu is that all of the food is now GMO free...which the staff is really proud of!

My friend and I had a great time with lots of wine and lots of food. The ambiance of this place is awesome...and the wait staff and manager, Ryan, were extremely friendly and wonderful!

I'll have to give the brunch another try but for dinner and drinks...Townhall is on point!!"}
{"text":"This spot has many faces....I'm reviewing on food and atmosphere during lunch, dinner and brunch. All have been amazing and keep me wanting more. The juices are refreshing. Please start with one (don't let kale mislead you - so good!). Then pick your favorite off of their expansive menu. Everything I have tried has yet to disappoint. This also goes for my co-workers and friends I have dragged over. 

Atmosphere can't be beat. Indoor, outdoor, shade, sun, breeze....take your pick. It does tend to get crowded at night so if that isn't your thing go early, try one of Cleveland's local beers on the board and have fun.

Great addition to 25th! And the growing brunch scene."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time this week. LOVED the atmosphere (seating outside out front and outside in the back. The seating inside is huge with two bars. It's all wooden and beautiful and I like how the front wall opens like a garage door so even if you're inside you get a breeze on a nice day. 

Food was delicious. I had the chicken curry noodle bowl it was delish without being too spicy. My friend has the bbq chicken flat bread that was brought out on a huge wooden cutting board. He said it was excellent. My other friend had the tomato bisque and wrapped dates (I tried a wrapped date too!) everything was excellent. Great beer list most around $5, I had one for $2.50 though. 

Service was also great. The place's marketing guy even stopped by to see what we thought and gave us his card and shook our hands. I really respect this initiative and think the attention to detail and customer feedback is a sign the Town Hall will be a success."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and wish that I had gone here sooner!  I visited Townhall for the first time today, for lunch.   The space (outside and inside) is spacious and nicely situated.  There was a pretty decent lunch crowd and since I was dining by myself, I sat at the bar and was approached within just a few moments and presented with a menu and glass of water.  The menu offers a bit of something for all tastes....salads, sandwiches, soups, starters, burgers, entrees and bowls, along with smoothies etc.   Also the price was right....most offerings were in the $9-10 range. I ordered the burrito, but was informed that they were out of tortillas.   I was a bit bummed, but the server suggested that I get the burrito contents as a bowl, accompanied by chips and salsa.  Shortly thereafter, my order arrived and the portion was more than sufficient and the presentation was on point.  The tortilla chips were still warm from the fryer and the salsa was fresh with just a bit of a kick.   Now onto the burrito bowl.  The bowl included brown rice, chicken, cilantro, red bell pepper, and a number of other ingredients.  The combination was warm, flavorful and delicious....there was a bit of a sweet component, as well as spicy.   I think that I actually prefer the bowl over the actual burrito wrap, going forward.  Also in looking at those dining around me, the meals also looked tasty and everyone seemed pleased.  I will definitely return to Townhall!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Ohio City in general, but Town Hall is probably my favorite place down there now.  In a huge beer district you expect good beer, but Town Hall's 33 drafts are amazing.  I would recommend the MIssion Blonde, it is one of their staples.  

Now to the food.  We started with avocado and chips as well as the truffle fries.  The rosemary aioli that comes with the fries was AMAZING.  It was seriously the best dip I've had with fries.  

For the meal I had the Metta Bowl which was so great.  It had a a curry sauce which was really good.  It gave it some seriously great flavor.  I've been in other times and had the burger and the fig jam flat bread.  Everything has always been really good, even outstanding.  

For dessert we had the skillet cookie.  It was giant and so moist.  I would recommend getting the ice cream on the side so it doesn't melt on top of it.  They also have some amazing cupcakes.  

And if you're not a big drinker I would suggest getting the cocoloco smoothie or anything off the juice menu.  They are all super fresh and really good.  I like the cafe side for lunch or just a quick juice or smoothie."}
{"text":"Townhall never stops amazing me!! I recently had a dinner meeting with out of town guests and we were all vey impressed with their amazing food, great drinks and outstanding service. I wanted to take my guests somewhere that really displays what Cleveland is all about. They were blown away with the whole experience and were really excited to see how Cleveland has taken off. One of the guests was celebrating her birthday, our waitress overheard and brought out an amazing desert complete with sparkling candle. I am consistently impressed with Townhall and recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"Came here on vacation... Meh. 
The good: the beer. Ooohhhh man the beer. And I didn't even sample that much. Started with the chardonnay which was great.  Had a no. 9 and a no. 25. The beer is frigging awesome. 

The atmosphere was great. Great outdoors chill vibe. 

The rest: the food was OK. I worked in NYC and Boston which is home of some of the best food so maybe I have high expectations, but when the waitress says it's the best burger she's ever had, I had high hopes. The burger sucked. So bland... I needed to drowned it in ketchup.  
For a starter, the lettuce wraps were good. The tomato bisque was very good too. I've had better burgers at five guys and shake shack. 

The service was OK. Waitress had a bit of an attitude.  Not friendly at all.
Come here for the beer. Avoid the burger."}
{"text":"Finally went back on a Monday night for craft beer night. I was meeting a friend and this time I could actually find him! There were lots of people at the bar but there were still places to sit and you could walk through the place. No blaring top 40 and loud people just a super chill atmosphere with $3 craft beers (!!!) I got 2 beers the house salad and the bread and chevre. The salad was super delicious, fresh and crisp veggies and the dressing was really balanced. The chevre wasn't very good, too salty and just very strange tasting. Generally it was a pretty good experience, definitely made me feel different about Townhall and I'll definitely be back. But not on a weekend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I was never disappointed with the food, except the last time. I get the food truck tacos, which are usually delicious, but they might have changed something or had an off day and I didn't really like them. The service was always good every time I've been here. As a bar at night it can get really, really crowded. I usually just go to get some lunch here."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go in Cleveland. I recommend reservations if you have a party of 6 or more(min req. of 6). Food is vexcelle t and not the things you find anywhere else. The plates very from burgers to Thai to vegan. They pride themselves in gluten free items along with non gmo and locally bought products. They have about 30 beers at all times to choose from and you can get growlers. The decor is also amazing with beautiful wood tables. I always take people new to the city here. And dogs are welcome on their patio during warm seasons!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and I eat here at least 4 times a month. It's insane! (i know). Anyway brunch is awesome, sweet potato pancakes with eggs Benedict is my favorite and the crepe bar is hugely popular. Their veggie burrito is to die for and every Monday they have vegan night. Coffee bar is fantastic and my favorite smoothie is Cocoloco. Even the wait staff is pretty easy on the eyes.


You wont be disappointed and the menu is really health conscious."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while looking for a late Memorial Day lunch. First of all, the place is massive with tons of seating and has an open air vibe that's perfect for summer. We sat outside in the shade and enjoyed the warm temperature and the breeze. Dogs also seem to be welcome which was an adorable surprise.

Their craft beer list is extensive and offers options from all across the country, all for $5. The waiter did a great job of describing all the different options and flavors.

The menu is equally impressive and features all non-GMO items. They also a huge variety of vegan or vegan available options. I had the vegan Burrito #2 with the simple salad as a side. This huge burrito had vegan chili, tofu, quinoa, brown rice, and avocado crema. It was SO GOOD! Maybe a little large for lunch, but you could easily take half home for dinner or lunch the next day (I just liked it too much to stop eating). I wouldn't have thought to put quinoa in a burrito, but it definitely works. The vegan chili has great flavor and just enough spice. Overall, this burrito is out of bounds delicious.

For dessert we ordered the vegan salted caramel milkshake and split it between 4 people. Not to be dramatic, but it was TO FRIGGIN' DIE FOR! So rich and creamy you wouldn't even know it was vegan. I believe it's made with coconut ice cream so it has a slight coconut taste, but as someone who doesn't care for coconut, it didn't bother me one bit. I would have easily paid $20 or my first born for this shake, but they only charge $5.

Overall, this place was incredible. From the atmosphere to the food, the whole experience was top notch. Definitely an Ohio City gem and we will be coming back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"If you're in town then this place is a must for brunch! My best friend and I loved the atmosphere and the food. The selections in the menu consisted of a wide variety of delicious meals. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ohio city has so many restaurants and it is so happening. Just a short walk from west side market on W25th street. The restaurant has two entrance, one is for the cafe which is brightly lit and good for reading or browsing. The other entrance is to the bar. It was crowded for a Friday afternoon but were seated immediately. Service is efficient. Lot of gluten free options. They have healthy and organic juices. The tomato bisque is delicious. The street tacos with spicy chicken are ok. The quantity of salsa is too little for the nacho chips. The curry chicken noodles were delicious. It's a bowl and a good portion size with the right amount of spice. Service is fast and efficient. Parking could a problem in general. Overall a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Being from Scottsdale, AZ, a major health food city, this place might be a new favorite of mine for breakfast joints. Vegan friendly, paleo friendly, and oh so delicious. Great price for the quality as well. Went almost right at 9am on a Saturday when they opened to beat the crowd since I knew it was a popular place. Almost every lyft driver recommended this place to me. Was blown away by the paleo coconut pancakes--something I've never seen offered before."}
{"text":"Revolutionized the nightlife scene on west 25th. I have been going out in Cleveland for years and I finally have found my favorite spot to spend my Friday and Saturday nights. It's a social house where I have found that the atmosphere is just right for running into old friends, having drinks with co-workers and business partners as well as a great place to meet people. They keep the music at a very reasonable level, I'm always just catching new songs that I like while still being able to carry a conversation with whoever I am with. The staff is friendly, fresh and couldn't be more helpful. There is definitely a customer service feel that you get when interacting with them. I'm not much of a beer drinker but they have many craft beers on tap which is very nice (I've tried a few and so far so good). The cocktails are amazing, I have never had anything like the Indigo's, which is some sort of pureed fruit with liquor poured on top of it (Note: I was told STIR this concoction repeatedly for the full effect). I am new to the Yelp! review thing, but I felt almost obligated to share about this place. As far as the food goes, there is a little something for everyone in my opinion. I have been working my way down the menu as best as I can. So far I haven't been discouraged from trying whatever's next. My go to's are the street truck tacos (I added jalapenos the first time and WOW), for dinner I'd recommend their Bombolotti dish, it is nothing short of cheesy fantastic-ness! All in all,  what hooked me was the scene, its upbeat, trendy, casual and fun! The place makes you feel like you are at the right place at the right time. It has definitely become one of my favorite places to eat and imbibe, whether its lunch, brunch, dinner, or party time."}
{"text":"I went to townhall townhall expecting nothing but the best from my favorite restaurant in Ohio city. I order an acai bowl for pick up and expected what you see in the first picture but ended being disappointed as you see in the second picture. This definitely makes me reconsider going here again. I was expecting a bowl of happiness instead I received a bowl of sadness."}
{"text":"If I ever was to use the word \"amazeballs,\" it  would be for Town Hall. The owner really knew what he was doing with this place. They have everything! Great patio, coffee/ juice bar, crepe station, vast menu options, healthy choices, huge beer selection, late night options, the list goes on.

You could come here for any meal and have plenty of options to choose from. I love they the menu is relatively health conscious, as well. 

My only complaint is that the bathrooms are always extra stinky than most. Oh and one more is that is seems to attract a lot of \"bros.\" I sometimes feel like I am at a classy frat party but I can live with it."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good; basil fried rice, Korean BBQ flatbread, and Bangkok bazaar are a few of my favorites. The red dawn is delicious with their weekend brunch menu! The staff has always been extremely kind and courteous. 

If you want dessert- get the skillet cookie."}
{"text":"Walked in through the back door with 4 small children and was not greeted by anyone. The hostesses are semi-friendly.... and you have to approach them, they will ignore you for a while. The male waiters are friendlier- they smiled and asked if I needed anything. I purchased 2 sandwich/soup enteees, a poke, flatbread, a coffee, 2 cookies and an apple juice which totaled $57. The food was delicious. But I am disappointed in the wait time at the restaurant.... the self-seating area is where I ended up at. In app, it was a great food experience but the ambience of the restaurant isn't my taste. The bathrooms are very dark. If they were changed to white themed- it would be much more friendlier and inviting. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I had an early supper here with friends, while interviewing a potential staff candidate at our institution.  The service was friendly, prompt and personalized.  The menu options were ok, the appetizer by my choice wasn't very good but I picked it (my fault) - wouldn't do that olive plate again.  The main course was tremendous - Tandori chicken, unbelievable flavor, presentation and a hearty portion.  The ambience is ok.  I appreciate the ability to bring children.  I'd go here again.  It was a tad expensive for what I had that night."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time over the summer and was really impressed. Service was good. A mistake was made in our order but it was fixed promptly and correctly. I loved the selection on beer. I like to try new food and the menu has a decent selection of fusions you've probably never had but still sound amazing.  The decor and atmosphere is great. Seems like all-around this place is run well from the marking crew to the wait staff. I give it two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Such a cool place.  The food is delicious. We sit and watch every dish come out of the kitchen and can't wait to go back and try the next dish.  It's always busy so don't go if your in a hurry.  The wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant gets half of the praise it does. The food is mediocre at best and the service is almost always pretentious/disinterested. On my last visit I ordered the cheeseburger and it was fine when compared to a burger from Applebee's. Definitely not what I was expecting from the reviews and notoriety this place typical gets. On previous visits I've had the fish tacos (bland) and the veggie burger (actually decent). 

Townhall's \"non-GMO\" policy seems to be a crutch for having sub-par food for exorbitant prices.

No thanks, I'll stick with the countless other, better dining options in Ohio City."}
{"text":"townhall never disappoints me. even though ive only been here a few times i always have the best experience and meal. their cocktails are so unique and crafted with the best ingredients you have to try them. i usually dont like bourbon but when i get a drink here it makes me love it! the whole menu is non gmo and they have a lot of organic ingredients. another thing i like about this place is that all types of people like to eat here and not just one specific audience who likes to eat sustainably. i also think townhall is very affordable so it draws a lot of people in. one of my favorite dishes is the bangkok bowl with tiger shrimps, veggies, noodles, and spicy fish broth. it is truly delicious. their burgers are all grass fed and come with these great truffle fries that are addicting. if you like organic, non gmo, sustainable food you have to try townhall"}
{"text":"Loved the food here! Great atmosphere and wonderful selection of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free food which is hard to find."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great food and great staff.  They have a really good beer always on called True Brit, one of the better beer selections in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Solid beer rotating beer selection that is reasonably priced. 
Crowd varies between 21 to 40's and has different vibes at different times of the day. 
Food is awesome but doesn't seem to change a whole lot. Brunch is also one of the more popular ones in town."}
{"text":"I give this five stars for three reasons. 1)Their belief that GMO food is not healthy. It isn't! 2)Their willingness to offer fresh creative gluten free options, not just the average meat and lettuce gluten free options at most restaurants. 3) The food is great!

Me wife and I had as an appetizer the Prosciutto Wrapped Dates. These are like candy! For entrees we had the food truck tacos and the Grilled Cheese Bars and Soup. I added bacon to the sandwich and had the tomato bisque soup. The grilled cheese and tomato bisque were great for a crisp fall evening. My wife enjoyed the gluten free tortillas on the tacos.

They also have a great expansive collection of beers on tap. The handles are always changing you can be adventurous and try different beers. I had Southern Tier: Warlock an imperial stout laced with pumpkin spice, coffee, and chocolate. Very tasty!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super long wait, okay food. Very trendy and into the whole \"non-GMO\" schtick. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Cleveland and popped in for drink and food because it was near our hotel. Very good beer and interesting menu selection such as korean BBQ pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best places to eat in Cleveland!! The atmosphere is so laid back and cozy especially on the patio with the fire towers. The food is unreal delicious. Have vegan, paleo, gluten free and this is one of the few restaurants I've been to based off this concept. Order the smashed avocado to start, it was to die for. We will be back as regulars."}
{"text":"i love how this place looks. the use of wood for the bar is really cool. the patio will be nice to hang out on when it gets warmer. it does get exceptionally busy and crowded though so i stick to going on weekdays.

however, man, they really gotta up their game on the vegan stuff. i pretty much only go here on monday nights, firstly for the beers $3 all drafts, and secondly for the vegan/vegetarian night. every time i go, i have high hopes for the food. i have had a number of things on the menu but they've all been let down. first of all, anything asian can basically be done better at an actual asian restaurant. i just had the vegan sliders on the new monday vegan menu. those were probably the best of what i've gotten, but still a little bland. their grilled cheese was good. maybe it's just a vegan thing. i normally am vegetarian not vegan so i don't have much to compare.

now don't get me wrong. i will still be back here on mondays for the beer. but i think i have to adjust my expectations on the food."}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps Townhall from a 5 star review is its service.  Except when you eat at the bar, the servers do not often make themselves available.  The food is really good, and imaginative.  You can go there as a meat eater or as a vegan and have plenty to choose from.  The coffee drinks at Townhall are amazing.  They truly make the best almond milk latte that I have ever had."}
{"text":"2 stars reflects that this is not the absolute worst place I've ever been. It is definitely the worst I've seen in Ohio City, though.

I ordered a beer. You order by number like you're at McDonald's. Despite that, I received the obviously wrong beer (wrong color, wrong smell, etc.) and took it back. The girl running the register asked me if I was sure (loss of one point for customer service) and then told me that she didn't know much about beer so she would have to ask the bartender. Sure enough, it was wrong and the beer was replaced. Not a great start.

I ordered the Bar Mix thinking that it would be brought to the table ahead of the main course. Nope. Don't know what the point of bringing Chex Mix after 15 minutes is but that's how they roll.

I got the Thai Bowl. I'm OK with replacing noodles with rice as part of culinary experimentation but there was no flavor. The rice was soggy and there was no heat.

My wife got the tacos. 3 tacos with 3 wildly varying amounts of content. It was like Goldilocks.

My friend got the burger which came with a salad. The salad apparently doesn't come with any kind of dressing. The waitress seemed like it was a hassle to make that special exception.

I was told that the burger was good so I guess they got part of one meal right. Other than that, this wasn't just a simple case of a basic mistake or two. This was poor customer service, poor kitchen execution and poor bar execution. There was not one part of this experience that I think they nailed and could build upon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service - the fries, sandwiches and beer selection were great, and the architecture is fantastic"}
{"text":"I love this place. Today's lunch was kinda a mess with service, but I'm not taking that out on my rating cause this is the first time I've had issues here and everyone deserves an off day. 

FRESH, FUN, UNIQUE FOOD. Menu is overwhelming to this simple gal. It's a little too funky of options for my tastes but they have tacos, a burger, and flatbreads which is always a go to option when I'm overwhelmed or if you're like me and not a health food connoisseur. I ordered a fresh veggie/fruit smoothie today for the first time which was ridiculously delicious. The others food looked and tasted delicious, gonna try the harvest salad next time! 

Atmosphere: hands down one of the coolest places in Cleveland. The decor is so detailed and unique and the open air feel is so enjoyable with good weather. Love the relaxing patio, feels like every time you are at townhall you are just at a big fancy backyard party that everyone's invited to. 

Always a place we frequent when in the area. If you haven't been here, go."}
{"text":"As some other posters said, the vibe here is kind of strange. They're going for the healthy, Non-GMO thing, which is cool. The restaurant also has a young and hip vibe with its decor and service staff. The part that really caught me off guard was the weird TGI Friday's balloons hats/kids running around. I'm all for kids coming to eat with their families, but the scene was confusing. I went for a girls brunch and was offered a balloon hat. Weird. 

On the other hand, I did really enjoy my food. The avocado toast was out of this world. I have no clue how avocado toast can be that good, but wow."}
{"text":"I'm a Lyft driver and Townhall is my most popular destination.  I took my wife there and we were greeted by a very friendly hostess.  Short wait, and great system of texting, and we were seated.  

Had the burger and wife tacos.  We both loved our dinners and the service was excellent!  

Huge place with a ton of people but it's really neat in there.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Don't understand stand why people like this place.  I've been here many time (not my pick of the night) a lot of people and a lot of younger people that I would say are under age for a place like that.  I've been there in the middle of the day for lunch food was good but they offer a juice bar and we payed for it and come to find out the only machine working was the water.  So I payed $6 for water and they wouldn't refund me"}
{"text":"Came for brunch.  I have southern roots, and the \"Southern Comfort\" breakfast turned my world upside down!  Seriously the BEST biscuits and gravy I've ever had!  And as always, great service and not too long of a wait.  Our server was Julie, she was a sweetheart!  Thanks for the yum!!"}
{"text":"Had such a great experience when I decided to give this place a shot out of the blue. Have never really been into the craft beer thing, but our server, Jessica N, was helpful and put thought into helping us find a brew that we would enjoy (she succeeded). Looking forward to coming in during burger night sometime."}
{"text":"When making the commute to work in CLE, this place was awesome.  Great time hanging during the 16 nba playoffs with great fans and good food.  Fun happy hour with people coming out, staff friendly and willing to make the experience worthwhile to drive out (kind of middle of nowhere compared to downtown, maybe ignorance as a visitor).  

Food was legit.  Had the curry noodles and it was way too filling and so flavorful.  The burgers looked so good we went weekly on mondays!"}
{"text":"I'm usually very liberal about giving out 5 star or 4 star reviews but I'm giving this 2 relative to the high reviews this has. Let me preface by saying the service and staff are really great and attentive even during this crowded day we were there. I had some sort of green tea infused gin cocktail that was a highlight but 10 dollars a pop was steep. 

I had the smashed avocado which I guess was meant to be akin to guacamole but it felt like guacamole not blended up enough and the chips to avocado ratio was way too highly skewed toward chips. I then had some sort of tofu taco thing which was fine but nothing to write home about. My lunchmate had a curry noodle type dish, good but mediocre.

Great service, well managed logistics with a crowd but was surprised by the food not reaching par with a heavily reviewed 4 star establishment."}
{"text":"Tried it two more times.  Take out nachos - stupid.  Shouldn't have done that.  But that was our fault.

Last night I had a curry bowl and it was spicy (as in over seasoned). But it was just bad.  I sent it back and got tabbouli which had cauliflower in it.  Just. Don't.

I want to love this place but it seems like they are good at meat dishes but fall apart as soon as you throw the vegan tag on it.  Fine if you can't make vegan food, but take it off the menu.

They would like me to try again - I will revise my review when I give it another go."}
{"text":"TH is a big time establishment, good food and drinks by day and beautiful people by night. If you're looking for some fine chicks this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I like that they have gluten free foods, even if the gf breads aren't that good (it's the old-style gf breads that fall apart and have little substance).  I usually just don't bother ordering burgers without the bun instead of paying extra for the poor-quality gf bun.  And I do like that they have paleo menu options even if it's no better than what I make at home.  The paleo food seems more like something done to check off a list of what they have versus offering something really good and worth the visit.  With that said, the food isn't bad.  I don't think it's amazing, but it's not bad for the price point.  I would actually give the food 3 on its own. 

Even so I wish my friends wouldn't insist on coming back to this joint since we never get good service.  The bar service is slow even when it's not crowded and they still have three to four people behind the bar.  Servers often times don't know the menu.  I've even had multiple occasions where one member of the group doesn't get their food until after everyone else's food was delivered and eaten.  My favorite time was when we ordered a meal and a to-go desert.  The desert came first, not in a to-go box, and she forgot to put in the meal order.  Service is really inept.  There's a few good servers there and a lot of people who have no clue what they are doing."}
{"text":"First time here. Great place. Great vibe. Great food. The kids menu kit comes with crayons and bendable, twistable \"wikki stix\". And they even gave each of the kids a balloon. Nice touch! No GMOs in their menu! Got the lamb burger. Well-seasoned, well-cooked. My only complaint was that it was too heavy on the tzatziki sauce. Fries were awesome!!! I usually ask for a side of ranch with my fries, but these fries are better as is. Our server, Amanda, was super sweet and friendly. As first-timers, she was very helpful with the menu and she never came by our table without a smile . A lot of great looking stuff on their menu, so we'll definitely be back to try more of the fare."}
{"text":"4pm on a Wednesday my fiance and I found ourselves wanting a late lunch/early dinner.  This was the first time I've seen TH not packed to the gills so we sat at the bar and were quickly waited on.

I wanted something light so I got the Poke bowl, which we all argued about the pronunciation of.  I thought it was [poka], the bartender said [pok], and my fiance said it was [pokie].  I'll be looking that up after this review.

Long story slightly shorter my meal was great, but I was left feeling a little hungry.  Luckily my fiance has no concept of how rude it is to never finish her meals , so got to eat most her cheeseburger and truffle fries.

I guess she's never heard of all the starving kids in Africa.

Btw the truffle fries were phenomenal.  5/5 aka the Gary Rall Gold Star."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Cleveland. All of the food and drinks are SO amazing! And the Bone Broth I could drink gallons of! And the raw juices are delectable! They have lots of clean healthy options which are all delicious! The staff is friendly and give great service! I come here everyday sometimes twice a day when I'm in town! Yumtown!"}

{"text":"As a former employee that made the non- organic juice which is advertised as organic at TH,
I would like to share a few interesting facts with you ;

Only approximately 10 percent of the fruits and veggies are organic,

The vegetables are not being washed before blending and pressing.
 
Bottles that you are drinking out of may have been re used a dozen times after being run through a 60 second dishwasher cycle which may or may not have detergent in it. Keep in mind that bottle housed non pasteurized  juice before yours.As per the cost efficiency guy, 
Saves 30 cents.

As of recently water is being added to each finished batch before bottling without change to the ingredients on the menu.

Example:
    Citrus could be as much as 20-25  percent added water on an 8 oz bottle.

* Just be aware of what you are buying and ask questions 

If you make a conscious decision then no harm, If you are expecting organic in a new bottle, Don't be misled."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good...the drink list is actually solid (but it should be with the increasing amount of bars/breweries popping up).  the service sucks...its almost downright disrespectful.  the way the servers talk amongst themselves and treat patrons is beyond belief.  also, i tend to feel that unless youre muscular or wearing a suit from working downtown, this place doesnt cater to you.  its incredibly loud, and every time ive been here ive felt like its overcrowded for the space it has.  id recommend abc tavern & bier markt over this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"This place may very well be my own personal version of hell.  And I can't quite even pinpoint what it is that just rubs me the wrong way.

Well first of all, you walk in (for lunch) and what the hell is going on?  One half of the place is waiter service.  One half is order at the counter.  They both have the same menu.  And it was apparently brunch time complete with a very random crepe station set up in the middle of everything on a fold out table.

Basically, the entire thing is a whole new level in hipster concept restaurants...the like of which I have never witnessed in the state of Ohio before.  I have no doubt there are worse affronts to humanity on the coasts, but we are talking Cleveland here.

So the first sign seemed to be the weird ordering concept.  But it was quickly underlined by our choice of....water.  Self-serve carbonated water OR filtered OR osmosis filtered.  3 different kinds of water.  Are you $*@)(*#% me?

But this place can still redeem itself with food...right?  I had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque.  I wasn't feeling too crazy.  The grilled cheese was fine, though they could have spiffed it up a bit for the price.  The bisque was just BAD.  That's right, they screwed up tomato bisque.  Apparently, it had blue cheese mixed in (and not mentioned on the menu).  I'm not a huge fan but it can lend a great flavor in moderation.  It was not in moderation.  It was overpowering. Thinking it was just me, everyone else at the table tasted it and found it inedible.

For my dad and my husband, they had food.  It was edible.  No one seemed to have anything super positive to say.  And my mom had the biscuits and gravy.  Simple right?  You can't screw that up...right?  Well they did and they committed, perhaps, the biggest affront to the dish of biscuits and gravy that anyone can make.  There wasn't enough gravy.  It wasn't a huge portion (a common thread in this slightly overpriced food) but she was left with biscuit...with no gravy.  It could have been the best damn gravy in the world, but what's the point if you are left with dry biscuit?????

So uh yeah, they earn a star because the food was edible.  And because I was really thirsty and I did enjoy that ridiculous pop machine that made like 200 different flavors of pop...until it broke down in the middle of our visit.  Seems like they have a very decent beer list, but there's only about 20 other trendy bars in the same area and, of course, the mecca of beer, Great Lakes Brewing Company, so it's pretty hard to care about this.

In conclusion, one could label me a hipster.  I tend to listen to hipster-y music, went to a hipster college, and generally like hipster restaurants and bars...I'm shameless about it.  But this, this is a whole new level of hipster hell and it scares me.  Is it a sit-down restaurant?  Trendy water bar? Sports bar?  We may never be able to truly say...and I don't care to dig any deeper into such serious philosophical debates."}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews of this place, decided to check it out. Great atmosphere!!!  Wood bar and exposed brick make it a fun spot. A lot of attention to detail. love the lighting!! We didn't order food but the menu looks great! Lots of beer selections and I was intrigued by cigar selections (pretty creative). Bartender was friendly and knowledgable. Had a great time hanging out watching Indians game. Will definitely come back to check out food!"}
{"text":"This place is huge, compared to most Cleveland restaurants. We had several servers as we had to wait a long time for a table, but the weather was beautiful so it was nice to enjoy a drink outside before being seated. Both Sean's are great at their jobs. We also had an Alice or Alex as our food server (I couldn't quite hear her name). She was a total sweetheart and very helpful as well. The hostess was a witch so they lost half a star for that but the wait staff all seemed really friendly. My boyfriend and I split two plates. Both were good but not phenomenal. He got the PB rice and I got the food truck tacos. I liked them both for the first few bites but was glad I had someone to switch with later. Another half star off for that but all my friends LOVED their food so I may just be extra picky. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend, though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch, brunch, dinner, or even for some leisurely drinks. There are a few must haves on the list of foods. First, the veggie burger. I've had a lot of veggie burgers in my life because I'm not big on red meat, and I have to say their Townhall burger by far is number one. It's made with beats so it is full of moisture and flavor. I always ask for an extra side of the rosemary aioli (literally ranch on steroids, and they need to start selling jars of this sauce) because it is outstanding. Second is the Ohio City salad(add the chicken!). Dates, goat cheese, avocado, onions, almonds, and a champagne vinaigrette? ... the combination is outstanding. Third would have to be the Thai bowl. I always tend to get tofu and chicken in mine because the chicken is extremely moist and the tofu is some of the best cooked tofu I've ever had. Not to mention the sauce is outstanding. If you like a little spice might I recommend asking your server for some siracha(the best hot sauce in the world). Finally (even though I could talk highly about all of their dishes) would have to be the steak if you go for dinner. It literally melts in your mouth. They drizzle a balsamic reduction over the entire plate bringing the arugula salad, the potatoes, and the steak into one amazing dish. Honestly, if you enjoy flavorful healthy food, I highly suggest visiting Townhall. Every dish has something amazing to offer. 

I do have to mention their brunch as well. The OHC benedict is outstanding, especially if you add the sausage. I always try a savory crepe as well from the crepe bar with some siracha too. They serve brunch on Saturdays and sundays unlike everywhere else who only serves on sundays. 

Now for the alcohol.. The variety that Townhall offers is incredible, which is probably what makes them so popular. Not only do they have 33 craft brews on tap that change every time I come in, they also provide bottled varieties as well. They carry close to 8 bottled beers from one of my favorite breweries, Great Divide (try the oatmeal yeti). I'm not a big whiskey/bourbon fan, but they provide over 60 different kinds. I was amazed to find out that their well whiskey was jack Daniels, and reasonably priced as well. They just came out with a bunch of fall cocktails that are phenomenal and if you haven't had the emulsions I suggest you try them(indigo!).

All in all, Townhall is a great place to go for any occasion."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with another couple about 3 weeks ago.  One of our friends is gluten-free so it is always a challenge finding places that really know what that means and can accommodate so that he is not sick later.  Townhall had a plentiful number of gf options specifically listed on their menu, so we thought it would be a good place to try.

Our experience was ok.  It was a gorgeous night, so we waited for our table outside.  Once we were seated, it was VERY loud and we couldn't even really talk to the people at our table.

Our waiter could have checked on our table a few more times, water glasses needed to be refilled but weren't.

The food was ok.  I got the farmhouse flatbread, my husband got a burger and both were ok, but not enough to make me need to go back.  The other couple we were with got the basil fried rice and a gluten free steak sandwich.  They said the basil fried rice was VERY dry and could have used some sauce on the side to help break it up.  The gluten free steak sandwich got ok reviews, but he said you could definitely tell the bun was gf.

Overall, it was an ok experience, I probably wouldn't select it myself to go back, but wouldn't hesitate about going with a group if it was chosen by the group.  The menu had MANY options so there would likely be something for everyone."}
{"text":"You know those signs?  \"If it's too loud, you're too old.\"

Discovered this morning at Townhall I'm too old.

\"Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation.\"

{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a good brunch spot on saturday and saw that this spot had a good reputation. Parking sucked its meters all around, but it's hard to find a good spot that's close. Parking is probably the only issue I found with this place.

It's a great environment, everyone there is having a fun time just by the looks on their faces. The waitress was great, since it was my first time she gave me some good info on a couple menu items. I ordered the Southern Comfort, big fan of biscuits and gravy for brunch. The order came out warm, fluffy biscuits with a poached egg and savory sausage gravy. Price was reasonable for the amount of food I got, and I left full. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"Go-to restaurant in Cleveland! Love the Thai peanut bowl but everything on the menu is great and healthy. Fun place to be."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go too. I am not vegan or vegetarian. I love trying new food and flavors. They have wonderful ambience and food. The service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, quick seating for a Saturday night. I had the best burger of my life. Not greasy at all and didn't need condiments however I got a side of mustard and it was scorching hot. Service was wonderful and the food arrived quickly. Prices were fair. I'd love to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I am way too low-key for a place like Townhall. This is the Cleveland that I typically avoid - loud, over-the-top, fashion-forward, high energy - it's pretty much everything I'm not. I'm the guy that wants quiet in my bars and restaurants. I'm the guy that doesn't wanna feel like I've gotta try so hard to fit in. And I'm the guy that likes to have a conversation with my wife while we're eating. 

Admittedly, choosing the same night as the Townhall first anniversary party for my first visit may not have been the best idea, but Willoughby Brewing Company brewed a special beer for the event that I really wanted to try so, there you have it. Also keep this in mind as you read this review as my experience may be atypical.

We arrived sometime around 6pm and it was already packed (see above). We were immediately greeted and led to a table along the back wall. As others have mentioned Townhall is actually two distinct personalities. There's the cafe, your more traditional sit-down bar/eatery, and there's the tavern, which is, well, a tavern. We were in the cafe side. The decor is great. I love the wood and brick and natural materials throughout. The banquette was mighty comfy on the ass as well. The bar is long, stretching nearly the entire length of the place and the outside space is fairly large, too. All in all, the layout is comfortable, well-lit and spacious.

This was my first visit so I don't know if this is normal, but ho-ly shit, was it loud. Top 40 dance music pulsing, bass thumping, it was pretty crazy. I couldn't have a conversation with my wife at our table without yelling, really. At one point I actually considered just texting her because I got so damn sick of repeating myself two or three times every time I opened my mouth. Maybe it's more low-key during the week/day, but this was something that would keep me away.

The service we had was pretty good. On the good side we were immediately served waters (without having to ask for them) and our first drink orders were brought within a couple of minutes. Our server also kept them filled and checked in throughout our meal. On the not-so-good, the pace of the meal was frenetic. We ordered and it was BOOM salads BOOM entrees BOOM check. I felt pretty rushed during our meal and the massive crowds and noise just added to my anxiety. 

I won't go into too much detail about the beer as just about everyone else has already covered it. Their craft beer selection is killer, 40 draught lines (not enough Ohio craft beer love). I also like their flat-rate beer pricing. Every beer is $5. Not bad for their 14oz pours but a tad steep for the 8oz-ers ($10 pints?). I don't know how they determine the cutoff between the sizes (probably ABV%) but pour sizes aren't provided on the beer menu.

The food was pretty good as well. Nothing to write home about, but solid. 

Unfortunately, the general theme with the food was \"unseasoned\". A kitchen that's afraid of salt, apparently. The burger was OK. It was cooked well-done (we weren't asked how we wanted it) and came served with their truffled shoestring fries. The meat had a nice flavor but was bland. I'm also not a fan of truffle fries as they typically have a chemical/artificial flavor to them from the \"truffle\" oil. My feeling, unless you're gonna use real truffles, don't bother.

The Kobe steak torta, ugh. A bit of a disaster. A roll sparsely populated by tiny bits of chewy, overcooked beef. The \"caramelized\" onions were barely cooked and the liquid from the pico had turned the bun into mush. I don't know why I continue to order steak sandwiches, places never get them right.. I ate the meat and left the rest.

Good salads, too. We had both the OHC salad and the Brite Citrus salad. Fresh ingredients, tasty dressings and they were sized appropriately meaning I didn't feel like I'd been violated (too much) for ordering a $9 salad. Not a fan of dried dates, though. Gotta remember that.

They make a fine five dollar milkshake, though. Mitchell's ice cream, organic milk. Like a high-class Frosty.

Townhall isn't my thing. I'm not nearly trendy enough or extroverted enough or, whatever enough to make it a regular addition to my Ohio City schedule. Too bad, really, cause their beer selection is damn impressive and does offer some unique beers not found in the other OHC bars. Oh well, guess I'll just stick to places where old introverts hang out."}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly during the Ohio City Street Festival! My toddler was getting hangry, and I wanted to cool off from the sun! 

Wait time wasn't bad when I arrived. Maybe 20 minutes or so, and the business texts you when your table is ready! Our waitress, whose name I wish I could remember, was phenomenal and went above and beyond to give us an exceptional experience. 

Great draft beer list, I personally recommend #32, and an amazing wine selection! Indoor and outdoor seating, and your water always stays full. I ordered the chicken nachos, WHICH WERE BOMB AF, and my son had a burger and some really, really good fries. The whole menu made me want to binge eat my feelings, but I contained myself because I was wearing real pants instead of my usual go-to of leggings. 

I can't wait to come back here and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because it has been a while. Although I haven't really tried much of the food, most of my friends rave about the food here. I guess they have a really good Paleo menu. They have a lot of healthy foods. So I take back what I said about not eating here. Definitely eat away."}
{"text":"Townhall is by far my most favorite bar in Cleveland. As a local, I come here quite often. If it's not for drinks, I definitely come for the food. The grass fed burger is amazing and like no other burger that you would have ate before! The atmosphere is welcoming and it's a fun place to come to on the weekends or when there is a game on! Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Considering this place is run by a \"restaurant group\", one would think they would know how to open a restaurant. Not the case here. Service is laughably bad and completely inept. It seems that none of these people have ever worked in the industry before and were hired solely by their attractiveness, which is on par for the owner of Barley House. The clientele it's bringing in to the neighborhood makes me want to puke, again, refer to BH. I don't care that it just opened, if you hire professionals and know what you're doing, it really shouldn't matter. Plenty of places have killed it during their opening week. The concept is stupid and makes no sense. I cannot wait until the hype surrounding this place dies. Please take your guido chains and Ferraris back to whatever ring of hell you came from. This place is the bane of Ohio City's current existence. Think Moda 2. Hopefully it swiftly meets the same fate.

PS: If you love the \"atmosphere\" after 9 pm, YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM."}
{"text":"They do a great job marketing this place.  The food is trendy, offering vegan mondays, poke bowls, etc.  It's quite pricey but the quality of the ingredients is good.  They pride themselves in being GMO if that matters to you.  What I love the most is that they have games to play, like Connect 4, Jenga, etc, so it's a great place to hang out when it's not crazy busy.  One can come with kids during the day and play games while having something yummy, or at night without kids and play after a few beers from their great selection =).  They hold events, health-related lectures, etc there as well.  On days the Indians play at home, they also offer a shuttle service to the game.  I hear brunch is also great there, notably the crepes, though I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side, but hands down my favorite organic non gmo restaurant in Ohio city ! You need to get the flying circus !!! Such a yummy drink !!"}
{"text":"Really large menu that caters to every dietary need and preference. Vegan? Pales? Gluten free? No problem and clearly marked. On Monday evenings they offer a vegan menu in addition to the normal menu, and on Wednesdays a paleo menu. So far we've tried the crispy chicken sandwich, fries, cauliflower appetizer, and the zoodles wth shrimp. The zoodles were not what I expected from the menu description but delicious. From the vegan menu we adored the pepita dip--- order it! I also tried the general Taos tofu bowl which I found overly sweet and didn't care for. The sweet potosi skins are also delicious and make for a good entree."}
{"text":"This is a great place to catch up with friends (on the quieter dining side) or to meet new people. This place is packed on the weekends and even more so on days when its not raining or snowing. The greatest thing here is the fabulous patio seating out back. Generous lounge seating with nicely landscaped walls. Inside, you'll find that this place has a nice chic and industrial look. Wood paneling on walls and ceilings with cement counter tops and up-cycled furniture. The dining side has a garage door that opens up to let in fresh air and give a clearer view onto W 25th. Definitely a nice place to take out of towners who enjoy beer and like a bit more company.

There's usually a very good collection of beers from throughout the country. The menu changes daily and features 30+ beers on tap. All are $5 (some are 8 oz pours for the stronger brews). There are a few brews that stay on the daily list like the Willoughby PB coffee stout. I honestly can't say which is my favorite here as I like to try something new each time. I'm a fan of IPAs and there's usually quite a few on the list that's new to me. 

I haven't been here for a meal but I heard their food is quite good. I'm guessing its similar in quality to Market Garden. I do love their truffle fries though! Thin crispy cuts, lightly salted with a dash of truffle oil. My GF craves for this every time we're in OC."}
{"text":"I know place trying to be hip,I know it is fool of hip people, I know people who work there trying to be hip but some of them sucks as a servers !!!! Menu looking very interesting ,good concept but it is NOT executed right !!!! Our food took 25 minutes for appetizers ,and they come out cold and greasy,  sitting in \"the window\" to long, main course took another 40 minutes ,again sitting in \"the window\" to long!!!! Server nor friendly ,fake, not interested with helping guests with food problems ,just another robot in the machine ! But who I am to judge !!!!??? I just have 30 years of F&B experience including Culinary Arts , working as a chef , waiter, bartender, food runner , food rider ,author etc. etc. etc. !!!! Sorry for my bad comments ,but I just want to be fare and I will tell you to I am easy spirited man and I am HIP to ,but I don't like bad food wrapped in golden paper for my hard earned money !!!!

{"text":"Amazing food, brunch was fantastic.  I love that they are farm to table and that they offer many vegan/vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I am so torn on how to rate Townhall, mostly because its night scene is totally different from its during the day crowd. So I think I will give it a solid 3 stars and then review it like it's two separate businesses:

Review One, The restaurant during the day: 3/5 stars
I have eaten here a couple of times now and I don't really have any complaints, but I don't really have any rave reviews either. I've gotten a couple of different things off the menu (chicken tacos, chili, edamame, pizza, etc.) all of which were good, but not great. I was mostly disappointed by the tacos, only because I feel like its hard to not have a super flavorful taco and yet somehow their's lack serious taste. Also, the chili is almost unbearably hot. It taste good, but damn you need like a gallon of milk to finish it all.

The beer selection is pretty great though, never had any complaints there.

Review Two: The bar at night: 2/5
Do you like pushing through hot sweaty swarms of tools and overly primped girls in too high of heels? Do you like your guys in shirts two sizes to small, overly tanned, and in skin-tight bedazzled jeans? Do you prefer waiting a minimum of 45 minutes for a drink, only to get it knocked out of your hand the second you try to brave the crowd? If you said yes to anything, then Townhall is your kind of place! 

long story short: it sucks."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in the Cleveland area. I took my husband here for Father's Day and he loved everything.  He had the prosciutto and poached egg over bruschetta and he raved about it.  I had the burrito and it was tasty, the hot sauce they brought when I asked kicked it up a notch. :)

Plus the healthful smoothies we both had were delicious.  What I love most is that all the food is organic and most are locally-sourced. And for Father's Day brunch, they had a crepe=making station!!  :0  What's not to love?

The highlight of this place is the outdoor space.  It's a beautifully-designed place with both tables and low red leather benches.  And the parked rickshaw makes for a great photo-op.  

All in all, I think this a great new restaurant (only two weeks old!) that has already found its swing.  I imagine a nice outdoor birthday party in October and November with the outdoor space all lit up."}
{"text":"They still don't know how to make cocktails, so let's look past that. I was here recently on a Sunday and let's just say they were packed to the gills. We were seated swiftly given the rush and the service was top notch. I mean honestly I would have thought it would be subpar just because of how busy they are but boy did they deliver. I wish I remembered the names of the two gals so I could thank them again but honestly I was blown by how efficient cordial and detail oriented they were. The food has always been stellar and there are no complaints there, they always have healthy options plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so that is always a plus. Overall excellent place to eat at, great for groups and yes it will be crowded and noisy but if you were here for a quiet dinner for two then let's just say you'd prolly leave madder than a wet hen!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Townhall is amazing. The food at Townhall is even better, whether it's brunch, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Cool place that is broken into a restaurant section and a bar section.  I am going to talk about the bar section.  There are a lot of good beers on tap with a wide variety of styles.  The bartenders knew what they were talking about and were able to give recommendations.  There is also a big outside area but this was closed when I was there since it was wintertime."}
{"text":"Great food, and healthy. I've tried a lot of their flatbreads and live them all. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great place to have a great meal and awesome brews! I've eaten there several times and have yet to have a bad meal. great service and attention, Danny Inks has that down to the Tee! town hall is one place you should definitely check out. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my food here. They have a great beer and cocktail selection. The staff is friendly and nice. It's not my favorite at night as it gets extremely busy. Overall reat dinner or lunch spot. There is street parking but its normally full. There is a cheap paid lot right behind. The patio is super nice. Love the interior decor."}
{"text":"My favorite place in OHC by far! This place has something for everyone especially their Crowlers. It's a canning system which you can take one of their 36 craft draft beers home with you OR their nitrogen toddy. That's right nitrogen infused toddy which is absolutely delicious when looking for a coffee fix. Brunch is offered on Saturday and Sunday which stands out from the rest. Enjoy lunch on their huge patio or grab a juice on the go! Either way you won't ever be disappointed when visiting Townhall."}
{"text":"Best gluten free menu selection in town!"}
{"text":"This is a really great find for dinner or an afternoon drink. It is a very unique restaurant in The Cleveland area. There is nothing like it that I know of. I love the goat cheese and kale flatbread and goat cheese dates. They have organic rose which I'm obsessed with. However, this is my least favorite spot to drink at once 9:30pm rolls around. Once the night crew rolls in, its loud and you can't talk to anyone."}
{"text":"I visited Townhall for the first time last night after hearing how great it was. I will start off by saying that the inside was very impressive! Loved the lighting, tables and booth wall. I loved how it opens. I bet it will be great in warmer weather. So the inside is 4Star!

We were seated by a very nice hostess who looked over to a server and asked if it was ok for us to sit in her section. We sat for 6 minutes without even being acknowledged. Our server was chatting at a table and didn't even bother to say she will be right with us. HUGE pet peeve. As a former waitress I was at least expecting her to stop chit chatting and get a drink order. (Mind you, the place had more empty tables than full) Then she finally came by to say she would be right with us. When she finally came back I ordered Ginger Ale and she asked if I would like the homemade or regular. I asked her to explain the homemade and she finished with saying 'you probably won't like it' Kinda rude. I ordered it.

The homemade Ginger Ale was AMAZING! Best I have ever had! I also had the Basil Fried Rice! So YUMMY

I totally rate the food at 5 Stars. Service 2 Stars. I will go back hoping next time to not be ignored. I want to experience it open aired!"}
{"text":"Townhall is one of my favorite spots in Cle! Whether you stop in for brunch, lunch, dinner or late night for drinks there is something for everyone here! Townhall is also a great place to catch a game or catch up with friends. On the weekends it's fun to grab dinner and then stick around for the party. It's the place to be seen in CLE and is always a great time with great music. 

The menu has a wide variety of options which are made fresh. I have tried many different menu items. The burger is literally one of the best I've had; perfectly cooked with fresh toppings and sauces and the bun is perfectly toasted.  The bowls are all very flavorful- my fav being the Spaghetti Squash Bolognese. The grilled cheese bars and soup is another favorite. I honestly CRAVE the skillet cookie- who doesn't love a warm chocolatey fresh cookie topped with Mitchell's ice cream?!! It's a huge serving that I'm not even ashamed to admit Ive inhaled this whole thing on my own more than once. And on that note Townhall also has a nice variety of salads with tons of healthy ingredients to balance out all the calories consumed from that skillet cookie. 

Staff is friendly and welcoming. Townhall is always packed and it is well deserved. It is a \"must stop\" in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this was such a disappointing experience. We expected the wait, being brunch time on a Saturday, but what was a shocking 40 minute wait became an hour without much effort. Because we waited until 2--when brunch ends--we were promptly informed (only after being seated) that their kitchen would be closed for the next 30 minutes with the exception of 3 appetizers.
Having the extra time to scope out the scene, it's incredibly ridiculous. Menu items include \"reverse osmosis still water, bone broth smoothies, and alcoholic milkshakes.\"  The entire concept caters to a walking stereotype. They preach no GMOs and Center their virtue around the inherent evil of \"shoddy science.\" 
It just goes too far for me to see it as a viable option."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Ohio City! TownHall has great selections for vegan/vegetarian fares as well as those who are gluten free. 

Make sure to come early on the weekends for the BYO crepes that they have during brunch (9am - 2pm) on Sat & Sun."}
{"text":"Townhall offers something for everyone. Burgers, pizzas, creative and delicious salads, veggie burgers, acai bowl sweetness, milkshakes, fresh juices, smoothies, beer, wine and cocktails. The service is friendly and attentive, and management is always around if you want to share your feedback about any part of your experience. Townhall often offers pop-up shops, wellness talks, arts & crafts activities and other fun events to engage the community in all that they offer. Go here!"}
{"text":"Great meal and atmosphere. Sat at the bar. Chipotle sweet potato skins were awesome. Had the strip steak. Steak was perfect and the sides made the meal even better. Large chunk of grilled pineapple along with fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Came back to Cleveland to visit family & friends, was suggested this fine establishment to come eat late after hours & was blown away by the quality of the food & ingredients. This place reminds me of my neighborhood back in SF in the Mission. Looking forward to coming back again & again on every visit"}
{"text":"AWFUL! Called Saturday to check on getting  Sunday reservations. Don't take reservations...that's fine. Called again Sunday to to tell them that we were bringing an 11 year old for his birthday (he specifically requested Townhall) to make sure they'd do a special dessert for him. They said see you at 5pm on Sunday. We all arrive at 5 to find out Townhall was closed at 5 for company party. How could 2 phone calls be placed (day before and day of) and absolutely NO mention of the closing. Disappointed doesn't cover this. What a terrible way to run a business!"}
{"text":"Excellent! 
We came here for lunch and there was a 15min wait. The hostess was very friendly and the restaurant texted us (instead of yelling our name or having a buzzer) when the table was ready. We sat outside on the patio and it was lovely. Extensive beer list and excellent menu options for vegetarians/vegans. Highly recommend Townhall for a low-key, easy going atmosphere, great beer & food."}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks but never food until this past weekend and I was very pleased! I will definitely return to try more of the menu! This trip I had the chicken tacos..because I LOVE tacos! They were good, though the chicken was just a tad dry/bland. But with the guac (really good) and the salsa it cured that problem! The nachos and salsa on the side are also good! My friend had one of the burgers, which one escapes me right now, and it looked SO good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We love townhall! Their brunch is always amazing-The sweet potato pancakes are so delicious the crepes are phenomenal, egg dishes and lunch items are always spot on. Love coming here and almond milk lattes-this place had me with just those!!"}
{"text":"The menu & drinks : eclectic.  Which is nice. Decor is nice too. This place is packed on the weekend. Their brewed green tea & indigo (ketel citron, blueberries,simple,lemon) was tasty!  The bibb lettuce wraps are AMAZING! So is the kobe beef torta. . The chicken milanese was a good portion. Chicken was cooked nicely. I liked it, but I guess from the description I envisioned something more. The service was good. The bathroom could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"Finally, a place with mostly gluten free and organic food choices.....and it tastes amazing. Looking for healthy eats and awesome beer choices....you won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Can someone tell me WHY this is place so popular? It's probably one of the most contrived places in Cleveland, one of the least contrived cities in the country. There are no local beers on tap, the drinks are no better then what you could have a bartender make for you at Chili's, and the food is JUST mediocre. I think this place is the official meeting ground for the douchebags of Cleveland. So, make sure to pop your collar when you arrive. 

Instead of going here, try some legitimately great other places in Ohio City including, but not limited to: Market Garden, The Black Pig, the Flying Fig, or the Harp.

This place will not give you an adequate representation of Cleveland's genuine awesomeness."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have eaten. The GMO free is unnecessary but the food is excellent! There are plenty of menu options and room for customization. And, despite how busy it can get, the service was quick. The atmosphere and decor were extremely cool. I'll definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"We had heard SUCH good things about this place and it has been on my Cleveland to-do list for awhile.

My boyfriend and I went up for the Night Market (specifically for the Most Delicious Cookie Company) and stayed over night and hit this place up for brunch the next day.

we had to wait about 45 minutes so we walked abound the market nearby to kill time.

When we finally got seated, the menu looked really good, they have a create your own crepe station going on which is super cool, but i don't know why you have to get up from your table to go to the station and not just give your order to the server.  Seemed like a pain in the butt so neither of us did it.

i got the tacos with the beyond meat chicken in them - disregarding the meat substitute which i had never had before the flavor was just meh...

I can't remember what my boyfriend ended up ordering but I do know his feeling on the food was also just \"meh\"

Unfortunately we won't be back :("}
{"text":"My friend and I went to try their brunch this morning... It was fabulous! Both my friend and I felt completely pampered and fussed over. The service was excellent and the food was even better! I found a smoothie, fortitude, that totally hit the spot and was beyond ecstatic to see they offer coffee, (I believe it was called the kickstarter) the way I make it at home with coconut oil. I have never seen any establishment offer that. I had the Full Monty. The moment it came out, I knew I ordered the right dish. It smelled mouthwatering. I think it even made my friend a bit jealous she had not ordered it too! The brussels sprouts were an an excellent addition to the plate. My friend ordered the house granola, fruit, and yogurt. It was beautiful, healthy and she said it was delicious. Next time we come, we will have to try the crepe bar. I had suspected Townhall would do a great brunch and I was right on point!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Townhall and I have to say I was very impressed! 

First of all, the atmosphere was super trendy and hip! I loved the incorporation of plants into the decor to emphasize the \"organic\" nature of the restaurant. *However, beware of outside seating if someone in your party is allergic to dogs because I saw at least 3 dogs in the outside seating area. 

Next, the food! My family ordered 4 dishes to share: the truffle fries, the Classico flatbread, the lamb rack, and the wild salmon. The truffle fries were absolutely delicious--crispy (and the aioli was to die for!). The flatbread was great as well but the true stars were the lamb and salmon. The lamb is so unbelievably tender and the salmon melts in your mouth! We also ordered a drip coffee that came free if you checked in on Yelp but it was rather watery.

Overall, the experience was great! The trendy decor, great service, and delicious food really made it a fun time!! 
The only thing I'd have to say is that if you are seated indoors, don't expect to hold a conversation because it is extremely loud and busy."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and pricing. I like the cafe side most because the service is that much faster and you can get in and out very quickly! They have a wide variety of food and drink choices. Looking forward to trying the crepe bar next time I'm in!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I have been to this restaurant many times and it's never a let down. The space is large, and the crowd is friendly. The smoothies are what keep me coming back though. Also it's in a good location and has a fun front and back open space when the weather is nice. It's a good place to meet one on one with somebody or bring a bunch of people for a birthday party of staff gathering."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just stopped in for a quick lunch and ended up getting a few mimosas too! They were delicious with fresh squeezed orange juice. The place is gorgeous! Very chill welcoming atmosphere and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Which was very tasty! The soup had blue cheese crumbles In it which I'm a fan of and will probably start adding in my own homemade tomato soup!  Long story short,  I enjoy the place and will definitely come back often! I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Worst blk bean burger I ever had! $11 for what seemed like black bean pudding. There was no substance at all very mushy not well-made or thought out. I would not recommend it at all, waste of money. Toppings included one thin sliced pickle, wilted lettuce and cheese and thin shaved stringy red onion. Black bean Burgers are one of my favorites but not here. Very disappointed. I barely ate half of it and set it aside and the waiter was like oh how was it. Obviously it was horrible. No refund not even offered to get me anything else."}
{"text":"On the 4th of July, this seemed to be one of the only places open on the block.  Other reviewers say that there's always a line on busy days (weekends and evenings), so I guess it's safe to assume there's no exception for holidays.  

We put our names in for a table but were able to snag two seats at the bar, which are first-come, first-serve.  The service at the bar was good because there were a few bartenders for the holiday crowd.  We never had to wait for refills or other service.  

The menu isn't very large and the veggie burger was meh.  It was pretty grainy and dry since it was loaded with some kind of grain (maybe quinoa? I can't remember).  The fries were good, though, because they were loaded with parsley and some parmesan, which is delicious.  My husband got the grilled cheese trio with tomato soup and I regret not getting the same thing.  His smelled and looked better and he really enjoyed it.

This is a decent place to go if you're with a group or looking to eat a whole mess of crepes since they have a make-your-own-crepe station.  I'd definitely do that another time because it sounds amazing but I didn't really understand how it worked when we went and I just wanted to get away from the crowds once we were done."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat for brunch this morning and were surprised to see that all of the places we were looking at were closed for Memorial Day.  We were happy to see that town hall was open and decided to stop in.

After waiting for a significant amount of time before the hostess acknowledged us, we put our names in and were told it would be a 30 minute wait.  As we were waiting, we noticed that they had a cafe attached to the restaurant that was almost entirely empty and decided to go there.  In this side, you order your food at a counter and sit down.  The menu on the cafe side seemed to have almost (maybe all) of the same menu items as the restaurant side.  I wished the hostess would have told us that this was an option in the first place.

I decided to do the custom crepe station, while my partner did the huevos rancheros.  I was blown away by my crepe-- which was savory and included egg, bacon, sausage, onion, cheese, and spinach.  They offered savory crepes, as well.  Whereas most crepe places I've been to have two batters-- one that is sweet, one that is more of a buckwheat savory batter, Town Hall only had one.  It was kind of sweet, light, and fluffy, and I actually really enjoyed it as a contrast to the savory fillings.  While I can't comment much on the huevos rancheros, my partner enjoyed them and loved that they were served right on a skillet.  

The entire concept of this restaurant is based on non-GMO foods that fall into a variety of healthful wellness categories-- paleo, vegan, etc.  They offer \"trendy\" health craze items like bee pollen topped smoothies, bulletproof coffee (coffee with butter in it), and more.  

The decor, menu, and music felt very contemporary and hip.  I instantly felt very cool being in this restaurant.. hahaha. :)  

All in all, it was a delicious brunch and we will be back to try some of the other menu items at the cafe, as well as the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it keeps getting better and better each time! The steak tacos were delicious and it's the best game experience I've had in Cleveland so far!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure which I loved more, the food or Kaitlyn and her wonderful service!
While in town for the US Men's soccer tournament, we had no idea where to go for food, but after chatting with a few employees at our hotel, we were directed to Townhall.
While I am not too familiar with CLE, I was shocked to discover that a vegan, vegetarian, gluten free restaurant even existed. I live in Chicago by way of San Diego, so I am used to dining at these type of establishments as it is the norm, especially Chicago with one of the best dining scenes on the planet, to include two 3 Michelin Star restaurants. 
To say I was impressed with Townhall is an understatement! My family and I dined on the lettuce wraps with chicken, shrimp food truck tacos, wild poke bowl, Classico flatbread, grassfed cheeseburger with truffle fries, and vegan salted caramel milkshakes. Everything was good, but the shrimp tacos, truffle fries and the vegan milkshake were the clear winners. 
Townhall is a great dining option for people that are more health conscious and I was so thankful to have discovered this little gem. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and food was great. Had the burger and street tacos both a must. Downside is a small patio with limited seating and hostess was non existent. The saving grace were the bartenders who were great and very helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible service, mostly high tables which are inaccessible, always packed, very loud, disorganized (servers don't follow up on how food was), no reservations yet it gets packed...overall bad experiences."}
{"text":"Townhall has a great atmosphere and vibe. It's definitely catering to a millennial audience and instagram foodies. It is also always packed. What is unique however is the multitude of vegetarian and vegan options available to customers. While my meal wasn't anything to write home about, I didn't get any of the items they were particularly known for. It is a decently good place."}
{"text":"Rude.  I was excited by their menu, but never got the chance to try them.  Called late Friday afternoon to inquire about reservations.  The response I got was, \"We don't take same day reservations.  Sorry.  Bye.\""}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place...We again were taken here by some great friends that bragged about it....The place was packed and really busy on Friday night after New Years....As a table we ordered the Nachos and Lettuce wraps for an appetizer. The lettuce wraps were not like the traditional ones you might get at PF Changs or somewhere which is what sets them apart..They serve them with small lettuce pieces and the chicken is cut into strips...The dish is served with pickled carrots, bean sprouts and onion I believe....They tasted amazing especially when you added either one of the 3 sauces they served with the plate....The nachos our friend ordered were also very delectable and something I would order again. For a cocktail I ordered a  tequila based drink which I wasn't impressed with on overall taste but I would definitely give the bartender another chance because everyone else at the table had nothing but positive reviews on their drink selections. For my main course I ordered the Kobe Beef Chesseburger at a medium temperature. My burger was served a bit overcooked which means that the taste was a little lacking for me....The truffle fries were amazing though...I would definitely go back and give them another try because they had so many positive things going on during my visit....If you are in the area I would definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Hate if you will, but the cafe side is my new go-to place for meetings.

Sometimes it gets a little old meeting at the same coffee shops over and over again--plus, I can only ingest so much caffeine before I either implode my heart or rip someone's head off. Townhall serves up plenty of coffee alternatives--like fresh and healthy juices, wheatgrass shots, etc. Plus you can sit near the front and enjoy the \"patio\" while keeping it straight biznass on the inside. Yes... you read that right. Or if it's a casual time, sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been to Town Hall a few times now.  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. There's always a good crowd and the service is great.  I also like how they have vegetarian Mondays!

This past visit, I ordered the grilled cheese and vegan chili. I added some avocado to the grilled cheese - delicious! The bread was toasted but not too crunchy.  I liked how they cut the sandwich into three pieces which made it more manageable.  The chili was good too, but it was a little spicy for me. I took it home and will be adding Greek yogurt to it. Next time, I will choose the tomato soup instead.

Great place for fresh food, plenty of vegetarian options, has traditional and fusion options - it's my favorite Ohio City restaurant!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular and stopped going because the service became so bad.  Not the wait staff but the kitchen.  Second to last visit our food came before our coffee (bullet proof) and both took over 30 minutes.  This time, my friend ordered an acai bowl and it never came after 40 minutes and me finishing my breakfast.   There are many other much better restaurants in Cleveland with excellent service, kitchens and menus."}
{"text":"Huge craft beer selection on tap, amazing vegan options, great atmosphere, and more!

After a day at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame Museum, I stopped here to get some dinner with my friend. 

The first two things I ordered were the Vegan Salted Caramel Milkshake and the Stuffed Banana Peppers. The milkshake was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweet and it tasted like there were actually pecans blended in there! They even give you the extra from when they make it, on the side. The stuffed peppers were unfortunately inedible for me. They were not seeded and were far too hot for my taste. It was a palate killer. I tried to have just the insides, but the spice was too overwhelming and was all I could taste. 

I got the Townhall Veggie Burger (sans aioli and sub vegan cheese and vegan bun) for the main course. I got it with the truffle fries and they were amazing! Lovely little matchsticks cooked and seasoned to perfection. A nice hint of truffle flavor with each bite. The burger was good and made with beets, rice, beans, and some other goodness! The bun was untoasted and nothing special but was soft and nice and the party could have been crispier. That might just be my preference though. Otherwise I was very appreciative of the fresh veggies on there and the flavor in general. 

The service was super fast and our server was amazingly attentive and friendly. Full of great suggestions too! 

Amazing fresh and inviting atmosphere! Love the theming. Outdoor area looks great as well. I posted some photos if you want to see. 

I would definitely return! Not sure if there's any hype about this place, but there should be. If you hear of any such hype, believe it!"}
{"text":"I am from California, so finding a non-GMO restaurant is like finding gold in Cleveland.
We've tried the:

Thai Peanut- 4 star
Beef Burger -5 star
Grilled Cheese -5 star
Beef Bolognese -5 star (they use zucchini noodles!)

We watched football and ate here, relaxed. Couldn't ask for a better place to chill and have a good bite here in Ohio City. 

*P.S. Mostly cute waitresses* 5 star for that as well."}
{"text":"Had the curry chicken noodles. Its not a curry but rather a crappy curry powder in broth. Okay, no big deal. But the veggies were so badly undercooked they were virtually raw, and hard, but not crisp like cooked veggies should be. Send it back. Get the same crap. Still complain, still no help. Wish I could give negative stars for horrible food and inept cooks and high servers."}
{"text":"I LOVE the gluten free/low carb options here. The beef bolognaise on top of a bed of spaghetti squash is my low-carb go-to dream! There is a wide variety of cocktails, wines and beers here - and the only reason I gave this 4 stars is the crowds. It's so busy here and when I do go, I have to wait. I hate waiting - even for great food. When seated I'm often bumped by patrons and servers bustling by, and it is a loud atmosphere. I still like the food and tend to visit on off times (earlier) to avoid the large groups."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Long wait. There was an opening at the bar, and right as we were about to sit down there, the bartender let some friends of his sit there instead. Way too packed/crowded. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were wandering around Ohio City and decided to stop here to give it a try, in part b/c it's facade looks cool and b/c it had some nice tables outside.
First, the place is huge, a little area on W25th, 2 big rooms inside, and a big patio in the back. All have a distinct style and are pretty cool.
Waiting staff was cute and fun, but I still learning the menu and way of the restaurant - part of being a new restaurant.
REgarding drinks, they have a huge beer list, many of which look great, and their mixed drinks are also really interesting.
I tried the Thirsty Dog Raspberry fruit ale. I quite enjoyed it. Good flavorful wheat beer.
My friend had a Roseate, which she enjoyed and I thought was interesting flavor-wise.
My friend got a Thai bowl, which was good. Nothing special, containing peanut sauce, noodles, and chicken. Solid, but what doesn't taste good with peanut sauce?
I had the BBQ chicken flatbread, which was huge. I didn't expect a pizza the size of the table. I ate it over the course of a few days (I watch my calories) and enjoyed it each day. Yay toaster oven! Loaded with cheese and sauce - good stuff.
I also got a Rocket salad, which really tasted quite good. Unlike most salads, worth the price.
Good place, definitely worth a try on a cool summer night"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only eaten here once.  I had brunch here on the morning of the Cavs parade and had the zucchini pasta. The \"pasta\" itself was fabulously done (sometimes it can be mushy, if not done well) and the veggies in it were fresh and tasty. The sauce left something to be desired, but I truly think it is a personal preference thing. The crepe bar looked good (which my friends had) and worth the small price tag. 

I've been here just for drinks once and again during Brite Winter when it was in OH City in 2015 and those times were great! The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and I would feel comfortable in yoga pants or in something a bit more dressy, too."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite overall restaurant in Cleveland. Great ambiance, consistently delicious food for a reasonable price and a bunch of fun drinks to try. It was the first place I was taken to when I visited Cleveland before moving here, and the first place I would introduce to any out of towner. There is a wait most of the time however there are plenty of other places on that street to grab a drink while you wait for a table.
Craft beers are conveniently all $5 each. Plenty of food options for vegans, vegitarians and carnivores- they even have paleo nights on Mondays. There is something for everyone at townhall."}
{"text":"Went to Town Hall with my daughter after an Indians day game. We were seated right away and our server Ariel was very good. My main complaint concerns the truffle fries. They were awful and I couldn't get that taste out of my mouth for hours. I recommend they ditch the truffle oil and serve regular fries. My daughter had the grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup which she seemed to enjoy. Our bill wasn't too bad and the experience was okay. I might be back for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"I love Town Hall and they're very kid friendly during kid friendly hours. Kids loved their toys and balloons. Vegetarian Mondays are a great way to have experimental vegetarian dishes. I really like the concept of coffeehouse and bar."}
{"text":"I'm a world traveler food expert! I've been to hole in the wall to the most expensive restaurants! My take on this place & believe me, I was expecting high hopes! Go to a hole in the wall or cook at home!! Portions are small, tacos/steak were cold & the waitress was terrible! Don't waste your money or time believe me I won't!! I knew there's a reason my friend refused to go!  Now, I get it!!! If you if travel enough you know this place is a wanna be! Not the real deal Wholefoods meals are better then this!!"}
{"text":"This is the full package bar/restaurant combo in the Cleveland area The service is friendly despite how packed the place gets. They seem to be knowledgeable about the beer menu which goes a long way for me. I have not experienced better 'bar-food' anywhere else in town quite honestly. Townhall is home to my favorite burger in Cleveland, the Kobe Beef cheeseburger. They compliment it with a hefty size portion of truffle fries, which adds great unique flavor. On the burger-- pickle, arugala, white cheddar, rosemary aioli. 

This is a definite go-to spot."}
{"text":"So me and my bestie come here semi frequently, we used to work at the market, but now we just come whenever we can. We love the food and atmosphere here, but mostly we love Shauna. Not sure if that's how you spell it, but she is    AHHHHH- MAZING!!! Absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"First visit to Cleveland on business and I'm thrilled my coworker took me to this cool place.  The beer selection is top notch - full of interesting craft brews.  I believe there were 35 beers on tap!  Bartender made great suggestions for me- he was a sweetheart and I feel terrible for not remembering his name.  

The menu - wow- as someone who aspires to the Paleo diet but with a heavy travel schedule the challenge is real!  It was so easy to eat here - delicious food with tons of paleo/ gluten free options.  And the dishes are designed to be paleo - not \"regular food\" that they've removed the bun and called it Paleo.  I ate here two nights in a row and I wish I were here for a third night!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a little bit overrated just based on how busy it always is, but I've eaten here a few times and the food is very good. It's great if you are looking for vegetarian or vegan options. Their offer a special vegan menu on Monday along with reasonably priced beers. Draft beer selection is excellent. Very loud and busy, but every bit of 4 stars and probably more like 4.5."}
{"text":"The food was great!  Loved that they had vegan options.  I have the tacos with beyond meat chicken, and my husband had the veggie burger.  Both were good but the veggie burger was the best .  Will be going back for the food for sure.  The beer list was nice too.  Our server Lauren was sweet and explained everything.  

My only complaint was it seemed they were over staffed.  When I used the restroom there were at-least  4 waitress complaining about tables and shift. Our table was close to the wait station so all we heard were the girls complaining.  Watched one girl sit under the bar station on her phone for a solid 10 mins. She was sitting on the step under the bar right next to the last bar stool which has a customer in it....if that costumer had moved her leg she would of hit this waitress sitting on the step.  Our waitress didn't take part in all of this; but it was still not what someone wants to hear while they eat."}
{"text":"I'm not as agitated with this place as some reviewers. I personally enjoy this place. 

The food is good; prices are fair, relaxed environment, and friendly service. Why would I be hating on that? Sure, they may not have in-house brewed beer, but I don't hold that against them. 

What they do have is great beer list, Mondays are $3 craft beer night, a fantastic happy hour, and lets not forget the coup de grâce; Thursdays are $12 double-cheeseburgers with shoestring fries and a milkshake. I've been here a few times since I moved to the Cleveland area and never had a bad experience. It is true that you will wait for a while if you go during a dinner rush, but you can still order a beer while you wait. 

They also do that \"get trashed and paint something\" evening. I don't know much about it, but I'm sure my wife will be dragging me to this soon."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland for game 4 of he NBA finals... Was looking for brunch the next day. Locals were talking about this place...

Man what a great decision! Brunch was sooo good. Very affordable, healthy choices. Win win win! 
Thinking about opening a restaurant like this! 

Definitely a must when in the 216!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fun location . Good food. My only complaint is that the area is getting so touristy."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. 

Great food-check
Great drinks-check

I mean, I feel like this is the kind of place that many people would enjoy. Some have described it as kinda \"bougie\" but coming from LA it's nowhere near what I'm used to. 

The patio is perfect for warmer months and kinda transports you into a different part of town. 

The food is absolutely delicious and love how vegan/vegetarian friendly they are! They also have weekly specials so be sure to check those out as well. 

They have a great list of beer options, which are nicely color coded with specific descriptors to help out those beer novices out there. 

The best part is there is ALWAYS parking in the back. I was always amazed to find many open spots even on the busiest of nights. Highly recommend this place."}

{"text":"My wife and daughter went veggie and they loved it.  I got the Bangkok bowl and the noodles were swimming in way too much sauce.  They need to dial down the flavor or add in more noodles...I like spicy Thai food, but they missed the mark.

This side of Cleveland is pretty cool, though!"}
{"text":"I am from Columbus, but I will drive the 2:15 minutes just to eat here, it's that good.  I had the gluten free Korean BBQ flatbread and the wife had the Food Truck tacos.  My flatbread was the star of the show, no idea it was GF, I was worried it was not as it was that good. It is a lively place, so be prepared for some loud folks."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Decided to spend my 21st bday here and the bartender straight up asked me why my ID wasn't horizontal. I turned 21 at midnight... IDs don't magically turn horizontal overnight.  Thank god they gave me a free shot, as a restaurant should on someone's 21st birthday, because I was about to tip ZERO $ because our service sucked.  

Details: after sitting down at a table our group of 7 ordered drinks and were all ID'd by the waitress. Minutes later a manager came over to double check our IDs. Upon receiving one of the IDs she said \"this is fake, honey\" to which my friend presented her passport ID proving it was in fact real. Instead of apologizing for her mistake she continued telling her about how the crease in her ID was a \"dead giveaway\" that her REAL ID was fake. The waitress then told another one of my friends that the manager had told her that his ID was fake, but the manager hadn't even seen his ID. We had the manager come back over to confirm the validity of his ID, and then he was finally served. There is a fine line between being careful about who you're serving and harassing customers. Multiple checks and accusing legal patrons of having fake IDs is a great way to drive out a younger crowd from the restaurant/bar. Aside from that, our waitress was very snippy and seemed like she had already clocked out when our table sat down. She seemed like she did not want to be serving us."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, both with alcohol and without.   The attractive wait staff doesn't hurt either.   I can't figure out why my 15 year old son wants to keep going back......."}
{"text":"I visit Cleveland from Philadelphia and I've been to Town Hall 4 or 5 times. I love the that there is an amazing beer selection (although you guys need more triples and quads represented!).   I am super appreciative of the Monday night vegan tonight. :-)"}
{"text":"I think Townhall has good food and I did enjoy a painting event here once, but the atmosphere at night is just not my style. I stopped in with three others one Friday evening and the bartender was friendly, but they were out of a lot of ingredients to make their cocktails (I think it was because they were about to switch over to new flavors?). We moved to a table and enjoyed several items like Smashed Avocado $9, Sweet Potato Skins $9, Chicken Nachos $10, and Paella Flatbread $14. 

While we were eating we noticed this young woman, very done up, who was clearly out of her mind intoxicated. I'm talking eyes barely open, bumping into people, randomly dancing by herself, and trying to flirt with every guy who would let her. She had a friend with her, but not a very good one because she kept leaving her to wander around. We couldn't watch this disaster anymore and asked our server to get a manager and have this young lady and her friend go home because we didn't want anything bad to happen with her being so drunk. Apparently other patrons had expressed concern earlier and finally the girl and her friend left. Hopefully to get in an Uber and sober up at home. 

Ten o'clock came around this place went from busy to packed, but like packed mostly with white guys in their young twenties unsure of what to do with themselves. There was one older guy who brought his pet rabbit in with him, and there were several young ladies very noticeably not wearing bras, but that was pretty much it.  

I'm only 31, but I guess I left this awkward, crowded, college like bar scene a long time ago and it's just not appealing anymore. I don't want to have to shout to my friend a foot away because it's so loud inside. I don't want to witness super drunk young women put themselves in potentially bad situations. I don't want to be surrounded by young guys who are still trying to grow facial hair. I left early for the comfort of my home and have no regrets. 

Townhall is a trendy popular place, so if you're into a bustling sausage fest full of \"bros\", a cougar on the prowl, or just like to get super wasted while partaking in some Non-GMO vegan food with a sparkler in it, then enjoy to your heart's content! Nowadays I prefer going to Whole Foods on Fridays where for $5 I can enjoy 5 wine samples, pick up some single serve dinners, and still get home by nine with plenty of time to put cream on my eye wrinkles. 

Seriously though, get take-out or maybe the environment might be better during daylight hours?

Update**
The above was a three star review, but I've had to lower it because of the response I received from Townhall staff. First Kayla B. wrote a comment, but she deleted it and now you see a comment from Alex D. 

Alex is upset that I said \"white guys\" in my review and insinuates this is a racist remark. So let me rephrase that, Townhall lacks diversity. If you are a minority you might feel uncomfortable here. Alex is also upset that I said \"young twenties unsure of what to do with themselves\". So let me rephrase that, Townhall is full of an immature crowd. If you are aged you might not feel congruous with the atmosphere here. Alex then states that \"wardrobe selections are protected free speech\". I suggest Alex reads up about human rights and freedom of expression/speech under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, or maybe even the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. I for one can't see where its says I'm not allowed to say what I saw: \"young ladies very noticeably not wearing bras\". I also said I saw a guy with a rabbit, does that mean I've insulted pet owners too? 

I like to use a little humor and satire when writing my reviews. In this particular one I even poked fun at myself at the end suggesting I'm just not young/cool enough for the scene at Townhall. And as Alex repeatedly mentions, I am an elite yelper, for several years now actually, and I think it's important for reviews to not just talk about the food and prices, but the patrons full experience including interactions with staff and the environment/crowd they encountered. With artistic license I set the scene for the night I came into Townhall and shared my experience - one review of hundreds that a reader can use to make up their own mind about Townhall. 

Alex seems to have taken my review very personally and tried to reprimand me with his comment, but to myself and those I've shared screenshots of his comment with, it appears Townhall just makes themselves look bad with their response. Bless their hearts."}
{"text":"Took the whole crew here for my wife's birthday. Service was fantastic, food was great, and the server caught that it was a birthday (they must have overheard us at the hostess station), and brought out a birthday dessert. Very vegan-friendly, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Townhall is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite places to hangout with friends in Cleveland!  From ambience, to service, to the food... this joint has its act together and is topnotch is every regard!

During my most recent visit,a group of my friends and I stopped in for a quick meal before SuperBowl( GoPats!). The restaurant was packed to capacity when we got there. However they have a nice system in place where they text you once they have your table ready, giving you the freedom to walk around. In our case we stopped for a quick drink at the NanoBrew two doors down...& by the time our drinks were done... our table was ready! That was the easiest 20 min table wait I have ever had!!

The Restaurant had the SuperBowl theme going. There was a tally board for what looks like bets for the teams. The vibe of the place was vibrant and energizing!! Loved it! Our sever was an absolute sweetheart... she did not rush us, made some great suggestions and rolled with the punches that our table threw her way!

I decided to go with the bacon wrapped dates and lamb burger...mmmmm soooo GOOD!!
The Bacon wrapped dates were delicious starters however for me after two of them it was a Lil too sweet. 

The lamb burger was another story all together! Divine, delectable, scrumptious... you name it & it was it! MUST TRY!!!

I tried the margarita pizza which wasn't bad either. 

Overall: Townhall is a fun place to spend time with friends while enjoying a super meal!!"}
{"text":"I live New Jersey and I went to Cleveland to visit friends. I was so excited to visit this establishment because heck....I was on vacation and why not!!!  First impressions...it looked steam punk/garden bar/sports bar type place. It was sandwiched between brewery's and glass blowing shoppes on a very busy street. Going inside was a chore but everyone was nice and accommodating...very different from back home...eh hem.  The bar menu was beaming with 100s of craft beers and the waitress was super knowledgeable about all of them.  The food menu was vegan, meaty, organic, brothy cheesy...all the good things for any palette and diet!! Right down to green juices and machta. I had a veggie noodle primavera which was so fresh and flavorful!! If I ever go back to Cleveland. I will go back"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. If you have a chance to try their steak, it is one of the best I've had. Fair prices and great quality food, everything is organic and they have a large selection of liquor."}
{"text":"I was staying in the Ohio City area of Cleveland and on my first night, I wandered down 25th Street looking for dinner. It was Labor Day Monday so a lot of places were closed. The Ohio State game was on TV so all the bars were loud - too loud for me. (I'm not a football fan.) Thankfully someone suggested the outdoor seating at Townhall. I was pleased to see that they had special vegan options but they were all too fancy for my liking. I ordered a rice bowl with veggies and peanut sauce. My meal was good but I would have preferred more veggies, less rice. 

If I'm ever back in Cleveland, I'd consider this place again, preferably not on a football night."}
{"text":"Great patio if you can squeeze into one of the few open spots. The servers are always nice but overworked so they can't get to you as fast as they would like. The food is decent, average prices. I don't at all like the inside of the restaurant at night. It's pretty \"clubby\" which is odd for the feel of the restaurant. 

I basically only reviewed this place for a drink in the summer or fall, they do have a great Manhattan :)"}
{"text":"By far the best selection and healthiest option you will see on W25th St. in Ohio City!  They are phenomenal at fitting most dietary needs and offer all Non GMO ingredients. They have recently joined forces with Restore to deliver some of the best Cold Pressed Juices in Cleveland. There truly is a fit for everyone at Townhall! Whether you just want to chill with friends for a Saturday or Sunday Brunch, (Try the Sweet Potato Hotcakes or Crepe station) go out on the town for the night and experience the best 36 alternating draft beer menu in CLE, or dine in on Monday Vegan/$3 craft Beer night. Either way you will definitely not be disappointed. If you haven't been yet then come in and see for yourself. The food, beer and exceptional service will keep you coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. Not worth price.
Went with my friends for brunch and asked for a fruit juice. Asked the waitress specifically to just blend pineapple chunks so that the juice would not be clear (more like a smoothly) and she brought me a pre-packaged juice in a glass.

Then I got excited with the crepe menu. It has a variety of options INCLUDING \"add one egg\". Then I asked my egg to be poached, Benedict style, and the waitress said the egg can only be scrambled. Then I insisted for my beloved poached egg, and with a bitchy smile she just repeated herself with a \"it can only be scrambled\". I told her that was just ridiculous and she just remained there waiting for my order, so I actually had to order something else. No crepe!

Horrible breakfast experience. My appetite just went away. After that I wasn't even hungry anymore"}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC, and I wish I could bring this place home...

Craft beers, great food, vegan options for my friend were all delicious. Our waitress got us our food immediately,  and was friendly, helpful...it was a great experience. I wish I could return at night - the atmosphere seemed perfect for a summer night out with a patio and open doors in front and back."}
{"text":"If you're VEGAN, you can actually eat here! I had the taco's, so delicious. It so nice to be able to pick from several items, I get so tired of eating salads! My friend ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup, she said it was excellent.  Vegan or not, check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try again on Saturday 14th 2018. I didn't receive good service the last time I was here. I sat in a different area in the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive. Wayyyy better than the last one. Man when are they not busy??? This place was packed at 1pm. I should of known since it was a Saturday in Cleveland. I wanted to use my 25$ gift card I received from the owner for my bad experience last time. It was well worth it!
I ordered the unsweetened mango ice tea. Boy was that good! I order the full monty on the brunch menu. Holy deliciousness!! A complete organic meal! Root Vegetable and larden hash, sweet potato purée, Brussel spouts, poached egg, spinach, and maple berry sorghum thick cut bacon. Geeez so tasty for being healthy! Applause! I plan to come back to try more! Prices are decent. My total check was $16.20 not including tip. With the gift card it was all free! Thank you Townhall for the gift card and making such great healthy food. It was good fuel before my yoga session! 
I totally recommend this place but come early because there will be a wait unless you can snag a bar seat. It's worth the wait. Great atmosphere for groups or being alone. I like to people watch and this is a good place for it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And great options for Vegan friends. The atmosphere and location are great too. We've brought our 2-year old and have come Kids-free and had great food and good service. This a great place to take out-of-town friends and family."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. The music, while sitting on the cafe side sounds like 17 year olds bass playing in his Ford Fiesta. So bad I wanted to get our food to go. Whose the dj here?"}
{"text":"Large and wide selection of brews on tap! Something to note is that their lunch menu starts at 2:30 pm. Before brunch is the only option available. Thai peanut was a decent price and full of flavor. The southern comfort was well seasoned, could have used more gravy. waiters and waitresses were well informed on all menus."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch, weekday lunch, dinner, happy hour and nights out. One of my favorite spots in Cleveland. This place is all about natural and healthy ingredients, which I am a huge fan of. I have yet to find something on the menu that I do not like, but the veggie burger and smashed avocado (guac) may be my favorites. I will say if you're a big meat and potatoes fan and like traditional cooking, like my dad, you may not like this place because it is very farm fresh. They have a great beer menu and everything is $5! It also gets crowded during popular times, especially brunch, and they don't take reservations. Also during brunch they have a crepe station with a chef prepping them made to order. If you are in the Ohio City area this is a must try."}
{"text":"Flanked by two large open outdoor patio seating areas sits an eclectic mix of patrons at beautifully crafted wooden tables.  On w 25th street just a few doors down from the west side market.  

Tomato bisque soup was thick and delicious with just the right amount of Gorgonzola cheese.  The side salad of spring mix with sprinkling of goat cheese and dates was just the right size to accompany the hearty size soup bowl.  The grilled cheese bites that also accompanied my friends big bowl of soup were served up on a wooden chopping board.  :-)  my other friends had the perfectly cooked Kobe beef burger and generous portion of fries and the Thai peanut bowl.   

Only remark is that the waitress seemed a bit confused when my friend asked for extra spicy on the Thai dish.  The kitchen staff added some sirarache sauce to kick up the heat.  

Fresh squeezed juice was delicious! 

Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"$5 craft beers with a wide selection. Fantastic! Food's pretty good. Flatbread was great!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite brunch place in Cleveland. I ordered smoothie Maui Wowei which tasted a little bit like the body shop hand coconut lotion, but in a good way. I also build my own salty crepe with unlimited selection, and I picked bacon, goat cheese, guacamole and prosciutto mushrooms and onions. Our waitress was super friendly and gave a a great overview of the menu, drinks, and events. I highly recommend visiting Townhall!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB.COM. I came here a couple months ago with some friends for Sunday brunch. Amazing food,atmosphere,drink selection,and wait staff. BEST PLACE IN CLEVELAND. Hands Down"}
{"text":"Love this place and it's farm-to-table like concept! Love the mission and their commitment to serving whole, fresh, healthy foods. This was my second visit. The first time I had the burger. Umm umm good. This time I had the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. Again, very tasty and the service is excellent. Our server was awesome and very friendly. It's a busy place. We went on a Monday evening and it was upbeat (lively music) and well attended at 6pm. Kinda club-like or an upbeat, lounge vibe. The ambiance was even more awesome with the holiday lighting and decorated Christmas tree out back. If you're undecided between this place or the one down the street (I'm referencing to particular restauntant, lol), choose this one. I think you'll be satisfied. Oh yeah, they have huge beer and bourbon selections."}
{"text":"Overhyped poorly executed hipster food. Not to mention the owner supported Trump and Wahoo. Vote with your dollars if you don't like patronizing businesses that support bigots and racist mascots. I've had three good dishes here (sweet potatoes, bangkok bowl, and the tomato soup) out of the three of time I have been dragged here as part of a group. There are much better places to eat and spend your money in Ohio City."}
{"text":"TownHall is THE spot in Cleveland!! Fantastic food with vegan/paleo/gluten free/keto options, everyone can find something to enjoy! The draft list has 37 craft beers on it, unique and delicious cocktails, and extensive liquor options. Always decorated so beautifully and festive. TownHall also hosts events constantly, including beer schools and hosting fundraisers!! I truly feel blessed to be apart of such an amazing family at TownHall."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool. We enjoy this bar when the weather is nice and their back patio is open. If you are lucky enough to get a table, the service is pretty good. If you can't get a table, crowding around the bar works too. This place is always packed so I am sure they are doing a pretty good business. We ordered a couple of appetizers last time we were there, they were ok. Nothing special. But they did the trick."}
{"text":"Great brunch, the crepe bar looked delicious as well. I had the 'full monty' skillet and orange juice. The skillet was an wonderful combination of flavors and everything was prepared appropriately; crispy potato/beet mix, poached egg, sweet potato purée. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and the staff was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a work party at Townhall last week and I can't say enough good things about it. The general manager and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a positive experience. The beer selection is fantastic and reasonably priced. A lot of us ordered off their cocktail list and everyone seemed to enjoy them all. The place was busy while we were there but service was never lacking."}
{"text":"Happy to \"edit\" my review!  EXCELLENT service, food and great atmosphere!  Will DEFINITELY be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I went back to Townhall and definitely had a better experience in terms of both service and food. I ordered a different noodle bowl and it was definitely better than the spicy chicken one. I still don't love it, and Townhall isn't an iconic or particularly unique CLE place in my book, mostly due to inconsistency, but it's definitely a decent place to grab a bite. Would still recommend avoiding the brunch rush--go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great choice of beers, fast friendly service and great daily specials make this place a lively and happening place"}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEATS to my hotel and I was so surprised to find this kind of food in Cleveland!  I had a horrible time choosing from the menu because of all the options but settled on the cauliflower tabbouleh, zucchini pasta and paleo chocolate chip cookie.  All were fantastic.  I'm going to attempt to make their cookie at home.  I only wish they had a sister restaurant in Washington D.C. where I live."}
{"text":"Can't speak highly enough of this place! Stopped in for Sunday brunch... Super busy, but we got seated within 15 minutes. Staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. Food was FANTASTIC! Had sweet potato pancakes and eggs Benedict. Five stars!!! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great service. 
Great atmosphere. 
Great ambience.
The food just didn't suit me. I like the new/healthy vibe but the food portions were small and just for a foodie it didn't suit me. 
The food was very underwhelming. 
Vegan friendly.  
1:00pm and I couldn't hear my self think but on the right occasion I enjoy a busy bar.

{"text":"I love the drinks, the nachos and the place is amazing to go and have fun. The moscow mule is refreshing and very good. The restaurant tables are big if you want to celebrate something with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Townhall is a very fine addition to the WSM district of Ohio City. The food is phenomenal and fresh. It is always a delight to meet friends there for dinner and beverages or for brunch before hitting the market. 

They have a wide selection of entrees and sandwiches that are as flavourful as they are adventurous. The beer selection is tremendous and the waitstaff is always gracious and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the wait staff was attentive. The menu is a refreshing change and the BBQ flat bread meal was  tasty  The outside deck looked really nice as well."}
{"text":"Decided to give TH a second chance after the PR rep for the restaurant reached out apologizing for my previous visit. She provided an incentive for us to visit again, so we took her up on that offer.

We arrived around 1230 and we requested an outdoor seat. We were told an hour+ wait, which was fine as we wanted to shop the market and grab a beer at GLBC. We ended up only needing to wait about 20mins, which was a pleasant surprise. I love when restaurants text you about your table. Makes life so much better. 

We were seated outside on the patio at one of two tables without an umbrella. It's was a sunny 90* day. I didn't mind it but my wife was wearing a tank top so her arms were fried by the end of lunch. We noticed other groups that they tried to seat at the other umbrella less table were quick to ask for another location.

Our waitress was training with another more tenured waitress. Things started off great. Quick service and polite. 

Food: I had the grass fed burger with truffle fries. They cooked the burger exactly how I asked and it was juicy... all great things. The fries were tasty and the truffle oil was great, just a little over cooked. My wife had a kale salad and she enjoyed her meal as well. 

When it came time for the bill of around $40 for 2 drinks and our meal, I presented a gift card and cash to cover the remaining balance. The trainee was assisted by the tenured waitress in entering the info into their computer. She then came back with our change and asked \" did you want your change?\" Hmmmm... ya that'd be great if I could get MY money back. My change would have been $8.76... my intent was to give her $8 and I wanted the change for a meter. However she came back with $9... Not a big deal, but I hate when a waitress assumes they deserve a certain amount of tip. I always leave as close to 20% as possible... but allow me to make that decision... Having to ask for my money back is uncomfortable 

It gets worse... on our way out we stopped off in the bathroom.  The hallway is narrow but this is inexcusable. When my wife was finished up and coming towards me an employee(male) who appeared to have some authority was walking up from behind my wife quickly and made an attempt to move past her... rather than saying excuse me he literally brushed right into her, looked back at the both of us, and then carried on to speak with one of the female waitresses... 

All I can say is we tried to give them a second chance. The food is mediocre and clearly their staff is clueless and unprofessional. I understand now why Denver has such great service in restaurants... they pay their waiters well and they take pride in their work...

Side note: it was fun watching one of the blonde waitresses ignore her tables while she flirted with a guy by himself at one of the large cabana style tables(not her table)... I would have been irate if I was one of her tables. She was flirting it up with this guy on 3 separate occasions for around 5-10min a piece... great customer service"}
{"text":"Townhall is great place to watch games.  I loved the patio.  The lamb burger w truffle fries was tasty and filling.  Also tried a fortitude smoothie which was healthy and not bad tasting.  I would probably get a different smoothie or a cocktail or app in place of it.  The menu has some healthy options. The place in general is pretty noisy.  Its a good place for groups."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and non-gmo! Try their Fireball shots. can get very crowded at night but the servers and bartenders and quite helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"SKILLET COOKIE. That's all I need to say. You can come here for their many excellent (and cheap) craft beers on draught, sit on their giant (dog-friendly!) patio complete with comfy seats and fireplaces, and sample their diverse menu if you want, but I will return again and again for the skillet cookie. It comes in a skillet (obvi) and served piping hot with a scoop of Mitchell's vanilla bean ice cream. The chocolate chip cookie is the perfect blend of cakey cookie goodness. You can probably share with someone, if you're into that. Apparently they also have a skillet brownie which is a new item on their menu (*dies slowly*). 

I came here with a large group and table service was unbelievably excellent. They were so attentive and the bar was crowded. Overall a fun spot for good drinks and dessert! I will definitely be back to try their entrees. But really skillet cookie."}
{"text":"Who would've thought the tastiest veggo burger is in Cleveland, Ohio? And a fine beer selection to boot."}
{"text":"Maha and I came to Townhall to watch Brazil play and boy did they give us a proverbial heart attack!  
We had the thai curry and the burger and both were AWESOME.  They have a huge list of beers and make a mean Bloody Mary.  We needed several beers to get through the penalty shots but ultimately we prevailed.  Their service was friendly without being over bearing and they were amused by our overzealous soccer watching.  I totally get the appeal of this place.  Go here-enjoy."}
{"text":"10 ounce beer pours for full pour prices?  Not for me.  Asked the server how big the pour was.  She said 12 ounces.  Took glass home.  Measures 10.  That is a freaking half pint at a full pint price.  Food OK."}
{"text":"Amazing jalapeno poppers - the freshest and largest you can find anywhere.  Spicy enough, but not overwhelming (YMMV).  I had the bulgolgi.  the meat was really tender and fresh vegetable, but it was too salty.  not a deal breaker because of their amazing appetizers and drink menu."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance with a pleather of beer. Definitely a little pricey but a must stop on W.25

PS- What exactly does a Free High Five get you when you check in on Yelp? Please Let me know...clearly the bar tenders had no clue."}
{"text":"Whoa, holy shit this place is busy all the fucking time. There are so many drunk dudes in this place I feel as if I'm back in college at a frat party with horny and drunk 20-something's all over the place trying to get some sweet, sweet action.The employees look as if their souls have left their bodies and there is no more hope left in the world. 
Everything is loud and expensive. 
The food here is ok, and the coffee bar is not the best but hey, it's coffee and sometimes my need for that boost of caffeine overrides my feelings for this place. 
Overall though, not a fan.

*Edit* 
So, I originally gave this place 2 stars. However, after talking to some current and past employees I  learned how sexist and abusive the owner is to his female workers. Yeah, I don't support any business that treats their employees like that. I encourage everyone else to find a better spot to drink and be merry and get food and whatnot. There are a lot of great options in the area at least, and those places to my knowledge don't abuse their workers."}
{"text":"This is just hip meat market.  Just a place to drink and be seen.  I like the look and the beer choices and my star is for that.  This review is mainly on the food.  I will keep it short.  Had many apps and the \"authentic street tacos\".  I wanted to fight somebody for my money back.  Pure rubbish."}
{"text":"A great, hopping restaurant with lots of space and a good menu.

I got the loaded sweet potato skins which were pretty good. Roasted in half, with crispy sweet edges and topped with bacon, chicken and a good white sauce. It's not as heavy as I thought it would be and was a healthy alternative to regular loaded potato skins. I also got their pasta bolognese with zucchini noodles. The sauce was good and the noodles were good too (although I wish they offered a real pasta alternative) but I thought the poached egg was too undercooked. 

My server was really friendly and the space was family friendly!"}
{"text":"Townhall, oh how I love your beers, food, GAMES, and atmosphere.  One side is more chill with seat yourself and games and the other is sit down and get service.  When Monday nights come around, you can't beat the $3 dollar draft beers.  I had this grapefruit traveler and it was like a little taste of citrus heaven in my mouth.  So many beers for you to try and a really cool menu to look at.  Kudos on how they break down the menu by light, dark, citrus etc.  I loved it.  I was able to pick a beer much better suited to me more quickly than most menus.  I had regular burger with fries.  FRIES, my true love, these don't disappoint.  And I really appreciate the fact that they made my burger medium rare.  Place is crowded but come on, its a bar kids what do you expect.  The crushed avocado was not to shabby either.  Yes, the creaminess the smoothness, the avocado not to shabby.  Definitely come here for a game night or just a chill night at the bar.  During the weekends this place is popping so if you want a more relaxed crowd, probably not the place for you.  But if you want great craft beer, good bar food and a loud crowd, this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"I tried Town Hall for the first time for my birthday dinner with friends, with high hopes, but overall I was quite disappointed. We were told 30 minutes to wait when we arrived, which seemed reasonable, but it took over an hour to be seated. The only saving grace for this experience was my burger, which did not disappoint. However, my truffle fries were underseasoned, did not taste at all like truffle, and arrived cold. Disappointing birthday.

Update: Pleased to say their customer service was prompt in working to ensure this does not happen again and is working to make this right."}
{"text":"Townhall is consistently delicious, whether for brunch, lunch or dinner. They have a varied menu emphasizing fresh, natural ingredients, complete with paleo, vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. Their flatbreads, burger, salads, and rice bowls are all delicious.

Today I started my meal with the usual - their bone broth, which is hands down the best broth ever. I can't get enough of it, and it's so good for you. I didn't have time to end it with their skillet cookie this time around, but that's fantastic, as well!

It can get very busy, particularly at peak hours, but I'd always recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday with a party of 5 adults plus a baby. The atmosphere is great, the overall vibe is awesome and the food even tasted delicious but we ran into a major problem. I'm breastfeeding my four-month-old daughter who has allergies to dairy, soy, and eggs. My sister is vegan with celiac so she absolutely can't have gluten. We were very clear on these issues with our server and she approved all our choices after answering some questions re: ingredients. The fries still came with cheese on them and replacements took a long time. Worst of all, my sister and baby both reacted to the food and got sick. This was the only place we ate at besides our own kitchens the entire week.

Either the server made a mistake or the kitchen did. Either way, I have a screaming sick baby and my sister is down for the count too. It's really disappointing.

As I said, the food was actually quite good and the other people in our party were very happy - I'd even come again if allergies weren't in play - but if you can't properly accommodate special dietary requests (especially when that's something you claim to specialize in) then just say you can't. I would've been very understanding, skipped lunch, and not be watching my daughter writhe in pain."}
{"text":"Forever one of my \"must-stops\" whenever I'm back home in Cleveland. The staff is always incredibly friendly and seem to go above and beyond of what's expected to make your experience flawless. Townhall is most well-known for it's brunch; menu and atmosphere. The sweet potato pancakes or Rock Shrimp tacos always hit the spot. Crepes are a popular pick as well as the Fully Monty. Honestly, ALL OF THE FOOD IS GOOD. Great food. Great service. Great times. Love this place. Adam is awesome too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here, and there's a wide beer selection which they do allow you to sample to find the right one for you. Their house made Bloody Mary mix is amazing; so fresh and full of flavor!  They sell the mix to go, too! Pretty much all the staff was really friendly, and it had a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is killer, prices are good and the patio is awesome. 4 stars because how they do the seating is a joke. We go once a week or so and always wait 30-60 mins even when I am staring at empty tables with \"reserved\" signs on them. It's annoying but not a big enough deal to stop going."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a meal and drinks, regardless of the time of day. Great draft list and a menu of milk shakes and specialty juices. Food never disappoints and they have something for everyone. 

My favorite appetizers are the truffle fries (fresh cut, perfectly seasoned), the prosciutto wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese (the perfect bite, a blend of savory, salty, and sweet -yum!!), and the chicken and chili nachos (fresh, flavorful and great for sharing). I also recently tried the crispy tofu wings, which are on the monday night vegan menu - great texture, definitely go for the buffalo sauce. A new addition is crudités with white bean and kale hummus and olive tapenade (the tapenade was exceptional).

For meals, I usually go with one of the flatbreads. The west side market veggie is my favorite - super fresh ingredients that come right from the market next door! They also do a really great burger deal on Thursday nights as well that comes with a side and either a milkshake or draft. The Kobe beef makes for a moist, tasty burger - I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of the best burgers I've had in the city!

They also have a great brunch and late night menu. When the weather is warmer, the outdoor patio is great as well!"}
{"text":"Wow! Townhall, we were first time visitors on Friday, but we can now say we will forever be lifelong fans and patrons of this fine establishment! The line was crazy long to be seated at a table so we chose to sit at the bar. Our bartender, Erin was phenomenal! She took us under her wing and helped us review the eclectic drink and food options. Lots of vegan, ketogenic, and paleo options... but let me be clear... ever thing is made with particular attention given to quality ingredients, amazing flavor and food that is not only delicious, but truly nutritious! Erin's suggestions and genuine care of our experience made us feel like friends, even family of the restaurant. The burgers were delicious and my friend had the roasted veggies while I tried the bone broth! Let me tell you, that bone broth was the best I have ever had. Flavorful and savory! My friend had several drinks and I was given a sample of the ginger lemonade. We finished our meal with a nitrogen infused coffee and the opportunity to meet the owner. From start to finish, townhall is an amazing community asset and receives my highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great food & great service. Reservations are recommended! I came here on a Wednesday for lunch and although it was relatively busy with parties and having to wait 15 minutes to be seated, the server took great care of us and had our food out so quick, only took maybe 5 to 10 minutes. I tried the vegan chicken tacos, although I am not vegan, and they were delicious! I definitely want to come back here to try brunch!"}
{"text":"I love the burger and truffle fries! Fast and friendly service. The menu has a lot of healthy options as well."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly which is awesome, but I'm always a little underwhelmed when I go there and it isn't really worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you're foodies like we are, then this is a must-try while in Cleveland.  Being Florida natives, we take pride in our local, non-GMO food scene.  Townhall does the exact same, with focus on an exclusively non-GMO menu.  The vibe here is driven by people who are obviously passionate about their food, their beer and their coffee.  The aesthetics are rustic and inviting.  And the staff are friendly and informative.

My husband and I, visiting from Florida for a long weekend, tried the Harvest Salad which entailed a gorgeous array of mixed greens, sweet potato, perfectly crisp thick cut bacon, pear, candied walnuts and goat cheese with a touch of cranberry vinaigrette.  It was crunchy, sweet yet tart...it had everything to satisfy our palates completely.  

We also had the Food Truck Tacos, in which the nice guy taking our order allowed us to mix-n-match - two prom carnitas and one rock shrimp.  The corn tortilla was fresh as were the toppings which included a guacamole mix with tomatoes and onions.  The carnitas were tender and flavorful, yet not soggy like some tend to be.  The Rock shrimp was perfectly executed, with a bit of a bite, not chewy.  Highly recommend this dish if you're a taco fanatic like I am.

We also tried a local brew out of Columbus called Bodhi, which again recommended by our lovely order taker.  It was a perfect match to our salad and tacos.  Super hoppy with citrus and pine but perfect portion, as it came in an 8oz. glass given the high alcohol content.  

We're in love with Townhall, applaud what they are providing Ohio City and the rest of us visitors who are lucky enough to stumble upon this unique gem.  We can't wait to come back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"\"Cute blonde and bouncy boobs only go so far.\"
My husband and I went this afternoon just before 3.  And it was explained to us that they're only serving brunch before 3. Fine, although the brunch menu's kinda limited, we're willing to give this place a shot since we live around the corner.  I ordered a smoothie, specifically asking to have it in a to-go cup since I can never finish a smoothie quickly, and my husband ordered a beer.  We also ordered our food with very simple instructions (salad instead of chips). 

My smoothie finally came, in a regular glass.  I said it's fine, and cute blonde server went on her merry way. While we were waiting for our food (a long time), our server seemed to be milling aimlessly. We asked about my husband's beer, and cute server blamed the bar for being slammed and backed up.  Although other people at nearby tables who came after us didn't seem to have trouble getting not one but two rounds of beers.

Our food finally came (chips showed instead of salad), and beer never came! In the meantime my husband was never offered even a glass of water!  When we asked again about the beer, again cute server rolled her eyes and blamed the bar for being slammed.  Check was brought out with the beer charge on it, so we asked our server to just take it off.  Again it took forever as we were just twiddling our thumbs.  Needless to say, we won't return despite the super convenient location!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here!  I was so ExCiTeD to see they had house made GingerAle on the menu!  AND OMG  it was to die for. (I had to have 2) But, I did not stop there :)  I had the most Yummy Milkshake -the Mochachino.  Oh, yes the food was most delicious too.  I had the Bombolotti.  Everyone had something different, which they all loved!  Our friends were sampling the extensive beer menu and they were pleasantly pleased by the selections.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this review is specifically about their (Saturday) brunch. 

PROS
-Solid patio. We had a party of 8 and we comfortably sat at a hightop under an umbrella on their back patio. We lucked out with the weather and had a perfect sunny, 70 degree day. And bonus - you don't have to be super dressed up to feel at home here. Our group had just come from a yoga place and we had all of our gear on.
-Space. The back patio + inside + limited front patio adds up to be one enormous restaurant. If you have a large party, this is a great place for you. And if you are lucky, you can sit in one of the cabana-looking areas.
-Healthy and Accommodating Food. Soon after we sat down, our waitress mentioned that they had all non-GMO food and that they have options to accommodate many types of food allergies and diets (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, paleo, gluten-free, etc.). 
-Beverage options for days. I got juice, the Greengo, and everyone was green with envy (ha, see what I did there). They had lots of other juice, smoothie, coffee, and of course, alcohol, options - the entire back page of the brunch menu was dedicated to it, plus a separate list for beer.
-Nitro Coffee. Apparently this was the big trend last year, but I am just now discovering this special brew. I actually didn't even order it - a friend did, I tried it and was immediately jealous. It was rich and creamy and buttery and amazing. 
-Dog Friendly. Both inside and outside. 

CONS
-No brunch reservations. Unfortunately, while there is a lot of space at the restaurant, if you have a big party, you may have to wait to be seated, since they don't take reservations for brunch. Bummer.
-Parking. If you are heading here on a Saturday after 9a, be prepared to be patient or walk. This is a busy area (West Side Market is a nearby neighbor) and parking can be tricky.

BOTTOM LINE
This should be on your summertime brunch check list. And don't forget to bring your pup!"}
{"text":"Seriously, what a fantastic night! Thank you so much! Jordan was a rock star. We can't wait to return and those truffle fries are dangerous."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland for the variety of healthy and not-so-healthy options on the menu. Plus, the dog-friendly menu is so fun and being able to dine with your pooch on the patio is a serious perk for Cleveland when it feels like virtually nowhere allows dogs. The only downside is that it can get really crowded and that is never fun."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Townhall and was excited to be in the area for work and grab lunch there! I stood in the order line and talked to a couple people in line - they recommended the burger or the soup/salad combo for lunch. I went with the chicken tacos, they say spiced but they are far from spicy. I added guac too. They had a good taste but they weren't filled very full, for $11 I expected fall out of the shell chicken/toppings. 

I can see why this place is popular for drinks - nice patio and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really appreciate that they have Vegan Mondays and a nice vegetarian selection. More places need to start understanding that not everyone wants to eat meat with every meal and that having completely vegan meals can be very delicious and healthy. I had a good (not great) vegan chili, amazing avocado tacos, awesome beers and cocktails, and an amazing vegan peanut butter chocolate something-er-another. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday brunch. Try the Southern Comfort biscuits & gravy or the sweet potato pancakes. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Townhall. My husband and I go there for breakfast about once a month. The food is amazing. The sweet potato pancakes are awesome. Bacon is thick cut goodness. The Southern Comfort is an amazing combo of biscuits, gravy, eggs and sausage. Seriously the best breakfast. Decor is great. They have great coffee and a crepe bar. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Townhall has its ups and downs.

It's always really crowded and hard to get seating. They change the menu a lot so it's hard to have a favorite dish and it seems the menu gets more complicated to read each time. Sometimes the crowd isn't great.

On the plus side, the food is really good. The prosciutto wrapped dates are a MUST. Their tacos and grilled cheese/soup is also worth a try. Their mixed drinks are a little pricey but unique so one or two is worth it. They have a wide variety of beer and cider. The wait staff is always friendly. I have a food allergy and they've always taken it very seriously.

It's a good staple bar/restaurant in Ohio City."}
{"text":"The Dyngus Day dash took us to Townhall. Sadly, the race was cancelled. We decided to stay for a drink. They offered a small Polish menu for the occasion, but I really had my heart set on pierogie, 

Anyway, I was recommended a beer that I really enjoyed. We also shared some yucca sticks and nachos. Yucca sticks were interesting! Nachos were fine. Lots of options on the menu that looked appealing, but not sure it was my \"scene.\" Maybe it's yours!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Popcorn Tofu Nuggets, Tempeh Gyro, and the Wild Mushroom Chimichangas. They gave two good size chimichangas, and they were very delicious. The gyro was also good, but I've had better ones. The popcorn tofu nuggets was disappointing. It wasn't necessarily bad, but I wouldn't order it again. Out of the three, I would definitely get the chimichangas again, but not the other two."}
{"text":"Two stars mainly because my expectations were too high.  The wait was extremely long (longer than they predicted) and the food was alright, just over-priced and over-hyped.  It was also pretty dark at the table, which I'm not a huge fan of."}
{"text":"Food and beer are consistently impressive. Even their coffee is incredible! Despite being huge they are always crowded and on a wait list which is a shame but can't blame them for that."}
{"text":"Anyone who reads my Yelp reviews probably thinks \"ugh this annoying a**hole\" but I'm for sure honest, just an annoying Yelp amateur food critic. I gotta give credit where credit is due though. The first appetizers we ordered were sub-par (I'm not going to list them because I have friends who have really enjoyed them and I'm going to just say it was an off night) The restaurant immediately removed them from our bill and replaced them with a fantastic lettuce wrap app. My bolognese was off the charts good served over zucchini noodles and my friends poke bowl was stellar. Drinks were great, service was great. They took what could have been a very negative experience and completely turned it around. Thanks Townhall!"}
{"text":"Updating my review to add (7/30/17) that Townhall accommodated my boyfriend's 30th birthday party spectacularly by reserving the large outdoor cabana for us and providing a server who was always checking back to see whether we needed anything else. I brought in my own cake and they even provided us with a fun sparkler candle! Thanks Townhall. You're great! 

Consistently the best place with interesting and tasty food and a beer list constantly changing. If you aren't in college consider vacating after 11pm."}
{"text":"Always a top pick. I always crave something from their menu, everything is delicious. Options for any diet restrictions. Great atmosphere, food, & vibes."}
{"text":"After a tour at the Great Lakes Brewing Company, I was looking for a good place to sit down, grab dinner, and a few more beers on a Friday night. Townhall is the perfect place for all of that. The atmosphere is lively, but not too noisy and the restaurant has indoor seating that flows right into the outdoor space when the weather is nice. 

I ate the lamb burger, which was absolutely delicious. The tzatziki and goat cheese was flavorful and the burger was perfectly cooked. My friend had the poke bowl and he loved it too. 

Most importantly, Townhall has a long and rotating list of craft beers. I must have had three Willoughby Peanut Butter Cup Porters in addition to some IPAs and Amber lagers (it was a long night!). They carry Ohio based breweries, but also carry a wide variety ranging from California to Vermont. 

This restaurant is an absolute must stop if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends and enjoyed the environment as we devoured our chocolate chip cookie skillet and brownie sundaes.

The customer service was superb and friendly. Took good care of us and made sure our drinks weren't ever fully empty for long.

The lighting can be a little awkward when trying to read the menus, but impossible, it is not. I was disappointed by the lack of Belgium beer options. It is my go-to drink, but yet, none were available and I was unsure if they offered anything similar to Blue Moon or Stella. Also, I was expecting a wine glass when I ordered my Chardonnay, but was given a glass without the stand. Something small, but threw me off a little.

All in all, a very enjoyable place to hang out and have fun with friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant's menu was unique. The choices were organic and healthy. I was able to try one of their burgers. So tasty and filling. There are multiple TVs to watch the game on. And there is also a separate menu for beers. Definitely go for their happy hour. The beers are half price. This place gives off a honey bar feel, without too much concern of unhealthy eating."}
{"text":"You have to get past the pretentiousness first...

Then it hits you:  this place actually IS decent.  Tune out the hipsters, the scenesters, and the stupid line out the door and you'll find that this place has just the right mix of trendy/casual that might be borderline approachable.

The tap list is amazing.  I can get beers from places I've lived like MN or MI and draught no less, just like I'm back there.  And this place does try to take mixology at least somewhat seriously.

The food, well, it's all over the place.  Good, but a total hodge podge of global cuisine so you'll be sure to find your flavor.  Start with the guac and finish with Thai noodles.  It's all good.

If you're looking for a place with guarantees atmosphere this is it, any day of the week."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the Cleveland area. I highly recommend! 

FOOD:
They have a large menu with a variety of options to fit anyone's dietary needs (vegan, gluten free, dairy-free or just looking for a healthy and nutritious meal). Their acai bowl is just simply THE BEST I've ever had anywhere and filling enough for an entire meal since they load it with toppings and it's a pretty good size.  Everything I've ordered here is always fresh, not too salty, and super delicious and flavorful! 

SERVICE:
The service here is really good. The last time I was here our waitress was really nice and attentive.  The only kind of annoying thing about this restaurant is it's ALWAYS packed and always at least a 30 min wait to get a table (on the weekends at least). But the good news is you can walk around Ohio city while you wait and there's a lot to see in that area.

ATMOSPHERE:
I love the plant themed decor inside the restaurant and outside as well. They have a gorgeous large patio in the back of the restaurant with plenty of seating and umbrellas for shade. They have multiple wall gardens that are really unique and something you don't see at most restaurants.  If you are really into plants or gardening you will love it here!

PARKING:
There's a large free parking lot directly behind this restaurant. It can be packed sometimes on the weekends but usually you can find someone leaving and park without an issue."}
{"text":"Came here for our first bite in Cleveland and was impressed. There were so many great selections especially for gluten free, vegan friendly, vegan and paleo. The guacamole came with chips and we asked if we can have vegetables and boy was I impressed. There were more than 3 vegetables to dip. The waitress Ashley was great. She was friendly and we didn't have to wait long to be served. 
Loved this place even more because they allow dogs and have a dog menu. Humans and dog were very happy after we ate here."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. They have a great selection of dishes for vegans and non-vegans. On this visit we had the chicken burrito, basil fried rice, green thumb juice and sunrise juice. All was very good and I am extremely picky right down to the water they bring to the table. Water was filter. Service was good and very friendly. The decor is fantastic. It is a classy spot for daytime lunch meetings that easily transitions to a late night hotspot. They have a nice size patio in the back. A fantastic drink selection. Self service water station for filtered, reverse osmosis, and sparkling water. They even sell cigars to enjoy on the patio after 10pm. And a must have in my book to get a full 5 star rating... a clean bathroom."}
{"text":"I just don't like the place.  I keep trying because it's convenient, and even with my low expectations I'm continually disappointed.  After writing this review, I realize that this place is truly the Applebee's of the Ohio City / West 25th neighborhood.  First, it is RIDICULOUSLY noisy ALL the time.  It's not the music, it's the acoustics - it sounds like a constantly clattering henhouse.  Unpleasant.

It's one of those places with a lot of 'rules' - you can't sit here or there if you're ordering only drinks, only food, if you need a server, if you're waiting for someone, if it's a front patio table, if it's a back patio table, if you have a group this size or that size, and so on and so on.  Essentially, it's a damn hassle.  The place is generally crowded so the incomprehensible rules lead to more problems - other patrons trying to sit down at tables that people have been waiting for, or (worse) standing with their asses exactly eye level to tables that have finally been seated for dinner after an hour long wait.

Note that this place is full of children.  Like, infants and toddlers.  They are welcome here and even given balloons.  The milkshakes are served with sparklers.  So if you're looking for a place for a cocktail or dinner at 7pm on a Saturday night, realize that the the kids give this place a distinctly Applebee's feel.  Later in the evening, it gets super trashy.  The lights are turned nearly off, it's a shoulder to shoulder meat market, and you can't make your way to the bathroom without being groped.  It's just a disturbing juxtaposition.  Sparklers in milkshakes, or strangers grinding against you - there's an experience for everyone.

Continuing the Applebee's vibe is the obvious lack of experience and knowledge in most of the servers; you absolutely cannot rely on them for liquor or cocktail recommendations.  I once ordered \"the closest thing you have to a hot toddy\" and the server had no clue what that was.  I explained, and she brought me whisky and a randomly flavored tea bag - along with a drink menu which specifically lists a 'chilled' version of a hot toddy! I asked if I could switch it out, and she said sure, but I would still need to pay for the $9 whisky and tea bag.  I'm not offended by being charged for something that was served to me (even though I didn't touch it), but I was offended by her incompetence and lack of knowledge of the menu.

However, the food isn't bad - the dates are probably the best thing on the menu and are really, really delicious. The bowls are tasty but only average, and same with the flatbreads.  It's worth noting that the chicken I've had here has been somewhat sketchy - randomly diced chicken including fat and tendons.  Kind of what you would expect from a lower rent American-Chinese joint, not this place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! 

-after 5:00pm order the salmon dish, you will not be disappointed! The vegan chili is by far one of their best dishes. I've also recently tried the food truck tacos and I highly recommend. The vegan brownies just may be better than a regular brownie. 

-lastly, the only thing I'm not a fan of is the grilled cheese. The staff is super accommodating especially if you have an issue with your meal."}
{"text":"*This review is for food/dinner only*

Whether you are into organic food, are a vegan or dont care either way, Townhall has a great variety of healthy, tasty options to choose from. I recommend the scallops or one of their delicious bowls! 

TIPS:
If you are trying to beat the dinner crowd, try to arrive before 7 on a weekend. The restaurant fills up pretty quickly. 

If you visit on the weekend, I recommend finishing your meal and departing by 9 or 9:30, unless you intend to participate in the \"club atmosphere.\" The crowd drastically changes around this time. Chairs go up at 10 and a much younger, drinking crowd arrives."}
{"text":"Townhall has amazing food.  There's not one thing on the menu that I've tried that I don't like!! I have had issues in the past with waiting long periods of time to be seated after I was told my table was ready, but it seems like they have been working to make sure those kinds of situations don't happen anymore. Love it here."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the food options.  We came on Vegan night so if you're a Vegan, Monday is your night.  Also Monday had $3.00 drafts from 6p-close so that rocked.  The food portions were big but this place really wasn't my style of food.  I wouldn't eat here all the time but it was ok since the group wanted to go.  There were plenty of beers to pick from, and if you check in on yelp you get a free high five.  It looked cool inside and was different than most places. So I have it four stars for looking cool, good beer selection and seemed to make my entire group happy.  Except my weird tastes in food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place on zero stars just based on the negative vibes and energy I got from this place. Very racist establishment. Was told that a table would be ready at a certain time. ( This happened on two separate occasions by the way). Was told by the hostess when the time came \"a couple more minutes\". But there were white people coming in sitting down without reservations. There was another group of black people who were sitting waiting long before me and my party arrived who explained to me what was going on as well. After the blatant prejudice my party and I left. Will not be back and seriously debating contacting the local news."}
{"text":"Nice bar with decent priced drinks. I only got charged $3.24 for a peach schnapps and pineapple juice drink but not complaining! The truffle fries here are skimpy compared to the ones at bier market"}
{"text":"Frequent visitor of Townhall and have never had a poor experience. This is a great place for either brunch, drinks and dinner too. We take visitors here every time we have guests in town and everyone loves it. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito and the grilled cheese/tomato soup, so yummy!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Yelp event. I'm not supposed to review the business based upon the event so I'm basing it on what we ordered and paid for while there.

I had their Salted Pistachio and Bacon Milkshake. It is outstanding! Rich, creamy and loaded with pistachio flavor, and, a strip of thick sliced bacon! It's a MUST HAVE! I also ordered the Prosciutto Wrapped Dates. So delicious! Hot (temperature, not spicy) and crispy and so full of flavors. Another must have.

It was LOUD in there but that may have been due to the event. Lots of TV screens to keep the bored occupied.

I'm not a beer drinker but my wife sampled a few and found one she liked very much. They have MANY so any beer drinker should find their own special brew.

Definitely a place to return to when in the area, or even for a special event! For me it's over an hour deive but it's still worth it to go."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here on a recommendation from another coworker and we were glad we did! The vibe is great and although we were given a 45 minute wait time, we ended up being seated in about 20 minutes. I ordered the burger and milkshake combo-$12 for a burger and milkshake (I got strawberry). The milkshake comes with a sparkler which was fun :)

Good food and good service. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"We usually take people from out-of-town to Townhall, since they have something for everybody -- healthy fare, juicy burgers, flavorful rice bowls. Definitely a place with a lot going on, but they do it all pretty well. Vegans/vegetarians won't leave hungry. They do emulsive cocktails, freshly ground coffee, fresh juices. I think they even have a cigar menu. I've had dinner here at least a half dozen times, and had their brunch two or three times. The food is always fresh and the beer list is never boring. We always order the prosciutto-wrapped dates, and I can also recommend the flat breads (they are huge) and the burgers. You can't go wrong with brunch, but I absolutely love that they make crepes to order. I've come to enjoy sitting on the cafe side, as the service is still great but the ambiance is usually a little more chill. I've been here later on a weekend night and it gets packed. Not that service was poor; they always have several bartenders, but even then it wasn't exactly easy ordering another beer. If you want to avoid the Ohio City weekend frat boy scene, steer clear of this place on weekend nights."}

{"text":"This place is always busy! 
Their menu has a nice variety of options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat lovers. They also have a coffee and juice bar, as well as a terrific draft beer list. There's something here for everyone!
The servers, bartenders, and hostesses are always friendly. 
Gabrielle was our server when we went on vEgan night, and she was very nice.
We got tofu nuggets and pumpkin seed dip as appetizers, and I had the tuna poke bowl. Everything was healthy and fresh tasting. 
It's a great place to socialize and watch a sports game on tv. It's usually pretty noisy. They accommodate children also. Outside they have high tops and lower bench seating, and it's also a comfortable atmosphere on their patio."}
{"text":"Vegan Mondays!! Husband and I really enjoy this place. Staff is super friendly, drinks are good and I love that the menu caters to several dietary needs/preference."}
{"text":"Love
Love loved the food! Our cashier was awesome (no server on the cafe side that night). Food was outrageously good! I mean the flavor and texture were perfect. I plan to come back soon with my fiancé or on my own."}
{"text":"The nacho plate here is delicious, and I love the outdoor area during the summer. The drinks are good, but if it's really busy at night, it can be difficult to get a drink at the bar. Overall, though it's nice for a night out or a place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Really delicious food for a wide range of dietary requirements. Also, they let you have your dog out on their patio and will bring them a bowl of water. Friendly staff, great atmosphere. I had a great time here"}
{"text":"The meal I ordered (burrito 3.0) wasn't quite what I expected (it had a very sweet sauce) but I was able to speak with the manager who decided to give me a free skillet cookie for dessert! The skillet cookie definitely made up for the dinner that I had and ultimately I really enjoyed the restaurant.  The atmosphere is great and they really want to make you happy when you leave.  Town Hall is definitely worth a visit and is worthy of 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Can be a bit of a yuppie crowd, but that's not their fault. Always been happy with my food, and they have a pretty good beer selection to choose from."}
{"text":"The food and menu options are really clean, healthy and creative! I tried the peanut bowl and it was really tasty. However, the service was not good as we waited longer than expected to be seated and then we waited about a half hour for our check after asking two people."}
{"text":"Townhall is usually the place I think of when I think of Ohio City. I've mainly been to Townhall during the day, but it's also pretty cool at night as well. The only problem with Townhall during busy hours is how crowded the place gets. The place is pretty large, so the business must be booming, but it can be frustrating.

In terms of the restaurant, Townhall has great food and selections of drinks. They have a menu of craft brews that are all over the spectrum. I haven't tried everything on the food menu, but I really liked the burrito 3.0, the street truck tacos, and the fortitude smoothie. 

The back outside patio (which has an entrance/exit) is great in the summer time. There are nice flowers and plants around the area which is a unique atmosphere. The inside can be pretty dark and loud at night, but there are a lot of cool features to look at. I've never seen a table with a potted plant in the middle of it, but I witnessed my first one at Townhall. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone going around the Ohio City area."}
{"text":"We gave Townhall another shot and we were blown away with how well things seem to be going! 
The food tastes fresh and healthy and has options for vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and paleo. The beer list is extensive and color coded by type. I never made it around to trying a cocktail but they sound wonderful!! 
Even when it was crazy busy and packed with people, our waitress was attentive, energetic, and knowledgeable about the menu and beers! 
We had a wonderful time and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Food no doubt is amazing.

As far as the service, the further down the bar you sit towards the out door seating the better chances you have of getting piss poor service.  Luckily this was my second time there so I know what the service should be.

If it was my first impression I wouldn't have come back."}
{"text":"The food is cool minus the fries. Had a juice once it was just okay but they do have a really good vegan burger. The atmosphere isn't welcoming if you are the shade of a brown paper bag and darker. On multiple occasions received terrible services, even when it's empty."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. It has become my new favorite when recouping from trips through the market. The sweet potato pancakes are awesome, but everything that I've order has been great. Pair that with friendly and quick service and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food! This place has a fun and festive vibe that makes it perfect for a night on the town. It is crowded, so we put our names in early and had a beer at a nearby bar- they text us when the table was ready. I was the only vegan in the group & there were many delicious choices for me throughout the menu. I would rate this as one of the best vegan friendly restaurants I've ever been to! If you're in the area, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"2 star night. 2nd time I been here on Saturday night. Opened tab at bar 5....and spent 25 minutes to get my 2nd drink. This is after our party bus ordered a round for us. I know it's not personal but maybe if blonde bartender focused on filling orders like she focused on getting shots from patron I would have been served sooner. So yeah I tipped $6 on my $5 beer and told my original bartender...yall missed the mark tonight. To her credit...she offered me a drink on her. I politely declined and said...thanks but the point is...I know yall are busy...but ur coworkers ignoring me while I'm standing like errrrbody else...not cool. I'm probably good at Townhall for a bit. Still love and support local business...but not the experience I was hoping for. In to the next."}
{"text":"Great food and vibe, excellent staff. And the best darn deep dish chocolate chip cookie evvvveeeer!"}
{"text":"this place puts a smile on my face everytime I'm in there. their food always comes out so fast you think they have made a mistake. their coffee is local and free trade and that really appeals to a fellow barista like me. I have tried almost every item they have to offer on the menu and I have never been let down. their beer selection is out of this world as well as the staff, always a beautiful smiling face taking my order at the table, behind the bar and at there awesome cafe! I love this place and hope everyone's experience is as wonderful as mine."}
{"text":"After being here twice--once for evening drinks and nibbles and once for brunch--I can confirm what a few other reviewers have mentioned: the vibe really changes depending on when you're at Town Hall. That said, both experiences have been great. 

Food: delicious. The prosciutto wrapped dates are worth a trip on their own. But more on the dinner later. My brunch meal was stupendous. I decided to splurge and got the grilled cheese and tomato soup as well as a crepe. The grilled cheese was good-I added prosciutto and avocado and it definitely added to the sandwich-but the soup was a star. A very thick, creamy soup with croutons and delicious surprises of goat cheese. I didn't want to stop eating it! Considering how much savory I had had, I went for a dessert crepe: Nutella, peanut butter, and almonds topped with whipped cream and berries. Tasty, but I would say there was too much of each topping. (Too pretentious if I say I've eaten crepes in France?) A thin layer of each is all that is needed and this was globbed and oozing everywhere. The crepe wasn't bad--just too much. Next time I'll go savory and control how much is added. My companion had the Thai rice bowl which had an AMAZING peanut sauce as well as nicely steamed veggies. Bit more rice than necessary (by the time you got to the bottom you were out of sauce and veggies so just plain rice), but tasty and a generous portion. For dinner/nibbles, I sampled a lot of things. Their bar mix has great and meh components, but the flatbreads are good and YOU NEED TO COME HERE JUST FOR THE PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED DATES. 

Drinks: lots of beer options. A little heavy on the hoppy/IPA side in my humble opinion, but I still found some tasty dark beers to enjoy. The juice bar is also quite good and you can customize the juices somewhat. Companion was torn between two juices because he wanted the apple juice from one but liked the overall ingredients of the other better, so they just let him add apple juice. We weren't charged for the change either, which was nice. 

Service: hit or miss. The brunch staff, particularly the waitress, were great. They sat us quickly and responded well to our requests (TV, quieter corner) and the waitress was out of this world. Friendly, very knowledgeable, a good sport, and totally understood the free high five. When I came for dinner/nibbles, it was a split. A few were very knowledgeable about the beer and food while some of the others were very obviously in training. In both cases I have one complaint: water glasses were not refilled often enough. Protip for brunch: the crepe guy has a tip jar, so bring up a few bills when you go to place your order. 

Overall, I probably would give Town Hall 4.5 stars but it didn't blow me away enough for me to round up to a 5.

I definitely be back, but I'll probably avoid late nights since the evening was already a bit crowded for me. I'll just brunch here!"}
{"text":"Super fun spot. Was busier than I expected at 2:30pm on a Saturday (but maybe that says more about my expectations?).  A very cool beer selection; i wasn't very much in a beer mood so i appreciated that there were so many non-traditional brews on offer, including some sours and ciders. Loved loved the Thai peanut bowl, definitely recommend it. Also lots of other healthy options on the menu!"}
{"text":"It's great to have another place to go to for vegetarians and vegans where there are more options than salads and veggie burgers."}
{"text":"Town Hall has amazing Booody Marys .
Really.zg
We were directed here by someone we met the day before and were told to try the Marys...best I'd had in a long while.
I had a delicious kale and beat w goat cheese salad that was divine..and HUGE.
The vibe is low key and the food is really good."}
{"text":"A restaurant focused just as much on the quality of their food as the taste of their food. Their belief in creating a non-GMO menu is groundbreaking in Cleveland. But that belief doesn't hold them back from having incredibly tasty food. 

In addition to their amazing beer list - they have different menus for different dietary needs (They have a vegan menu night and a Paleo night). The menu is seasonal so some of the items change, but there are some staples that are a must-try. 

PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED DATES (Insert jaw dropped emoji). I was hesitant at first due to not being a huge fan of dates - but after a group of friends shared them, I am HOOKED. 

I love burgers! 100% honest - Townhall's grass-fed Koke Beef Cheeseburger is the best burger in Cleveland. The white cheddar with the rosemary aioli is unbelievable. Served with truffle fries that make me want to run circles around the restaurant. 

Another favorite is the Grilled Cheese Bars & Tomato Bisque soup. The Grilled cheese has thick slices of tomatoes and The soup has a dollop of goat cheese (I think) that makes it even creamier. Perfect for lunch.

But the thing that keeps me coming back every weekend is their brunch. Served from 9AM - 2:30PM on Saturday and Sunday - it's some of the best breakfast/brunch food you can get. 
Each weekend they have a build your own crepe table with both savory and sweet options. This is a ton of fun for kids. 
My favorite things to order is The Southern Comfort. Two biscuits smothered in thick peppery sausage gravy with a poached egg on top, served with perfectly cooked rosemary potatoes (I really hope your mouth is watering right now). YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS!

If you're in Cleveland this is a must try. Fun atmosphere and great service add to their amazing food and incredible drink menu."}
{"text":"Spotty service and food at best. The frat crowd doesn't help matters. There are many choices in Ohio City for great food, this just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Sometimes ambiance really adds to one's enjoyment of a place. Sure, you can get the BEST TACOS EVER at some dive that smells like wet socks, but isn't the point of going out for drinks/dinner to get a little somethin' that you can't get at home? I mean, I can get that wet sock smell at home while eating cold canned ravioli.

Aaaaanyway, the ambiance of Town Hall is fantastic. A few family members from out of town suggested this place (mainly due to their large vegan selection), and I ended up being crazy happy about the choice. Sure, the beautiful Friday afternoon in bustling Ohio City added a ton to my positive feelings about this place. Would I have still loved my burger and beer if I had been here during a Polar Vortex? Sure, but a lovely summer day on the patio added so much to the experience. 

But everybody in our (somewhat picky) group, from grandma to grandchild, loved their meals. And the service was great. I will definitely be back, probably so I can drink good beer at the long-ass bar without my family thinking I'm an alcoholic."}
{"text":"Townhall is placed perfectly in Ohio City- only a couple doors down from the West Side Market. I love places like this because they prove that Cleveland is coming back. 
With that being said, the food is fabulous. Not your ordinary fare, for Townhall incorporates the trendy habits of a food truck with the establishment of a well-maintained restaurant. 
I had the Vigor Smoothie (only because I had my wisdom teeth out the day before), and I was more than satisfied! 
The service is incredible and so friendly again proving #CLERocks!"}
{"text":"This almost seems like a hidden gem, although maybe not too hidden bc it was quite busy on Valentines Day. My husband and I went here for a drink and an app while waiting for Lolita happy hour and I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. We sat in the cafe area and there was barely anyone there and it was so relaxing and great view of the street. 

We ended up getting 2 things to split, the food truck tacos and the Bibb lettuce wraps and both were packed with flavor. The tacos might have been my favorite, with the homemade shells and the crunch of the slaw inside, fantastic. The Bibb lettuce wraps were also delicious and also a little different. It was served with 3 different sauces which were all very tasty and grilled chicken, ginger carrots and a few other veggies. Everything was so fresh tasting and the different flavors that you could combine in that Bibb lettuce I promise will surprise you. 

This was a fantastic place to stop, great prices and I even look forward to going here for a whole dinner."}
{"text":"Didnt even check in here cuz I was embarrassed.  Work folk wanted to walk down here and I was 3 Lake Erie Monsters in and I would of agreed to an anal bleaching in an alley by that point.  Youtube the episode of \"Rich Dicks\" on the Kroll show and it sums up this place.   This is the new Cleveland that sucks.  Plaid shirts, valet parking and chicklet white teeth.  Everybody here is an overnight foodie and a craft beer guru.  Alton Brown should run for mayor of W. 25th St at this stage.  Pliney the Elder battered tater tots in foie gras im sure will be soon to follow. ..

\"You're blind, baby! You're blind from the facts\"--Flavor Flav"}
{"text":"Great place with healthy options!  Defiantly wish we had a place like this back in Iowa!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but I had to register on yelp to write this review and felt so compelled in order to do so. I heard the food was great and wanted to check it out, so we called to try and make reservations and were told that they didn't accept them. Fast forward to arriving for dinner and being told that multiple parties who had reservations were in front of us (strike 1). Okay, no problems, we will grab a beer at the bar. We go to grab a beer and the bartender throws a menu at us and we look, decide and order after which she tells us no, we don't have that, we only carry American beers. After pointing out the Belgian beer on the menu, to them, the bartender says oh, so sorry, we change so often I forget (strike two). One hour and a half later, we are still waiting for a table and the hostess tells us another hour, you should have another beer (we were originally quoted one hour, are you comping this beer? No thanks, strike three)

Never again."}
{"text":"The menu has quite a bit of variation and the ingredients used are fresh, which I appreciate. My date is very particular about juices and verified that all the juice drinks are made fresh and are not from concentrate. Our server was a little overbearing at first and was difficult to flag down at the end, so I guess that part of the experience averages out to \"okay\"? My understanding is that they are still in the hiring process, and it was really crowded when we were there. Although it was just an ok experience, I'm interested in checking the place out again, perhaps once it is more settled."}
{"text":"Visited cleveland for the first time this past weekend with my bf and this was by far the best meal we had while visiting. Also the healthiest! We started with the loaded sweet potato skins which were so unique and one of the best appetizers ive ever had. Then, i had an amazing zucchini noodle bowl with spicy shrimp, mint, radishes, avocado, apple, etc. My boyfriend had the carnitas street tacos with truffle fries. Everything was amazing. Our waitress was great and super informative. The numerous beer choices were also awesome and the two beers we tried were each $5 - such a great deal. Would definitely make this out first stop next time we're in cleveland."}
{"text":"We went to Townhall for brunch on Saturday around 12. It was absolutely packed and we had to wait around 45 minutes, but luckily we went to the bar and got some amazing bloody Mary's. 

We finally got a table and I ordered the West 25th Burrito, and it was really good. I didn't know before I went but most of the food is local and organic, which is definitely a huge plus. We ordered another Bloody Mary, and I got the Absolut cilantro vodka in it this time, and it was a lot better than the regular bloody Mary's. 

I can't wait to go back and try some more stuff, hopefully next time it's not as crowded!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Staff, and Great Patio! My favorite place to dine and drink in Ohio City. Never disappointed with the quality of food or service. Would definitely recommend to both friends and family; especially those who do not frequent downtown or Ohio City."}
{"text":"One of my go to places when coming to an event downtown.  The food is delicious and decently priced.  Service is always prompt and attentive.  Solid beer selection as well!

Tip: celebrate a birthday here and you get a free skillet cookie with ice cream and a huge sparkling candle!"}
{"text":"-  Great outside seating
-  Very dog friendly - they even had a menu for our dog!  we live in SF, and I've never seen that before!
-  Great menu selection - something for everyone!
-  Impressive beer and smoothie menu
-  Great service - we were seated quickly and the waitress was so accommodating and our food came quickly!"}
{"text":"I feel like when you walk in this place there should be a disclaimer that they do not serve 'normal' food.  We got in, sat down ordered drinks and opened the menu to find that everything was gluten free, vegan and no 'normal' choices on the menu.  The place had a good atmosphere, but it ended there.  I got chicken nachos without the vegan chili and for $13 it was small and not very good, plus they didn't hold the chili as requested.  My opinion: unless you want gluten free vegan food, steer clear, there are plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"To set the scene, it was another nice June summer day. The wind was blowing, the trees were shaking, and the pizza was cooking. Oh wait. They don't have pizza... they only have flatbread. Great! (Sarcasm) as we stepped through the non gmo door we realized we walked around a circle. The garage was open so we could have just walked right in, but there was no door man to help is figure how to not look idiots. Sad.. As we walked through the entrance we couldn't help to notice that there was no server/host to escort us to our friends. Disappointed. Finally we all decide to go outside and sit (keep in mind this was our friends 22nd birthday, EVERYONE knew) and a server walked past our table with a birthday cake to the people behind us.. We left feeling uneasy. Shaken, disturbed, and a little gassy. It was probably the flatbread. Overall great place and looking  to head their on Mondays for their drink special!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, no GMO food!!! Amazing service. Great music, even during lunch! Free parking in the back. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Brunch was really good, except for the long wait and the server who admitted that she was hungover/drunk. I order huevos rancheros and it was good. The only complaint that I have is that people kept bumping into me."}
{"text":"I've only hit up Townhall 2x since moving to Cleveland, which was just recently. Once was after a night of boozing at Marketing Garden Brewery. We stopped in and bought flatbread and beers, which was divine. The second time was just recently with a friend I met. I got the curry noodles and a beer. Neither visit disappointed. 

It's such a happening place. I have yet to sit outside in the patio area, but the vibe inside is great. The food is delicious and the beers hit the spot. It's not super crazy loud (or hasn't been the last 2 times I've gone) so it makes conversation easy. The help is informative and quick. 

My next trip will be on their vegan day. I love their menu options and I want to try it all!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to bring friends or family when they come to town to visit, and I want to take them somewhere in my neighborhood. The staff is always friendly, knowledgeable about the food and drinks and are time efficient in their service. I've never had to wait for a table, just how I like it. I usually sit at the bar or patio (weather permitting). The stools are comfy, and ladies don't forget to use the purse hooks under the bar! I Love that feature. 

The beer list is huge, eclectic and changes seasonally. It's fun to try the different kinds and the staff always makes good suggestions and give samples. The food menu ranges from meat eaters to vegan so everyone can find something they will like. The ingredients have always been fresh and the food good. The 100% grass fed burger with truffle fries is my favorite."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I loved the food at Townhall so much that after eating here for dinner, I returned the next day for lunch. Everything I had tasted super fresh and healthy, and the prices were amazingly reasonable. I'm from Manhattan and have unfortunately become accustomed to astronomical restaurant pricing, so Townhall was a welcome and delicious departure from that.

I ordered the zucchini noodle primavera bowl. Perfect size, very flavorful, and only $10-don't know how that's possible. I also ordered the skillet cookie ($6). While it was definitely supposed to serve more than one person, I was dining alone and had read such great reviews about it that I had to try it. It came out warm with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and was well worth the calories. I polished it off in a few minutes. 

I originally entered into the restaurant side of Townhall, but the wait was about 30 minutes so I went over to the café. The menu is the same, but you go up to the counter to order and seat yourself. The food is then brought to your table. I would have preferred to sit in the restaurant, but didn't want to wait 30 minutes. I think it's awesome that they were that busy on a Monday night. 

My only complaint was with the way my food was brought out. When I ordered, I asked for the cookie skillet dessert to be brought out after my meal so I could enjoy my entrée. Because you go up to order at the counter and I wanted everything on one check rather than having to go up and order again, I had to order them both at once. I was really disappointed when the cookie came out less than five minutes after my entrée, because I wanted to eat the dessert while it was warm. I ended up scarfing down the zucchini noodle primavera bowl to ensure that I was able to get to the cookie before the ice cream completely melted. Annoying, but not annoying enough to not return the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm really liking this place.
I was impressed by their commitment to NON-GMO products. 
The room had an open concept decor and seating was sometimes family styled. The room was delightfully boisterous and my waitress Alex was a joy.
The place is a restaurant/bar type establishment complete with table service, and they also have a cafe where you can order your food pat the register and they bring it out to your table or you can take it to go. 
The food was really interesting and tasty and they had a huge selection of beers and other libations (smoothies, unique cocktails, tonics, etc) and the menu, while unpredictable, never felt like they were serving dishes that were completely foreign to my palate. 
They even sell cigars there (apparently they having a smoking area on the back patio)
Seems like a very popular spot and it's easy to understand why. 
If you're in Cleveland, I'd suggest you go check it out. Something there is bound to appeal to you. 
It certainly charmed the pants offa me."}
{"text":"Still a fan! Townhall has continued to refine its vegan menu and the items keep getting better and better! My current fave is the Power 3.0 salad (veganized) - kale, quinoa, apple slices, roasted beets, and almonds - yum! I add tofu to the salad for additional protein, too. 

Vegan milkshakes are now available, and they're made with Mitchell's vegan ice cream. 

The only bad thing about Townhall is that I live too far away!"}
{"text":"We came in with a party of six. Told it was a 45 min wait, but ended up being only 15. That's a plus. Our server was friendly and made recommendations that I took her up on... Crispy Wrapped Dates and Spicy Curry Chicken Noodles. Delicious! 
The negative that dropped this from 4 stars to 3? The bathroom. Out of paper towels and trash strewn on the floors. Plus a server hanging out in there and texting... Taking up pace in a narrow area. She didn't even offer to move out of the way.  
This would not deter my returning or recommending this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We just went for breakfast with my mom and step dad from out of town and couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on weekends,cheep drinks and good burgers."}
{"text":"Good food. Good beer selection. Nice interior and nice patio seating. My only gripe, don't order the fries unless you enjoy eating a bucket of grease."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food and drink selection. I was in town visiting from New Hampshire and was very impressed. I had the kefta lamb burger and it was killer. Perfectly cook. The goat cheese spread complimented the burger perfectly.   For you locals that haven't tried this place do it!!  For any out of towners do yourself a favor and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Everything was GOOD!!!!!  I had the Be Well hot tea (Tisane) and the Wakey Wakey breakfast!  Very Nice Town Hall, Very Nice!!!! Beautiful place too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great for families- for once my kids sat and ate! My husband and I were able to enjoy craft beer without hearing them complain! Great food!"}
{"text":"Townhall is one of those places that people either love or loathe. Somehow, depending on the day, I find myself at both ends of the spectrum.

Sometimes I think Townhall's downfall is a product of it's own success- it's too popular. The \"it's so packed a Saturday 3 pm lunch is over an hour wait\" popular. Walking into happy hour means you spend the first 20 minutes scavenging the bar like a turkey vulture waiting for someone to leave and/or die. Want a drink at night? Which couple are you going to squeeze between for 20 minutes before a bartender has time for you? Late night brings out the supreme douchelord crowd that's probably engaged but is going to hit on you anyway because their fiance is in Boston type people.  Do you see where I'm going?

On the flip side, it's super trendy and full of cool healthy options and a plethora of beers on a rotating color-coded tap list. It's well thought out. They have non-GMO grass-fed crunchy stuff that makes me super happy and wish I ate here more (see previous paragraph on why I don't). You can tell they put a lot of effort into what they do and I appreciate that. It's somewhere everyone on the west side of Cleveland has probably been. The back patio is actually great in the summer and you don't really feel like you're sitting in a parking lot. 

One other thing that drives me crazy is the lack of information- specifically on their happy hour. Apparently they have one because the menu lists which beers are happy hour eligible but no where on the menu or website does it list what days/time/price happy hour is and if there are food selections as well. The last time I was there was a Thursday afternoon and no one bothered to tell me so who knows. Other than that I like most things about Townhall- just not the type of crowd this place pulls on weekend nights(which isn't their fault)."}
{"text":"Place really lived up to the hype. Went there for lunch with some  coworkers. I had the Thai Peanut Bowl which was very good and the green iced tea also very good.  Atmosphere is top notch and hip. Will definitely  go back again.  If my experience is the same this place may get the 5th star.  I never give that rating after just one visit."}
{"text":"Townhall really tries. It's a cool atmosphere, it has great burgers, but it's really trying to be something it's not. The multi-ethnic cuisines on the menu fall flat. The wine is rather poor, and the offering of fresh juice seems out of place in the march of beer and ale taps. Townhall needs to accept what it's good at--burgers, beer, and snacks--and work to make those great."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday and it was great. We sampled a couple appetizers, one of the flatbreads and the burger. All were delicious. It was quite busy at our reservation time (6:30pm on a Thursday) so I'd suggest making a reservation if you're going during normal dining hours. Bonus tip: If you sign up for their mailing list  on their website - you can get a coupon for a free appetizer and goodies on your birthday. Will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. Amazing food and wonderful, really nice people who work there. Service was a little slow but it was around the dinner rush that we went. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The set up of Townhall is a bit confusing. I wasn't sure where to sit since it was just me, but I wasn't sure where to order or if I was going to be served by waitstaff. Anyways, I sat on the \"cafe\" side. I ordered at the register, but sat around the empty bar area in the cafe side. Still - wtf was going on in this place?
I decided to order the Acai Refresher Soda to drink and for food, I ordered the Grilled Cheese + Soup. I went with the Vegan Chili for my soup.
The Acai Refresher was well... refreshing. 
The Grilled Cheese was yummy. I loved the added arugula and roasted tomatoes. 
The Vegan Chili was tasty! Nice and chunky, but not too much. I wish it was a bit spicier.
It was a quick lunch for me, so I was in & out, but it seems like Townhall is a hang out spot for most."}
{"text":"Really fantastic menu, not to mention how \"lifestyle diet\" friendly it is!  Paleo, vegetarian, and vegan options are all available.  Rumour on the street is that they are/soon will be GMO free.  The only negative I have is that it's difficult to get seated sometimes, but it's a great establishment so expect a bit of a wait.  Thet patio is awesome and bring you can bring your dog!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Delicious food. Loved the appetizer dates wrapped in bacon with a balsamic reduction.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Their food is THE BOMB. Drinks are meh (and expensive for what you get), but their food - THE BOMB. Fresh & delicious. Their burgers are excellent, along with their nachos."}
{"text":"Food: The prosciutto wrapped dates were good, everything else was aggressively mediocre. Bland steak in a salad drenched in oily dressing & one of the most flavorless burgers in all the land. Reminds me of nicely designed restaurants in high-end hotels that charge a premium for tasteless food. Watered down drinks, too. 

Atmosphere: The building is nice, so there's that. But the clientele is also... well, there's no kind way to put this: Townhall attracts douchebags en masse. For instance, I had the joy of watching a jerk on the patio on his cell phone tell a person who wandered in to ask for bus fare to \"get the f*** away from me.\" On Mother's Day, no less! Should a drifter have been in a patio for paying customers? Probably not. But there are ways to handle it without treating a human being like that.

Overall, the business model certainly is sound: Put attractive waitresses in a nicely appointed building and soak up the douchebag cash. But the food sucks and the clientele are absolutely insufferable. Way too many nice restaurants and bars in Ohio City to be worth the time."}
{"text":"Best new bar in Ohio City! I've been here quite a few times and never had a bad experience. They have a great craft beer selection and the food is on point!"}
{"text":"Since starting with a WFPB lifestyle, I have been super eager to get back to Townhall and order their vegan chili. I've had it on the nachos before, but really wanted to eat it alone as a soup. SO GREAT- a tad spicy, but not too much so. I thought the bean burger was so-so, more soggy than anything else, though the flavor was good (it just didn't have enough body). The drinks continue to blow me away--- I love the constant improvements made by the whimsical drink makers. Sophisticated swill = 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for less than 24 hours and was looking for a perfect Sunday Funday location to meet up with friends.  This location was centrally located near everyone, family friendly and had a wonderful outdoor seating!  I got the burger which I asked to be cooked medium well and it was rare....like the inside was seeping blood and wasn't even warm.  It scared me to eat.  I also got the nachos as appetizers and I wasn't that impressed as well.  It seemed like they were trying to be so trendy and cool, I mean that menu is INTENSE....but what came out of the kitchen didn't really hit the mark. What was impressive was the service, we had 15 Plus people.  They sat us in 15 minutes or less and when we outgrew our table because people kept showing up they moved us to a larger location.  The server (I think her name was Katie) was amazing and was always on point! I'm not sure how she kept our orders together especially since we were moving seats and eventually changed tables, but she did! It was wonderful to focus on friendships and catching up and not on the logistics of bills and peoples orders! I would give the service and venue a 5 and the food a 2 which is why I ended at 3."}
{"text":"Awesome bar! Great staff and atmosphere! Go see Dan I. and grab a kraken on the rocks! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here but the atmosphere was great. Lots of drink options, great people watching place. They have an indoor area with multiple bars and also a terrace outside which was cool. They serve food but we didn't try it."}
{"text":"So this review is more about the individual service we had and not the overall experience. 

My husband and I have been to townhall plenty of times and I'm surprised I haven't written a wonderful review until today, but after the awful service I had this morning at another establishment it compelled me to brag about the bartender that helped us Sunday. 

At brunch I've never had such prompt service even with the bar being so packed, Kendra gave us menus and waters immediately, cleaned up in front of us(even came around to wipe since she couldn't reach) all whilst more people sat and more people yelled for things, she stayed composed, smiled, and helped everyone. We will definitely of course be back, but looking forward to seeing her again, thank you for your lovely service we enjoyed chatting with you in between all of your hard work, some of the best service I've ever had, (and I'm old) ."}
{"text":"Preposterously thundering in the wee hours of Sunday a.m. with Hip club ditties of now and then, and always at full capacity, Townhall intimidates by sheer virtue of its scope and raucous (if urbane/crafty-industrial) tone, and yet, make no mistake dear hungover solace-seekers: these brunch aficionados know their craft inside and out, and they serve with skill and zeal. The legion of servers appear taciturn but generous, armed with tablets for quick order-punching, and thus strike the primo juxtaposition of empathetic to those of us still mired in wine-loud fever dreams, and yet dutiful to the Herculean task of holding court against the masses at large (which are, let's be real, intent often enough on swallowing everything in sight). The brunch menu, if not enormous, succeeds in variety. Many items can be fixed up vegan and/or veg-friendly, a most welcome feature--try the stalwart organic Eggs Benedict with smooth ripe avocado subbed for bacon or the 25th Street Burrito (a serviceable third pounder with smoky cheese and a ghost of chili spice). And, yes, Boozehounds seeking witty signs rejoice: cocktails with flouncy, clunky, if intertextually endearing monickers prevail: the \"Why's the Carpet All Wet, Todd?\" acting as de facto winner of the obscurest reference to everyone's favorite x-mas movie devoid of an electrical appendage contest. Elsewhere, I sing the twee beauty of the lil' juices--one must absolutely indulge in the power green, a minuscule marvel, yet delighting with its savage/springy ginger heaven flavor: served in a botanist's oblong jar, it's also pretty pleasant on the peepers. In fact, its rather a synecdoche for TH, it might be said: creative in vision, and bodily-cleansing, served with care and dignity in a semi-incongruous atmosphere of rich wood grain, sharp angles, and a relentlessly upbeat soundtrack. The history of brunch is the history of carbs and booze and crowds and coffee: Townhall is a quintessential era-definer, an index of that history in microcosm. Worth a look and then some."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Cleveland. A place that is ideal for any occasion: brunch, out on the town on a summer night, watching a sports game, watching the Cavs WIN THE NBA FINALS, pregaming Browns games, nice dinner with friends or professionals, etc. Townhall has served me well in the 3 years I've lived in Cleveland and been one of the highlights.

Most importantly, there's the food. Menu has delicious options to please anyone: even the gluten-free, non-GMO vegan you contemplate not inviting anywhere. It's much more progressive than most restaurants in Cleveland. Good ingredients make a good meal. Even something as simple as the Classico Flatbread (essentially a margarita pizza) impressed me with the blend of quality tomatoes and provolone--this isn't your acidic, greasy pizza, but a dish.

Then there's the drinks. Possibly the best beer list in Cleveland, well-organized and color-coded to direct one through its robust offerings. A diversity of offerings with a few rarer options. Other than the obscurities, all $5. So if you're over tasteless light beers (as you should be), it's the place to go. It's easy to overlook their mixed drinks, but they're all solid as well. For summertime refreshment, I recommend the Perk U Later and then switching to beers.

Did I mention that for Browns games, your strategy should be to go to Townhall and then take their free shuttle to the game/tailgate?

Ambience: one of the best parts of Cleveland is summer nights on either their front or back outdoor seating. Even if you're indoors, it's not stuffy and you feel like you're outside as there's always good ventilation from the cross-breeze. Also, there are plenty TVs. I was particularly impressed this evening as it was the epic Game 7 of the NBA Finals, which, let's be real, no one was really expecting to happen a week ago. Yet Townhall pulled it off rather flawlessly. The service was much better than most places in Cleveland on a regular night. There were confetti rockets and free t-shirts, multiple TVs within eyesight. Clearly a place that is managed well.

I can honestly say that every staff member I've interacted with has been helpful in some way, even though I know the menu and drinks very well. As the beer menu evolves, everyone continues to be able to make recommendations even to an aficionado. And from the guy who clears off the glasses to the waitress/waiter who's taking your order, they're all happy and enjoy what they do. The last 3 times I've been there, I've been taken care of by Katie (?), who was excellent with beer recommendations; Cale, who changed my life by recommending I add some of his sriracha to the thai peanut bowl; Krystal, who wisely pointed me to the spicy curry chicken noodles bowl; and Melody, who did an admirable job during Game 7 tonight.

I think a lot of the credit goes to the management for hiring hard-working, friendly, competent staff who are all invested in the overall concept: healthy, tasty ingredients to create unique dishes and drinks. Moreover, they always seem to pitch in to help out staff when it is busy, while checking in with patrons to make sure they are having the best possible experience; for a place this size, it'd be easy for the management to be detached from the experience of patrons, but they are an integral part of it. I suspect that the management is one of the key reasons Townhall continues to gain in popularity and reputation, despite the inherent challenges of being such a versatile establishment in a city that lacks access to organic food.

In summary: I'll miss Townhall when I move from Cleveland in a couple weeks! Check it out for any occasion, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE place to eat in Cleveland! Healthy, affordable food for everyone. The drinks rock, and the chill atmosphere is a rare find in some other Cleveland neighborhoods. I went for my birthday and the guys at a nearby cabana had brought their puppy. The cute pup was allowed to roam around in the back and play with everyone, which made the meal even better. 

I would highly recommend veganized version of the nachos! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Cleveland, I went to dinner at Townhall on Monday night to enjoy their vegan menu. Our group was only four people, so I was unable to make a reservation because they only take reservations during the week for parties of five or larger. When we walked in through the back patio, every single table had a reservation sign on it. Many of the tables inside did too, but they were still able to seat us right away. We arrived around 5:30pm, and by the time we left, every single table in the restaurant was full.

They have a list of 30 draft beers that the server said changes daily. Their drafts are only $3 after 6pm, so I couldn't resist trying one of their unique selections. Even though though they offer a special vegan menu, all of their regular menu items are available too. For my meal, I went with the Townhall veggie burger with cheese and a side of fries.Veggie burgers can be really hit or miss, but this one was definitely a huge hit! I think black beans and beets make for the perfect combination in a veggie burger.

I am definitely a fan of Townhall and will be back on future visits to Cleveland! It's so nice to see Ohio City has a such great offerings of bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"We came to this place upon recommendation from our taxi driver.  He told us that more people come to West 25th on Fridays but Saturdays are busy everywhere.  He recommended TownHall for the crowd.  

When he dropped us off it didn't look like anything special as no one was outside and it was hard to see through the bar windows.  Once we walked in we were hit with a wall of people in their mid 20's.  This was my first bar experience in Cleveland and it was not what I was expecting.  

This place was really busy and there were groups on top of groups of people out with their friends.  The cab driver commented on how the people here were good looking and my friends agreed with his statements.  It wasn't hipster, it wasn't clubby, it wasn't snobby, just regular people out for a night.  

TownHall was very busy with lots of tables and booths for seating with your parties.  They also have bar stations set up close to the DJ as well as waitresses walking around to serve you.  We had some coke and whiskey as well as some fireball shots and it didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Yay!! I can finally review this place based off of food and not only their bar night life. I am pleasantly surprised about their Monday night vegan offerings. I am personally not vegan, but my friend was visiting from out of town and she is. 

What I did notice is that many of their Monday night vegan offerings are actually on their regular menu, so if you missed Monday you're not exactly out of luck. The vegan milkshake was superb, but I did find that it had a bit of an aftertaste I did not like. But then again, so do a lot of alternate type of foods. My friend also loooooooved the jack fruit \"pulled chicken\". 

Like I said, I eat meat. So of course I ordered the Korean BBQ flatbread. UHHHHHHMMM. SO. GOOD. I ate the whole thing, no regrets. I would be willing to return to definitely try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy/hip place to eat? Townhall is the place to go!

From drinks, to brunch, to burgers, to vegan, Townhall has it all. This place gets busy starting as soon as it opens for brunch, and stays busy all the way until it closes at 2am. Its a great place to hang out and catch up with friends during the day, or go out at night. 

Townhall is where a lot of celebs go when they come into Cleveland- hello Kardashians! 

My FAVORITE thing on the menu are their chicken nachos. I HIGHLY recommend, and they can't be that bad for you when made with natural & local ingredients, right? ;)"}
{"text":"I flew into Cleveland on a Saturday evening and showed up at this restaurant hoping to get a bite to eat.  There are a few things you should be aware of.  I was expecting a somewhat humble vegan-fare hippie-ish establishment, perhaps a bit slow, even on a Saturday eve. Let me tell you that is not what I got.  This is one of the hottest places in town on weekend nights apparently.  Tons of young people, many who were having a great time; it was incredibly loud.   No hippies to be found.  I managed to somehow score a single seat at the bar and ordered some food and a drink.  The food took over an hour to arrive.  I saw people who ordered after me receive their food before me, so perhaps some kind of kitchen mix-up.  I ordered some kind of asian noodle bowl that was short on noodles and long on sauce and onions.  Wouldn't order again.  There was chicken involved, but it had an odd consistency or perhaps just hadn't been trimmed before cooking.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"Foodie Cleveland strikes again. I've now been to Town Hall numerous times and it's taken me this long to review just because it's so hard for me to put into words how amazing this place is. It truly rocks my socks. 

Sadly I can not review their dinner food, as I've only ever made it to brunch here. Quick tip: this is icing on the cake if you stop in before or after a trip to West Side Market. My favorite drink is the Green Thumb which just makes me feel healthy and refreshed after drinking. While their vegetarian gluten free choices are lacking, they are super at accommodating dietary restrictions which always deserves a good star in my book. 

Besides the food and amazing beer selection (again based off of friend choices since there is only one gluten free beer selection) an added bonus is that on Saturday and Sunday brunch days Misha dog is welcome on the patio. If you also have a dog who likes to be included in EVERYTHING than Town Hall brunch is just the place for you."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great, but I will score it 4 stars at this point as it is opening and working out a few of the kinks.  The beer selection is great, but the show stealer is the $3 whiskey options.

The food is an interesting addition to what surrounds the area and welcomed.  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup is simple and good.  I also tried some of the Classico pizza and thought it was a bit short on flavor, but okay.

A couple of thoughts...it is a bit confusing what to expect as you enter through the garage doors compared to the hostess table or thirdly through the café side as to how to get service.

With all of this being said, they did a great job of getting this place together (albeit it took a long time) and it is a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"This dinning experience was awesome. Come as you are and get ready for some flavorful, culinary delights.  Friendly staff and their recommendations were honest and insightful.  The new nachos were excellent and easy to share with the group without a huge mess. The music was spot on and kept the energy flowing - not too loud for easy conversation.  Healthy items to choose from on the menu and many drink options beyond the extensive beer and full bar.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the healthy and paleo small plates. Plus they had some great beers. I could do without the tvs, but that's just my preference. Whoever does the hiring has a real eye for talent."}
{"text":"Spent the afternoon here today and not only do they have amazing food, but also a chic decor and welcoming ambience.  The back patio is fantastic!  The orange pillows on the wooden couches is a great feature.  The bacon wrapped dates are okay.  The lamb burger in insanely good!  The Korean BBQ pizza is also filling and delicious.  The service is also great.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Food allergies/restrictions? No problem!! All staff is ridiculously knowledgeable!!! Food is delicious AND healthy..... what!?!? Seriously, true!!!! Kate G rocks!!! So friendly, knows the menu, if there's sugar in something, great recommendations. She will NOT steer u wrong!!!! Try a cold pressed cocktail ... don't miss the bourbon and bacon shake... the unfried chicken and the hot bowls.... off. The. Chart."}
{"text":"Can I make two updates to my initial review?! This place gets better and better each time I go and try something new. 

The crepe station, holy holy goodness, why haven't I been bellying up to the crepe station this whole time?!?! tell the server its what you want, and he or she will bring you a ticket that you take up. or, do like me and order an egg (scrambled or fried) to go with it and the egg will be up there waiting for you. BRING CASH FOR THE TIP JAR. i didn't have any and felt bad as a result. because the savory crepe was so delicious. 

if you're super hungry, you'll have room for a side order of rosemary potatoes too. 

not sure if its on the actual menu or not, but you can order an irish coffee from the bar too."}
{"text":"Food is great, patio is nice, lots of drink options and space. Only downside is that it attracts the same people every weekend and many college kids."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really delicious food. Simple yet very very good. Expect a wait as it is first come first serve, but well worth the wait. Many GF options available and the draft list is pretty impressive. Seating is available at the bar, restaurant and cafe."}
{"text":"This spot warrants a higher rating than it currently has. Had a great time at Townhall. The ambiance and decor is absolutely awesome. One of the best places to lounge around and kick back a variety of good beers. Ordered a bunch of apps and other menu items for our group to share. Everything was very good. Simple dishes like fries and nachos were dressed up with a gourmet twist. Very fitting. The service was good! Seems to be the general gripe with everyone else. Truth be told, she checked in with us too much. Out fault, as we were pretty indecisive with the long draft list and menu. Will be back next time I'm in that area!!!!"}
{"text":"Townhall is my go to when I want to tell myself I'm eating healthy, but I'm not all that much and, if I'm being honest, the fact that I also wash it down with four or five craft beers doesn't help. Go on the specialty nights -- paleo, vegan, etc. the special menu items are just very very tasty.

Dinged one star for inconsistent cocktail menu -- you can order the same drink five times in a row and it will look and taste five different ways on top of costing at least $11. Would rather see them nix the cocktail menu than keep disappointing there."}
{"text":"I think Townhall is very solid. It's not going to blow you away with any of the food options but the service is always great and the restaurant is clean and comfortable. The back patio is great as well with many different drink options. It is definitely worth a try when you're in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan, vegetarian, paleo friendly restaurant where the food is extremely tasty for all.  The restaurant boast a large selection of craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"What a neat spot for brunch. Place had a really cool vibe!  They had a great beer, wine and cocktail list. I started with a bourbon orange juice drink. It was delicious although the flower was slightly embarrassing :). 

We ordered the OHC Benedict and and Morning glory burger. My wife loved the benedict and the eggs looked to be cooked perfectly. My burger was outstanding. The egg was monsterous, the burger was the right temp and the sauce/avocado were delicious. Both of us also got the rosemary potatoes which were delicious. 

The service was also outstanding given how busy they were. We had a great time and will be back soon."}
{"text":"An impressive beer list reigns supreme on the decent and diverse bar menu.

With outdoor seating, a great list of local and craft beers, this is mellow place to spend a Sunday Afternoon.  Their beer list changes daily, so you need to order by number.  Good prices.

- Cheeseburger: It was decent burger that was cooked to the right temperature, but the bun seemed stale and a too carby.
- Truffle Fries: Cooked to perfection, perfectly crispy and flavorful.
- Edamame: Odd, and the bottom beans on the bowl were soggy.

This place has a charming atmostphere, with great outdoor space. The been menu alone is something to come back for."}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about this place. To make it short, the food is excellent; the service stinks. Want to hear more? 

I went with family to Townhall on the 4th of July, which may explain the terrible service we received there. It was a nice, warm day out, and we were lucky to be seated outside after about a 15 minute wait. The atmosphere outside is amazing; the neat zen decor, cute low tables and comfy cushiony chairs make this place truly unique. We had a dog with us, and they were more than willing to find a table that would accommodate the pup (and yes, they have food for pups!). 

Have you ever heard that term that describes a person who refuses to smile? Well, that was our waitress. I imagine having to work on the 4th of July on a hot day would make anyone miserable, but man. You have a job, you're getting paid, we're not such bad people. The drinks came fast (good beers, great cocktails), and the appetizers were truly satisfiying. The \"smashed avocado\" is just guacamole. The chips were good, but with 6 people we ran out of chips and asked for a refill. Finally, the food came, and it was guuuuud. I ordered the Grass-Fed Beef Bolognese, which was amazing. The \"spaghetti\" is actually spaghetti squash, so while it is filling, it doesn't make you feel like you're going to die of a food coma. The poached egg on top was a special touch. Halfway through the meal I was wishing for another beer, and ordered one. I waited for another 20 minutes. The waitress never made her way around until she was ready to bring the bill. The bill was adorned with beer that never arrived, plus a charge for the extra chips. When she was asked to fix the bill, she mentioned that we should have \"told her that we never received the beer.\" Well, too bad she never came back around, or we could have made that happen. I told myself to forgive the poor, smile-less service and after we paid the bill I went to the restroom. 

This is probably where it all went downhill for me. There were three waitresses standing in front of the mirror, talking about customers. I went into a stall, and while doing my business, I heard them complaining about being given all the worst tables. One of them claimed she was given tables where she couldn't show her ample body parts. Aww, heaven forbid! This extremely unprofessional behavior in a public restroom, with a customer in the bathroom, is unforgivable. 

I will come back here, only if we get a different waitress who can crack a smile. And a staff who gives a hoot about the customers they are serving. At least the smile-less service matched the terrible behavior in the bathroom - keep up the consistency folks. At least have some pride in the good food you serve so willingly."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim, not knowing much about the place. It was a suggestion from a friend that wasn't even with us - but the \"props\" he will be given will be plentiful. 

We went here on a Monday, which no doubt was the best day to go. Every Monday they have $3 craft beer night which is nearly an insulting deal. It's such a good deal for the beers they have to offer I feel like I am stealing it right from the tap into my mouth. They change the beers regularly and they have something like 40 taps. These are not just your basic crafts too - a lot of unique/rare ones as well. 

To eat I had the Bangkok bazaar.  It was a delicious, spicy, egg noodle dish with shrimp, pork, chicken, and snow peas - all for $10.50. The size and amount of shrimp alone was worth $10.  

Ambiance is cool, and relaxing. They had the heat jacked up to just shy of the surface of the sun, which was my only real major complaint here.  If you are a craft beer fan and/or want a good value the townhall is worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I just ate at town hall. The food was very fresh and on point as always. I got the grass fed burger it was made exactly how I like it. With the best fries ever. My friend asked for special requests with her chicken sandwich and it was made to her request also exactly how she wanted it to be made. 

Also, the servers are super friendly and made sure we had exactly what we needed. You can never go wrong by going to town hall. Specially on Sunday's for brunch you might have to wait to get seated but t is defiantly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch review. I had the Morning Glory Fork and Knife Burger.  Nothing special.  The bacon was excellent but skimpy portion for $4.  The coffee was pretty good.  Neat atmosphere.  Overall an acceptable meal but not worth the effort to dine here unless you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Great quick, healthy, and inexpensive lunch option just outside of downtown! The zoodle bowl is a delicious healthy option that I can't help but order over and over, changing out the protein options that go with it. My kryptonite is the bone marrow broth you can order to sip on. I only pray it's not terrible for you, but if it is don't tell me (ignorance is bliss)."}
{"text":"Another spot locals told me to try the libations at....figured it couldn't worse than the neighbor market brewery.  I walk in, for the 1st time in a long time get carded....awesome job by the security. He tells me places to try after giving me a hard time from being from st louis....even Cleveland's finest chimed in.  
I walk up to the bar amd the young man behind the bar is making a drink, asks whats my flavor(i knew he meant drink) said probably a little mapleish.  Looks at me confused,then i placed my order.
The bar was packed, had great lighting for a night bar restaurant while the dj spun his tracks that could be heard on the large patio.  Not the quietest place or easiest to navigate but certainly cleared the poor taste of the city out of my mouth.  Left me wanting to come back again to eat and give that elusive 5th star."}
{"text":"Amazing food and hand crafted cocktails. If you are looking for a different kind of flavor this is your spot. Amazing summer time atmosphere too! This place does get really crowded so if that is not your style than you might not enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish I lived closer because I would be here all the time. I always come here for birthdays (they have the best cookie cake with ice cream and strawberries). I've been here for lunch a few times and loved it as well. People are always helpful and they're usually really busy, so service can be a bit slow. But they take care of everyone as fast as they can. The beer list is always amazing. The vegan chicken tacos are the best thing ever. I love the patio when it's warmer out. Always a good time to spend with friends. At night this place is the spot to be. They also have a late night menu, so you won't have to go searching for food after drinking. Although, my last visit I saw a manager (or another employee) grab one of the bar-backs by the neck and say something to him. I thought that was rude."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 because the atmosphere is great and the way they've set up the space, which makes you feel like you're outside wherever you sit, is awesome.

I found this place by yelping a farm to table in Cleveland. While the beverage selection is unbeatable, the food is just ok. I tried the fish tacos, and they were bland. My coworkers also commented that their selections could have been infused with some more flavor. 

Come here for the atmosphere and a great vegetarian selection, but don't expect to get blown away."}
{"text":"Ate Brunch here today and it was delicious!! I ordered the OHC Benedict and it was cooked perfect. Also got an order of the Parmesan truffle fries and they are the best I've had so far at any restaurant. My sister ordered the Full Monty and absolutely loved it. We also shared an order of the homemade biscuits with cinnamon butter and preserves. So good!!! Our server Hollace was wonderful!! Does get very busy here so don't be surprised if there is a wait!"}
{"text":"Town Hall has a very good beer selection, food that has always proven delicious, and helpful servers. This place is regularly packed with customers, so getting seated/service/drinks can requires a little patience, but they generally do a good job. The Ohio City area is very competitive dining/drinking district and this place matches or outdoes its neighbors."}
{"text":"Townhall is terrific. Veggie burger shames pretty much any carnivore-burger, wait staff is fun and knowledgeable, ambience is energizing. A personal favorite."}
{"text":"When I told Lauren K that I was in the midst of Whole30 her plans for a delicious, authentic pierogi lunch were squashed. Good thing she's quick on her feet and we re-routed our hangry pains for Townhall. 

I'm not surprised that this modern, hipster place does so well. The menu is deep with options for any taste preferences. Whether you're vegan, gluten free, or just angling for an incredible lamb burger and fries, there's something here for you. The servers were also very friendly and helpful, being sure to ask about any dietary restrictions/modifications even after ordering. 

After perusing the menu, I went with the tuna poke cold bowl and the greengo juice. The tuna itself was just ok, I've had far better raw tuna, but the flavors combos with the sauce, zucchini noodles, radishes, and avocado were nice and bright. My greengo juice was the star of my lunch, though. It had just enough heat to pack a punch without being an inferno. The spirulina, pineapple, jalapeno, and cilantro melded into one hell of a fresh juice. 

I applaud Townhall for catering to those with strict dietary preferences/requirements...it ain't easy eating clean!"}
{"text":"Townhall was good, but not as great as others told us it would be. We arrived to Cleveland on a beautiful day and decided to walk around, this place is conveniently located to a lot of Clevelands best attractions. We ordered two blue berry ciders from the bar and they were so good! The atmosphere in this place is pretty trendy and hip which I loved! They have a bunch of table games you can play if you're not there to dine, which is what we did. We loved this atmosphere so much that we returned the next day for brunch. First, I love that they cater to a paleo lifestyle with their menu! Second, it was the worst bloody I've ever had. WARNING if you don't like sludgey cucumber juice or pickle bribe do not order it. I took one sip and knew this wasn't the drink for me, so I asked if I could have an orange juice mimosa instead and it came out brown? Not sure how that happens. The food was a pretty big disappointment as well, the Thai noodles were overly spicy but had no flavor to them. The sweet potato hash was way too sweet. Overall I would definitely come back here for a Saturday drink but wouldn't return for the food.


*The manager did reach out to me after my review. They changed the Bloody Mary! We'll try to return next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places to eat! Luckily i live 5min away, so I'm here at least once a week. It's the only 100% non GMO restaurant in Cleveland, and they have a ton of gluten free and vegan options. I've tried almost everything on their menu-- it's all amazing."}
{"text":"The food and beer here are fantastic!  I had the Burrito2 with tofu and it was yummy, but I wish it was spicy or had an option for some spicy salsa.

I will have to say that the service was really awkward.  I have heard from many people that Town Hall's food is amazing but their service is pretty awful.  I was skeptic of others and tried it anyways.  They were all right.  The food was great, the service is rough."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch, and once with my wife for dinner. Food and service have always been excellent! Especially a great place for health conscious, or people with food allergies."}
{"text":"Really cool spot in the heart of Ohio City. Went for dinner, there was a nice crowd. The food was good, I got street tacos and nachos. Both were good and the restaurant was clean. I just wish my food was a little warmer. Resulting in 4 stars not 5"}
{"text":"I have eaten here maaaany times and every time I'm still amazed. The menu is non GMO with paleo and vegan options so you're eating healthy while wondering how it tastes SOO good! The atmosphere is so inviting and the servers/cafe girls are so adorable and amazing at their jobs.. ALSO 38 American craft beers always rotating with new beers daily, super fruit cocktails and organic coffee! A restaurant really can't get any better than Townhall"}
{"text":"Ok before we get into the nitty gritty of food and things I actually tasted, I'd like to talk about the fact that Town Hall sells cigars. Like, has a cigar menu of sorts and a stand. Now I don't smoke, but all I wanted to do was get a cigar and be all classy with a nice scotch. Of course it was -10 outside so I didn't. Next time!

Food! I had the Bangkok Bazaar and it was super tasty. I was a little wary of the fish sauce but decided to give it a go anyway. So glad I did. My boyfriend had the Kobe Steak Torta and he enjoyed it very much. I was only allowed a small bite, so that should tell you something. The steak was very tender and all the flavors complimented each other nicely. The fries it came with were awesome! They almost had a Lays chip taste to them. Delicious! Also, let's not forget the GF/VA options. Always love to see a restaurant with posted health signs on their menu.

One more thing (I know, I'm talking your ears off), Nintendo game systems! That's right, you can play N-64 while hanging out and drinking. I realize you can do this at home, but where can you do this at a bar? Town Hall that's where. So go grab a drink and a cigar, all while playing Mario Party!"}
{"text":"Not really a fan. I thought the food was kind of pretentious. I got some kind of Mule cocktail and the ginger was so overpowering it was undrinkable. I couldn't find anything on the menu that I wanted to eat so I decided to just get a salad. But they didn't have any Garden or Cobb they had hipster like salads with yams made by Switzerland goats or whatever. They didn't even have Ranch dressing.... Who doesn't have Ranch. 

Unless you are into the \"Hipster Scene\" I suggest dinning elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options, not just a salad but sandwich. Delicious food and beer. Always a fun vibe even when it's crowded which it can be because, well, it's good."}
{"text":"Went with some family for an early Sunday brunch and was impressed with the wait time for 10am on Sunday. Only a short 20 min wait and the servers were very responsive to the table. We started out with some coffe and espresso and enjoyed the fresh, organic atmosphere. The food was a mixed bag at our table. Two of the meals were a hit and two were a miss. Would definitely recommend the street tacos and the southern comfort. The breakfast burger with the chorizo hollandaise was just ok (burger was cooked to medium rare perfection) and the 25th street burrito was a bust. Overall, would love to come back and try some more!"}
{"text":"The Kobe Beef Bolognese needs to stay in the menu permanently. Excellent dish. Its the bees knees."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers.  My friend and I were served by a bartender whose name was, I think, Maryann?  Anyway, she was super attentive and friendly.  Being a female it's almost impossible to get served at bars by other females, it was nice to be in a crowded bar and actually get served in a quick and friendly manner.  Not sure about the other bartenders there but she was great and I hope the managers/owners see this and give her the credit she deserves."}
{"text":"Usually once or twice a year I make a trip up to Cleveland for a baseball game or concert. Every time I come to Cleveland, this is my go to place for lunch/dinner or really whatever occasion. This time we found a spot at the bar because the wait was pretty long for a table. All of the bartenders behind the counter took care of us and engaged us in conversations. I used my Yelp app to score me a free drip coffee today, and it was delicious. They mentioned it was Phoenix brand, so I will forsure be checking that one out! As for the food, I always get the 100% grassfed burger. It is always cooked to perfection, moist and all the tastes just come together so well. I cannot say enough good things about my experience here each and every time, so I can't wait for my next trip back already."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends at the bar and Gavin helped us! Great job! He took care of everyone and made sure we are happy! Thanks for making all my out of town friends feel like they are home!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  They have non gmo food that tastes great and is nicely priced!  I was surprised to see bone broth on the menu, which is sooo good for you!  Our server, Amanda, was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoy Town Hall. Their food is delicious, I love their beer selections, and the staff is GREAT. I know it gets packed and crowded and can have a \"fratty\" vibe on weekends, but I really don't mind that. I think my good experiences outweigh that.

The first time I was here, I was taking a well-deserved half-day from work with my co-worker and we needed somewhere new to go. The bar was pretty empty (probably since it was 2 p.m. on a Friday...), so we were waited on promptly. Our bartender was impressive in remembering our names, and even remembered us on future visits during busy weekend evenings - not something I'm used to! He suggested good beers for us to try, and we were not disappointed. A few months later, my friend and I were back and were accidentally given each others' beers. Upon us pointing this out, we were poured new beers but also told to keep the originals free of charge. So, if we wanted, two beers each for the price of one.

Their dinner menu is great, and I can't complain about the food at all. I've gotten salads, chicken tacos, and tofu tacos, and all are fantastic. I've only had good, attentive service when dining in, which I fully appreciate.

The patio is great now that the weather is nice again. I definitely recommend Townhall for a meal or early-evening drink. The night scene is hit or miss, but also worth a try."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Townhall I have a great time and amazing food. Always consistent and the service is always amazing. Really good draft menu, perfect for drunk Sunday brunch or nice Friday dinner. Reasonably priced and doggie friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been to Cleveland once, however, this is definitely the place to be. Everyone in town is talking about it. 

The upside: 

The food was good, a lot of options. Very efficient ordering system, food/drinks come out fast. The waitresses are smoking hott. 

The downside: 

I was constipated for 3 days and the bathrooms are completely bizarre."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town! I love the food and the huge beer selection! Also GET THE DATES they are amazing!"}
{"text":"We went on Monday/Vegan night. 

I'm definitely a meat-eater but wanted to eat somewhere my friend would have choices. The food looked so good I had a Vegan meal (cauliflower steak). It was so insanely flavorful and I was totally full all night. 

Craft beers were $3 as well which is a great deal. We liked it so much we went back on Saturday."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I was so excited to see Uber Eats is delivering from Town Hall. The lamb burger is the best I've ever had - nice portion, cooked perfectly, great seasoning, and the tzatziki is perfectly garlicky. The smashed avocado is a great sized appetizer for two with lots of freshly made tortilla chips, and the spicy cauliflower is fresh and flavorful. Can't wait to order again. So good!!"}
{"text":"if you are looking for a fun night and good food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I have had in Cleveland. I love the crepe bar and the paleo options. Their wall of beers is always changing and interesting. The smashed avocado and paleo chicken tenders are always a go to for me for dinner. I like that you can order using Uber eats."}
{"text":"I love the food at Town Hall. I have tried many of their dishes over the last few years and the only thing that wasn't amazing was the thai peanut bowl which was dry and bleh. I've loved every other thing I've tried so I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"All I have to say is YOU MUST GO. Quality of food and service is freaking amazing!!!! The hubby and I go here at least 3 times a month. Love love love!!!! Oh! And the brunch on Sundays whooooo Lord!!!! You just gotta see/taste for yourself. #happydining"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat. I LOVE that  this place is all NON-GMO.  So it's safe to eat here, food and drink-wise.  Some of my favorites are the coffee, the unsweetened iced teas, the chicken lettuce wrap, the bone broth, Thai peanut bowl, chicken tenders, and sweet potato skins.  I frequent this place with my husband and sons.  My husband gets crabby about the 15 min drive here from the suburbs... (we used to live right down the street many years ago and I like to be in the city) and we can't get a decent non- gmo meal anywhere else. No one wants to poison their kids, right?  A good time for the 4 of us to go with little wait is Sunday brunch.  My kids love the crepes, smoothies, grilled cheese, and Korean BBQ pizza.  Great place, great music, great atmosphere, great staff!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good spot for brunch on our way up to Chicago and Townhall nailed it on the head! Great vegan and veggie options, fresh juices and smoothies at incredible prices (compared to Brooklyn), and an awesome atmosphere to boot. Their acai bowl was everything I needed that Sunday morning which we failed to realize was high time for brunch but luckily, we found 2 spaces at the bar inside and were served immediately. We'll definitely be back next time we're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Tried the West Side Market flatbread yesterday with whole wheat crust and vegan cheese. Yum!

My husband's burrito looked terrible - it was all tortilla, chicken, rice, and quinoa. No color! He was completely underwhelmed. Liked his fries though.

Shared the Marrakesh Fresh salad which was delicious, but WAY overpriced for such a basic salad. $10 is ridiculous - it wouldn't have even been enough for an entree! Will not get again."}
{"text":"i normally come on weekend nights for drinking and socializing but today my fiancé and i had lunch here and we were absolutely not disappointed. it was a beautiful monday and both the front and back patios were full of people but we opted for the inside bar because while it was on the warmer side for november, i was still cold lol. 

we started with the truffle fries. i'm allergic to dairy so we got them without parmesan and they were INCREDIBLE. so delicious. whatever ketchup townhall has is also bomb. 

for lunch i had the thai peanut bowl, which was super delicious and my fiancé had the korean bbq pizza and he loved it. 

our cocktails were really good: bonita applebum! the bartender was super super sweet and very attentive without being overbearing and also very patient with the other customers who were getting obnoxious. 

will be back for more delicious lunches and i'm looking forward to trying their vegan and paleo monday nights!"}
{"text":"Delicious and the service is terrific! Food is fresh and not too heavy. Eggs Benedict was delicious."}
{"text":"The better things in life are worth the wait! After waiting 30 minutes for a table to clear up, I ordered the huevos rancheros which I was informed was a new dish. It was DELISH and I highly recommend it. Great presentation and flavor, with a large serving  size. I will definitely order this next time."}
{"text":"I've been back to Townhall twice since my last update, and have been very happy with those experiences! The management team was quick to follow up after my last experience, and their sincerity and friendliness convinced us to give TH another try and to keep coming back. Thank you for caring so much about your customers! 

The wait for brunch both times I visited were just about the hour they said, and worth the wait. With the nicer weather, it's easy to kill time walking around  Ohio city, too. The discount book store next door or the west side market are two great options to stay close by. 

Although the crepe bar will always be my favorite, I tried a new brunch menu item, the Full Monty, that came with root veggie hash, mashed sweet potatoes, egg, brussels sprouts and a side of bacon. It was so delicious I ordered it the last two times I was there! My guests ordered the grilled cheese/soup, and the eggs Benedict-both enjoyed their meals and look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Townhall several times. I have never had a bad experience here. It is usually packed when I come and it's shoulder-to-shoulder most times I have been there. 

There is an outdoor smoking patio/courtyard with heat lamps for the smokers. 

The bartenders and servers are all pretty chill and will converse with you despite the madness. 

I usually come here to drink, but I have had some of the food and I have never been disappointed. I love coming here for brunch. The best way to cure a hangover is with a few drinks the next morning at Townhall."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! 

What a cool concept. Fresh. Organic. Non-GMO items. 

So goooood. 

Busy busy spot so try to make a reservation. 

I got the organic acai bowl and it has chocolate and coconut shavings in it. It was soooo good!"}
{"text":"Great food & it looks like an awesome beer selection. Jenelle was a great server. Parking in the back is free."}
{"text":"You can't make a reservation here unless you know someone in the townhall/barley family. That being said, this place has the best patio for a sunny day, and by far the best burger in town. If you're feeling adventurous, their adult milkshakes are divine--- I never thought I'd crave a milkshake with bacon and salt in it but I do! Get here early, the wait can get long fairly quickly. Great selection of beers, but I'd steer clear of their in-house drink menu. They've attempted to make some artisan drinks and failed miserably on execution."}
{"text":"The decision to come here was... Regrettable.

The service from my waitress was impeccable, but that's where it ends. The server seated me at a table with dirty menus with the last tables receipts sitting on it. There was a clean table right next to it, yet she still insisted that I sit there... Why? The worst part of this place is THE FOOD! The chicken nachos were okay (how can you mess that up though?). The tortilla chips were made fresh. What I did not like was the cauliflower tabouleh and tacos. I actually had to ask the runner if that was what I ordered, as there was little to no cauliflower in sight. The steamed vegetables were too hard and not well seasoned but the worst part were the TACOS. The taco didn't even make it to my mouth before falling apart... Can you still even call that a taco? Whoever made these need to double up on the tortillas or put less watery ingredients into the taco. 

This MIGHT be a good place for lunch or to grab beers, but other than that, I cannot recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Cleveland! We decided to come to Townhall on Saturday for Brunch. The wait was only about 10 minutes around 10AM but the line got longer as the morning went on. 

Their food was fresh and flavorful! I got the Benedict and it was very tasty. I also got the sweet potato pancakes and they were the BEST I've ever had. 

The atmosphere is something you can't find many places. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Even the Kardashian's did when they were in town. :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and overall enjoy the food. For as trendy and unique as their menu is, the food isn't as extraordinary as I'd expect, but it's made decently well and I'd eat here again with a group of people, if they chose it lol. 
Lettuce wraps were pretty delic (yet small). 

 Monday $3 all craft beers is however a fabulous deal. 
For bar hopping/going out this is definitely an end of the night after many, many drinks place. Fun, VERY loud, and drunk."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but everybody else and their cousin knows it. Plan to wait, or try to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Also, we get it, you don't like GMOs. You don't  have to have the waiting staff specifically mention it for every dish -- it's written on the dang door!.

I have never seen the place not packed and it is always very loud. They sat my girlfriend and I at a 4 top with another random group of 2, which I sort of wish they asked if it was OK first. 

The place is an absolute nightmare after dark. You can barely move around, the music is not great, and it's expensive. Not a must go to in ohio city in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for the week, I stumbled upon this place to get out of the rain on a Wednesday afternoon while lots of other places on the block were closed until dinner.  Had such a great time day drinking that I came back for lunch a few days later.

This place has everything:  coffee bar, juice bar, craft beer, cocktails, huge food menu with lots of vegetarian options.  Oh, and a bad-ass patio.

BEER:  So many awesome drafts and they're all $5!  Had two brand new offerings from Dogfish Head and Southern Tier.  

Cocktails:  They barrel age their own whiskeys and have a huge spirits list, including a couple locally distilled bottles.  They also have a list of cocktails made with their own fresh pressed juices.  I was skeptical that I was going to be drinking a salad with gin, but it was a really nice cocktail!

Food:  Huge menu with everything from burgers to pizzas to noodles and more.  Great options for vegetarians.  We had the stuffed banana peppers (v) and they were waaaay better than I thought they would be.  My veggie burger was made in house and it was OK.  Probably wouldn't get it again as I'm also a meat eater, but it was fine.

Service:  Both at the bar and at the table, service was great.  Fast, friendly, laid-back and fun.  The bartender from our previous visit even stopped by our table to say hey when he saw us."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Town Hall. My veggie burger was DELICIOUS!! My friend got the burrito, he said it was good, a hipster burrito. I really like the patios in the front and back. I understand the restaurant did just open so I won't complaint too much about how sloooow the service was. I want to go back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"We went to this place twice over a weekend visit to Cleveland. A great brunch and lunch place with lots of healthy and balanced food and drink (juices, smoothies and beer) options. For lunch I tried the thai peanut bowl and it was really good with lots of veggies, tofu and chicken over brown rice. Then two days later we came back for Sunday brunch, and I got the grilled cheese and soup. The juices at Town Hall are also really great and reasonably priced. Overall, this was hands down one of my top picks in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"**Brunch review**

Town hall should be your breakfast/brunch stop on Sundays before heading to the game.

At 11 and 12 there is a bus that will take you down to W 6th for free from Townhall, so take advantage of that and skip the rapid on the way there.

They have a crepe station on weekends and there was no way that once I laid eyes on it I could order anything else. For $7 you head up to the table and pick out a sweet or savory crepes with over 30 topping options all laid out so you can see! I went with a sweet crepes with tons of berries and Nutella, it was huge and fun to watch make. Everything else that was coming out of the kitchen was drool worthy too. Also, now that I tried their pour over coffee, I'm dying for another cup! 

I stayed away from this place for awhile feeling that it would fall into the kitschy trendy trap, but now I cannot wait to return for dinner and drinks whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was amazing!  The moment we walked in the door, it was an exciting, amazing atmosphere! My daughter who is vegan got the nachos and we split them, they were so good!! I got the Asian hot bowl and my daughter got the zucchini pasta bowl, both were beyond delicious! As we were eating, a man who was alone and looked very scary and disturbed came up behind me and was talking to himself, my daughter frantically got up and asked the bartender who this man was and if he was eating here, he was mentally ill and they had to ask him to leave. After he left, the manager, Adam, came and talked to us and told us he was very sorry and it made my daughter feel a lot safer. A few minutes later, we got our dessert menu and all of a sudden, our amazing server Rebecca came to our table with a FREE vegan dessert! They are so awesome and go above and beyond to make their customers happy, I would 100% recommend (not to mention the music being played throughout the restaurant was awesome!)."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing drinks, great atmosphere. Every restaurant should take advise from this place. All around great establishment."}
{"text":"I love town hall.  Their food is thoughtfully prepared offering vegan, vegetarian, and paleo options.  Very few restaurants in Cleveland are this mindful.  Thanks town hall!"}
{"text":"We were recently in Cleveland for a U2 concert.  On Sunday I wanted a good brunch and I couldn't have found a better spot.  They accommodated our group of 9 easily.  Their al fresco dining is tops.  We sat outside in a cool cabana.  Everyone in our group loved it, which is a huge accomplishment for a large group.  The food was amazing!  We had a vast mix of food preferences including gluten free and vegan.  The menu had something for everyone.  Bonus that everything on the menu is GMO Free.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and couldn't have been happier!  When you see your food arriving in a cast iron skillet, you know its going to be the bomb! The sweet potato hotcake is also amazing!!!!!!  They have a crepe station with an abundance of toppings and fillings.  My son's crepe was HUGE!!! They don't limit the toppings that you select....my sister in law was able to get a vegan crepe and she said it was delicious!  The maple glazed bacon is a must have too! Only complaint was from my husband who didn't care for his coconut pancake.... I think that he was just jealous after he tried my sweet potato hotcake.  My mango mimosa was also yummy.  Great prices and atmosphere.  The place was packed and rightfully so.  We even had a balloon specialist visit out table to make balloon hats and animals.  No kids were in our group which made it even more fun! The ambience, food, and friendly staff make this place a winner. This will always be on our list whenever we visit Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, it's not very often I find a restaurant that offers a variety of dishes which follow my diet. Usually I find myself eating salad and veggies which can get boring really quick. Townhall offers milkshakes, desserts and several items on the regular menu which are vegan available. Not to mention- every Monday is vegan night and they have an additional menu with just vegan options and they are all phenomenal! Aside from this, the beer menu is outstanding. My dad loves coming to townhall because of the 36 different beers in draft! As if the food and beer selection isn't enough for a 5 star rating, the staff and atmosphere are incredible. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"As always, it was a fun time with excellent food and service.  Our waitress, Natalia, was on top of all of our orders and a delight! I ordered a zucchini and veggie chicken \"pasta.\" It was fabulous. Everyone enjoyed their food, especially me!"}
{"text":"SO PLEASED WITH OUR MEAL HERE.

We were picking up a friend from the airport and wanted to grab a bite afterwards (9pm-ish). We ordered the avocado appetizer to start, which is really just non-Mexican guac, and then split the veggie burger WITH TRUFFLE FRIES and the bangkok bazaar. Our other friend ordered the grilled cheese bars, coups, and a side salad. All of it was good; the veggie burger and truffle fries were unrealllllll.

Prices are reasonable for the amount and quality. Very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"I am in love with Townhall.  We had some vegan and vegetarian friends in town, and we ended up coming back for brunch, after we had dinner the night before.  The service and atmosphere are great, but they really shine with their menu.  So many wonderful choices, that even the pickiest eaters from vegans to steak and potato eaters can dine together.  There is such a nice variety of options and combinations as well- truly a wonderful spot for any meal."}
{"text":"Have been to Townhall in the past for drinks and dinner, and liked the atmosphere and food. But then I'm not a dinner person anyway.

What I am is a brunch person, and love to explore places that serve good brunch. I had noticed the \"Build your own Crêpe\" on Townhall menu on Yelp and had been meaning to try it out for quite sometime.

Now today happened to be that day. And I'm just wondering why it wasn't before! 

Was celebrating a work milestone + hanging out with some friends and being a beautiful summer day, wanted to sit on the patio somewhere. Yelp said Townhall has patio seating so we went there. The patio is nice by the street, though is not as sunny as I had wanted around noon. But still fun enough, and not too crowded despite being a Sunday (Unlike Lucky's, my other place of choice for brunches). There was no wait and we got nice spots to sit right away.

We ordered the Build Your Own Crêpe. It is pretty nicely priced at less than $7 for all the choice of toppings you want. There's a bar where the guy makes crêpes by your choice right there. The sweet selection had options for strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, vegan chocolate, apples, bananas, strawberry jam to name a few and of course peanut butter, Nutella and whipped cream! The savory had chicken, bacon, sausage, onions, tomatoes, peppers, mushroom, potatoes (surprisingly taste nice!), variety of cheeses and sour cream to name a few (or what I can remember. These are made on wheat batter. 

The crêpes were amazing.. And nicely tailored to what you want. Couldn't decide whih we wanted, so ordered a couple of each kind. I will need to come more often to try out different combinations. Definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"As an individual with obscure food allergies, this place really knows their stuff. Everything is made in house and the chefs know exactly what went into each of the sauces and different aspects of the meal. I have never felt more at ease while eating at a restaurant knowing that my allergies weren't misconstrued in translation. 

I highly recommend this place not only for the high quality food (both brunch and dinner) but also for the beer selection.

This place is one that is much better when you call ahead or make a reservation to ensure seating is available because of it's popularity."}
{"text":"Another Yelp find on our way through Cleveland.  When we lived here, we typically avoided W. 25th since the trendy bar scene isn't really our thing, and our experience with dining in this area has been iffy, at best.  This place had just the dinner we were looking for, though.  Extensive beer list, including many new ones to me and a few breweries that I love and can never find anywhere.  So many things on the menu that sounded great, and loved that so much of it was vegetarian-izable.  Mainstream restaurants finally discovering seitan - LOVE it.

We were very pleased with the friendly (and fast) service on a crowded Thursday afternoon, the prices were decent, and after dinner I had a milkshake to go that was just delicious.  We're just sorry this place wasn't around when we lived here."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best brunch spots in CLE. The food is always outstanding, not a bad thing on the menu. Something on the menu for everyone. The atmosphere is great love it, but what truly made our experience one of a kind was our waitress. Cassie  gave us great, speedy service even with a crazy brunch crowd. Always refilled our waters, gave us bottles of water which I think is a great mark of excellent service. She also gave great recommendations (I got the townhall burger). Definitely coming back and asking to be in Cassie's section. Cassie gets a 5 star review and so does Townhall !"}
{"text":"They have wonderful gluten free, vegan, and paleo options for people who are looking. Their vegan salted caramel milkshake with organic coconut milk is phenomenal, as is their acaí soda refresher. I had a bowl (I forgot which one) that was similar to fried rice but was moderately spicy, had tofu in it, and was just great. My family also got a flatbread, the chicken burrito, protein style burger with a Greek sauce on it, and food truck tacos and we're all very impressed by their choices. This was my third time here, will definitely be visiting again!!"}
{"text":"Townhall is a fun spot to get a great meal or to hang out with friends. My favorite meal there is always brunch. They've got a great variety of options but the best choice is always Build Your Crepe bar!  They have what appears to be an endless choice of sweet or savory toppings to use when creating your crepe.  My favorite is always a savory crepe with chicken, prosciutto, bacon, raw onions, mozzarella, parmesan with sour cream and a side of berries.  You may want to also consider getting a side of rosemary potatoes.  Delicious!  Not in the mood for a crepe?  Consider the 25th Street Burrito.  I enjoy getting it with bacon and removing the black beans.  This burrito has a delicious taste and is served with chips and pico!

I've been to Townhall for dinner and have enjoyed their burgers and tacos.  I tend to not order a drink at Townhall unless it's a brunch mimosa.  I'm not a beer drinker and I find the mixed drinks a tab bit pretentious but if you're adventurous, there are a lot of inventive options to choose from.

On a sunny day, Townhall has a great patio that offers a variety of seating options.  Be aware that on Brown's home game Sundays, the wait for a table can be long because a shuttle runs between Townhall and the stadium so it's usually busier than usual.

If you come to Townhall and there's a long wait, consider sitting in their cafe.  They serve the same food as the restaurant instead you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you when you're ready.

Townhall is a great choice if you're visiting the Cleveland area or you're a local just looking for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We had a group of 9 for dinner on a Thursday. Then needed some space to chat after our BNB decided that checkout was 10.  So we had a great lunch in the cafe room (think Panera).  Amazing space particularly the back deck.  Service was excellent by a large crew of well trained energetic young workers who acted as a team to get the right food out promptly.  Vegan and gluten free dishes were tops.  And try the tomato bisque soup.  The whole place has a great key west feel without the attitude or high prices.  Big space. Prompt service and attracts a younger hip crowd as well as familires and groups.  Amazing menu.  And serviced by uber eats if you are staying nearby.  But then you miss the ambiance of this amazing space.  Kitchen produces amazing food and the owner watches the front of the house from the center of the room to ensure hot food quick.  Amazing execution. Great space.  Don't miss it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love town hall's drinks and food and is one of my favorite eateries. Unfortunately, today I am having a severe reaction to a nut right now. I called them to find out more information and they really did not care. It would have made me feel better if they even pretended to care. This is extremely frustrating and also my very first negative yelp review."}
{"text":"Colossal cupcakes and fresh juice!!! Try the spicy curry chicken noodles if you like spice. Ask for extra cilantro. The apple, lemon, ginger, carrot just was perfection.  This place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanna give this a good review, I really do. 
I can tell the company makes the effort to give good customer service and to be accommodating towards different people of different diets. However, there's a few things that need to be fixed. I realize it takes time to make your business into what it needs to be. 

1. Guys. It's too loud. I am not even two full decades old yet and I think it's too loud. Just because you're blasting music doesn't make it hipster and trendy and a hotspot. It's just annoying. It's Ohio City, not the East Village. Chill fam.

2. The customer service. The girls at the coffee bar were educated in the menu, sweet and really friendly. But the other 3 times I were here, I had terrible service from the waitresses. They say it's a one time thing but it happens all the time.

3. Some of the food needs improvement. Every item on the menu seems like an interesting concept but sometimes, the spices or ingredients just don't taste right. The veggie chili and guacamole? Amazing. The food truck tacos and veggie burger? Eh.  

Good things:

1. Diverse menu. Some of the things on the menu I've never seen before and it's so awesome it's accommodating to different people. Vegan, paleo, gluten-free. Yes! This is GREAT.

2. It's in a good location of Cleveland so it's perfect before a sports game or concert.

3. Like I said, they have good intentions. It's hip and new...so let's see where this goes.

Overall:

Do I think it's worth a shot? Yes.
It all depends on your experience. The food still needs some improvement, I think. Things that you think will be amazing turn out to be just average.

I think the reason Townhall has some bad / average reviews is because people have high expectations. They have a good PR team, an amazing menu, options for every diet, and it seems like it would have a great aesthetic. This is BIG for Cleveland. I really have hope in this place, and it's better than a lot of places in Cleveland, I just think they need to tweak a few things for a more consistent image. With more quality imagery, customer service, and food? This place will be a Cleveland hit."}
{"text":"Great place! Very upbeat place. Love the healthy choices and brunch is amazing!"}
{"text":"Townhall is a pretty trendy spot, and not without reason. The location is perfect, right smack in the middle of all the Ohio City 25th St happenings. The inside is beautifully done with natural wood. They have garage windows in front and back which are fantastic in the warmer months. The front has a few outdoor tables, but it's the back patio that is really set up well, and almost tricks you into thinking you're on holiday for the afternoon. This is a great place for groups, as they have long tables, and they take reservations. It gets pretty busy, so seating a large party can be a bit difficult even with all the longer tables. As for service, it's not bad, I haven't really had any rude experiences, but it's not the most attentive. They give you bottles of water to refill your glass, so that solves my biggest problem, and for that I praise them. Not bad, not remarkable. 

Where Townhall falls a bit short in my opinion is their vegan meals. My meat/dairy eating friends tend to rave about the food, so I'm not going to say the food overall isn't great. They put a modern flare on just about all their dishes which is great for most people (took my mom there for Mother's Day one year, and she hated it. She's isn't very adventurous, more of a meat and potatoes and other homestyle american kind of person. If you have really boring eaters in your group, it may not be the best). Personally, I love when chefs come up with creative meals with good fresh ingredients. I just haven't yet been wowed with the food. I don't want to say there isn't a vegan meal that I would love, I just haven't found it. Next time I go to brunch I'm going to try the crepe bar, as they have quite a few vegan options, and it may end up having me rave about the place! That being said, I appreciate the effort very much, and it's great to be able to go out to a place my friends love and eat a meal consisting of something other than steamed frozen veggies, fries, and if I'm lucky, hummus. 

Side note: they give you a little cup of ketchup to go with your fries. Mine was not even 1/2 full. Maybe they've found that it gets wasted because the standard fries come with Parmesan, but man if you are serious about ketchup, you may want to ask for more in advance. 

Oh and YUM for the vegan salted Carmel milkshake made with the ice cream from Mitchell's next door."}
{"text":"Love this place so much, awesome brunch, lunch and dinner. Tons of VEGAN options and all GMO free!!! cute environment and good for birthday celebrations! Try the smashed avocado for an app, never disappoints:)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in cleveland. Maybe my favorite restaurant ever... the staff is always friendly, the food is amazing, and just the vibe here is awesome. I wish I lived closer I would probably spend all of my money here."}
{"text":"If you have an allergy of any kind you'll be familiar with the hell that is trying to find a place to eat that has more than one or two options on the menu you can actually safely eat. Sometimes it's nice to have more than just a salad or a piece of unseasoned salmon on a night out, you know? It's places like TownHall that are starting to finally make that dream a reality. Their menu is almost entirely gluten and vegan friendly with special nights of the week dedicated to those with even stricter diets like Paleo Night on Wednesday and Vegan Night on Mondays. 

Even if you're allergy free and just looking for somewhere you will feel good about spending your time and money, I guarantee this will be your new favorite spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Oh Townhall.... one of my favorite restaurants! You can not go wrong with this place! I just had the mint matcha tea with chocolate milk added to it... omg it was amazing!! 

The bone broth is great! A tad salty but still awesome! 
They have such a great variety of healthy drinks... whether it be kombucha, cold press juice, or yummy teas! The beer selection is pretty darn good too! 

Now on to the food... 
well my favorite day is obviously Paleo Night on Thursday nights... they have such fun options and changes all the time .. 
I just got back from there a few hours ago and I had the gluten free spicy chicken sandwich! Yum yum yum.... it hit the spot! 
Mnt husbands favorite dish was the beef bolognese but they recently changed the \"noodle\" from spaghetti squash to zucchini noodles.... we are not a fan of the change at all.. I hope they change that back!! 

Will update when I go back in!!"}
{"text":"Townhall is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. They have an adaptable atmosphere that you can go to for a variety of reasons from family dinners, watching games, out on the weekend or for brunch. The staff is very attentive and they have a wide, healthy variety of beers and food for all to enjoy, even children."}
{"text":"Now I'm giving 5 stars for the brunch. I haven't eaten here for lunch or dinner so I can't say the same. My boyfriend and I went to Townhall for brunch on a late Saturday morning before hitting up the west side market. There was a wait but we found 2 bar stools at the bar and decided to just sit there. 

This bar is a comfortable bar. Many times when you go to a restaurant sitting at the bar isn't totally comfortable because of the stools or you have to lean over to eat your food or there isn't nice leg placement. Townhall's bar is super comfy.. the bar height to stool is just right and the seats were comfy and warm.

The bloody mary's are so good. Everything is homemade with them. We also tried some mimosas and you can get ones that are made with hard cider.. delish. Now the food was the real star. My boyfriend got the burger and mmmmmmm was it tasty. I got this sweet potato hash, spinach, bacon, egg, onion pepper thing (can't remember the name) and it was AMAZING. The bacon is more like pork belly its really thick and has lots of fat so if you like that you would love this. I'm really weird about fat on meat so I trimmed it off as a i could and gave the rest to my boyfriend.

The only con for our experience was the service. The first bartender we had was sweet, helpful and attentive.. our mistake though i guess we slid down 3 chairs to be in front of the tv screens for the OSU game and I guess we get another bartender on that side. He would let us sit without a drink for a while.. my boyfriend didn't get to order another drink until after his meal and it was out before our meals came. He just wasn't attentive. Also the covers on the tvs were dirty and had water marks so it was hard to watch the game clearly."}
{"text":"My husband and me ordered takeout and it was pretty good. Service was great with the cashier opening each box to make sure everything was inside. She also double checked for napkins and silverware.

My husband got the farmer flatbread which had bechamel sauce, white cheddar, chorizo and an egg. It was to die for and a good size for the price.

I got the food truck shrimp tacos and they were okay. The menu said rock shrimp, but I got really tiny little shrimp. The rest of the taco was filled with a cole slaw and guacamole. I asked for sour cream on the side. I got the truffle fries as my side dish and those were awesome too."}
{"text":"Great menu, lots of options for dietary restrictions. The beer menu is extensive as well, really this place has something for everyone. Recommended before Indians games as they will shuttle you to and from the game (free parking behind), although reservations are recommended on game nights."}
{"text":"Some call this place hate hall due to their service and atmosphere. However, I love the Paleo and vegan selections. If you do not like fireworks and fanfare around your dining, you should avoid. On any day later in the week, you should go to the cafe for ordering if you want to eat in a decent timeframe."}
{"text":"What an a absolutely fabulous time! My husband and sister in law and I came to town hall before a concert. It was our first time here and it was AMAZING! We originally came in for a few drinks, and our bartender Ashlyn offered us a menu. She recommended the smashed avocado, and my husband was eying the truffle fries. I ordered a wine, and my husband asked about the beer.  They have an eclectic  amount of American Craft drafts that were on tap! I can't even remember how many! Our food was spot on! There wasn't a long wait for anything, and we didn't have to flag anyone down! Our bartender was informative on the menus and the drinks! And our glasses were never empty! From the great attitudes that greeted us at the door, the stellar service, and the amazing food, this place is now our go to date night location."}
{"text":"Went to Townhall for lunch and ordered the traditional flatbread. It was disgusting. It tasted like cardboard and it was soggy. I actually put salt on it to try and help improve the flavor-it didn't work. They also gave me dirty dishes to use-which I had to ask for. If you want a delicious flatbread you should go to Lago. Townhall's food is good when you are drunk and trying to sober up, otherwise It's trash. Cute atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"Food was decent service decent patio is very nice however the owner was quite the asshole. I was outside and got asked by someone from ESPN who was filming a show there if I would sit behind their set because of what I was wearing the owner proceeded to tell me I wasn't supposed to sit there he had reserved the table for his own employees he dressed up in cavs gear just to get on TV lol what a loser turns out ESPN trumps his opinion even though he's the owner considering we got to sit there. Definitely could use some help in the customer service aspect of ownership"}
{"text":"TownHall, TownHall, Townhall ... how I love to loathe thee. 

I think the food is pretty piss poor (minus the dates --- GET THE DATES). I've tried a variety of other menu items (burger, fries, biscuits and gravy, burger, a few different pizzas) and have literally not liked any of them. They all sound delicious and look great on the menu but the execution sucks. They definitely miss on the delivery. 

That being said, go here. The place is always packed!! Happy hour is wall to wall packed. Their patio is huge and in the summer was awesome! Friday & Saturday nights are insane. It's hard to move around the mass sea of people. 

They have a great beer selection that changes \"daily\" or as the kegs run out. They generally have a lot of Ohio beers to choose from, which I love. Support your local breweries! Brian, Kyle, and Lauren are the best behind the bar! I go there just to visit with them."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go hang out! I really enjoy coming here for Sunday Brunch (you HAVE to get the tomato soup and grilled cheese) and having some mimosas on the patio. Or we enjoy coming here for happy hour after work or a night out. This place is awesome for all types of moods. If you want to have a chill day, come here on a Sunday. If you want to have a fun happy hour come here after work. Or if you want to go out for drinks on a Saturday night, this is still the place to go. 

Service is always great, the drinks are amazing and the food is delicious. They change their menu every so often, the variety is great. I love that there's free parking behind the restaurant or there's the valet option out front."}
{"text":"This review covers two visits. I had brunch here on Sunday, 6/22 and then had a bite to eat and some drinks here on Sunday, 6/29. Our brunch party consisted of 7 women. We were seated at a table a the front, just where the indoor/covered portion starts.When we asked for chairs with backs, we were accommodated. The server graciously split our checks, even though we were technically over the limit.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals and their drinks, and we all agreed that we would return.  Little did I know how soon I would return. Last night there were 9 in our party and we were seated on the back patio. Again, everyone enjoyed their meal - particularly the vegan options that were available. Again, the server graciously split our check. 

As far as specifics on food/drink: 
For brunch I had the Southern Comfort, which is a unique take on biscuits with sausage gravy. The sausage preparation was a bit different as it was not crumbled, but rather consisted of links cut into pennies. The egg that accompanied it was a nice touch, but the yolk was too runny for my liking. Next time I would ask for it to be cooked a bit harder. However, even a more-runny-than-I like egg couldn't ruin the amazing biscuits. I'm not sure that I can even describe them. Moist, not dense but also not light, baked to a perfect golden brown - I could've eaten just the biscuits and been happy; they were that delicious. The mimosa was nothing special. Good, but I've had better.

For dinner I had the Classico Flatbread (with red peppers added), which was far too big for one person IMO. I ended up sharing slice and taking most of it home. The best part of it was the shaved cheese and the preparation of the tomatoes. The flavor in the tomatoes was so good. They seemed to have been slightly caramelized. I had a pint of cider to accompany it. I'm still in search of a cider that I like as well as Magners/Bulmers and I didn't find it here. Decent but still not the best.

I will definitely return to Townhall if the opportunity presents itself (I'm invited, it's convenient, etc). I tend to continue trying new places, and they didn't wow me enough to pick them regularly, but they are a solid choice in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I can probably keep this short and sweet if you are looking for a vegan (it's not actually all vegan) restaurant that has a great beer selection where the four that you would actually enjoy drinking are out, this is your place.

The worst part about this place is that the menu items all sound so great you think to yourself you can get past that one thing that doesn't seem to fit in. This is the trap that makes you and your friends go back, though the experience never gets better.

If you want a meal that is guaranteed to be good and won't make your friends question your future dining choices go to any of the other hot spots on west 25th."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. The avocado & chips was the best thing we had. The street truck tacos with rotisserie chicken tasted good, but the chicken was on the cold side and had bones. The flatbread pizza was bland. They have drinks made with fresh fruit but bcz it wasn't \"fruit season\" they couldn't make any of them? I tried a few of their \"seasonal\" drinks but they were just alright. The beer list was pretty much all IPAs, which I don't like so I didn't drink from the beer list. The server we had was really inattentive and not cut out for the service industry. She was pretty though so we didn't complain.
I'd probably give 3 starts if it weren't for the bones I kept biting into in the tacos."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best bars/restaurants in Cleveland. I've been going since it first opened and never once has it disappointed. The Sunday brunch is also one of the best in town - Morning Glory, the Benedict, grilled cheese & soup, the crepe bar... you can't go wrong. If you're into craft brews, the selection is endless with at least 40 craft beers on draft and specials all the time. The service is always awesome and we love Dijana, we ask for her each time and is literally one of the nicest servers, super knowledgeable about the menu and awesome! Definitely go in the summer too, their patio is gorgeous and smoothies are perfect."}
{"text":"Everything is spicy.! You choose if that is good or bad. The place is lovely and the best thing is all organic, and healthy."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after completing the Puzzles by the Glass bar crawl. It was so crowded, if you have more than 4 people be prepared to wait on the weekends. We had 5 the wait was about an hour a half but we found 2 bar spots and the gentlemen with us just stood behind us and we ordered all finger foods to be safe. They also have cafe seating on the other side which is first come first serve but it was pretty full and the one table that \"open\" still was covered in food and dishes so did not want to chance it in case the occupants were just out smoking or to the restroom. 
The beer selection was amazing. Such a great variety and I really enjoy how detailed a one page menu can be!! They really nailed that! 
As for the food, we ordered the truffle fries which were amazing, definitely can't go wrong! We also ordered the nachos, I do not eat meat so I did not enjoy them but the boys loved them! They said they ran out of chips before they ran out of toppings which NEVER happens with nachos. So great to have every nacho loaded up and plenty of chicken was visible so totally a good deal. We also ordered the shrimp tacos, they were just okay. Not a lot of flavor at all. The shrimp its self had zero flavor, nor did the street corn on them, there was a pineapple salsa on them but I only tasted it in 1 bite out of three tacos, they definitely needed a kick. So new rule, stick to Barrio for tacos and Townhall for beer and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Recently, I was given a gift card for my favorite restaurant, Town Hall.  Our kids were with their grandma, so that gave the wife and I some free time.  She called me on my cell on my way home from work and said, \"Where are we going?\"  Since I had already considered the opportunity, I prompty said, \"Town Hall!\"  She was excited at the suggestion.  So off we went.

Upon arrival on a Friday night, Town Hall was packed.  I mean, ever single table was taken, including all the seats at the bar.  The hostess suggested that we sit in the cafe next door, which is still owned and operated by Town Hall.  It shared a kitchen with Town Hall, so we agreed.  We went next door and sat ourselves.  We reviewed the menu and I figured I would try something different on this visit.  I decided to go with the Spicy Curry Chicken Noodle bowl and my wife had the Kobe burger.

I had an issue with the gift card I was given.  It didn't have a balance!  I didn't have a receipt so the manager wouldn't accept the gift card, but that wasn't his fault.  He did give us some drinks on the house for our trouble though.

Upon arrival, the chicken bowl was piping hot.  It was tasty, spicy, and delicious.  It wasn't very filling, so I then ordered some vegan chili.  The vegan chili was awesome!  Loved it!

After I make my journey around the menu, I'll return to my two favorite dishes thus far: the Kobe steak and the Chicken burrito.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Went for business lunch today. Party of 2 at noon. They will not take a reservation for less than a party of 6.

This was my second time eating lunch here. Service was poor, we had to ask several times for refills on water, our check took forever to come, and we never received the take away boxes we asked for. We both ordered Diet Coke and both drinks had a funky taste and were undrinkable.

I had the Marakeesh salad with chicken added. The chicken was poached not grilled and looked gray. Overall a poor dish. 

Will not return unless forced to for a work obligation. Much better food next door at Market Garden Brewery or across the street at Bar Cento."}
{"text":"They cannot seem to make up their minds on what they want to specialize in!
I've been here several times, each time excited to try something new, hoping its not like the last one. All their dishes seem so intriguing, yet once you try a few and step back and look at the bigger picture, they cannot decide on doing one (or a few) things really well and sticking to them.
They have to be a cool place to go during the day with your family, and a club on the weekends. They have to have every food featuring a vegan element but still have meat in it. Their food selection is trying to be SO hip, that its way over the top, and sometimes lazily prepared.
Maybe I'm a grump about it, or maybe I've actually been to good restaurants that individually specialize what Townhall haphazardly attempts to do at an overpriced expense."}
{"text":"My family & I went here on Sat. around dinner time, so the mass of people was to be expected as well as the wait. However, they had the garage doors open to enjoy the beautiful weather, which is cool. But what I didn't care for was the small table directly next to the entrance, I felt like all 8 of us were sitting on the couples laps; hovering over their every bite and ease dropping in on their private conversation. Hands down as claustrophobic nightmare ! Or if you have really bad social anxiety I wouldn't go here- know matter where you turned you were knocking something over or someone was bumping into you. 
  I ordered their truffle fries & wound up sending them back, they were cold & tasted as if they had sat under the heat lamp for some time. But I tried my sisters fries & there was noticeably a huge difference, they were hot & fresh, and had way more flavor. Our waitress was really nice about it & even took them off of the receipt- so service is okay but just that. Whomever was busing tables & lighting the candle votive was kind of rude. He took my dads silverware without asking & didn't replace it. He also kept reaching in front of our faces during the meal instead of around or asking us to pass plates to him. 
  The food arrived incredibly fast considering how busy they were but I wasn't impressed with my $9.00 milkshake either. I thought the bacon, bourbon & pistachio shake sounded amazing but they should have used candied bacon firsts off..& then the shake was just ...bland. You could slightly taste the bourbon but that's it. Even the bacon didn't taste like bacon :( and the pistachio flavoring just wasn't there :/ I'd be willing to give this place another try as almost everyone else enjoyed their food (my mom didn't like her peanut rice dish -my husbands is way better!!!!) but maybe not on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"I love Townhall. I seriously need to come back because if loving TownHall this much is bad then I don't want to be right...lol.

NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS selection - out of this world. So refreshing for a non-drinker as myself.

FOOD -- Out of this world. So local. So fresh. SO tasty. The first time I came here, I met up with a friend and ordered a Salmon dish with vegetables. My friend and I split the truffle fries. I also ordered the green matcha drink. The salmon was well done and sooooo good. Those truffle fries were DA BOMB!!! The drink just topped it all off. I was so impressed with my meal. 

I came here again on my birthday (October 20, 2017) and ordered the vegetarian burger along with a Turmeric drink. YES, YES, YES. As a meat eater who has eaten plenty of vegetarian dishes, I definitely loved this one because it was full of flavour. Protein fix? Check. Birthday cake surprise? Check. The staff sang happy birthday to me and brought the most delicious mini cookie/ice-cream dessert. I was in heaven. And oh, I love the seating outside with the little fireplace. 

VIBE -- good vibes only. I remember coming here a third time in December to hang out by the bar with some friends. Although I don't drink, the vibe was cool enough where I didn't feel awkward. The whole inside is huge with TV screens by the bar and music playing which makes a party here fun.

P.S. They have a brunch buffet which I haven't tried but I saw the display back in Dec. 2017 and all the toppings for pancakes and waffles looked so yummy.

P.P.S. -- It gets very crowded here but the both times I came here (Fall 2017), I was outside where it was less crowded so the crowd didn't affect me. The 3rd time I was here was in Dec. 2017 because a friend from out of town was visiting and she really wanted to come here. That time around, I was inside at the bar and WOW, it gets packed inside. Try to arrive early.

Check out this place for locally sourced and healthy food and drink options. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really cute bar/restaurant with outdoor space and very airy and quiet large in Ohio city.

We went to the back to sit and have drinks while waiting for our seats. we saw empty seats and a couple said they had been empty for over an hour, so we sat down. about 10 min after we sat down, a bartender came over and said, um those were saved. And we were like, we were told they were empty for over an hour. She said, I can get you drinks but youll have to get up. We ordered drinks, she was VERY rushed and abrupt. My drink was made poorly. She had not pureed the berries enough and it was so thick and junky it was poor pulp than puree. She also left the bar and later on went to talk to her friends, two guys whom she was apparently saving the seats for. We asked her if we should get up and she said, Eh, um, nah. She was NOT friendly, and the service was poor. Then after waiting for 30 min, they decided to seat us in a unlit freezing outdoor corner that had been empty ALL ALONG. My friend asked for them to seat us elsewhere and after a 5-10 minute wait they seated us elsewhere.

After we were seated, We ordered an appetizer and entree each. I had the Bangkok bowl, and asked for extra thai chilis which were stated on the menu. The three entrees literally came out in 5 minutes, prior to the flatbread appetizer. That actually ended up coming out later. My bangkok noodles were gross- they had a ton of snap peas, NO chicken, No shrimp, and it was broken up noodles soupy, and had a TON of banana peppers. The waiter could tell I was not impressed and asked what was wrong. When I explained the issue, she stated \" THAT IS OUR THAI CHILI and IT DOES HAVE MEAT\". I was like, I'm sorry Ive been to thailand and eat thai food, this is a banana pepper, thai chili, are red mostly and are bird's eye chilis. The owner happened to see her and walked over and told her to take it away and remake it.

She then explained after bringing out a new one that they use banana peppers because local population doesnt eat thai chili. That doesnt change the fact of false advertising. Also the dish was still offputting and I had lost my appetite. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars was because it was super nice of the owner to try to fix issue right away without giving push back like the waiter.

FYI- the waiter had such a low cut shirt I could not concentrate on ordering, its very unprofessional and distracting.

Not my kind of scene."}
{"text":"Great location in the heart of Ohio City next to the Westside Market. They could probably get away with mediocre food and service and still get a lot of business, but they don't! The food is adventurous and delicious, the atmosphere is vibrant and cheery, and the service is efficient and warm. Be prepared for a wait, because Townhall is a favorite among many!"}
{"text":"Interesting tasty entrees-- organic, healthy, and in a cool Ohio City bar setting. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! I love Vegan Monday's! It get's super busy on the weekends but for good reason. Great beer selection, wonderful service, and tasty food. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I like the brunch menu. I usually order the knife and fork burger with egg whites, sweet potato pancakes,or the wakey wakey. The food is good but the portion size is small. During my recent visit, I started with the fortitude smoothie $7 for about 8oz (if that), it was tasty. The smoothie had an earthy taste with a hint of sweet but you definitely don't get what you pay for in size. Next, I ordered the wakey wakey with a side of bacon. Again, the food was good but you get one piece of bacon, one small buiscuit, and what may have been one egg? My fist was bigger than the egg portion and I am a petite woman. With tip, my bill was about $20 for brunch and I was still hungry when I left. Our waitress was so nice. She called us \"loves\". Overall, good experience. I think the portion size is small but the food is good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, I got the avocado and chips, great and the kobe beef burger, very tasty! great atmosphere and location and great service. the hostess Andrea was very helpful!"}
{"text":"O. M. G.  This place is popular for a reason. The menu is full of tasty things, with options for vegetarian, vegan, dairy free, gluten free and they also note any other allergies and use clean prep to accommodate. We started with a drink and vegan avocado smash at the bar until enough space opened up to sit at a table (we shared a long table with a spirited birthday dinner party- the more the merrier!) the pumpkin walnut goat cheese flatbread was amazing. I would return and try so many more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland, you gotta check this place out. It's right next to the West Side Market. There's a quick service counter, a crepe station, a full service restaurant, a patio and outside cafe seating. It's huge. 

There's a ton of vegan, gluten free and pales options. We went for brunch and we loved the fresh juice we got! Everyone was so friendly and we loved the atmosphere! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Service & hospitality were great for brunch (balloons and things to do for kids!). Food was good. Downside is it's very loud & there seems to always be a wait!"}
{"text":"This place truly lives up to expectations. Let me just start by saying that there is something here for everyone! Vegan? Gluten-free? Picky Eater? Foodie? Beer connoisseur? You're in the right place. 

The menu has so many different options that I'm not really sure how to describe the food. There are burgers, bowls, flatbreads, curries, salads, pasta, and more. Their beer list changes every day and there are also fresh pressed juices, smoothies, milkshakes, matcha, and coffee. We tried a few different appetizers: prosciutto-wrapped dates, truffle fries, and smashed avocado (let's be real, Townhall, this is just guacamole). As an entree, I had the food truck tacos. All of the food was delicious, and the prices were great for the quality of food and the generous portions. 

Next time I'm in CLE, I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice location, cool space.

Like others, uses lots of trendy buzzwords and expectations are set pretty high. Don't get me wrong - the food is very good, but I was expecting a bit more."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great atmosphere.  I did not have any food but if you are looking for a great, open venue with outside seating to drink...this is a great location for that."}
{"text":"Fun place to get drinks and hang out with friends. The food is decent but I think the atmosphere is what makes this place great."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in the city. Cool atmosphere. Must go if you're visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant, especially for someone who has gluten allergies. (celiac) You can literally eat almost anything off the menu unlike having a choice of one or two items when dining elsewhere!   My new FAVORITE!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed Townhall previously, but I feel compelled to update! Yesterday on FB, Townhall announced that it was Paleo Night and they were looking for people to come in and try the paleo pizza, and to comment any interest. I responded that my son and I were interested, and so Townhall (I don't know the person's name) messaged me, inviting us in.

It was very busy so we sat at the smaller bar, and told the friendly bartender that we were invited in. Instead of a small sample of pizza, we were each given a whole pizza, gratis. We ate one and took one home. It was delicious! Great crisp crust, which is difficult to achieve when cooking paleo/GF food. Spicy and tangy sauce--delish! We decided to get Down East cider--yummy. From the paleo menu we ordered the chicken tenders and the sloppy joe, both with sweet potato chips. Everything was DELICIOUS. We thought the chips tasted like they were fried in bacon grease...which is never a bad thing.

The food was fabulous, service was great, and I am reminded of why Townhall is my favorite restaurant/bar. Did I mention that they always have interesting hard ciders?"}
{"text":"I've only ducked in for a quick cup of the much touted \"bone broth\" --- to which all I have to say is um, who was in my kitchen when I made chicken soup and done stole my broth??! But - the day I was there was a Sunday and they had what looked to be a fab crepe station, so yep I will be returning to investigate!"}
{"text":"There is officially no reason to go to Melt again ever-- that is Town Hall's grilled cheese and tomato bisque.  I added prosciutto and fell in grilled cheese love.  The bread is crisp (not greezy).  2 kinds of cheeses.  A hint of garlic.  Joy.

After being spoiled by the VTR, other place's cocktails haven't excited me this much in a long time.  I had the Roseate-- JD honey and a grapefruit/lemon infusion.  Each sip was glorious.  

I would have liked to have tried my husband's Thai rice bowl, but it disappeared before I could get a bite. Husband was extremely happy.

The atmosphere really fits in with the neighborhood-- exposed brick walls, funky wood/art tables.  The patios were spacious and comfortable.  The service was friendly and attentive, but not cloying.  The crowd was dressed rather casually.  I would definitely recommend this place for a casual date or a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here for lunch today and we were just outright disappointed with the food.
I was expecting and hoping for healthy, local, high quality ingredients 'treated right' and simply...  with a little finesse, but none of the food met my expectations.
1. mushrooms trio (app) - These were seasoned with dried herb/spices, so it was gritty in my mouth. I would rather have just salt & pepper than dried bits. The larger mushroom pieces weren't cooked all the way through and were cold/spongy in the middle. They weren't salted enough. Then, there were just raw green onions and peppers (I think?) tossed on top.
2. Korean BBQ flatbread on standard/regular crust - the crust was good and nice amount of toppings and cheese... but there was nothing 'korean' about this! It was straight up BBQ sauce that was so so sweet and didn't have any heat/spice of korean food at all. For a 'health focused' place I didn't expect that sugar sauce. Tasted like a classic \"BBQ\" pizza, which I wouldn't have ordered. Ick. Probably good for kids.
3. Burger on brioche w/truffle fries - There is no reason to put sugar on french fries, so we were sad that these did (again, especially at a place that is 'healthy'?) They tasted of truffle 'scented' oil and like the mushrooms had dried herbs or seasoning on them.  The burger was okay. It was cooked as ordered and had nice beef flavor.

I was so excited and wanted to love it!! But I think there was too much focus on being trendy and 'fake healthy' and not enough focus on treating the food with love and making those carefully sources ingredients shine.

It was packed, but the wait was short and servers/hostess were polite and warm. Service was fast until it was time to get the check."}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I stopped in on a road trip craving something that felt like home. We ALL chose the grilled cheese with tomato soup. HIT the spot. Delicious in every way - loved the goat cheese sprinkled on top of the tomato soup. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Holy bad service, Batman!  The server didn't even know beers by name. Only by number on the menu. She also didn't know that the aoli is basically mayo and garlic when she said there's no mayonnaise in the aoli. Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Townhall for a late lunch today and loved the experience! The patio is one of the best I've ever seen - so many fresh plants and flowers! I also enjoyed their 38-tap beer menu. The server gave me two great beer recommendations and was very attentive. I decided to order two apps as my meal: the sweet potato skins and chicken nachos. Both were excellent, especially the skins. I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! We had a party of four and everyone bought appetizers! Everything that we ordered was excellent and well seasoned. It was our first time in Cleveland and the first restaurant we tried. Excellent choice! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place offers good food, good drinks, great crowd and great service!  A recipe for a great night."}
{"text":"You really feel like you are a part of the city when you come here. 
The patio is very nice. All the decorations and tables inside
really go together and present a sharp cool city look.
Great design!
The bar is something else too! And I liked how it was
long and had a lot of seating. Yet there were places you could still
walk up to and order a drink without pushing thru
people sitting at the bar. 
The food was pretty decent. Not your typical bar food.
No wings on the menu.
The rice bowl I had was good if just a little dry.  
But very flavorful including the tofu.
Was told the buritto was good. Excellent tortilla chips.
Beer on tap - mucho. The best deal is Old Style draft,
for the price. 
Very comfortable atmosphere and the service
was good. 
Excellent outdoor seating. Yes, check
this cool joint out!"}
{"text":"I feel like the places you go all the time but found you haven't reviewed are somehow the hardest. We are regulars of Monday night's $3 draft/vegan night. You can't beat great beer for $3 (the whole list!) and even though I'm not vegan, the food on that menu is outstanding and I always order from it. The vegan chili is my go-to favorite. 

I'm also a big fan of their veggie pastas -- they have a spaghetti squash and a zucchini noodle pasta that are great! The soup/grilled cheese bar combo is always a good choice, as well. 

I would pass on their brunch and I would personally pass if it's after 8 pm on a weekend. It turns from a restaurant into a scene I don't enjoy. But maybe I'm a nana."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday around 1:00pm - it was packed, but the wait wasn't too long (about 25 mins). I tried the sausage and biscuits - loved the sausage gravy and biscuits were sweet and delicious. Mimosas were good - I had orange and grapefruit. Waitress was friendly and service was quick for a busy day. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here.    The wait for a table was quite long, nearly 2 hours on a weekday.   That is what the is preventing me from giving this a 5. 

Good beer selections.  The unfried chicken sandwich was awesome.   I definitely recommend that for an option."}
{"text":"I love this place! It gets really busy sometimes but its because they have great food! Their food is beyond delicous! They also have a really nice patios and a whole section of beers!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar and restaurant. Great beer list. Good cocktail list. Food is pretty damn good too. We shared the Korean BBQ flatbread and it was great. We also had the guacamole with goat cheese. Couldn't detect the goat cheese. It probably just made the guac creamier. We sat outside for one of the last warm-ish nights. Winter is coming."}
{"text":"The so-so meal wasn't worth the 90 minute wait. The veggie burger was very flavorful, but was on the cold, mushy side of the texture spectrum and I wouldn't get it again. If you want to try this place, just order takeout and skip the annoying crowd."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was amazing, drinks were great, and service was immaculate. Love coming here! Even through they were busy they were still on top of it! Their food is healthy and delicious!!! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good as expected (Thai peanut bowl, Veggie burger and Grain fed), but (still) don't understand their seating methodology.  Waited over 30 minutes while empty \"reserved\" tables just sat there or were use to seat late arrivers .  At a place that doesn't take reservations. Wanted Market Garden but they were closed for Labor Day."}
{"text":"This is an ambitious place. Big space, large menu with lots of trendy healthy buzzwords all over it but after my lunch today I am not sure they have the execution to back everything up. Flavors should have all been better. 

Good service and ambiance though."}
{"text":"Amazing high quality food! Thoroughly enjoyed eating here and will definitely return several times. The food is incredible quality, well made and delicious. I had the grilled cheese with bacon and tomato bisque when I came and it was sooooo good. Cooked perfectly, with awesome sourdough and the tomato bisque is one of the best I've ever had. Their desert menu is small but the skillet cookie hits the spot if you have a sweet tooth. Definitely would recommend giving it a go! Reasonable prices and awesome location/restaurant ambience. Great place for work meetings too."}
{"text":"Monday is $3 for all drafts and is the best deal in the city. I now look forward to Mondays. Townhall has a rotating beer list with exciting stuff. I prefer bars with clientele like that of Tick Tock Tavern. If you shower semi-regularly and have most of your teeth, you are automatically one of the best looking and eligible candidates at Tick Tock and feel like Brad Pitt. When I step into Townhall, I am one of the bummiest and grimy people off rip like Brad Armpitt. I can swallow my pride because the draft selection can hang with the best in the city. It is a fine place to have a couple drinks when not at the peak hours. $5 for any draft beer is a great deal even if it is a 8 oz pour. This weekend they had Founders Imperial Stout on the menu. Yesterday was the day that all of the McNulty bars shut down for employee appreciation. I walked by each of them and remarked to a passerby, \"Damn! All these bars are closed!\" to which he replied \"That one is open\" and pointed across the street to ABC. I said \"Yeah, I can't go into that one!\" and noticed Townhall was open. I still don't like all the yuppies that hang here."}
{"text":"Although my friend really liked his pasta dish and I thought my scallops were very nicely seared and tasted good, dinner wasn't really the star for me.  I loved my freshly made juice!  It's pretty rare to find a restaurant that serves food with fresh ingredients and also makes fresh juice!  I had the green thumb (kale, celery, apple) and my friend had the ABC (apple, beet, carrot) and both were very good.  This happened to be during my obsession with juicing so I could tell they actually made fresh juice and that this wasn't a juice blend or some bottled product.  The bonus part - I think this restaurant donates to the cleveland food bank also.

One that doesn't really fit the profile of this place is their dessert menu.  Pretty limited selection and definitely nothing to rave about.  Also, the waiter got our order wrong and charged us for an extra entree (which we neither ordered nor received).  If not for our astute review of the check, we wouldn't even know we got charged extra!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch on a Saturday. It was terrible. Terrible service. Terrible food. I got the eggs Benedict which was made with these thin slimy eggs that were not poached but looked fried. My husbands eggs were sitting in nasty vinegar water. Overpriced and loud. The only hung I enjoyed was the juice/smoothie menu. I don't think I will ever come back here and I don't understand why anyone does."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Never had a bad meal, drink or service. Their bacon is magical."}
{"text":"yeah i dont know about it... to many people i guess maybe i'm to old (36) and just want to relax. This place is to big and to loud. Cant sit down for hours and after all that the food wasn't over the top great.Service was blah. I'm getting to the point in my life that bad service doesn't deserve a tip,  busy or not its your job not mine .  I'd rather be in a dive bar with a good beer and a good bartender"}
{"text":"Townhall is a great restaurant with a great purpose: serving great food exactly how it's meant to be served. With my active lifestyle, it's hard to find a fast casual restaurant with a healthy menu and a great ambience. But at Townhall, I can have all three! The service is fast and friendly, the menu is 100% GMO free and they are extremely accommodating with any dietary restrictions that one may have. The restaurant is also very modern. My first time there I tried the Paleo Tenders. The Paleo tenders were (in addition to being super healthy) super tender and moist and paired great with the siracha aioli! They were served with sweet potato chips that I literally could not stop eating. Amazing. For dessert I got a skillet cookie that melted in my mouth and was so good with the vanilla ice cream. Overall, Townhall is definitely my go-to in the Cleveland area for a very reasonably priced craft beer and a healthy dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch menu items. Variety of food, shakes, smoothies - not to mention full bar for your enjoyment as well. The staff is friendly and attentive. The service was fast, but the food was made with thought and care. 

I had the southern comfort, which was 2 homemade buttermilk biscuits w/ sausage gravy, rosemary and aioli potatoes, a poached egg and a side of bacon. 

I would recommend this place for brunch to everyone, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Townhall is one of my favorite restaurants in the ohio city and tremont area. The menu offers many healthy food options. My favorite are the tacos and grilled cheese. The chicken fingers are also extremely delicious. The restaurant also is aware of food allergies and tries to accommodate. I highly recommend Townhall. Townhall is also a good place to have drinks with friends as well. The environment is awesome and there is a back patio for warmer nights."}
{"text":"Townhall used to be our Westside go to as you really can't find a better menu featuring some unique options that are so dietary accommodating. Even if you're not on a restricted diet, the food has consistently been mixed with fresh flavors and quality ingredients. 

Our son loves the balloon and kid pack in addition to a pretty solid kids menu that features food that is actually decent tasting. This is one of the main reasons we keep coming back.

The wait system though has failed us the past three trips. We've been quoted 30-60 minutes which is fine considering the place, but the reality is usually 60 minutes beyond what is quoted. Two visits ago we were there at 6:00pm on a Thursday and quoted 7:15pm. At 7:15pm, they said we sill had another 60 minutes. This continued until 8:30pm where we just grabbed food from the cafe. While our next few visits were not as dramatic a wait, it was still beyond the quoted time. 

There are a lot of great options in this neighborhood for food. Townhall is specific in the non-gmo area and really has some great meals, so if you're willing to wait it out, at least try it once."}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for brunch, lunch or dinner or a night out with friends, Townhall is THE PLACE to be.  The food is delicious, healthy, fresh and high quality (I recommend the pizza or Thai peanut bowl) and the ever changing craft beer list will keep you coming back for more. The outdoor patio is one of the larger ones in the Cleveland area. If you're looking for refreshing beverages Ari, Anya, Erin and Dijana will hook you up and can mix drinks with the best of em. Want good table service? (Who doesn't?!) Ask for Therese or Rebecca! 

*Would recommend going here 10 out of 10 times*"}
{"text":"Try the home made ginger ale. Everyone at my table loved it. 

I had some sort of rice concoction and it was  good.

Great restaurant, fantastic atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"All I can say is this is one of the best places for brunch in the Cleveland area.  Like, for real though.  I am a HUGE fan of brunch and Townhall kills it!  The vegetarian chili and veggie burger are two of my favorites but no matter what, I always order a sweet potato pancake....do it because it's incredible.  The drinks are really good too and while it's always been packed, we've never had an issue with anything!!"}
{"text":"Townhall is pretty neato. I like all the menu options and huge variety of foods they dish. They have tacos, they have poke bowls, they have burgers- WHAT CAN'T THEY DO? The interior is some ultra cool combination of rustic, hip, and modern - and it works well together. There is plenty of seating and that outdoor patio will definitely be calling my name come spring and summer. The brunch menu is unique as well, with plenty of options for the meat AND plant eater. This place is too legit to quit and I love it. 

\"You said all that nice stuff, why not 5 stars, Colleen?\" Well, if you must know, I wish their drink prices were a little better (wine prices = ridic) and I think that their portions are kinda chintzy. For example, the Smashed Avocado with chips (which is DE-LISH btw) comes with about a measuring cup (*or less) of avo smash, and then enough chips for about 3x the portion they provide. The ratio was just way off. I've noticed this on a few other things I've ordered before as well. Also, I can't just go throwing out 5 stars all willy-nilly on here. What would that say about my standards? Would you even read my reviews anymore?! I just can't take that risk."}
{"text":"We popped into Market Garden, err, Town Hall just post happy hour on Friday(the metaphysical happy hour of course, because it does not exist price wise on the weekend). There was valet service. Are you kidding me? Why did an area that formerly played host to beat up El Dorados and vagrancy skip right past the \"cool\" vibe of an Austin or Philly and dive headlong into wannabe LA yuppiedom? One of my gripes with the resurgence of metro Cleveland. We went right for the wallet(30 dollar parking downtown) without any reputation to warrant such prices. Oh well. It was very crowded, noisy and not air conditioned inside. Otherwise known as my worst nightmare. Luckily, our party of ten or so was on the patio. A patio in the trendy style of a German bier garden, which has pretty much been done to death all over a nation just discovering that we can actually spend some time away from giant tv's with sports on them. It was nice and cool even on a humid mid 80's evening. There was a very chic private tent with couches and a handsome wall installation of pebbles. A nice space for sure, even if it looks just like every other one on the street.

The beer list, impressive! No, just kidding. Can beer lists even be impressive any more? Practically every bar now has like at least 30 taps and every bottled beer allowable by the FDA to be imported. The Winking Lizard was really the trend setter in this regard and gets very little credit for it. Anyhow, the wife and I ordered rye limeades. One basil, one some other crap. It was very refreshing, but I hardly tasted any booze. I had the UBIQUITOUS truffle oil-rosemary fries. Didn't Michael Symon invent those like ten years ago? They were delicious, if not pioneering. My wife had the skillet cookie. It was served in a cast iron vessel with a big scoop of home made ice cream. This was the star of the evening, as several people ordered it throughout the night. Service was actually pretty tight for such a busy hour. Price point for the four items came in at about 20 bucks. Decent I guess. Call me jaded or a pessimist. Cleveland has longed for such great, hip outdoor gathering places for the better part of my life. It's too bad we're so behind the curve compared to the rest of the world. But better late than never, right? I would totally go back. I don't know about in the winter(September thru May in the CLE+). First impression was favorable. And it also eschewed all the awful corporate trappings that have currently engulfed Detroit road here in Lakewood. So points for that. Sorry, this heat just makes me bitchy."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go if you're looking for a happening scene and lots of varieties of beer. Our group wandered in because literally every other place we tried was not open, and we'd heard some good things. We were seated quickly enough and given some time to look over menus. Service was not particularly friendly, but was otherwise impeccable - our drinks arrived in a timely manner, as did our food. It was relatively busy for lunch, so awesome job on that! 
The portions for beer were on the smaller side, which was sort of off-putting. 3 out of the 4 of us were disappointed with our food - two of us had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, one the chicken sandwich, and one a Thai peanut bowl. The Thai peanut bowl was a smashing success, and the tomato soup was good. The grilled cheese sandwiches sort of smelled like homemade play-dough. The chicken sandwich wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really all that good either. There was a coffee drink that was also not really the best. 
Another reviewer mentioned that it seemed like the Applebee's of Ohio City, and I didn't think they were too off the mark. Again, if it's what you're looking for, awesome - I see this place has a ton of rave reviews, which they no doubt deserve! It just wasn't the place for us."}
{"text":"How I've been here so much but never tried a Monday Vegan night I'm not sure. I finally got the chance and can report the vegan food is just as flavorful and fresh as the rest of the menu items. I tried the Black Bean Quinoa Falafel Wrap. For just $7 the portion size was filling and the accompanying plantain chips were a nice light, slightly salty side that went great with the wrap. 

Normally I'm stuck in a rut and order the same thing when I go out; one or two favorite dishes per restaurant. Having stopped in here with different friends and family so much the past few weeks though I've been trying new things. Each dish has been really great and something I can feel good about eating as I try to maintain a healthy diet. 

One new recommendation is the Zucchini \"Pasta.\" The \"pasta\" is a zucchini noodle and the sauce is light and flavorful. If you are having a pasta craving, but want to be good about your diet, this is a great tasting way to meet your needs. TH can go big too. After 5p try the updated lamb entree. Surprisingly for just one Jackson you get tender rather lean lamb coated in cashews and covered in a mustard based sauce with a sweet potato and bacon hash. And while the presentation has changed and Vegan Chili has been poured on top, the Chicken Nachos appetizer is just as good as ever - if not better.  

While TH may be nearing the old age of three it keeps reinventing itself to stay as relevant as ever. For always fresh and consistently cooked healthy food try something new next time you stop in here. And sit outside if you can. I recently got to hang out on the patio for the first time. For its location, it's a more serene dinner atmosphere than one would think. TVs and gas fire pits complete the vibe."}
{"text":"I am currently addicted to Townhalls keto bowl with the cauliflower rice and tuna. It's an amazing flavor sensation! Spicy, savory, fresh and zesty, it's amazing. I have tried to convince my boyfriend to go there every night this week, I may officially have a problem, haha. My only complaint is how popular and busy this place always is. But it's not really a surprise based on how this places exceeds tastebud expectations time and time again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing, well priced, fresh. The cafe side is great if you bring your kids, the bar side is amazing to get together with friends after work. Love the menu, love the food, love the drinks. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Stop in the town hall after our monthly trip to the West Side Market had a nice apple cider on draft and ordered up for brunch menu which was quite interesting and definitely not Bob Evans like I order the southern comfort which was awesome my partner ordered the boots shut up what she said was okay but the proscito was sliced too thick. Our friends ordered and they said they were outstanding so definitely will be back to town hall"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying there were a lot of pros and cons to Townhall. 
Let's start with the cons:
Being our first time in Cleveland, were told we HAD to go to Townhall and have a bloody mary, that they were the best! We ventured to W 25th on Saturday evening and found a spot at the bar. My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and the bartender literally scoffed at us and said \"Pfft! Maybe if it was a Saturday or Sunday Morning! Not 8:00 at night!\", and just left it at that... We ended with a Miller and a cider, no big deal. Another bartender mentioned to ours that he had a crappy drink order come in, and our guy said \"Let me guess, each girl wants a different cocktail? I hate when they do that!\". Not the biggest deal, but what happened next ties into that convo. There was a younger girl and her mom next to us at the bar. They asked our bartender what cocktail he recommends, he replied with \"Well, I'm a grown 34 year old man, so I don't drink cocktails. I drink beer.\". The women were visably confused and then asked him what was popular, and he said \"Well, do you want to think for yourselves? Or do you what everyone else does?\". I mean, come on! The bar has a specialty cocktail menu (that looked delicious, btw), and the guy is being an ass hole over someone asking for a suggestion?! If I'm not mistaken, that's part of being a bartender, right?! We finished our one drink and decided to find a place a little more relaxed.
We decided to give it another try and came back the next morning for brunch. Ya know, so we could get that bloody mary. We put in our names and were told it would be 25-35 minutes... We ended up waiting well over an hour to be seated. We understand it was slammed from brunch and didn't mind waiting, but the time estimate was waaaay off. Once seated, our server came over immediately and got our drink order, and those came out within 2 minutes. My mimosa was made with fresh squeezed orange juice and was the perfect ratio of juice/ champs. And the bloody mary... made with gin instead of vodka and house made bloody mary mix... it was good. However, our food was delicious! I chose the Southern Comfort:  2 Buttermilk biscuits, house made sausage gravy, rosemary potatoes and subbed avocado for the poached egg. My boyfriend got the Wakey Wakey with an over easy egg, sausage and a biscuit. Everything was fresh and full of flavor! The only thing we both didnt care for, was the raw sugar on top of the biscuits, because personally we like them to be more savory than sweet. 

Overall, Townhall has incredible fresh food, and a beautiful venue to eat it in. The long wait and rude bartender aside, I would definitely recommend Townhall to anyone who asked. And we look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"I love Townhall. Only place I go where I feel good eating virtually anything on the menu. Today bone broth and the Keto Bibi something bowl, fabulous. Our server, Kate G could not have been better, friendlier or more engaged. Love it here."}
{"text":"Deliciousness all around! Started with the jade 10 sugar cane drink I loved it and my friend had the jade with gin. The rotisserie chicken nachos yum! For dinner tomato soup with grilled cheese the waiter asked if I wanted to add bacon, prosciutto, or avocado I said \"yes\" and got all 3 so yummmmy! As others have mentioned the Bangkok bowl was a party in your mouth. Finally the grass fed Kobe beef burger with truffle matchstick fries was a hit as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from Las Vegas and were taken here by her Uncle and I appreciate his decision.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty darn cool!  Garage door front was open and a nice breeze was blowing in.  The music playlist was awesome!  :) The staff was exceptionally friendly which I found very refreshing.  Just being nice goes a really long way and it made dinner way better because of it.  OK...the meal was fantastic due to the quality ingredients.  You may be able to order certain things on the menu at another place but I guarantee you that it will not taste like it does here at this place!  Wish we had a place like this in Nevada!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their Menu. I love the Thai chicken bowl they have. I get the sauce on the side(Even though its freaking amazing) but I cant usually finish the whole thing so it makes for great left overs. 

Have you had their brunch? Great! Their tacos are amazing and the crepe station is insane.  How nice is it to go to a restaurant that offers fresh gourmet coffee instead of old stale coffee that was probably microwaved! 

Did I mention the Patio?  Is it spring yet? I'm dying to get outside and enjoy nature while sipping on a delicious craft cocktail! While I do that my boyfriend usually like to see how many of their beers he can try in one visit. Makes for a long day but who would even notice because TH has cards against humanity that keeps our crew busy for hours.  Thank god their bourbon selection is out of this world because I don't know about you but after a couple cocktails, it is very enjoyable to sip on some good bourbon!

Service is pretty good! They make you feel like more of a friend than a customer which I thoroughly enjoy! 

I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great food, a large craft beer selection, a lively atmosphere or even a relaxing cup of joe!"}
{"text":"We stop by the hostess station as we walk in...she says all tables are FCFS at 10p...it's 1005p. We sit at a table. Hostess #2 comes over and says we cannot sit there because they have a reservation for this table. It's now 1016...no people at reserved table. Hostess keeps coming over telling everyone they cannot sit there. Very rude. If you have a policy...stick to it. I don't care if your friends are coming at 10 and need a place to sit...I'm here with my friends at 10 and we are sitting here...per your policy."}
{"text":"I just ate here and the food and atmosphere were fantastic!  I loved my waitress and was greeted by the owner.
My meal was perfect, very reasonable prices and i just felt it was a great choice of places to go!"}
{"text":"Townhall is great. I went for lunch on a random Thursday and was surprised to find a pretty decently sized lunch crowd, good atmoshpere. The bar is HUGE so me and my out of town friend grabbed a seat. The bartender was pretty friendly and recommended some good local beers. I don't remember the exact dish I ordered, but it was one of their asian inspired ones, thai peanut something, and I loved it. Had a few more drinks and carried on down to some other W 25 street spots before an Indians game. Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"To be honest for a long time I thought Townhall was overrated until I relocated my office to W 25th in December of 2017.  This place continously impress with their tasty/trendy/healthy menu options coupled qith a ridiculously awesome beer selection on tap.  Currently they have me sold on the KetoBowl with steak or tuna!"}
{"text":"It can be a good place for large groups and it definitely has it's flair. There is a good amount of both outdoor and indoor seating. It's gotten bad PR because of its sponsorship of conservative campaigns while still trying to bring in the liberal Millennial crowd in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good mod atmosphere and up a notch food.  No GMOs is a huge benefit.  I ate off the vegan options and my food was good!  Nothing crazy special but for Cleveland, great vegan options!  

I did go twice while in town.  Prior to other reviews I had no wait time trouble- yet I didn't go on weekend nights.  Went during early afternoon both times and no problem being sat immediately.

Ordered the mushrooms and cauliflower off the small rectangle menu they have you and they were bomb ! (Cooked in avocado oil and organic)

Had tacos with beyond meat chicken with fries, the zucchini pasta with vegan chicken as well as the peanut sauce rice bowl with tofu (which was prepared in such a manner that it wasn't icky soggy, nice firm dry tofu).

My daughter had almond butter and jelly on sourdough off the kids menu and the vegan salted caramel milkshake which was awesome.

Service was nice but absolutely nothing special.  Had a couple questions that she didn't really know the answers to let alone go ask and find out.  But hey I know how it goes, been in the industry for a long time so I said no worries and just dropped the questions as opposed to prolong our experience.  They did seem to chat up at the host stand quite a bit but were all friendly and did their job when required haha.

Overall pretty great would definitely return but they will up their game in the future of Vegan options I'm sure ."}
{"text":"Cool place but service leaves something to be desired.  Bar tender walked by ignoring us until I shouted.  She said \"I'm not your waitress\" and I had to shout to get our server who never showed up.  

Cool vibe and music but either they are Making so much they don't care or their service is poorly supervised.  Once this place loses the new moniker they'll need service to survive."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience here... From enjoying a wide selection of craft beers to their succulent scallops!  They are helping to build the new age of nightlife bars by offering gourmet dishes instead of the typical fried foods. Scallops have to be the best thing on the menu, and maybe the best in town!  They are large scallops cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with and corn and prosciutto side. At a price of $17, you really can't go wrong!  I have also had the spicy curry noodle bowl which is also very flavorful.

One of my favorite things about Town Hall is their craft beer selection. And everything is always $5!  So there's no need to question it!  To make it better, Mondays it's only $3 for any craft beer draft!

Also, the patio is quite amazing in the warmer months. The bar has a completely open feel as you can see right through from the front patio of the bar to the back patio of the bar when they open up both garage doors. Even on chillier days, they have patio heaters and an outdoor firepit table!

In order to get a table, you do have to see the hostess, as opposed to taking an open table as you see fit. Although this is a spacious bar with plentiful seating, it does get very crowded!  So this method does make it fair for those who have been waiting for a table.  They have plenty of waitresses and bartenders on staff also, so service is always very good!

Bonus: Town Hall is a highly philanthropic organization and donates a lot of it's proceeds to local charities. I am a strong believer that the community will thrive depending on the businesses and residents within them, and businesses can only thrive with the support of the community. So having this partnership, where the business recognizes the importance of the community it serves and gives back to them will only help to build a stronger city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here on a Saturday morning for brunch. We came in at about 1045 and there was a 15-20 min wait (a lot of tables were reserved), but the bar was first come first serve and we were able to find a spot right away. We both had bloody Mary's to start which were delicious, very unique flavors of cucumber, dill, and just enough spice. I ordered the egg sandwich with pickled onion, spinach, cheese, and their bacon which was phenomenal. He picked the eggs benedict and that was very good as well. Both dishes were served with their rosemary potatoes and the entire dish was a considerably large portion. Their crepe bar looked also looked amazing so that is definitely my next visit. The staff did a great job, food came out fresh and fast, and the atmosphere was super fun with a magician and balloon animalst walking around too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. We stopped in tonight for a bite to eat a drink and to see the Tribe game. Well it is a Monday night 8:15pm and it's not to busy after waiting 10 minutes for a hostess to even acknowledge us we get seated and our server comes by and goes over the specials. So I order a drink that she said they had and she comes back to inform me they didn't have it so I try again and that didn't work so we finally find a cocktail that they have and we order them. After about 20 to 25 minutes or cocktails finally come out mind you it is not that busy. So we order our food in the meantime our drinks finally came and let me tell you it felt like I was drinking pure gasoline it was a very strong martini almost to the point of not enjoyable. So if you minutes later our food comes out and my wife loved hers so that's a plus but me in the other hand my chicken sandwich was terrible Way overseas and the bun was soggy my French fries were cold I took 2 bites and was just over it.  After we got our meals it was almost impossible to get the waitress to come back at that point I was already frustrated and just wanted to go home and end of the night. So lo and behold I get my tab pay it and we left and I don't think I will ever return there nor send a new one to try it."}
{"text":"I've had drinks and light dinner here, lunch take out and afternoon coffee. The atmosphere always seems to be the same. They've got a delicious chilled espresso that I love. I thought the smashed avocado was a overpriced. But overall it's always been a nice experience and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I haven't had a meal at Townhall I didn't like. The burgers are always juicy and the fries are never stale. Their new chicken sandwich has all the right seasons. And I'm Jamaican, so I definitely like my spices.

I really like the appetizers, I wish they had an option to combine appetizers into a meal because they're that good. I Recommend the potato skins, the chicken nachos and the DATES! (I'm actually getting hungry while I write this)

But we can't forget the skillet cookie! A cookie the size of a plate, made to perfection topped with world famous Mitchell's ice cream. (What can be better than that?)

Brunch!
As good as their food is during normal hours, nothing beats a TH brunch. My buddy and I try to make it to TH a few Saturday's out of the month for brunch. He likes the açaí bowl and the avocado on toast. I prefer the \"wakey wakey\", which is a biscuit, bacon and eggs. The biscuits are what I describe as the sweet equivalent version of the cheddar biscuits at red lobster. The eggs are dope, but the bacon is what sets Townhall apart from other restaurants. Quarter inch thick bacon, looks like a mini steak. And whatever they glaze it with makes my mouth water just thinking of it. 

But brunch gets pretty packed so get there early if you want to find a seat."}
{"text":"Great concept! Some of the dishes are great for brunch! Their stuffed dates are awesome!"}
{"text":"Im not a fan of this place, for reasons not to be announced. I do however like how much attention and the huge crowds it stirs up. It leaves places I like to go such as Bier Market and Market Garden a lot less packed with douchebags by containing them all in this place.

Foods not too bad, I cant even lie. A little pricey, but whats cheap these days, right?
So, if you just got doe watching Jersey Shore, went out and bought the same outfit your favorite moron on the show had on, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, quick turn around of food, and delicious food! Townhall is doing it right!  LOVED all the vegan options and the price point.  Super awesome atmosphere and I appreciated the late night menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Good service. Awesome vibe. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in CLE!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Can be hard finding consistently good healthy food. It's always delicious! Never disappoints."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable, from their exotic beer selection to the food, this place was fun. Town Hall's atmosphere is very energetic, hipster crowd and it's an amazing place to visit, have drinks & eat. The beer menu gets 5 stars from me since they have some really hard to find craft beers right on draft! The food is very good from what I had (this was my first time and it was only the brunch menu) My meal was portioned to a healthy amount and I was full after my meal. The food is all \"real\" no GMO's also include Gluten free options so if you're somebody looking for a health centric restaurant this is a great place to go. Town Hall does get pretty busy during all hours of the day so plan on at least having a 10-20 minute wait but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of the land!  Seriously I'd drive 3 hours every weekend for their food (especially the sweet potato skinks). Their truffle fries are amazing too!  I'm going to try brunch my next visit!!

Great selection of beers and their mixed drinks have amazing names  the Pine needles mixed drink is my favorite of all time!!

Parking is easy behind the building.  The atmosphere is great!!  They are always busy so expect to wait a few, or sit at the bar!!!"}
{"text":"OMG--yum. One of my favorite places here in CLE for anything and all things. The fact that they have such a fantastic organic and non GMO menu is amazing and it is the best place to eat. The paleo night is the best time to go for the chorizo peppers and the Portobello caps as they are divine. My kids love going to the brunches and live for Sweet Potato Hotcakes. This is absolutely a young and lively place filled with the hipster crowd that we all know and love. So good! It is beautiful inside and the staff is so fresh faced and adorable. Love coming here so much!"}
{"text":"My first review was pre-opening.

Now that it's open (and has been for a while), I'm a happy camper!

Ok, so to quickly address the issue that it's seen as the downfall of Ohio City.  I disagree.  It offers something that is not McNulty'ized, and with good service, good food and decent prices, it's become VERY popular.  Sure, some of these people are \"suburban\", but hey, it's not nearly as bad as Barley House, so stop your complaining!

Back to my review,
I've been to Townhall about a dozen times now.  Every time, I've consistently had good service, a good view of the TV and been pleased with my meal.  I'm also a big fan of their $5 beer offerings and they even have Old Style on the menu!  

Some of my favorites: The Flatbread, the Tomato bisque, the Avocados/Goat cheese App, and just last week I was turned onto the Vegie burger...it was great!  We've ordered many things off the menu and no one has ever been disappointed.  

I would like to also point out that the Bistro side offers a great and quick option - it's exactly the same but without the waitress service.  

Townhall is now one of my favorite spots along W. 25th.  It's as close to a sports bar as you'll find, and the food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"Come here if you're vegan (especially if you like spicy food) and/or bewr, they'll hook your ass up!"}
{"text":"I was in heaven.  I only went once, which isn't a true indication of how well a restaurant is doing.  But for their menu and taste alone they deserve the good review.  Anyone that is offering such a diverse, healthy and well thought out menu deserve props....We loved our meal and the staff was very friendly.  We waited 15 minutes for a party of 7 on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here during the winter and the outside is a nice area to relax and have a few brews. Didn't really explore inside, but service and atmosphere was great on the outside. Prices are decent as well!"}
{"text":"Still going good. I wanted to review the cafe. I've bee hitting it up lately for some Jo. Because it's great coffee. And the atmosphere is better than the chains imo. It s nice transition I can get an amazing coffee and the get an amazing beer with out having to step outside. Kewl."}
{"text":"Not only is the food incredibly delicious, it's healthy for you too. The presentation of the food looks like culinary works of art. I drive an hour and 10 minutes from the Youngstown area to come here to eat. There are a lot of good restaurants in Cleveland, but the Townhall is where I gravitate to most.  Did I mention the food at the Town Hall is 100% GMO free?!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and I got Townhall via a third party delivery service (deliverme food.com.) I got.... 

Spaghetti squash bolognese: 
Super yummy! It's nice and FRESH. Comes with a poached egg, which was such a nice surprise. It was like Christmas morning when I realized, y'all. Now, I've never had spaghetti squash before, and I've always wanted to try it. I liked it a lot! However, this dish isn't really comparable to a \"normal\" pasta dish, it's more of a stew. The sauce is wonderful, it has brightness, hardiness, and a nice kick. Love that you get chunks of the smoky Kobe beef in 100% of the bites. Thank you, Townhall for not being stingy! 

Truffle fries: 
Standard, crispy, there was truffle oil, there were fries. Aioli was good. Was not disappointed nor was I amazed. I would recommend them. 

Though I didn't actually walk in to the restaurant and experience any face to face service, the one phone call I had was telling. The girl was very pleasant and helpful! 

Overall, COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Every time I go there it's so packed I can't even get a drink. Their beer selection is good though"}
{"text":"town hall always impresses. We went for brunch and the vibe was great listening to Nate Jones play live music on the patio. We had the Thai peanut bowl, and street truck tacos. Drink were so fresh and service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, get the skillet cookie for dessert. It's excellent. However, that was the only good part of the meal. I got the tofu tacos. The toppings were great but the tofu was dry - how the chef managed to make dry tofu I'll never understand. My boyfriend got the salmon entree, which showed up to the table 15 minutes after everyone else at the table received their food (there were 6 of us all together). It also came with a ginger dressing that you were supposed to pour over it that the under-attentive waitress never told him to do. It definitely would have made the food much better. 

Will go back, but only for the skillet cookie."}
{"text":"A great, unique hang out in the heart of West 25th. Great food and service. A short walk from the West Side Market."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit. Friendly people working there. It was a very very busy Saturday night, so it took a little while to get a table. I have a friend who is vegetarian and gluten free and they were able to accommodate her. I went the veggie route myself and had the curry bowl with tofu, it was really good.

I would definitely go back there again. Maybe try to hit it during the week when less crazy."}
{"text":"So disappointed by my recent experience at Townhall. I have enjoyed the food and beer selection, but the service.........ugh!!! Went to Townhall on Sunday, June 5th to have dinner and hopefully watch the Cavs game on the patio. Now, I realize it is the NBA Finals and there would be a wait, but what I experienced leaves me upset and frustrated. I stopped at the hostess stand, where I have never received a greeting any time I have entered Townhall, and inquired about the wait for the patio. I was informed that they only had to \"wipe down a table and it would be 5 minuites\". Wow! I was completely surprised by the wait time & of course it was too good to be true. After standing by the hostess stand for about 15 minutes, waiting for our \"5 minute table\", the hostess asks if I am waiting for a table. Ummm...yes!!! I proceeded to tell her \"yes, you told me it would be 5 minutes to wipe down a table\". She then tells me \"well let me get your name and put you on the list, should be 15-20 minutes\". Ok....so 5 minutes turns into 20. I get it, it is busy, big game, we will grab a beer and wait. As we head to the bar for a drink, another waitress asks if we would be ok with sitting in the front patio. I tell her \"no, we would actually prefer the back patio\". After about 15 minutes I receive the text from Townhall that our table is ready. Perfect, right on time! Oh wait.........that text was for the front patio, which I said 15 minutes ago that we did not want to be seated at. So now the hostess informs me that it is really a hour wait for the back patio. At this point I am done.There was no apology, no attempt to make it right, nothing. I get being in the customer service industry is trying, but the hostess gives off the impression that she couldn't care less. I have never had such a bad experience trying to get a seat. The lack of communication and hospitality is astounding to me. I'm not asking for VIP treatment or anything close to it, but come on! That being said, we left half our beers on the bar & walked out. Probably won't be back, not because of the menu, but because the staff is incredibly frustrating to deal with."}
{"text":"Never fails. Consistent go-to for fresh, healthy, and phenomenal food. The beer selection is always unreal with a large array of styles to suit the needs of all craft enthusiasts. The bar tender I have now, Steph, I've had before and she and the rest of the staff are very helpful. Great place to come and watch the game or sit and enjoy a few with friends. A must in Cleveland. Cheers."}
{"text":"Love this place, went for drinks last week on a Tuesday night. That place is always crowded!! With the rainy weather, mostly everyone was inside. We went for a few drinks - my mixed drink was amazing, forget the name of it but as I have said before, they are infused and come with a huge ice cube. Our waitress was not very attentive but maybe she was new. The best part was the cookie for dessert with a huge scoop of Mitchell's ice cream! I had been craving Mitchell's all night so when I saw it on the menu it was great. Definitely worth a visit it you have not been yet!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but noisy and expensive. Not good for business lunch. Parking is hit or miss."}
{"text":"One of the best places to both grab a bite during the day and have a drink at night. Townhall is home to Cleveland's best burger--the grass fed burger. Period. One bad thing about Townhall is that they don't take reservations for dinner. The service is still really good!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it out to Townhall! My friend and I were both off on Valentine's day- why give single people the day off on that day- they're just going to day drink their sorrows away!! Which is exactly what we did. 

We started off at Townhall, craving bloody mary's! I was told they had great ones, but we were NOT fans. It tasted like salsa in a glass with a straw. I like salsa, but not in place of a bloody mary! :-\

We ordered a few apps as well. The veggie flatbread was HUGE and delish!! Kinda greasy, but super delish. I was imagining we would get something small, but out came 6 BIG square pieces of delish cheesiness! We also ordered the smashed avocados - aka guacamole and chips. The guac was alright - it was very heavy on the lime! My favorite was the lettuce wraps!! Their chili garlic sauce was AMAZING - i kept dipping my flatbread crust in it!! But, the chicken strips were well seasoned, the bib lettuce was fresh and crisp, the sauces were delish, and I loved the pickled carrots! YUM!!!!

The service was fine- we sat at the bar and there weren't TOO many people in our area so service was pretty fast and the bartender was friendly and talkative! We got a few drinks after the bloody mary's - vodka drinks and beer. the beer list is pretty awesome. Beer from different states that you may not be able to find elsewhere around here... vodka drinks were inconsistent... one was super strong and the next was REALLY dilute.... :-\

I can't believe my nights out in Ohio city haven't brought me here - but now that I finally went, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Recently, I wanted to make a reservation for dinner.  We were a party of 15 people and Townhall accepts reservations for larger parties.  When I called, I was referred to \"Brian\".  I have never talked to someone so inconsiderate and unprofessional.  If you cannot accept my reservation, that's no problem!  I used to work in the restaurant industry and completely understand that.  What I have a problem with is someone treating me as though I am less than them.  He made rude comments about the zip code I was calling from and was not willing to accommodate us another other night (I was willing to be flexible with days and times within a few weeks of my chosen date).  He also said, \"What do you want me to do? Apologize?\".  Someone like this should not be in the service industry.  I wish this call could have been recorded because it was absurd."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is it's quaint atmosphere. Thanks to the large heating lamps the outdoor seating it is comfort even on a cooler day. They have an exceptional menu with a variety of healthy and vegan options. We started with the rosemary and truffle fries, which by the way was to die for! As an entree I got the seared salmon with cauliflower and quinoa. The salmon seemed slightly undercooked but overall the taste was good. For a beverage I ordered the mint matcha with chocolate milk. It's delicious if you like matcha, however I the chocolate taste did not come through for me. Overall I give this place two thumbs up! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Brunch was great loved all the options on the menu. The only downside was we went on a Sunday when there was a Browns game on and it was extremely loud. If I go back it would have to be when there were no big games that would attract a loud crowd."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here it gets better and better. This time I had a small party to celebrate a bday milestone.  All my friends who have never been to Townhall raved about the butternut squash and tomato bisque soup.  The new Lamb Burger was also a hit. Kobe beef burger had a friend who is most dicriminating when it comes to food loving it.  I had the Thai chicken bowl with peanut sauce, very good and addicting.  The specialty drinks had by many of the females in the party recieved positive comments all around.  The beers on tap were well recieved by many first timers especially the Hopslam that I heard was a limited time exclusive.  Service was flawless from the minute we walked in to the minute we left.   Dan I., Ashley, and Brian set up an experience to remember.  It convinced some of my suburbanite friends that Ohio City is worth the trip downtown again."}
{"text":"I'm still a little confused as to what this place is supposed to be.  All I do know is that it was PACKED during my visit.  Holy cow, wall to wall people.  We grabbed beers from one of the stations and elbowed our way outside.  I can see the patio being awesome on a nicer day but we had to huddle away from rain during our visit.  Apparently they also have tables and serve food??? You couldn't prove it by me because all I saw were bodies packed into a room!!  This place looks like it will be a hit!"}
{"text":"Loved all the vegan, vegetarian options on the menu. The Thai peanut bowl was delicious with the right amount of sauce and seasoning. The vegetables were crunchy rather than overcooked. Our waiter Jordan was attentive without being pushy. 

The guacamole was fresh, spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"First I do not really do \"corporate\" restaurants and though they really have organic vegan and healthy options I just think your food has to taste great this a great place in Ohio City Cleveland, Ohio ambiance is a 5 I ordered the Bangkok  Bazaar it was ok not bad just ok I also had the chorizo seared Brussels sprouts ok but not great again I want to knocked of my feet with flavor and taste I finished with the cookie skillet with a scoop of ice cream blah blah anyway great beer selection cold pressed juices and smoothies will try again maybe just ordered the wrong item and will adjust my rating"}
{"text":"Cleveland's newest hot spot for yuppies in their 30's and beer aficionados. I like light beers so would recommend mission blonde, but did fall for the creme brûlée stout or willoughby peanut butter stout! There is ample parking right in the back, with garage style entrance both in front and back. Gorgeous patio with crate and barrel type cabanas and seating. If you are looking to hold an event there is a side area that can be roped off. I am typically there at least once or twice per week, it's a central meeting area and the beer selection is very diverse."}
{"text":"Today my family and I ate at Town hall for the first time. We were at the Taste of Tremont but found it to be too crowded so we left. The atmosphere was great, we were sat in a timely fashion, the food was excellent, and best of all, our server Kathryn was phenomenal! Just wanted to let you know. We'll be back on a Monday for your tofu wings. Thanks, Lori"}
{"text":"It's so stinking cute in here. we didn't eat but boy did we drink! The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the decors and ambiance, otherwise I Wouldn't have given it any.  The bartender was rude and didn't want to answer any questions I had about menu. We ended up leaving and going down to market garden brewery"}
{"text":"Poor management - horrible experience. 
Our party of eight left after waiting after almost 2 hours. 
No reservations on Friday nights, but how does another group get seated when they show up 30 minutes after we do????
Because they are part of the 3-13 Cleveland Clowns. 
We left and enjoyed our 8 dinners at another locally owned restaurant.
Won't be back - ever. (you mirror the poor Browns Management decisions and poor product!)"}
{"text":"For me, the environment wasn't very pleasant or inviting lol. I just felt super awkward there. It took a minute for someone to finally acknowledge me but still made me feel a little awkward. My server (don't remember her name) wasn't very friendly.  I wanted to try something different so I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a Pineapple Mimosa. The drink and the fries were okay but that's about it. Kind of just want to run out of there."}
