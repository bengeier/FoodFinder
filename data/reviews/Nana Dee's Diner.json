{"text":"Nice place. Good atmosphere and nice servers. The eggs and potatoes were great, and the gravy was to die for. Only issue was it was a little greasy and the grease tasted a little old. Very fast service and good breakfast. Will probably come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 for a straight up diner experience... no fine dining here but the waitresses were great and the breakfast was tasty, hot, and filling. The retro atmosphere was fun. I'd recommend this place if your looking for an old school, main street kind of meal."}
{"text":"We just had a delicious breakfast here. My husband had a corn beef omelet with the most delicious home fries. Coffee was hot and tasted great. I had the Mexican omelet with homemade chorizo. The tortilla was homemade too. Great place for breakfast. The service was prompt and our server kept the coffee coming."}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new ownership and I have to say I'm impressed. I had the chicken pot pie which I was told was their best seller. Very tasty and healthy. You don't have to feel guilty when you order this. My husband had the chicken fried steak and it didn't disappoint! The gravy is much improved and the biscuit was very fresh and fluffy."}
{"text":"Sorry,  way too greasy.  Unfortunately i was disappointed at the service and food.  I read positive reviews but the meals were almost inedible.  Also,  clean the bathrooms please."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food, happy servers, especially Val. We had the fish and chips, beef liver, fried chicken, and hamburger for our group. Came back the next day for their famous green chili."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Get the pork green Chile if you come on the weekends. The Irish folk will like the homemade corned beef hash. Very helpful and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Excellent. Wonderfully decorated reminds you of the 50s and 60s. Food was great. Val the waitress was superb and the Meatloaf Sandwich hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Traveling and came across this great little diner. The chicken pot pie is very good, but you should really come here to experience the outstanding retro decorating! Beautiful!"}
{"text":"Replaces the old restaurant (Five and Dine??) exactly.  I like the following:

1.  Veterans discount.
2.  Senior menu with great prices.
3.  Some tasty baklava.
4.  I really like the milk shakes."}
{"text":"I grew up in the land of diners aka New Jersey but out in AZ you don't come across too many diners. We were in the area waiting for my car to come back from the mechanic when we saw Nana Dee's diner. I was not in the mood to cook so we decided to take a shot at it. We walked in to this 50s style diner and were pleasantly surprised. The decor is a cute 50s decor which includes the waitresses with their poodle skirts. I had the redwood sandwich  and my husband had the meatloaf sandwich. It was simple delicious diner food. They run breakfast specials all week and specials on the weekends. Such a cute throwback diner. Glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place, brought my grandkids in for their Mac & Cheese (they love it here).  Great service adorable pricing with a old school Dinner atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went there for a late breakfast.  Although they were not overly busy the service was very slow.  It took a long time to get our food but once it came out it was good.  The waitress was friendly and very helpful, but appeared to be covering a lot of tables. Will probably try it again for lunch this time."}
{"text":"Fun 50's atmosphere! Looks like it used to be a 5 & diner. Food was good except my sausage was a tad bit under cooked. My order came with plenty of other food so I was full anyways! Good service too :)"}
{"text":"Nana Dee's is a great place for old fashioned home cooking diner style. The food was tasty & portions were plenty. It was great to see Val again. Her customer service is welcoming & attentive. 
We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my GF here last Friday. Great diner food! Service was quick and friendly. The breakfast (served anytime) was delicious!
We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Even though we showed up late night Service was super super super friendly.  the food was good and came out fast.  

I don't usually decide on diner food when choosing a place to eat out.  I always opt for something I couldn't easily cook myself at home.  Still, late night after a movie means limited choices & I'm glad we stopped here.  I couldn't have made a better mushroom with melted Swiss hamburger and french fries myself.  If American diner fare is what you're craving try this place,  I don't think I've had better.  We will definitely be going back.

Skip the milkshake, that didn't impress."}
{"text":"Classic diner with stainless steel and red vinyl. Chicken fried steak and pot roast were enjoyable and portions were large. Also, all-you-can-eat fish fry on Friday nights.  Our server was friendly and brisk. Definitely not a snooty place, but good food and prices. Kitchen is quite efficient and our orders came quickly. Nice find in a sea of chain restaurants."}
{"text":"The pancakes were very fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, the meatloaf left a brick in my stomach. The flavor was okay but not great. I liked the mashed potatoes but should've had the gravy on the side. All in all, not bad but not sure we would come back. Service was also good but nothing special."}
{"text":"I hope any criticism is taken positively. We had been coming to the previous establishment for 20 years, and it seriously declined. Very glad to see new ownership. Ordered breakfast and it was good. Service was fast (keep that up!). My home fries could have been better. The larger pieces were a little underdone, and a bit too greasy. Had the pork chili, which relied too heavily on canned peppers. Overall a solid 3 stars, just needs a little improvement"}
{"text":"I've been to this diner twice and definitely intend to go back. Both times the food was very good and the service was excellent. Try to sit in Carrie's section or Val's section. They are super pleasant, didn't make any mistakes, and were great with giving me drink refills before I had to ask."}
{"text":"This was previously a 5 n Diner. Much of the staff has been there for years. Friendly staff quick service. Food is good. Priced as expected. I like this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a themed American 50s diner that was formerly a 5 & Diner building. The menu is basically the same as its previous operator. Quality burgers, fries and shakes. The reason I enjoy it is that it is one of the few places you can get wet fries (fries with gravy) in the Valley. 

The facility is clean and we'll lit and the staff is kind. The food is decent but not surprising. The pace is slow, so sometimes it feels that your order is not in the queue. In fact, on my last visit, they forgot to put the order in- however they did take a discount off the bill due to the mistake and apologized. I wasn't in a hurry that day so it didn't bother me.

The restaurant seems over staffed in the empty afternoon hours, but under staffed for the dinner rush, but that is just my experience.

If you have time and enjoy basic American burger and fries food, this is a good stop."}
{"text":"First time here and loved the place! Food was excellent and our waitress Val was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food!  Good customer service and genuinely nice people.  This is a true-to-form diner, complete with nostalgia photos and posters on the walls and PLENTY of candy apple red and chrome.  Very clean!  I had the 3-egg corned beef hash omelette with hollandaise.  Very good!  I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop in as my wife and I love traditional diners. This place bleeds authenticity. Every inch looks like it is right out of the 50-60s. The staff was friendly and welcoming which is always a great start. We immediately noticed how clean and tidy everything was. 

You might be asking: \"Such good things to say, why only 3 stars?\"

That's a great question. 

While the atmosphere is great and the staff pleasant, the food and price are sub-par. 

For $30 we got a tiny plate of eggs and bacon with some small and burnt pancakes, another small plate of eggs with burnt bacon and small french toast and finally, a moderately sized kids chicken fingers. Hell, the kids meals was the biggest thing. 

To top it all off the eggs were cold as we're the fries. 

Blech, cold eggs. 

We walked out sad and still hungry (except for my kiddo who loved her chicken)."}
{"text":"Our breakfast this morning was delicious I had the ultimate omelette was light and fluffy and full of yummy goodies and my husband of course had his favorite biscuits and gravy and it was delicious as well we will be coming back to Nana Dee's Restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this diner! Staff is friendly and fun, food is wonderful. 
Sometimes its a bit of a wait but worth it!"}
{"text":"Well I cannot tell you enough how perfect my eggs were,delicious bacon and great potatoes, very good biscuit. service was excellent. For $6.29 price it was fantastic...,you could come here every day."}
{"text":"This is a typical diner. Full of grease and deep fried foods. The entrees were subpar to say the least. Even the soda was flat. Not a good choice if looking for good food."}
{"text":"We came here over a month ago to try this place for breakfast, and its since become a unanimous Sunday tradition with my whole family:   This place makes a kick-ass breakfast.  The place is always spotless and the service is fast and really friendly.    Yeah, we love it.      

See you guys again this Sunday."}
{"text":"Val, my waitress, was fantastic and energetic. It was very busy and she stayed upbeat and positive. The food was good, prices are fine, not too expensive. I have to say again that Val rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. I like the vintage look. The food here is good and the portions and prices fit. Great music while we were eating. I'm full and happy and that's exactly how I wanted to feel to start my day."}
{"text":"My husband was thinking 3 out of five. 
Unfortunately we were disappointed. Reading all the reviews we decided to try it anyway. I got the corn beef hash and my husband got the steak omelette. Mine was SO salty! I couldn't hardly eat it. When she brought it out I could see the salt sprinkled on top of it. My husbands omelette was average. He said it was \" safe to eat\". 

Service was so so as we were welcomed in with a smile but once we were sat that was it for hospitality. When our food came back we never saw our server again. 

And lastly, what American doesn't love duct tape, right? 
But I mean if you are trying to get going and have just opened, starting off with everything covered in tape as a permanent fix isn't going to help the \" come and eat here again\" appeal."}
{"text":"Aesthetically it's nice. Food was horrible. Coleslaw was nothing but mayo, med burger cooked to charcoal, server cut open fish and stuck her finger in, got 12 fries with burger for $10.99(rip off), tartar sauce tasted like just relish and it took way too long. The manager was nice but this is unacceptable. He did take everything off the bill but we won't be back. I'm a chef. This was Kitchen Nightmare bad. Then as we still left a tip the server(who was the one who stuck her finger in my fish) said sorry we aren't happy. You shouldn't be happy with this. Sloppy, horrible technique and unsanitary. #epicfail"}
{"text":"If you need a good breakfast at anytime during the day, you go to a diner.  As others have mentioned, it's a former 5 and Diner location, under new ownership.  Nothing has changed at all - still the same oldies diner décor.  I was there for lunch - we were seated promptly and got our drinks, but then it took a while for someone to take our order.   Great diner food - nothing fancy.  The hot food was hot, the cold food was cold.  Great shakes. My friend was not thrilled with his open-faced meatloaf sandwich, but everything else was okay."}
{"text":"This '50s style Diner is quaint and serves up delicious choices. Although we have really only eaten the breakfast  fare, the other meals look delicious as well. We especially enjoy Valerie - she is genuine, courteous and entertaining. She rounded out the experience! I had the Biscuits Eggs and Gravy, very good and comfort-food worthy! If you like waffles - the Lumberjack is filling with the Belgian style waffle, eggs and sausage or bacon. Don't pass up a fresh cup of coffee too!"}
{"text":"We loved the nostalgic feel and the fantastic service. We went for breakfast and the food was so great! THE BEST hash browns!! We will be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Liked the specials available, but won't go back.  First of all, they were not busy!!!
My husband received his coffee immediately,  but I had to remind the waitress twice that she didn't bring my drink. Also, asked for ice water, but there was no ice in the glasses. Our hash browns and bacon were ordered extra crispy and both came soggy and greasy. The potatoes even had an odd smell.  Two $6.29 breakfast specials, one soda and one coffee came to over $19.00!!!! That's expensive drinks!!!  The waitress wasn't overly friendly until we got ready to leave."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service! We had an awesome waitress. Thank you Julie! She really goes above and beyond for us!"}
{"text":"Service was good but food tasted frozen or from a box. Not fresh. My breakfast was super bland no flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing Ruben! Great service. The onion rings are really good aswell, so are the shakes!"}
