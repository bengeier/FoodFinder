{"text":"Im not such a big fan of the meals here, but its a great stop for tea and ice cream."}
{"text":"Just went there for carry out. I am from Chicago and wanted to pick up some food for the travel. They over charged me. When I complained, they checked and realized they had over charged me by $7.50. Imagine overcharging that much on a $30.00 bill. Place was dirty and completely unkept. I woul not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Manpasand definition  Man : Heart Pasand : Like or Desire  So manpasand basically means what your heart desires.   And it explains this little hole in the wall perfectly.  I had to go back again today (after discovering it yesterday) and I tried the take out buffett special (7.49  + free pop)  The guy behind the counter said i could get 5 items for the buffett.  I chose:  1. The chicken biryani - huge portion! filled up half my container with it. Fragrant rice spiced perfectly with different coloured strands of rice :) with two huge pieces of chicken. DELICIOUS.  2. The mutter paneer (you need veggies right?) - I chose this to show my co-worker what Paneer was. It was really good. Your standard peas and paneer (indian cottage cheese) curry.   3. The tandoori chicken - Really really good barbequed chicken! No explanation needed.  4. The chicken tikka - Chunks of chicken breast barbequed with various veggies (onions, peppers and tomatoes). This was really good. Not spicy. But still good.  5. The Fish Pakora - This was a wild card. I'm really squeamish about Fish. I can only really eat it when I'm out for sushi or something. I know, it's weird. Im okay with other seafood (shrimp, lobster, mussels, etc) but just fish is weird to me. I tried this out anyways. ITS EFFING GREAT! OMG. It's deep fried fish in a spicy red batter. Take your avg fish and chips, and kick it up 32423525 notches. I'm hooked.   and it came with free fresh!!!!! naan.  I'm in LOVE with this restaurant.  ps, the kids were there again today. SUPER CUTE.  LOVE  THIS  PLACE."}
{"text":"If you're a carbivore like me, you'll appreciate their savory little packages of potatoes and peas enveloped by delicious fried dough. Regular Samosas (Aloo - potato and pea) are 5/$1 here.   This is definitely a hole in the wall. Dim with the smell of stale incense, I wouldn't dine in. But when I'm in the area and craving for a cheap fried snack, I come here. They fry them up fresh after you order them, dipping sauces are 50 cents extra for a small container. Didn't like their tamarind sauce (red sauce) but the green sauce is spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"I found my tandoori pharmacist.   I get cravings for tandoori anything like no other, and Manpasand hooks me up like it's nobody's business. For those of you who don't know, Tandoori is that kick-ass North Indian clay oven type of barbecue, that will broil and season just about anything; chicken, pork, naan, roti, cauliflower. You name it.   I come here at least once a month to get my fix, and the owner hooks me up right away. My drug? Half a Tandoori Chicken, Raita and lightly buttered Naan. The Chicken is always extremely meaty, juicy, (obviously an exceptionally great job at marinating. With Indian food, it's always about how you marinate the meat) and fresh.  They feature lots of other dishes on the menu and although they're pretty good as well, my mind and tastebuds always flock back to Roma's trusted combo."}
{"text":"Good food + Inexpensive  Located in a quiet plaza by the corner of McNIcoll and Middlefield, I stumbled upon this restaurant three years ago. I wasn't sure if I was following the right choice when I walked in, but frequent visits to this mom&pop's place says it all. Dine-in area looks simple and little bit aged. Buffets are the cheapest for the quality of food ~8-10$ depending on lunch or dinner. with 8-15+ items.  Now I am hungry and gotta go get my lunch from there"}
{"text":"The young fella with turban gave me a puzzled look thinking I went into the wrong place when I stepped inside Manpasand.   I was drawn in when I saw the signs on the windows saying Espresso Indian style and Marsala Tea. I am not BRAVE enough to try their Indian version Espresso but Marsala tea ($1.50) does sounded good!   Manpasand is a takeout, dine in and buffet restaurant. The smell here is so rich with spice and meat.... staying here a couple of minute waiting for my drink made me smell like Indian food! :)   My chai was prepared freshly to order... sweet, milky, rich and with a hint of cardamom and cinnamon.   There are also tons of Indian sweets displaying in the glass cabinets...it was not easy to resist them while I waiting for my tea to be ready!   BTW, no sighting of Roma either!"}
