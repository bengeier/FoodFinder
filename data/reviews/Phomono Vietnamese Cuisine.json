{"text":"Delicious and the service was great!  Highly recommend the beef noodle bowl!  The prices are fair and the portions are very big.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice and clean. Service is not that bad.  The food is good. Portions are not bad but it was a lot bigger when they first opened."}
{"text":"Pho broth and meat portions are usually a make or break for me - they get a 4.5/5 in this department. The service was a little slow given that they weren't too busy but the manager was very friendly and stepped in to deliver our orders. They seem to get quite a bit of takeout. Will be going back or ordering delivery"}
{"text":"this place is MEH... there's a weird smell at the doorway... food portioning is ok... they put this sauce on the protein like they are trying to mask something... the spring roll is good... service in this location don't exist though."}
{"text":"Had a Vietnamese craving while shopping in Ajax and a friend suggested Pho Mono.  I frequent the east end Pho establishments such as Pho 88, Pho Dau Bo and have always been a fan.

The restaurant is very clean and bright with modern decor touches.  Service is quite good.  Ordering via Ipad is always a plus.

I had ordered Rare beef pho, spring rolls (meat) and the fried tofu.

The pho itself was great.  Good size serving (small), meat was in large pieces, broth was flavorful.  I expected the spring rolls to have that great YELLOW colour that I'm use to and was surprised that when they came out, it wasn't but excited to try.  I feel they were quite a disappointment.  The fried tofu was dry and served with no dipping sauce.

I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Clean and modern atmosphere. We had the rare beef pho, shrimp fresh rolls and pad Thai. It all tasted great. You place your order using tablets, which I find convenient. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here during the evening on Boxing Day with my boyfriend's family to celebrate his aunt's birthday. Our reservation was for 6pm and on our arrival, it was not busy at all. I think we were the only ones there until a couple arrived sometime after. The decor was nice and the waitresses were nice and helpful as well.

I ordered the vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork, my boyfriend got the same with chicken, his cousin also got the same with beef, 2 other cousins tried the pho (it wasn't the special and I'm not too sure which specific pho they chose), one ordered some sort of chicken platter (that did not come with rice), and the last cousin ordered some platter that came with rice, soup, I think either bbq pork or beef? and some veggies on the side. We also had an order of fried rice at our table. As for the adults/aunts/uncles, I'm not too sure what they ordered...lol

Our vermicelli dishes were okay. I enjoyed the grilled pork, but the vermicelli and spring roll wasn't anything special. The vermicelli was a little too hard for our liking, that the cousin that ordered with beef didn't end up finishing his dish. Also, the cousin who ordered the platter that came with rice complained that her meat had too much bone and fat, and not enough of the actual meat. 

We were excited for the desert since they had mochi ice cream. I enjoyed my choice of mango and green tea, but oddly enough my boyfriend ordered the same but his \"mango\" looked like a light green colour and the flavour turned out to be a lime flavour, not mango.

Overall, my boyfriend and I kept on comparing this place to another place we usually go to, but since his uncle made reservations at this place, we couldn't really argue to go elsewhere. This place is decent, but has some areas of improvement."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pho place!  
I had the rare beef pho and a Vietnamese spring roll.   The broth was very flavorful and I got a lot of beef!   Normally pho places don't give you a lot. I really like the Decor of this place and I enjoyed eating here.  I would go here again and again on this cold winter days!"}
{"text":"My parents recommended this pho place to me. They told me that the soup is even better than the regular one that we always went to since my high school days. So I was eager to give it a try!

I've ordered the rare beef pho. The soup was very flavourful and I did enjoy the rice noodle, it has a good texture and tasted fresh. The beef was soft and nice. 

I've ordered both the shrimp rice roll and the spring roll. I like the fried one, it has some taro in it and some peppery taste. It was very tasty. The rice paper shrimp roll was nothing.

Give this a try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon, atmosphere was really nice and clean however the service can be really slow. Pho was ok but the vempura tofu is a must try!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Pho place considering its in Ajax. Not a lot of competition in the area so they can afford to have higher priced menu items, although their serving size and the amount of meat in the beef Pho is plentiful. Broth is also pretty good but salty. Became even more obvious that there's MSG an hour after the meal because I was extremely thirsty! But definitely don't get the vermicelli dishes, they are NOT worth it. Small servings for a puny serving of noodles, veggies, a spring roll and some grilled meat. Plus, the nuoc mum is just fish sauce and not enough vinegar. I will continue my mission to find the best Pho in Durham."}
{"text":"These guys just opened so I decided to give it a try.
We had 2 phos, rolls, Mango salad and some shrimp skewers.
The mango salad was great and so we're the rolls and the shrimp skewers.
The pho was ok too but not great. I've had many phos before and the broth is really what makes it great, I don't know what was the issue with this pho but the broth didn't have the depth and complexity that I've had before. It wasn't bad at all yet not the best I've had.
All in all I think the place have a good potential and hopefully get better when they get more experience."}
{"text":"Beef vermicelli bowl and rice rolls were pretty good. Nothing overly spectacular about them but they were delicious. 

Service could have been more attentive considering how there were only a few other customers when I was there. I was not given tea until I requested for it (it is customary for restaurants to at least ask you if you would like a beverage upon sitting down). I suggest that service should focus more on customers, especially when there weren't that many customers in the restaurant (and they were all finishing up as well)."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on 20 January 2018 at around 1:30 p.m.  The place was quite clean and the owner brought over the menu to us that was on a tablet.   We scrolled through the menu and then clicked the box to the meals we desired.   I had the House Special PHO and my husband had the Rare Beef, Beef Ball PHO.  Both were the small sized bowl, (which for us is plenty) and both were $7.95.   The food was very tasty, quick service and friendly staff.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the grilled beef steamed rice all the time when I order take out :) I just wish the delivery fee was more affordable they force you to spend $25 for free delivery they should at least have a minimum order of like $15 at least not everyone is ordering for a party or a family but never the last I'll still come back here but for takeout or dining in :)"}
{"text":"Taste was not authentic; the soup base was really off.  Worst bun bo hue I've ever had. Noodles were very soft; overcooked. Def will not be back."}
{"text":"Working in the desolate Concord area, I thought Pho Mono would be a decent lunch option in an area deprived of worthwhile places for food. (East Side Mario's? No thanks!)

Why does it take 20 bloody minutes to present to me a bowl of pho? It was not busy at all when me and a friend stopped by for lunch. Even an okay Viet place on a lull period can whip up a decent meal in 5-10 minutes.

And when my order did finally arrive, I found the broth lacking in taste, like it was watered down. The noodles were tightly clumped together. Even the sriracha on our table was watered down for some strange reason. It just was not a good first impression.

The folks staffing the joint were absolutely friendly, for some positive score, even if service is about as slow as the food. There is also the novelty of the iPad menu scheme they use. If i suppose some co-workers want to go here to escape the office together, sure I might come back and hope to be surprised. Overall I felt like the time spent didn't match up with the quality of their product."}
{"text":"This restaurant is connect with the neighboring Maki-mono.   hence the name  Pho-Mono. We've been waiting for more Vietnamese restaurants to open in Ajax, so we came here with excitement.  The place is clean, and has good decor.  The staff is friendly and they are fast here.  We had the Pho and a vermicelli dish and the satay appetizer.  The Pho was large and decent, and large with A LOT of meat.  The broth was not the best I've had but good enough for me to come back.  XL is $9.50.   Probably the most meat a Pho place has ever given me.  The vermicelli was just as pricey but skimpy.  I would not recommend it to people.   The satay is something you should pass on.  I think they might share a kitchen or part of a kitchen with the makimono AYCE restaurant and I am thinking they might just share menu items with them.  Pho-mono has a large menu with a lot of different Asian dishes like Thai and Chinese but stick with the Pho.  If a restaurant has a dish in the name of the restaurant, then that is usually is their specialty."}
{"text":"Pho Mono is a spacious, clean restaurant that's located conveniently in a long stretch of Ajax outlet stores.  Since it would be a shorter drive than to Pho Metro, we decided to give it a try, hoping that it would be good enough to be our go to Pho spot in Durham region.  

We each ordered an extra large house special Pho and a large satay beef Pho only because they don't offer a medium size.  We had a good chuckle thinking about why a restaurant would have a small, large and an extra large sizes instead of just simply having a small, medium and large.  Doesn't seem to make much sense to skip a medium and call it a large and their large, an extra large.  Anyways, I digress.

The noodles arrived fairly quickly and they were the broader and less chewy variety that I don't particularly enjoy.  My husbands extra large house special pho had some meatballs (upon partaking later, they were overcooked and chewy) and some cooked rare beef (which were also pretty tough).  Not the best cuts of meat were used and the meat portion was on a small side.  The broth was the standard out of package msg stuff that tasted like most pho broth.

My satay beef pho was the strangest version of the dish I had ever encountered at a pho restaurant.  The soup was thick and gooey from the large chunks of beef that had been coated in corn starch before being wok fried and added to the soup.  There was not enough satay sauce to really taste the satay but the gooey and goopy consistency of the broth was the most off putting thing about the noodle soup.  Overall, the noodle soup didn't taste bad, just poorly executed.  

I'm not sure if we would go back to pho mono or just choose to do the extra 10 min drive up to Pho Metro.  The jury is still out."}
{"text":"Pho was \"okay\" but the coffee really killed my experience. Yes, to MSG burn after eating noodles.

Crappy Vietnamese coffee. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"In the neighborhood and too tired to cook, I decided to get takeout from this newer Vietnamese place.

I'm fairly predictable with vermicelli, spring roll and either grilled pork or chicken. Tonight I went with pork and I am really in the fence with eating this place. 
Grilled pork was juicy and hands down the best I have ever had in a pho place.
The spring roll was okay, pepper was the lingering flavour
The vermicelli was not properly cooked as in it was hard. The sugar syrup could not save it. I didn't finish it.

I appreciate the 10% cash discount for takeout, but still I paid $10 and did not eat half of this. Time will tell if I try again on another night."}
{"text":"amazing food here.. we have never been disappointed... the prices are right and overall a great experience they don't take debit wich  is annoying but overall it's great"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. 
Clean dining room, nice food & service."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in Ajax for pho or tom yum soup. Menu is very good and friendly servers too ! Prices are good and ordering from the iPad is great. Wonton soup really good and huge sizes avail. Great spot to get your pho on."}
{"text":"True review by a Vietnamese person: this is our first time eating at pho mono. we were kind of sceptical coming to a Vietnamese restaurant that is a sister company to a Japanese sushi restaurant owned by Chinese people. but too my surprise the pho is very decent and flavourful. comparing the two pho restaurants in ajax, pho mono to pho metro I would give the upper hand to pho mono. The atmosphere and the food is much more fresher. The plate of bean spout they provide seems alot more fuller with more basil and lemon. They have fresh chilli unlike pho metro that only gives you frozen chilli only if you ask for it. As for price, they are practically the same price with the price of the XL special pho bowl being $9.00 (and change). As for service.. it a pho restaurant.. it's just a bowl of noodles with soup, that is all there is and it comes out fast! in my opinion, I have decided today to switch my pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally! A good pho place that I like! 

Place is pretty small, I think it could seat up to 40 people. You order via tablet (which is a first, never went to a pho place that let you order by tablet).

As usual, I got the house special pho (Pho Dac Biet) and it was pretty good, clear broth, very flavorful. There was a good amount of beef, tripe and beef balls in the soup. 

In comparison to all the other pho places I've tried (other than Pho Dau Bo franchises) this one is one of the best - for now haha. 

Will definitely come back for my pho fix in the future."}
{"text":"I don't know what is up with the spread of restaurants that claim to be vietnamese cuisine but also do chinese cuisine on the menu. :T The banner actually says \"vietnamese cuisine\" but when you take a closer look at their menu, they don't use any vietnamese words, and they do a whole bunch of diff stuff not common on a vietnamese cuisine menu. Again, probably targeted to a different demographic... And I could totally see based on what people came in for a sit down meal. But this is definitely not a place I can have dinner with my family who  expect authentic experience.

I got the house special pho in small size. I will say that the pho taste was alright, albeit on the lighter side. What stood out was that my pho had quite a lot of meat toppings. A plus for me. Noodles were done well, just right. 

My parents did not like the nuoc mam with their rice plate, and said it was too sour, not enough fish sauce. That in itself ruined their meal unfortunately. Well also the fact that they realized this place wasn't authentic based on the fact that the staff do not speak vietnamese and the menu itself entirely catered to non vietnamese people.

Service was great though. We got a hot tea and a lemon water each. That's pretty special. The restaurant uses an ipad for ordering and its pretty useful to get an idea of what to order if you don't know what any thing on there is."}
{"text":"Modern space with a fancy way to order your food (using an iPad).

Unfortunately none of the dishes is that memorable. The crispy noodle dish was pretty good, but everything else is meh.

Don't recommend, sorry :("}
{"text":"Living in Durham region, the availability of Viet food is next to none so it was nice to find this place.  As everyone has said, the restaurant itself is modern and clean which is always good.  I like how they have delivery service (depending on a minimum order and distance) even though I haven't used it.  Having eaten hundreds if not thousands of bowls of Pho in my lifetime, I can say the Pho here is not too shabby.  I like their choice of flat noodles and the broth is flavourful with what you would expect from a Pho broth.  The reason I gave them a low rating is because I have ordered different noodle soup items from their menu (the Hue noodle) and a Thai beef stew and well, both of them were utter disappointments to say the least.  The problem wasn't that they were having and off day -- it's a fundamental problem.  It's their recipe.  Anyone who is Viet and has eaten a bowl of Hue noodles can attest that it is fundamentally different than Pho.  The flavours, the color of the broth, the noodles and the meats.  The bowl of Hue noodles I received was essentially Pho broth with a different type of noodle.  Not good at all. It's as if McDonalds released a new burger, charged a premium price for it and gave you a Big Mac but on a brioche bun.  Pho Mono should really not be selling this item as it is doing a MAJOR disservice to Viet cuisine by introducing people to a very FAUX bowl of noodles.  As for the Thai stew, let's just say a legit Viet restaurant wouldn't stray too far from its roots.  The funny thing is that Viet cuisine does have a stewed beef noodle item that is tomato based so I'm not sure why they needed to slap the THAI in front of it.  Again, it was essentially their house Pho broth with stewed beef.

If you're looking for Pho in Durham, this isn't a bad choice.  If you're looking for authentic Viet food, drive an extra 20 minutes and find some place in Scarborough or North York."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. 

It had been six months since I had visited Ajax. At one point, I was there at least once a month. I ended the drought last weekend. 

After spending some time at Old Navy and Best Buy, I drove over to where all the box stores are. I was hungry and noticed a new pho place. I didn't need to think twice. I parked and walked in to the restaurant for a late lunch. 

The place is clean, and the booths are comfy and modern. I got fresh shrimp rolls, and a large rare beef and beef brisket pho. I also got a coconut, non-diary bubble tea with tapioca.

The shrimp rolls were yummy. The dipping sauce had peanuts, so I was in heaven. Everything was fresh and tasty. 

I normally don't do a large pho. I'mbglad that I did. I was hungry. The pho was good. You get a lot of meat! Normally, I don't get the brisket, because it's hit or miss. This one was decent. Not a ton of fat that makes me gag, but enough to keep the pho flavourful. 

The coconut bubble tea was yummy. I got it without dairy. I was a happy camper, except when I sucked down a tapioca ball too fast. It made me cough, but it wasn't serious. 

I'm glad that Ajax had a pho place. Staff are friendly, and speak both Vietnamese and Cantonese. I'd come back to try my usual -- rare beef and beef ball pho.

{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon with a friend because we were both craving pho. This pho place recently opened up near my area not too long ago. 
It wasn't that busy and we got seated right away.
They have an iPad menu which was convenient.
The place itself was quite nice and the decor was subtle, nothing too over the top.

The foods seems to be a fusion of Asian styles with a nice selection of items. My friend and I both got the rare beef pho and spring rolls, our usual and the broth was great. The broth taste was clear with not a lot of MSG like other places, so that was a plus. The portion for a small size pho was also great, lots of noodles. 

The waiter that seated us and took our orders was nice and friendly. He was attentive and I asked about the free dessert for yelp and he gave it to me after our meal. 

I would definitely come back again when I'm craving pho, it was priced fairly and very close by."}
{"text":"The beef broth for the pho is nice. Not spectacular or the best pho I've had but it is one of the better pho places in the durham region."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it's cool that you use an iPad for dinner.  Their is pretty good especially on a cold winter night in Canada.  

Great selection and staff is nice.  Place is clean too.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Ajax! Came here for dinner with my wife. She wanted soup on this cold spring day. Ordered the rare beef Pho (small), was enough for two people!  Their mango salad was very good as well.  Service was fast and very friendly!"}
