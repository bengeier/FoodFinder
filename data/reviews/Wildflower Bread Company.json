{"text":"Mmmmm.......bread......

Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to be writing a review. Wildflower is easily our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast too. This place is always clean, always busy, and ordering is always easy. 

We usually get the same thing every visit, since it is so tasty. We both get the potato cream cheese soup, no matter what time of year (yes, it is that good!), I get the chicken and feta, and hubby gets the BLT. Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.

Now breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious. 

So, we love supporting this place, and think it kicks Paradise's butt. We are wishing and praying that they would bring one to Surprise, although that might not be good for my waistline...."}
{"text":"I arrived at Phoenix Sky Harbor looking for a good cup of coffee and discovered Miss Jessica knew how to create a signature drink with half the sugar.  She was pleasant and fun to talk to.   Knowledgeable employees are always a credit to your business. I will make sure to revisit this location again.  I recommend your shop when traveling to, from, or through Phoenix.

Thank you and know you have a good employee in Miss Jessica.

{"text":"Wildflower Bread Co. is one of my favorite places to eat. The food, service and environment is always excellent."}
{"text":"This is a chain, but not all chains have to be bad news. They're Arizona-based, so if you live here, why not patronize their business? The money is still staying in your state. Most chains are bad news and grace the armpits of major cities like rampant pubic lice (also known as \"strip mall Hells\"), but these guys might restore your faith in that all-too-often abused model, a little.

Somehow, though, they still reminded me a bit of a tiny Souplantation where the food is brought to you and the menu is innovative. It's probably just the pale wood interior and glass sneeze guards. But these people are reviving the ancient art of breadmaking and turning it into something trendy and accessible to people who don't eat at anything but chains. ( I saw a picture of someone making bread in a book in an antique shop once.) They need at least some kudos for this. 

On to my meal: the Caribbean Jerk chicken salad is pretty darned good. I didn't find it spicy enough, and I would have put fresh thyme, some shallots, scotch bonnet peppers, and the tiniest breath of allspice in it, but I did field research in the Caribbean and know how that stuff is supposed to taste. This was the first Caribbean jerk anything that I've ordered on any menu and didn't find deeply disappointing. The size of the salad was perfect--not too big (salads don't keep well as leftovers), and not too small (it was sufficiently filling and I'm 6'3\"). The pieces of nondescript bread on the side were homemade, so how could I complain?

My wife's roast beef with gorgonzola cheese was gone before I could demand my own bite. Her little sister's roasted sweet potato sandwich (carb-on-carb seemed redundant, but what else can vegetarians really eat?) was also much appreciated by the little sis, and was gone before I could bully the slightest smidgen out of her. There wasn't much service, but it was fast; the atmosphere was industrial, but I saw a lot of cool combinations of ingredients. 

I would have liked to have seen less of a \"we're trying to make mega bank and stick only to things we know we do well\" atmosphere, but a chain is a chain to some degree. There are also very few items for people with gluten allergies or who can't eat bread. But for lunch on a Sunday afternoon in strip mall Hell, this place was more than adequate, earning it an \"A-OK\" rating of three stars. Most chains have a repulsive formula, but this chain's formula is far less odious than most."}
{"text":"I come to Arizona a few times a year and within each visit we need to come to Wildflower Bread Company. I am always pleased with the customer service, during my last visit I met Edwina. She recommended breakfast items and kept pleasant conversation going.  I didn't feel rushed especially at 7 in the morning, she was very upbeat and knowledgeable on the menu offerings. My wife and I were very pleased with the Bacon and Egg Sandwich and the Banana Walnut Pancakes, we will return. Great job on staffing Wildflower!"}
{"text":"Great customer service even at 4 in the morning! I had the ultimate bacon and egg sandwich and it was very good. The pesto, arugula, and slow-cooked tomatoes gave the sandwich that extra dimension that makes it different from any other ordinary egg sandwich. If you're not into that stuff though I noticed that the wildflower egg sandwich is pretty much the same just without that stuff. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great customer but ten minutes for a bowl of soup
....  Other than this ....  Grade a customer service.  Atmosphere was chill and I felt very welcomed. The young lady at the register was patient"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch option with a variety of options and you don't have to deal with a waiter. My only complaint is that they periodically phase out a lot of the great lunch sandwiches, so I end up reverting back to the meatball sandwich. The most recent one they phased out was the braised beef; there was another one before that -- forgot the name."}
{"text":"I got the mixed grill sandwich which was about $8. It was really good and different. However the price for how big the sandwich is was a little too much. Paradise Bakery has a better value but it was nice to have something different."}
{"text":"I was hungry and in a rush but Jayme Smith got me my order fast and got me out in time to make my flight.   Many thanks!"}
{"text":"The staff is great, great food but my FAVORITE is the Kale 12 salad!  It is the best salad I've ever had.  I order it with the dressing on the side. Filled with delicious grilled veggies. .... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here routinely for years. You order at a counter and your food is brought to your table. The menu is really varied, the quality is excellent, the prices are reasonable for what you get, and the decor is beautiful for an (almost) fast-food, seat-yourself type of place. The staff are really friendly and service is good. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Great salads, but pricey for the setting. Desserts look amazing, but are disappointing. Pastas at dinner tend to be saturated in oil/butter, and leave lots of grease behind. For the price it's worth venturing somewhere else."}
{"text":"A mediocre meal at most. I had the apple brie frittata with not even warm potatoes and cold toast. When i returned the cold poatoes, the kitchen dumped them in their the fryolator. By the time I got them, again, my meal was over. Too many dining options close to this one makes your money better spent elsewhere.LGO is close by and they have a real manager there to make sure the plates go out hot, not tepid. Good bread here,  but the kitchen's food is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Two things before I talk about the food itself- 

1. Kudos to Sky Harbor for picking GOOD restaurants to go in the airport-- Matt's Big breakfast? Perfect. Blancos Taco? Perfect. Wildflower was another really good choice to show the travelers to our state that while we may have some of the dumbest politicians ever, we also have some of the best local fare, and not only Mexican food.

And 2. Traveling for my work, I am subjected to some of the surliest and crankiest food service workers in the airports around the country. It's like pulling teeth to get a polite smile or a \"Thank you\" from them. I get it, you are irritated for having to go through security everyday. Get over it or get another job. That same attitude is NOT here at this Wildflower- I don't know who does the hiring, but it must be a prerequisite to have a super positive attitude. While I was waiting for my food, I watched several interactions between the employees-It seemed like they not only liked each other, they also were glad when a customer came to order from them, unlike a majority of airport restaurants where you can feel the irritation because you interrupted Angry Birds level 32, or whatever. If this is a Jesus club like Chik-Fil-A or Culvers, they hide the crazy and just show the love, like a good cult is supposed to.

Now for the food. I would love to say I ate a ton, because I really just went for a coffee, but the lady behind the counter actually told me about a salad and changed my order from a latte, to a lunch and latte. I got the quinoa salad with lime vinaigrette and vegetables, and I was so happy that whoever prepared it knew to keep them crisp and cold, and not drown the whole bowl in vinaigrette. Also, I feel like I finally understand kale, it was added in just the right amount and didn't taste like something you pull up by the root from between the sidewalk cracks. (And the latte was better than my normal Starbucks.. I really didn't expect that!)
.
I don't write a lot of reviews, (but I read a ton of them) but I was so impressed by this location, especially considering it was at an airport, I had to comment on this one- Definitely worth your time if you are traveling to (or from?) Sky Harbor- (And thanks for the salad suggestion, Selene!)"}
{"text":"I have been here a million times over the years and have not met one person who doesn't love Wildflower. That includes my grandma who is a rather picky woman. Their service is great. The food is wonderful. And it connected to Changing Hands Book Store which is a fun little shop even if you're not looking for a book. 

As for food, I recommend potato cream cheese soup bread bowl. It sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing. For salad, I'm hooked on their Thai chicken salad. I really like their iced tea too. 

Wildflower is the kind of place you can just get a quick lunch or spend the afternoon reading, doing homework or chatting it up with friends."}
{"text":"This is my most fav location of this chain.  So friendly.  Service is always fast, professional and with a smile.  These people really make you feel like part of the family.  Love the lattes and sourdough bread.  For breakfast the Ham & Brie Frittata can't be beat."}
{"text":"We just came in from a red-eye flight from Hawaii. We were exhausted, hungry and looking for no hassle breakfast. .. we found it. Staff was excellent, the service was fast and personal. They made an effort to move everyone through the lines quickly, and personally handed you your food to make sure everything was okay. Whoever the manager is of this take-out gets 5 gold stars from me!! Wonderful morale with the staff too. Good job."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower! Perfect place for a lunch date with a friend! Often times I pick up Wildflower bread, salad, or soup and supplement them into my dinner plans at home. I particularly love the service at this location. They are always fast and super friendly! I've had little \"enjoy\" letters in my to-go bag and once forgot a muffin at the register and the cashier ran out to my car. I appreciate all their service with a smile"}
{"text":"This really is one of the few good breakfast/brunch places I know of on the west side. The food is always good and I have always had great service here."}
{"text":"We've been to this location multiple times and always leave satisfied. Management there is always great as are all the employees. Super friendly, helpful and patient! The food is also always good. Actually, everything I've had here leaves me satisfied. This is definitely one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Since my bad experience last June Wildflower went out of their way to earn my business back. Ownership reached out to me and apologized for my bad experience. Refunded my meal and invited me to provide more feedback regarding their Arcadia location. I am pleased to say Wildflower in Arcadia has fixed their staffing issues. Their customer service is very good and their food comes out fast and fresh. Once again I am a regular at the Arcadia location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go with my mom and sisters. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything on their menu is fresh and amazing. However, their potato cream cheese soup is my absolute favorite. That with one of their sourdough rolls  or any of their fresh baked bread because it's all so delicious.  
The service is always very warm and genuine. Anthony and Lina both do a wonderful job making sure all customers are happy with their experience, all while never losing a smile on their faces. 11/10 I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I went in on Saturday June 17 at the Goodyear location for dinner and ordered a pasta, I have to say that was one of the best pastas I've ever had there!!! Everything about the pasta was fantastic the amount of sauce, chicken and veggies usually when I go there it's not enough ingredients I asked a person walking around who made the pasta they went to go find out so next time I go in I'll be sure to ask for Jasmine"}
{"text":"I got a taste of the braised beef sandwich at Yelp in Bloom and today was my first chance to try it in its full glory.  There was no way I should've finished the whole thing. But I did, and true to the sample from Yelp in Bloom, it was delicious! Beef and mashed potatoes in a sandwich served with au jus and horseradish on the side. The sandwich also comes with regular and sweet potato chips. I also enjoyed the blackberry orange lemonade. The place was quite busy due to the book signing by Chelsea Handler going on next door at Changing Hands, but the workers hustled and the place remained clean and pleasant. Super friendly service adds to the appeal of this location."}
{"text":"Go for breakfast or dinner (after 3). Lunches are lacking. I ordered their Chopped Salad (which is a knockoff of the Stetson salad from Cowboy Chiao). I've had it before and it was pretty good. This time, they served it without 2 main ingredients which is pretty apparent if you're familiar with the Stetson's signature \"rows\" of ingredients. I pointed it out and they said those ingredients were out and offered me a cookie to compensate. If you know the salad is incomplete don't let customers pay $7.99 for it with the hopes they won't notice or be too shy to speak up. With so many great options in the Scottsdale Airpark area, I doubt I'll ever be back. Sad

Oh, by the way, Cowboy Chiao is located on Stetson Drive in Old Town Scottsdale. The Stetson salad is only $10.99 and they actually take pride in it. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Great local chain of restaurants!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon to do some work. They have free WiFi by the way with plugs at each of the booths.

Wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the Turkey Waldorf full salad. It was completely delicious and very filling. It had turkey, apples, grapes, carrots, onions, pecans, and cranberries. Also came with a balsamic vinaigrette. They were a little too generous with the vinaigrette so I will probably ask it on the side next time. Also came with two freshly baked pieces of bread that were very soft and warm and delicious with some butter. 

Once you order at the register, you just sit down and someone will bring the food to you. Also, once you're done, someone will come and take your plates away. 

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was bright and clean. I will wait to give it 5 stars until I try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I was hosting a meeting in the Phoenix area and had booked another catering company. After a huge storm there were areas with no power and the catering company I booked were without power. With just a few hours notice wildflower catering showed up with an amazing spread of sandwiches, salad, chips and baked goods. The food was absolutely delicious. It was so good that I changed my catering for the next day to have the exact same lunch. The 25 attendees of my meeting were very impressed with the food! I would definitely recommend them for any catering needs!"}
{"text":"Eaten here many times, just figured I should write a review after eating at another bakery that claims to be \"Paradise\" that shall not be named.  Wink Wink.  They have this crazy concept of ordering your food at a register, paying the cashier, then waiting for your food to be prepared.  Mind Blown!  The only thing that bums me out is that sometimes they have the Cuban sandwich and other times they don't.  If it's on the menu it's the only thing I will order, if it's not it isn't the end of the world.  They have a wide variety of interesting sandwiches and standard soups that are done very well.  Plus they always have The Arizona Republic available to read!"}
{"text":"Gustavo - excellent salad! Chicken pistachio pomegranate with arugula. Super fresh ingredients. Thinly sliced chicken.  Dressing on the side was a perfect touch.  Always enjoy dinner at Wildflower - healthy choice for a midweek work night."}
{"text":"Fabulous for dinner when you want a great sandwich or more. Loved the sweet potato sandwich with fig confit on marble rye (ask for that choice of bread if they have it). Frank at the Seville location is the manager and his attention to his customers as well as the attention from the staff makes you feel right at home. Hidden dinner gem."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant  ! Especially this location..Always a line up but it moves quickly. Actually I appreciated being in line so I had a few moments to make up my mind about what to order...Everything sounds so exciting, such a creative menu & all made from scratch. i ordered the Oriental chicken salad with almond & sesame seeds and thai peanut dressing. It was great & he portion was huge..I couldn't even finish it.
My husband had a turkey breast & brie sandwich with roasted red peppers on herb bread, which was also delicious.
We would highly recommend this restaurant as a nutritious & great dining experience 1"}
{"text":"THE BEST PANCAKES IN THE VALLEY! Service is much better than it used to be. I think they finally got a good manager on board. When it is real busy on the weekends it seems a little hectic, but I have never had a wrong order. Nice clean place, nice bathrooms, free WiFi and decent parking. Breakfast is solid every time. I have had dinner so much I can't go back, but it is good. Probably been there at least 100 times now for breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday sept 29. I didn't realize it was a deli. I like to be served when I go out and I would have left to go elsewhere but I was hungry and getting cranky. I didn't like the noise level and the way the restaurant was set up. Lots of tables all crammed together. But then what do I expect from a cafeteria? However, the breakfast sandwich I had was quite good. The bread was fresh and soft with a nice outer crust that wasn't too crispy. The egg filling was cooked perfect, not to dry or soggy. I won't go back because of the serve yourself deli, but I did enjoy my sandwich, but then I was very hungry."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Had the BLT and the cheese was weird and warm. Had a weird little side of potato salad that was nothing special."}
{"text":"Love the bread!!! Healthy salad options, bakery goods are delicious too! Breakfast here is always delicious as well.  Good customer service, consistent food quality and overall yumminess!"}
{"text":"My family has always enjoyed the food here, but I wanted to pass along a great customer service experience we had at the Scottsdale Hayden location.

My husband and I  recently took our college age daughter out for dinner there. She had just had her tonsils out and was looking forward to the chicken soup. Unfortunately, that was not on the menu. When we mentioned the situation to the cashier, she went back to the kitchen and let them know. Almost immediately, a member of the staff came out and put the chicken soup back on the menu!

That small gesture really made our night."}
{"text":"Yelp cuts off my full review, so feel free to visit my blog for the full review, as I have condensed this one to mention just the food:

http://bit.ly/bu8taT

[Begin excerpt]
The Food:
This is what the review is all about, and this is where WBC really shines.  For the remainder of any additional WBC reviews I do, I can skip all of the introductory information and link back to it, because the food is the only thing we mix up.

WBC uses very fresh ingredients.  Obviously any dishes that have a bread component to them is baked fresh in their bakery daily.  Sandwiches come with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, delightful cheeses, etc.  It seems like when the owner or head chef of the WBC was creating the menu they really believed in the old creed that \"Fresh ingredients make a fresh taste.\" 

In the most recent visit, I ordered the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich with the mixed chips and honey mustard on the side.

This particular sandwich is a \"hot sandwich\" the thick layer of Swiss cheese comes melted and layered between succulent pieces of 99% fat-free turkey pastrami.  Served on a piece of caraway rye bread, I found this sandwich to be one of my favorites.  I order the honey mustard on the side, but I feel the need to explain that I do this because I love it so much. 

The WBC honey mustard can only be described as the thickest and tastiest combination of flavors you will ever try.  They make real honey mustard (none of this high fructose corn syrup stuff), where you can see the honey in the honey mustard.  I usually get it on the side because I am a dipper (both my chips and my sandwich) and it makes each bite have a rush of flavors.

My wife ordered the Caesar salad (dressing on the side) and their famous Potato Cream Cheese soup.

The customary procedure for our meals is that I sample some of her food, and she samples some of mine.  In this particular case I have actually ordered this exact meal before, so I can describe it pretty well.  My wife usually finds this to be her favorite soup.  Served just hot enough (not scolding, and not cold) it comes with a piece of bread for dipping and usually in a cup or a bread boule.  The soup has a creamy cheese taste and each bite is overflowing with soft pieces of potato.  

The salad is crisp and delicious and is served with pieces of thinly cut fresh Parmesan cheese, which I promptly steal from my wife and eat for myself.  Muaha!
 
After our meal there is a 99% chance we've already ordered some sort of pastry to nom on, so BEHOLD:  2 Chocolate Chip Cookies.

Alright, let's just everybody relax.  These cookies are gooooooood.  Freshly baked, always soft, bitter-sweet chocolate chips.  I am strong enough to admit that I don't love these as much as Paradise Bakery cookies, but my wife does.  I think it's the semi-sweet chocolate chips they use.  But I can admit, these are damn good cookies.  Good enough that I order one with every meal (except breakfast)."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and do work if you want something a little more substantial than a coffee shop.  Can't say I'd recommend the espresso drinks but everything else is consistently good.  Spacious, free wi-fi with many electrical outlets.  Affordable, friendly staff and in a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped by for desert after dinner. We were just getting something sweet to take home. At 8 PM on a Friday, place looked closed. Dining room was dark and employee was carrying tea jugs across the dining room. Checked to see if open, so went inside. Ordered a ginger cheesecake with biscotti crust and a tart slice of lemon pie. Boyfriend enjoyed the cheesecake. I didn't enjoy the lemon pie so much. I'm sorry, but a bakery cafe should not be serving lemon pie with a soggy, half done crust. The crust should be flaky and crisp. Filling should be clear and tart. Didn't live up to my expectations. Ordered two cranberry scones for the morning. Hope they will be ok."}
{"text":"My wife and I were passing through the area looking for a bagel place, and this came up in the Yelp search. Saw that they had a sandwich with Taylor Ham, and as an East Coast transplant, that's my jam. That sandwich was excellent, and the Swiss cheese they used was really good (it would have been slightly better with a fried egg instead of scrambled, but whatever). The standout, though, was the roasted sweet potato sandwich with fig confit, fresh mozzarella, arugula, roasted fennel, and balsamic, which was at least as delicious as that description would lead you to believe."}
{"text":"Why on this, you're website , you charge me $6.99 for enough tea to make 3 GALLONS but when I go to your store you try to charge me $1.50+ per tea bag each time I refill my cup with hot water is beyond me. Panera can act like they care about people all they want, but in the end they lack morals. I understand you need to make a profit however, I know for a fact that by selling a cup of tea you make more than enough to allow the customers 3 teabags on a visit and still make a profit. . Just like the Paradise bakery across the street, the only two places I've left a yelp review, the Panera family of companies doesn't really care, they're just an over priced fast food company trying to ride the coat tails of actual companies who care about providing quality products and services.  http://www.wildflowerbread.com/flower-shop/"}
{"text":"The Chop Salad! and the fact that this place is connected to my favorite book store, make it a great stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"Only decent place close to Arrowhead mall to have a good sandwich or bowl of soup. Come early! If you try to come between noon and 130pm the line is pretty much out the door. Coffee and pastries are very good, nice selection. The kids meals provide a good variety of choices, drink and a cookie, all cost around $5."}
{"text":"Nice place, I liked the food! Their salads and soups are the best. During launch hour things can be slow...decent size meals.. I sometimes stop there in the morning for coffee and a Danish!i do recommend going there at least once if you have nt already."}
{"text":"The food is very good. However, the lunch crowd is unbearable. Many elderly people and others who order a pastry or soup and sit there for hours. There is not enough seating and they need to make a policy of asking people to leave after they finish their meals. I can't tell you how many times myself and my coworkers have left due to the fact that there is no seating. We never spend under $40. This place is loosing A LOT of Money by not getting people to move on and not sit there as rude customers when they see others need to sit down. Perhaps replacing all the booths with less comfortable seating. As a business owner it would drive me CRAZY to be loosing business due to the above situation."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the Wildflower Bread Store Sky Harbor waiting for my daughter to arrive from LA.  My chicken salad sandwich, squash soup and passion ice tea were tasty.  The service was very fast (less than 2 minutes).  Jennifer and the rest of the staff have been over-the-top gracious.  I've been sitting here over an hour now and have watched each and every staff member treat each and every guest with the utmost care -- fast turnaround, friendly, and helpful.  You have a great crew here! Kudos!"}
{"text":"My second time through here in a month headed for a red eye flight to the east coast.  Last time a Thursday night at 930pm was quiet but now it's a Friday at 930pm and the place is hopping. Very quick.  Very fresh and tasty.  Super helpful staff.  Can't say enough good things.  The colorful salads are yummy, have really healthy options, and they will switch out dressings.  Tables and counter space and phone charging ports.  Makes a 3 hour layover a comfortable tasty and productive time!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing everything was very fresh and it had a nice cozy atmosphere. They had a wonderful staff who had my order ready to go in no time at all. Definitely recommend stopping by this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good, healthy and reasonable priced. The staff here is always so very very nice. It is just a feel good place all the way around.  There is a lady that works there (wish I would have gotten her name) who just seems so motherly and caring. She was the one delivering food once the order came up. She gave the little boy next to me a cookie because he was reading a cookie monster book and he was so thrilled. Hard to find lovely people these days.  So I always find time to stop here and eat on my travels through the Phoenix airport.

The downside is that it is before you go through TSA, so give yourself plenty of time to stop here and eat.  I just LOVE their coffee but unfortunately I have to finish it before going through TSA. I hate that part."}
{"text":"I simply must thank you for the superior service I received while dining at your establishment last Friday . You staff(Asian lady) went above and beyond to make sure our experience was the best it could be. Not only we did ask to change tables twice, but we inconvenienced her by asking her to change our food. She took it all in stride and never treated our party with anything less than the utmost professionalism. It is service like this that will keep us coming back to your restaurant again and again.
She thank us for providing her an opportunity to serve. She said our ongoing commitment is to always treat you like a valued member of  the Wildflower family. Our managers are expected to do what it takes to ensure our guest leave delighted. 
Impressive!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way back to California.  Had the three cheese frittata breakfast and it was Delicious!  The home fries were perfectly baked and seasoned.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Most of the breads here are vegan but high gluten, none are gluten free though. They offer 1 soup that is vegan and a couple that are vegetarian. The veggie soup that was vegan was pretty tasty, had more flavor and depth to it than cafeteria or canned soup. They even have bread bowls here!!
The salads and veggie sandwiches are pretty good too. I like this place over similar bakery restaurants due to them having more options.
They offer breakfast in the mornings and open for lunch and dinner for their soups, sandwiches, salads and pastas (oh and desserts ). They also have fresh loaves of breads they bake that you can buy and take home."}
{"text":"I work in the mall and eat at Wildflower occasionally. I have learned to always dine-in because to-go orders take twice as long (longer if you inform the staff you are on a lunch break).

I'm not usually disappointed by the quality of the food, but this evening, both service and food were sub par. 

As soon as I stepped up to the counter the employee working the register walked away, without acknowledging me or the people forming a line behind me. When she returned, there was no mention of her absence. 

My food took longer than usual for dine-in orders, but I attributed it to the dish I ordered. I had never ordered their pasta before and I won't make the same mistake again. It's possible the speed of the order had something to do with the amount of time the garlic bread needed to be toasted to achieve that particular shade of black. It was inedible. The noodles were both overcooked and undercooked at the same time-- a real feat. The pasta itself was fairly cold.

Being raised in the restaurant business, I have thicker skin when it comes to bad service or flubbed orders, but this meal was not worth the wait nor the money."}
{"text":"Wildflower is just okay. Their breakfasts are delicious (I love their roasted veggie frittata) but when breakfast is over, so is my love for them. I personally find very few things on their menu to be exciting but I do appreciate that it is one of the few places in the valley that serves a daily rotating menu of soups, even if that menu does not always match up with what is listed online. Another major issue is their consistency, or lack thereof. Sometimes your order will be overflowing with a specific topping and other times it will be non-existent. If you do go, be sure to try their oatmeal butterscotch kiss cookie, it is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love everything about this particular location.  Food is always right on target.  Atmosphere is relaxing and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location pretty regularly since they opened it. What's not to like about Wildflower? The bread is terrific, I'm especially a fan of the $2 Dough to Go baguettes that blow doors off of anything from the other local bakeries. 

While the bread itself is great, my passion is the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. The first time I ordered this sandwich, I almost sent it back not realizing it had the \"Wildflower Coleslaw,\" which just looked too busy for my palate. However, it turns out to be the secret ingredient, with its white raisins, cabbage, and jicama providing a sweet and crunchy texture to the perfectly seasoned turkey pastrami. 

My favorite part of dining at Wildflower? It's a local company. Yes, it's all sexy and looks corporate like a Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery, but it's an AZ company that contributes to the community. It's nice to know that if I get a gross sammi I can march up to Scottsdale and throw it at the CEO's head."}
{"text":"My staple here-

Chicken Continental, 
Ciabatta bread (loveeee), honey mustard, tomatoes, lettuce, broiled chicken! (I wish the chicken was actually grilled)
The bread and the pungent mustard are my absolute favorite items here, and their fresh OJ is pretty good for a morning snack. I try to get some extra honey mustard so I can spice up my veggie wraps

I really havent had a bad sandwich here, the bread is pretty solid, the flavors are on- nothing extraordinarily new age or innovative, but its standard, delicious, reliable."}
{"text":"Took my dughter here for some chicken noodle soup. I tried the Autumn Pumpkin and it was delicious.  She had the Turkey with Wild Rice. Both soups came with large chunks of bread. I also got her one of the bottled apple juices, and she didn't like it but I thought it was good because it actually tasted like an apple. Definetly coming back here for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Have come here few days ago. They have breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, and yummy drinks here. This place is a bit expensive but airport food is always insanely expensive so I guess it's to be expected. Highly recommend this place for u guys !!!"}
{"text":"I give up.  Customers for many years, my husband and I have had it. Long slow lines every time of day.  While waiting, you can see the burnout on the faces of the cooks.  Have to check take out every time for mistakes.  The food is always great.  Still miss the lasagne.   The hassle is just not worth it any longer.  Further the place just doesn't get cleaned up.  Waiting in the take out chair for lunch, mid week.  The mess just under the front counter was sumac turning.  How long had it been collecting?  Have found a clean, roomy locations  with a great patio elsewhere and now meet friends there.  There are so many clean delicious choices at Ray and 101 this pace is moot."}
{"text":"I've been here about 10 times and the food always satisfies. I personally enjoy their egg sandwiches (their Spicy Chipotle egg sandwich was awesome) and I usually pick up a baked good for dessert (raspberry croissant). Sometimes seating can be hard to find weekend mornings though. They also have a little sidewalk patio for those who prefer the outdoors."}
{"text":"Service was fast, and the food was really good! Brooklyn was extremely helpful in helping me find something that fit my dietary needs. The place was a little crowded, but then again it is an airport. I'll definitely visit here again!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and found tat this Wild Flower was down the street. I found that the service was quick and done right. The food came out in about 6 min. The soup bread bowl was great gotta love that potato cream cheese soup. And the sandwich didn't fall apart. I will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Couldn't have picked a better place to go eat! Staff is amazing friendly and very welcoming an employee really standed out Britney Reid recommended great plates to my fiancé & I. She helps us decide on a meal and really enjoyed it great fresh tasting food very clean environment. KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK BRITNEY REID!!! We were exhausted from our flight and you sure made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Love this place, it has the best potato cheese soup ever. And Erin that works the register was so sweet, she made sure I got the last bread bowl. The chocolate croissants are wicked good,"}
{"text":"If you want to spend time on the internet and have a nice meal this is a great place for it.  Some things on the menu are better than others, but the ambiance is nice and the wifi works well."}
{"text":"I agree with those stating Wildflower is great! Also, I LOVE the Cuban Sandwich and would like to beg them to keep it on menu at all times!! Also, their mustard cannot be beat!  Love Breadheads!  BUT BRING THE CUBAN BACK!!  Love You!"}

{"text":"my sister and a few friends went for a morning road bike ride to this place. 
the food was great and light but yet filling. i didn't feel like i ate a pan of grease after eating here. it was a good quality, healthy breakfast. 

the customer service was great!! they were really friendly and helpful with what we needed. 

i will definitely come back to this place and enjoy myself a honey cured-ham with apple and brie cheese breakfast. YUMMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Real good food a little pricey but breakfasts are great. Pancakes are very good. Their breads are like homemade."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was greeted by a clearly irritated employee. Note my sarcasm. The person behind the counter didn't even say hi or even try to muster up a smirk. Nothing. Ignored it since I'm used to this type of service in today's industry. Most places just hire teenagers that are only required to pay their insurance and have no idea what actual responsibility is. Food was good and came it in a timely manner so I can't complain about that. Went to use the bathroom after I ate and became highly concerned due to its lack of cleanliness. The bathroom was disgusting and there was no soap in there. I hope the employees have their own bathroom because they should be washing their hands before going back to work and that's hard to do with no soap. This is my second time visiting Wildflower, the first time being at the Chandler mall location. I think it's safe to say I'll never go back to the Tempe location again."}
{"text":"Family friendly and we love the soups and salads.  Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!!  We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious.  Sunday brunch is great too.  We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum.  Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick.  We'be been going for years and will continue to go.  Oh, did I mention the free WiFi?  Great for some business lunches."}
{"text":"My wife and I first visited this place about three weeks ago. We knew nothing about this place and wanted to try something different as far as dining out. When we walked in we were greeted by a young lady named Allison . We told Allison that we had never been to Wildflower and asked if she could help us out. Allison took the time to explain thoroughly and in great detail about Wildflower. She helped us greatly in figuring out what we wanted to order. She answered all our questions and was very patient with us. While we were eating Allison took the time to check on us and make sure everything was fine. My wife and I were very impressed with her customer service! Well on this visit everything was perfect and the food was amazing. We ordered from the breakfast menu. 
Since our first visit we have been back 4 times and have been waited on by Allison 3 times. The soup in a bread bowl is incredible! It is our favorite now.  All the employees seem really nice here but there is that extra hospitality you receive from Allison. She definitely knows the meaning of customer service and how to treat guest. Allison is very passionate about her job and you see that she really cares. We are regular customers now and every visit we hope Allison is working. It is tough enough to find excellent customer service now a days. Nothing against the other employees but we have been treated with the highest respect and the upmost customer service from Allison that we will not go to anybody else when visiting this establishment. She is definitely an asset to this company and you need multiples of her on how to be proud of where you work, a pleasant disposition and the value of quality in customer care. I myself have been in customer service for thirty years and know what it means to take care of the customer. I could go on and on about how Allison displays five star customer service but you need to experience it for yourself. Allison thank you for making our visits so special and enjoyable. Allison Hardy you are the best and you deliver the best in customer service.
Kudos to you."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sitting in the airport and just grabbed a pretzel and some iced tea....perfect."}
{"text":"We tried their sandwiches and soups, and they were very yummy. The interior is delightful and bright. 

Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, a bit overpriced...
I walked in for the first time and had no clue where to begin.  It was not even 11am so only three other customers were in the place.  No employee gave me a greeting or directed me where to go. The line is a bit confusing."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower. My daughter and I have gone here once a week for the last 2 months and we've never been disappointed. Breakfast was awesome. Best french toast and pancakes ever. But even better than our food was our service. Sarah was too sweet and kind and helpful to go unnoticed. She deserves some recognition!  2 THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"I Love Wildflower! I eat here a few times a week. I have never had bad service or an issue with my food. Michelle is defiantly my favorite employee there. Very personable, quick and knowledgeable. I always order out just because the parking lot is always so busy. No complaint though. Just means they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"I know it sounds strange to say this at a place where you go to a counter and order, but service here is very hit and miss.  On several occasions I have waited patiently in line to have my order taken only to have the one person working the counter take a call for an order and let me stand there.  On other occasions when there have been more people they scatter to answer phones, move to the bakery counter or leave the front all together for whatever reason.  It has been bad enough that I have left and gone to subway 2 doors down instead.

The sad thing is the food is good for this type of bakery/restaurant but the service particularly at lunch makes me want to scream.  I came back today for the first time in a month to be greeted by the one counter person on the phone with a phone order.  The manager on duty walked past not doing anything and after a 5 minute wait another person came up and took the order.  At this rate it will be awhile before I come back again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  However, it is close to impossible to find a parking spot around lunchtime. Also, people using the free Wi-fi set up shop at the booths during the busiest hours and prevent others from having a place to sit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service very friendly! I wasn't expecting someone to come around and refill my drink! The busser guy was SO nice and always smiling:) I was only slightly disappointed that I had to tell the guy at the counter 3 times that I had never been there before and he still failed to tell me how the place worked. I would have liked more clarification on that. I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by anything I get here! I have my usuals but once in a while i like to order something different and come to find out almost every time whatever i try next turns into my favorite! The pasta, the salad, the bread, the sandwiches the desserts...its all yummy! and they have free WiFi!! 

The environment is great, the service is great, the food is great...what more could you ask for? :o)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for Saturday coffee and breakfast.  They serve good coffee and have a wide variety of breakfast items."}
{"text":"Me and my man come here all the time, we love the food. The Staff is great the food taste good and you never feel rushed to leave. I will say that we did have one problem when the staff kind of forgot to bring us are soup. The manager did apologize right away explaining that it was not OK to have that long of a wait. She then brought us over a second order to go! Letting us know it was on the house just in case we were in a hurry and to say sorry for waiting. That kind of customer service is what keeps us coming back. The only reason i gave it a 4 star is the parking blows during busy hours were its located at has almost no parking which means sometimes we don't get wildflower. That and am not a fan of there cheese cake."}
{"text":"I love there food this is one of favorite places to go for lunch when I am working.  I love all there soups it's what we order most of and there toffee pie omg amazing! But they are busy be warned but I will say one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Kind of similar to Panera bread but much better choices! Lots of exotic flavors. They have a patio area for outdoor eating. We shared the French toast and feta breakfast sandwich. Both were good but the French bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"Much better experience the last few times I've been in there.  I try to avoid peak times   Food is quite good and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great place! Probably one of the best tasting breakfast sandwiches I've had. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love their bread! If you're vegetarian, definitely try fig/goat cheese/sweet potato sandwich. I'm not even vegetarian and I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"#BAW

I have enjoyed my time with the Wildflower Bread Company; especially the support provided to me over the course of my time with, Louis, Jim, Brad and Janine at all the AM meetings.

We change lives, create traditions, build community and feed the soul with passion, every time, every day.

This is the best week of the whole year."}
{"text":"The roasted garlic tomato soup bread bowl is amazing. Every time I go to Wildflower, I oogle the sweets, bear claws and croissants. I have not ordered any yet. I will just stick with the soups and sandwiches for now. The customer service is always great and my coworkers and I can stay and eat as long as we want or eat and run."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Goodyear area. Every single dish I've ever had is good. Try one of the soups. My favorites are the potato cream cheese and the mushroom. I also love their chopped salad with salmon. If you don't like fish, though, you can substitute chicken. The cranberry-oatmeal cookies and the cranberry scones are delectable!"}
{"text":"I just had a delicious breakfast! Shortstack lemon ricotta pancakes with scrambled eggs on the side. The pancakes had just the right amount of lemon and the eggs were scrambled just right. Great service and I like that it's next to a book store as well."}
{"text":"I luv wildflower.  

I've had their chicken pesto pene, the potato soup n bread, ceaser salad,  turkey bree on rye.  
I will eventually try everything on the menu. 

This location is the least busy with the best service."}
{"text":"Don't come hungry- you'll get hungry waiting for your food! I have tried this place several times, due to the location.. However, the food is average, the lattes are bad and it takes forever to get food if there's any crowd. The service is kind but slow."}
{"text":"i was lucky enough to find Wildflower ,stopped in got the butternut squash salad .and cookie.  OMG the salad was the best I ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!  oatmeal,cranberry cookie was also fantastic. Nice staff and pleasant to talk with, I will only stop here
 when in the area. Thanks for a great lunch with plenty of left overs."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich was awesome!  (Meatballs, the bread and sauce!) date night dinner with my daughter...good stuff."}
{"text":"Am I missing something?  Sandwiches were ok - nothing amazing, prices were extremely high, you order at the counter, fill up your drink cup and sit down with your # card. A while later your food gets dropped off. by a random employee.....sort of like Whataburger or Chuck E. Cheese.  I dont see what everyone loves about this place.  Another disappointment was the bread, of all things, was somewhat tough and hard to chew....like if I came with my grandmother she probably couldn't manage kind of hard to chew. 
 Next time, try Jason's Deli or The Lunbag."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying when you order a half salad and an iced tea I did not expect my bill to be almost $10. Its a HALF salad. That said - the chicken caesar is amazing. I hate that it costs what is does, because I would go a couple times a week if it were more reasonably priced. Order takers are pretty robotic, bussers are super busy and I can usually sit next to a dirty table for at least 30 minutes before its cleared. Food comes out super fast and the bathrooms are kept clean. This place is consistently busy (I work next door) so I guess no one but me minds the prices."}
{"text":"Wild Child Bed For Company
By The Rue

My favorite sandwich is the chicken continental,
The toppings on here are pretty fundemental,
You can get something else, I won't be judgemental,
When I give you a hickey I promise to be gentle,
If it's not on your neck it's not accidental,
When I am done it will be something monumental,
Before work, covering up with a scarf is detrimental,
Back to my review the rest is experimental.

If you want something different than chicken, 
I won't give you a hickey but something finger lickin',
The gorgonzola and roast beef will not sicken,
I don't care if your from France or Great Britain,
The herb mayo on sourdough gets the pulse to quicken,
If it were up to me I would name your cat \"Mitten\",
Jim Carey was in a movie called \"Once Bitten\",
This is a great place to eat, hunger now stricken!!

Beatnik!!"}
{"text":"All right, time to give Wildflower some props for good customer service - their founder contacted me, apologized, indicated that more high chairs had been placed at the location, told me he spoke with management and addressed the issue, and invited us to try again with a gift card.  We'll see how it is the next time we go, but in the meantime I'm adjusting my rating to reflect some quality customer care.

EDIT:  Next time we went, there were plenty of high chairs, the food was still great, and they were even cool with me bringing in a Chick-fil-a sandwich to pair with the soup we ordered (no matter how good your sandwiches are, it's hard to beat an amazing $2.99 Chick-fil-a original sandwich).  Well played, Wildflower.  We've been there several times recently and it is becoming a favorite."}
{"text":"Their chicken Caesar salad is sooo delicious!  By far my favorite salad anywhere. So the salad itself gets 5 stars. However, I've had the same exact scenario happen twice with this location. 

I stop by on my way home from work after an exhausting day. I order a Caesar salad without mushrooms and add chicken ($2.69 extra) to go. This part might be my own fault, but in my exhaustion, I forgot both times to double check my order and both times, I have arrived home and... No chicken. 

So I have now paid somewhere around $9 two times for a regular old Caesar salad without the chicken I paid for. I'm too tired to drive back in rush hour traffic and now I must cook some protein at home, which defeats the purpose of getting take out.  Like I said, probably my own fault, but frustrating nonetheless."}
{"text":"great soups and salads. They have seasonal food and specials that changes frequently."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy, with a line for ordering. My friend picked up some sample multigrain bread pieces and butter to munch on, as we waited. The lines moved fast and efficiently. I got a combo of wildflower special salad and a pesto turkey sandwich to go. Both were good. Good café ambiance; had both inside seating and outside patio tables. It appeared to be a notch up from Panera Bread setups. BTW-it is across the Scottsdale resort Plaza. So easy to cross the street and get something to eat from here, if want to have non-resort food."}
{"text":"They've updated the table sizes and arrangement. Great service and outstanding, friendly staff (except for a few that need to work on their people skills). They keep the place very clean."}
{"text":"I go here with coworkers almost once a week.  It is consistently good, fresh food.  I always get the Caesar salad and Cream Cheese Potato Soup and it is excellent.  Service is exceptional, they are always so helpful. friendly, and professional.  Love them!"}
{"text":"Iced coffee?  Perfect.  Banana walnut pancakes?  To die for.  

I can't wait until I'm living in the area so I can eat this all the time and get as big as a house."}
{"text":"Maybe its just today, but I'm disappointed that I came here.  I brought my laptop with me ready to do work while I sip on some coffee.  Typically, I try to make a bathroom break and order food before I set up my laptop.  It actually took 30minutes.  Long wait for the one stall bathroom and when I finally got to the register to order a coffee, the cashier thought it was appropriate to casually give out samples of teas and soups to the customer in front of me, and socialize with the customers while the man shopped in changing hands bookstore and then finalize the purchase when he came back.  The cashier never thought to say, I'll help the customers behind you while you decide your order and shop in the store. There was a child that came up to the counter to ask a question, no acknowledgment, then it looked like her mother came up to the counter.  Again no acknowledgement.  The mother finally lined up behind me in line to get assistance.   The rest of the staff was just starring into space.   I asked if they were understaffed and the cashier said no. She seemed irritated that I was upset."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today and it was awful.  First, they only had one person taking orders.  Second, my pancakes were burnt and so was the bacon.  Sent back the bacon and got fried out bacon the second time.  Also Lemon Ricotta pancakes are suppose to have blueberry compote not cherry.  That is not the worst of it.  My husband was given the wrong breakfast all together.
Have been here many times and wondered why no one was there because it is usually crowded.  I now know why.  Have to find another place for breakfast"}
{"text":"This place is such a go-to breakfast, lunch or dinner spot.  I love having a place like Wildflower for brunch, the atmosphere is welcoming and friendly.  The food is always spot on, and their menu has such a variety of different soups, sandwiches, salads, pasta, and more!  My favorite time to go, if I had to choose one, would be brunch.  You can get breakfast or lunch food, and their pancakes (all three types) are to DIE FOR.  Whenever I go for lunch I always get the potato soup with the pesto chicken sandwich.  What can I say more than YUM YUM?! I love this place so much and I find myself always coming back.  Great food, great atmosphere, great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  I walked in very tired after a flight delay & was extremely pleased by the service provided within this dine. Very friendly staff! Not to mention the food, very delicious! Daniel was very helpful even after working hours, by helping me solve my flight delay issue. Very generous young man! Couldn't thank him enough. (:"}
{"text":"For airport food, this was a decent choice. They allowed me to customize my salad."}
{"text":"We ear here a couple times a week.  A favoritism the V 12 salad!!! Delicious and healthy"}
{"text":"Rude staff.  Unhappy, no \"hello\" or \"thank you.\"  This location could learn from the Arrowhead location.  Food is great."}
{"text":"Rough day at the hospital so I decided  to get some healthy food and I seen Wildflower Bread Company across the street. Walked in the door and the staff was laughing and smiling, just what the doctor ordered, which put me in a calmer mood. Cody came to my table, asked me if I needed anything and I told him water please.  He was very kind and helpful but what I liked most was his positive attitude and caring smile.  Oh, I ordered pasta, it came with fresh garlic bread and the pasta was delicious. I give an A+ to this Wildflower restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place every time! Staff is extremely helpful and always surprises my family and I. In a good way"}
{"text":"Lovely cafe/bakery situated next to an excellent bookstore. Great atmosphere, great service, love their iced tea and potato soup."}
{"text":"Whenever in Arizona, this is a must visit spot. Food is fresh, service friendly and a cut above those chains. It's not a typical breakfast brunch spot but it has never disappointed this foodie from Boston!"}
{"text":"This Wildflower is the best one in AZ ask anyone who lives in Tempe! 
I used to live right by this location at the Cottonwood apartments and my mom would take me here on special occassions. 

I really enjoy this location because the crowd of people that come here are really easy going. You get really great service at this sit down cafe.  

What truly makes Wildflower great? Their food is really delicious and not processed. You get quality food and unique recipes. I loveeee their hot Potato Cream Cheese soup with an order of salad or half a sandwich. Oh! That's another great thing about this place. They give you the freedom to mix match your meal. You can choose half of a sandwich or salad from their huge variety of menu items

A lot of my friends are vegetarians and this is a great spot if your looking for meat free choices. 

SOME OF MY FAVORITE DISHES HERE ARE: 
1.) Butternut Squash Raviloi-I think this one is seasonal. 
It's lightly sweetened and melts like butter. 

2.) Potato Cream Cheese soup in a sourdough bread bowl- The hard crust of the roll keep the soup from spilling out. The inside of the roll is all fluffy and soak in creamy cheesy potato heaven. 

3.) Chinese Chicken Salad- It's a bit sour with the vinegar but the cucumbers and other fresh ingredients balance the tartness of the dressing.

AND CAN YOU SAY BREAKFAST? DELISH! what kind of bakery would this be without bomb pastries?

One last thing is the bookstore \"Changing Hands\" (It is an independent owned bookstore) which is connected to the cafe. It's great because after you order you can feel free to browse the shop. They also get great authors to come and speak about their publications. (Some authors have included Hillary Clinton and  Aron Ralston-Between a Rock and a Hard place) If you ever get a chance to go...Go! You can thank me later.  

Here you will get great bread and books. Does it really get any better than that?"}
{"text":"I just ordered Salmon Alfredo Pasta. It was delicious. The salmon wasn't dry at all, very moist, just how i like it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. 
The staff quite helpful and friendly with the customers. They even offered us water as we were picking up our food.
We did not wait long time to order or to get our food. We got scrambled eggs, bread and potatoes. It was good, maybe the bread could have used little less grilling, but overall good."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time and I've never seen an act of true kindness by any of the employees, until an employee named Taylor stopped what she was doing to help an elderly gentleman out of his seat. He looked as if he was struggling, he had a cane and she stopped talking to a couple of the customers just to see if he needed help. The man tried to offer her money as a thank you and she refused it. We were sitting beside the couple, and heard him ask her name, she is so kind. People like her make dining at Wildflower an experience to remember."}
{"text":"Love their bagels in the morning!

Their sandwiches and salads are fresh."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower Bread restaurants - but I have to complain about the baby kale salad with lemon.  I don't even think there was a full cup of kale, and maybe 2 ounces of chicken.  That's all there was - no other ingredients.  The lemon taste was awesome but for the money, so skimpy.  Big dish with a huge rim and tiny bowl.  A friend ordered the Club sandwich.  So, for the same money, I was left hungry because that should be a side salad, and my friend took half of hers home.  I expect more from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 3- stars and have now changed my review to 4-stars and here's why.... 
The founder of wild bread company acknowledged and replied to my experience that I had regarding poor customer service.  I am greatly impressed for him personally replying. Taking responsibility is huge and a lot of businesses don't do that or they brush it under the rug. I am grateful for him offering to basically replace my experience. My experience and ill feelings were replaced my his reply. I will be going back for another try ( their food was good). The prior experience that I posted my review about... Like I said  - maybe it was just an off day for that specific team member.  
I'm hoping for a 5-star the next time I go in  :) 
I left part of my review on the previous experience below .... 

So I went there today. I ordered two Sunnyside eggs, their potato browns,  and I asked for cinnamon toast and a small coffee.I'm wondering if the lady charged me wrong. The cost seemed pretty high. She told me they didn't have just cinnamon toast. But they have a wheat bread with cinnamon raisins in it. I told her that would be fine. Upon bringing it out I noticed there were several nuts in the bread- which I have a nut allergy. I kindly told her I did not realize this bread had nuts. she stated; \"that's what you ordered, cinnamon wheat nut raisin bread.\" I told her I couldn't eat it as I am allergic and she looked at me like I had a problem and that it was my fault because I ordered that. So she replaced it with a sourdough bread buttered. I didn't like the fact I felt I got poor customer service. Their bussers seemed more helpful - they grabbed the kup she forgot to put on my plate as well. I will say it is a cute place to go to and maybe I just came in on the gals bad day."}
{"text":"Though I generally go for a nice bowl/cup of oatmeal, today I opted to try something new and I'm sure glad I did. I tried the Slow-Roasted Tomato, Feta, and Egg Sandwich....IT WAS EVERYTHING! The feta gave it a real special taste, the bread was perfect, and it wasn't overly buttered. 

I called my order in and it was promptly ready to go by the time I walked through the doors. The staff at this location are always friendly and courteous. I especially appreciate the fact that someone now confirms that my order is correct and all items are accounted for; there have been several instances where key elements were missing (i.e.; jam for my toast, utensils to eat with, no salad dressing, or not enough, for my salad...not sure exactly how that happened, but ok).

I haven't had one bad food item yet! The food is plentiful. I never feel like I overpaid. The customer facing experience is always pleasant. I'm always satisfied. And, it's not junk-food.

I WildCompany!

p.s. I hope Mr. Basile will consider a reward program of sorts; I'd be on a role and working free entree numero veintidos or something like that. Lol"}
{"text":"I LOVE salads and find that the variety here is better than Paradise Bakery. Not only that, I feel that I get what I pay here. Of late, I've been stopping by WFBC in North Scottsdale and ordering a petite Wildflower Salad (it fills me up and it's absolutely delicious).

Today I ordered one for pickup at Chandler Mall and, as an added bonus, a slice of Ginger Biscotti Cheesecake (never had it but looks devine). Upon getting home I was rather disappointed to find that my cheesecake was haphazardly thrown into it's package and in pieces....I can't tell if I got the whole slice or half. I immediately called the manager when I got home, she was very apologetic and offered a gift card for the mishap (I'll be picking that up this weekend ).

I'm always satisfied with the service I receive from WFBC and the quality of their food. Though this incident was disappointing (I was looking forward to devouring that cheesecake), my salad is absolutely wonderful! 

I will continue to patronize WFBC."}
{"text":"I love all Wildflowers! They are very consistent with their service and quality. Order the tomato feta and egg sandwich on toasted rye! It's my favorite! Salads, sandwiches and desserts are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Great healthy food.  Our go to weekend lunch spot.  Thanks Jenna for the great service!"}
{"text":"Visisted for the first time today during the lunch rush. It was caotic. It was so busy, there were no tables but we were handed our \"take a seat ticket thingy\" so we ended up having to sit at a ittle coffee table. The sandwhich we ordered was decent but was not worth $8. We got drinks and they charged us $3 for one fo those cups that you get out of office building water containers(about 10 oz). We ordered a pretzel whcih was hard. The staff is nice but they need to have so sort of control on seating and people. The place was way over occupancy, it was so crowded a lady pushed right into me and I spilled my drink all over myself. It was ok, but I won't go back again."}
{"text":"Pretty corporate place. Like a panera. Good breakfast Sammy, nice service but nothing over the top nice about the place. Good for refueling."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is delicious and healthy. Just a bit loud sometimes and people sit there for hours using the free WIFI."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for 10 people in my office at 11:45 it was ready in 10 minutes! Super impressed. Everyone was friendly and they even helped me take the food to the car unlike their neighbors Pita Jungle. Also, the cranberry turkey sandwich was delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been there to breakfast in awhile and didn't realize that they had changed the bread on the sausage and egg sandwich until they had brought it to us.  We also ordered the wrong type of sausage and realized it when it was brought to us. The staff quickly made are order right and did so without making us feel the least bit uncomfortable. Really appreciate their desire to satisfy the customer, even when it was their mistake.  Will keep going back. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing and the service is even better!! The manager always checks out about if people are enjoying their meals! I work at the mall and eat here everyday and defiantly think that this is one of the best places to eat in the US! Thank u."}
{"text":"I'm a fiend for breakfast foods, and pretty much anything sweet and bread like.  Wildflower Bread Company is the perfect forum to satisfy my pancake, French toast, soup, and sandwich needs.  

The lemon ricotta pancakes and the cinnamon raisin-nut French toast are the perfect carb-heavy way to start off a day.  Plus, Wildflower's iced-coffee is quite good and free flowing.  So if you need to cut the sweetness, or need a caffeine jolt, have at it.

As I said, the soups and sandwiches are also great options.  Everything from the chicken continental to the ham and Swiss sandwiches are fantastic.  Their fresh breads are an integral part of what makes this a great place to get sandwiches. 

My only complaint is the restaurants' overly friendliness to loiterers.  I understand that at some point earlier in the day, the person who ordered that 1 coffee and refilled it 7 times paid for that 1 coffee.  But now there are no tables and the new paying customers are left in the lurch due to the lack of seating.  It's too bad that people seem to have lost the common sense that after a certain point it's appropriate to move on and free up tables so that other patrons can actually eat.  Yes, I'm staring you... the two old ladies lingering over iced water and breadcrumbs and empty plates, and you, the 22 year-old with the milky iced-coffee and laptop computer - pack it up!"}
{"text":"So after the communication from management we gave Wildflower another try! McClintock & Guatalupe. 

The ladies at the counter were really friendly and helped us make the most of our order. They obviously enjoy working with the public.

We ordered the Hummus Plate, Kid's Linguine with pesto on the side, the Turkey & Brie sandwich an of course our son had a giant pretzel. The hummus plate was great, but the Turkey Brie was fantastic. We really enjoyed our meal. The best part were the four little pumpkin pie bites they brought to us. I only got a tiny bite they were so good the kids gobbled them up, pardon the Thanksgiving pun, couldn't resist. 

The restaurant was clean with plenty of room to navigate with children. The staff was friendly and in a great mood every one of them!  Thanks for a great pre-movie family meal!"}
{"text":"I love Wildflower. Who needs Panera or Paradise Bakery, this place is so much better. Lemon ricotta pancakes are awesome. Other breakfast items and sandwiches are consistently good. Love free coffee refills and free newspapers.

One caveat: I heard they used to make the soups at each restaurant but now they have shifted to making these offsite. The soups are not nearly as good as they used to be...  bring back the white cheddar poblano please."}
{"text":"We went to Wildflower for lunch today and the sandwiches were great. The real shining star was the service though. This is a bread company/Sandwich shop etc. I never expected this level of service. In fact I asked the manager if this was a franchise as it was so well ran! He response \"No\" \"This is a family business\"! My daughter ordered a chicken Pesto Sandwich which is served on a ciabatta bread which has a hard outer crust and soft middle. She loved the sandwich but the bread was difficult to bite through. 

I mentioned this to a gentleman who was working the floor and he said that this type of bread can be hard on the outside but offered a soft bread choice to finish the sandwich with. She was almost finished and declined the offer and said that was fine we finished. He also went back to the kitchen to make sure they were properly prepared. He continued to offer alternatives and finally provided a comp to make sure we were happy. Wow!

The bottom line is this company is special. They know how to make killer sandwiches with over the top service. Awesome and thank you!"}
{"text":"A great go to place, with very tasty breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. Fresh and tasty high quality ingredients. All that work here are a great example of stellar customer and food service. We'll be back whenever we are staying at hotels nearby."}
{"text":"Wow these folks know customer service!  We like the fact there are always managers on the floor keeping things moving and tables clean.  Food is good and at a good price point.  A nice friendly well run place!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Phoenix on route to LA. Had quinoa salad with their award winning sour dough bread. Very good."}
{"text":"I so don't usually do places like this but I have to say it's pretty damn good. The service is great, the prices are very reasonable and the food is awesome.

I have a friend who always wants to meet here and I went for my second time today. I had the ham and cheese sandwich with the tomato bread salad- kicked ass.... and it was like $7!

The service has been really good both times I've been, the people that bring the food to you have a real smile, and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer. 

I am so sick of going to places that are so busy being really cool and overpriced that they forget to give you good food so this place is refreshing- Score Wildflower Bread Company!"}
{"text":"A great place to get a reasonably priced meal. Very casual, as you order at the counter and they bring the food to wherever you sit. They offer meals with different combinations, such as a sandwich with figs, celery, sweet potatos, fennel, etc. Would go back to try other things!"}
{"text":"It goes without saying, Wild Flower has the BEST bread around! Absolutely have to try the rosemary sea salt bread; I cannot stop eating it. lol Seriously, this place has mastery of their product; however, a 1 star deduction was merited as a result of customer service and staff behavioral deficiencies. 

On two separate occasions aggravation was experienced impart by either server error or cook error. The server error incident was degraded worse when Mr. Calm (the 23 yr baby face manager) comes out and tries to deescalate an already calm, but confusing situation; in which I did not receive an entire lunch order in 20 mins of repeated inquires to the server. 

Mr. Calm finally discovered the server didn't put my order in, as it was \"lost.\" Couldn't say I really cared about where my order was at that point.... Additionally, Mr. Calm was a close-talker... It was so helpful with him calmly talking to me, in my face. 

Good news, I was eventually comped with a $15 gift card, in which I was content, but still starving. I promptly went to Subway, consumed an inferior sandwich, and my hunger was satisfied with mediocrity. So sad...lol

Anyway, I highly recommend Wild Flower, but NOT M-F during lunch. 

Pro Tip: ALWAYS call to order bread, as the most popular breads will often be sold out."}
{"text":"A Sunday brunch connoisseur cannot ever get blown away by this place. 

I will not complain about the ambience, it is indeed pretty. But I'm definitely not going to vouch for the food here. I don't know if this has something to do with the Chandler location but nothing on the menu is upto the mark.

When you look at the menu it sounds grander than it actually is. Believe me when I say that the pancake or french toast looks far more appetizing at IHOP. I'd suggest that you spend 10 mins preparing the Potato and Leek packet soup (by Knorr) at home rather than taste any of their creamy soups.

During the shopping season they put novices behind the cash counters and take inordinately long to serve a plate that totally falls short of your expectations.

A strategic location or good interiors does not make for a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast and lunch quite often... Absolutely loving the Carmelized cauliflower linguini! Superb! It's new on the menu and outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We usually visit Scottsdale a couple times a year and stay across the street.  Our kids love the cookies and the friendly folks that work there.  During our last trip, May saw I had my hands full with the kids and really went the extra mile to help get us to a table.  She even had some recommendations for new things to do around town."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I have been to several locations and ordered many different salads.  The chopped salad is amazing....it is also super clean.  Like the special touches such as hand lotion in the ladies' bathroom and yummy different breads served with each meal."}
{"text":"The very best cranberry scones I EVER had.  Not too sweet, satisfying texture and chewy cranberries.  When I told the girl how great they were she gave me one on the house. Edwin is the baker.  Terrific..."}
{"text":"I just adore this place. My Food is premiere, the environment is nice, staff friendly. 
I typically get the same order. The egg breakfast which comes with home fries and toast. I like my potatoes well done, and they get it just right every time. I also love the banana walnut pancakes. 
The coffee is good, music good, atmosphere good, people seem to enjoy here, so why wouldn't you?

Every now and then, you can catch a celeb here enjoying themselves as well. Susan Lucci, Richard Gere, and Brad Cooper to name a few. 

I'd plan ahead if you want to avoid the masses. For a relaxing meal, I'd shoot for a late breakfast usually around 10-1030a"}
{"text":"Great catering job today!  The entire group loved it.  Thank you to Mishelle at the Tempe location for her personal attention toward making sure our orders are always great, every time."}
{"text":"Incredible pancakes: banana walnut, lemon ricotta, blueberry & brown sugar, or just plain if you're a total lame-oid. Amazing French toast, too: cinnamon raisin, or stuffed with whipped cream cheese & blueberry compote if you wanna be a gluttonous pig like me. Be a gluttonous pig like me! Be a gluttonous pig like me!

The breakfast sandwiches are good, too - but not nearly as indulgent :(

Reasonably priced too, everything on the breakfast menu is right around 6 bucks."}
{"text":"I love their:
Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - fluffy pancakes that have a slight zing of lemon to them, topped with a delicious blueberry sauce. It's perfectly balanced, with the sweetness and the tartness both in wonderful proportions!
Banana Walnut Pancakes - fluffy pancakes with a walnut-y crunch in them, and some lovely banana flavors too. Personally, I adore the taste and texture of bananas, so I love pancakes with them too! And these are really, really good pancakes...
Asian Chicken Salad - I also love Asian salads, so... Anyways, they give you a generous portion of chicken, and a bit too much dressing for my liking - ask for it on the side if you're not a huge dressing fan. Also, the crunchy won-ton things aren't really my thing, so you can ask to remove them or have them on the side if you like. But the jicama and carrots they put in it give a great crunchy texture, and the dressing is a really good one, with a great flavor (just a little too much of it ) 
Their pastas and sandwiches are good too, I just can't describe them in detail because I haven't had them repeatedly. 
Definitely would recommend for breakfasts, brunches, and dinners!"}
{"text":"My wife has been trying to get me to head to Wildflower for some time. She says she could eat here almost every day. Both of us finally went here for lunch.  I've been brought into the Wildflower inner circle.

I was impressed by my Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich. The sandwich tasted great. This is the best roast beef sandwich I've had. The roast beef was very tender and had no fat and paired perfectly with the gorgonzola cheese.. The sourdough bread was very tasty and not hard. The veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and crispy.

As a side, I received a pasta salad. I typically don't like pasta salad, but this was very good. I just wish there was more of it. The side consisted of about 2 forkfuls of pasta. 

Even though we went around peak lunch hour, our food was brought to us within 5 minutes of our order.

A sandwich and side is just under $7.

I was very pleased with my lunch. I'll head back and try some other items in the near future."}
{"text":"I love traveling so much because you find great spots with delicious food. Today it's a cute \"panera\" like restaurant. I choose the wildflower salad and all I have to say it's fresh, nutritious, fast and delicious! I wish North Carolina had one. Perfect for staying on track while traveling. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to express just how frustrating it is to perpetually give a restaurant a chance in hopes that they won't keep screwing up take-out orders and still have them do it CONSTANTLY. I've been eating at this location for 3ish years, and tonight marks easily the 11th or 12th time I've had my order screwed up (chicken missing from a salad, certain meats missing from a sandwich, etc.) and I'm done hoping it will stop. If you are wanting to eat at a restaurant that actually gets orders right, this is not your place. Not sure if they need a change in management or just competent cooks, but hopefully something changes."}
{"text":"Cuban chicken sandwich was delicious, only wish the one side of the toasted rye wasnt soggy.   The Orzo was enjoyed by my 18 month old!  She loved it!  Iced tea is always the best, love the new refillable cups!"}
{"text":"Like a better version of Panera.. The 9 grain bread was delicious and fresh. The chicken salad sandwich was interesting with jicama, but good. I liked their sunflower salad, though it was a bit too heavily dressed. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chinese chicken salad, and asked for ranch dressing instead of the traditional dressing. The guy behind the counter accommodated me without missing a beat! Very friendly and personable. 
They give you a good amount of salad for the price, and it comes with the tastiest bread ever! 
The place was clean too. I noticed that each time someone got up - an employee was there to wipe the table down and sweep under it. 
I look forward to eating there again the next time I go through the PHX airport."}
{"text":"At first I have pretty hesitant to try Wildflower, but my girlfriend assured me I would be pleased. In my mind I imagined a hipsters paradise next to the Changing Hands bookstore that I really would disapprove of going to. Trusting her knowledge of my stomach, I went with her there one night for dinner. Boy was I wrong. Wildflower is filled with young professionals, students, and other local members of the community and is pretty anti hipster *phew*. 

At the rear of the restaurant is their counter and cashier station. The counter is filled with such amazing treats, and on wooden shelves behind here are dozens of freshly baked loaves of bread. The best part is that on fridays they have challah! 

For lunch of dinner, I order the 1/2 sandwich and soup special. While they change their soup selection daily (they usually have around 4 choices), I generally order the chicken noodle and the almond tuna sandwich. This sandwich is very delicious. My girlfriend loves their pesto pasta with chicken, but they only serve it during the dinner hours.

For $7.25 you get a great meal that will convince you to come back for more."}
{"text":"We went there tonight after a day of moving house! Tired and hungry! Somehow my order got mix up!
And I got a chicken salad sandwich instead of a chicken parmigiana sandwich ! Being hungry I ate it and mentioned it to the manager Frank! Who offered me a free sandwich of my original order! 

So my wife
Loved her salad and I loved the sandwiches and I am happy I found a new sincere place of good food around the corner from our new house!

Did I mentioned that I am German! They have fantastic bread too!!!'

Thanks Frank !!!!

You got yourself some new regulars! What a nice surprise and a kind of welcome to the new hood!

We will be back ....a lot!!!"}
{"text":"Better than expected.  I am not usually one into having anything outside of a standard sandwhich, but things have changed.  Great glowing atmosphere with an AWESOME turkey rueben.  Try it and wish you had a second one."}
{"text":"Love it!
The food is yummy and everyone is so nice.
Oh boy and the smell of fresh bake bread ,cookies and all the yummy food they make in there is amazing ..so good! :]"}
{"text":"Simply exceptional. Good food, great quality, great service. Great atmosphere - very relaxed and quiet. Good place to think or have a chat with spouse or friend."}
{"text":"Serviceable. More affordable than most airports food options but nothing inspiring. Mushroom barley soup clearly comes from a bag."}
{"text":"In the Northeast, Wildflower doesn't exist. I guess it's most like a Panera? Even if not, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a perfect lunch spot! Extra points because they bring your food to you, instead of having to wait around and find seating once your food is finished being prepared.

As far as recommendations go, the carrot & ginger soup was really spectacular. I also got the sweet potato sandwich, which had delicious dressing. The man I was with had 3 lattes, so I guess he liked those too! If I ever see one again, I'd stop in!"}
{"text":"I just had the Vegetable Quinoa. It was awesome!  It had dried peas and corn plus tons of other healthy yet tasty ingredients. 

The wait was about 15 minutes. It was a bit longer than I expected it to be, but worth every minute. I'll definitely be sure to stop here again the next time I pass through the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"I love the food and have never been to this location and never will go back to this location. My mother and I both got our usual lunch time items and we ended up being sick the rest of the day and into the following day and we had diagnosed food poisoning, plus that was all we ate the entire day. I will stick with the location in Scottsdale where we usually go but never this location again."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and I have to say I was not quite happy with the service but I decided to give this place a second try and I loved it!! The food was great! The lovely cashier (Ashton) was great she read back my order to make sure everything was to my satisfaction! Very kind friendly and welcoming! The server (Francisco) did a great job. Very kind and fast. In a matter of minutes I got my food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This location is very nice and always has great take out service. I usually go with the hummus plate and one of the soups. The bread that they give with their salads are definitely worth the drive! 
The cupcakes are sub--par so don't waste your money on them!"}
{"text":"I spent 30 min in-store for a to go order. All I ordered were 2 salads. Not only didn't it take 25+ min to finally get my salads, there was a couple I happen to notice who walked in, ordered, and got their hot food (think they got sandwiches and soup) before I got my order, mind you they came in and ordered after I had already sat to wait for my food. Plus when I get home it turns out my order of just 2 salads was wrong. I had asked and paid for extra dressing and sides of bread, I also asked for mushrooms to be left out one of the salads, but all my requests were ignored. Don't get me wrong, I like wildflower and I've been there many times in the past but this is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Is it my imagination or has the amount of home fries they serve been significantly reduced? I was there for breakfast this morning and ordered their Honey-cured ham and brie frittata, which was excellent, but it seemed to me that there were only half as many home fries as usual. Also, had to tell them they had run out of their house blend coffee. This is not the first time I have been there and they have run out of their house blend. Don't get me wrong, I love this place. Their vegetarian lentil soup is fantastic. I just hope they don't start cutting corners and can keep up the good work.."}
{"text":"I want to give a huge shout out I visited for the first time today a friend told me it rocked  I visited for lunch and placed my order with a female manager with with red hair and as I went for my wallet I realized I left it back at work and without hesitating she offered to pay for my meal I was Impressed I am now telling all my friends how great this place is I am sorry I did not get her name so I could recognize her!! I have never had that kind of service thanks Wildflower"}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccino and help with getting on the web.
Thanks to Wendy.  Very friendly service.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. Great place to relax while enjoying a meal. My favorite is the chicken continental sandwich, their honey mustard is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place! the food is great and so is the service. I've been here numerous times and I have always had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I love wildflower bakery.  Fresh baked bread, a good handful of delicious vegetarian options, and a friendly staff.  I'm a frequent patron and have had lunch, dinner and breakfast from this establishment.  Their breakfasts are all incredible (however, for hang over food, stick to fili b's,  this place flirts with a healthy breakfast), their salads are savory and the sandwiches are great.  The Walnut cream butternut squash ravioli is to DIE for.  Plus, plenty of bread for sopping up extra sauce to boot!"}
{"text":"There are just too many choices on the menu, and everything sounds so good.  Its one of those good problems, because everything I've tried has been delicious.  The food is also very reasonable price considering the high quality of the ingredients.

I usually get a sandwich; the roast beef and gorgonzola, spicy meatball, and braised beef are all terrific, and my wife loved the roasted sweet potato sandwich.  They have a rotating selection of several soups, and the corn and green chile bisque was outstanding.

And then there's breakfast, which is served until 2 on the weekend (awesome).  I love the sausage and egg sandwich, and the home fries, but you can't go wrong with the frittatas, french toast or pancake varieties (including lemon ricotta).  They pour a good cup of coffee, including espresso drinks, and the scones are another favorite of my wife.

With this establishment being a bakery, there is a large selection of delicious breads and pastries to take home, also at a decent price.

There's not too much to say about the service.  You place your order at the counter, and they bring it out to you.  Sometimes they are slow to clear the tables.

My stomach is growling just writing this review.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  What do you say Yelp, how about half stars?"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I have gone twice and both times the food has been over priced and lackluster, to say the least. The first time I went I ordered the Mixed Berry French toast. $9 for two slices of bread covered in berry compote and lemon curd... Kay. The berry compote was runny and the lemon curd was thick and had a gross consistency... Not appetizing at all. I actually don't think I even finished eating it and that's saying a lot considering French toast is my favorite breakfast. The second time I went I ordered the Sweet Potatoes and Greens Breakfast Bowl. Barf. Raw egg over a handful of spinach leaves and a few sprinkles of sweet potatoes and other vegetables scattered throughout. For a menu item with \"sweet potatoes\" in the title you'd think they would actually put more sweet potato in it. To top it off there were bits of egg shell in a few bite! I almost gagged. This place is sloppy, over priced, and stingy. The only reason they got two starts from me is because the bread is good. Other than that- I will not patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"While visiting last March we tried this place and liked it enough to search it out again and were not disappointed.  

We like the atmosphere and find it friendly and the staff kept the tables clean.  

The food is tasty and of good quantity however the newly featured sandwich that was promoted was sold out so minus one star.  

My wife tried a paste dish and found it tasty while I tired a grilled turkey pastrami.  My sandwich tasted very good but I struggled with the contents falling out including the honey mustard which left a stick mess.

Next time we are in this area we will return."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I have EVER eaten is their seasonal Thanksgiving sandwich. I wish they had it all year long. I have searched online and cannot seem to find when they start serving it but know it ends at Thanksgiving. Their lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for. I have never had a bad dish, though I agree with some reviews that at times I have waited 20-30 minutes for my food which seems ridiculous when you are not receiving waiter service. I have actually left the line before when it was apparent the line was long with only one cook making food. He actually sighed as the tickets printed out...poor guy. Not always a quick place to eat when wanting takeout or a quick meal."}
{"text":"Food here is good for sure. Service is great. However every time I eat here I get some kind of food poisoning as well as other people I know. Even though its good I avoid eating here now."}
{"text":"Great place to eat brunch or lunch! They have lots of selection for salads, sandwiches and pasta. They have 'select two' option for people like me who wants half a sandwich and a salad or a soup. The servers are always friendly and helpful. The lady who took my order asked if I wanted some water while waiting for my takeout. Now that's nice!"}
{"text":"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded \"hover over a table to get a seat\" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded \"Panera Bread\" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a \"mass produced\" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The \"side of pancakes\" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!"}
{"text":"I went at noon and they were pretty busy. The staff were very patient with a patron that was holding up the line to order. Although I wanted the line to move quickly, I thought it was a nice staff gave this gentleman time to figure out what he wanted to order without making him feel rushed. Once i placed my order, it was less than ten minutes and my order was packed up and ready to go. The big downfall at this location is that there is not seating available during high peak hours for those picking up their to-go orders; you end up standing around trying to stay out of the way."}
{"text":"They get it right 90% of the time and it is great. They do flub up sometimes and usually fix it no problem. Over all it is very yummy and healthy. I love their salads."}
{"text":"Coffee watered down.  Salad was lettuce with some lemon on it. Terrible service.  Food is worse."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast at the chandler mall location while in town.  Ordered two kids meals and the banana walnut pancakes. 

Kids meals were perfect, scrambled not fried egg in the sandwich and easily handled, and dipped, pancakes.  As any parent can tell you not having to stop and chop up food before you can eat is awesome.

Banana walnut pancakes were delicious.

Staff was friendly and accommodating.

I will definitely visit next time we're in town and recommend to local friends and family."}
{"text":"I like to go here for pancakes on the weekend and their pastas for dinner. I wish that there was more consistency in the employees. With the exception of Aaron who is extremely helpful most of the staff moves around. I worked at a place like this for years up the street and one of the nice things is getting to know the staff if you're a regular customer. This place doesn't let you do this."}
{"text":"I eat here at least three times a week. They have the best salads under the sun and their bread is always so good. Try the chopped salmon salad or the Mediterranean salad, those two are my favorite.  The restaurant is always busy which is a pain but it's always clean. And they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Try the potato cream cheese bread bowl or chicken pesto sandwich. Then relax in Changing Hands afterward..perfect date night!"}
{"text":"You must try two things: the potato cream cheese bread bowl, and the chicken pesto sandwich.  And your child will LOVE their grilled cheese.  (I may or may not have ordered it myself a few times!)
Great drinks too. This is a perfect place to eat in the mall...it's away from the food court and noise."}
{"text":"One of the better locations, this is a great lunch spot with new seasonal entries every few months. Sandwiches in the afternoon and pasta in the evening, they also have a great bakery assortment and of course, local bread. 
You will be waiting for a table during the peak lunch hour though so try and time your visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get a salad! The Mediterranean salad is always great and never lets me down when I want to eat healthy and satisfying my appetite!"}
{"text":"I'm always around the neighborhood and I love stopping by here because the food is so delicious. I really love the salmon Caesar salad and the turkey pastrami sandwich"}
{"text":"Went back to Arcadia's Wildflower Bread Company today for a farewell lunch for a coworker.  I started Weight Watchers on Sunday, so I prepared by going to the Wildflower website and calculating the \"points\" from their nutrition pages.  Thanks, Wildflower, for making that info available.  But, Holy Cats!  My friend had urged me to try their salads, which she loves.  The two salads for which I calculated \"points\" totalled 22 and 23 points.  My daily total is 29 points.  And salad is not great as a leftover.  I ended up with the vegetarian lentil soup.  I could eat the bread with butter and my total was still only 11 points.  Plus, I tried a new soup and am now a big fan of the tasty veggie lentil.  Parking was once again a challenge, but I was on my motor scooter, which enables me to improvise parking."}
{"text":"3 stars at best. More if you love bakery chains. Service was splendid. Staff friendly, prompt and attentive. Had the turkey pastrami sandwich. Bit wet for me. Really liked the spicy mustard, but can't figure out what makes it pastrami.  I think I might have had better success with the salad. In any case....choose wisely."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is amazing! The smell of fresh bread wafted out the door as we walked in. The menu has so many options. I loved the amount of healthy and local offerings. Six of us came in together and we all cleaned our plates. Clean and comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. Don't even get me started on the fresh out of the oven scones (yum!) if I could give these guys ten stars, I'd give them eleven! Go now, if you like good food, you won't be disappointed! Big thanks to Reuben for treating us like family!"}
{"text":"I adore Wildflower! I've been coming here for years upon years and can honestly say it has satisfied me every visit. During easter season, their hot cross buns are absolutely delicious, not to mention their bread all throughout the year. My favorite are their tangy lemon bars and fresh pies. Nice to have a bakery like this in Arizona."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Fairly priced food that compares to paradise bakery but their food is much better in comparison.  Their fresh bread and salads really stand out vs their competition."}
{"text":"Only vegan-friendly place in terminal 4 and the food is excellent, great service and chill atmosphere. The vegan quinoa salad is great! Coffee drinks don't charge extra for soy (i.e. \"Vegan tax\")). I will be back!"}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches and soups. They make all of their own bread, and have many original choices. The roast beef gorgonzola is awesome!"}
{"text":"Customer service is not available at this location. Not only do the employees give attitude when you are double checking ingredients to make sure an item you are allergic to isn't included. But when you are finally able to sit down at a table you spend your meal being bumped again and again by the young work staff cutting through the tables instead of walking around to the outside. The whole time we were here there wasn't even a presence of a manager on duty to even give them the heads up. Also I know we all love our social media and communications but if you are on the clock- leave your phone in the back and be available for the guest that you are ignoring... 

Come on Scottsdale you can do better than this."}
{"text":"How I adore this charming cafe! The service is provided  by such a friendly staff. And, it's The perfect atmosphere to get cozy and chat away with a friend. A really delightful place to grab lunch. And, yes it will be a wonderful lunch. The bread is amazing- can definitely tell it's baked fresh. The sandwiches always amaze and the drinks are refreshing and delicious.  I love going here and recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great neighborhood hangout, free wifi, friendly staff. A+"}
{"text":"Wildflower cafe is a favorite of mine. Every time we come they have some interesting new soup to try and plenty of vegetarian choices if you're so inclined. I love the wildflower salad with a scoop of tuna to top it off. Oh only complaint was that we had to give our name and email address to use the free WiFi."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! First of all, I have only been to this location once out of MANY times when they had not ran out of the chocolate chip bagel. Of course again today they were out (which I found out after waiting in line for over 15 minutes without my order being taken) then Waited over 15 minutes for a different bagel and a bowl of soup. once I got to work figured out that there was no bagel in the bag! Which is extremely disappointing considering that was going to be the only chance I had for food my entire 8 hour shift. And the soup was for a coworker. Anyways so I called them and they were very condensing, I understand it isnt the end of the world that my bagel wasn't in the bag but considering I won't have food for 8 hours and waited in total about 30 minutes for a simple bagel and soup, it is frustrating that my complaint was not taken seriously or professional. There were also multiple people while I was in the store complaining about how long they had waited in line before getting to order and all the people waiting for the to go order where complaining about how long it was taking. And when I heard a man complain they were rude to him as well. Therefore, I know it is not only me that they were unprofessional with."}
{"text":"I wish there were more Wildflower Bread Company's around.  It has good soups (daily vegetarian selection), free wifi, and bread.  What more could a person want from a (local) chain?  Well...I would like breakfast served all day.  Is that wrong?"}
{"text":"Frank, the manager, was incredibly friendly and attentive to all the folks in the dining room.  I had work to do for a few hours, so I watched as the whole restaurant was well attended to.  Had the Chicken Thai salad...excellent.  And the feedback I offered to Frank about the place was well received.  I truly appreciate personal and GOOD customer service!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is consistently great here at a reasonable price, and if you go to the Val Vista and Baseline store the customer service you will get from Hector is second to none"}
{"text":"My family goes here all the time for breakfast and lunch and it's 4/5 times phenomenal. It's always fresh. Evan is always nice and very accommodating. We like the Banana Walnut Pancakes and the Egg Breakfast, along with the Pesto Chicken and Buffalo Chicken sandwiches. Sometimes the bread is too hard but they are always willing to switch it out for you. Awesome meal!"}
{"text":"OMG such great service. Great counter service and a very nice young man helping to top off drinks, clear tables, etc. The nicest thing is he isn't afraid to interact with Customers. His name is Jacob and he just made a long trip less daunting. Thanks for hiring such great people."}
{"text":"I love this place for coffee and a roll. Gotta go early to secure the prime real estate (booth). The service can be troublesome and it gets really crowded but for me the early morning coffee atmosphere makes up for it. Big, open, warm, with self serve coffee refills and a patio.  Similar but larger than the Paradise Bakery in Ocotillo.

If you sleep in forget about going to either one of these places. The crowded hassle is not worth it."}
{"text":"We always enjoy Wildflower Bread Companys food. Always fresh and delicious.  Today there is a long wait. Bit we were informed before we ordered leaving us the choice of staying or going elsewhere.  We chose to stay."}
{"text":"Back to one of my favorite eateries. Thank you Wildflower Bread Company. Love your food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, great service and food.  Also great atmosphere with nice patio area.  I recommend the soup and sandwhich combo.  My favorite soup here is the French Onion, but there many good options.  On the sandwich side you cant go wrong with any of there options."}
{"text":"More than fast food, less than a diner. I love the salads, soups, and ESPECIALLY the Salmon Pasta dish. I always get their lemonaid anf iced tea and love that this location is attached to Changing Hands."}
{"text":"For a vegetarian person it was awesome sandwich.
Customer service is super cool. They emailed me receipts when i forgot to collect."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great pricing and awesome customer service. Great for a sit down meal, or grabbing a bagel to go. Come here at least 2 times a week."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a great tasting soup or sandwich.  The bread choices are all delicious and they have a variety of soups that change daily.  The staff is friendly and you can tell they really like being there and they are happy that you dropped in.  I have had more attention here than some restaurants that you would expect great service at.

They also have free wi-fi which is always good."}
{"text":"Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, love Wildflower. For breakfast the stuffed french toast is awesome, lunch any of their sandwiches are good. I don't really care for the salads but I love the Potato cream cheese soup. The ice tea is so good and the desserts are wonderful. My favorite thing is the Salmon Alfredo, that they serve with yummy garlic toast. 

I like the order at the front and they bring it to you, very convenient and I don't have to tip!"}
{"text":"Really 4.5 stars. We went for breakfast and it was excellent. Food was fresh and very good. We had the sweet potato, spinach, feta and egg bowl and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Both were excellent. And we are pretty finicky breakfast customers. Coffee was fresh and good and service and staff were very nice and hustling. Highly recommend. Why not 5 stars? It's counter service for ordering which didn't bother us at all, but if you are looking for sit down wait service with refills etc... just know this isn't it."}
{"text":"My family gets take out from here at least once a week. We love the salads, the soups and the pancakes. My one complaint is that they are often out of certain soups by 6-6:30 pm. My favorite is chicken basil chili but I can hardly ever get it because they are always out by dinner."}
{"text":"There is always a long line at this location, mainly because there are never enough employees manning the registers and they are also expected to answer the phone and make drinks. Today it was almost out the door because the few employees who were at the register seemed to be chatting and not really paying attention to the line. By the time I paid $10 for breakfast I was frustrated, but ready for a good meal. Unfortunately I didn't get that: the eggs looked like they had been scraped from the bottom of the pan and the bacon was swimming in a pool of grease. I sat at a dirty table (there were no clean ones available) and ate a meal that wasn't worth half what I paid for it. I am extremely disappointed and will not make the mistake of coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend for a business meeting.  Was thrilled that they had outlets for our computers as they were almost dead.  A huge plus!  I had the beef sandwich and it was very very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The bread was very soft and not a disappointment for a bakery like Paradise was.  They had really good iced tea, though I didn't catch the name of the brand.  I prefer the counter service now over having a server, though they lack an organized line or signs as to how their multiple counters work.  Maybe a rope system or something to help when it's busy may guide people where to go?  The only other thing that didn't overwhelm me was the cinnamon roll that I got to go.  It was huge, but wasn't very soft.  Maybe it was because I got it to go and is better fresh in the store.  All in all, the outlets for the computers saved our meeting and the sandwich was delicious.  We will definitely be back for another lunch meeting."}
{"text":"So I totally spaced out the other day I go to wild flower for lunch and I forgot my wallet!!! What an embarrassment,  I had ordered and reached for my wallet and there was nothing there.  I explained to the girl working the register my dilemma and that I would run home and be back in 10-15 minutes. And she said no. So I replied with some confusion \"what\".  She said that it would not be necessary.  She told me that she would take care of it and I replied that it would not be necessary.  And her response was it was on wildflower and the next time I come just bring a friend and pay it forward.  And I said deal.  I have to tell you that It is very rare in this world that there isn't someone waiting to degrade you or belittle you for the mistakes that we make.  I would like to thanks the girl working the register (Josie) I think was her name and I would like to thank wildflower for not only give me a meal but saving me the time, gas, and hassle of driving home.  I normally go to wildflower for the food. Now it's definitely for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"I went there today to join the desert yarnies meetup.  Anthony took my order and directed me to where the yarnies sit.  He delivered my yummy bagel and addressed me by name 3 times,; when he took my order, delivered my order and when I left.  I only regret that I gave a fake name.  My name is hard to pronounce and spell so I always give an easier name in those situations ie Starbucks etc.  I'm sorry Anthony, you are so nice I'll fess up next visit."}
{"text":"I'll just say it, I like Paradise more.

The reason for this is simple; they don't forget to put my order in, and then BS me to claim that there were other orders in front of ours that came in 20 minutes after we did.

I know you're lying to me when you give me a $10 gift card \"because of being slow.\" Slow I can live with, I lived in New Orleans, but being lied to is something I can't abide.

I had the roast beef sandy. Eh, not bad, not great. Again, Paradise was just better. The slaw that came with it as a side, while a nice surprise, was nothing I really would want to eat. 

Its too much of a trek to get there, y'all bull shitted me, and your food isn't that great. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. We can't get fooled again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could pack up this restaurant and take it back to St. Louis! From the interesting menu, delicious food, delightful ambience and wonderful customer service this place is first rate. Well done, WBC. Well done!"}
{"text":"I think 4 stars is fair. The lettuce on my salad is fresh and the red bell peppers are crunchy. My favorite is the kale salad but tonight I opted for the chopped salad instead. My kids love the potato cream cheese soup. The coffee was lukewarm but the gal at the counter fixed the problem right away. The food and service is always good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wildflower has the best soup options in town! It's easy to find something healthy on the menu. I have never had anything bad from here. Their bread is extremely moist and probably one of the best breads I have had."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the price is high.  I'm an educator, my average lunch cost is $3, not $12 but it was GOOD, so good.  I get the soup/salad combo, I like the Mediterranean salad and potato cream cheese soup, tomato Florentine and chicken lemon vegetable soup so much that I travel there in 112 degree heat for a pipping hot bowl.  The staff is patient and well groomed, after a day of snotty noses, pee pee pants, enormous attitudes and ear holes my dog can jump through, I need civility.  I can't bring myself to stop getting the same things all the time, maybe one day I'll try the pasta or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Hits the spot on sooo many levels. Soup and Sandwich, what else could you ask for!!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I said to myself, \"I would never, ever, drink veggie-blended soup!\" But my life changed when I took a sip of their butternut squash soup that my mom ordered *insert heavenly music*

It. Was. AMAZING. I couldn't believe it was butternut squash. Actually, I still don't believe it. How is it possible that a veggie-blended soup could taste soooo good?

Don't let the word \"butternut\" scare you! Just give it a try~"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten yet as I am about to board a flight, but it looks yummy and the service was super quick and friendly - can't wait to try the food!"}
{"text":"Wildflower is consistent and they are SO good about getting my to go orders ready in such little time!! I usually call when it's crunch time and I need a good quick meal between classes. Their chopped salad is really good!!!"}
{"text":"A shout out to a super young man, Roman.   Thank you for being patient with two old ladies this afternoon.  Great customer service!   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Really good soups.
Great place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time"}
{"text":"Fantastic healthy food! They have some wonderful bread, pastas, and salads. Plus it's really inexpensive for the amount of food you get! They also have a little counter for desserts that I always try to check out. Sometimes they have some neat brownies or cookies over there. The staff is always super friendly and it seems like they really enjoy working there. The menu is really easy to navigate and the stores are always extremely clean no matter how busy they are. I wish they had more of them around, but they're pretty similar to Panera Bread, but Wildflower has better bread than Panera. It's always a great experience every time I go so I definitely couldn't think of anything negative to say. Overall a fantastic lunch or brunch spot!"}
{"text":"You have the best Asian chicken salad by far. The portion size is perfect and I love how thinly you slice the chicken.I leave feeling full and healthy. The spicy meatball sandwich is also and outstanding dish."}
{"text":"Good food, creative sandwich combos (my current fave is the turkey and brie), interesting soups (such as lobster bisque, asparagus, curry), quick service (they bring it to your table) and free wifi!"}
{"text":"wonderful food! so healthy! portions are huge if you order a salad. enough for two people to share. 
A must have...loaf of red, white & blue bread. take some home!"}
{"text":"I travel in and out of airports around the globe, so to dine at an airport terminal diner that was as good as dining gets, - what a pleasant surprise.
The options are varied, organic and fresh and they provide tableside service.
The server Nikaeus M was excellent.
I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOOOOOOOVE this place. The food is really good and reasonably priced. We mostly go here for breakfast and make a special request for chocolate chip banana pancakes which are the best I've had anywhere, and I've done my share of requesting those in many places. The pastries are great, the sandwiches and salads are awesome. You can't go wrong. I brought my parents when they came to visit and they love it too. Friendly staff, free internets and outlets at every seat is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I've been to this Wildflower many times as am very happy with the service and food. It is a chill place to get some decent healthy food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the tomato pesto & Brie sandwich, grilled. It was deliciously unusual. Service was very quick and friendly despite the long line."}
{"text":"I was in this bakery today and just wanted to say how well two of your managers handled and extraordinarily rude and disruptive woman. She came in with a very large dog that had no help vest on. When the manager (female) asked her for the permit for the dog the woman became absolutely irate and started berating her. She then proceeded to pour herself some coffee and realized the dispensers weren't full. A nice young lady replied that she was brewing coffee right now and that she could pour her some. The woman with the dog then proceeded to yell for her money back, saying this is ridiculous and that her manager should learn when to stop talking. 

Round two occurs between the female manager and the irate woman about the dog not having a vest on and the woman demands to talk to the owner/superior who could fire the woman. A male manager then steps out to talk to her and she is by no means any more calm. I would hate to see this manager lose her job for some Scottsdale house wife who couldn't be bothered to leave her dog out side a place where food is sold, especially when state law requires a vest on all help dogs. I've been here many times, the service has always been fantastic. I'm currently writing this review while eating my Turkey Waldorf salad (which is delicious by the way), hoping to do some good for a working woman who was treated so appallingly."}
{"text":"Had the new Haddock sandwich. Very tasty!  Nice addition to the sandwiches and pastas.  The value here is fantastic - no entrees over $9 and amazing bread.  No white tablecloths, but if you're looking for a casual atmosphere and really quality food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  One of my favorite places to eat.  BUT, the service is consistently SLOW!  Only 1 cashier when packed and if they do have a second cashier that person is on the phone taking to-go orders!  The worst is when people get to the front of the line and they don't know what they want and leave the rest of us stuck in line!!  There desparately needs to be a secondary menu board and menus for people while they are waiting.   Been here 25 minutes and still no salad.  Well speak of the devil.  It finally came but not as ordered.  Looks like I'm going to have lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"We love Wildflower Bread Company! Their soups are not only healthy, but taste homemade. The salads are hearty and made with several greens and organic. Kathleen took time to give us help with our order and checked on us while we were eating. Not your typical soup and sandwich place. You must try breakfast too! Thanks Kathleen ."}
{"text":"Had sweet potato & greens breakfast bowl. It was delicious. Frank oversaw our table and was courteous and very helpful. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. We had turkey vegetable rice and broccoli cheddar soup which were wonderful.  My boyfriend loved the half ham and swiss sandwich. I ordered the half chicken salad. The sandwich, although plentiful with cucumber,  bean sprouts and tomatoes, sadly was missing the chicken salad. There was not even a bite full.
Rating it a 4 cause my boyfriend enjoyed his lunch. I rate it a 3.,"}
{"text":"The food here is always very fresh and tastes good. I have not tried their breakfast yet but the sandwiches, salads, soups, and pasta are delicious. The one small thing I don't like is their side that comes in a small sauce container, it really is the smallest side I have ever seen. Not sure if there is a reason for it but it's not a big deal. The food in my opinion is a little pricey but worth it and like I said it is always fresh :)"}
{"text":"If you are from the east coast and miss getting real bread here in the desert, then this place is for you!  Their sandwiches are the very best, all wonderful ingredients.  Fresh, delicious.  And they have awesome pastas, salads and soups to die for too.  The Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich is a favorite.  Get the homemade potato chip mix with your sandwich...yum!  Very busy at lunch - be warned, and a little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill.

My boyfriend and I used to frequently come here for breakfast every weekend over the last four years. However, this place has really gone downhill over the last year or so. Our food used to come out relatively fast (10-15 minutes max). The last few times we've been there, it takes them at least 30 minutes. To top it off, my order of blueberry ricotta pancakes was wrong. They gave me the banana walnut pancakes instead. Told them it was ok and that I would eat them, mostly because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my food. Luckily I'm not allergic to nuts, but this mistake could have been deadly for someone else. Manager came over and gave me a gift card because she felt bad. I'm not sure what has happened to this location, the staff doesn't seem motivated, the manager seems to have no control over the food or her staff. I don't believe we will be going back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Taste like the breakfast they serve at a cheap 3 star hotel.  Bacon is flimsy and hardly taste like bacon. Only decent thing were the home fried potatoes. Even those were sus!  I think this place was bought out a few years back. Use to be half decent. No longer...."}
{"text":"Love the new menu! Can't get enough of the caramelized cauliflower pasta for dinner and the V12 salad with a scoop of quinoa is divine! Really such an affordable option and reliably delicious food. It's our go to place. Also, must say something about the brunch...the new frittata with the mushrooms is outstanding and the pancakes are sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I just love this place for so many reasons...it's yummy, clean, cheerful and has the most amazing staff!  We celebrated a special birthday there recently and Karen (the GM0 actually recognized our guest of honor by her order!  She also took the time from a very busy day to come and say hello.  The food is amazing and as a Vegan i was happy to find several yummy and healthy options.  I totally agree with \"Eat well, be well\" and always appreciate a restaurant that recognizes the responsibility to its diners to serve healthy, tasty and fresh food.  Will be going there as often as possible!  Go Karen and amazing staff:)"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The staff is excellent and the food is delicious and fresh. I love the chicken pistachio pomegranate salad, so yummy! My sister loves the morning glory muffins. This is our go-to lunch spot and we have never had a less than great experience; keep doing what you're doing Wildflower!"}
{"text":"I love that I can walk to Wildflower for a nummy fix of comfort food. I'm a big fan of the butternut squash ravioli, the Carribean Cob salad and the stuffed french toast. 

They have this spectacular counter of delicious looking baked goods. Unfortunately, things tend to dry out. The cupcakes, on the other hand, are always wonderfully decadent. In fact, in October, they sold Cupcakes for the Cure and I definitely supported the cause. 

The Tempe location is really popular with people in the neighborhood, so getting a table requires patience."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Shortly after posting my review, I was quickly contacted by the founder of Wildflower Cafe who expressed his concerns over my unhappy experience.  He asked for more details of my experience and promised us a WOW experience if we chose to dine with them again.  
He refunded my bill and offered a complimentary future meal if we chose to dine again with Wildflower.  I felt that his concerns were genuine and appreciated the goodwill gesture.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy meat-free layover snack at the airport, and I suppose the \"wildflower\" bit drew me in. I vacillated for a while, but the friendly staff assured me \"anything you pick will be great!\" I settled on the tomato, mozzarella, pesto sandwich. They handed over the premade for $8.

I was immediately disappointed by the light weight of the sandwich; for $8 i expected a dinner to satiate me for an overnight flight, rather than a light lunch. I unwrapped it and found the ingredients a thin line between two pieces of bread; the bread to fillings volume ratio was quite poor. The sundried tomatoes were flavorful but the mozzarella was unremarkable, while the lettuce and pesto were fresh and tasty. Ultimately, the sandwich's size and underwhelming ratio netted disappointment. Perhaps I should have gone with the more sizeable veggie salad..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Wildflower with her mother and father. The food was good and the service was excellent. Brandon and Jacob, in particular, we're very helpful and kind. It was clear that the store was in good hands and that we would be taken care of. Thank you Brandon and Jacob for your service and kindness."}
{"text":"The best thing at Wildflower is the Ham and Brie Fritata!!! I love that they change a few things on the menu frequently but the staples stay. They also have fantastic salads. If I order a salad I typically get the pomegranate chicken but my boss gets nothing but the Caesar every time he goes.

I only have two complaints. One is the bread they serve with whatever I order is always a really hard crust bread that you need a chainsaw to eat. A friend told me you can request another type of bread but I never remember. So the bread I have been served I don't like. 

My second complaint is their wi-fi policy (or lack of). Wildflower really fills up at lunch and when I go there are always multiple people camped out with their laptops just sipping a drink. A few times I have seen them at tables for 2, but mostly they take the very desirable booths. Wildflower needs to change how friendly they are to \"wi-fi campers\"."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I had the berry French toast and turkey sausage. Friendly and clean. A bit pricy. I also bought a loaf of Rye bread which was amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the food-- I love the Chopped Salad and ALL of the soups are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is good, like how they have electrical plugs at most of the seating areas. Always friendly staff. Love the pesto pasta"}
{"text":"Love the ambience. Great place for a sandwich or salad while you enjoy the free WiFi. Wildflower has a great selection and very tasty bakery. Much better than paradise bakery. I would suggest you not upcharge for a side with your sandwich and have a choice of sides. Since you charge about 9 dollars for a sandwich why upcharge for chips or a small house salad , pasta? Still, I love the food."}
{"text":"Bruno made an amazing 3 cheese ravioli with meatballs.
Great customer service up front as well. Great food before getting on my plane"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, sandwiches and salads. The triple club is amazing with the strawberry salad.  Generous portions and best of all friendly service."}
{"text":"I am a regular here for breakfast. It is consistently excellent. Cassandra always makes me feel welcome and like family. She and this place are Gems."}
{"text":"Always friendly. I have never eaten anything bad here. Everything so delicious! Clean place with prompt service! Try the fruit and nut bars and the wildflower salad with chicken."}
{"text":"I love their selection of salads even more so then Paradise Bakery which I am also a big fan of, and I loved their sweet potato sandwich! I also enjoy that they have pasta dishes to choose from. I am a huge fan of both Wildflower and Paradise Bakery for Fast Foods."}
{"text":"always love this place.  been to several locations, all are great!.  big fan of the breakfast ham and brie frittata, the potatoes are great.  
love the blt, i mean avocado, bacon, and cheddar....  (and i guess the lettuce and tomato)....c'mon that's awesome.  
and now the potato cream cheese soup.  as a side to the blt.  or by itself in a huge bread bowl.  whew!  i'm full thinking about it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place ~ IF I had to only choose one resturant to order from this one might be my top choice.  It's so clean, with healthy food and good, fast, friendly service.  They have the BEST salads!  

One of my farovite personal treats is to ride my bike to Wildflower Bread Company and have their delicious coffee and a Bearclaw pastry. (Yeah, I know it sounds anti-productive to ride a bike to eat a pastry ~ but it's better than driving to eat pastry!)  

They have a very nice outside eating area, too.  I often go here by myself just to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather, nice people and great food.  I always feel blessed when I leave.  They seemed blessed as well ~ they always seem to have a full house.  Blessings to them.  : ) KC"}
{"text":"Been going to the Tempe location of Wildflower Bread Company for years and I have NEVER been disappointed ~ great food, clean facility, plus the Tempe location is adjacant to Changing Hands Bookstore, an amazing bookstore.  IF there is ever a time I am even a little blue I go to the Tempe Wildflower Bread Company ~ Eat, Read, and then go home and Pray.  It doesn't get better than that.  Blessings to them for being such a uplifting place.  Blessings : ) KC"}
{"text":"Seldom do I take the time to write a review while sitting in the restaurant,  but today, Wildflower Bread Company at Chandler Mall deserves it. Three different male employees assisted me.  The first guy greeted me and took my order.  A different person rushed ahead of me to wipe a table where a single individual had just sat. There was no dish or trash left on the table.  It looked clean. But he insisted, saying, \"Please let me do this for you; it's no trouble\". The third person brought my food and later cleared my dishes. All three individuals were smiling, polite, distinctly courteous and we'll spoken. Not once did I hear \"no problem\" or get the feeling they wanted to be elsewhere. These days, that kind of encounter at a quick lunch place is commendable. The food was delicious as well. It lends credibility to these employee's genuine work ethic when I mention I am not a 21 year old cutie. I'm 61."}
{"text":"There's really nothing negative I can say about this location. If you're stuck on where to eat out this place will never disappoint. I come here quite often and I have to say, you can't go wrong with any of the pastas really. The three cheese ravioli and the rosemary linguini pastas are two of my favorites and come with two pieces of garlic bread. Who doesn't like garlic bread? They're delicious and very reasonably priced. 

The whole staff is extremely friendly providing excellent service and food every time. Destiny is one of the friendliest cashiers i've ever had the pleasure of meeting and provides great recommendations, especially on desserts. 

The manager is also a very friendly guy who takes pride in his job and cares about the customer. 

I will definitely continue coming here for as long as I live in the area! :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service every employee working the register looked miserable! We had to ask after we  were cut off waiting in line by the employee taking the other persons order if all the registers were closed and if someone could take our order! Three guy employees were to busy talking to two of theirs friends while on the clock and the girl with blue hair seemed as if she wasn't getting paid to take our order! Will NOT be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and staff! The food came out within 7 minutes and it was delicious!! I will most definitely be coming back I'm so glad I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"Love their soup collection! Love the salad with the lavender in it!!!! Their lemonade is always delicious! And the deserts are great! Especially the tart toffee tart! And all the breads I have tasted are delicious!!!! Even my kids love the soup!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service, despite a considerable lunch rush (Sunday, 11:30am).  BLT+ sandwich was fresh and crisp, the bread bowl of onion soup was delicious, althogh not quite full.  All in all, a good lunch."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great variety of unique stuff - from the frittatas to the soups and pastas. I always love to grab a slice of carrotcake to enjoy at home later. Portions are about average, not too big or too small for the average appetite.

Cons: Seating an lines. For both the Chandler and Tempe locations it can be a bit of a gamble going there to eat at peak dining times because it's popular and crowded. Worth the wait if you have the time -- if it weren't for this small issue, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for a fresh, crisp BLT sandy at lunch, any day of the week!  

Av was a spread, tho...or it gets that coveted 5th star!

Great part about this business is it's locally owned.  Yep, that's right.  I know the owners, well, I know who they are, and they invest back into the community.  

So, I eat at this joint regularly not just for the great food and service.  

Flagstaff and North Scottsdale locations are go-to's."}
{"text":"The Manager here is a diamond.  Very attentive, friendly and customer focus.  Food is good but the atmosphere is wonderful with smiles and laughter.  Thank you for making what would have been a bad morning good..."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The staff is all super friendly even when it's chaotic in there!!! Favorite lunch break spot to go to :)"}
{"text":"It's good but not memorable.  I usually go because it's convenient."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious soup and sandwich here at WFBC.   The order delivered to our table was a little different than our order, but Cody quickly fixed the order for us.   He was very personable and friendly.  Cody also helped several other customers during our visit with small details to be sure everyone was satisfied and enjoyed their visit.   Nice work.  Cheers !"}
{"text":"My family and I have only been twice but both times the food was great and so was the customer service! Will be going back for more mushroom soup :)"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this location.  I used to meet at another local bakery, but the coffee there was terrible and the lighting not so good.  At Wildflower there is a quality menu and bright atmosphere which make this my go to spot for breakfast and lunch meetings. Thanks Wildflower!
Check out: 
the coffee - great!
Black berry lemonade - Awesome!
cranberry scone
Emerald Spinach salad - I add mushrooms.
Vegetarian Spicy Red Pepper soup - excellent!!!
Seasonal quality baked items makes every new visit interesting:)"}
{"text":"Parking at this location is terrible because it gets incredibly jammed and it's a little chaotic ordering/getting food but if you can look past those, you will be rewarded with delicious fresh food.

Whenever I'm in the mood for soup and sandwich or just a sandwich that isn't a deli standard, this is my go to spot.  The Wildflower grilled cheese is absolutely delicious, it alone gets me in the door.  The sweet potato sandwich is also fantastic.  Their soups are always excellent and they have at least two vegetarian soups to choose from (you hear that other similar concept chain).  The breads are top notch and their pastries are good.  They make a decent latte too.

If you're looking for a bread/bakery/soup/sandwich type place with nice iced tea and coffee drinks - this one beats the other one in my opinion."}
{"text":"Please bring back the potato salad! (update: It's Back!! YAY and thank you!!)
I love how late this place is open, it's the perfect place to grab something quick and healthy after a late night workout... Or if you're being bad, something sweet as well!"}
{"text":"Love Wildflower Bread Co always consistent!! I got the Roast Beef/Gorgonzola sandwich which I love!! Never a disappointment!! Will return! I try to visit Wildflower often as my wife loves their desserts.."}
{"text":"I've had a few breakfast meetings here, and really like the location (although not really on Scottsdale Rd, it's on Indian Bend across from the Railroad Park, but easy to find with plenty of parking). Plenty of electrical outlets and wifi make it a good place to work and nibble on the free bread samples and get coffee'd up while waiting. I've been unable to tear myself away from the feta and tomato eggs, I love the way the flavors play off each other. And the bread is great, tastes like someone actually baked it. And there's always more coffee... With Jacqueline's gone, it's my go-to breakfast meeting location in this part of town (or Coffee Roastery...)"}
{"text":"Great service today, thank you Jenna for taking such good care of us. Service was fast thus morning and the food  (especially for the price) was outstanding. We always have left overs!"}
{"text":"I agree with the first comment. While this place has some pretty good options for food, it has come out bad a couple times. For example, last time I went I got the harvest apple pork sandwich, and the bread was toasted to such a sharp crisp that it would cut the roof of my mouth and gums. The pork smelled a little bit haggard as well. The best things on the menu are the oriental chicken salad and the spinach lasagna dish. I wouldn't recommend the coffee, but it isnt bad. 
For breakfast, this place is terrible. I ran late to class because the service took forever, and there were only like 3 people in the restaurant. I got some egg fritter thing that was pretty bad as well. slightly cold and looked like a collage of breakfast items. 

As for the crowd, like the first commenter said, they dont take kindly to the hungover or the grimey looking customer. I rolled in with moccasins, basketball shorts and a greasy face/head after a night of heavy drinking and got a few stares like I was a vagrant."}
{"text":"I love their grown up version of a grilled cheese sandwich.  Any sandwich would probably be delicious since they make wonderful bread.  It's a good place to go with the kids,  Everyone gets something they will like in a relaxed, casual environment."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by to get some soup and bread boules on our way home.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a enthusiast young lady named Stephanie.  She offered us samples of a great new pumpkin pie and cheese cake they offered.  My personal favorites.  From there Stephanie helped us choose a good soup by offering more samples for us to try.  We picked out an excellent creamy garlic soup and after trying the pumpkin pie we definitely took a slice to go as well.  Stephanie was just amazing!  She was so happy, vibrant and a pleasure to be around.  She took a genuine interest in us and made us feel welcomed and at home.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating here.  A diverse enough menu to please many.  I had the Wildflower Salad - it was fresh and tasty.  A very nice ambiance with outdoor seating and close to Trader Joe's if you need to pick up some groceries.  It is nice to have this local establishment close by."}
{"text":"I am a longtime fan of Wildflower, particularly this location.  I no longer live in that area but I'm quite the yelper these days so I'm catching up on the kudos.  

The food here is wonderful.  The salads are amazingly refreshing, cleverly crafted, and the portions are generous.  Their selection of soups in the chilly weather are the very definition of comfort food.  The breads are amazing as well, though not the main attraction in spite of \"bread\" being part of their name.  The desserts range from tasty to decadent.  I also appreciate the customer service here and the fact that they do indeed bring the food to your table even when the place is jam packed wall to wall.   

There is but one cautionary note for this location - the parking.  It is so not the fault of the establishment, but take note...park a little further away and walk versus parking right in front of the door because you will never get out.  It may sound petty, but the parking situation can sometimes be a dealbreaker for me.  I can't be alone on this or else it wouldn't be mentioned in the primary description for any place listed here on Yelp.  

Aside from that, this and any other Wildflower Bread Co. location is definitely worth a visit for something different.  Don't leave without a chocolate pumpkin muffin if they have them!  To die for..."}
{"text":"We just got back from another visit to this location. I'm happy to report we did NOT experience any of the previous issues this time. The Breadhead behind the register seemed well-versed in where to find things on that contraption. He was quick, polite, read the order back to us, and got us moving on nicely. The order was a bit slow coming out, but I'll attribute this to growing pains. I know we'll showing up there often and I'm sure they'll be up to 5 stars in no time.

Incidentally, I received a message from the owner to my previous post expressing his concern over our first few experiences and offered to refund ALL of our money spent there so far. Although that gesture was very much appreciated, it was not necessary. It's just nice to know that the \"higher-ups\" actually see these things and care about their content. Quite refreshing."}
{"text":"I must say the customer service was unexpected!! Some of the friendliest people I have had the pleasure of encountering, especially at a fast service bakery. The brioche bun on my ham and Swiss was amazingly light, and my iced vanilla latte was delicious. I am in town for work and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great egg white, roasted tomato and feta sandwich and coffee!  Best part was the friendly service --they went above and beyond.  Free coffee refills and nice relaxing music.  Very clean and will be back, definitely!"}
{"text":"They have a friendly staff but the food isn't anything to rave about. I ordered the grilled cheese. The cheese had no distinct flavor it tasted like mushy nothingness."}
{"text":"Very unhappy customer. 9mths ago I ordered a Tuna Sandwich to go and was very disappointed. It had less then tablespoon of Tuna on it; you could not taste the Tuna. I called and complained and was told it was a mistake and they were sorry. Thought I would give them another try so I returned on Saturday March 12, 2011 ordered a Tuna to go again it had less then tablespoon of Tuna on it. This is an $8 sandwich including tax. I want more Tuna for my hard earn dollar.  Think twice before spending you're hard earn money at Wildflower, Try Paradise Bakery at Norterra just off of I17 and Happy Valley RD. Paradise Bakery has the best sandwiches and the Tuna, Turkey, Ham, Salads and Soups are GREAT....."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! Wether you are dining in or taking out the food is always made to perfection! What I love about Wildflower, not only is the food great but the service is equal in quality! Zoey in particular made the entire experience memorable! Not only did she take great care of me, she filled the place with positive energy! Such an amazing staff accompanied by an amazing menu!"}
{"text":"This is a really well managed location.  Our party had a small issue with ordering, and the woman who came over to help was very attentive & helpful!    I have been wanting to try them for catering since apparently the minimum is not too expensive."}
{"text":"So last night we stopped in wildflower to place an order for two dozen assorted bagels and a few spreads for the next morning. They helped us pick out the bagels to get and were very accommodating. 

Flash forward to this morning, we were in a hurry and the manager had no record of our order. I was a little miffed, and it could have turned into a bad experience. Instead, the manager gave my husband and myself free drinks, got our order together in five minutes, gave us a (delicious!) free scone and we were on our merry way. A mistake turned into a positive experience. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite for breakfast. The banana walnut pancakes, sausage and egg sandwich, frittatas, oatmeal are all great. Love the house blend and passion tea. Nice atmosphere. And there have been times we've carried our. They package the meals very nicely."}
{"text":"Breakfast at this place is awesome, great food, prices, and customer service unlike no other.  Once had an issue with some bread, they refunded my bread, and gave me a 10.00 gift card for the trouble.  

They also respond very well to feedback on Twitter, @wildflowerbread

One of the best dishes they have is the chicken caesar salad!  To die for on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Wildflower is a lunchtime staple for us since it's right across the street from work. The sandwiches are a good size, made with ingredients and bread that tastes fresh. Their salads are large with plenty of toppings, so you're not just eating greens. There's a good variety to choose from, so we never get bored of eating the same item over and over again. They need to work on staffing during the lunch hour, as there is often only one person working the register when the lunch rush hits. The line usually begins going out the door prior to one of their workers finally hopping on another register. We often make a conscious decision not to visit Wildflower if we can't head out for lunch before 11:30. We know the line will be too long for us to get food in a timely fashion. When we do make it there, though, we enjoy the food knowing it's a fresher and healthier option than some other restaurants we could visit."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town.  The frittata was very good.  Fresh fruit was ok.  We were there at 8:00 AM and the place was very dirty.  It did not look like the restaurant was cleaned last night.  Actually, the corners and bathrooms did not look like they had been properly in a long time.  The staff was not very friendly and I was served a dirty plate.  When I took it up to be placed, the staff had to look through many plates for a clean one.  I will not return even though I go through the area often."}
{"text":"I wasn't very happy when my family chose to eat here, but I had to go along with it to be with the group.  I was afraid there wouldn't be anything gluten free.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the v12 kale salad.  it was huge and delicious.  There were also gluten free soups.  My two year old granddaughter enjoyed the vegetable soup and the peach smoothie.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and the prices weren't bad.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are incredibly friendly and willing to go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. 
I had many questions about ingredients in different dishes, and the cashier answered all of them with patience and a smile. She even went back to the kitchen to find out information she was unsure about. 
It's easy to feel like a burden to food service folks when you have particular dietary needs. 
Wildflower Bread Co. knows how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's first experience dining at Wildflower Bread Company. I speak for both of us by saying this was a delightful experience! First Kudos go to the staff under the professional and approachable Manager Adrienn. We were met with smiling faces of cheer who assisted us by answering our inquiries in regard to the inviting Menu.. I preface this by the unexpected agenda we were under after our Airlines had a one hour delay in boarding/takeoff due to a safety issue. This interfered with us making our connecting flight to our eventual destination for my boyfriends Corporate Convention in Minneapolis. One can imagine the state of stress this ushered into our unexpected venture. We selected Wildflower Bread CO. due to the initial ambiance followed by an equally impressive choice of healthy menu items. The highlight before the food arriving was the friendliness of the cashier who was a becon of light that never stopped. High praises to this well managed crew of flowers. Isavel who delivered our Turkey Sandwiches with delicious soups to boot. She followed through with a continued warmth and customer service supreme. Britner R. , Brittany M and the energetic cooking staff who prepared a delicious menagerie of taste. It engaged all our senses and initiated a better tone to our day. Many thanks!!"}
{"text":"I decided to visit Wild Flower because I've been a little sick and I was in the mood for some delicious home made soup in a bread bowl. When I arrived, they had a soup I had never tried before 'Thai Chicken and Rice' that sounded interesting. I asked the girl at the counter if she liked it and she said yes offered me a free sample. Once I tried the sample I was sold! It was the right amount of spicy and flavor. The staff was so friendly and checked in on me to make sure everything was tasting okay. I will definitely be back. Thank you for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is similar to Panera Bread. They both serve soup salads and sandwiches.  The difference is definitely the taste. In my opinion Wildflower Bread Co. surpasses Panera. Their lemon ricotta pancakes were light and hinted of lemon. They serve it with maple syrup and a raspberry sauce."}
{"text":"New fave at PHX. Really delicious sandwich (I had the Super BLT, which adds turkey and avocado), and it came out within a couple minutes of ordering. Ingredients were fresh and crisp - not the usual airport nonsense. 

Friendly service, super efficient, sandwich hit the spot. A+, would eat again."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving them a mediocre rating but I'm reviewing what's in their NAME. I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert (that is quite a chore) because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread. 

I had Boar's Head roast beef, tomatoes, horseradish sauce, avocado, roasted red peppers etc I just needed great bread. Where else in Gilbert should I go? I did a Yelp search and it agreed - to this place. 

I arrived around 4:15 and the pickings were slim. I got the last round of sourdough and a small nine grain. I asked her to slice thick, she walked to the slicer and said it has one setting. Okay I'll slice myself. 

Because I love Cupcakes I also took a chocolate cupcake and my boys got a chewy brownie each. The total was about $16. 

We got home the bread was hard (both) soft on the deep inside so I had to grill the sandwiches with butter not my plan but it's butter, butter fixes everything. 

The cupcake frosting was good I ate the top threw away the 'cup' not worth the calories. I only allowed the boys to eat half the brownie each and save the other half for tomorrow as they were huge. The said they were really good. 

Basically, I'll buy my bread at the grocery store or at Paradise bakery as the wasted gas and time in the car was not worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is clean, service is fast, the menu is vast, and the food is fresh! The management staff is extremely friendly and it is obvious they want each customer to have an amazing experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Jacob was so sweet as I came in 10 minutes before closing. I complimented him on his BAKED shirt. He laughed. I asked what soup he recommended. He said potato cream cheese. It was great! I asked whether he liked the toffee pie. He said he likes it but, his favorite was the ginger cheesecake which I took a piece of home. Kelsie made sure I had hot coffee which I SO appreciated! Brandon practically was whistling while he worked! He's so friendly. We shared Fam-Damn-ly stories. 
I love this local friendly place! It's a non-bar \"Cheers\" where Everbody knows your name!"}
{"text":"Just had a Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich for lunch there.  Hot Damn, that was some fine eating!

I think I'll come back again, and again, and again.  BTW - breakfast is now served until 2:00pm on the weekends (10:30am during the week)  
They open at 6:00am M-F and 7:00am on the weekends

Parking is very tight for the lunchtime crowd, so try to be there NLT that 11:40am or you may not get a spot since there's more restaurants in that plaza than places to park! If you're just popping in to pick up a to-go order, this won't be an issue since they have the some to-go parking in front of the door."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service highly recommend this location! \"Walker\" the manager was very personable and friendly. Definitely will return to this location."}
{"text":"Loved coming here for breakfast. Their sweet potatoes, veggies, and eggs plate was the best part of my morning."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at Wildflower but today their morning team really made me a believer in good values and great people. It was a mad house today and their shift manager, Jennifer, jumped in and rolled up her sleeves (literally) and encouraged her people to pace themselves and pull through the rush. She was courteous to patrons asking questions while she was running the kitchen and she kept a cool head for everyone. Great show of endurance under pressure...this location wins for today!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. We always order the same salads and they are always done right. They even know me by name. Talk about personalized service. Wish that there was more parking spaces though."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Wildflower Bread Company I have never had anything that I didn't like here but, my most recent experience had me feeling as though I wasted $10.  

My daughter ordered the Chicken Continental sandwich and the description states it has honey mustard on it - turns out, it is DIJON honey mustard, something neither one of us can stand.  I think the menu needs to make that clear - either you like dijon, or you don't.

Aside from that - I'm only sorry they don't have one in Oregon.  I'm relocating soon and will miss their Chopped Salad with chicken greatly!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and the so is the service.  Potato soup is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Wildflower, today! As I was walking in one of the employees was loading their truck and had a cart to haul himself, but stopped to hold the door open for me. I was impressed at this courtesy and said thank you! Walked in & the salad I had ordered by phone was ready to go. Picked it up, and got my drink, then headed back out. The same employee, a young African American man who had been running errands back and forth to the truck & was a bit tired from the work & summer heat, saw me coming out with my hands full and held the door for me once more. Courtesy and thoughtfulness at its best! From start to visit, this place has very friendly staff.  Food is always delicious & fresh, too!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a little salad and turns out it was so good I could not stop eating it, but that's not why I gave it a 5.  The employees here are genuinely happy and the service was superb!  Yes, in an airport!   They made the experience exceptional and that was worth more than words can say."}
{"text":"oh jeez, how couldn't you like it? The only thing against it is that when it's crowded, it can get unbearable. 

A) It's friggin' cheap. I gave it one dollar sign but really it sits nicely at about one and a half. BUT, for that extra half a dollar sign you go from Taco Bell to my girlfriend's nana's mexican food, metaphorically speaking because there aren't really any tacos here. I hate this cliche, but you get plenty bang for your buck. 

B) Not only is it cheap! Not only are the portions descent, oh no, my friends! It's actually tasty too! Step right up and let me shove some sweet pimped out BLT in your mouth for you. Of course there's nice, crispy bacon, cold ripe tomato's and refreshing, crunchy greens laid upon the savory twelve grain bread (delicious!). Tambien, there's a nice pesto sauce that does a more than ok job at replacing the mayo usually dripping from my BLT, and thick slices of a kind of sharp cheddar cheese that get's the job done without making it taste like one big chunk of cheese. YUMMIE!

C) There are so many INTERESTING people, from ditzy ASU girls to Biz-Casual-Boat-Shoes-Wearin-Old-Crankies that are getting pissed because they can't figure out why the table that people just left from is still dirty. So now they're going to snap their fingers at the poor bus boy to clean up what has now become their rightful spot in the resteraunt because THEY'VE been waitning in line and THEY saw it first so anyone who has anything to say can listen to them be as passive aggresive as possible. Then they get all snooty and I have something to make fun of for a while longer, it's awesome. I feel bad for the bus boy and the other employees that have to deal with all the crap, so leave a tip in the tip jar up front for god's sake!

D) I could eat the pancakes every day of my life, but I get fat and broke so I don't."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the ciabatta bread was too hard to eat, but the employees were very pleasant."}
{"text":"My mom and I went in to enjoy a light dinner. I am recovering from stomach surgery and have a hard time with a lot of foods and try to put only high quality in since I am eating very little. I ordered a soup and it was okay but too salty for me. The manager walked by and I asked for a to go container. He asked if I had a problem with the soup. I told him it was a little too salty. He offered their bring me a different soup and accepted. I was thrilled with the customer service. I honestly get most of my calories from tube feeding and was thrilled to have their wonderful potato soup.
 
I went to thank the manager for his wonderful service and told him that is why they are one of my all time favorite places and that because of the service I was going to buy bakery goods to take to the pharmacy people that were filling my perscriptions. While I was ordering another manager came over and comped me the bakery goods because they said I was so kind and that I made their day. I want to say thank you to the entire staff, you are a wonderful team. You put out a quality product and offer customer service that is amazing.  

You made my night and I will be a loyal customer forever.

{"text":"Always good food.   Our order was mistakenly picked up by another customer and they fixed it fast.   Explained what happened and made the order again super fast.   Great service :-)"}
{"text":"Best customer service and nicest people ever! My sandwich took unexpectedly long and was given freebies for the wait. A+"}
{"text":"Panera is great at what it does. But, if you want to step it up to the next level, Wildflower is it. Great salads and sandwiches no matter which one you choose. The staff flows seamlessly from counter, to kitchen to table."}
{"text":"Always great salads and sandwiches are miles ahead of chains like Panera"}
{"text":"I have had one breakfast and now the pasta with lemon and chicken - excellent. Their bread is fresh baked all day - it's great to be able to get off work and get fresh bread. I was surprised about the quality of pasta. Better than Olive Garden - even better than Carraba's . Very clean and lots of staff on at all times. Their carrot cake is crazy good"}
{"text":"I eat at this place 1-3 times every week and am not close to being tired of it.  There are so many things that I LOVE about Wildflower.  Delicious iced tea, banana walnut pancakes, pastries to die for, toffee cake, lovely caesar salad that is very non-boring for a caesar, shortbread cookies Scotland would be proud of and bloody awesome pesto pasta (all their pasta is great)."}
{"text":"Frank was so friendly making my dinner with an old friend such an enjoyable experience. Plus the food was great. I highly recommend Wildflower. Nancy R"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but now, it's just average. The bread is great, don't get me wrong, but I find that the prices and quality of the rest of the ingredients just don't mesh. As an example, when we last dined here, my husband ordered the smoked salmon omelette. We had to dig through the entire thing to find the one piece of smoked salmon in it. The breakfast potatoes tend to be mealy and served luke warm instead of hot and the herbs on them are lacking. I need me some more sea salt and rosemary!

The sandwiches are a good size, it's true and could easily be shared for a light lunch but I just feel like the quality of this place is not as good as it once was now that it's a super busy family place. I will still eat here when I hit the mall but I won't go out of my way to visit this place. I do like their turkey breast and brie sandwich but I wish the mustard was a little heartier. I love stoneground mustards, though, and I suppose I could ask for extra. This place is busy, busy so arrive with a buddy and have them scope out a table while you order."}
{"text":"Great cranberry raisin bagels here! And the soups are really good too, especially the Chicken Lemon Vegetable!"}
{"text":"Have always loved Wildflower.  Good service and super yummy food, whether you eat in or take out.  BUT, AM EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED that they no longer serve their Tomato Bread Salad.  WHY Wildflower, WHY?  Last visit, three days ago, we got Chicken Wild Rice Soup...hubby loved it.  I got a loaf of Rosemary Sea Salt Bread and a slice of Double Chocolate Cake.  Yum!  My reason for only 4 stars, seriously,  is because  the no longer Ave my favorite Bread Salad."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower. There are plenty of delicious options for everyone... The grilled cheese & tomato soup are always a fallback when looking for comfort! The salads are delicious too & they have quite a few options too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had breakfast at wildflower over the last few years probably 100 times.  The breakfast are very good with the exception of the breakfast potatoes.   I've complained about the breakfast potatoes being lukewarm or room temperature probably 20 different times maybe more.  When I complained they take them away and bring them back hot or if when I order them I asked them to be sure they're hot when I order they're OK otherwise they are almost always room temperature.  I would give this restaurant five stars if after all of my complaining they could figure out how to be sure and serve hot fresh breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"You can always count on good food here.  Their tea is to die for!  I have a few favorites here at this establishment.  The Turkey Cranberry Sandwich is always my favorite, but it is seasonal, and the Butternut Squash is always the best.  When I am not feeling good The Potato Soup in a bread bowl is where I turn to."}
{"text":"Wildflower is my favorite restaurant and I eat there often. The food is great and the employees are wonderful. Kyle is a long time favorite and Gavin is a new favorite - cheerful and efficient - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"They have it all: salads, soups, sandwiches, coffee. All fresh, high quality and decently priced. Your only problem may be finding a seat."}
{"text":"Very happy for the personal service from the wonderful crew at DV Wildflower!
The food is always Great and the service even better!!! Want to thank (might misspell) all the crew Lexia, Madison, Megan, Brandon. Cacy and of course the cooks and so many more and cannot name all of them - thankful for not just good service but Genuine Service with a heart!"}
{"text":"Just had the most AMAZING Emerald Spinach Salad at Wildflower Bread Company! Always have superb personalized service along with Amazing food!  Thanks to the chef - Delgado and Natalie for the Great Food and GreAt service!"}
{"text":"Puts a whole new standard to \"airport food.\" Breakfast sandwich,  \"Ultimate Bacon.\" Delicious, with a soft, warm brioche bun that makes me sad to know I'll never have it again. Perhaps they could add a little more pesto and a little less arugula, but all in all, a great way to fill up  for breakfast. On top of that - great music and power outlets! And most importantly: The long line snaking out into the airport floor didn't take much time at all. Ordered within 5 min. Received food within another 5. Perfect."}
{"text":"Fun food truck, but I thought their pizza was just ok. They scrimp a bit on the sauce and toppings, and I wish they had more options. Not bad, just not amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all the Wildflower Bread Companies, and this one hits the same expectations.  My favorite sandwich is the Sweet Potato Sandwich... it sounds kinda odd, but it is delicious.  Roasted sweet potato with mozzarella, figs, arugula and Balsamic Vinaigrette... so good.  Pair a half of one with a cup of soup or small salad for a perfect lunch.

This location gets incredibly busy over the lunch hour, so get there early or be prepared to rush the last open table.  Even as busy as they were, service was very good for this kind of partial-service establishment.  There was someone to clear dishes, bring butter, bring a takeout box, etc, as needed.  

The bathroom seems disproportionately nice compared to the restaurant, which is not a complaint.  I like that there are real doors on the stalls!"}
{"text":"After hearing everyone speak so highly of Wildflower on a recent trip to Scottsdale, I was excited to give this place a go. A group of six of us dined here for a quick breakfast before heading to a meeting.

I ordered a Wildflower Cappuccino and the two-egg breakfast. The cappuccino was not memorable and the food was decent, nothing that myself or any of my dining companions felt was extraordinary. I would love to give this place another go, perhaps try their lunch selection in hopes of more variety and creativity in their food offering.

The pros were the service was very quick and our group was able to secure a large table in a semi-cornered area for business talk before our meeting. We definitely appreciated the privacy and the great service is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Salads seem a bit pricey for what's really on them, breakfast sandwiches are great, and customer service is fine.. Sometimes I feel like their going through the motions and I wish that for a locally owned business they would try to connect with their customers more as most are regulars."}
{"text":"Very busy and hard to find a seat. Maybe it's because Saturday morning. The food took much longer than usual. It's OK for quick breakfast. Food was still good tho."}
{"text":"Needed a healthy place to eat at the airport, which is a rare find. Although the Employee who I encountered was rude when I ordered, the food was pretty good. It's a small place with limited amount of tables.

I got the Vegetable Quinoa Salad and it was pretty good, but not as fresh as I wanted it to be. The dressing has a nice lime flavor to it which makes it taste better. They give you one thick slice of sourdough bread with it, which was pretty good too."}
{"text":"hi just wanna take a minute to compliment ivan a waiter here at wildflower always greets me and has a smile is very kind and on top of things makes me realize how a smile and a have a good day can make someone feel so good thank you ivan"}
{"text":"Great experience today at Wildflower! We actually had lunch at Wildflower in Sedona, then again here in Phoenix for dinner. My dad had the V12 salad, twice, and I had the roasted sweet potato sandwich with the Wildflower salad and for dinner I had the three cheese ravioli with the Caesar salad. Everything was delicious, only thing I didn't like was the lavender in the Wildflower salad was pretty bitter. Our server Brandon at this location was especially notable for going above and beyond to make our dinner perfect. We are from San Diego and Yuma and wish there was a Wildflower closer to us!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after some fun apartment hunting. It was cloudy, hot, and I was feeling horrible from a bad cold. I figured a little bit of comfort food would make me feel better, and even with the hot weather, I wanted some soup! My fiance and I shared a spicy cuban sandwich and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. Both were super good, and I felt much much better. Although I loved our meal, I think the 5 star rating is thanks to the cranberry oatmeal cookie. O-M-G it was the most moist, most delicious cookie I have ever had. WOW sooo soft mmmm.. and the cranberries reminded me of thanksgiving. Get that cookie, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times since my last review. All of the salads here are consistently excellent, so I must increase my rating!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale on business!  Love this place.  Great quality sandwiches, soups and salads.  Friendly service and quick on the food delivery.  I'll be back a few more times before I leave!  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm leaning more toward 3.5 starts, like \"I'm a fan... it was A-OK!\"  I've been here a couple of times, and it's pretty good.  The food is good, but it's a bit pricey for a cafeteria style restaurant like this.  The last time I was there I had a sweet potato sandwich that I literally dreamed about the night after... it was awesome.  

During a particularly busy morning, we thought we were going to have to change our order to to-go due to a lack of clear tables.  One of the \"runners\" (a fellow who was delivering food to its respective table and collecting the table stands) noticed our dilemma and helped us secure a table that was just emptying.  In his haste, and probably out of habit, he took the table stand that was supposed to match up with our meal.  No harm, no foul, we flagged him down and he found our orphaned food and delivered it right away.  Friendly all around."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place has the best soup. I've ordered several of them and they are all so good. The prices are reasonable and they have great healthy options. And they put lavender in their salads which is suprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Friendliest place in the airport.  The kids and I stopped in while waiting to pick up their aunt.  I had the best Spicy Cuban I have ever had.  The kids had raviolis and meatballs that were equally as good!  The staff was so friendly and attentive!  Do stop in when at Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Borderline terrible. I had their veggie breakfast frittata and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was returned twice, then I gave up realizing that this place didn't have a clue what they were doing.  The frittata was edible, but looked like snorting you would get from a hospital cafeteria.  The home fried potatoes were gross.  Worse than anything you would buy from the frozen isle at a truck stop.  

Completely not worth ever going back."}
{"text":"Being an avid carb lover, it's safe to say that if it has \"bread\" in the name, chances are I LOVE it!

Their tomato bread salad should win an award.  Granted, I had never heard of such a thing before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but damn!   It is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Not as noisy or crowded today! Both hot coffee choices were decent. Wildflower grilled cheese was great, but make sure you ask for it on sour dough bread!"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and now my new favorite breakfast place.   Clean, casual and comfortable ambiance, friendly staff, terrific coffee and excellent food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First and best was that they allow pets on the patio. My dog joined me for lunch after a grueling hour at the dog park. This in itself gets solid marks. As far as decor I spent my time outside and loved it. It was shaded, clean and their staff checked on us several times even bringing water to my dog. Food wise it was right on up there. I had a half sandwich and petite salad which was very filling. The Caesar dressing was obviously home made and they added mushrooms which was a nice touch. The chicken pesto sandwich was excellent but my bread was a tad crispier than I like. All in all a great spot and we will definitely be back, dog included."}
{"text":"Franco is excellent server. He was the awesome by doing the following: quick/friendly/extremely pleasant and He also provided me with excellent food.I will go to this restaurant always with employees like him. Very happy loyal customer since 2005 Excellent"}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Carrot cake for breakfast! but that aside, they have fabulous food and I love going there. :)"}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Company is a regular favorite of ours.  We visit about five times a week and have sampled their entire menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Healthful food, served quickly, and clean restaurants despite the volume of business they do especially at mealtimes, and always wonderful breads and pastries.  They periodically make changes to the menu and it seems their new selections are well tested before they are offered.  We've also visited their locations on Indian School Road, in Sedona and at the Seville Shopping Center on Indian Bend Road and found them to be consistently good.  These are obviously well-run restaurants and a visit or more for a casual meal is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try a cranberry scone! They are so delicious. I personally like mine with butter. The food is always fresh and so satisfying. The only part I would change is the consistency of some of the food. I love the chicken salad sandwich, but somedays the mixture has too much mayo, and a tip... ALWAYS order dressing on the side for salads. Otherwise be prepared for soaked veggies."}
{"text":"Just had lunch and the chopped salad with salmon was excellent. Their bread is to die for. D they have a large section of fresh bakd breads and other treats.  My friend had a sandwich and she raved as we'll.  pricing was good."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here is delicious...a little pricey for lunch, but worth it. Its a good idea to split a pasta meal and a salad with a friend; Then you get the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"First time here in a while. I only looked at the menu, and didn't even notice the cases of goodies. After noticing a sign showing pie, I asked where the pie was on the menu. Cashier was nice enough to show me the pie case & point out all the baked goodies in that area. When your order is complete, you get a sign stand to place at your table. Once your order is ready, it is brought right to your table. I asked for some water cups when the order came & cups were brought back filled for us. What a place; it has amazing service & quality food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat, no matter what you order you won't go wrong. Best breads, no room for desert get it to go. Very clean restaurant & patio. The service is the best, everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"I remember when I went to Sedona for the first time in 21 years last May, and my out of state friends and I were wrapping up an insane \"Yo, I just moved to Arizona and somehow think a Phoenix-Arcosanti-Montezuma's Castle-Grand Canyon-Sedona-Phoenix-all-in-one day is completely feasable\" road trip, and we were starvin' like marvin, and we saw Wildflower. We ate there, had some soups, sandwiches, and I thought, \"Wow, Sedona's gotten pretty corporate since I was last here, but at least they have this good indie soup/salad/sandwich place that I'll have to come back and eat at again.\"

Heh.

Little did I know Wildflowers were a chain that permeated the state's landscape, as evidenced by all these Yelp reviews. Since my lazy ass made it to Changing Hands only one time so far in my lifetime, I resigned myself to thinking I wasn't going to eat another WF sandwich for an eon or two.

And lo, one just happens to open up on Indian School. Convenient, I'd say.

Granted, with it and Pita Jungle open, along with Rumbi Island Grill and Pei Wei all in the same strip mall, the parking lot at dinner time can get a little chaotic, but it's still worth it. 

Great sandwiches (which come with complimentary bread/roasted tomato salad on the side), soups and salads. Can't vouch for the pasta or the sweet stuff since I haven't had any yet. I have seen a few folks while away their time with their laptop (free wireless) long after their meal was over. Yet, no pissy-ass waiter hinting at them to leave. That's good to see. 

Communal newspaper reading area in the middle, plenty of booths, mellow crowd (at least the few times I've eaten there). They do get a little out of control with the bean sprouts in their sandwiches, but at least you know the first time so they don't keep doing it over and over again. 

All in all, for a casual soup & sandwich place, I'd say this joint is doing just fine."}
{"text":"They have an excellent salmon Cesar salad. I don't like that their pasta items aren't available until late in the day though and the prices are high for a basic soup salad and sandwich place. The combo deal makes it a little more worth it."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the downsized scones .. I would drive a good distance to get their scones... they are now half the size but NOT half the cost... thank you wildflower for saving me calories and gas no need to make the drive anymore.."}
{"text":"Stopped by Wildflower one weekend morning for breakfast.  Even though the place was insanely crowded, the line moved quickly.  All the people behind the counter were friendly and efficient. 

I ordered a two egg breakfast with a side of bacon and an orange juice.  When it was ready, someone brought the food out to my table.  The food itself was nothing short of amazing.  Crisp, buttery toast, thick bacon, lightly seasoned potatoes and scrambled eggs that were perfect.

The only reason I wouldn't eat here every day is the price.  If I remember correctly my meal came to around $10. 

PROS:
Awesome food
Friendly and fast service

CONS:
Price is a little high

BOTTOM LINE:
I'll definitely be coming back!  This place costs about as much as say, Denny's, but the food and service are better."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is always smiling and helpful. I always look forward to eating at Wildflower Bread Company when I go to the valley."}
{"text":"A regular Sunday breakfast place. Good food, decent service considering most runners are high school kids.  Don't order the fall pumpkin soup - gelatinous goo. They traded me for something else, so thanks."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from California. The cashier at the Chapel of the Holy Cross recommended this place :) Good choice!

I say this place is similar to another cafe called Panera Bread back in my area. My friend and I were so happy with the quality and quantity received from our orders.

I ordered a Pick 2 deal where I got a Chicken Presto Half Sandwich and a Potato soup for about $8.59.

This is about the same price as a Pick 2 deal at Panera. The only difference is how much more food you get. The half sandwich is a lot taller and filling than a measly half sandwich at Panera. And the cup of soup is bigger and more shallow than Panera. Both items contained delicious flavors.  

Satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is lovely inside, very relaxing, and well decorated.  The bussers and delightfully friendly.  I ordered the grilled cheese...it was the best freaking grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  Nicely toasted whole grain bread, brie, swiss, cheddar, arugula, and tomato.  I asked if they could add turkey to it and they pleasantly said \"yes, whatever you'd like!\".   The smokey brie added so much flavor and creamy texture. YUM YUM YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Wildflower has such great food. The food is fast and good for a quick sit down lunch. I usually order the chopped salad with chicken instead of salmon. It is delicious!! I am also a big fan of the forest mushroom soup! I'm not sure if it is seasonal because I recently went back and they had changed the soups. I highly recommend Wildflower for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the kale salad and it was delicious! The grilled vegetables were good and the ingredients seemed really fresh. I'm knocking down the stars because it took over and hour to get through lunch. There was only one employee taking orders and the line was backed up to the door, then it took over 20 minutes to get our food out. While the food was good, the amount of time it took to order, wait for the food, and then eat was unacceptable for lunch."}
{"text":"I came in at 10:45 and ordered soup and sandwich to go. There were only a couple people ahead of me and the dining room wasn't too full. I literally sat and waited 20 minutes while the girls in the kitchen area joked around and looked at their iPhone, especially the young blonde girl and the blonde girl with a managers shirt on. They were having inappropriate conversations about partying and this will be the last time I visit this Wildflower. The girl getting the orders ready and packing them up must have asked the girl for my soup to go at least three times. Maybe she should concentrate on her job and not her phone."}
{"text":"Today was 5 star. Went for brunch and had the Protein bowl with quinoa and sausage topped with 2 sunny side up eggs and yummy bread . It was delicious!! Recommend it highly. The coffee was very good as well. Highly satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and different. I had a salad tonight with roasted veggies and salmon. Their Irish soda bread is yummy!! They are sampling it now!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location in Seville Shopping Center.  Food very good as well as service.  Manager (can't remember his name) was super friendly.  We will definitely return for \"seconds\"."}
{"text":"My coworker likes to eat here when we're at the mall over lunch, and honestly, the place had to grow on me (seriously half a year).  I've worked out my formula -- a half sandwich (winner: roast beef gorg) and a pastry or dessert (winner: palmier but I'm working thru the ho hum case).

What has won me over:  fresh, chewy breads, the mgr who is bussing tables alongside the rest of the staff, the bussers themselves are friendly, a microwave if you have to heat up small kid's food, even a courtesy phone!  They really try to make your whole experience pleasant... the level of detail to customer orientation is pretty amazing, it's all in small ways but adds up. 

Actually the phone is what gave it the 4th star... it's just soooo... courteous.  Goodness forbid I'm without my cell or the battery is dead, but I will appreciate that phone is there one day.. I'm sure."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot. Free WiFi and outlets at the bar to plug in your stuff!!"}
{"text":"My first wildflower experience and it was great! I had the new Farmhouse farro salad and it was delicious (although I wish there had been more sweet potato in mine - just a couple of pieces In my salad). Great portion sizes and very tasty!"}
{"text":"What great customer service! Samantha helped us figure out what items could be easily made vegan. She was super friendly! The quinoa salad was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best soup and sandwich chain that I've tried in Arizona. I'm in love with the potato cream cheese soup and pretty much all the salads! And I can never just walk past the pastry display, especially with those colorfully-iced cupcakes. Can't think of anything that I can complain about!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I go back and forth on this place.  My favorite foods are always their seasonal dishes which is a bit frustrating.  I will continue to go because this preggo needs my potato cream cheese soup.  It is the only thing that makes me happy right now.  Normally I get the wildflower salad with it.  The other day I ordered the caesar salad with it and it was AWFUL.  I mean the worst salad I've ever had.  Romaine lettuce, mushrooms (wtf?) and parmesan.  I think there might have been dressing on it, but there was so little and I couldn't taste it and so I don't really know. 

That is the only horrid food I've had there though.  Everything else is okay and if you get to try the pulled pork sandwich in spring or the summer club you will be in for a treat."}
{"text":"Food was great!  The service not so much.  Took us over 20 minutes to get our food and no one checked on us after to make sure all was well. The area was a little dirty and disorganized. The sandwiches brought the rating up from 2 to 3 stars. Little TLC and easily a 4-5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a tuna sandwich,  it should have been called a cheese and mustard sandwich.  There wasnt a table spoon of tuna between 2 pieces of stale bread.    Whoever made tbe sandwich must like mustard because the sandwich was dripping in it.  Maybe that was there way of hiding the fact that there was no tuna.  Would have returned the sandwich and  asked for my money back but was boarding a plane.  That is probably banking on."}
{"text":"One of the best bakeries I've been to in my life, their breads and pastries are amazing!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time because the potato and greens soup is amazing and the service is usually great- but today the lady taking my order was rude enough for me to change my review. I expect better service than what I received; she had such an attitude. Martha or Marta or whatever her name was should consider a job outside of customer service in my opinion. Food is great, but I'll head to a different location next time."}
{"text":"I don't really get the draw...
The food is OK but, the line at lunch time is atrocious!! There are even times where there is literally no where to sit. 
Today I had the grilled cheese (had been craving one). It was full of arugula and fresh tomato but the cheese was not very noticeable. If I order a grilled cheese I want cheese to be the star.
I also ordered a cup of mushroom barley soup...that came with no mushrooms? I asked the server and she even seemed perplexed so she went to check with the kitchen. She came back and said I had the right soup...it was a veggie soup with barley. Good but NOT something that should be named after an ingredient that was nonexistence.

Meh."}
{"text":"Very good for the price. They took care of my wife's particular need. The Spicy Cuban was very good."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and very helpful with making my dinner decisions. So it was my first time here and was recommended the chopped salad, it was a tasty suggestion but the salad was super small for how much I was paying for it and had hardly and salmon on it, but oh my gosh the dressing was super amazing!!! I also ordered 3 desserts the brownie, chocolate cake, and the coconut cake they weren't sweet but they had a lot of different flavors going on in each one of them which was a little overwhelming. Overall I'm feeling a good sense of satisfaction in the foodI'll probably be back to try a couple different salads."}
{"text":"Always looking for good spots while in Phoenix. This was a solid miss. Long wait for mediocre food, so so service and the restaurant environment could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS! So good. The food was extremely fresh & it was brought out quickly. The people working were really friendly too. Their produce tasted really fresh like it was just brought in. And the food was warm when we got it, nothing had been sitting out. The restaurant was also clean and cute. Definitely recommend and we will be coming back when we visit AZ for spring training again!"}
{"text":"I go here for the tuna sandwich and lemonade. Clean, energetic, hear a lot of dishes clanking and fast moving servers, nice and friendly staff. Very busy place I like it."}
{"text":"Wildflower is my favorite place when compared to Panera, zupas, etc.... they have a great selection of salads and breads.  You can always ask for specific breads for sandwiches.  Lunch time can be busy but worth it and this location will make sure you are taken care of if your order comes out wrong or takes too long!

Their cranberry scones and cookies are absolutely the best!  
Wish they would have their pastas available for lunch instead of 3pm."}
{"text":"I come here infrequently, but it doesn't make it any less delicious. When I feel like treating myself I get breakfast here. I used to go eat here with my boyfriend after hiking on Thunderbird Mountain. 

I've had pretty much every breakfast item, but my favorite is the ham and Brie frittata with apples. It has so much flavor, they never over salt it, and it comes with sourdough toast and rosemary home fries. The eggs are always perfectly cooked, and they don't skimp on the Brie, ham or apples. Every bite is the same amount of deliciousness. It's exactly the same every time, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

The sourdough bread has the perfect \"tanginess\" that one would expect with a good sourdough. It has the perfect crunchy exterior. I might add that I am extremely picky about my pastries and breads, having gone to culinary school. 

The cinnamon roll was something I hadn't tried before, I picked one up for mu daughter. It was HUGE! It was great that the cinnamon roll dough was tender. Some places tend to overwork the dough, and you can tell in the finished product. The frosting isn't cloyingly sweet, and there is an okay amount of cinnamon. It was pretty good, but the only thing was, it didn't \"wow\" me with the overall flavor. I look for appearance, flavor, and texture. Unfortunately it was a little lackluster in the flavor department."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and soup... Courteous staff.. Perfect spot for a quick snack in between flights"}
{"text":"My three children and I came in yesterday for lunch and got food poisoning from the potato soup and possibly something else. Vomiting, and stomach pain for me and my 11, 9, and 23 month old kids. We won't be back. Beware!"}
{"text":"Just tried Wildflower's new Fall spicy and sweet butternut squash salad. It was amazing! The cayenne pepper gives it a kick and then the sweet corn, cranberries and candied pecans compliment the flavor! Anthony (manager) came over and was so friendly. He asked how everything was and genuinely wanted to know how I liked the new salad. My daughter and I have been going to this same Wildflower ever since she was born, she's now 13 and we still love eating there together. As cheesy as this sounds, we've created a lot of memories eating soup, salad, sandwiches and let's not forget...the yummy chocolate chip cookies they make! Thank you Anthony for great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was surprised coming into Wildflower. The restaurant was not what I expected. Very clean, and was greeted by very friendly staff. I have never been there before and for a first experience it was a great one. I want to give a shout out to one employee especially, Daniel Stock! He helped me out very much, especially with what was good to order. I took his advice, and was not disappointed! Thank you Daniel!!"}
{"text":"I just do not get the appeal of places like this. 
The line was long and very slow moving, with only one register open. My friend and I each had the 1/2 sandwich & soup special with iced teas. The total came to over $25!!!!
The seating is so cramped, you constantly have people bumping into you. I had to send back my blt. The square orange cheese was hard and cold. The bacon was so overcooked it crumbled into dust when i touched it.
They did replace the sandwich without questions and the turkey was a little better. All toppings were piled in the middle of the bread and the mustard was in one big glob. There is no attention to detail here and the food is below mediocre.
Not the place for me at all."}
{"text":"I like this place even though it is a chain because they are pretty consistent. They are connected with Changing Hands Bookstore, so when i typically go i eat and then go search for books with my daughter.  I love their Oriental Chicken Salad which is a pretty generous serving, and i will never forget their chocolate croissants.  I crave those everyday now.  Food is made pretty quickly and there is usually lots of seating but is pretty busy of a place.  I know if i move and go to one of these places i will be happy."}
{"text":"Mostly I get the 1/2 salad 1/2 sandwich deal. Today felt like a bowl of soup. The spicy chicken enchilada soup was short on chicken. Very small pieces of chicken throughout the soup wasn't enough to make this a hearty soup. But the flavor was good and it had just enough spice. The grilled corn was a nice touch and it came with a piece of fresh bread. This location is always very clean and usually quite busy. The iced tea keeps me coming back and I love their shortbread cookies."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We eat here a few times a month and the food is always yummy and service is always great. Staff is super friendly. I wish I remembered to look at the girl's name who helped us the last time we stopped in. She was engaging, funny and not at all frustrated by the fact that we came in 10 minutes until close. (We were getting food to go and thought they were open until 10. We aren't usually THOSE people.) But like I said, she was cheerful anyway and had us laughing and smiling. 
A huge plus is the variety! Lots of vegetarian options and it's always hard to decide what to get. I highly recommend the pasta primavera, hummus plate and the soup bread bowls!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale and met a new friend for lunch at the Pima location. When I told the staff I needed gluten free they immediately made suggestions and offered choices that worked for me. The food was good and the staff was accommodating and friendly. They made me feel so welcome as a new Scottsdale resident."}
{"text":"Not to bad of a egg sandwich eggs were fluffy and the bread was soft and flavorful a little pricey but it at the airport so not to bad would try it again in town"}
{"text":"Love, love, love.. all of the fresh bread is amazing, the salads are unbelievable, the service is great and very fast and their baked goods and pies are amazing.  The staff is so helpful."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Chandler Fashion location so I figured this would be a good lunch spot to meet a colleague.

She enjoyed her chicken Caesar salad, and said the mushrooms added were different but she ended up liking them.  She also liked her passion fruit iced tea.  My ham and Swiss was basic but of good quality, and the potato cream cheese soup was a generous bowl that was delicious as always.  Add some black pepper and dip your bread in it and it is spectacular.

The employees were competent and hard working during the lunch rush, and even though the place was pretty crowded, there were still open tables and it was not too loud.

Usually my soup comes with a side of bread though, and this time it didn't, so taking off a star for that.

It's a step above the disappointment that Paradise/Panera has become, and even though it's a little bit longer of a wait than the likes of Subway, Wildflower is an excellent lunch spot with great parking, albeit right off of a very busy street.  I've had their breakfast at Chandler before too, and I polished off all of my stuffed French Toast, so I can vouch for that too."}
{"text":"Their food quality is what Paradise used to be before the Panera buy-out.  It's more a fast-casual style though, and not the cafeteria style some Paradise still use.  Also, no free cookie, and the baked goods I've had were dry.  But still, solid five stars because...

The potato cream choose soup is insanely good.  Ridiculously good.  And if their online nutrition facts are to be believed, not as fattening as you'd think!  Try get extra bread to dip in it!

They also have (and sounds a little strange) really, really good garlic bread!  The pasta and salmon I've had from here were also really good, and all the sandwiches have been solid 3-5 star quality.  The stuffed french toast could've been a little more nuanced, but overall was just fine.

This is a nice, relaxing go-to place for a lighter meal at the mall."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Wildflower.  First time at this location and of course did not disappoint.  The sourdough is so fresh  and tasty.  I wish there were locations in California, but I am glad Arizona is not too faraway."}
{"text":"What I love most about this place is:

1. Pesto Chicken pasta
2. Portion sizes are big
3. Endless samples of their bread of the day

 
I've told people this before, that I'm a true 'bread person' through and through. You don't know what that means? It means that I tend to get full off the complimentary bread before my meal even makes it to the table. There's just something about bread+butter.... mmm..


ANYWAY, this is a nice \"let's talk over lunch\" or \"read my book over lunch\" kinda place. Definitely a bistro meets internet cafe tone. Perfect ambiance for a lunch date, a working lunch, or a hungry bite if you're getting your tires rotated next door. It's not really an \"in and out\", as it takes a while to get your order but you can kill time here easily."}
{"text":"Meh. Went for a tuna sandwich without cheese or mustard. It was pretty bland, bread was too soft. Overpriced. I walked every gate looking for something different to take onto my flight. There are about 20 restaurants all exactly the same. I guess if you like Turkey and provolone there are probably some good dining options here. Dreadful."}
{"text":"Wildflower is a frequent stop for me mainly out of convenience to the train park across the street. My go-to here is the Almond Tuna Sandwich. It's a light sandwich and really a great mix of tuna, apples, nuts and maybe a few other ingredients. Instead of potato salad I would suggest getting the potato/sweet potato chip mix. 
Each time I have digressed from the Tuna, I've been dissatisfied. I don't know what it is, but I don't find Wildflower to be an above average meal. I wish there was an LGO in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since my husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday and we vowed not to go so long again! Not only was the food superb - potato soup and BLT for hubby, Tuscan Kale salad for me - but the personality of the staff made you feel so wanted! Manager, Tracy and Asst. Mgr Ty, greeted us warmly and enthusiastically. At the end of our meal, a server came by to clear our plates and was asked by my husband what was the special ingredient in the mayonnaise. A slender young woman with a long ponytail replied that she wasn't sure and immediately went to find out ! What great customer service and KUDOS to Wildflower for superb staff training!"}
{"text":"Value for money! Portion size is worth the price. Quality and taste was very good. We had wildflower salad, cauliflower soup and roasted sweet potato sandwich."}
{"text":"Thank You Wildflower Bread Company for the gift card. I came back from Louisiana to visit my family and of course came here today to eat. Everything was excellent as it was on my previous visit.  This will definitely be a go-to place for me from now on. I love love love the bread and butter sample table!  Anyone reading this- you have to make Wildflower a stop on your trip through Scottsdale.  My only request?...please get some reusable plastic cups in...my second visit and still no plastic cup to take home and think of you with every sip!"}
{"text":"Wow. I usually visit here for lunch but today stopped in for breakfast. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with mixed berry compote and a side of turkey sausage. Amazing. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the compote scrumptious. It also came with warm maple syrup which was a perfect accompaniment to the savory turkey sausage. Service was great. I'll definitely think of them for breakfast again...the menu had frittatas, egg sandwiches, protein bowls, and more."}
{"text":"I am giving some additional stars back due to the great customer service from the owner. He promptly reached out to me and is going to address the concerns that I had here. 

This location is slow but the food is still delicious. I do not encourage to use them for to-go ordering. 

The Butternut Squash Ravioli and the Chopped Salad are my go-to. 

I will be back in the future to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go, so I can't speak on the ambiance. I am from out of town and the Wildflower Bread Co. was very easy to find nestled in a strip mall close to the freeway. There was no line when we arrived and the cashier was very friendly.
With that said, I'm glad I had the foresight to check the ingredients for the dressing on the V12 salad before drenching my salad in it--the Mediterranean vinaigrette has cheese in it and I am vegan. Vinaigrette is usually a safe option for people avoiding dairy. Nothing on the menu is marked with the special diet symbols (vegetarian, vegan, etc.) but they have a key for on the bottom of the menu. Kind of confusing, but at least they are transparent with their ingredients online.
The salad sans dressing tasted fine, which is a testament to how fresh and flavorful their produce is."}
{"text":"I had a Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich which had scrambled eggs, sausage, sundried tomatoes, feta, spinach and chipotle sauce on a grilled brioche roll for $6.89 and it was kinda sloply put togeater. I also had the bloodorange lemonaid which was tasty. All in all a good meal, my go to place for food when I fly."}
{"text":"I went to Wildflower to get a quick bite to eat with a friend.  We both ordered a bowl of Garden Vegetable Soup.  It was good but too salty.  The bread that came with it was plentiful and yummy.  The set up of this place (and the high prices for soup lol) reminded me of a NYC deli; I really liked that.  I also enjoyed their outside seating area."}
{"text":"I stopped in today and had the chopped salad with chicken. Fabulous salad and prompt service. Frank the manager was very helpful as well. Great place for quick and fabulous food!"}
{"text":"Wildflower, Scottsdale/Seville Location. Healthy, fresh, consistent...with great customer service. Wildflower consistently goes above and beyond for our family of five. Employees are kind to modify each of our orders to our specific liking. Always with a smile and never getting frustrated. Never hesitating to offer samples of soup or answering any of our questions. Love the \"can do\" attitude. Keep up the good work Wildflower! *Kudos to Casandra who is always extra kind to our family making sure we are all very well taken care of. Wildflower, please give Casandra the recognition that she deserves. It's service like hers that keeps us going back."}
{"text":"I do like Wildflower, but I dont know if I could recommend it.  If you are looking for a pretty good/filling salad this is a good spot.  If you're looking for a great sandwich, I'd sort of say look elsewhere.  
I can recommend the Asian chicken salad, it's good.
It kind of comes down to price oddly enough, the salads are satisfying enough to be worth it, the sandwiches not quite as much, weird for a bakery right?"}
{"text":"Tuna sandwich was gross. Couldn't finish it. Caesar salad was even worse. They put sauteed mushrooms in it? So weird. Overpriced too."}
{"text":"I love this place! The salads were amazing! And the chocolate chip cookie was a perfect sweet treat!"}
{"text":"I like bakeries, breakfast, and booths.  Since this eatery has all 3, naturally I am a fan.  However, I was here for a quick lunch date and didn't get to partake in the breakfast menu.  The lunch is equally enjoyable.  All of the sandwiches are served on their house-made selection of fresh baked breads.

Wildflower has a large glass display of mouth-watering bakery items right as you walk up to order.  In my case,  I unintentionally held up the line to pick a pastry from my top 10 list to accompany my meal before I even peruse the menu board.  It usually takes me quite awhile to order from their extensive menu, but in this case I knew what I wanted right away.  I ordered the roasted sweet potato half-sandwich combo with the cucumber, feta and red onion salad.  The sweet potato sandwich is served on focaccia bread with fresh mozzarella, fig confit, arugula, tomato, marinated fennel, balsalmic vinaigrette and of course roasted sweet potato slices.  It was delicious!  My date ordered the chicken continental sandwich complete with swiss, marinated mushrooms, carmelized onions, romaine, tomato, honey mustard on a ciabatta roll.  It was amazing, apparently...if you like those sort of ingredients.  The pumpkin chocolate chip muffin was dessert and played the dissappearing act with how we devoured it!

Their breakfast menu boasts items like lemon ricotta pancakes and roasted tomato, feta, and egg sandwiches.  Their salad selection is one of the biggest I've seen.  Some of their listed salads are the caribbean cobb with jerk chicken, chopped salad with salmon, and the wildflower salad with cilantro-lime vinaigrette.  They even have fresh pasta served daily! 

The environment is very accomodating to business needs with individual outlets per booth and movable oversized chairs for meetings.  

If I was forced to write one negative thing about this restaurant, I would say that their tea selection is small.  When I say small, I mean there is only one to select from.  It was a good tasting tea and a very good selection on my part as an alternative to soft drinks.  

This is my VERY first review, so I hope that you have found it useful and enlightening."}
{"text":"MMMMMM  Potato Cream Cheese Soup MMMMM

1/2 Sandwich and Potato Cream Cheese Soup .... GREAT lunch!"}
{"text":"I came in with my two year old daughter to waste a bit if time while waiting for a nearby store to open. I ordered a muffin, a scone, an orange juice and a coffee it was nearly $15. They handed it all to me with no tray and told me where the microwave was. So, I got fast food service for restaurant prices. Everything was okay, but not worth the price or hassle."}
{"text":"Simple, well prepared food. Not the cheapest sandwich shop, but it is consistently high quality. The best part is the bread. It's all good, but I especially like the ciabatta. And being next to changing hands and trader joe's doesn't hurt!

Some favorites:

Chicken continental, sweet potato sandwich for something different, roast beef and gorgonzola."}
{"text":"Great service today. Got my annual fix with the Turkey Cranberry Walnut Stuffing Bread Sandwich. Wish they had it as a regular, but I'll be happy to have it in the fall."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now for breakfast meetings when in Scottsdale.  It's a nice place to meet since they offer a private room for meetings and you can obviously provide food for attendees straight from the Wild Flower Bread Company via banquet style or ordered individually.  Service is always attentive and good and lattes and cappuccinos are made pretty well.  As for the food, quite average.  Scrambled egg dishes could probably be less dry and as for breakfast sandwiches, they're pretty basic (although the breads they make and use for sandwiches are quite good).  This place reminds me of The Corner Bakery that we have here in S. Cal. but perhaps not as good on food quality and offerings.  Still, it's a nice space with a lot of seating and has a bright, chipper vibe that helps kick start your morning."}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. 

My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.

It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Went to grab some dinner and was waited on by Ciara who was simply awesome!  She made excellent recommendations and very patient with us!  Then when we sat down and Kathleen brought us our dinner she noticed my daughter made a face at the potato salad and without hesitation asked if there was something else she could bring her....talk about OUTSTANDING service!   BTW. ...the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I love to go here for lunch. At one point, we were going everyday. I'm so in love with the potato cream cheese soup, that's all I love to order! The breads at Wildflower are so good.

This past winter season, I tried the (seasonal) Prime Rib sandwich... and typically I'm not a fan of such a thing... but I loved it! I'm waiting for it to come back so i can order it!

This establishment is clean and the workers are really nice. It's always busy around lunch time and the parking is horrible so you have to time it right. 

I'm waiting for the day they start serving their afternoon pastas for lunch! They all look so good and I'm always bummed that pastas aren't served until after 3pm!"}
{"text":"I'm writing an update for Wildflower Bread Company because I feel my first review may have been a little harsh.

Yes I had to wait, yes the particular sandwich I had wasn't exactly up to par that day BUT I appreciate more than ever a company who values and respects their customers and reaches out to them when they see someone didn't have the best possible experience. After my review, I was emailed by the owner of Wildflower apologizing for my sub par experience and what the company could do to make my experience better, etc... etc... I was completely taken back and surprised because NO other company has ever contacted me about a review, good or bad. I thought this was great and because of it, I am MORE than willing to give Wildflower another go. 

Any suggestions on menu options from my fellow Yelpers?? Message me your favorites! 

Thank you again Louis, you're pretty rad."}
{"text":"yummmy...I live for their potato cream cheese soup in a bread bowl.  It is an obsession of mine...the bread bowl makes it that much better!  Then to top it off the cupcakes with chocolate frosting and the fruit tart is FABULOUS!!  The iced green tea with guava is refreshing!  I love going here for lunch and dinner...the asian chicken salad is awesome to!!!

**I want to update**
I give this place 5 stars because the customer service could not be better!  I will continue to go here forever!  Thank you Wildflower!!!

**Update Again**
I just need to say that the management and staff at this location are the most amazing people in the entire world!  They have the most wonderful food and I would just like to say the hummus plate with chicken in the most delicious thing in the world!  The new Cheddar Braised Beef sandwich...OMG its awesome!  This place deserves an award!"}
{"text":"Jim the general manager and the owner have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort correcting the \"speed of the food coming out\" issue and it has paid off. Yesterday the service was great, the food came out fast, and it actually seemed like it tasted better than before. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Tina is awesome! Was a great help! It was our first time in and we didn't know what to expect. She helped us choose items off the menu and they were amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and service, i come here often before work. I always order the tuscan kale salad, my only complaint is inconsistency. In the last month my kale has consisted of arugula most days, and sometimes i receive butter with my bread, sometimes i dont. So 4/5 from me."}
{"text":"I really liked the salad menu selections.  I picked out the Emerald Spinach Salad based on how good it looked when it was being served to another customer.  I believe it is a fantastic way pick out lunch.  Very nice combo of spinach, Gorgonzola, strawberries, pecans and grapes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Very similar to Panera bread. However when the employee dropped my salad off at my table I was completely grossed out. I'm uploading some photos of my plate. There were thumb prints and greasy wipe marks all over the outside of my salad plate. It looked like it hadn't been washed in weeks. Also my friend asked for a side of chips with their sandwich (which comes free with it) and we somehow got a side of chips plus the chips on the plate with the sandwich. We checked the receipt and we were charged twice for chips...even though they come free with a sandwich order!?! Awful"}
{"text":"I ordered the V12 Kale salad which does not come with chicken. Being a vegetarian I am very cautious when ordering salads to make sure they do not have any meat in them. When I opened my salad at home I was very surprised to see that they put chicken in it anyways even though I paid the non chicken price. I sent in a note on their website and received a call within minutes. They offered to deliver to me a new salad with no meat and even refunded my money! 

The salad arrived in a timely manner and was perfect. They may have messed up my order which happens sometimes, but to go above and beyond to ensure I was happy really shows that they do care about their customers. Also, the salad was delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"The roast sweet potato sandwich was amazing! My husband and I very love it! The salad is good too!"}
{"text":"We went 2 days ago, and had drove all the way from Ahwatukee for their bread bowls! When we were ready to order, we were told they ran  out & my daughter was super bummed. We almost left . The cashier gal even let her pick a pastry for her inconvenience. I ended up talking the girls into staying.
They had the Salmon pasta dish and I had the BLT sandwich & soup combo. Food was great as always!

As we were leaving, the mgr, Anthony caught us outside with a bag in his hand. They found 2 bread bowls and even packed some soup for my daughter! Was an awesome gesture and we were very grateful! Thank you again for your courtesy!"}
{"text":"Had a decent amount of gluten free items and my salad was fantastic! The Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate salad was great!"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants I can find delicious low sodium fare. The Wildflower salad with grill salmon is the prefect venture for my dietary needs. 
Gavin provides great service at the Deer Valley location. And if you're going to bust the diet, try the ginger biscotti cheese cake!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to be.  I come here frequently and it's always been excellent. The tuna salad, omlets, chocolate muffin, coffee....all very very good. A good place to do computer stuff too....plenty of outlets and I have never had a problem connecting.  Nice outdoor area and a comfortable scene inside and the service and friendliness has always  been impeccable. 
    If you're not one of those ass type people....then come here and you'll be satisfied.....pain-the-ass people stay away."}
{"text":"The best Reuben sandwich I have ever eaten in my life, the carmelized onion kraut totally made the flavor and the tender shaved thin corned beef was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Not as good as Corner Bakery in Dallas area, but along the same lines.   Would help if they had some egg white offerings.  Service ok.  Coffee better than average."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places to go. Deliciously filling salads, yummy pastas and soups. Sandwiches are good too (the only thing I tweak is the bread for softer options) otherwise perfect! Oh and their desserts and other baked goods are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. My daughter likes healthy so we tried the Wildflower.  I had the chopped salad. Very good. My husband had the pasta. He also liked it. Being Italian he did need to ask for more sauce. My daughter had the salad and enjoyed. I tried a cup of the Sedona chicken soup. To my taste, it was not a homemade taste. You could tell the thick consistency was a store made concoction. Ok at best. This concept reminds me of Panera. It was ok, but really wouldn't be my go to place."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE 

We went to Wildflower for dinner. About two hours later my husband gets violently sick vomiting and diarrhea. Then about an hour after him I start throwing up and running to the bathroom. This has gone on all night. Never have we been this sick. 
Called the restaurant and the Manager said he'd refund our money. 
Seriously we are both so sick all day. Can't even hold water down. It's like the scene from The Exorcist!!!!!
I have a compromised immune system. 
It's not like we ate tacos off a stand in Rocking Point. 
I guess if you go in the evening the food and ice tea just isn't fresh. 
Been going on for over 18 hrs now without much relief. May need an ER visit 
Never going here again!!!!!
Shove your refund"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a bad experience here!
The bread is incredible and I love that they leave samples out to try!
We got the pumpkin pie for thanksgiving and it was perfect! 
They have a delicious chopped salad!
And I love trying their lemonades and teas!"}
{"text":"Found this location on yelp and am so happy I did ! Fresh and healthy options ! Right up my alley ! Ended up coming here 2 days in a row! So sad they only have locations in Arizona . Great place - great price - service was amazing and everyone was extremely friendly ."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  There are a lot of people who seem to be regulars which gives this restaurant a home-town feel to it.  There was a slight mixup with our order but the manager give it his personal attention (including a sincere apology) and immediately fixed the problem. I thought we received fantastic customer service.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for fresh flavors and great service."}
{"text":"Been a patron since this eatery first opened.  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.  The food is that fabulous!  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.  

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)

Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.  :-)  Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I wanted something refreshing, light, healthy and quick to eat. So I decided to stop by The Wildflower Bread Company. I'm so glad I did! 

The food was very delicious and what I ordered was perfect! This is way better than the typical fast food joint. I order a half Almond Tuna sandwich and a side wildflower salad. I got my food in under 10 minutes and I went around 2pm so it wasn't that busy. I can just imagine what the lunch hour is like...this place is awesome! 

They also have an impressive dinner menu. I had no idea! And it's very affordable. 

The service was great and the atmosphere is very easygoing and comfortable. I ordered my food to go and the person that waited on me offered me a glass of water! Very nice touch. 

I will be coming here on a regular basis. I just wish I was a visitor to this restaurant a lot sooner than yesterday!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going there and I had their grilled cheese sandwich and it was amazing. Their coleslaw was also really good. The price is on the higher side but still worth it. You can tell the ingredients are fresh. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, lunch spot, top-notch customer service and yes, decent non-Starbuckian Iced Coffee!

For breakfast, I suggest Lemon Ricotta short stack...
For lunch, Chicken Pomegranate Pistachio salad..."}
{"text":"I didn't get what I ordered, but Wildflower is always such a good environment for catching up with friends."}
{"text":"A pricer place to eat but it is totally worth it! Food is made fresh and it is very good. I recommend the chicken parmesan meal with one of their ever changing soup options. They also do an excellent job of updating their menu with seasonal options. This place is usually packed no matter what time of day I go, so be prepared to fight for a seat!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Weve been goung to this location since they frist opened. Petty good coffee three ice teas to choose from as well as lemonade. And the good thing is the drinks are all self serve. Great food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Freshly made to order and always a vegan option and most times more then one vegan option. All the bakery items ie muffins, cakes, cinnimon rolls are all made in house. No fuss about going up to the counter to ask the server for a refill your drink. Always different daily soup. Cakes and fresh made breads to take home. Whole or they can slice it if you so desire. 
Large open and relaxing dinning area. 
With lots of space. No fuss no hassle.
Enter the large doors place your order take a seat and somebody will bring your food to you.
This is a very popular place with people of all ages. Nice place for group meetings, family dinner or if your solo lots of comfortable seating to choose from.
This type of business is sorely lacking in Portland Oregon. Wildflower Bread Company. Good business. Smart business. Makes people happy."}
{"text":"An amazing place for a nice lunch with family and friends! Went there with my family and the staff treated us outstanding. 
Our food was to die for and it kept us full till the end of the day. I admit, it's quite pricey but you won't be let down with the wonderful food selection. 
Would return again in the near future!"}
{"text":"This wildflower store is one of my favorites to come to have breakfast. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I believe it can improve. One day I came to have breakfast there where many tables that where not being clean. I like coming to the because the food is great and getting good service from a young lady with purple glasses, didn't quite get her name but she does a great job.=)"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because cheers to airport food that's actually really great!
 
   ---   ---   ---

Before making the flight all the way back to Tampa, I knew that it would be smart to grab something to eat at the airport. I'd only been to PHX  one other time, so I had no idea what restaurant options I'd find, but I found the selection to be pretty solid compared to most airports. I walked by a burger place that I was super tempted to order from, but then I noticed the really great reviews at Wildflower.

As I was reading glowing review after glowing review, I was looking at the menu and a bit confused. These looked like some pretty basic sandwiches, and while I love a good sandwich, the nearby burger option was tempting me. 

But I went and order the sandwich and after one bite, I completely understood why this place is so beloved. The bread is amazing. Why is the bread not like this at every sandwich shop? I'm not sure but this simple sandwich was probably one of the ten best things I've ever eaten an airport.

I actually don't even remember what the sandwich was called. My wife happened to take a trip to Phoenix one week after me, and per my recommendation, she ended up ordering the same thing. She insists it was called a grinder, but there's nothing on the Wildflower online menu that's called a grinder. Either way, it was some kind of ham in between toasted bread and I wish I could have one every day.

I also scored some chips that I'd never seen before and loved them. Again, I don't remember the name brand because I'm really terrible at this whole \"writing reviews\" thing, but keep an eye out for an interesting chip selection.

Lastly, I ordered the Georgie Peach smoothie (I remembered the name!) which was delicious but probably just a pinch sweeter than I would have preferred. I like things that are sweet but this was *really* sweet. Still, I could tell it was made with love.

To top it all off, the employees working here were super nice and friendly - not the norm at airport eateries! This was definitely a very memorable experience for a fast-casual airport spot!"}
{"text":"If you believe bread makes a great sandwich, you will want to check out this place. I had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted. You could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully. I will be back."}
{"text":"Have not stopped at this location in a while but now it's so close to campus! Mike at the front is great and very sweet. He had enough knowledge to make recommendations and he was very patient with my friend and I when we stopped in for lunch. The food was great. The blood orange lemonade is a must. However, no refills on that but very worth it. I also recommend the meatball sub! Best thing on the menu. The bathrooms are clean and everything is very well maintained in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been on what it felt like a never-ending search for a good, healthy and tasty food at airports. When I traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, I found this spot, a bit far from my gate, but I was willing to walk 15 -20 min inside the terminal for a good food.

Seems like a popular spot at this airport, it had a long line, but the line moved quickly with efficient staffs. They had some seating, but it was mostly taken.

Most of the people were ordering salad or sandwiches, and they were pre-made and ready to go in the window showcase. Their staff make them in the kitchen right in the back, so they are pretty darn fresh! It helped with the purchasing process, and to move the line along.

Since I was going to get on a flight home, and I was not getting any food on the plane, I decided to get a scone and a salad. I chose Chocolate Chip Scone which was bigger than I expected. It was very satisfying and delicious!

Then I found a nice surprise in a bag, my salad came with a complimentary bread! I could tell it was not some cheap piece of bread, but high quality one. How awesome!

For salad, I chose Wildflower Chopped Salad, and it was a really nice, big salad! It was super fresh and put together beautifully. The quality was very noticeably high. Lots of texture, flavor and ingredients mixed together in a perfect harmony and became one big delicious family! An awesome salad!!!

I also couldn't help myself from getting one of their popular cookies... Chocolate Chip Hazelnut Cookie with Sea Salt which was huge, bigger than my hand. It was soft, moist, again with all the high quality ingredients. Yum!!!

Kudos to wildflowers! Now I know it is possible to eat well at an airport! Everything I had was just amazingly delicious, high quality, healthy... All we need now is to have Wildflower Bread Company at each and every airports!"}
{"text":"We come here to relax and eat comfort food made in healthy ways. All the baked foods are made on-site...all the bread is perfect and the sweets are decadent. The chocolate croissants are flaky, buttery, warm pockets of smiling yummmm!!!
The management is on point, even the employees like them and their smiles are genuine. One of the managers, Anthony, offered to sourced out and have delivered in one of their signature clear plastic drink tumblers just for me, cause I wanted the pink one and all this location have left are clear and orange. He went above and beyond to provide this additional customer service. I use it every time we come in and feel special when I do."}
{"text":"Can you say yum! Finally a place that makes bread. The soggy dough in your average supermarket can't be called bread. As a European and a grand daughter of a baker, this place gets it. The only sad thing is that bread is pricey here. We went for breakfast here last week. Fabulous coffee and free refills. Awesome passionfruit ice tea ( I had to try both).
Even the kids menu was great. Cute sand dollar size pancakes.
Another plus, they have the Hero brand jelly. Great Swiss quality I used to back home. All fruity goodness without the high fructose corn syrup. Yay.
Will be back many, many times and get the holiday bread. Willing to shell out a bit more to even buy their loaves."}
{"text":"On August 5th, my husband and I stopped in for an afternoon bite. As always service was quick and food was delicious. Pastries always look very enticing and are delicious. Staff are friendly and always checking if there is any additional service needed. The restaurant is always clean. The body lotion in the women's restroom is a unexpected touch. A special shout out to Kamyren for his diligence and attention to servicing the area. Although unsupervised, he seemed very much into his job. All around, we had a very enjoyable meal. Our compliments to the store manager and his staff. We will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Dining here has always been delightful; however, Friday proved disappointing! Our delicious salads were delivered by an assistant manager who seemed to enjoy flinging my salad across the table and ended up slamming into my arm! I addressed the matter with him to no avail! This staffer ruins the experience and enjoyment of this venue!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  I took my bf to Wildflower for the first time today.  He was very impressed!  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable!  We asked for a lot of random things (the cheese on his sandwich on the side and substituted for another, our pastry warmed up, salad dressing on the side, etc) and they got every little thing correct and catered to our every need.  Brandon was awesome too!  He happily helped us and engaged us in lovely conversation that made us feel welcome.  It was a very pleasant lunch, thank you Wildflower Palm Valley!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a cup of coffee on my way out of town. Sitting on the plane I finished it and my last gulp came down with some kinda of nasty string and nasty pieces of I don't know what! Disgusting. How can this happen? I'm on the plane now so I can't go back."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here for awhile, And usually order the half sandwich half soup combo. I think customer service is on point ! The Bread is fantastic !     Parking is bear at times but would not deter me from coming back !"}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread is my favorite place to eat in Goodyear. I love the options that they have for breakfast and lunch and their soups are always good as well. The food is always fresh and contains ingredients that you can't get anywhere else. There is a lot of seating which is great considering how busy they get. They always have plenty of staff working to make sure things run smooth which is also a huge plus. Much better than paradise bakery!"}
{"text":"Yep, go here. Had this place in Phoenix, and this location is better. The Phx one is good, but this one you can tell caters to Scottsdale. Great robust menu, my meal was perfect. They actually put a nice fancy twist to my grilled cheese, and the add-on's were delicious. Clean / trendy / healthy spot. A little busy ...but  it was lunchtime and this place is new/good."}
{"text":"This place is delicious...my go to for yummy food. I'm not a big foodie so don't judge. 

Potato soup with fruit salad extra granola please!

Oh and the banana bread is to die."}
{"text":"This place would have received a 4 star because breakfast taste great every time but the vibe and product delivery was a disappointment ."}
{"text":"I went here today on a whim. I ordered the short stack of pancakes and a cappuccino, my fiance ordered the Taylor Ham and Egg Sandwich and a ice Vanilla Latte. The pancakes were delicious, nice, fluffy, and moist! I loved the syrups that went with the pancakes, one was a classic maple syrup and the other was a sweet berry mixture that was refreshing. The cappuccino on the other hand was a little on the weak side; it tasted like watered down milk. I went back and told the young man behind the counter that I wasn't thrilled about the coffee. He offered to add another shot of espresso, didn't charge me extra for it. It tasted pretty good after that! My fiance liked his sandwich but he did say that the bread was very hard to chew. I tried a bite and I agreed. The eggs had good flavor though and were very cheesy. Also had the home fries which tasted great!  All in all was a pretty pleasant experience, nice atmosphere and lots of seating. A little pricey but pretty quality food. I'd try again maybe go for their lunch menu next time.

***UPDATE***

After our visit to Wildflower Bread Company I received a letter from the Founder! He gave me his deepest apologies for my less than stellar experience and also offered to give me a full refund and gift card! Talk about your AWESOME Customer service! It's companies like Wildflower Bread Company that actually go the extra mile for their customers! I really appreciate WBC and will be back to try their lunch menu and write another review!"}
{"text":"This place had great service - Brandon went above and beyond!  Our food was delicious - cannot wait to come back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is consistent in the way they make their food.  Always taste the same no bad surprises.  The staff is knowledgeable and eagerly to help."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! This is a great place for lunch. I usually get their soup and salad or half sandwich special. I always try a different soup every time I'm there and their customer service is outstanding."}
{"text":"This Wildflower is ALWAYS busy. I have been here a handful of times during lunch, and expect that you wont be able to find a place to sit, even after they are done making your food! I have had to stand around to wait for a place, which is very frustrating when you are only on an hour break, but now I know this coming to this place.

Food is always fresh and delicious. Haven't had anything bad here, but I do not like the kale salad here. It is the arugula-type kale, not the traditional and I really do not like the type they serve. Oh well though, I just choose to get something else, and they have plenty to offer. Their soups are really good most of the time, my favorite is the roasted garlic tomato. Their soup changes each day, so make sure you check their website before you go in to make sure it is a day that they serve it. 

I have mainly ordered salads from here, but their sandwiches are really good according to all my friends that have eaten here as well. Their bread is the best!!!!! We have gone here to eat lunch JUST to get a loaf of bread also.

Overall, it would be 5 stars if the location had better seating, but that is a slight overview to me. We will come back here for the fresh food, friendly service, and delicious loaves of bread!"}
{"text":"When they ask me if there is such a thing as too much bread I simply laugh! Chopped Salad sub Chicken is always on point! 

As well Gavin was on point to help me clear my table while I was studying! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here with my best friend since high school...love the potato and cream cheese bread bowl. Unfortunately the last few times we been here the service is only decent..food still wonder full...i am eating here now enjoying the weather, and though the food is great, I'm disappointed that they skimmed on the butter and i had to ask for silver ware. Everything else was great"}
{"text":"Pretty good but, DO NOT be in a hurry.  This will suck up ALL of your lunch hour because, NONE of these servers are in any hurry.  And they say we're \"laid back\" in California.   AZ's got nothin' on us in that department.

As for the food , all I can say is white raisins in the coleslaw BLECGH!  Do not order the turkey pastrami sandwich if you are in the mood for something savory. It is not Savory it is sweet."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have cravings for their soup and sandwich combo every so often. Panera opened up across the street but I still prefer Wildflower over Panera any day. Panera is stuffy. Wildflower always has great customer service and management. They want to make sure you always 100% enjoy your good. I never had anything less than great food here! Love it! Back again and again. Wildflowers portions are bigger than Panera as well for the price. Also Wildflower has better deserts. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not happy. It's not Wildflower, I love them. This location is awful. I got my amazing gift card from my review of Tempe location that I have gone to for years and love love love! I come in today after a really bad day for my salmon pasta which I'm dying for. I'm told they don't make pasta till after 3... I've never had this problem before and don't see this time restriction on the menu....and the way the cashier said it, like it was common sense. I was really upset cuz I was really looking forward to it. I ended up getting one of my usual soup and sandwich combo which was really good as always but not what I was feeling today. I would have given one star cuz I was so angry, but the food was good (as always). And the service is always fast and they even check in on you to see how everything is. Your lucky I love wildflower so much. I would have left."}
{"text":"Wildflower has missed the point in their reply to me, focusing on the fact that they donate day-old bread, but I will continue to monitor and update if they acknowledge the need to change.  Of course they only sever same-day bread. However, the problem is that they pre-slice the fresh bread to save time, causing it to become stale. The baking sector is way too competitive for them to miss the pride and showmanship of slicing a piece of fresh bread seconds before serving it.

As a BREAD company, BREAD should be their pride point. However, half of the sliced bread that they served with our soup was stale. When I asked, they said that they precut all of their bread because it would slow them down and some of it must have not been covered well enough.

Shame on Wildflower BREAD Company. Part of the experience of going to a BREAD bakery is savoring fresh cut BREAD. Wildflower needs to re-think their mission."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today. The food was delicious. Erica, the manager was very nice, professional, and accommodating. I will eat here again because of her excellent customer service and the food was terrific."}
{"text":"Our family dined in on Friday night, and I have never received such excellent service from a Wildflower facility. Truly, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed or wanted. Even my husband, who most always thinks all service is sub-par, exclaimed that the service was superior. It seemed a little quiet on Friday, not sure if that helped, but I cannot say enough good things about the service at this location. Thank you! And, the food was delicious as always too, lol."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I am a picky eater and Wildflower is very accommodating. Each time I order they make it just the way I like it. Fresh, healthy food and the staff is friendly. Their iced green tea is the best in the valley. You can't go wrong with Wildflower."}
{"text":"Their new Superfood Salad is so good that I can bring myself to try the seasonal offering V12 Kale salad. I thought their Wildflower Chopped salad with the smoked salmon was the ultimate, but no more."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with food at this place. The salad looked stale and it was not worth the price I paid for. Will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"They got some bomb food and even better service the young women in the front I believe her name was Stephan and was super helpful and hella cute"}
{"text":"Get in the holiday spirit and try the Turkey Cranberry Walnut Stuffing Sandwich!  This is a preview of a Thanksgiving dinner in a delicious sandwich.  There is always something new at Wildflower that keeps you coming back to taste another seasonal delight!"}
{"text":"So, 980+ miles one way from San Antonio, Texas along the Highway of Roadkill known as I-10, several near death and out of body experiences and a long, long downhill stretch along Route \"What the heck is this place and where are we\" 70, we arrive at the possibly mythical, and definitely fantastical Wildflower Bread Company at this location without hitting a single pothole (because Arizona is good about that) and crashing out.

Mind you between me and my trusty sidekick not named Sancho Panza, we'd covered 48 states and 22 countries between us. We have eaten food that is legitimately intended to kill the aspiring gourmet (Thailand) to \"what the heck is this black tea and where do I get it\" (Latvia) and Wildflower Bread Company is a favorite. Thank you Prescott and Sedona locations, applause applause. This is our first stop in Phoenix.

Jacob, thank you for manning the counter. You are about as tall as a Kodiak and quite the patient and cheery one with a deft touch for the touchscreen (alliteration!?) Kelsey, thank you for being the manager and Brandon \"C\" you are magnificent. And all the other staff, thank you. I can go without food for the rest of the week. I will probably be back sooner than that however, te deum.

And I came back specially to this location to find Meghan is awesome, Liz, Maddy, Jimmy. Alicia, Edgar, and Frankie. Fighting I-17 northbound was beyond ridiculous but I made it out alive. Honestly this Deer Valley location is besides one of the best non-crowded AMC theaters (IMAX 3D and a bar? Yes please) in the area and given a choice between Noodles and Company and Wildflower ... no contest. My pasta is delicious this Year of Our Lord 2018 on the day of April 27th, thank you all for playing \"Shattered Dreams\" by Johnny Hates Jazz in the background music."}
{"text":"Cindy the catering manager, Casey, and Trish (assistant managers) were wonderful! I just had a baby shower earlier this afternoon, and they had everything ready and blocked off for me when I arrived an hour and a half before party time to set up. They were accommodating, friendly, fast, and the room was beautifully kept and easy to set up. They even let us bring in more tables from other areas in the dining room, as well as bring in a couple of my own things for food. I highly recommend Wildflower if you plan on having a small get together - they know what they're doing, the food is wonderful, and they are all super nice! Thank you so much Cindy, Trish and Casey!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, amd it's worth the little extra. Super yummy sandwiches, soups, breads, and other fresh baked yummy. The kale potato soup was awesome, and the roasted sweet potato sandwich was killer. My bf n I shared one of the apricot pistachio rolls, and it was super delicious.... would have been nice to know it had raisins in it tho :( my ONLY complaint, and the reason they get 4stars instead of 5, is the portions. The half sandwich use to be bigger, and the soup was too, yet they charge more. Other than that, this place rocks"}
{"text":"We love Wildflower, but we haven't been here in over a year. Why, you ask? The seating thing stresses me out, especially with two kids in tow. I have to go during off meal times (really early or really late). There has to be a better way to seat people. 

1. You wait in line to place your order. 
2. You find a table after you place your order.
3. Good luck if it's busy. 

I definitely won't go without backup, another adult to scope out a table while I wait in line. 
Sometimes, we are still awkwardly standing there looking for a table (ready to pounce on the lollygaggers taking up a table after their meal and then have to find someone to clean off the table).

It really shouldn't be this stressful or difficult to get a table and have a meal.
Otherwise, food is good, but I'm no longer a regular after having to schlep my kids around. They are a hindrance at getting a table. Anyone that doesn't have kids can outrun you to a table."}
{"text":"A+ 10/10 would recommend. Fantastic food and great service. We'll definitely be coming here more often!!"}
{"text":"Girls love carbs. And the fact that Wildflower has bread in it's very name is a thumbs up for me. 
My office cohorts and I eat here often for lunch and we are never disappointed. The sandwiches are tasty and fresh, the soup is always good (I recommend the chicken coconut curry) and the pastries are top notch(chocolate croissants!). 
And they have bread...enough bread to fulfill every carb lovers wildest dreams.
One complaint: Please get rid of the nasty tomato-bread gunge that comes with the sandwiches. It looks like bird regurgitation. It's as if Wildflower said, \"What should we do with all this leftover bread? I know! let's mash it up, add some tomato flavor to it and present it as if it were a salad.\"
Kudos to the samples of lotion in the ladie's bathroom however. A very nice touch."}
{"text":"My Rating has nothing to do with the food, which was great.  It's about the incredible rudeness of the table clearing staff. I went to Wildflower today for a nice lunch with my friend. As soon as we sat down the noise began.  After a few incredible loud episodes I very nicely asked the worker if he could be a little quieter when placing dishes, silverware and glasses in the bins.  He insincerely replied that he would try.  It was literally 10 seconds later when the threw more dishes into the bins.  OMG!  It was so loud that our conversation was interrupted more than two dozen times during our meal due to spontaneous responses our bodies had to the sharp loud noises.  Another couple sat down next to us not long after I had spoken to the worker.  Within seconds their heads whipped around at the next tossing of dishes.  Over the course of our meals we all bonded on the ridiculously rude and arrogant attitude of this young man.  There is no way management could not hear this racket.  All of us agreed the food was good but we would NEVER return again to eat at Wildflower and instead go to Paradise Bakery which was far more respectful of it's customers.  My other disappointment was that they did not have any gluten free bakery options, sort of crazy they haven't implemented a few options by now."}
{"text":"So I woke up this morning to find out the Federal Government shut down at midnight and I am furloughed. I decided to take this as a cue to drive around today shopping and decided to end it at another awesome Wildflower Bread Company location in order to drown my sorrows in yummy carbohydrates and very delicious sugar.

Mackenzie, Brianna, Erin, Brandon assisted with my caloric overdose and Tina the manager is awesome. Mariah is as well. That is all."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Always great quality healthy food and the workers are always very nice. Breakfast is our favorite"}
{"text":"I was here for my Kiwanis (Downtown Scottsdale Young Professionals) Club meeting in their community room in the back of the restaurant, it's a great place for a meeting if you didn't have a lot of people, however, we had a big turnout and the room was a bit tiny for us.  However, we had a great meeting and got a lot of works done.  I didn't try any of the food there because I wasn't really hungry, but I will definitely go back again there soon."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with the family after a day at the range.  The food was good as always.  They have a new Fritatta. It has cheese, spinach and sun dried tomatoes.  Really really yummy.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"The food was great and love their soups. The server we had (Mr. Djuan) was awesome! Had a good sense of humor and welcoming attitude."}
{"text":"My last visit here was great! I had the Cauliflower Masala soup, and half sandwich.  The soup was amazing!! Glad to see they are incorporating more veggie options and expanded salad choices. I split a desert and that was also yummers. Friendly and outgoing staff make this spot welcoming . Good place for a bite for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch. Italian meatball soup is delish!!! So was the half ham and Swiss sandwich which has they so kindly toasted for me upon request.  Even if they were busy, the staff were all curtious and super nice. Would stop in again in the future."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I crave their potato cream cheese soup more often than I should admit.  It is absolutely delicious. The turkey breast and brie sandwich is my favorite by far but everything there is good. The line is long almost every time I go in but it moves real quickly. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent staff .Excellent service. No doubt the best Wildflower in the Valley. Why? Because it has Excellent management. We make it a point to eat there when at Sky Harbor,  Rich, the manager mingles with the customers, makes sure food and service meet and exceed customer's expectations. We have dined at other Phoenix metro Wildflowers and have concluded those other operations need to send their employees and managers to Wildflower at the airport  for training on how to be customer friendly and serve outstanding food."}
{"text":"This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize. It's worth reading. Please share.

After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.

It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen. 

 He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong. 

By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture. 

A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation.

Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review.

I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate. 

The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing.

The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more.

On the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply....great. 

This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.

I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly. 

Last time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off-morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent.

I am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot.

Louis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people.

When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit."}
{"text":"Great service from Samantha, including directions to our gate. Sandwich and salad were excellent and pricing was more than reasonable, especially in an airport restaurant."}

I really was impressed with her and the store ! 
I will be back soon ...

{"text":"We love coming here!!  The food is a little on the pricey side for what you get but you never leave there feeling like you \"over did it\".  It's pretty much like a soup and sandwich place but during dinner they serve more hot meals.  If you've ever had Panera Bread, I would compare it to that.  I love the fresh ingredients that they use and the breads they make daily.  They've also got a pastry lay out and they are too die for (ESPECIALLY the cheese danish ... YUM!)  My favorite lunch item is the almond tuna sandwich with butternut squash soup (a Pick Two meal).  Service is decent and they are almost always busy.  It's in a relatively large shopping center so parking isn't a problem unless you go at peak ... but you'll just be parking a little further.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Why this Chandler Wilfdlower is better than .. you know who else at the Chandler mall food-court:
-Their salads have great combinations and lost of ingredients
-Their sandwiches are on the inventive and creative side
-Their website has really thorough nutrition and you can customize your salads based what type of nutrition info you're concerned about
-Their staff has always been really friendly & they're quick and keep the place clean
-They rotate their salads/sandwiches (not sure if it's seaonally), but this is how I tried the awesome Cuban sandwich they had not too long ago.
-Their manager lady so awesomely offered my sister a gift-card last time when her order took what the manger thought was \"excessively long\" to bring out... that is with zero complaining or face making.. the Manager just did it on her own.
-PLUS, they have weekly complimentary bread tastings (better than chippers, I think) with butter or olive oil near the check-out line.. yum!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.. the location is convenient for before yoga class nearby.  Their staff has always been friendly and prompt and I like their proximity to the bookstore (which makes me come even more often as I can browse and eat while I kill time before yoga class).

Wildflower has good food overall, so that's a known already... but what stands out about this place is the book store next door and the casualness and openness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly the friendliest staff I have ever met anywhere! One of the women working here, possibly the manager, was floating around checking on the customers sitting in the dining area. I had previously only bought a coffee for a meeting I had at the airport. She came up to me and asked me if I'd like a refill.  How nice!  I took her up on it and we started chatting.  One thing led to another and she made a custom salad for me!  It was amazing!  Pretty sure it was a mix between the spicy super greens and the vegetable quinoa.  It was bomb!  This restaurant is head and shoulders above rest.  Delicious, healthy, and amazing staff.  This meal, and the employee here who helped me, really made my day."}
{"text":"Just ordered the lemon records pancakes, the two young ladies up the front,  we're very sweet and had great customer service. .."}
{"text":"A very nice local bakery and eatery. Breakfast is limited but all good. Lots of sandwiches and other choices. Really nice folks and top quality friendly service."}
{"text":"You can see by my reviews I am a fan of wildflower.  I stopped by after a bike ride.  I tried their new three cheese frittata.  It was really good.  I did ask for no slow roasted tomatoes.  They also did not put the yummy sundried tomatoes in it.  I was  a bit bummed.  It was really good though even though the sun dried tomatoes were working.  I like frittatas a lot.  I wish they would expand their menu to include a Tortilla de Patata.  It is similar to a frittata."}
{"text":"This place seems to have changed since the young man that was in charge left.  This time was not that good. I ordered potatoes and they seem to take a excessive amount of time to get to my table.  I probably could have and should have said something.  I got them and they were cold.  I did eat them since I was pressed for time.  I mentioned it to the guy cooking and he wanted to make me something, but I had waited a bit already and needed to leave.  I did go back another time and it was similar in the morning.  I will give this place a break for a while."}
{"text":"Up in the area after a meeting and decided to stop by.  The ham and swiss sandwich was really good.  I even ordered a side cesar salad too.  I love the mushrooms in the salad.  It gives it a good flavour.  Great food once again."}
{"text":"Had a lay over in Phoenix and wanted to grab breakfast. Wildflower was just outside the gate. Ordered eggs and sausage. When my order came, it was missing the sausage. They quickly fixed my order. The food was fresh and very good. The staff are awesome. We'll make sure to stop by on my way back."}
{"text":"Pretty ridiculous not to serve pasta during lunch time! Went to Panera instead. Way better service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Ordered a coffee and a Taylor ham and egg.  The Blueberry scone was wonderful. I will go back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"I had a chicken & pesto sandwich that was absolutely delicious.  It had rosated red peppers and sauteed mushrooms.  It was truly satisfying for lunch.

It was hard to decide on what to have as the menu has a lot to choose from.  It does get very busy at lunch-time during the week, seating can be a challenge.  The staff is very friendly and polite.  Noise level is in the mid to high range but nothiing annoying.

I recommend giiving it a try if you are in the mood for a soup or salad offers more than standard ingredients."}
{"text":"We live basically across the street and finally decided to come in and try Wildflower for breakfast. We didn't know how it worked when we walked in but a nice gentleman who worked there gave us the instructions to order, get our 'flag' and drinks and find a table and our order would be brought out to us.

I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were about as perfect as you could get. Just enough lemon and the ricotta makes them moist and a great texture. They come with butter, syrup and a blueberry compote. I tried one bite with the blueberry compote which is great but I thought they were perfect with just the syrup. I also got a side of sausage which was awesome - fat links with great flavor and a bit of rosemary.

My better half ordered an egg, bacon and potatoes dish and all was tasty as well. The sourdough toast was great (as it should be for a bread company). 

The service was really nice - several check in's asking if we needed more water or syrup and if all was well. 

Definitely want to go back for some of their sandwiches - the menu looks yummy and after that breakfast we will go back to try more!"}
{"text":"If you like interesting and innovative soups, salads, sandwiches this is the place. Fresh and healthy choices with daily and seasonal specials. The handcrafted artisan bread to-go is fantastic - 9 grain was my choice today. Staff was friendly and service was quick.  A welcome change to traditional drab & predictable sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with the following: I realized ordering fish might be a risk at an establishment such as this, but the girl at the counter was raving about it so i thought i would give it a try. ~What a mistake!~ I took my meal to go, or I would have 100% talked to a manager about this experience.

The service was semi-friendly, it was late lunch time and they were busy but not crazy busy. I opted for the Salmon Caesar Salad (recommendation from the employee.) The salad consisted romaine lettuce (which was not \"crispy\" like noted on the menu,) capers, grated parmesan cheese, croutons (soggy) and caesar dressing (dressing was a decent flavor.) On top of the salad was the \"Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet\" which was super dry, had absolutely no seasoning and had a mild hint of freezer burn taste. It clearly was an older piece of fish that had been in the freezer for far to long. It was totally my fault for expecting far better but they definitely should have tossed that chunk of meat out long ago. On the brighter side, the bread served with the salad was really good & the iced tea was enjoyable too. 

Safe to say, stick to the bakery items (sandwiches & baked goods.) Definitely DO NOT ORDER THE \"Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet Caesar Salad.\" Yuck!"}
{"text":"Anthony the manager provides unparalleled service. He made our whole night with his positive and inviting attitude. This restaurant and specifically this location has exceptional service. My roommates and I eat here at least once a week. It has such a homey vibe that we love so much."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Wildflower is good stuff, but I have to say when it comes to fancy sandwich places I think Paradise Bakery does it better.  We're lucky to have both in abundance in our little burg.

My usual sandwich orders are the turkey and brie and the roast beef and gorgonzola - with the latter being my favorite.  I'm not a fan of the tomato bread salad that comes with each sandwich though.  It seems like they don't know what else to do with left-over bread so they concoct some kind of soggy salad out of old bread to use as fillers for the sandwich dishes.  NOT a fan.  The pasta is pretty good.  I usually get the pesto linguini with chicken, and always end taking left-overs home.

If you're there early enough, their breakfast ain't bad either.  The ham, egg and swiss sandwich is decent and comes on a tasty ciabatta roll. 
If you fly solo - no fear- you've got the newspaper-filled round table to sit, veg out and read.

Isolated incident.  But once when we were eating out on the patio we got solicited by a drunk hobo who was on the verge of passing out.  Gosh.  He could have at least shared his liquor...."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this particular Wildflower for well over a year now and it is one of our favorite, if not our favorite, places for breakfast and lunch.  The food, breads and pastries are second to none, the consistency is excellent and their menu has many selections to choose from.  On top of this, everyone working there is extremely friendly and helpful.  They always greet you with a smile and appear to be enjoying themselves.  Unfortunately, one of  their newer  employees doesn't seem to be enjoying herself as much as everyone else.  She happens to work the register and is the first person, and impression, that the customer is given.  She always appears to be unhappy, disinterested and overall, rather grumpy.  We hate to see one employee ruin or tarnish the good experience everyone else brings to the company.  We would hope that bringing this to your attention will help rectify the situation.  
Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Good quality food, big portions, friendly staff, and fast service.  This place blows panera/paradise out of the water."}
{"text":"Love coming here, they are always good and speedy. 

I usually get their Wild Flower Two combo. Their salads are always fresh too!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a few times a week. You can't beat $5.40 for a bowl of soup and bread. The food is always promptly delivered. The one time it wasn't, management offered me a giftcard for the extra long wait. Top notch service."}
{"text":"3 of us went into the store yesterday for breakfast and it was a really great experience that I want to tell you about:

Everybody in this group has gone through a life-changing event recently, which involved some discussion.  We got breakfast, did the requisite catch up, then hunkered down to talk about the big stuff.

We ended up being there for 2 meals!!!!  Everyone was relaxed and enjoying their meal...I don't know about you but I don't often see that in restaurants anymore.

Our first meal was the traditional breakfast stuff....I treated myself to the carrot cake muffin and coffee which was just right.

I had the grilled cheese for lunch and it was just fabulous!  We all tried the berry pie and it is a winner...perfect texture, crust, and amount of sweetness.

During the entire visit, we didn't get any nasty looks for our extended stay...I really appreciate this because my friends are hurting and a quick meal would not have been the best remedy for their situation.  I teach Emotional Intelligence and Empathy and was pleased to see that the  team definitely demonstrates these traits.

I have a very short list of \"5 Star\" joints and this place is on it.

Just one suggestion though, it would be great to have cold brewed coffee available for refills :)"}
{"text":"I typically go to the Scottsdale location but tried this one today. I took my family after raving about this place since it opened. We waited 40 minutes for our food and only received it after we checked on it and saw it sitting on the back counter. At that point we asked them to pack it to go. Once getting in the car to leave we checked the order and were missing a few items. Then we decided to see if the food was even warm, it was not. Which makes me think it had been ready for some time but no one brought it out. I was hoping to say scratch the order and just give me my money back, but I was never given a receipt. Now we wait even longer to see what can be done... 

Extremely disappointed and don't know that I'll even go to the Scottsdale location anymore."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. The service is impeccable, the food is great and always fresh and the bread...mmmmm the bread, so good.  The best around.

The service is good, people are nice especially considering this place is a zoo 24/7.  There is always a smile on their face and always happy to accommodate, which is hard to come by nowadays."}

{"text":"My ideal day is coming to Wildflower, ordering a chopped salad and then spending hours browsing books next door at Changing Hands. I just love this salad it is one of my favorites. The salad is comprised of chopped arugula, Israeli cous cous, freeze dried corn, dried cranberries, red bell pepper, feta, sunflower seeds and salmon. It is perfection! My only regret is that I am not able to visit more often."}
{"text":"Great place! My favorite dish is chicken pesto & feta sandwich, so good! They have good service really enjoy coming. The strawberry spinach salad and the Caesar salad are really good as well would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say I got excited to see one pop up by my work yay. Love the one by 101 and Beardsley. Will be checking this one out hadn't been in forever hoping they have the mix grill and wiildflower salad with the peach smoothie love it."}
{"text":"Love the Chopped salad with the salmon, Israeli couscous, and dried corn!!  Everything is  consistently good!"}
{"text":"I'd been the Sedona location twice and absolutely loved it. There, it was super busy and we got our food really fast. We loved it so much, we stopped off at this location on the way back home.  While the food is still just as good, they goofed on my order, and it took awhile to bring it all out despite not nearly being as crowded as the Sedona location. But overall, a really good sandwich chain that I wish would come to the LA area."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Super fresh bread, meat, ingredients. I get the roast beef sandwich on wheat. Roasted peppers is a nice touch. Incredible lemonade and iced tea (make an Arnold Palmer). Ive been to Sedona and other Phx locations, which were great too."}
{"text":"Fast service! Good healthy options. Always fresh food."}

{"text":"First time eating at Wildflower. Went out to breakfast earlier this week with a friend. Great experience! Delicious meal! Got the lemon ricotta pancakes and 2 sunny side up eggs. Yummy! Love the berry topping. Cashier was super helpful in helping decide on that since I wanted everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Good food.

Had BLT Plus on Sourdough. Pretty Good. Sandwiches are served a mix of potato and sweet potato chips lightly salted. Washed that all down with a Blackberry Orange Lemonde -awesome lemonade!

This place reminds me of Corner Bakery. Same quality food. Decor is very cool, glass wildflowers on ceiling.

Went around lunchtime and was very busy. Had a hard time finding seating inside."}
{"text":"This place just gets it right with quality. Our Staff at New Serenity Spa is so grateful to have this awesome restaurant  right next door.  We refer our out of town guests because we believe in the quality and service.   The soups, sandwiches and pastries are amazing.  I also discovered  that this branch gives left overs to homeless shelters at the end of the evening.  Great food and a lot of heart!  Thank you Wildflower! :)"}
{"text":"Today was my first day ever coming here .  I ordered a sausage and cheddar breakfast sandwich to go. The guy I ordered from said 10-15 min which I was fine with. They were super busy and the guy working the food counter was so productive getting other people's food out, he was so efficient! My food took a little longer than expected and out of no where gave me a gift card for my wait!  Plus the sandwich was so delicious! Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter with the septum ring was a total asshole for no reason. Very unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

A lot of people proclaim this place to be the best. I, however, think not. I had an amazing turkey sandwich here once. Worthy of five stars and the praises of a million angels. The second, third, eighth, eleventh time I've been here though...those angels had gotten their wings clipped. 

The food at Wildflower is a hit or miss for me. Sometimes the bread is fantastic, but the rest of the sandwich isn't. Other times, it's the other way around. Very seldom do they do the perfect sammy dance together and that is just so unfortunate. Sitting right next to a cool independent bookstore in a plaza that boasts a Trader Joe's and an indie record store, you'd think that Wildflower would be the place to be. Instead, it's often crowded with bitchy,entitled suburban moms (who surprisingly have zero manners) and is staffed with young space cases who get orders mixed up. 

The world would be a much better place if the folks at Duck and Decanter just used Wildflower Bread and got rid of all the nonsense."}
{"text":"Disorganized mess.  7 people behind counter no one helping customers.  This is the second time in 3 weeks I have had this experience.  Not to mention the slightly stale pastries.

Ask for small, get a tall, terrible service and expensive."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, and this place hit the spot. Nice clean restaurant, moderately busy, but almost zero wait to place an order and take a seat. I had a turkey and brie sandwich with the mixed sweet potato and regular chips. Sandwich was pretty decent. Not a ton of brie, but it worked, and the sweet peppers and turkey were nice. Wish the bread had been toasted, or a little more substantial, especially since bread is right in their name, but it didn't taste bad, it was just a little limp. The chips were great, especially the sweet potato chips.

I won't fault the place, it's a nice sandwich shop. It won't be the best or greatest sandwich you ever have, but it's good food, served up pretty quick, and the prices are pretty fair."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that this place is excellent, first of all! I hadn't had it before and our server, Brandon, was very helpful all the way around. I wasn't sure what to get so asked him what he would suggest and he said I should try the Ravioli. So, I had ordered that with meatballs and it was delicious!! He came back to the table several times making sure everything was satisfactory. He was an excellent server and Wildflower is an excellent establishment! My family and I will most definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Lots of options here which I love. Had the egg frittata and loved the eggplant in it. My husband got the egg breakfast but they over-cooked his eggs. Still good, solid food, however and definitely reminded me of Panera. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Delicious as always!  I love their fresh baked breads!  The potato cream cheese soup is amazing!  Especially in a bread bowl.  I haven't had a sandwich I didn't likes.  The place is always clean and organized.  staff is polite and helpful.  I haven't had a bad experience and I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Always love their cream cheese potato soup.  The bread bowls are really good too.  Nice staff and the food is made fresh."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and pleasant atmosphere.  The chopped salad with salmon with pesto vinaigrette was delicious.  I am from out of town and I always make it a point to stop here right off the plane.  You can't get better or fresher food anywhere.  Don't miss the Wildflower.  Superb staff too, Gary especially.  Makes you feel right at home.  Oh, did I mention the pretzels?  Out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and healthy meal! If youre looking for a quick bite that's healthy I'd recommend this place. Worth what you pay for! Their breads are made fresh along with the other ingredients!"}
{"text":"Tried this location again during lunch hour, food and service still good, but people are saving tables while they are in line, putting something on table first or a member of the party sits in booth...shouldn't the rules apply to everyone? Get in line, order and then find a table..why do some people feel they are so special?"}
{"text":"Always a great experience when we come here, breakfast or lunch, definetley a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and coffee attached to a bookstore. Wildflower, will you marry me? This place is consistently the best breakfast around. Try the two-egg with rosemary-crusted hash browns and fresh-baked toast, but add a short-stack of traditional pancakes. They're the best in town! Lunch is great too with tons of fresh sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from. The green corn chowder and french onion soups are a must. This place is small. If you're headed out on a weekend morning and afraid of crowds try the Chandler Mall location, equally as crowded but much larger. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"This is a bakery and a restaurant.

I'm just reviewing the bakery part, which I visited on two consecutive mornings.

There is a self-serve area with various breads as well as bagels. The free bread sample I tried, with the whipped butter provided was very good. The bagels on both days were large, tasted good and freshly made. 

Also, there are bakery items behind the glass counter. On both days I chose the cranberry scone, which was of the round, layered variety, which some might argue is not a traditional scone, but it was good, nonetheless.

Service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and delicious.  Vegetarian options such as the sweet red pepper soup and the wildflower salad are simply delicious!  The crusty sourdough bread is a real treat."}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast. Fair prices and good food. Alex Jackson was so gracious with clearing a table for us and getting fresh coffee made. Great place and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness all the way! Portobello picnic was very savory with the arugula, roasted tomatoes and zucchini, and ricotta cheese, and the cinnamon French toast was sweet and wholesome with melted butter and warm syrup on top. 
It was a bit crowded with tables so close. 
Then, I saw a guy just put his whole hand in the bread bites and made it kinda nasty especially when there was tongs available to pick up the bread. Yuck! Makes you wonder how many others did the same."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for lunch and we stopped by! I must give this place major KUDUS for their staff --EVERYONE was extremely friendly and it was very nice to see them smiling looking like they actually enjoyed their job!!  

Another cute bonus were the little hand lotions in the bathroom, for FREE where do you ever see that???

Ok back to the food! Shared the turkey and Bree sandwich with potato cream cheese soup! It was tasty lots of flavor and was enough for two to split! Iots of seating inside and out and don't forget a sweet treat ( we got the brownie and choco chip cookie) to go :)"}
{"text":"Super food choices - amazingly polite and efficient service. I had yummy perfectly cooked butternut ravioli which came with good quality garlic bread. Thanks to Jennifer for clearing with a smile. She knew history of the business even tho this is store 17. Don't know how management motivates these folks especially at a busy impersonal airport eatery. Kudos to all. Shows it can be done!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love wildflower bread Company's atmosphere! They have amazing food and a great wait staff. Fast service, delicious desserts, and of course the best homemade bread."}
{"text":"I visited wildflower in Sedona a few weeks ago and was at Glendale AZ location yesterday. Very good food, fast service we had soup and sandwich and a salad. Both were fresh tasty and good sized portions. Bread is great. Lemon wedding soup was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy. Wildflower is a better version of Paradise Bakery. Sunny and pretty on the inside, with very friendly staff. You can find me here for lemon-blueberry ricotta pancakes after my Sunday morning hikes"}
{"text":"Giving this WBC locations five stars bc of the new manager. He's friendly, hard working, and cares (truly cares) about catering to customers. I've seen this new manager work his way up from being a cashier and the only thing that's changed about him is his title. He's still got the same customer- first attitude. And that's what you want in a restaurant. I'm excited to see him grow and make this location even better!"}
{"text":"Great eatery for breakfast, lunch or dinner. There is good variety on menu and ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the club sandwich and I am always satisfied. They also have fresh brewed ice tea which is amazing and cinnamon rolls the size of your head. Everything is fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"My wife had the tuna sandwich and I had a roast beef sandwich.  They both tasted awful.  They go out of their way to be distinctive with different ingredients but we prefer the basic sandwiches and didn't care for these at all.  Left without eating most of them."}
{"text":"I am \"Super Fan\" of this place! I am a Flight Attendant and it gets old eating the same foods at airports. Well never at Wildflower! I look fwd to any flights that take me thru Phoenix. Because I know where I am going to be dining! I have told several fellow FAs about this Awesome place  and they are now hooked too! I tell anyone looking for Good, Fresh and Amazing food to go to Wildflower! I am laying over in Phoenix this week. Wildflower chopped salad (and a chocolate Pumpkin muffin) here I come!!!!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed coming here since I was little! I always enjoy the free samples! We came here and ordered the potato cream cheese and green Chile pork soup. It took quite a while for our food to come and like 30 minutes later they come out and tell us the green chile pork soup is unavailable so we ask for our money back for the cost of the green Chile pork soup since we will not be getting it and they told us instead they would give us more bread... So we had too much bread cause we already had ordered bread and plus our soup already came with some, so I think next time I'll just get my money back. The food was good we had to share one soup for 4 people though.."}
{"text":"First timer here and it's really good!  Here are the things we tried and a short comment:

Potato soup.  Very good. Thicker which is better. 4 stars.

BLT was good but had cheddar cheese on it??? That's just weird.  It was a 3 star.

Pumpkin soup.  5 stars!  Nothing else to say.

Chicken Parmesan sandwich.  Served open face and pretty good.  Probably a 3.75 stars sandwich.  Needs more seasoning in the sauce.

Will we be back?  Yes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Good selection of meal choices.  Had the chopped salad with chicken today, it was absolutely delicious and the Multigrain bread that came with it was out of this world.  Staff was friendly and eager to help."}
{"text":"Pretty good choice.  The salads and the sandwiches are good.  I especially appreciate that they don't soak the salads in dressing.  There are good options for the kids and they always give us an extra cookie even though we spit the kids meals.  The service at the counter isn't very good; if you have questions they aren't very good at answering them.  However the service in the lobby is excellent!"}
{"text":"Very good spot fast easy good sandwiches and soup and good plugs I liked a lot newer side with good customer service. The cashiers are awesome so nice!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best food around town. I eat here about 2 times a week and they never fail to disappoint. The chopped salad is so delicious and you can't beat the iced tea. 

If you haven't been, you need to check it out :)"}
{"text":"Great food/service.  Sarah and Stefaney (sp?) were very polite and the food was great as usual."}
{"text":"Always struggle with great places like Wildflower Bread Company that has multiple locations. I love them all.

I've been a fan of WBC since they first opened, and tried many of their spots around the state. I'm partial to their soups and cookies.

One suggestion I have - take home a loaf of bread!  It's amazing how few people I see really buy a loaf of this tasty, fresh stuff to take home.  Get your wonderful meal, but get a bread to go!"}
{"text":"They just killed the Salmon Frittata and the Chipotle Breakfast sandwich. I'm going to just sit here and cry!

;)"}
{"text":"Catering. Best Catering Manager Ever!  Michelle has pulled me outta the fire on so many occassions, the food is fresh, presentation is amazing and the guests/customers love the selections they offer.  Thank you Michelle for amazing customer service.  I would highly recommend to anyone needing a change to the average lunch catering of sandwiches.  They always season it up a little bit and make you the hero."}
{"text":"Everyone is so sweet and helpful! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Kale Chicken Salad and the Chop Salad. Im sure everything else is delicious also! They have customer for life!"}
{"text":"Every time without fail I'm completely satisfied. Whether it's breakfast.. Stuffed French toast amazing, Veggie frittata, Banana Pancakes, Lemon Pancakes, Chocolate Chip Scone, or lunch Kale Salad, Pomegranate Salad,  Chopped Salad, Oh My!!! The Staff is always sooo sweet! Terrific customer service!! Going to miss this place when I move, but will definitely be back to visit! The only thing that was a downfall was seating.. you have to look like a hawk! But its only because this place is so fabulous and they need to be HUGGGEEEE to seat all their happy returning customers! :) 
P.s. Try the wildflower cappuccino.. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these closer to home. Good food, coffee and great service. Will def. return during my next trip to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ignore the word \"bread\" in the restaurant name, and order a salad: they're actually really good! The chopped salad or their seasonal kale-quinoa are both solid, with a good size and plenty of toppings for various flavors and textures. The pesto vinaigrette dressing was great, would buy by the bottle. At around ~$10 (with a protein), it's not a bad deal for a healthy airport meal. 

Line moves fast, salads and sandwiches are pre-made and boxed up. Not sure if they'll make a dish fresh if you have special requests or dietary restrictions. Lots of seating and outlets to charge up your devices while you munch."}
{"text":"I don't usually like chain restaurants so much, except Pita Jungle, but I love Wildflower. My favs: Chopped salad, spinach chicken salad, sweet potato sandwich, mushroom soup, creamy potato soup in a bread bowl. Oh, and that seasonal roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes on it. SO good."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever!

I was on my lunch brake; therefore, I didn't have 3 hours to spare....

Not only that i waited for a cup of soup and salad for a while - it was inposiblle to find a seat. It was really frustrating. 

On top of it all, service was not good either. Our cashier  was on the phone while we were waiting to place our order. What happened to days where customer that makes a drive has a priority over somebody on the phone. 

The place is very crowded. After we finally got a seat, I felt other customers were seating at my table. You really got no privacy/space at this place unless you are lucky to grab a boot. 

Unfortunately, it was a bad experience for me and I do not think, I will be going back anytime soon........"}
{"text":"I am a \"raving fan\" when it comes to Wildflower! My favorite sandwich is the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola. I also LOVE the Morning Glory Muffins and the Chocolate Chip Scones! Every time I talk about eats in the valley, I always mention Wildflower. If you are nearby, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Since the day Wildflower opened its doors in Goodyear it has been a second home to my parents and I had to write a review for one of the managers that always goes above and beyond, Pat. She always makes everyone feel so welcomed, at home, and always greets you with a smile on a first name basis. The one quality that stands out the most for me is watching Pat interact with her employees, she always treats them with the upmost respect and as an equal. She again always greets them too with a friendly hello and that truly makes the environment of the restaurant so much happier. If there is ever a problem with our order, Pat never thinks twice about it and has it fixed immediately. She always puts the customer first and makes sure their experience is the best it can be. She also leads her Wildflower with amazing community events, she knows the importance to be a stand out citizen in representing Wildflower and its generosity. She is outstanding. This kind of customer service is what makes her stand out and it should be recognized. I hope Wildflower knows and appreciates her they way we do. She is the kind of person you would want to represent your company, she is the kind of person that you would be proud to employee, and she is the kind of person that you would want people to learn from and to lead others. Thanks for all you do, Pat!"}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying, this place is AMAZING!! I have never heard of Wildflower Bread Company before, as I am not from the area. Me and my husband are in town to watch some spring training games and we were looking for places to try when this popped up. I am vegan and have trouble finding the right places to eat as my options are limited. Looking at the menu, i was very excited to go ahead and try it. When we went in, we were energetically welcomed in by a young man at the registers. I informed him of my diet choices and he helped me every step of the way to choose the right meal for me. He said i can modify any kind of salad that I wanted, and I did just that. I got the V12 Kale salad, and i was disappointed in the face that it had feta cheese on it, because I can't eat feta. I went back up to the register and told the young man about it, and without hesitating, he said \"I'm very sorry about that, I'll bring you a new one right away\". And in less than 5 mins, a new one was brought to me without feta and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I asked the young man his name and he said Brandon. I will continue going to Wildflower Bread Company the next 3 days I am here because of the amazing salads and amazing service!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort and yelped a bakery for breakfast.  Wildflower came up - it's in the shopping center directly across the street.  What a pleasant surprise.  Within walking distance, delicious food, big portions, great service.  (May was like a mother hen, making sure that everything was fine, which it was.)   Excited to hear that there is a Wildflower at our next stop, Sedona."}
{"text":"Great dinner option. I've been eating grease and carbs like a pro lately, and figured I should attempt something healthy. 

Obviously, if I go with a cauliflower \"steak,\" that's healthy, right? I'm a pretty big fan of cauliflower when done properly. This \"steak\" was done somewhat properly... but lacked any excitement. Good thing it comes on a bed of gooey quinoa something-or-other, so that it picks up the strange savory/cranberry flavors. I then ruined everything by realizing that eating a chunk of cauliflower doesn't really accomplish much in the way of satiation, so I got a cup o' vegetable beef soup to the side. That was decent, too, though a bit on the salty side. All was redeemed by two massive chunks of delicious bread, with which I enthusiastically negated all attempts at a healthy dinner.

On a side note, the music playing during my visit was halfway to recreating my favorite \"wallowing in melancholy\" playlist, so major props to whomever was selecting the music that day."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Bread bowls and salads and cupcakes oh my! You can always find a seat here. It's clean, reliable and delicious. The best alternative for healthy, affordable food in the area! They have really good bread you can slice and take home. I mean really good. Even for a bread enthusiast like me! Great place to eat for all ages, 0-100. There is ample parking for all and it's in a nice area. Not too crowded traffic wise, even though it's right next to Arrowhead mall. Go here!"}
{"text":"Love Wildflower.  I had the sweet potato sandwich--it was delish!  I have never had a bad meal at this Wildflower location.  They also have free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Well I have been to this place several times in the past.  The past is where my visits will stay.   Visited one last time, got sick and the portion size has gone from too much food to a 3 forkful amount of sides.  Too bad for Changing Hands Book Store- hope their business keeps up in spite of the bad food being served next door."}
{"text":"They have some great sandwiches and bread! I stopped in here for lunch and left very happy after a tasty Reuben and a loaf of fresh bread to bring home"}
{"text":"5 stars for Lauren! Great at her job and she is cheerful, courteous and sharp, too.  Lauren is the cashier at the Seville/Scottsdale Wildflower Bread Co that we visit about three times a month.  She remembers us, our order and takes care of us so-o-o well.  She gets the order right each time and is very professional, too.  Kudos to you, Ms. Lauren."}
{"text":"Today will be the last time I ever eat here. The last 3 times I've come here I have gotten screwed over my order with either missing items or a very cold sandwich that was intended to be \"hot.\" Today I got the pesto chicken sandwich that tasted and looked like it was made by a 5 year old. My girlfriend got a half BLT and cup of soup-- the half sandwich was the tiniest thing I have ever seen. My 110 pound gf literally finished it in 3 bites. I'm done making excuses for this place just because it's somewhat healthy and close to my house. Don't waste your money... Go to Panera instead."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the staff was great. Stephanie, the lady who took my order, was a delight."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We just had lunch and the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. We purchased the load of bread of the month because it was so good! You can definitely tell that they use quality ingredients.  Would recommend this place to everyone. Wish I didn't live so far away so I could come here more often."}
{"text":"Went there for opening week (Friends for Life fundraiser) and really enjoyed it. Staff is very nice and food was good. Went back today and had two issues... I'm sure they're just growing pains of a new restaurant. I'll return soon and update  .. still like the place.

First issue was my wife's Caesar salad... Kinda drenched with dressing. I'm sure they would have fixed it if she'd asked but she just shook it off and soldiered on.

The second issue is a bit more of a problem. I bought a couple of dessert items but after I paid I noticed flies all over them. I thought maybe those were display items but they weren't. We just threw 'em away. Again, service is great there and I'm sure they would have refunded if I'd asked but the line was long so we just chucked them.

Our sandwiches were great though. :)

Update: Replied via email. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled being married to an Italian.  When I order food, I expect it to be abundant - or at least visible.  I ordered the asian chicken salad.  Where's the chicken?  I had to hunt high and low for it and let me tell you, I think there was an equivalent of one chicken nugget!  When I mentioned this to the manager, he said \"oh, we weigh everything\".  Huh.  They should check their scales.

Companion had a sandwich and the bread was stale.  Oh wait, isn't this a BREAD company?

Not to mention the passion fruit tea tasted like, well, nothing.  No passion about it.

Shame on us for trying a chain restaurant.  I'll stick to the independents that actually serve food.

UPDATE:  I am changing my review due to the immediate response of the owner and management.  They responded within an hour and took my review with genuine concern.  They assured me that what I experienced was not normal and they have spoken to their staff.  Based on this, and friends assurances that this is a great place, I will try it again and hope it was a one-time thing.

UPDATE 2:  Went back to 2 stars since management didn't follow through as stated."}
{"text":"Was a little bit of a mad rush at lunch, but we found a booth in the corner. My arugula chicken salad was amazing and my friends vegetable soup had nice flavor."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is amazing! Supremely friendly! The food was also amazing. We loved the sea salt and hazelnut cookies. Highly recommend when you're at the airport that you stop by. It meant a lot and made our wait at the airport much better."}
{"text":"I went to wildflower for breakfast this morning a little before 9 AM. When I got there they were out of coffee. I inform a staff member that they were out of decaf. She said OK. 20 minutes later they still had no coffee of any kind. When our food was served I asked  the server that if they would have decaf soon. She said they didn't have any decaf today and asked me if I'd like a refund on my coffee. I said yes it never saw her again.

The food at wildflower for breakfast is marginal at best. The potatoes are mushy and my frittata was barely warm. I asked the server for Cholula  sauce and she said she would get some but never came back to the table."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to grab a quick, reasonably priced breakfast. While your taste buds won't be blown away- there's something to be said for consistency and classic breakfast staples. 

Easy parking, plenty of room inside- blah blah blah- it's nice."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good here but the wait is always atrocious, and not just because they are busy. Every time I come in employees are scattered around seemingly doing nothing or just talking to each other. I decided I would try calling my order in ahead to see if I could skip the wait a bit. Over 30 mins after my order was called in it still was not ready, I will not be coming back here. Fair warning if you decide to eat here be prepared to wait 30+ mins for your meal as management can't seem to get employees to focus on orders."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast as we wanted more than at the Comfort Inn usual fare.     Wife had Cinnamon Raisin Nut French Toast.   I had the Corned Beef scramble with potatoes and Rye two toned  toast.    The orange juice was fresh squeezed and the coffee very flavorable.     Never heard of Wildflower Bread Co. but figured it is an AZ version of Panera.    Very good and tasty.    Quick service and the place  was stylish and clean."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place rocks...Think Panera on steroids and you've got a good idea of what to expect at Wildflower!

I came here and ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, and was shocked at how two seemingly odd flavors combined together so beautifully.  The blueberry compote was the cherry (or I guess blueberry) on top, and the perfect finish to these deliciously fluffy creations!  Service was with a smile, despite my drooling while looking their menu up and down...

Next time I'm back in AZ, I'll surely be returning for their appetizing lunch soups/sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, Wildflower never disappoints. This is my comfort food. Between the seasonal menu items and the regular menu, everything is always amazing. The chopped salad and cranberry scone are my everything."}
{"text":"Siri recommended this place to us when we were visiting Peoria!! It's easily accessible and in the mall. Very clean and nice and they have glass art by \"new glass company\". It's a chain but is family owned. Really cute dishes and mugs. The guy behind the counter was super awesome and accommodating with our complicated order! The chocolate croissant is amazing and so are their breads. Love that they have samples set out! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I'm surprised as to how good the food is.  I ordered the Asian chicken salad and was nicely surprised.  Service was also quick."}
{"text":"Had breakfast recently.  Ordered the chipotle egg sandwich and my wife had stuffed french toast.  It's another order at the front and have a seat fast food type place.  The price was average and the service was too.

A few minutes later our food came out.   The sandwich was good but not noteworthy.  My wife said the same about her french toast.  

I wouldn't hesitate to come back if I was in the area but don't have any strong recommendation for anyone to go out and seek this as the best breakfast out there by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"While I am not in love with Wildflower, I do have to mention the great service we had recently. We have food allergies, so we are \"those people\" when we place an order. CarolAnne was very patient and friendly with us AND she got our order entered correctly on the first try! It sounds funny but that doesn't happen very often. We told the manager how sweet she was and she was happy to hear that as this is CarolAnn's first job. Keep up the friendly service CarolAnne! I also noticed new management at this location, which was much needed."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Breakfast and lunch are equally good. My absolute favorite is the BLT. The best part is the avocado spread and the toasted sourdough. 

The downside is the noise. It's loud like a school cafeteria. Upside is good food and strong free wifi."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Was there when they first opened this morning  for takeout. Excellent staff. Wide awake with smiles. Food was fantastic! Would recommend this place to everyone. Super clean and food is super fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Wildflower since this location first opened. Love the food! Well most of it at least. Some items on the menu switch due to the season. Which I like. However; there is one employee who I can not say the same about. Michelle!!!! She makes my experience going to wildflower hell. So rude and always has a nasty attitude. One time when I went I was clearly in line waiting my turn and she helped a guy who walked in after me even though I had already been waiting in line. She didn't even acknowledge me. When I told the manager she ignored me and went into the kitchen. Really? I ended up leaving and never wanting to come back. If it wasn't because I enjoy their food so much I probably wouldn't! Never fails that when I go and that employee happens to be there I always get the same nasty attitude from her. One time she was even bribing customers to give her a good review for a contest they had. She would give them free items in return for a good review. Even some employees mentioned to me what she was doing. Oh and guess what? She won the contest! I can name three other employees who are always happy to help and treat me with respect who actually deserved to win. I don't know how she's managed to have her job for so long. She is the reason why I gave this place three stars."}
{"text":"Today we stopped by Wildflower for breakfast. We were so disappointed in our visit. We have been coming here for years and have always been happy with our meal. My husband requested his potatoes be prepared \"crispy\".  The potatoes were cremated. I can't imagine how the cook, waiter or Manager let these potatoes be served. When the waiter brought the breakfast to our table, he was laughing, put the plate in front of my husband and started to walk away. We sent the potatoes back but the jokes on them. ...We and our friends will not be going back. There just are too many great choices in the area to be treated so poorly."}
{"text":"Cross between Panera and a diner. Good variety large but it did not feel as healthy as Panera. Noisy. Did not feel cozy, rather cafeteria like. Taste was ok but not special   Overall bland experience."}
{"text":"Visited on vacation and found the pancakes rubbery and even tough to  cut! Disappointed! Coffee not  great either.  I'm sticking to Panara!
!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun and cute! Like a more fun alternative to Panera. I had the tuna sandwich (my lunch go-to) and it was fantastic. I hesitate to order sandwiches sometimes when I feel like I could make the same thing at home but this was so not the case. It had amazing bread and came loaded with a ton of fresh veggies and a side of potato salad. 

All of the staff was exceptionally kind and made sure I had everything I needed. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Like this place very much except for their uncomfortable seats (including the booths). The food is great. Unfortunately they did eliminate my favorite from the menu. I am a vegetarian and there are several choices that are excellent for me. The price is right too. I recommend it."}
{"text":"First time customers and we must say, other than the red hair lady needing an attitude adjustment at the register (that initially made it a bad first  impression) service from the other staff mixed with the AWESOME food changed our visit from bad to good to great real fast!!! We'll def be back.... But will avoid one particular cashier!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, everyone (almost) is super nice! We are there at least 4 times a week. My kids order the same thing and I try different items all the time! Potato soup is the best! My son is one to run around and jump everywhere (very hyper one!) and never has anyone told him he is disrupting! Very family/kid friendly place! I come here to work on my laptop once in a while and really enjoy the atmosphere! Will continue to bring my kids!"}
{"text":"I tried something new today again! I had the Asian chicken salad. It was so good! Everything has so much flavor and a variety of textures! I will probably get the Asian chicken salad every time! 

Again, I ordered potato cream cheese soup. It was kind of flavorless, unfortunately."}
{"text":"tried wildflower for the very first time. I was impressed with the young man whom checked us out. His name was Brandon. He answered and explained everything very well. The food was very good, in fact there was enough I took home and had the next day. Fast service and someone was always cleaning up the facility.  It's hard in these days to find such a dedicated people whom care.  I was in the medical field for years and I know when people like what they are doing verses people who are just there. Embrace this young man for teaching him all he needs plus more and he will be excellent at what ever he does in life. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok went to chandler mall and decided to grab a bit to eat during lunch time. They where busy, but  I expected it to be. But the service was fast and we had a very friendly server. Loved my lunch, a bit pricey but with that being said I  would pay for good food."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  The soup is good, but you can't mess up in soup.  My sandwich was poorly thrown together. Very disappointed in the fact I paid a good amount of money for such a crappy meal. Won't be coming back, I do not u destiny how this place is so busy. I seen Flys landing on the bagels.  Eww."}
{"text":"I will continue to come here because the staff is always so sweet! I typically order via pick up, and this past Sunday I accidentally ordered the wrong size soup, but their staff fixed my mistakes without making me feel stupid and they continued to show kindness and friendliness. I will continue to eat here because of them. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"First and last time here. Location makes all the difference! The Wildflower across the street from McCormick Railroad Park has never messed up my order! This location was a disaster. Not only did they majorly mess up my order, I got my order to go, so I did not realize my order was wrong until after I drove all the way home and opened my bag. To start, this place asks for your name when you order, So they messed up my name and were calling out someone else's name for about 10 minutes before they realized it was my order. So there was a long wait, no where to sit, and because they did not make my order correctly, I basically had to throw it out. I was charged extra for things I did not receive, so I am mad about that. I will never go back there. I will stick with the Wildflower Bread Company by the railroad park."}
{"text":"All I have to say is OMG ! We happened to go to this place while in Scottsdale while driving around and it is soooo amazing ! It's like Panera Bread but way better ! Great healthy options with fresh ingredients and I can't wait to go back !!!! This is a must if you are looking for healthy but delicious options! Yummy .."}
{"text":"We eat here every week. The food is fresh and they have a lot of variety. I love their breakfast and lunch and one of these days I will try the pasta!"}
{"text":"I decided to try something new today: Spring vegetable quinoa salad. I didn't like it. It tasted old. It was nothing special. I didn't finish even half of it.

Thank goodness I got the potato cream cheese soup which was good as always!"}
{"text":"Love, love Wildflower!  Great service, delicious fresh food, clean and bright spaces!  Locally-owned and community-minded!  My only frustration is you can't find a spot to park during the lunch rush as it's so popular!"}
{"text":"Breakfast foods here are pretty good, but lunch is much better. The roast beef sandwich is good. Soups aren't to bad either."}
{"text":"I love this place it has so many good options. Healthy and good portions. You can have a decent lunch or dinner and feel good about yourself. I love the free bread and butter they have they keep changing the bread so you get to try many options. And it is so close to my house ! Love it !!"}
{"text":"Was passing through looking for a good gluten free option. This place was delicious with lots of options!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to wildflower for a while now. I have been to many of their locations. This location has been my best experience with them thus far. I just ordered their breakfast \"egg breakfast\" over medium and wow! They actually cooked the eggs correctly! I love when you get what you order. Yum!

I would definitely recommend!

I own a family operated appliance repair company here in the valley that can also be found on Yelp.

{"text":"Fast, friendly, tasty, healthy, clean, excellent value. What more can you ask for at a upscale fast food joint. 

I was there at the peak of lunch time, and yet staff was friendly and efficient. Food came to my table quickly, maybe 5 minutes. 

Had the turkey waldorf salad. Excellent. Bread was the way bread was meant to be (from someone who has been making bread at home for 15 years).  Good texture, crust, taste."}
{"text":"Great selection of  bakery items, sandwiches, pasta, salads and breakfast items.  Everything is tasty and fresh.  Order at the cash register station, get your drinks and they will bring your order to your table when it's ready.  Very comfortable and casual.  Has WiFi available.  We had breakfast the other morning at a table, then moved to several comfortable chairs to finish our coffee and read the newspapers that had been left there. Definitely one of our \"go to\" places in this area."}
{"text":"On a lay over. Looking for something fresh and tasty. This place jumped out at me. The food was great! Little pricy but that's ok. Worth it for airport choices. Was helped by young guy. Very helpful friendly and you can just tell he works hard. Very refreshing after getting off a plane."}
{"text":"A long time customer turned away by a horrible experience,  As frequent diner, we visit a number of local restaurants.  Wildflower is down the street and we were weekly regulars until now.  The chopped salad was ordered and due to a lack of staff, we then proceeded to bus our own table. This is not unusual.  The salad arrived with a distinct shortage of lettuce.  We asked the server to alert the manager.  Rather than solve the problem, the manager sent over another employee with a bowl of lettuce.  He made  number of comments from \"that's what you get\" to \"they were cutting the portions\" to \"your wife got your lettuce\".  REALLY!!!!  When asked if this how management was trained, he stated that he wasn't the manager.  We again asked for the manager who after a long spell told us she was busy on the phone.  Unfortunatley, we had observed the entire time and knew this was false.  The reality is she simply sent over worker who was untrained, which follows with the lack of staff to bus tables, the lack of experienced kitchen help to prepare food and the poor management.  So, if you don't mind making your own lunch, busing your own table and then paying for the privilege of doing so, Wildflower is for you.  There are better dining options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost decades. I love their soup, salads (Turkey Waldorf my fav - get the dressing on the side or they drench it)   It's packed for lunch but there is indoor and outdoor seating at the McClintock location and Chandler Mall.  I always feel good after eating here.  It's why I'm a loyal and frequent customer for almost two decades (since Chandler Mall opened)...."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the most delicious potato/cheese soup.  Ahhh... comforting, flavorful and just delicious.  A few nights later, I had the absolutely pleasure of tasting a variety of Wildflower's offerings at a Yelp Event.  The butternut squash ravioli was incredible.  I could've eaten a few platefuls of that goodness... but I had to save room for the turkey/cranberry/stuffing sandwich, which was like a little bite of Thanksgiving.  

I need to return to try the huge number of pastries and other baked goods... and work my way through the rest of the menu.  This is definitely a place that will be in my regular rotation of quick-stop spots."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but it seems like over the years the quality of workers and care for food has gone down. I recently came in with my family and we barely could squeeze ourselves in a table, but I'll take fault for that because I knew how small this location was, just seems like they have added more tables and created less room for guests. 
As for the service, no one who worked here this night seemed to look like they enjoyed being here let alone having to do any work. The male expo/busses seemed angry about having to clean, walk around guests, and just generally serve anyone. 
My sister ordered a BLT and salad which looked good until she opened the sandwich to two tiny strips of bacon lost in the giant and multiple pieces of other items. I ordered the cheese ravioli which tasted great but the portions for the price I'm paying is way off. I shouldn't be paying $10+ for barely a handful of pasta and double the sauce. 
I just really would love to see some improvement before my return to this location."}
{"text":"I paid 30 dollars for 9 ravioli's and a very small disgusting sandwich. Customer service was below average and not very helpful. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Today was our first time to try Wildflower Bread (just moved here from PA). The broccoli soup was delicious and the chicken pesto sandwich so fresh and tasty. The manager Frank was so welcoming and we appreciated him taking the time to tell us about what they offer. Loved the hazelnut chocolate chip cookies and looking forward to returning to try the pastas!"}
{"text":"This is my Sunday spot!

I always have to get their potato cream cheese soup. It is to die for! If you get it in a bread bowl, it is 853157042159 Times better! Yum! Very addicting 

I love their Tuscan kale salad, roast beef & gorgonzola sandwich, and grilled turkey pastrami sandwich. I have yet to try their pasta! 

I've also had some breakfast items. So I am a person who hates breakfast food! I hate oatmeal and pancakes and eggs! Wildflower does some justice though! They have steal cut oatmeal and pancakes that taste pretty good. I actually like them! 

If you haven't been to Wildflower Bread Company, you need to try it at least once! Unless you keep going there ;)"}
{"text":"I love it here! Great clean breakfast that are never a disappointment!!! Coffee always tastes delish and staff very professional. I do feel as if staff sometimes have a mild cold like attitude but overall they r always doing their job! Establishment is clean & cozy, definitely a keeper.

Tip: Try their pecan banana pancakes"}
{"text":"I stop in for a bagel a couple times a week. Good bagels, interesting pricing - a bagel is $1.29, cream cheese is $1.35. So you pay more to get a shmear of cream cheese than for the bagel itself. With tax a toasted bagel with cream cheese is just under $3, and they're typically pretty fast. The counter help I've encountered are always friendly. This morning they were working on a large catering order (funny thing is, I think it was for a group meeting at my office!) and I had to wait about 10 minutes before they got around to toasting mine, but most days it's no more than a minute or two."}
{"text":"Well try not to order the Butternut Squash ravioli. It is not a good dish. It basically was just frozen ravioli with a white sauce that tasted like nothing. The chicken that was added also had issues and needed to head into the oven to get better cooked. The garlic bread was the best part of this forgettable meal and the \"scotch\" cookie wasn't their best effort either."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is so fresh! I strongly recommend the chopped salad. Everyone is super nice that works here. You see an influx of elderly folks and people coming from work, but it would be a good place to eat lunch and study. Whenever I'm in Arizona I have to come here."}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times over the last five years.  Yesterday I went in
and asked for soup and a half sandwich.  (I have gotten this in the morning for years). 
A new managerish type came up to me after ordering to inform me that the standards don't require the soup to be made for two more hours.  I said I was confused as I had gotten it on a regular basis in the morning.  The employees  behind him told it was already ready.  Huh?  He then brought me a soup with a salad which I did not order.  

I finally got my regular no thanks to this abrupt annoying manager.

Other than this new manager, I have always been very happy with the good and service."}
{"text":"Meh...Not so hot!  I had a tuna sandwich with soup.  The soup, a shrimp chowder, was good.  The tuna had almost no taste and what was there was nothing to write home about.  It was bland and overflavored with some kind of herbs but it seemed to vary with each bite...Hard to describe and even harder to digest.  In fact it is still sitting there an hour later!  My partner had their 'famous' chicken salad sandwich, which seemed to suffer the same rate...No flavor at all and covered with garnishes to attempt to make up for it.  The bread, in both cases, was dry and fell apart in the process of eating it.  And, they were busy, to boot.  Go figure!"}
{"text":"This place needs a MAJOR remodel!  The seating area is just gross, benches and seats ripped and dirty.  No one to clean the tables, the night we went it was a mess!  The food was ok but if the dining area isnt clean, it makes me think the back area isnt either! Table next to me had an issue with their food and had the manager refund them.  I used to be a big fan and I do like other locations, this one needs work."}
{"text":"I came in tonight with my family. I ordered Salmon Alfredo. When the food was brought out to my table, we were greeted with a bright smile by a young man who said his name was Brandon. We kept asking for more condiments (butter for the bread, extra alfredo sauce, etc.) and he catered to our every need and kept asking if we needed anything else. The food was absolutely delicious and I will definitely keep showing up at Wildflower because of the fantastic food and service!!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the club sandwich was very yummy. The sconce was tasteless and yucky, and the chia latte was watered down."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Wildflower Bread Company! Can you tell?
Did you know they use wild Alaskan salmon in their salads,etc? 
Did you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes? 
Always very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get! 
I finally tried something a little different today: 1/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS! Every bite was pure deliciousness! 
Although I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well! 
This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I cannot understand why I haven't visited this restaurant more...it's really good!
Two of us went and both had the Double R Chopped Salad and both  agreed it was delicious! The greens were fresh, as were the veggies and meat. 
My hubby had the butternut squash soup and it was fab!
This is a great place for lunch, but if you're with a group of friends that want to talk, be forewarned: it's LOUD in here!
Still, GREAT FOOD and reasonable prices....we'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Had a spicy chipotle egg sandwich and it was awful.  The brioche roll would have been good when  fresh, but it was stale.  The spread was gross and decidedly not spicy.  Not good.

The service was ok."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp to introducing me to my favorite unique sandwich spot!

Wildflower is a cute chain, very much like panera bread, incorperating the norm with fun and funky but warm flavors.  With a great range of bread choices, different mustards and cheeses, toppings and combos and sides, its hard to not find a sandwich you will love.  

Though I've had a lot of different things here, my absolute FAVORITE sandwich in this world is the BLT plus.  Do me a favor - do the BLT plus, switch brie for cheddar, and add cucumber - and you will be sandwich heaven."}
{"text":"I have to say, Wildflower has been consistently awesome each time I've visited.  This also covers all of their locations as well.  I know that no matter which one I go to, the food is going to be delicious and the service is going to be good as well."}
{"text":"I've been known to not be adventerous with food but in the last few years I've really tried to step out of my comfort zone.  The Mixed Grill was my first out of my box experience.  It's a hot sandwich, never would have but glad I did, that consists of ham, turkey, swiss, cheddar, carmelized onions, dill pickle and honey mustard.  Holy delicious.  It's a mess but so worth it.  Make sure you bring a wet nap because it can get sticky.

My second out of box experience was with their Potato Cream Cheese soup.  I have never been a fan of \"creamy\" soups but tried this as I was urged by a coworker- I haven't been the same since.  This soup has some sort of magical power that makes me forget that I never liked creamy soups.  Again, not sure whats in it, besides the obvious, but its perfect.

In addition to the food, the customer service is good too.  I've never had a visit that I've wished I hadn't made.

Now, I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili. superfantasticdeliciousness.  i've only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didn't like.  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite.
Thanks, Louis!"}
{"text":"Horrible business model.  \"Communicating\" with customers by yelling at them is not effective.   You could probably fix that if you turned down the music to non-concert decibel.  There are NO signs telling customers where to go to order or where to go to pick up their food.  Instead , you yell at the customers.  Also - directing your customers to wait for their food in front of the cream/sugar/trash is not a good idea. Also - maybe having a manager who worked instead of standing around just jaw-open like a cave man would help. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at WBC since being in Phoenix for my trip. I've enjoyed it every time. Always friendly staff, tasty food and chill study vibes. This time I had the Mixed Grill.

Try it!"}
{"text":"Yet another 5-star experience at WBC. I asked if they sold their coffee beans, as they do at some stores. The clerk went back and asked their manager, and they promptly handed me a cup full of coffee beans on the house (though they don't officially sell them here). Their muffins are tasty as ever and the sandwich is fresh and fine. Well done. Wish they had these in Minnesota!"}
{"text":"I did return to this place after customer service offered me a giftcard for my 4 star review. The value of the card was $12, so thanks to Wildflower for the card. I noticed the Sour Cream Blueberry Muffin online, so after I got the card (about 10:30am), I also noticed they were out of that muffin. No big deal right - things sell out, but customer service tells me otherwise:
  Hi Brad,

Our standard is to be 100% in stock. I am so sorry to hear we were out of the Sour Cream Blueberry muffins! Did you speak with a Manager? Was this at the Tempe location? 

The only thing I could think of is that someone came in and ordered a very large unexpected order for a catering however that would be a guess and it is always best to go straight to the source! 

I did receive an apology, but never got an explanation about why they were out of that muffin, despite this policy. Anyway, the pumpkin/chocolate muffin was outstanding, but if that really is your policy, then get it right!. I'm not sure whether these things are baked in-store or at a central facility, but that may have been a factor.
   Tried the scones, but they are not great. Blueberry Muffin better."}
{"text":"If you need to get a little work done, go out with freinds, or want to take your kids somewhere to eat. This is the place, i have been going here for a while and i feel so comfortable Everytime, you will definitely get your money's worth here, as the portions and so big!!"}
{"text":"Overall not a bad place.

Here is what I like about Wildflower

Chopped salad- made with mixed greens, salmon, roasted red peppers, couscous, sunflower seeds and feta cheese (I'm probably forgetting a few things, but you get my point).  Accented by a pesto vinaigrette dressing.  I'm not a fan of the red peppers so I substitute with cucumbers.  For the money, fair value for a good salad.

Sweet Potato & Greens Breakfast Bowl- 2 eggs over sweet potatoes, red onions, red peppers, kale, spinach, veracha, goat cheese & toasted pepitas served with a side of toast.  Now this is a winner for under $8.00.  Again, not a fan of their red peppers so I substitute out.

Free samples of \"bread of the month\"- yes that's right, you can get a little nibble of their monthly bread offering.  Awesome when picking up your carry out.

Now what I'm not a fan off.......

Calories hidden in the food.  There's beautiful chocolate scones being offered.  One may ask, what is the worst calorie count in a scone....300?  400? okay 500 calories at worst.  NOPE!!!  810 calories of which 400 are from fat.  Really Wildflower, you can't make something a little healthier.  Just a tad?  

I can mention other one but I wont.  Okay, one more.  Their Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  Delicious for sure, but having pancakes shouldn't be 950 calories 

For a quick carry out, look at the nutrition offering and you shouldn't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Paradise had lousy service today so we just went across the street to Wildflower.  Got the BBQ Chipotle Chicken salad.  It was pretty good but I do wish they had a lighter version of the salad dressing.  I didnt realize till after I ate it of course when I looked up the nutrition info that the salad dressing had 20 grams of sugar and the whole salad with dressing was 27 grams.  While looking at nutrition info I noticed it said there was feta in the salad.  Feta?  What feta?  I called in to let them know.  Nick the manager asked me where I was located.  He was prepared to have someone bring me the feta.  Now that is some serious customer service.  I told him I scarfed salad too late and I wouldnt make you do that either.  He is replacing the salads for next visit.  :-)"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is great.  I had an issue with my breakfast (not a huge deal) and the manager, May (Mae), refunded my money with no problem.  She's great!  Super thoughtful, caring, and I kid you not, it the primary reason I will be back.

THANKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of healthy options when traveling so this place is a must for me whenever I am in Phoenix Airport which is every other week. 

Their soups always taste great and super hot. Their sandwiches are also so fresh and tastes great. 

I agree with everyone who posted a review that their customer service is excellent.

Little tip: if you ask for a cup of water, they will give you a 12 oz water in their wild flower plastic cups with lip for free. 

I am deff a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Great portions. Great selection. The employees are kind and helpful. The atmosphere is pleasant and inviting for fellowship among friends."}
{"text":"My son and I had breakfast here and the food was amazing. I ordered the arugula salad because I wanted a piece of pie and didn't want too many calories. I've never eaten arugula before so I wanted to try it. Usually when you eat a salad it's nothing spectacular. This salad made me happy it was so good. My son had the banana pancakes. When he tasted the syrup he said \"This must be real maple syrup.\" So happy he enjoyed his meal. I make a piont to spend time alone with each of my children. Taking them to a place that has good service and good food is important to me. Wildflower Bread Company will see us again."}
{"text":"This morning, my husband and I had our breakfast at Wildflower in Tempe.  As usual all the regular smiling faces were there.  Kris, our cashier, was wonderful and gave us exceptional service.  We truly appreciate all the 'Breadheads' at the Tempe Wildflower and will continue to return.  This place is busy but the food and service rock!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and nice sizes! I can eat everything here. Perfect pancakes! 

I just wish they had gluten free options but I understand it would be hard to have GF on such a wheat environment. 

Chandler and Tempe locations are both great with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Customer service is STELLAR! 

Right away they were super helpful. Very down to earth staff that showed genuine interest in serving me and everyone around me very well!!!

Ordered the wildflower chopped salad!! SOO GOOD! I travel often and never had I had such a fresh healthy salad at an airport. So many other things look so good too. Now I know where to stop when I'm in Phoenix airport!!!"}
{"text":"this place only gets three stars because of the crowd.

the food is good and not your average breakfast faire, but coming here on a weekend morning is not fun if you're not upper middle class or sporting head to toe matching bicycling gear with your spouse.

if you're tattooed, disheveled or hung over, you'll get stares. plus the last three times i was there my food came out wrong and/or cold. bummer."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower Cafe! Cranberry orange scone is my go to item, along with their iced tea. The BLT plus sandwich is my favorite for lunch, I get the chips for my side. Chopped salad is my second favorite. Two thumbs up and 5 stars every time!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have literally spent the last week at this place studying for a national exam we have coming up. We've eaten 2-3 meals here per day for the last five days and honestly everything I've had has been so good. And the prices are great! What I love the most are the people who work there. They are so friendly. Everyone coming to our table and promptly removing plates, the manager just asking if we're doing ok, and making sure the Internet is working right. I mean really a nice place so spend a morning, evening, and like us... Entire days!! :)"}
{"text":"I was determined to try local bakeries before submitting to the chain bakeries.  But after going through so much for just a piece of nice bread/pastry, I was ready to give up.  After reading the reviews for this place, I decided to give it a try since I go to Trader Joe's right next door usually anyways.

I tried few pastries to go and every single one of them was really yummy!
*Blueberry cream cheese muffin = YUM
*Cheese danish = YUM
*Chocolate croissant = YUM
*Chocolate palmier = YUM

*Location = good, next to Trader Joe's
*Service = good
*Price = good

So yeah, I'm definitely going back...I'm done wasting my time to find that special local bakery."}
{"text":"Was out early doing chores on a Saturday morning in an area we were not familiar with and we were searching for breakfast/ brunch. I just recalled a strip mall area with several restaurants and Wildflower was the first restaurant we passed and stated breakfast. 
Instantly liked the music the guitar guy on premises was playing. Larger menu for breakfast than expected. I had the Honey-cured Ham & Brie Frittata. It was done just perfect (I hate over done eggs) and the ingredients were great together- loved the sauteed apples. It came with the home fries which were yummy (just a little salty) roasted red skin potatoes with rosemary and toast. It was very filling. The Blackberry Orange Lemonade was light and refreshing. My hubby had the Sausage & Egg Sandwich. He said it was delicious, but he did have difficulty with the Ciabatta roll being too chewy for the eggs. So, he took off the top and ate it open face. 
Look forward to going back to try the sandwiches, pasta and baked goods!"}
{"text":"Great local place for pasta, soups, salads. sandwiches, breakfast...  you know I don't eat here as often as I should. Manager Frank was super great tonight... just chit chatting and brought us some to go boxes... I really do love this place... lol"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before flying home.  The reviews looked good and the sandwiches were spectacular.  I told them I was in from out of town and they gave me some home fries to try because I said they looked good. The pretzels were huge and awesome, so we're the chocolate chip cookies.  All the cashiers were smiling and helpful. The cost was premium but very well worth it!  Great job Wildflower!  BTW, we ordered the Roast Beef, Ham & Cheese, BLT and one other. Everyone said they were great."}
{"text":"It was really good! The bread is fresh and I love there broccoli and cheddar soup!"}
{"text":"Came here for a cup of soup to go. I guess there is a spot for pick up orders and the regular line. I assumed since I was taking to go I would be able to order my soup and go since I had to be back in to work in 15 minutes. The girl at the register asked me for a pick up order and I told her I didn't know I had to call ahead and I just wanted a cup of soup to go. She informed me Id have to wait in the regular mile long line just to get a to go order because I had not ordered it on the phone. So I can go outside place the order on my phone and pick it up..but when it comes to asking you in the store I cant? If someone is getting something to go most of the time its because their in a hurry and need to get back to work. She was very rude and told me well the line is going pretty fast anyways. Well needless to say by the time I got the soup and returned to work my break was up and I couldn't even eat the soup! I really loved Wildflower but I that put such a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about wildflower bit always consistently delicious. Everything is fresh. And I think  The lemon marscapone pancakes with blueberry compote is possibly one of the best breakfast I've had."}
{"text":"Okay..... the maple pecan pastry is AMAZING! Great addition to the already lovely assortments of pastries. It's like French toast and pecan pie had a flaky pastry baby."}
{"text":"My go to is always the potatoe cream cheese soup no matter what it! They sandwiches r preatty great as well im great place for everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many many times over the years and will always prefer their food over Panera. The food is delicious(normally)! That being said, someone definitely needs to put some money into maintaining this place and properly training its employees. Last visit, I ordered a salad and let's just say it was all dressing...to the point where it made me nauseous when I was trying to choke it down. I brushed it off when the management told me they were training someone new in the kitchen so it wasn't a big deal. This past visit, however, there was soap present in the green tea and the booths are falling apart. When you're asking someone to pay $9 a plate, there should be higher standards than this...I may just make the very long drive to the one in Scottsdale or the one at Chandler mall as I have been extremely disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"Love the iced tea here and coffee drinks. Food is really good to. I frequent this place. A great place to meet with friends. Dog friendly patio. I've met some great people here just hanging out on patio enjoying the great weather."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Wildflower Bread during a Phoenix trip.  My first impressions led me to believe this was a Panera-lite.  I learned soon after the food and service were far superior to Panera.

I ordered the ruben, a tasty, succulent sandwich on rye bread.  It came with a side of red potato salad.

The restaurant was immaculate, modern, and warm.  The host, cashier, and the bus boy were so friendly that I could have mistaken them for family.

I can't pinpoint whether Wildflower ferociously trains their staff, or if they are simply divinely gifted in hiring some of the most cordial waitstaff."}
{"text":"I always come for lunch but never for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the frittata with maple ham. It was made to order and was very nice. My partner had the cinnamon French toast and very tasty as well. I now have another option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Have been here many, many times and they've only messed up one or two orders; when they do they make it right.  There are definitely times when the wait is long and even if it isn't the food takes longer than other fast food... but you should expect that to some degree with the quality being so much better."}
{"text":"We ordered the Lemon Riocotta Pancakes, Cinnamon Brioche Hazelnut French Toast, Feta and Pesto Sandwhich, Potato Cream Cheese Soup, and Chocolate Cake and everything was just okay and overpriced. I would say everything is worth half of the amount we paid."}
{"text":"This place can be a bit crowded. They dissapointed me on St. Patricks day by selling out of soda bread by noon. Hello-! workin' Irish girls need bread too! However the blueberry bron stugar waffles with orange spread instead of butter make up for it!"}
{"text":"Abriana helped us during our visit today. She was so friendly and nice! Keep up the good work, darlin! You're doing great!"}
{"text":"It's really fresh, good food for a chain. Chicken salad was very good and their mushroom soup was tasty as well. Nothing to get excited about. But a good place for lunch. Clean, quick and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Hmm.  Given the other reviews, I guess we are the only people especially privileged to have problems with seating.  I don't dislike this place, but have found you need a lunch-time strategy to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. drop two friends at the door while the third parks the car, one friend orders while the other is on reconnaissance to find a table).  It ends up working out in the end as I have never received my plate in my hands, but eating here is not a leisurely lunch - not by a long shot!  The food and drinks are good, but not worth the trouble of our \"tag-team\" effort.  The best part (reason for going) is the adjoining book store, and so frequent when looking for a particular title or needing a gift."}
{"text":"best best best restaurant for soup salad sandwich bread pastries. this place is absolutely fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love wildflower! This is my favorite location because it's right next to changing hands bookstore. Wish they had more seating because I find myself waiting for a table during early morning brunch. Try the pesto chicken with linguini if you like pesto! They rotate new flavors which helps keep things interesting and give you different menu options. They have high chairs for the kids and simple kids menu but decent kid serving."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh offerings in a nice casual setting, with free WIFI"}
{"text":"Great food at the mall.  Fresh, wholesome ingredients. I had the tuna sandwich and mushroom soup which was incredible.  Maybe the best thing I've had here (and I've eaten here a lot).  The bread is truly amazing here. 

Sometimes their salads have too much dressing for my tastes so order on the side if that's an issue for you. 

If you go for lunch or brunch on Saturday or Sunday (especially Sunday) be prepared for big crowds (hunting for a free table) and a long wait for your food.  Despite that when the food comes it's still great."}
{"text":"Really love this particular Wildflower, clean, great service, and excellent preparation of food! I'd like to thank Anthony in particular, as well as Ferner for going the extra mile for my family and I. Thanks!! :)"}
{"text":"Second visit on a 2-day trip.  I've been here over the past 10 years at least 100 times.  The food is consistently good - great baked bread, pastries, sandwiches, and breakfast.  My understanding is that the owner went to France to find a great chef to create the bread...you need great bread for a great sandwich.  The premise seems to have worked, as the restaurant has now exploded into a chain within AZ. 
I personally recommend the Bear Claws and Chocolate Croissants amongst the baked goods.  I usually have the Ham and Egg sandwich on whole grain, instead of the Ciabatta, but both breads are delicious.  I also recommend the banana pancakes.  My only reason for going 4-stars is this particular visit I pointed out the pancakes didn't have much banana (if at all) in the batter.  The staff courteously offered to remake, but they were good nonetheless.  
The atmosphere is brighter than other restaurants in this space, e.g., Panera and Paradise Bakery.  They have newspapers for one to browse through, bread samples upon entrance, and great coffee.  Lastly, there are multiple booths, and all have outlets located beneath, which caters to those needing a break from the home office, or the worker on the go.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"When it comes to commercial sandwich, soups, and salad places Wildflower is the best option. They have a better variety of food and it just seems fresher than other places. 

Lately, I have been obsessed with kale and chicken salads with a light lemony vinaigrette and Wildflower has it! I even passed up pizza today to have this salad which is just crazy! 

While I love this place, there were a couple of things that I would have liked to see differently. First, I visited at lunch time (12:00 pm) so of course they were super busy. Unfortunately, they only had one cashier, creatinine a very long line. The second item is that my salad was definitely overdressed, which seems to be common at restaurants. Next time I will need to order it on the side. Even with these things, I still recommend Wildflower especially if you are looking for healthier options. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a girlier Panera with better tasting food. I came here for brunch with a friend. I ordered a feta & roasted vegetable egg-white frittata and it was really scrumptious and a healthier option than most other breakfast places. I liked that they substituted the eggs at no extra charge. Other than the fact that the food took awhile to come out - which is perfectly understandable, since it was rather crowded, I have no complaints about my experience here. A great place to have brunch or lunch in the area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for average you've found it.  This place is Panera Bread with a different name, right down to labeling and signage in the restaurant.  Food is literally as average as it gets.  Staff were friendly and courteous and I'd give the shift manager that was here today 5 stars."}
{"text":"A favorite Phoenix stop. I love this place.  AZ's version of Panera just better. Like everything in AZ. 
I come in the a.m. for the fresh daily pastries.  And the breakfasts are fantastic. 
The servers always make sure everything is in order and you're well taken care of. You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Scrumptious salads and sandwiches, I'd happily go back for another meal! I ordered the asian salad and it was extremely fresh and had perfect flavor. My friend ordered the roast beef sandwich and said the beef was excellent and sliced nice and thick! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so appalled by what I'm listening to while waiting for my food at this location! The cooks and servers cursing back and fourth using the f word freely and saying how people's orders are bs in the full form! How on earth is this acceptable for employees! This place has great food but needs to be re-staffed ASAP!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed and there's nothing I can do about it, other than not come to Wildflower anymore. I know it's the end of the day, but associates, you MUST let your customers know when you are out of something. You have got to improve on everyone being on the same page. I ordered a Tuscan kale salad and cup of potato soup to go. They didn't tell me they were out of kale until after they handed me my order. I ordered this particular salad for the kale. Not the biggest deal, so I brushed it off. I get home, and I find a long ass blonde hair mixed in with my salad, and apparently they were out of sourdough bread too, because they slipped in two different types of bread with my order. Those were harder to brush off because I ordered specifically for the tasty sour bread to go with it, and the hair is just a BIG no from me. They most likely didn't portion my salad correctly, they definitely rushed my order. Or they really don't put in any effort in their \"late night\" orders. I don't know, I spent $15 on an order that was wrong on many levels. Ugh I'm just so disappointed :("}
{"text":"I am so grateful to finally get a Wildflower in the neighborhood.  I love all the pastries there, and their hot breakfasts, soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastas hit the spot throughout the day.  Service is brisk when you order a cook-to-order item: order at the counter, sit down with a color-coded table sign, and a serviceperson delivers the food to your table in minutes.  I haven't noticed a big lag in wait time, even at peak hours.   Best of all, because of the quasi-fast food setup, it's a setting you can feel comfortable dining in whether alone or with a group of friends.

A big con: the convergence of Pei Wei, Wildflower, and Pita Jungle make the shopping plaza this location is situated in a nightmare to negotiate through during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Great food as at all their locations. The biggest problem here is very poor acoustics to the point where the noise was extremely irritating. We were there over lunch and it was only about 1/2 to 1/3 full, and yet I couldn't hear the person next to me. I felt like I was in a loud noisy bar. I'm not sure if it's due to the very high ceilings, all the glass, or what, but hopefully they can do something to improve on this. The noise was so bad it will keep me from going back to that location."}
{"text":"Cassandra was extremely helpful and sweet! I love this location! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OH MY FREAKIN' PEA POD! This place has the freshest food. I am in love with it and so upset that I have to wait until my next trip to AZ to get some. 

I had the Wildflower Chicken Salad Sandwich. Ever since I tried that, I have put bean sprouts and sunflower seeds on everything. The little ramekin of potato salad that came as a side was so delicious, too! Sweet and salty with a good and surprising CRUNCH!

The place reminds me of a Panera Bread, but geared more towards sustainable food and healthy eating. I absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Overall, I like Wild Flower. This location isn't my fave tho. It's always really busy, which I understand but the employees don't have a sense of urgency when it comes to the rush. They're very casual here. I usually go for lunch or dinner. I'd like to come back in the morning so that I could try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Super nice employees and the one with long hair was an outstanding employer. I would come back here and recommend this place to anyone because of this employee."}
{"text":"Best bread, yummy soups, delicious pastas, perfect salads. I love wildflower so so much.  They are also extremely accommodating with adding this or removing that and requests for extra bread. I am not easy to please but cannot think of one bad thing to say. Ten out of ten. I wish I could give more stars."}
{"text":"Typically their soups are very good. I am not a vegetarian however I feel like their vegetarian soups are packed full of flavor. My all time favorite selection is the chopped salad. Lunch and dinner are packed and can take a while to get food so be prepared."}
{"text":"Went to Wildflower this morning for Mother's Day. My mom always requests it because they give moms a free loaf of their delicious bread on Mother's Day. Food was amazing - per usual. I have the veggie frittata. Comes with bread and potatoes. Everything was great. And although this is a walk-up and order at the counter place, try bring out your food, brought my mom a water, and grabbed hot sauce of me, even after I had gotten up to walk in to get it myself. Someone stopped me, asked what I needed and insisted she get it. The manager checked on us to make we enjoyed our meal at the end. Everyone was great. Perfect way to start Mother's Day. We will be back again on Mother's Day for sure"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I had breakfast at the Phoenix airport location. From other reviews, it seems like this is an Arizona chain. We had a 6 am flight (going home to Texas for Thanksgiving). We got to the airport so early, the gates to security were still closed! (My bad, travel anxiety...) So we had time to kill and this was the only place open.

We both got hot sandwiches. I got the one with egg, spicy sausage, chipotle mayo (I think) and spinach. It was spicy!!!! I had mixed feelings on the bread itself, but the stuff on the inside was good. My boyfriend got the ultimate bacon and egg sandwich. He liked the bacon and the egg but decided he didn't like arugula (which he had never tried before). 

There seemed to be a lot of good options on the menu. The prices are what you would expect eating at the airport. 

They had a good selection of juices and the people working were nice for it being super early in the morning. They were a little disorganized, they brought my sandwich out before Tim's. But the lady apologized. And hey, it was 4 in the freaking morning... And the place was clean."}
{"text":"While waiting for my sandwich to be prepared, noticed a sick employee making the sandwiches. Had gloves on but kept wiping her nose with her sleeve etc.  this is how we get sick while traveling folks. I requested a refund and they graciously gave it to me."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is thought of as good but cannot say it's bad. Not because of the food but because of everything else that comes with it. Location is kind of awkward planted in the middle of a parking lot to bigger stores so it can get crowded. The food: of course it can be very good because of the combinations of food they put together but increasingly I find that the quality and attention to detail of how they prepare their food isn't very good. Looks sloppy and they are counting on the flavors of the ingredients to make the meal. Something is missing and not sure if it's spices or what but maybe it's that they allow the food to get soggy or stale depending on what you order. I've skipped out on reviewing in the past because I wasn't blown away by anything good or bad and my trips here have been rushed on my part. My last trip was a to go order and the most disrespectful action by an employee took place. I was in line when the young employee behind the register was flustered trying to handle the previous order. The order was complete and as I awaited to be tended to, what looked to be a manager approached another register and called for the customers behind me to serve them. I made it very apparent that I was next and I was completely ignored. Eventually I placed my order and as usual, it was a very plain order of food with nothing but fancy titles. Not on my list for returning any time soon. Of course...they got my order wrong."}
{"text":"went to your web site around 8:30 on Fri to see when you guys close. you guys need to put hours on your web site. had party of 11, but no hours. went to another restaurant. but i do enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Unbelievable customer service!  These guys aim to please!!! You can tell Felix, Raul & Jaime really love they do!  It shows! Besides the great food and healthier choices for airport food--I'll continue to go back mainly because of Felix, Raul & Jaime!!!  They're at gate A9!"}
{"text":"Wildflower at the Chandler Mall provided lunch for Teacher Appreciation week at my school. The sandwhiches were fresh, perfectly put together, and delicious. The salads were full of fresh and mouth watering produce, and the cookies were to die for! The staff at Circle Cross Ranch raved about the lunch for days. 

Thank you Ethan! You definitely earned yourself some life long customers!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. I usually hate corporate places like panera/ paradise bakery but this place does an amazing job. Everytime your food is consistent and excellent. I wish they had a frequent flyer card."}
{"text":"Great soup, excellent tuna sandwich but they tried to clear my table while I was at the register getting dessert. My eye glasses were there, to-go container with soup, Half full coffee cup and my jacket was on the chair."}
{"text":"I like this bakery very much after my visit to Sedona. They serve delicious sandwich with fresh veggies and good soup as well. Today I enjoyed eating half BLT and spicy chicken enchilada soup. Both must be great for me and I could recommend to eat them here. Last week I came here and enjoyed foods of course. When I come to Phx, I have to come here to eat fresh sandwich!"}
{"text":"I like this bakery very much. I was impressed with their breads in Sedona and we have started to use this bakery anywhere. This bakery has been started recently so I am very happy to eat their breads in the airport as well. 

Update
Today I enjoyed eating their half and half set of soup and bread. That set has good size for lunch actually."}
{"text":"I love Panera and moved to Phoenix from Pittsburgh, so gave Wildflower a try. Actually, two tries.

The first time, I was quoted a ten minute wait for my to go order. A combo with a half sandwich and salad. Twenty two minutes later my food came, with a profuse apology. And it had mushrooms on it even though I said I didn't want them.

 

I figured maybe it was a fluke, so I tried again today. A To go order again, just a sandwich, nothing else, with no special requests. I wasn't quoted a time. Six people ordered To go orders after me. Six people. All six got their orders, and I am sitting there still waiting. I was the only one left waiting on the bench for four more minutes. And finally my order showed up. I didn't care at that point what the lady told me was in my bag, I just wanted out of there.

I live a quarter mile away from there. I went straight home and opened my bag. My bread was completely soggy, which I guess I could forgive if the sandwich was hot, steam could do that. BUT....the meat was cold to the touch. How long did the staff just ignore my order and let it sit there. I almost called the manager. Almost. But I wasn't bothering to drive back there anyways, so just chocked it up to a loss.


I don't know what's wrong with the Deer Valley location on Agua Fria in North Phoenix, but they seriously need to fix their To Go issues. I won't be returning to any Wildflower from now on. Panera's food is just as good, and the service is so much better than this location's. I will wait til I go back home."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. My first time at Wildflower. The gentleman helping me order was very friendly. He helped me customize a breakfast sandwich with chicken and regular scrambled eggs instead of egg whites- it absolutely delicious. Another coworker even delivered the food to my table and they gave me a free cookie for being so excited about the sandwich and wildflower experience. Amazing customer service and loved the sandwich!"}
{"text":"If you like to try Fresh bread, you should try here.
The vienna bread that I bought for the toast was pretty good."}
{"text":"After being stranded at the Phoenix Airport by a missed flight connection, I was craving something really satisfying. Wildflower really hit the spot! It's just outside the security checkpoint, so if you're on a layover like I was, keep that in mind. I ordered the Asian chicken salad as-is. It's SO fresh and healthy, and more filling than I expected! The blend of ingredients is kind of unique, with elements like jicama and roasted almonds really punctuating the tangy-sweet sauce. The bread it came with was a little dry but not bad. I also got a passion tea to drink, which is unsweetened. The flavor is very mild, so don't expect anything mind-blowing there. There are a few outlets to charge your phone if you need one. All in all, I enjoyed this place! Wish I had one back home - I could eat this salad every day!"}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi...I don't get a very good connection here. There is no time restrictions like Paradise Bakery does during rush hour times, though. Also they don't block every freakin' site (that I know of)  like Peter Piper does...plus they don't have a bunch of kids running around spilling stuff on your computer.

Lunch time is pretty crowded...it is hard to find a seat. I usually go early in the morning when they first open or around 3 to avoid the crowd. I don't know how dinner is, though.

Prices are a little higher than Paradise I think considering the portions are smaller. Sandwiches and salads are 6-8 dollars. I've had the tuna and chicken salad sandwiches. It was way to much clover sprouts. I like sprouts, but it was like 75% of the sandwich. I like the chicken salad as a salad though. I also got the emerald spinach salad. The spicy pecans were so good! Oriental salad was good, a little heavy on the dressing. Not a big dressing person, so if your like me ask for it on the side. Their soups are good and they always have at least 2 vegetarian options...I used to be for 7 years so I know how amazing that is. I got the new mayan chai latte...i loved it. My friend hated it, so I guess thats how it goes love it or hate it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!! We visited 2 locations while on vacation in AZ and wished I could've gone every day. Awesome selection ,wanted to try everything.
I had the superfood salad at this location and it was amazing!! My daughter tried the mixed grill sandwich and it was really good too. We tried the layered chocolate cake and strawberry rhubarb pie and loved them both. Puts panera to shame...Please come to Florida!!!!"}
{"text":"So happy I finally discovered this place!  So far I've only had the Chicken & Kale salad (the closest tasting to True Food Kitchen's Tuscan Kale so far) and the chicken pesto sandwich with the potato salad.
 My in - laws had a corn beef brisket and the scrambled egg, feta and tomato sandwich. They loved it also! Will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, first time ever. I looked at the menu beforehand so I knew that I was going to order the grilled cheese. Upon arrival, the parking lot was jammed full, took me a loop around before I could even park. It was very crowded but the line wasn't too long. The girl was nice when I ordered-it was odd that they don't have regular iced tea (she DID offer to give me a cup with hot tea and ice though-I declined) oh And she Asked me if i wanted utensils, as thought i was expected to slurp up my potato salad with my fingers or something...that was really weird. anyway, it took FOREVER to get my order (to go) I even had to go up and ask if my order had gotten lost..now sitting down to eat, everything looks decent. My grilled cheese tastes pretty good, but the bread, 9-grain, almost broke my tooth on all the grains. And the arugula was a little soggy (probably due to the wait time)The potato salad was delicious though, I'd definitely want more of that. I'll have to switch sandwich types if I ever go back though."}
{"text":"I would literally go here 1-2 times a week, sometimes more. But I'm so over this place. What is so hard about keeping a consistent menu? By all means, have a seasonal menu. They literally got rid of everything I would order. Y'all should hire Brad's Wife. I'm sure she'd help ya out."}
{"text":"Today was out first time at this establishment and it was great! The energy here was so postive! The front end cashier laughed with me and another employee suggested a sandwich for us after seeing that we weren't quite sure what to have, while we were waiting for our sandwiches an employee was cleaning tables and singing along with another employee to the music playing in the restaurant. Great experience! Every single employee in there was smiling! The food was DELICIOUS!!! We will be back! It's worth the drive from Anthem!"}
{"text":"Went here after shopping and didn't want to cook dinner. My wife got a pistachio pomegranate chicken salad, daughter got chicken linguini and i got a Turkey Waldorf salad. The food was all very good but the outstanding service from Gavin Logan really made for a nice experience. Our ordering experience wasn't as good with a grouchy lady taking our order but Gavin made sure that we had everything we had for our order and we were satisfied. Grouchy lady is the only reason I deducted a star. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this chain.

I had the Ham and Brie Frittata with a large coffee, and my partner had the Sausage and Egg sandwich with a Mocha Mania.

We both thought that while the flavours were very nice, the portions seemed a bit small for the price.

ETA: While at the time, we both thought the portions were a bit small, my partner later changed his mind when he realized that he was still not hungry about 6 hours later.
I will admit it was my first time having a frittata, so I may have been expecting the wrong thing. I was thinking it would be more of an open faced omelette, or a scramble, and it was more of an 'egg pancake'..."}
{"text":"After sampling their tasty roast beef and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes in a champagne glass at Yelp in Bloom I HAD to have this for lunch the next day. I woke up the following morning craving it and immediately looked up their menu online. I found the braised beef sandwich and called in my order. The quoted my 15 minutes, but I got there in less than 10 and it was ready. You can pick up call in orders at the first register when you walk right in. So convenient. They also have seating right outside on the sidewalk, but it's not covered so there isn't much shade around during the lunch hour. 

It was everything I remembered. Whoever thought of putting mashed potatoes in a sandwich was brilliant. The sandwich comes with roast beef with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and you get a side of horseradish and au jus on the side. It also comes with sweet potato chips. 

Well done, Wildflower. Well done. I was never much of a fan of yours before, but this one is a winner."}
{"text":"Great place. I had the half sandwich turkey blt which was really good and a decent price. Sometimes i get the plain bagel toasted with cream cheese which is also really filling and tasty. This location is super convenient for me because I work just down the hall  in the newsstand. And the best thing about this place is some of the nicest and friendliest employees. I will definately keep coming here. Located by gate a9"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town!  Always consistent and delicious!  Love the frittatas and my daughter loves the chocolate chip pancakes!  The service is excellent and the manager Laura is a doll!!"}
{"text":"Perfect bakery! It was my first time eating there and an employee named Anthony was nice enough to give me free cookies! I definitely recommend the carrot cake and ice Wildflower latte."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed with this place. I visited for my first time and got the buffalo chicken sandwich. It wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting - 2 tough pieces of bread with some thin sliced chicken between, buffalo sauce and some strange dried crumbs .. as if there wasn't enough carbs to begin with. 

I always strive to support local businesses like this but the food just didn't meet my expectations. I wish I would've gotten the chopped salad but I chose the sandwich so that I could try the bread. I guess I'll just have to go simpler next time. (A lot of people were getting soups so maybe that's a better option too.)

Overall, great little cozy homey space and the free WiFi is a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place. I feel like everything is fresh and it just feels good to eat good food. I have found my favorite thing on the menu so far is the Roast Beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. It is soooo good. Also love their tea. Always clean, food comes out promptly, and I love to sit outside and say hi to all the doggies that come to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here. Not just this location either, they all seem to have the same standards and all meet them highly. Absolutely love this place. Soups are amazing and plenty to eat. Salads are absolutely tasty. Grab one of each and feast with a partner. 


Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Don't get it. Usually this place has great food & service; I was surprised today. While placing our order lady manager comes over and interrupts cashier, asking her to change soup sign, when a line of customer waits to place order, WTH!! Finally sit down and guy sitting next to us is so pissed off , because his pancake order has gone missing. They finally get his order, but customer is still obviously upset.  Then as we sit having breakfast they are scrambling to find another order. I don't know what happened here but they better get there act together."}
{"text":"Take some advice: don't order the turkey and Brie sandwich. The turkey might as well have been boiled for how much flavor it had, and the mustard was so strong it was all I could taste. Blech."}
{"text":"Health conscious people pay attention! 

We come here almost every weekend after our morning hike.  There's always room to sit outside during the coolest months of the year. 

The food is delicious and healthy. They offer a lot of variety. Their banana bread is to die for and their coffee is rich and sumptuous."}
{"text":"The WFBC is one of my favorite go-to's when I want something crisp, refreshing and whole to fill my tummy. As a busy parent, I rarely have time to sit and eat-in so most of the orders I place are To-Go. I just have to share my appreciation for Teresa who, fortunately for me, always takes my order over the phone. After the WFBC made some slight changes to some of their menu items that I enjoy on a regular basis, it became hard to remember exactly what I liked in my order. Luckily, Teresa always knows exactly what I want to order down to the smallest detail (the old dressing vs. the new, the additional thinly sliced chicken breast, etc...) Her attention to detail is fabulous and her vibrant and loving personality shines bright at this location."}
{"text":"You can feel good when you eat the food here. The people that work here were really super nice and that was a good thing considering how busy they are. They move people in and out fast but are super friendly doing it. I did not feel rushed and I really like the BLT I got.  Yes the food here is really good but I also really like friendly people."}
{"text":"I ordered pasta with Alfredo sauce and salmon.  The salmon was disgusting.  It looked gray and unappetizing and had fake grill marks to make it appear freshly grilled.  Who are they kidding? I suggested to the manager that the salmon be removed from the menu if that was the best they could do. The Alfredo sauce was okay."}
{"text":"Excellent place to breakfast or lunch.  Large high quality sandwiches.  The chicken salad sandwich is so good piled with fresh vegetables (cucumbers, sprouts n' stuff) on tasty fresh 9-grain bread, that it would be worth getting without the chicken salad.  

Enjoying good quality food while reading the New York Times they provide was a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Maria kindly created a customer order for my husband today and he loved it! We've been coming for Wildflower for years. The food is always excellent and the staff is so friendly! Make sure to get a scone. They're so yummy!"}
{"text":"I really love Wildflower because you can quickly get a good meal with quality ingredients at a reasonable price point.  

I specifically love this store because the service is great and the store is always immaculately clean.

Also, kudos to Wildflower's CEO, Louis Basile, for having a twitter presence and for caring about the guests' experiences."}
{"text":"First time here and found out they just opened. Very clean, great staff. Food was awesome, my sandwich was huge! The cashier Jeri was great with suggestions, she came over later and asked if I needed anything and how I was enjoying everything, best customer service I've ever had."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because its close to home and I like a couple other Wildflower locations, but my recent experience was not good. On my recent visit, the restaurant needs some deep cleaning, new staff (front and kitchen and mgt) and remodel.  It took 20 minutes for our food to come to our table - Very slow. Kitchen area was not well kept as our booth was near the kitchen.  There was stuff stored on the floor that should not have been.  This place needs new management."}
{"text":"A connecting flight home helped me run across this place. It was late so the kitchens were closed, but sandwiches and salads still in the glass case could still be purchased. I got the Turkey, tomato, and brie sandwich. It was just what I needed after an extremely long (and much longer to come) day. Not too light, but also not too heavy on the Las Vegas battered stomach of mine. Good place!"}
{"text":"The mall is not always the best place to find good food, but Wildflower is a hidden gem in the Chandler Fashion Mall, serving up fresh, good food that's moderately priced.  There's something for everyone here no matter what meal you seek--breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it is all good.

Breakfast is served later on the weekends, but it's worth getting up for on any weekday.  Their frittatas are delicious, but I'm nuts about the toast.  The bread is flavorful, crispy, and chewy all at once.  Just make sure you ask for jam.  It comes in a cute glass container, and the flavors are divine.

Lunch is usually why I come here, and Wildflower never fails to disappoint.  As a vegetarian, coming to a bakery can sometimes be difficult.  Not many places offer veggie-friendly sandwiches that are actually tasty, but Wildflower offers several.  My favorite is the roasted sweet potato, but the portobello picnic is climbing the charts.  They rotate through a seemingly-endless selection of soups, and always offer at least one (though usually 2) vegetarian-friendly soups each day.  My favorite?  The vegetarian black bean.  Hearty, mildly spiced, and served piping hot.  I wish they served it every single day, but even if they aren't, I have half a dozen menu items from which to choose.

I finally had their pasta the other day, and this has proven to be the second-biggest disappointment about this restaurant.  This isn't to say that it was bad!  In comparison to the rest of their stellar food, the pasta was merely satisfactory.  Still filling, and still a masterful medley of flavors and ingredients not often found in food at chain restaurants.

Desserts are rather \"eh.\"  Twice I've had the coconut lemon torte (I think that's what it's called?) and while the flavors blended well, it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have, and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again.

Still, the fast, friendly service and excellent breakfast/lunch menu is enough to make me rate this place 4 stars.  Even during the lunch rush I've not had to wait more than a few minutes for my food, though it can be next to impossible to find a table sometimes."}
{"text":"I want to say that the people here are amazing. I was keeled over on the airport floor next to the bathroom (due to food poisoning from mexico), and the manager at wildflower bread company, Lauren, noticed me and came to my aid. She gave me water, checked up on me, and eventually called the airport medical team for me.
It's so rare you meet people who care about the well being of strangers, but she is one of them. I'm sorry to say I couldn't try the food, but sometime what makes a place great, is the people. And I'm sure her care for others reflects in the food they serve, and the company they run. Thank you Lauren!

{"text":"While the food is good/great- I can't for the life of me figure out who designed their kids menu ( which isn't even posted on the wall BTW)! The options for bread are 9 grain and sourdough- my kids always eat whole wheat at home so 9 grain was ok- although the crust was really well- crusty- and then the worst part is that they use spicy brown mustard on a kids ham and cheese! At first I thought my daughter was being dramatic and then I tried it- seriously, how is that at all kid friendly?! Plus the parking lot is ridiculous - prob the worst parking lot I've dealt with since being in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  We live in Surprise and make the trek at least once a week to get awesome food.  Everything I've tried has been amazing.  The new firey roasted mango salad is good, the traditional wildflower salad is good, the chop salad (minus feta) is good and I always have to get a chocolate chip scone.  My only gripe is the small drinks and the location of the soda machine."}
{"text":"Wildflower is a good alternative to Paradise if you like bakery style places but are tired of the same old thing. This location is very clean and the service is friendly and prompt. They've never gotten an order wrong or kept me waiting too long. Everything I've ever tried there has been excellent, especially the sweet potato sandwich. I love that the side of fruit comes with some yogurt and granola on top! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was here about a week ago.

Busy but not too busy to a seat could be had.

Friendly folks working here and quick to get the food out.

The sandwich was fine as they always are.

The soup was good as well.

Gus enjoys this place more than I, but for me it is fine enough that I do not go in kicking and screaming.

I have never seen so many folks with laptops humming away and no sign of food next to them so I assume they have eaten and are now done. I guess the hazard of offering free wifi."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped by for dinner after an appointment because we like Wildflower, and we didn't want to go somewhere that would be too crowded on a Friday night.  Wildflower is, for many people, more of a lunch spot, so it was just right in terms of the crowd level.  It wasn't dead, but there were plenty of tables, and we opted to eat outside because it was so chilly inside (my only minor complaint).  I ordered the Wildflower Two combo with a turkey and brie sandwich and a Caesar salad.  My wife ordered her favorite salad, the Wildflower Salad, with chicken added to it.  Although the food didn't take an extraordinarily long time to arrive at our table, it was apparently too long for Tristan, the server who was serving us, and he offered us free dessert for the inconvenience.  Wow, now that's great customer service!  My sandwich was incredibly fresh, and the salad was great, too, though keep in mind that they do put mushrooms on their Caesar here, so just ask them to leave them off if you're not a fan.  My wife adores the Wildflower Salad, and it was as good as ever.  She loves the fact that it's a complex salad both in terms of quantity and flavor.  She told the server that it's one of her top three salads of all time.  True to his word, Tristan came back to ask us about dessert, and we ordered carrot cake because we had seen it on the way in, and it looked fantastic.  We like carrot cake with a lot going on in it (meaning that it has a lot of chunky ingredients as opposed to just a smooth cake texture), and this one has that.  Once we asked for the carrot cake, he said he would bring us TWO pieces.  We didn't expect more than one to share, and we even told him so, but two pieces it was.  We got them to go so we could eat them later, and he boxed them up for us.  Kudos to this Wildflower location for the great food and the even greater attention paid to its customers!"}
{"text":"OK, really didn't expect this at the airport of all places but we had a great breakfast there this morning!  Scrambled eggs and oatmeal were all hot & freshly prepared.  And, the best part was we had 3! employees stop by the table to ask if we needed anythiing.  Really!  At the airport!  We were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.  Thanks Wildflower!"}
{"text":"On the way back from NY and since I'm still on East Coast time, I'm hungry. 
Wildflower was the closest to my gate. 
Got a Albacore Almond Tuna on Challah bread. 
Requested no mayo on the bread (yeah, I know tuna salad is made with mayo) because I despise it!
They made me a fresh one and it was great.  
The bread was fresh, slightly sweet and just a little chewy. Actually the bread was awesome. 
Came with almonds, apple (not too much in fact I didn't notice it until the last bite), celery, scallions, Swiss, tomato and Romaine with grain mustard. 
Pretty darn good. 
Not as good as a Bella Napoli Mixed Italian in Albany but, a nice sandwich. 
Quick and clean and they even have chargers at their high top tables to recharge those drained cell phone batteries. 
Check it out. I think you would agree that this is way better than that other sandwich place."}
{"text":"I love the Wildflower Bread company. The have a nice menu and the price is decent. However, after my visit to this particular location yesterday, I have to rate this a 2 star. Service was the reason for only 2 stars. The place was not all that busy but yet it took me 15 minutes to flag someone down to clean the table I selected. And the person I flagged down seemed annoyed that I asked him to wipe the table down. Next, I'm standing at the register for a few minutes waiting to order, the guy at the register keeps his head down as he is busy doing something and then just walks away, No acknowledgment of my existence, no I'll be right back, just walks away. Not one staff member at this location had a smile on their face. Not one person was friendly or seemed happy to be servicing customers. 

On a more positive note I will say that the Food was good and delivered to my table timely."}
{"text":"Very noisy. Ordered the turkey sandwich and wildflower salad. Not the best. The turkey was oaky but the bread was to weak to old the sandwich and imploded with the first bite   









Quick service, but very noisy.  It was lunch time and busy  It really was not pleasant to casually eat and chat.  We all ate fast as yelling at each other was not fun. 

Turkey pastrami  on pumpernickel  sandwich. The sandwich had a surprising  \"bite\" to it that Was not anticipated. The balance of meat to salad ratio was good. The potato chips served on the side added an excellent crouch to the meal. Good sandwich. 

Chicken salad sandwich with the wildflower salad. This was just okay. The  garlic flavour overwhelmed the chicken salad and it was awkward to eat as the slice of bread was undersized for the salad. The salad was drowning in dressing as each piece I ate I felt like I was saving it from going under the sea swell of dressing 
  
Buffalo chicken sandwich with the fruit salad.  Overall it was a good sandwich  my daughter would order it again. The only hesitation in ordering again would the level of spice was a lot more then she initially thought it would be. She also felt that  the bread was a little tough. The fruit salad was the best part. The muesli was excellent"}
{"text":"If Denny's can figure out how to serve gluten free bread to their customers....why can't you? I've been asking for over 2 yrs. This has become commonplace Wildflower. Figure it out. 

#thestruggleisrreal 

And they just served me toast on my plate after I explained I can't eat it. #epicfailure and it was the Mgr who brought it after I just got thru asking and explaining about it?! WTH."}
{"text":"I went with a large group of women! They handled this large group great! We can be loud so we sat outside. They did was amazing, I'd never eaten there before . I had a roasted sweet tomato sandwich. It was so delicious and filling I took some home. They have such a huge menu to order from. I had so many choices for drinks also. So I tried a few teas then left with a pumpkin chocolate muffin which was so good I bought 2 more to go. This is a trendy cool clean comfy place to go."}
{"text":"Great place for yummy quick lunch! I'm eating the most amazing salad right now with chipotle poppy seed dressing - WOW! And their tea is fantastic! And the service was super fast, which is important because I was grabbing something fast during work."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Wildflower multiple times.  The good is excellent especially their breads.  The staff are always friendly and always seem to really enjoy being there.  The food items are inventive including the Crisp Unfried Chicken.  Prices are also very reasonable.  Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always good, never can go wrong. Consistent and fresh. Staff is always friendly. Something for everyone, and the BREAD is fabulous."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but for some reason, all the soups seem watered down now. The salads seem to be willty and unedible, i asked for extra mustard and my sandwich was soaked in mustard. I still ate it but dang guys, a little extra, not soaking wet in mustard. 
Anywho, i love the baked good and the ice tea so that keeps it a 4 star. The food needs work, your crew needs work on  putting the food together properly and last but not least, please check the lettuce before you serve it."}
{"text":"Damn. What happened WBC? $11.00+ for a half turkey brie sandwich and way watered down potato cream cheese soup :-("}
{"text":"The light blonde-brown haired women with very long hair made my first time experience horrific! She didn't have a name tag but her bad attitude was obvious. The second she got busy her attitude rose higher. Making huffing noises, swatting food and bags around with such anger it was embarrassing to watch an adult behave this way and extremely uncomfortable watching her handle my food in this manner"}
{"text":"Mmm. The cream cheese and potato soup always perks me up when I'm getting sick, and I love their chocolate chip scones! I've had their ravioli too, they're yummy. Wildflower is homey and consistent!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE! Really nice employees that made my second trip to wildflower awesome! Definitely will be coming back again! Jacob and Kelsie were great! The food was yummy as well!!"}
{"text":"Was 5 stars, now is (merely) 4 stars.  Which means it is still a damned sight better than most other places.  I go here about once a week for over a decade now.  Salads are the stars though sandwiches and baked goods are great too.  They regularly revise their menu which is great when they add some terrific new item but frustrating when that great new item falls of the menu again a few months later."}
{"text":"Solid place.  Great food.  Terrific breakfast and salads.  I like their new meatball sandwich too.

Why only 3 stars?  For 7 years now I've been a giant (figuratively speaking :-) fan of their pumpkin chocolate muffins.   They used to be so yummy and moist.  But everyone of them that I've tried in the past 8 months has been dry.  So frustrating, so disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to go in Tempe. I thought I had written a review here a long time ago. But, I had missed it. So here goes.
I like this place, I do not come here weekly or anything,but every few weeks I stop in.
Lots of parking in this lot,so no problem there.
It is hard to say if I like the Baked goods best or the Salads best!
They have a lot of good selections.
I like some meat on my salad but, they only have chicken or fish. I would rather go for the fish. Because, Chicken is not one of my favorites.
Although they have a Chicken Pomegrantie with Pistachio that could become one of my favorites very fast.
They also sell pasta here, so something for everyone.
The baked goods are really good and always fresh.
It is always clean and the windows sparkle. I do not know why I like that about it , but I do.  It is a great place for dining in or too Gooo~"}
{"text":"Went with here other family members today. Had the Asian a Salad and it was fabulous. Very fresh and the dressing was on the side and fabulous. Hope to return soon this will be on our short list of go to places to eat. Oh, the bread side was out of this world, better than Panara and somehow fresher. No butter needed on this bread."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs, I am in love with the salads, and soup, and breads, and cakes, pretty much everything here! I am hooked like in a good way  : -)"}
{"text":"Normally i go to the location on Baseline Road but today I was a mall rat and I needed a quick dinner fixed to take home with me. I ordered the usual Wildflower Salad. There is something about the lavender in the salad and dressing it is one of my favorite clean-eat choices.

I never came here for dinner... so I tried the butternut squash ravioli with Wild Salmon and it was heaven!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok I know that Wildflower is a chain, but I have to say, it is a very delicious one! This location is in the neighborhood and I often stop in for an iced tea, lunch meeting (they've got wifi!!), loaf of bread for dinner, a salad for lunch, or like yesterday, a delicious breakfast sandwich on a Sunday morning! They've literally got something for everyone.

Their food is fresh, service is fast, and the options are endless. From salads, to sandwiches, to pastas, and delicious soups. One of my favorite things about Wildflower is that they change their menu often, and according to either what is 'trending' in the foodie world or seasonal items. I'm pretty sure that i've tried all of their salads at least once and am never disappointed.

For breakfast, I always get a breakfast sandwich and yesterday's corned beef, swiss, and potato pancake sandwich was TO DIE FOR. My fiance and I BOTH got it and thought that every bite was heaven. This is new to their menu (or at least i've never seen it before) and I will absolutely come back for it again! I think that it would be just as good without the bun as well. 

Thank you for always impressing, Wildflower! I know that i'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Wildflower! It's the type of place to consistently get a fantastic breakfast or lunch. The bread is scrumptious, the desserts fantastic, and the salads to die for.

My standard order for lunch is the Chopped Salad with nine grain bread. I love that you can pick what type of bread comes with your salad. The salmon is always perfectly cooked, and the couscous and dried cranberries really add something extra. For breakfast, I usually go with the Roasted Tomato Feta & Egg Sandwich, which comes on ciabatta bread, or the Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata. The breakfast sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.

They offer two custom iced teas: passion fruit and green tea with guava. Both are delicious. The small drink size is really small, so I typically get a medium even when I dine in.

Yes, it gets busy. Between noon and 1 there is an influx of people from the local offices on their lunch hour. Many people also use the dining area for \"working lunches.\" There are outlets on the bottom of each of the booths, making it great for working on your laptop. If you choose one of these peak times, watch out for table hawks. You know the ones who hover over your table and swoop in to claim their territory. It also makes navigating the maze to the drink station quite a challenge.

Parking can be a challenge, but if you don't mind a little extra walk it's less crazy to park farther away. Wildflower is tucked away in the back corner of a U shaped part of the shopping center at Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101.

The outdoor seating is really quite pleasant, and a great place to bring your pup. On multiple occasions, one of the kind staffers has brought out a water bowl. You can also just ask for a soup bowl when you order. I love the cute umbrellas they added recently! Really helps on the sweltering summer days."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a legitimately good salad in an airport. I tried the Spicy Super Foods salad and it was truly spectacular! The chicken alone is probably the best, juiciest, delicious shredded chicken I've ever had on a salad anywhere. It's hard to do better than this with fast food, and to find it in an airport is even more rare."}
{"text":"The food was great. Big selection. The mixed chips are so good! Kids meals are very big and come with fruit and a cookie and they have whole milk! The seating area is big. The back section was large enough for us with 2 strollers and 2 kids."}
{"text":"Absolutley the slowest place to get a sandwich. Staff just wondering around and nobody really doing anything to get the food out to waiting customers.  Waited already 20 minutes and not 1 person has even paid us any attention.  Keep your money and go eat somewhere that will acknowledge you"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with the professionalism of this company. Received a message from the owner offering a sincere apology and the hopes that I'll be able to find something in the future at Wildflower that wows me. I'll be going back next time my mother and sister decide to go here just because I'm so floored by the quick response."}
{"text":"We searched for Sunday brunch and came up with this place.  It wasn't what I was expecting, which isn't a bad thing at all.  You come in and order from the counter and they deliver it to your seat.  This is not a full service restaurant.

The place was PACKED when we got there but we were lucky to find a table fairly quickly for 6 of us.  Took a long time to decide what we wanted.  The only thing I didn't like is their paper menus were different from what was on the board - meaning, they didn't have everything on the printed menu.  This was confusing and annoying to manage with such a long line and pressure to order.

Aside from that, the food was delicious and the staff were incredibly friendly.  The place was clean, the washrooms were clean and there was plenty of parking.

Great place for a quick, but affordable and high quality meal."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfasts here, but they do a really nice job.  I love the ham and brie frittata.  So simple, but always tastes good.  Every time I eat one I think I could make one at home, but I never do!  The bacon breakfast sandwich is delicious as well with the fresh greens and fluffy bun.  My husband always gets the 2 egg breakfast and enjoys that as well.

For the longest time I forgot they were over here in the mall and we would head to Chompie's.  But now if we feel like a quieter atmosphere in the morning we'll hit Wildflower.  I really need to come back and try the lunch stuff.  It all sounds really good and I love a good soup and sandwich combo.  

The staff is really friendly and helpful here and they have good coffee that will pry my eyes open in the morning.  All in all, it's the simple things done well.  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Location. Location. Location.  ...and then you gotta have good food.  Well this snazzy-yet-inexpensive restaurant served me up the best breakfast I've had outside mom's Sunday fare, for an astonishingly low price.  Not greasy, carefully pan-cooked seasoned potatos and scrambled eggs, and yup, toast CAN be that good.

On approach I thought I was going to an East Coast Panera Bread, or a friendly neighborhood albeit overpriced Paradise Bakery, but then I open the doors to a cavernous living room with a baking problem.  

And if anyone from Wildflower is reading this, can you fix the annoyingly tippy table we sat at outside with one leg missing the rubber pad?  ***UPDATE: Table was fixed promptly the next day!***

Also, they bus the tables there, so just leave your plate where it is when you leave."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor fireplace on the cool winter nights!  It was great, to sit and chat over a hot cup o sumpin'  It would be really nice if there was a small live music jazz trio playing next to the crackling fire pit."}
{"text":"Beautiful sweet potato sandwich and Wildflower salad. Goat cheese yummy! Love the lavender in the dressing too."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service.   Menu understandably a bit limited with restricted space, satisfying nonetheless."}
{"text":"Food is good. Kids meal is good deal, comes with drink and cookie. Sadly the service lags every time. That's the bummer. *located next to Changing Hands bookstore."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always great food and the people who work there are always friendly and helpful.  Esp Love Maria,  I think she knows everyone who comes in and greats them with a happy and joyful smile.  (Arrowhead Store)  There is nothing on the menu that is not great."}
{"text":"3.5 star. Lots of healthy options and fresh ingredients from their sandwiches, salads and soup. Reminds me of a higher-end Panera. We had the following:

Superfood salad- it was flavorful and the different textures really added to the dish. I would have preferred regular corn over the dried one they had. The vinaigrette used wasn't overpowering and just enough for the salad. 

Corn and poblano soup- served warm but not hot enough to my taste otherwise the flavors were ok. I could have had it with a little more heat."}
{"text":"I am so so sad that they took away my very favorite sandwich....

The Cheddar Braised Beef. 

It was the best sandwich there. Savory Beef, Mashed Potatoes, cheese, and Au Jus dip. Now its gone :("}
{"text":"Even though the Pima location is still my favorite.  I had a great time here, too.  After playing in the park with the twins, it was an easy decision to just go across the street and have an early lunch.  My kids love the meatballs, and I liked my turkey ruben very much.  I still wish they would have the long booths as they do at the Pima location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is full of delicious food and an amazing, friendly staff.  This particular location is very well kept and clean including the bathrooms.  We conduct several business meetings here every week and run into other regulars who also favor this spot over the over-crowded and very dirty Paradise Bakery across Baseline.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location is a very nicely decorated and up kept Wildflower Bread Co. Their bakery items are delicious and I love their soups and salads, however this last time my mom ordered the Chopped Salad, a salmon salad which didn't meet expectations. The salad came out with, what we assumed was canned salmon! I've never seen a salad with CANNED SALMON. It's typically grilled. So needless to say the Chopped salad was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is just a terrific store, Samantha and Maya really know how to treat the customer. I won't go into detail but they gave my wife and I great suggestions, service and smiles."}
{"text":"After frequenting this location for over 4 years, I figured it is time to write a little review about how well this location is ran, and the quality of the employees. Being in an extremely busy shopping plaza I wouldn't have been shocked to find this location to have some issues from time to time, as with that much turnover something is bound to give. I'm happy to report that after years of dining here they have kept the highest standards at all levels. The employees are always friendly, the food consistent and tasty, and the atmosphere of the location is alway buzzing with happy diners. If you've spent any amount of time in the valley of the sun, then you've likely been a patron of wildflower, but if this is not the case; you're most definitely missing out. 

Favorite dishes -

The meatball sandwich

Potato cream cheese soup

Cesar salad (best Cesar dressing around)

Chopped salad

I've been eating these same items for years, and they got the spot each time. 

For the figure on a bill of around $30, but the food is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love everything about Wildflower.  The service is always top  notch and the food is great.  Never had any problems and the enviroment is very nice.

I reccomend any dish with their pesto sauce..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not written a review for this Wildflower.  I have been coming to this location for over 8 years, even before their remodel.  Before the twins I used to love hanging out with my hubby on Sunday mornings having breakfast and reading the paper.  That went out the window once the twins came, but I still go for lunch a few times a month.  They have this amazing Chicken, Pistachio Pomegranate salad.  I am hooked on it.  The only thing that is annoying about this place is how busy it gets and how many people hog the big booths.  I have seen so many individuals taking the whole booth just for them and their pc.  They seem to have been there so long, so many of them have their bare feet up on the other side of the booth, yes, I mean you skinny guy on the booth next to me.  I didn't need to see your feet.  EEK."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot! Got a spinach and mushroom frittata when I went, along with their version of a pumpkin spice latte and it was really yummy! It was kind of dead at 7AM, but I'm glad that one of the servers, Kyle, was able to be attentive and also humorous! Definitely gonna try to stop by for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"I Ordered the sweet potato sandwich and liked it a lot.  I'm not sure if it was the sweet potato itself or the fig sauce that tasted so sweet (actually a little to sweet for my preference) but the sandwich had a great flavor & was a reasonably hEalthy option.  I loved that this sandwich was very fresh tasting and made with good quality ingredients.  It was also large enough that I didn't need to order anything else so I saved my chocolate chip scone for later.  I Will be going back!"}
{"text":"If anybody finds a better tasting and healthier soup/s than here, please contact me asap...  :D

I happen to be a soup fan (I said soup, not curry damn it ! ) and this place is something that I always crave about for soups... Roasted Garlic Tomato... ooooo la la....

Sandwiches are good too (except that I have not tried many)... and needless to say that a variety of bread options are enticing... its not a trend here in the States to eat bread dipped in coffee, but if you are willing to try it, this could the the place....  (apart from your own kitchen ofourse !)

Overall a nice and tidy place to have healthy and delicious lunch / brunch and a cup of coffee with bread..."}
{"text":"I work for a large insurance company and often use Wildflower Bread Company to cater lunches and most recently to cater breakfast for 150 people - we did a variety of pastries, muffins, bagels with a beverage cart - it was a HUGE hit!  I can always count on their catering manager, Mishelle, to help me with ideas that maximize my budget.  Delivery is always on time, and packaged smartly and beautifully.  They really are my go-to catering!"}
{"text":"I had to wait a few days to write this because I'm so angry at being duped by these near perfect reviews. Came in at about 2 pm and, while you could still get breakfast, you could not get pasta dishes. It was breakfast or sandwiches - big disappointment. Apparently you can only get pasta after 3 pm. 

I ended up ordering a bunch of random stuff because my planned meal for me and kiddos was foiled. We had the potato soup (pretty average), a chicken parm sandwich (portion small and doesn't come with pasta like the other sandwiches), grilled cheese (average), and pancakes (average). 

The service was lackluster and the restaurant has that smell when you enter a rest home. No thanks. 

I will forever be perplexed as to how this place is categorized as being good. It wasn't anything I couldn't get any where else."}
{"text":"Listed as Vegan.   NOTHING is vegan about this place.  Drove 10 miles out of the way.  When I asked the guy at the counter what was vegan.  He said they vould adapt some salads.  I told him they should not be listed as vegan.  He gave a snotty laugh as he told me he was not in charge of that.  The stupidity thinking I meant him.  Without the smarts to tell the manager or owner that he had a customer come in and leave upset because they were listed as vegan.  
and will probably leave a bad review"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy Cuban and it was alright but the price was high but what can you expect ordering food at an airport. All of the meat was piled in the center so it was kinda annoying to eat. Other than that the staff was super nice and it didnt take long to get my food."}
{"text":"Really good food, cold and hot sandwiches, soups coffee and cold soda drinks.  Pretty pricy $$$ but  than again it's airport.  One thing I didn't like is the fact that guys behind counter were  bit arrogant other wise good food."}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I went out for dinner. I ordered the Wildflower Almond Tuna which I thought was a salad. It was a sandwich. The manager, Frank, was so very kind. He said he would replace it with any salad that I wanted. I ordered the Strawberry Salad. It was delicious. The manager can over and asked was everything. We come to Scottsdale once a year and always need eat here and enjoy the delicious food and the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have been to this location and each time I think they still must be getting their rhythm down since it is a new location.  I LOVE Wildflower and frequent the restaurants often in Chandler and also the Val Vista location.  Always good.   This new location however has been inconsistent at best.  Today I went in for a simple pastry to go - got to work and opened it and it was overcooked/burnt and completely different then the other restaurants.  The texture was off and it was terrible!  Not sure what is happening.... but I hope they get it together soon."}
{"text":"Long line at 12:30 on a Monday, but it moved pretty quickly. Surprisingly this was a problem because I was not entirely sure what I wanted. I decided on the pasta under the assumption they were already serving lunch because well, it's lunch time, and I sat at a table while my mom ordered. It does say they don't serve pasta until 3 pm to close, but first of all why? And second of all, I feel as if it should be a bigger sign anyways. In the end my mom had to rush over to the table and I had to order the grilled turkey pastrami sandwich on a whim, it was satisfactory. Maybe I'll come back some other time for breakfast or at \"lunch\" (early dinner though, am I right?) at 3 pm. The staff was nice though! The tables were cleared off almost immediately. 
More on the sandwich, the only thing I can taste is the coleslaw on top."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. I had the chicken pesto on foccacia bread, which was excellent. The service was good, the sandwich was great, and I really appreciated the free Wifi."}
{"text":"I like stopping here when in need of a meal and driving through Phoenix. It's right at the intersection of the I-10 and the I-17 which is quite convenient.

It can get super busy, but they're pretty efficient. I like the half sandwich deal a lot. The half is still really really big and not too expensive.

I also really like the vegetarian chile. 

I haven't been here for breakfast in forever but their options look really good.

It is a lot like Paradise Bakery, but I like it so so so much more. The sandwiches are just more appetizing. Much better options."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the staff at Wildflower and the consistently good food. Simply stated, they always hit a home run. Fresh salads, great sandwiches and a great selection of hearty soups (my favorite!) and yummy desserts and cookies, 
Bike parking out front is really handy when we're on our weekend bike rides and stop in for breakfast or lunch, plenty of car parking too, so it's really never a problem, unlike some other shopping centers in the area.
Compared to similar restaurants, Wildflower is a friendlier, homier place for me. I think the staff makes the effort to get to know the regulars and to be friendly with all the customers. It is, and will remain, my \"go-to\" place for any meal because of those great qualities: great food, friendliness, cleanliness, and fun. Oh, and Wi-Fi too!"}
{"text":"This Wildflower location has super friendly and attentive staff, is always clean and is the best lunch spot around. I'm a soup lover and they always have a great selection with new choices introduced regularly.  Salads and sandwiches are also really good but I usually stick to soup. Well worth the 7 mile drive from work, I go at least twice a week. I highly  recommend Wildflower for a tasty and healthful meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a spaghetti with marinara and meatballs, which is not an easy order to mess up I might add, and it was Terrible! The marinara was flavorless and they forgot to drain all the water from the overcooked pasta. The meatballs were tasty, but that's the only good thing I have to say about this $10 \"kid's meal\"."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower and am so glad to have one closer to my home! I've dined here twice and both meals were delish! The layout and feel is an updated version of the other locations, with a more causal feel. The chicken pistachio salad is still ridiculously yummy! I did try a turkey sandwich with roasted red peppers that was surpassingly delicious. This will provably become my \"go to\" spot for causal business meetings!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was impressed at how the management at this location addressed the issues I voiced in my earlier review.  Just when I thought customer service was dead, especially at corporate chains, I was shown otherwise. The manager contacted me via Yelp message and offered me his personal cell phone number to discuss my visit (I didn't call, but appreciated the offer).  He also offered me a gift card to come and try the restaurant again.  I took him up on that, and went there yesterday (I tried to check-in on Yelp from their location, but apparently my signal was low in there, and I kept getting an error message).  I had the Chopped Salad again -- this time the arugula was delightfully fresh, as were the other ingredients!  I requested mine without the dried corn this time, and they offered to give me extra of something else.  The salad was great, and was served in a pretty timely fashion, though they were in the middle of lunch rush. Also the tables were cleared quickly once guests left, which was especially good because the place was packed, and otherwise I would have had nowhere to sit.  The server came back right away to wipe the table for me, as promised.   The fresh-squeezed OJ was very good, although the lid was sticky on top.  And since it was over 110 degrees here yesterday, any A/C felt good - so the temperature inside was not a problem.  In fact, it felt perfect.  Overall, a nice lunch experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty yummy.  I like to get a bowl of soup personally or the Pistachio Pomegranate Chicken Salad which is pretty delicious.  Nutritional information is available on their website for the individual items on the menu if you are health conscious.

The service here is okay.  The ice machine is often out of ice and the booths are often dirty as the staff has no time to bus the tables.  I think they are just understaffed a lot.  The staff is very polite and helpful though, but it does get annoying having to grab someone to get a table cleaned so you can sit down to eat.

Check your to go order before you leave.  They tend to give me only a few ravioli with little or no sauce on my to go order for my husband.  This has happened more then once!  For a $10 dish, you would expect a little more.

The Chandler location is open until 9pm on Mon - Sat which is great for those of us who work long hours and have a hard time finding something healthy to eat after work, but are too tired to go home and cook after a long day.

Also make sure to ask for a receipt if you need one as they don't automatically print one for you."}
{"text":"This is a ridiculously trendy place that all the ties come to.

But what matters is that the food is good.

I just didn't particularly like the \"stuffy\" crowd that was there when I went... um, hello, I probably make more than half of you and yes, I'm wearing jeans, so quit acting all high and mighty.  It's just a restaurant, not a club.

Anyway... I had the turkey waldorf salad... EXCELLENT.  Took forever to get the food though... it was jam packed in there.  We even showed up at like 1140 to beat the lunch crew.  The line, when we got there, was out the door.  Took forever to get through the line, took forever to get our food, food was AWESOME when we got it...

But all the stuffiness around us was quite annoying... people hitting your chair and not apologizing because they think they are entitled to hit your chair, and it appears people are not trained in MANNERS these days.

But that's not Wildflower's fault, so I am giving them 3 stars.  Would have been four if the line weren't so long and the cashiers moving at a snails pace and didn't take so long to get the food."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is just \"okay\". 

I got a half sandwich and half soup and I should've taken a pic of my sandwich...It was ridiculous how small the \"half\" was. 

I think these employees have forgotten that it's a CHOICE to spend our money here and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice to find healthy options when having a layover.  They had three ready made sandwich options that all sounded good.  I landed on a pesto, brie, sun dried tomato, and arugula sandwich.  It was perfectly seasoned with just a hint of salt and sweetness from the sun dried tomato.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I felt for the price it was an excellent way to satisfy my hunger.  I'll be back next time through the PHX airport."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now while traveling for work and everything I tried so far has been delicious! Highlights for me include the wildflower salad, the ham & brie frittata and the red, white & blue bread. The employees have always been very friendly. I picked up multiple orders a couple times and they've always been great at packing it all together with utensils and without any mistakes.

The only thing that is a slight negative for me was their V12 kale salad. They had a note that due to kale shortage, they were substituting with a kale/spring mix but my salad barely had any kale in it. I do think the price should be lowered while this substitution is going on. But like I said, this was a minor thing for me. 

Overall, still a fantastic spot to grab a tasty breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC DELICIOUS Airport Meal!
Today I visited Wildflower Bread Company at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, and when I asked, Alex for a suggestion of what to order he suggested getting the pesto chicken with ravioli rather than penne as I was debating these two pastas. He was so kind & helpful, and it was absolutely delicious!!! This meal was prepared / cooked by Bruno, and the waitress who helped me, Samantha, was so sweet, and we chatted about her favorite wildflower meals as well. 
It was one of the most delicious pastas I've ever had. I also frequent the wildflower in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I am always so pleased with my meals there as well! 
The waiters & waitresses at Wildflower are always so friendly, kind, and helpful. I always leave with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"TL;DR - eat here. You'll thank me. Unless you want a burger. 

Also mustard on the side and sub out the bread. There is nothing challah about it IMO. 

-----

You might be traveling to San Francisco from Austin. You might also be hungry and your flight boards in seven minutes.  You would have had forty-five minutes but you prattled on and on and wasted half an hour trying  to decide between modern burger and pizza. 

Pizza or burger. 
Pizza or burger. 

In the end, you chose Wildflower for health reasons (presumably).

Congrats to you!  You care about yourself!

The Wildflower Bakery is an attractive sandwich joint near terminal 4 A7. It's bright, clean and makes you feel like the food you're going to eat was made with love.

And it is. 

Wildflower's baked goods and pre made sandwiches are neatly displayed for you to drool over. The sheen off of the croissants was like a mirage and the chocolate chip pumpkin muffin was calling my name but instead I tried to get the Turkey Brie that I was was denied in Austin.

Because I was leaning towards the BLT+ I decided, \"choose?  We are in GD America!  We get what we want in America,\" so I added bacon to my Turkey Brie. 

-----

Food: everything was tasty but I would definitely suggest holding off on the mustard. Even though it was good mustard, it overpowered bother the Brie and the Bacon making their presence worthless. In the end, they will go straight to my thighs anyway. (What's a girl to do?)

I'd definitely try their other sandwiches but I'd be more guarded.

In fact, I'd definitely ditch their default bread for anything else. 

Up your game by going for a croissant."}
{"text":"The Wildflower Chopped Salad is to die for!  Imagine healthy eating at the airport waiting for your plane..."}
{"text":"I love this place too!  Sure it is a chain, but everything they have is wonderful.  I mostly go there to pick up breakfast I really love the Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata it has eggs, ham, brie, sauteed apples, sage and leeks, served with Wildflower Home Fries and buttered toast... so yummy.  There soups are very good and so are the sandwiches that I have tried.  As for the pasta dishes my favorite is the butternut squash ravioli... to die for!  Also at this particular location they sell certain items by the quart like their soups and meatballs with sauce and it is a good option if you are looking to make a quick pasta dinner."}
{"text":"clean environment, healthy food, it's an order at the register kind of place then they bring it to you kind of place so you dont have a server but have a condiment station by the drink fountains. ultimately the food is the star here and it s really good."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had been waiting in line at the mod pizza next door with 1 person in front of us for 20min and decided to leave and go to wildflower and we are glad we did! We had one person in front of us again and were helped within minutes by a gentleman who said it was his last day. We all started conversing for a bit and he said he wanted to be super kind on his last day and he didnt charge us for our drinks or sides! When our sandwhiches came they were absolutly delishous. Very light and didnt make us feel sick or heavy stomached. Definitly going to be going back :)


*Bonus: very good customer service and satisfaction they reached out to me in recognition of being a fan. Thank you wildflower :)"}
{"text":"The chicken Asian salad is the best thing you can order. When ever I'm craving a salad I come here! The also have amazing sandwiches and soup. If you are looking for a fast causal place to go this is the place for you! It's also not too expensive. If you like Panera you will love wildflower!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The soups are one of the best and the sandwiches are really good too. My favorite thing to order is a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake, which I think is only seasonal but get it while you can. Sometimes I come here to study. The ambiance is great and 5 notches above your average Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is like a much much better Panera bread. Great food -- great value- without exception. We have gone here many times during visits to Sedona."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for lunch as we were 'on our own' for lunch on my recent visit. I had the Turkey Breast & Brie and he had the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. I must admit when I saw his sandwich I was jealous and unsure of mine, but alas - they were both delicious! 

Well, actually I never got to taste his because he didn't share, but it looked amazing and he didn't speak much so we'll say that he agrees. 

We were here at an off-peak time on a Friday so it wasn't crowded and the wait wasn't very long to get our food. I think it's a great gourmet sandwich place with bakery items and coffee which is a great  alternative to fast food and the couple of restaurants in the center.  I'm sure the locals who work in the area frequent it often!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and the layout of the restaurant is such a European aesthetic. Perfect for a casual lunch with friends or family when out shopping. Love it!"}
{"text":"Wildflower offers a healthy, price competitive alternative to the ho-hum sandwich and soup guys!

This past Saturday, after running around, we decided to take a break and have a lite dinner.  We arrived a little after five, having debated if we wanted to go to Paradise Bakery.  

Paradise is not our favorite soup and salad place, because of the ever diminishing portions.  I'm waiting for them to downsize the chocolate chip cookie next!  

For some reason, we always forget about Wildflower.  It's mostly because of its location, parking and access from FLW and Northsight.  Probably not the best reasons, I know.  As always, we enjoyed the food and it wasn't crowded that night.  

We both believe the Wildflower's Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate Salad is wonderful!  It's has shredded Chicken breast served on top of some Arugula, with feta, oranges, olives, red peppers, red onions & toasted pistachios with a Pomegranate Vinaigrette, all for $8.29

We also had the Rare roast beef, gorgonzola, roasted red pepper, red onion, romaine, tomato and herb mayo on Sourdough bread that they advertise as 94% fat-free for $7.49. I love anything with gorgonzola cheese.  So much nicer than blue cheese!

In summary, our bill came to $21.74 with both the salad and sandwich being delicious, with some unique flavors and tastes that linger.  We also bought some bagels for breakfast.  Nice.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic bakery to come to if you are looking for healthy \"quick\" food.  What I mean by quick is you pay up at the cashier first, then you receive your food, omitting the standard waiter to table type of restaurant.  

I personally love that Wildflower is committed to offering healthy, fresh prepared food without the use of hormones or antibiotics in their meats.  One of the reasons I eat here is because they list all their ingredients and allergens on their website.  Not many restaurants do this, but it makes it so much easier to order straight off the menu  especially if you are like me and cannot eat dairy.  Some dairy free items that I like here are (omit the cheese and Vienna bread):  the Almond Tuna Sandwich, BLT Plus Sandwich, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Pasta Primavera.  Amazingly enough they offer one dessert that is not made with dairy or butter and that is the Chocolate Palmier, yum!

One complaint:  You may not get a seat if its at lunchtime.  I have to arrive here right at 11am to grab a booth, otherwise you might be standing up to eat your dish during lunch."}
{"text":"Always great food and staff give A+ customer service.  I came in close to closing and ordered coffee with my meal.  The coffee wasn't hot enough to enjoy so they offered to give me a refund AND make me a specialty coffee drink on the house. It was clear the staff were empowered to care and make things right without checking with someone first.  Just a few reasons why we make Wildflower one of our routine places to eat.  Love the braised cheddar beef sandwich offered in the winter months!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant for lunch for a long time.  My favorite item on the menu is the 1/2 and 1/2 Continental Chicken sandwich with a caesar salad.  This sandwich comes with carmelized onions and some kind of horseradish sauce which gives it just the right kick.  I also love their soups.  It's a nice atmosphere for lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Had an amazing chop salad. Franke came to my table very sweet man overall great food atmosphere and service I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place and find the overall ambience and food to be very enjoyable, although it's generally very crowded around the lunch hour.  I stopped here for lunch today at 12:00pm on the dot.  It was packed, very loud with about five to seven people in line.  Fortunately the line moved fairly quickly since I was starving.  

I'm on a low carb diet, which limits my food options in general.....why I'm having lunch at a place known for their homade bread doesn't make much sense!  I must like torture!!!  Well, I stick to the diet and order the grilled chicken ceasar salad to go.  I've eaten this salad at leat five or six times and always enjoy the tangy dressing, freshly grated parmesean cheese and nice portion of grilled chicken, along with the addition of sauteed mushrooms.  It also includes homemade croutons and two HUGE slices of freshly baked sourdough!  I was, again, able to avoid temptation!!!  This time the salad was just not that good...it had too much dressing, not enough lettuce and a smaller portion of chicken.  I should have gone with the hummus plate which is still fairly low carb as it's served with grilled vegetables.

I have stopped here for breakfast from time to time and have really enjoyed the frittatas and breakfast sandwiches (pre low carb era).  It's nice to be able to sit in a comfy chair and read the newspaper while enjoying the food.  Overall, I think Wildflower is pretty good at what they do.  They sure know how to pack in the crowds :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite office spot in the city. Free wifi all day, friendly staff, yummy food, and all the coffee, tea, and soda you can drink. Their army of half-booth two-tops lets laptop denizens like me camp out all day in a comfy seat without taking the four-top booths from the other customers. The clientele tends to be mellow and quiet--with lots of business lunches and dates-with-elderly-mom going on during the day. Did I mention plugs at every table? This place is a freelancer's dream. Love these guys! (P.S. eat the carrot cake.)"}
{"text":"Customer service rep Samantha was very helpful she even offered to pay for my food due to me not liking a random selection i choose. Very great service, i did reject the offer but that just shows you Samantha is willing to go above and beyond . These are the type of employees every company should be thankful to have. Btw the location store number was 17 at terminal 4."}
{"text":"Get the bread it's amazing kale salad very disappointed no dressing tough might be good tomorrow if I let it sit."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been to the Scottsdale location and the food was awesome. As a family we order the same breakfast every time we go and even though its a different location the quality of the food is the same as we are used to which is great. Larger location with more seating and the same great food how can you go wrong. We now added this location to our rounds since it's across the street from the McCormick Stillman Railroad Park we frequent with the kids and they also Donate to the park which is awesome. Keep it up guys your doing great."}
{"text":"A friend asked me to stop in here for breakfast one morning and I'm so glad he did. This place is AMAZING!!! Very glad I found it. Food is fresh and delicious, coffee is great, I would change nothing. I now stop by once a week with my family for breakfast on a regular basis and wish I could every morning. Such great food and an awesome staff, definitely worth checking out if you have never been."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I wish they had these out in California! I found this place by chance, since I was just in town for a wedding. I am head over heels in love with the Rosemary Chicken Linguine pasta. It was so good I told my boyfriend I was leaving him for that dish. I went back for more the very next day, and I was so impressed, both by the dish, and the employees' hustle, and kindness. I know how stressful the dinner rush can be, but they seemed so personable, and were so welcoming to each guest even though they had so much to do. I would trade every single Panera Bread location in this state for a Wildflower Bread Company. I MISS YOU!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but I don't understand how I can come in and order 2 soups to go with only one person ahead of me and it takes 20 minutes."}
{"text":"A great spot for dinner salads.  I didn't love my Cobb salad but the Asian chicken salad is bigger and tastier.  I found the soup too salty but the samdwhich was great and full of veggies as well."}
{"text":"PANCAKES.

No really, I didn't get much else here, but the service is great and the whole place reminded me of Panera Bread except ... I think cheaper. Much cheaper. This is a chain, and they have some pretty great baked goods like the banana walnut bread that comes with your order of sandwiches.

I, of course, went for the short stack of pancakes. The banana walnut pancake was pretty on point and hit the spot for my carb-tastic cravings. The service is extremely friendly and overall atmosphere is relaxing. Definitely a great spot to hang out or grab a casual meal."}
{"text":"5 stars? Yes! This is by far the best airport food I've had. I had the quinoa salad and the potato soup and my partner had the turkey BLT sandwich. Like most everyone has mentioned before it was really great to have a healthy option that was tasty. The potato soup could have been better, however I was pretty obsessed with my salad. Additional plus, they were quick with orders. I had 7min to catch my flight and I totally managed to get my food on time though there was a lengthy line."}
{"text":"God, I miss Panera Bread.  That said, this place is a distant second.  It's soups and salads are very good.  The sandwiches are consistent and good for a casual lunch.  Bakery is ok."}
{"text":"I love this location!! The staff is so friendly and they will literally customize any order to your heart's desire. The food is great and the atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good luv their soup and sandwiches.  I wish they had one of these in my hometown"}
{"text":"Anthony is fantastic.  We came for lunch during peak Sunday hours, and he handled our 5 top with 4 seniors with grace and professionalism. He is friendly and fast, and he seems like he's having a good time. My mom says, \"He's  a gem!\""}
{"text":"Tristen was very friendly and remembered our conversation that that we had with him from over 4 months ago. I really appreciated him remembering us and our conversation. Food was good and hot! We waited no more than 3 minutes to get our food. Almost every employee asked if we need anything and if it was good. They were all happy and kind."}
{"text":"Our first stop on our Arizona vacation.  Very much like Panera bread back east.  Clean and easy to find.  The staff was very helpful with suggestions for a first timer.  Everyone was friendly and professional.  Food was delicious and delivered a few short in minutes from ordering."}
{"text":"Wow - we shared a tuna sandwich and quinoa salad and both we're DELICIOUS !  Service and coffee was fresh and superb."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the restaurant has great food. My husband and I go there pretty often for brunch or a quick lunch. Their fresh homemade bread is amazing and their chocolate chip scones are to die for!"}
{"text":"Food is always wonderful at these restaurants if you like fresh which my husband doesn't. (Weird, I know!!) 
Service was a little slow but everyone was friendly. It's a little out of our way so we won't come to this location often but I would if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower Bread Company! I'm completely addicted to the pistachio chicken salad. Occasionally I'll detour and try something different, like the turkey sandwich with bell peppers which is also delish, but I always go back to my favorite salad. I love that they have green and black tea options for this of us who don't drink coffee or soda.  Service is friendly too!"}
{"text":"The new Kale salad is to die for! 
I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, prompt service. Clean restaurant. Coffee good. Bagels not so much. The Asiago Cheese bagel had no flavor or appearance of cheese. It was boring. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Our usual Wildflower is the one in Goodyear. We went there a lot when we were dating and we make a trip back when we're in the area. This time, we were much farther away and spotted this place before we drove back to Tucson. 

We ordered a salad, a soup in a bread boulle, a blueberry muffin, and a chocolate cupcake. The salad and soup were great, the muffin okay, and the cupcake...ick. The cake part is nice, but it had been years since I've ordered one at Wildflower and I instantly remembered why. The icing in both flavor and texture is exactly like a can of Pillsbury icing. For almost $3, I expected something better. 

We got our food quickly though and sat in the back nearest the bathrooms. Our kids are both under a year old, so this seemed the best place considering everyone else dining there. We'd probably go back if we're on that side of town, but next time we'll skip the dessert."}
{"text":"Other than being a little overpriced on some of their items, it's really good food. 

I've tried the pesto linguine, fettucine with marinara, grilled cheese with tomato and arugula, linguine with alfredo sauce, caesar salad, their chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, and their chocolate chip scone. 

The overall price for two adults (with medium drinks) is always about $20. 

I wouldn't go there all the time, but every now and then I get a craving for their bread they serve with all their pastas or one of their cupcakes."}
{"text":"This locations customer service is top notch!! I love coming here and giving them business, customer service is huge to me as a customer. I love many different items on the menu, there is something for everyone and they have good portions unlike many of their competitors that charge the same price for far less."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, a cup of french onion soup and a chopped salad. When I arrived the salad was all mixed up and did not look pretty so the cashier went out of his way to have a new one made for me and man it was delicious!! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was so glad to find a cafe that offers healthy meals using super fresh ingredients right in the airport terminal!  It certainly brings a breath of fresh air to airport dining scene.  Everything is made fresh that day including the bread, sandwiches, salads and soups!  All at a good price point.  I ordered the basil mozzarella panini and a side of quinoa salad.  They were both delicious and the fresh ingredients made a huge difference.  The service was excellent as well!  Overall, I highly recommend this cafe if you're looking for reasonably priced fresh and healthy dining options at the airport!"}
{"text":"This is a very bright, clean and cheery place with a friendly efficient staff.  Wonderful breads and soups,  The half sandwich and soup combos are a favorite and you will enjoy whatever version you order.  The breakfasts are also excellent.  Be prepared to wait for a table at peak hours, since many others have already found this place!"}
{"text":"great food! service was ok, the cashier or waiter/waitress aren't too friendly, the food does takes a while to come out, one time out food takes 30 then so i manage to ask whats taking so long, turns out they never put the order in, so the owner or manager came out to talk to us he was so nice and apologetic.  he gave us a full refund on our meal and rush our order to come out first, he also gave us a $15 gift card for next time.... i still like this place even there are lil mistake here and there,what can i say bribery works hehe..."}
{"text":"I hesitated coming back to this location but it was the closest to our events that day. Service was much better today,possibly because it was Mother's Day. The food, as always, was high quality. My husband enjoyed his Asian salad, the Lon ricotta pancakes had a delicate lemon flavor that was good, although obscured if you put syrup or strawberries on them. Probably would prefer simply with whipped cream. The chicken pomegranate salad was excellent."}
{"text":"What I have come to expect. Actually there are some things on this menu I get a real craving for. Their pastas are so flavorful and the integrity of the dish does not diminish when you take it 'to go'.

The salads and soups taste so fresh. And the sandwiches are so jam-packed with flavor and ingredients that one is not left feeling hungry.

Every time I go I have to pick up a fresh loaf of sourdough. It makes THE best sandwiches (make a late night grilled cheese and tell me just how yummy it is!) or side to a great bowl of pasta or soup.

Try the iced tea. Delish!"}
{"text":"I love this location and the staff. I stop in after any appointment I have up that way. The food is always great, the staff is top notch. Only gripe is the parking at busy times, but that can't be helped."}
{"text":"I was staying across the street at the Plaza Resort and stumbled upon this place when I was driving around looking for a breakfast place other than Starbucks. It kinda reminds me of a fancier version of Panera Bread. Their prices are reasonable and the food is good. I had their stuffed french toast, sausage & egg sandwich, egg breakfast and parfait. Service was friendly but just a tad bit slow. Overall, I was happy and so were my kids. Oh yeah, and they offer free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Yet another update: fully expected them to be out of seafood chowder because I didn't get a chance to go by until after 3:00. Guess what? They still had some!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, it's fresh, tasty and consistent. They have GF and lots of choices for picky eaters. Late morning you can get breakfast and lunch...which I like because I bring my church here once a month and everyone can have what they want. 

The staff moves around from time to time to other locations, but they're all very customer service oriented. 

This location especially is highly recommended! The dining room is large and there's outside seating too. Parking in front gets tight but there are plenty of spots nearby."}
{"text":"One of the best choices at Sky Harbor!  Trying to eat plant strong (super easy while traveling, she says sarcastically) and they have the BEST options: quinoa vegetable salad and tonight they offered a fantastic vegan cauliflower masala!  I would cross terminals to eat here!!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more Wildflowers then Paneras!!  This place is the best! I love everything they have. Give Wildflower your business!!"}
{"text":"My  wife loves  the banana  pancakes me and the kids go here on mothers day and get them for breakfast in bed. Makes her day."}
{"text":"Wildflower was okay.  It reminds me a lot of Paradise Bakery (if you put me inside one or the other it would be hard to tell the difference).  I'm not a big fan of Paradise, either, but I figured I'd give Wildflower a try.  The sandwich I had was a hot pot roast kind of thing (I can't remember the name and they no longer offer it).  The ingredients themselves were all fairly good, but brought together, it sounded more like a garage band than a symphony.

I think they try to do a bit too much with their menu and try to throw together a bunch of vaguely fancy or artisanal sounding ingredients just for the sake of the name of the final product.  Honestly, with some of the menu items it seems like someone came up with an item name, thought it sounded fancy and unique, and then worked on building a sandwich to fit the name.  It'd be like coming up with a great movie title then building a convoluted plot to fit the title: it's going in the wrong direction.

So, basically, it seems like their menu is overly complex.  There's nothing wrong with having a dozen ingredients on a sandwich if they go together, but just stuffing whatever sounds pleasant on a sandwich doesn't always work.  Plus, their sandwiches are made to order.  That's not a bad thing, but when you have so many ingredients on a sandwich, the sandwich will sometimes benefit from being wrapped and chilled for a bit to give the flavors some time to marry (so the sandwich works as a unit and not as a bunch of layers fighting for attention on the palate).

I may go back and try it again.  Frankly, this isn't my kind of place, but there are some other things I wouldn't mind trying.

If you like Paradise, you'll probably like this place.  I don't like Paradise, so maybe it has ruined this kind of restaurant for me.

Between the two, go to Wildflower.  They seem to be pretty much the same, but at least Wildflower is a local chain and not a regional/national chain."}
{"text":"Salmon chopped salad must be one of the best salads I have ever had. It's the perfect size. It's got a variety of ingredients and the flavor is just right. There is not too much of one thing. Too bad I live in California or this would be a go to lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"I love their soup,salad and scone!!
They are so friendly and care about customer!
You should stop by,if you are in PHX airport!"}
{"text":"All things considered, I put this place even with Paradise Bakery as far as a solid lunch place with good sandwiches and salads.  Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.  In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.

Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.

Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.

My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.

I would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, decent prices and good food.  Solid lunch spot.  However, I hate this location.  It gets uber busy on weekends and is a hassle.  I hate driving around this horribly designed shopping plaza on a normal day but on the weekends it is even worse.  There is really nothing wrong with this Wildflower except for the location.  I'm going to stick to the one on Indian Bend.  Its much roomier.  Anyway, the Fiery Butternut Squash salad is awesome as is their chopped salad.  They are some of the best salads in town."}
{"text":"Visited today and had ones of the kindest gestures I've ever experienced in terms of a restaurant experience. 
Nancy helped me and was wonderful. I say GO! Their soups are delicious and their chopped salad is divine!"}
{"text":"I returned yesterday for lunch and the food and customer service was just as great as the first time. Wildflower is officially my new favorite place for healthy and fresh prepared meals."}
{"text":"A nice place to go for English Breakfast tea and THE BEST CRANBERRY SCONES anywhere! I've been to a lot of cafes that serve scones, none can compare. it tastes even better warm. It's texture is like crossing a buttery southern-style biscuit with the density of pumpkin bread that is not too sweet. Hey Wildflower, thanks for having the lemons wedges in easy reach, avoiding the need to request them after order a cuppa."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Wildflower Bread Company for as long as I can remember. I'm a huge fan of their half/half, half soup and half sandwich. I always get the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola and whatever soup looks best on their soup board for the day.

Never had bad soup, never had a bad sandwich. Their food is GOOD! Don't come here around 12-1, it gets packed and seating can be tough. They do have seats outside if you can't find one inside. 

Don't forget to get yourself a treat at their bakery area, yummy! I've had a muffin there before, they are so good. I just make it a point to ignore all the delicious sugary treats."}
{"text":"Went in to Wildflower on Monday and ordered a Caesar salad and potato cream cheese soup, Gaige was so helpful and nice!! Was very friendly and talkative, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sour Dough Bread Boule with Cream Cheese Potato Soup!  Yumm Yum!  I love the fact that this unit is NOT at a mall.  It is accross the street from a upscale strip mall.  Food was Great (but they burnt my friends bread boule.)  Service was excellent.  Young men and women working, but super nice and accomidating.  I asked for three soup samples and they were busy!  (They had three registers a ringing.)  Great people watching.  I saw an old cougar, a wicked (plastic surgry nightmare) stepmom, and a few other interesting people.    The  breadboule was cheap.  Under six bucks."}
{"text":"Great food . Good and fast service. Their breakfast is amazing and they serve it until 2pm on weekends"}
{"text":"The Best Sandwich!!
New for the fall is the Cranberry Turkey Stuffing sandwich.  OMG. My family could eat one for every meal.  My husband met a friend at the restaurant and they both order the sandwich.  Then on the same day my husband asked if I could get another one for dinner that same night.  My husband is not a sandwich eater....until this one came along.  We are having friends over for lunch tomorrow and guess what?  All requested that we order the same Cranberry Turkey Stuffing sandwich.  And the bacon on it is a plus.  I also ordered some of the pumpkin muffins for dessert.  Delicious.  The staff is friendly, service is awesome, and Wildflower is one of my favorite lunch places.  Has been for years."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome the food is great & the service is always fantastic ; and such a beautiful decor , this location at chandler mall is the best I always enjoy coming here  I come regularly and highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"It is very sad to know that you close before your posted closing times on Sundays. We came in just before 8:00 on Sunday night. Two young men told us that they were already closed. I think they just wanted to go home early. I'm a loyal customer and being pregnant I was really craving a salad. I'll think twice before returning to this location."}
{"text":"It's like Panera, but better. Came here a few times when we were visiting for spring training. For breakfast, we all really enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes. Not overwhelmingly cheesy or lemony, simple yet tasty. The blueberry compote is the perfect sweetness to match the light acidity of the pancakes. Delicious.  Also, the walnut banana pancakes are quite good, as is the banana bread. 

The frittata, however, was not very good. A little overcooked and extremely earthy.  The staff was kind enough to refund the frittata, however.  In addition, depending on how busy they are, the wait time for the food can be a while. We waited over 20 minutes for our breakfast, and then it came out separate. Since this isn't really a sit down place, that seemed like a long time to wait."}
{"text":"Food is good but I always stick to my main ones: (breakfast) sausage & cheddar cheese sandwich on ciabatta bread and banana-walnut pancakes. Delicious! service is good too!!"}
{"text":"I always look forward to going out to dinner with my girlfriends here.  I really really really like the roasted sweet potatoe sandwhich, the vegetarian soups, the garlic lemon penne and the butternut squash ravioli.  I have tried the hummos plate and it was just so so.  I went for breakfast once and was impressed as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast this weekend and grabbed a table outside with our dog.  The dining room is really nice, the staff was very friendly, the menu is extensive and the food was quite tasty.  I enjoyed a roasted tomato and feta breakfast sandwich with a blood orange limeade.  I look forward to coming by again for dinner to try one of the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Very very good!  The kale potato soup is fresh an yummy and the sweet potato sandwich is great."}
{"text":"Chipotle egg sandwich was great. Fresh, tasty and quite healthy. The pumpkin soup was also very good.  Coffee, however, was disappointing. I ordered Americana, which is the true test of the unmasked coffee quality. Their coffee was way too weak, similar to MacDonald quality, not anything like that of a good coffee house (but priced the latter)."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at a Wildflower Bread Company. I've been in the Valley for a year now but assumed it was just another Panera or Paradise Bakery and never bothered to venture in. On a whim I made a last minute decision to grab lunch there and loved it! The atmosphere was wonderful and even though the place was full for a Sunday lunch it didn't seem too loud or overwhelming. The selection was more interesting than Panera. I chose an open faced Chicken Parm sandwich. The homemade marinara was incredibly flavorful and I enjoyed the added touch of mushrooms and arugula. Normally Chicken Parm that isn't breaded tastes dry and dull but this was the opposite!

My only complaint would be that they have a delicious looking pasta menu that doesn't start until 3. I originally wanted to order the Herb Linguini but it was only 12:30. I didn't see that listed on their menu anywhere and it would be helpful to have that listed. 

On my way out I saw some amazing looking bagels. I ended up getting some, but they didn't have a dozen deal listed anywhere. It would be nice to have a dozen price listed instead of just $1.29 each. They're delicious enough that I'll still come back for more! Definitely recommend it for anyone on any sort of diet or who has dietary restrictions as well."}
{"text":"I stopped into wild flower bread the other day for lunch even though many Co workers had warned me about lengthy wait times during busy hours. When  I arrived I knew what they meant because it was busy as could be! Kaylee helped me at the register to pick out something that fit with my dietary needs and she let me know ahead of time that it may be a few minutes longer than usual due to the amount of business. I got a number and sat down once I found a seat, moments later the same girl delivered my food and apologized for the wait (I hadn't even noticed because it took so long to find a seat) The food was delicious, the service from Kaylee was superb and she checked back on me again before I left! I will be back for sure and hopefully bring some of my coworkers. They are missing out!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go eat. It's always my go to suggestion when the group can't decide on where to go! Everyone that works here is always so friendly and the food has never disappointed. I usually get the BLT plus sandwich or potato cream cheese soup in a bread bowl, but decided to try out the buffalo chicken sandwich today. It was sooo good! I'm going to start trying all the different things on the menu because I doubt any will be bad lol beware though, it does get pretty packed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Wildflower Bread Company is as good as it gets indeed!!!  After I wrote my review, I got an email from the founder, Louis, who was very concerned about my review and he indicated that a remedy would be in place to correct the issue.  This is what is called, good Customer Service!!!  Along with this, came a refund in the mail for the meal ordered and a gift card to give Wildflower another chance.  I haven't had the opportunity to return to Wildflower as yet and will make my way there one of these days and see how much improved the service is.  Thank you Mr. Basile for taking the time to read and listen to my review.  You are a person of good character and value what consumers have to say about your business...  Best."}
{"text":"Went later in the evening and was pleasantly surprised by the items available and the customer service.  Carrot cake, double chocolate cake, cinnamon roll and broccoli cheddar soup all delicious!  The cinnamon roll was especially tasty. Very comfy and clean.  Beautiful outdoor seating area too.  I'll be back for breakfast and the salads look awesome too!"}
{"text":"When I go here I always look forward to when I can go back.  I enjoy the bread bowls of soup, the sandwiches, the pasta- Butternut Squash and Garlic Lemon Penne are my favorites.  I also like the new flavored lemonade they have and the iced coffee.  I have never like the desserts though."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and staff is friendly. I've been visiting this location for over a year. Food typically takes a while so I always order to pick up for lunch. Even ordering ahead a lot of the times ends up taking 10-15 minutes just to pay and pick up because there's always one cashier. I'd love if they started having a pick up order line for those of us that need to get in and out quickly for lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in this morning before our flight back East for the holidays and had a great experience.  The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly, the menu was extensive and the food was good.  I enjoyed a half turkey, tomato and brie sandwich with a bowl of spicy chicken enchilada soup and my husband had the ham and egg breakfast sandwich with fruit - all quite good.  It makes the experience even better when the entire staff seems to enjoy what they are doing even when they are working on Christmas Eve!"}
{"text":"There's always a very sweet and nice boy working behind the counter when I come in here late at night, I don't think I've ever been underwhelmed by anything I've ever gotten, I love their chop salad, and I pretty much tried almost all of their soups which never failed me. Don't skimp on getting a pastry either,  because you can walk next-door and buy a really cheap book and sit outside on the patio and eat your pastry in peace."}
{"text":"We had THE BEST traditional pancakes we've ever had here! It was definitely the most fluffy, too! So delicious!! The traditional french toast was amazing as well! Great service, friendly staff! Next time we're in AZ, this will be a mandatory stop for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place.
Beautiful ambiance
Wonderful Service
Delicious food
Amazing pastries

What else could we ask for?"}
{"text":"Brandon was so helpful to me- I wandered in not knowing what I wanted and he walked me through the whole menu without making me feel rushed. He even let me try a couple of soups and dressings! A+ Customer Service I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My husband and kids love this place, super friendly staff , their sourdough rolls are amazing ."}
{"text":"Thank you sooooo much for having one of your locations at the airport.  What an oasis in an otherwise food desert of fast food.  I've always heard that Phoenix airport offered better tasting food options and your restaurant confirmed this.  I generally change planes in Dallas....well not any more.  A great tasting salad with Quinoa, good dressing and other tasty morsels was nirvana to stumble upon.  The young man who assisted me was polite, helpful and friendly.  And the roll that came with the salad was also yummy.  I'm very grateful to you.  As someone who eats primarily organic foods traveling is a huge challenge to me and unless I pack my own lunches from home, I'm usually hungry when I travel.  Hats off to a great company thinking outside the box."}
{"text":"I really like this place again. Ten years ago I was a fan but it went downhill and I stopped going. I tried it again about 2 years ago and have been back many times since. They have great pastries, espresso drinks, and main breakfast items. Lunch is great too with bread bouls optional for the daily soups and a few unusual fare items. I really liked their tomato bread salad which they have discontinued but they still have a lot of different salads. I have also been to the WBC near 44th St and Indian School - same menu. I usually try to go off hours to avoid the lines and filled booths. You can call ahead for take out."}
{"text":"The soup and service are consistently great. I love how varied their menu is, but I tend to always get the Wildflower grilled cheese which has Brie, arugula, tomato and cheddar on it. The only thing  missing with that would be a nice glass of white wine, of course. This particular location is a little small, but the food and service is consistent with what I am used to!"}
{"text":"Beware do not order take out from this location. The last three times we have ordered from this location either something is forgotten, poor quality, or completely wrong. 

We tried a couple times thinking it was just a fluke because they are so busy but it is the standard."}
{"text":"We discovered this place in June while I was in the hospital directly across the street from it.  My spouse would pickup dinner and bring it to me because you know how bad hospital food can be!  We have been hooked ever since.  Even though it is a drive for us, it is well worth it.  The sammies, salads and soups are delicious.  On 12/10/17 I picked up lunch and was helped by Jacob.  He was professional, helpful and really knew the menu.  Our food was fresh and tasted amazing.  I ordered quite a bit, and I appreciated the fact that the person who brought out our food double checked each item with me to ensure we had everything.  Can't say enough good things about WBC."}
{"text":"The customer service received from Pat is beyond feeling individualized in a busy establishment.  Pat made a day sunshiny bright and impactful people like her have no idea how the little customized things mean so much :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Fresh coffee and pastry! I had a regular in-house coffee and a chocolate croissant!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, smells awesome when u walk in the door. Looks very nice inside, decor is on point. The staff is very friendly, an easy to order new age type of design. The bathrooms are very clean an nice even free lotion samples, looks new an fresh. Great selection of foods an comfy booths. Looks like they are nicer to animals cage free / antibiotic free. Who knows if it's true I didn't eat meat ways. The food is awesome had pasta and soup /w bread bowl. 5 stars all the way!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times over the years. New faces come and go,this visit today was ok. Cashier was friendly and attentive, that is about as far a it went besides good food. A man in a white company tee shirt was cleaning the ice machine spout, hard to get ice and drinks when things are torn apart. Maybe that should be a job for closing when no customers are around, unless it's broken.  Same man as above was reprimanding kitchen staff loud enough it could be heard by those close enough to the kitchen. The staff that delivers food were pleasant when bringing food. They was three(2 girls 1 male)of them standing chatting about schedules and how they didn't like something about the schedule. The young man came into work chewing on what appeared to be a straw. He chewed on it for several minutes while cleaning tables. 
Food was good as usual. I do miss the mixed grill sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried the new macaroni and cheese with Chorizo, very tasty and a great addition to their menu. Frank was very nice and super helpful. Thanks Frank!"}
{"text":"Time after time, this place delivers great food and exceptional service. The Seville location is sunny open warm inviting all day and into the evening. My favorites - of course the sourdough ! But rosemary sea salt is unmatched for flavor !!"}
{"text":"I have going there at least 1 per week and have been the biggest fan!

HOWEVER

Their quality has been going DOWN DRAMATICALLY. I ordered the same salad 4 times in a row, which is  my favorite on their menu. EACH TIME, it was missing a new element, either they did not put any cheese in it, or put half of the bread it's supposed to come with, or lacking some of the veggies.

Their portions have gone smaller.
It's unfortunate that to save money they are trying to rip off people by small changes that are supposed to go unnoticeable, such as repetitively not putting cheese, which is the most expensive part of the salad, and not telling their clients. 

They also have advertised a vegetarian chili which had full chunks of chicken in it.

I am SO DISAPPOINTED that my favorite eating place in town is becoming one that I would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was efficient, and prices were reasonable. I had the blueberry something lemonade - to me it tasted just like regular lemonade, but it was good regular lemonade.  I ate the butternut squash ravioli; the walnuts and baking spices were an interesting touch of flavour, although I'd probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"I tried the summer garden salad and I loved it. The great service from people like Jenna make this place though! Great atmosphere and great food! Yumm"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their sandwiches but I'm going to have to skip their soups. This last French onion soup tasted like they left a little bit of their Italian wedding soup in it and mixed it altogether. Just disappointing was very bland and watery tasting. And they also have great pastries can't knock that :-)"}
{"text":"Today was my first vist to this restaurant. We went at noon on a Saturday, and yep it was crowded. Fortunately I managed to snag a table while the hubs ordered for us. I got the roast beef w/Gorgonzola on sourdough, he got a Reuben, and my 3 year old got a grilled cheese on sourdough. The sandwiches come with a side of red potato salad which I tried first. Oh em YUM! I think this is probably the best potato salad I have ever had. And I've had a lot of potato salads. I don't know what they use in it, but it had kind of a sweet flavor. The sandwich was pretty good too. The sourdough had a crust that was so tough, I had to pull on it with my teeth for what felt like an eternity, while the rest of the fillings fell out. This isn't a horrible thing, but it took away from the precious moments I could have been eating the roast beef. My kid didn't like the crust on his bread, but that's ok. I used his crust to scoop up the rest of the potato salad. Did I mentioned that the potato salad is amazing? 

We are already planning our next trip there and the other sandwiches we are going to try. At about $10 per person for sandwich and drink, I guess that's not too bad. But for a family on a budget like us, it will have to be around once a month. The place has a very yuppy, whole foods kind of vibe. I thought it was cool that they use these cute colored cards that say Community, or Delicious, etc instead of numbers like at Paradise Bakery or Carl's Jr. It kind of classed up the joint a bit. And their nutrition information is readily available online, which makes a calorie counter like me, extremely happy. 

I got back in line to get a piece of cake (dont judge me!) and there were 2 cashiers helping customers. I was up next when all of a sudden some stupid lady gets behind one of the customers and formed her own line. Seriously lady? If you see a line of 3 or more people and yet there are not 2 lines, wouldn't you think that its single file? The lady behind me was like \"what just happened?\" and I was like \"don't worry, I got this.\" So when the cashier was available, I blatantly walked right in front of her to which she exclaimed \"oh, there's not two lines?\" and me and lady behind me both loudly exclaimed \"No (bi*ch)!\" Ok, I left out the name calling but definitely used it to describe the situation to the hubby as we walked outside.

So for anyone planning to go there, make sure you try the potato salad and remember there is only one single file line."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch before heading out for the weekend this past Friday.  The staff was so warm and welcoming, the service was fast and the food was quite tasty.  I enjoyed a cup of the mulligatawny with a half sandwich of ham & swiss with spicy honey mustard.  It was just what I was looking for at lunch...super impressed!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of panera bread back at home. I got the almond tuna sandwich along with the wildflower salad but with Caesar dressing since I wasn't too fond of the lemon vinegarette. The salad was amazing but the sandwich was only OK. Did not like the sprouts on the sandwich. My boyfriend got the turkey pastrami and omg, that was delicious! If I could, I would definitely come back for it."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Wonderful food!  Service is quick and efficient.  Always busy!"}
{"text":"I usually like Wildflower, but last night, we walked in without realizing it was 2, yes TWO minutes after 9... (I could have sworn they stayed open until 9:30pm), Instead of the staff saying anything they just gave us dirty looks and the energy was very negative. I had to ask if we did something wrong and in that question I had to ask \"oh, are you closed\" and still had a passive answer. We ended up walking out. Sorry for being 2 minutes late! Maybe you should lock your doors or speak up next time.
UPDATE: 
The management contacted me immediately after and apologized and was very responsive to our problem. Great communication and sincerity! :)"}
{"text":"Nope. Nope. Nope. Where do I start?
The food tasted AWFUL...I got the chicken parmesan...I don't know whats up with this place and lettuce...but apparently I can't order a simple chicken Parmesan without leaves; gross leaves at that; in every bite!
The place was really crowded and the lady at the register wasn't very friendly.
There was an employee who delivered our meal to us who was really friendly, which stood out to me!
Sorry Wildflower, I won't be repeating this visit. I would not recommend to a friend. :("}
{"text":"Love it here.  Always order the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Fantastic.  5* might be generous for a breakfast place but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Our gate was boarding and I needed someplace quick to grab some food. Short line and friendly service. My sister chose the ham and Swiss sandwich to share and seriously - BEST SANDWICH OF OUR LIVES. No joke. I have come to hate sandwiches over the last few years due to so much traveling + it being one of the most sensible quick and filling options. The flavor was simply divine. The bread was so fresh. 

I'm sad to see they only have locations in Arizona but will definitely come here if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again!"}
{"text":"I love Wildflower and frequently visit. My favorite thing on the menu is the seasonal Tuscan Kale salad! 

This location gets very busy for lunch so I call ahead and my food is always ready for me when I arrive."}
{"text":"I used to work at a bakery, so I have a soft spot for bread companies/places. Some things are better than others. The veggie sandwich is very tasty, but falls apart really easily. I tried the butternut squash pasta, and it was too sweet... it was almost desert-like while trying to be savory. Anyways, it didn't work for me, but the other day I got linguine with clams and that TOTALLY hit the spot with the yummy garlic bread. Pastas are available after 3pm, are at a good price point, with a good portion size. It's not like I'm going to feed you for three meals, but its filling if you have the bread with the meal. They also have some pastries that I haven't tried, but look very appealing. 

Oh, also free wifi, but please don't be talking on your bluetooth while online shopping the whole time. That bugs."}
{"text":"We love everything about Wildflower, from the wonderful bread, soups and salads to the terrific baked goods. We are a family with varied tastes and dietary preferences, and this is definitely one of our favorite casual go-to places. Great service by nice, efficient staff at all locations."}
{"text":"You get what you paid for, very nice quality. The ambiance of the store is great as well. Perfect for professional meetings, dates, or bringing your parents to."}
{"text":"Wildflower is OK for their food.  Nothing special about it, but it isn't bad either.  There are two main problems with the restaurant.  First the place is always crowded.  I'm not sure if this is because of its location next to Changing Hands or not, but usually weekends are impossible to get a clean table (if one at all).  This Wildflower seems smaller than most I've seen so it could be a local thing with this store.  Second, the crowd that eats there would seem more at home in North Scottsdale than South Tempe.  Personally I would have liked to see something more eclectic next to Changing Hands, but Wildflower is good enough for weekend brunch with your Grandma."}
{"text":"Consistently Inconsistent. 

Some days I come here for lunch and think \"WOW, why don't I come here more often\" and other times, I ponder the greatest question of all, \"Why did I come back?\" 

I love the Forest Mushroom Soup, I think it's fan-freaking-tastic. 
I do not love the bread it comes with, it's often rock hard as if it's been sitting out for days. 

I love the fruit salad. 
I do not love that unless you read the whole menu you will never know it comes with yogurt. So if you can't have dairy or you just think it's gross to have yogurt all over your grapes, you won't be pleased. 

I love the sweet potato sandwich. 
I hate that it's never the same. Sometimes it's dry, other times there's no fennel. UGH


The folks at the registers are rarely friendly but the folks who package up my lunch incorrectly are usually super nice. It's the little things, like when the cashier asks if I want utensils to go and there aren't any. Or they don't include the banana bread with the fruit salad, sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't."}
{"text":"So so gooood!  I came over here while waiting for an oil change.  The potatoes are absolutely fantastic and they make one of the best hot chocolates I've ever had :).  Food comes out quickly and is prepared well, the seating area is beautiful and comfy, and the service is friendly.  I plan on visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop by as they had a variety of baked goods to choose from and I enjoyed my chocolate croissant and hope to stop by and try more later!"}
{"text":"Had the Salmon Ceasar here and it was excellent, the fillet was moist and tasty.  The directions here is wrong though, its N of 10, not S."}
{"text":"quick dinner here for two of us was ok. salmon pasta dish was delivered instead of salmon Caesar but that was quickly corrected.  mushroom soup was tasty but not hot, barely warm when delivered.  great that they are next door to changing hands bookstore."}
{"text":"I've only ever had fond memories of Wildflower Bakery, so when I ate lunch there the other day with my boyfriend, I'm sad to say it's not the Wildflower I remember. Its been years since I've visited, but my recent experience was less than stellar. 

As we looked over the overhead menu, the cashier waited impatiently, looking around as if she had better things to do. Like lady, I just got here and you have a HUGE menu. You can do whatever you're doing and I'll call you or another employee if I'm ready. Anyway, I rushed my order and didn't request for there to be no arugula, my worst enemy. I then took a seat at one of the few clean booths. We arrived around 1 so lunch rush probably just finished and they had only begun to clean up so it was understandable. The area around the table we chose smelled quite reminiscent of a rest stop bathroom. Other patrons seemed fine but it was definitely noticeable. 

Our food arrived only about 10 minutes later. I'm not a vegetarian but any means, but I do have an unhealthy love for anything with mushrooms so I ordered the Portabello Picnic Sandwhich. I knew there were other vegetables in the sandwich but it was overwhelmingly stuffed with arugula and eggplant. The sand which was still good and edible after I hand picked all the arugula off,  I just wish there was more mushrooms in a sandwhich that advertises mushroom as its star ingredient. My boyfriend got the Reuben which was tasty, but not worth the price tag. I understand there is nothing employees can do about it so there no point throwing a fit. We left full, but not completely satisfied. I wouldn't be opposed to going to this location again, it just wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Wildflower breakfasts. There; I said it. Admitting it is the first step, right? I don't know if it's a secret ingredient in the bread or what, but I cannot get enough. Here's why...

They've got a million types of toast to choose from, and they'll toast it however dark you want. The breakfast potatoes are delicious and go perfect with their egg breakfasts. The breakfast sausage is outstanding--highly recommended. I ask for it cooked well-done, and they butterfly it and grill both sides. Mmm.

There are a few weak points. The bacon is so-so. The ham is really skimpy. And the spiced french toast was really a letdown--just not a good flavor.

Overall though, I love Wildflower. It's always clean. The staff is helpful and friendly. And their breakfasts...they're SO good. I may have to go again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. Borderline terrible. Bread rolls are hard as rocks and they hardly ever bread bowls. The soup is mediocre. I'd rather have Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"We meet here every Saturday for lunch and take up lots of space and some of us demand a lot . I would like to thank Amy Delosa manager for the excellent service and all she does to show us we are welcomed. I admire her working skills and want to thank her and all the employees that make it consistently great week after week."}
{"text":"Truly enjoy Wildflower. The food has always been well prepared and seasonal items are always exciting to try. The staff really makes Wildflower a special eatery. A few days back we met Christian, a server. This young man personifies excellent customer service. We are happy to see that great customer service is not a lost art. Though quite young, Christian is mature beyond his years and really provided us with a unique experience making sure we felt individually catered to. Great job young man! The staff in general has always been very helpful and kind. Wildflower is doing something right! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"What happened to this location?

I've been coming here for years. I get to-go food after work at least once a week and dine-in occasionally for breakfast. I liked getting to-go food here because the food is good for the price and because the place operated like clockwork. No matter what it was 10-15 minutes for my order, the food was solid, and the staff was always on top of things.

This location has done a 180. Orders consistently take 20-30+ minutes, to-go orders aren't always correct and the staff is just wandering aimlessly; both managers and hourly staff. This place could best be described as a ship without a captain. There's not enough people taking orders, food sits in the window with no one taking it out, to-go orders get ignored in the window; it's always a mess and no one seems to care and/or know what to do.

Since I come here on a regular basis I'd like to see things improve and I went so far as to email the company--something I never do-- and the CEO himself replied and acknowledged that they were aware of issues at the Arcadia location and were working on it. That was 3-4 months ago and things are just as bad.

I'm moving out of the neighborhood so it doesn't really matter to me anymore what happens here, but hopefully they turn it around for their sake."}
{"text":"I wanted cheap and easy, and this place reminds me of Le Pain Quotidien in how it offers great food for reasonable prices and other market-style goodies as well. I was traveling for business and was relieved to find a Panera-esque restaurant on Yelp.

I ordered the Salmon/Mango salad, as well as a mango sandwich. Both were delicious, and the same price as if I'd gotten similar fare at Panera. I'm sad that we don't have these in Philly, but I'll definitely be back if I'm ever traveling in the area and need a quick meal."}
{"text":"Had never been to a Wildflower. Awesome service, they went out of there way to accommodate our picky eater"}
{"text":"Good food along with the prices. Waiting for your food is a decent wait time. Try the chicken pesto pasta. It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent potato cream cheese soup. Very rich and hearty. Great for a sore throat. Paired with half sandwich of turkey, tomato and Brie. Nice combo. 
Finished off lunch with a huge delicious chocolate hazelnut sea salt cookie. 
Nice break between flights."}
{"text":"This place reminds of me Panera Bread.   The Caesar salad with chicken was delish and filling and the Blackberry Orange Lemonade tasted like summer.   A perfect place for a quick and easy bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great prices, Healthy eating, fun hangout"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned...  The food is quite good, but the service/operations are inconsistent and weak.

On our most recent visit, we showed up around lunch time, and it was a zoo.  Unlike say Paradise Bakery / Au Bon Pain or other similar models, there are no clearly demarcated lines, and in this location the order counter is located quite close to the pass, so it's quite hectic when busy.  The line wasn't too deep (maybe 8-10 people with 2 registers working), but it did take a short bit to place our order.

The service today was a reminder of why I find myself split between lining up in support of the $15/hr movement and the opposite.   The young guy taking our order was everything you'd like in a customer-facing food service role.  Friendly.  Efficient.  I'd pay that 15/hr and have no problem with paying a bit more for my food to have places staffed by people like that (even if the work, per se, doesn't necessarily justify such a wage... he's a hardworking kid on his way to contributing to society - great).  

Then, after waiting 15 minutes for them to call our name (which never happened - though it was obviously on the receipt and in the order plan), we went to the counter and inquired about our order with young, redheaded gal (as we noticed a bag sitting on the counter that appeared to match our order).  I asked if they called my name (as it was quite loud before - but at this point, the rush had passed and the bag had been sitting there for at least 5 minutes (since we noticed)).  She just asked what my name was, walked over, grabbed the bag and handed to us.  Then, just as take it and start to look inside, she says \"have a nice day\" in a robotic tone and is gone.  Nice.  Not that she owed us anything, but the failure to even grasp/acknowledge that someone's meal had been sitting there getting cold and lost amongst the shuffle says a) failure by her management, and b) lack of initiative/desire to excel.   The latter is fine (especially for a kid working in food service), but there's no way in hell I'd fork over a penny more to support any kind of wage increase for that kind of service. 

So yeah... confusing - but anyway, that's neither here nor there.

Overall, the food was fine (if cold from being left on the counter), but at the given price point (~$25 for 2 people), seems like they'd be slightly better than MacDonald's at the little things... like getting orders into customers hands when completed.  Clearly, the rush played a role, but I have to assume this isn't the first time they've had a rush, and we didn't notice the bag sitting there until after the rush had cleared out and we could see - and the manager (who was running the pass) was standing there talking to another manager.

Is it big deal?  No.  Just a mild annoyance - but it is symptomatic of a weak operations management and definitely enough for me to choose Potbelly next door for sandwich and Paradise Bakery when I want comparable food next time."}
{"text":"One of the best go-to spots to eat in or take out for lunch or dinner. Great service and great food. Not too expensive. The chopped salad with chicken is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love wildflower and I go here quite often, my family often orders for pick up. And they have only messed up a few times but they're super nice and try their best to correct it. They're always busy but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Got the penne with pesto.  Penne was so overcooked it often split just lifting it with the fork.  The pesto was ok except it was sort of slimy.  Buitoni Basil pesto from the grocery store is better.  The bread was good.  For the price it's not worth it.  I didn't even eat it all due to the sliminess of the pesto.  The noise level is very high too."}
{"text":"I tried to order a cup of soup and half a sandwich, but the cashier said no cause they don't do that for hot sandwiches.  I asked why , she said they just don't.  I said I was happy to pay extra if necessary and the cashier just said \"No\".  So...I'm voting with my dollars.  I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Called ahead to see if they have a specific type of bread. They said that they did and quoted me a price on the phone. When I arrived to pick it up, they wouldn't sell it to me claiming that they might need it for breakfast foods (it was after noon when I arrived)."}
{"text":"After trying their samples for years at many Yelp event's I finally had a chance to eat here.

Start with a free bred and butter sample, makes sense as this is a bread company.

I had the butternut squash ravioli, I really liked this dish however the filling does cross the line from savory to sweet.

My wife's salad was great too I now have a place where I can eat and she can have a hearty salad at good prices."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Wildflower location open up by my work. It's a good alternative to Paradise Bakery. The two have pretty similar concept. They just opened up here about a month ago and I have probably grabbed lunch here 8-9 times already. My favorites are the cream cheese potato soup and the wildflower salad. I usually get the wildflower two (choose two from any: soup, salad, or half sandwich) Also the blackberry/orange lemonade is really good. I've tried two different sandwiches and thought they were okay. What brings me back each time is that potato soup! The sourdough bread that comes with it is good as well."}
{"text":"I love this place their salads are amazing and I have had the best customer service. Every time I go in there which is usually twice a week they remember my order and are always friendly. I customize my salad to just the way I like it and it is the same every time. Nothing better than consistency when dealing with food. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a healthy alternative to fast food. Oh and their green tea is very good as well. 

Can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"All the workers, with the exception of the person bagging the order, were very nice and attentive. Food was great - pick up order for 14, office lunch. Everyone enjoyed - like the variety of items and the bakery items! Had to grab one while to enjoy while I waited for the order."}
{"text":"Though not my top choice, my family and friends love this place mostly for it's healthy food image.  I do find myself here at least once a week and I recommend the chopped salad.  Others have recommended the haddock sandwich and butternut squash ravioli.  It is also kid friendly and have great selections for kids such as pasta and fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Always good. I am glad they got rid of the bread salad. Great for breakfast lunch or din. Everything is good here, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"My go to place for great food that I would prepare for myself. Always fresh ingredients put together with care and served with efficiency.
Love the outdoor patio seating and the great location. Thank you for being reliably great."}
{"text":"Banana walnut pancakes are my go to for a quick breakfast. I wish their bacon was thick cut."}
{"text":"So many tempting places to choose from...  we chose Wildflower Bread Company.  My autumn pumpkin soup was really good :-) with the chicken salad sandwich and its fresh ingredients...  the little birds outside were waiting for my crumbs :-)"}
{"text":"I need help!  Serious help!!  I've been in town for the week on business and after trying Wildflower Bread Company I have been back every day!  Where do I start?!!  I love the salads.  I tried the quinoa salad and the chicken and heirloom/feta salad.  Just ridiculously yummy and healthy.   I also tried breakfast....oatmeal and LOVED it!!  I just found out they have two at the airport and thus will have one more Wildflower Bread Company meal before heading back to LA!  

I will miss you WFB Co!!!!!!  xoxo"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  They have a lot of great options from \"normal\" to unique vegetarian meals.  The portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"Needed soup tonight, and had to come here!! Love the potato soup, and the staff was awesome tonight!!"}
{"text":"Always get the stuffed french toast. Menu description: Sourdough french toast stuffed with whipped cream cheese served with blueberry compote and hot maple syrup. Their maple syrup is terrific. Like their bacon, too.  Usually get meals to go though on occasion have dined in at both the Tempe and Gilbert locations, and then enjoy their coffee. Nice to go early Sat/Sun before the crowd arrives; breakfast served till 2pm on weekends.  Later that morning: Just got home from WBC in Gilbert. My own review made me hungry. Now enjoying the stuffed french toast as I write this...Yum."}
{"text":"I had the wildflower chopped salad and it was fantastic! Fresh, tasty, and healthy. I highly recommend this place for lunch when you are at SkyHarbor airport."}
{"text":"I purchased a Asian salad along with loaf of bread the cashier was great.  My order was togo once I got home to eat the salad turns out that salad doesn't have any chicken.  Not a happy camper called and now my name is in guest book. I'm not sure I want to go back."}
{"text":"I want to thank Destiny for making sure my togo order was complete even with chicken on the Asian Salad. The salad and cheesecake was very delicious.  Thanks Arrowhead location for a job well done and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"My salad, MY SAAAAAAAA-LAD!!!

Ok we've never been here before, but this place is Panera Bread-esque. You go to the counter and place an order from a giant near to the ceiling menu. Breakfast, sandwiches and soups, OH MY! And of course there is large display of pastries and bread to salivate over. 

I mentioned to the lady at the counter that today was Erik's birthday and for our reason out and before I could finish she asked Erik to choose a pastry for his birthday.....yay!!!

Erik grabbed a cheese danish with his cheesecake birds pastry. I ordered the Thai chicken salad. 

Oooooohmygawd. I have to confess it was one of the best salads I've eaten. The dressing wasn't too strong, just subtle and blended perfectly. And large. I know it's not pretty to be a dainty girl sitting in front of a family sized plate but when it's a salad I think GO BIG. The place was packed, loud and hustling. Everyone's plate was full and everything looked so freah. 

I wish this quality of a salad existed where I live but it's not and I'm already getting sad, so I need to end this write up."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and choose it because of all the great reviews. I had never heard of it and was slightly disappointed when I walked in and saw that it looked a lot like Panera.  Well it is like Panera, but only GOOD!  

You order at the front - and choose from salads, sandwiches, and soups. A lot of different baked goods.  They give you a number and then bring the food to your table.  

I had the wildflower salad with cilantro and lavender dressing. So good with chopped veggies and mixed greens.  I also ordered the lentil soup which was served too hot and it took too long to cool down so I didn't get to eat but a bite or two (I was in a hurry).  

Warning: I went mid-week at lunch time and the place was packed.  There was no place to sit so I had to ask to share a table with another person."}
{"text":"This place was packed and I was completely unimpressed. You stand in line for you meal, order, take your marker to the table and you're served. 

Not so bad, as I was looking for a light salad-type lunch. I ordered the chop-chop salad which was ok. The salad has wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette. 

We also had the Emerald Spinach salad with chicken which was better. This salad has spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette. 

Ambiance note: There's a Yelp and Facebook ad on every table. Seriously, the ambiance was institutional and very chain-like. It's a baby magnet and the acoustics are horrible as the metal ceiling caused the noise to bounce all over making for a really loud place to eat. 

Last, there's a bakery, but I honestly thought the bread was boring, bland and too tough of a crust.

This place may get a second chance, but only for take-out and no more Chop Chop salad. Portions are reasonable, but a far better salad is served at Paradise Deli with a lot more substance."}
{"text":"This was a diversion from eating a salad at Paradise Bakery every day. I realized after walking in, that I'd eaten in the Scottsdale location for breakfast once. 

We ordered salads and they were really good, but too much dressing. (We should have ordered dressing on the side).

Good food, good service and get in here early else the line gets really gnarly."}
{"text":"Great spot for solo lunch or to meet friends! The Waldorf Salad is perfection with crispy apples, sliced turkey and lots of other fun stuff atop mixed greens with a balsamic glaze! Super generous portions too! We meet here on most Sundays for post workout breakfasts and the service is fast, they are also super with special requests! There is a coffee bar too so no waiting to get that refill!"}
{"text":"Reliably great food and service. Always kept nice and clean. Good place to bring your laptop and do some work while enjoying a bite to eat. Tasty sandwiches and pasta dishes as well as a wide variety of sweet treats. Usually never crowded or loud. Convenient location in PV/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed. I came here to pick up my lunch. I saw them set it in the window at the pass bar and it was there for about 20 minutes. I was sitting right behind the girl. She never called my name. So my food just sat there getting cold for 20 minutes.. while I waited for no reason. This normally wouldn't bother me but I am six months pregnant and can't eat cold meat. 

I just paid $10 for food that I can't eat, awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of our family favorites in Scottsdale.  The food is consistently great and always high quality.  I love the egg sandwiches or oatmeal for breakfast and my kids love the pancakes.  For lunch, the potato soup, BLT and wildflower salad are all fantastic.  My husband also recommends the roast beef sandwich.  The pricing is also good and keeps us coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"After leaving a review voicing my concerns, I was quickly contacted by the CEO of wildflower bread Company,  he was very concerned about my experience and wanted further details to ensure the problem was taken care of.  This is the type of company and company philosophy that garners my support."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious, and that includes the food I've taken off other people's plates!

I have come here with my large (10+ people) family several times for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Our order is always taken so promptly and the staff is so nice with the kids. We can always find a big clean table, very comfortable atmosphere.

The tuna, the roast beef, the hummus, the bites of Mediterranean salad I took from my mom ... I can't even choose a favorite menu item. Oh, and the bakery... The piece of chocolate chip scone I swiped off my husband's plate last time was heavenly. There is such a great selection for breakfast too. The frittatas are light and healthy, and the stuffed French toast is a real treat - My little sister didn't even notice when I took a bite!

This is the perfect place for breakfast and lunch. I will keep coming back any time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I come here specifically for the mushroom soup, it's amazing. Although anything here is pretty good, so you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. It's also always clean!

The only reason it lost a star is because the cashier staff are always a little confused...multiple times they rang me wrong, or didn't know what came with the food (bread or no bread?)....after some proper training I would give this place 5 stars, but that needs to be improved. I shouldn't be telling them what comes with my meal and what doesn't....

The manager is awesome, but is also the hardest worker here by observation!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites in the area,  but tonight it was off the charts. We tried the new Lemon Penne Chicken Pasta with feta cheese and walnuts. It was so refreshing with a bit of a spicy kick! We paired it with a chopped salad that they split for us and even took the red peppers off my hubby' s plate...great service!"}
{"text":"The chopped salad with salmon and the potato cream cheese soup is one of my favorite meals. Chopped salad consists of wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette.  It is my favorite salad... And with every order you get a  couple pieces of the famous WF bread - dip it in the soup...  excellent!  They are always quick to put together a take out order. Delicious food. Oh, and great carrot cake also... Always consistent quality."}
{"text":"Visiting family pre-holidays, I wish we had this much jazzed up version of the soup, salad, sandwich (and breakfast, bread, and dessert restaurant in my city.) Offering super gourmet bread choices, Levain, challah, caraway, and tons of others, plus a slew of soup choices every single day, the offerings alone make a trip here worth it.

I got what must be a seasonal sandwich choice, a kind of Thanksgiving in total in a sandwich, with a side of white and sweet potato chips. The sandwich was turkey on stuffing bread, with cranberry sauce, bacon, bacon herb mayo, and tons of cranberry stuffing. It was huge, hearty and delicious and could sub for Thanksgiving dinner itself. I also got a piece of dark chocolate cake for later that was smooth, silky and delicious. I would love to try lots of the sandwiches and soups Wildflower offers."}
{"text":"We walked from the popular book store, Changing Hands, into a very busy Willdflower Bread Co. after placing our order we got the only remaining empty table. My chicken Parmesan open face sandwich was excellent except the bread compressed very thin."}
{"text":"I got their ultimate bacon and egg sandwich and it was just so greasy. It was a bit difficult to eat. The sandwich was ridiculously oversized and oily and everything I touched was just dirty afterwards. I thought if you halved the sandwich it would have been a lot more manageable to eat.

The cafe is really cute though. It's definitely one of the better airport dining options, all things considered."}
{"text":"The bread made the sandwich! Great for breakfast. The lady at the register was also very pleasant"}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a quick lunch. Lots of options for both cold and hot sandwiches. I was there for a meeting and it was quiet enough to have a conversation but still very busy and lively. I enjoyed the turkey and brie sandwich.  

They have wi-fi too which is nice. 

Careful, parking can be tight."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3 1/2  stars  , because I am half a fan.  Wildflower is still a solid choice for  breakfast / lunchtime . My parents love the  soups and sandwiches, so it's a great place for lunch after church. My roast beef sandwich  tasted fine, but unmemorable.  My daughter adored her Morning Glory muffin which she has everytime she is there because there really isn't anything wlse tht interests her. I wish that the flavors would have more consistent pizazz.  It's solid but no earth shaking."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never tried this place before. I guess the name threw me off. Sounds like a Bakery, right? Well I was going to try this other restaurant and stumbled upon this place.

I was pleasantly surprised because it looked like a Panera Bread and has an awesome offering of soups, multiple sandwich combinations, pastries, and breakfast.

I had the braised beef which had rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes on a grilled Ciabatta roll, served with au jus, horseradish sauce, original and sweet potato chips for $7.99. It was delicious and just the right serving size. My wife had the half Wildflower Chicken Salad chicken breast, red and green peppers, jicama, celery, green onion, lemon, garlic and mayo with tomato, cucumber, romaine and clover sprouts on Nine Grain for $7.19 plus the French Onion Soup. She loved every bite and slurp.

 I just wish the tables weren't so close together. It would be ok to walk between tables if you were a 90 pound gymnast. But, sadly, most of us aren't built that way.

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"As I sit here stuffed from my butternut squash ravioli sipping my blackberry orange lemonade  I am wondering what other delishness can they cook up?

Casual place with some basic and some finer options for lunch or dinner though both times I have frequented for late lunch.   I would like a little better assortment of fresh pastries and desserts but I can always stop by Paradise or sprinkles on my way home!

If your in the area...try  one of these places."}
{"text":"We love going to this place with our family! We have two kids and they're always very accommodating they help with high chairs and finding a place for us to sit.  We love their desserts and their potato bacon soup and BLTs are the best.  We always have to get fresh brewed iced teas too.  On the weekends we usually get breakfast here- husband likes the Taylor ham sandwich, great place for families.  I have no idea why anyone would give this place a bad review."}
{"text":"Wildflower bread Company was phenomenal the service was great our food tasted amazing and I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go for a quick bite when you want a tasty breakfast but don't want to cook. You order at the counter, you hope to find a table, you wait for your food. Service is friendly but they're really busy and getting anything fixed or anything additional will probably take a trip to the counter.  

The bread is, of course, delicious and they had free samples available when I went on a Saturday around 10:30 am.

I had some whole grain toast with my eggs over easy and home fries and the toast was damn near the best part of the meal.  The eggs were fine and I really liked the home fries with a smattering of...rosemary.  I'd say there might be some quality issues with the home fries though because my serving of home fries was great.  Nicely-sized chunks of potato, hot, tasty.  My stepdad's side order looked like they'd scraped the bottom of the pan for his.  He had a small pile of withered slivers of potato.  So if home fries matter to you, just beware.  

I went there on a quest for delicious lemon pancakes and ordered the short stack.  They were quite good but the lemon flavor is subtle so if you're looking for some punch in your lemon pancakes you won't find it here.  I wasn't loving the blueberry compote though I usually love fruit and fruit compotes on my pancakes.  Perhaps it drowned out the subtle lemon taste too much.  The hot syrup was just right for topping the pancakes.  My stepdad complained the pancakes weren't moist enough but my mom and I disagreed.  You'd think he'd be bitter after his minuscule home fry experience but he said his ham frittata was tasty and he went back for seconds on the coffee. I had a mocha with whip cream which was good though not as good as you'd get at Starbucks. 

All in all a great experience if you know what you're getting into."}
{"text":"I went to Wildflower for the first time today for lunch. A friend suggested it so I decided to give it a try. It reminded me of a Panera Bread type place as soon as I walked in. I heard they had great salads, so I chose the chopped salad (but substituted the salmon for chicken). It was AWESOME!! I never thought I would use the word \"awesome\" to describe a salad, but it definitely was wonderful. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. The staff was friendly and welcoming as well. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Food here is very good, but the people who work here are dumb as rocks, really its sad.  But quality is good and so are the free samples of bread which I can butter up and get crazy with in a scrumptious way.  Also they have a full coffee bar so you can get your espresso on and get back to work running on all cylinders!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch  on a cool cloudy day and WBC had just the item...Chicken Parmigiana.  Moist chicken, flavorful marinara and plenty of melted cheese on their perfectly toasted french bread.  YUM!
My new favorite place for this dish."}
{"text":"Good when your with a group of friends or dining alone. The food is always delicious and the menu gives you amazing options from hot sandwiches to gourmet salads. And if your feeling naughty try one of the huge baked goods...you won't be disappointed! 

This location serves the locals as well as the business community and they do a great job with a very busy staff."}
{"text":"I tried their new V12 salad with chicken and found it more like a meal than a salad. It was delicious and all 12 of the roasted vegetables were perfectly prepared. The chicken is always moist and flavorful. 

I joined others and they were all jealous of my selection!  I'm not sure what the dressing was but its probably not my favorite, fortunately this salad doesn't require any dressing because the veggies were well seasoned. 

Keep the new fresh ideas coming WFBC,
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Come Saturday night for dinner. It's wide open!
Soups on and sandwiches are plentiful!

There wasn't a big crowd because most consider this a lunch spot but whether your into eating light or heavy they have something on the menu for you.  Have you tired the open face chicken parmesan?  Definitely a Hungry Man entree!"}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese in the world. The bread is always perfect, staff always friendly and a really nice environment"}
{"text":"Serviceable soup and sandwich joint but I would have rather eaten at Paradise Bakery (they have cookies for instance)."}
{"text":"This new location is super clean and way more modern than the one on Val Vista. We loved that the lemonade was by the soda machines and not behind the counter. Food and service were fantastic!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I was working for a company nearby and would frequent this establishment often because it reminded me of Northern CA. It had good bread, interesting combinations and at the time, a non-chain quality ingredient type restaurant. I introduced many to this place including my Mother and co-workers galore. 

When I was in AZ in January, I had a breakfast date planned with a girlfriend from high school. It is amazing at what connections Facebook has brought back into my life and this is one of the great ones. I suggested to meet here because it was easy enough to hop on the 101 from Sun City and easy enough for her to hop on I-17 from where she lives. 

I arrived a little early and waited in the car right in front of the restaurant. I  was thrilled to see how busy it was and all the people drinking coffee and eating outside with their dogs. As I was getting out of the car, I noticed a particular stunning dog and talked to him first then looked at the owner of the pooch. Wouldn't you know it, but it was on of my old bosses (a big boss at that) whom I hadn't seen in maybe 12 years. Small world indeed!

Lara walked up and we went inside. I had to keep myself from drooling at all of the baked offerings and almost ordered my old favorite lunch instead of breakfast. After going back and forth a little (this is an order at the counter type of place) I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes and a couple of over easy eggs on the side. Lara ordered the banana nut pancakes with scrambled eggs and we both had iced tea. The bill was something less than $20 and we easily found a booth, hankered down and sipped on delicious tea while we waited for our food.

The food was great-eggs perfectly done, pancakes delicious albeit a little more dense than I am used to with ricotta cakes, but really good. We took up the booth for what seemed like hours (it was really only about 1 1/2) and chatted away. Was the breakfast 5 stars, no, probably more like a solid 3.75 but for all they offer, for the memories, the company and the iced tea alone, it is a 5 all the way."}
{"text":"All hail to another Wildflower location closer to my Mom and Grandma's house! 

I have long been a fan of the WBC-and though they took away the bread salad they used to have, this is still one fantastic place. The menu seems more complex than I remembered, but lucky for me, they still have my favorite sandwich on the menu. Service was friendly and efficient. This location is still new, so I suspect they will get the flow of service and food execution down pat. 

Lots more outdoor seating here then the Deer Valley location and I look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"The Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich is the most fantastic concoction ever created.  It is like Wildflower tapped into my brain a stole all of my favorite things and placed it between two gorgeous pieces of bread. Marinated fennel, fig confit, roasted sweet potato, arugula, buffalo mozzerla on focaccia bread. I warn you. It is massivee and I could barely eat 1/4th of it. But oh is it worth it. Dont think, just do it."}
{"text":"I visited the new Wildflower in Gilbert with my family and I have to tell you this restaurant is just fantastic. The staff is very friendly. Jerry took our order, she was very friendly and offered great suggestions. I had the chorizo frittata and it was the BEST. One of the managers stopped by and talked with us, his name was either Brandon or Brian and he was very nice as well and made us feel at home. We will definitely be back because of people like Jerry and Brandon/Brian...keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"It was my second time here and I love this place came in for lunch extremely busy the manager with red hair had time to help us with our selection and was great!! She was all over the place helping everybody with a smile thanks for the experience
Tanya"}
{"text":"This is not a very good Wildflower anymore. I used to be a frequent visitor and enjoyed the food. Over time I started noticing a decline in quality. I noticed especially that the dishes here were not as tasty and well-composed as the ones at the Chandler Mall location. The ingredients are the same, but the preparation of the vegetables and proteins is not very carefully done. Still, it wasn't that bad so I have continued to visit. Tonight I realize they have really gone downhill with their quality control. They served me a salad that was not washed and had sand in it. It was their signature \"wildflower\" salad. It was very disappointing and they did not reimburse the meal, which I returned. I'm sad to see what used to be a great restaurant give up on standards of excellence."}
{"text":"The food was amazing...especially the potato cream cheese soup. Christmas music playing overhead made for a nice evening with my 11 yr old son. Gavin Logan, our server made the night so much fun! He quizzed my son and awarded him a cookie. Very generous and brought a big smile to a sweet boy.  Thank you Gavin Logan!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice BLTs and Caesar salads...their secret ingredient in the salad is marinated mushrooms!"}
{"text":"This location is great, I really love how it's connected to the bookstore; albeit that being said, the employees are happy to help and are very friendly, I worked at a diner for a while and when we were busy, I mean BUSY, missing orders, falling behind, messing up orders, long lines, etc. if you enter this location during the breakfast, lunch or dinner rush, they are PACKED, by some amazing means, they manage to keep the lines moving quick, your waiting ten minutes MAXIMUM, and they still manage to bring exactly your order to your table in a reasonable amount of time, in a crowded restaurant. I frequent this location and I refuse to go anywhere"}
{"text":"This place is fresh and sooooo good. but the prices are kinda high. If your looking for a great chopped salad this is the place"}
{"text":"LOCATION- on point
CUSTOMER SERVICE- superior
FOOD- anticipated Panera, was surprised to find its WAAAAAAAAY better quality and taste. 

We had to taste everything so we had them toast half a bagel, with the remaining half to-go. I let the hubby pick and he had never experienced the joys of a chocolate chip bagel so that was the unlucky soldier. When we ordered the bagel, Kathleen suggested it toasted with Peanut Butter. I about keeled over. Who are you Kathleen and where have you been all my life?! We are officially new best friends. I have never even heard of such a thing or would have ever considered putting peanut butter on a bagel of any sort so she won my heart. Then I spotted the cinnamon raisin bagels and requested we do the same with this but with butter. This was we both get a quarter, just enough to taste but not too much too waste. Great decision here!! 

Little did we know, Breakfast menu ended a little bit before we arrived so we immediately had to change the plans to lunch. I asked about soups. Kathleen brought us each a sample of the soup we requested. Wowzer!!!!! Yeah, I had to have the lemon chicken with rice and a half chicken salad sandwich topped with lettuce, fresh tomatoes and sprouts. It was outstanding. The soup was still my favorite but I could definitely go for that sandwich again. 

TheY we're out of cinnamon rolls but I called early and I will be going to another location this morning to pick them up because they are out at this one today. CANT WAIT!!!

AMBIANCE- fast casual and perfectly done
CLEANLINESS- very good. Witnessed constant cleaning of tables and picking up of all areas. 
MANAGEMENT- came through and personally touched our table and many others to make sure everyone was pleased and ask if you needed anything. 
OVERALL EXPERIENCE- I would give 6 stars to Wildflower based on what I had walked in to the establishment expecting and what I walked out feeling. 

Definitely returning. Definitely!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good! the staff goes out of there way to make it special! As we were sitting for our plane there was a baby that was having a meltdown and one of the staff came out into the waiting area next to the restaurant and gave the scared little girl and her father a cookie to calm her down. It was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Love it.
Love it.

I'm slightly obsessed with their lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love their breakfast sausage.  I love their mocha drinks.  I love their prices.

I do not like the big lines that sometimes build up

But the food and cheap prices make up for it.

Love you Wildflower."}
{"text":"I actually liked this place, I had the spicy chipotle egg sandwich. I wasn't to excited about it. Looked healthy and all. But it was very good, I liked the spinach and the brioche roll. Food is well worth it, Especially from the airport. Prices are as expected, and they have a very large selection."}
{"text":"Gonna have to give this place a big ole' fat \"MEH.\"

My son had the \"Turbo BLT\" or whatever they called it.  The cheddar cheese overwhelmed the taste - my son had to take it off the bread.  The \"avocado\" advertised was some kind of tasteless guacamole paste.

I had the Beef & Gorgonzola sammich.  Nothing remarkable about it - it was basically flavorless.

I usually judge sammich places by asking myself, \"Can I easily make a better sammich than this myself in my own kitchen?\"

The answer today for both sammiches was a resounding \"HECK YES.\"

The coconut pie was good.  Not great, just good.

I can't see a return trip in my future.

P.S.  Overhearing a young employee telling another one \"I got my period today\" and having the other one reply \"I did too\" does not seem very professional.  I understand how perfectly natural that conversation is - but as an employee on the job, you really shouldn't have customers 
overhearing that sort of thing, should you?

UPDATE:  The founder contacted me and refunded my money.  And gave me a $20 gift card.  I'm going back to give them another shot.  Good business practice, standing behind and defending the company like that.  To be admired.  More companies should be so proactive.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Ate there with my kids 3-17-2011.  

Gonna go with 3.75 stars overall, rounded up to 4.

Service was good, prompt, polite, and efficient, and the place was clean and tidy.  4.5 stars for those items.

We had:

Side Caesar salad:  My daughter thought the dressing was a little bit, in her words, \"sour.\"  I tried it, and maybe it was a little bit on the \"tart\" side.  Veggies were fresh and crunchy though, so it was not a total loss.  3.5 stars.

Chicken Basil Chili in a sourdough Boule:   fairly tasty, IMHO.  My son thought it was a little bland, but his tastes are kinda weird.  I tried it, and I thought it was good.  The sourdough was fresh and good. 3.0 stars.

Side of meatballs with marinara sauce:  The star of the meal.  Very tasty sauce, and the meat was firm and tasted how a meatball is supposed to taste, in both texture and seasonings.  4.5 stars for this dish.

I had the \"Gorgonzola Pasilla Chile Penne - creamy alfredo, white wine, pasilla chile flakes, crushed red pepper, red peppers, gorgonzola and arugula $7.99\"   It was good.  Could have used some MEAT - maybe I could have added chicken to it, but I failed to notice it was meatless when I ordered it - MY BAD !!   I'd have it again if it had chicken in it.  It was a nicely seasoned and prepared dish.  4.0 stars.

All in all, a MUCH better trip than my first one.  I might have to give them a couple more visits to make sure.... :)"}
{"text":"Tried their new Atlantic Haddock Sandwich, and it was delicious! The fish was well cooked and flavorful, and the bread was so light and fluffy! And it came with a tasty orzo salad I wish I could have gotten more of. 

Also tried their soup (Chicken Basil Chili) and salad (Wildflower Salad) combo, and it was satisfying but not amazing. The salad has quite a bit of dressing, so I would suggest asking for the dressing on the side if possible. The bread that came with the soup and salad was yummy though! It's the bread of the month, and they also have samples in store, and it's available for purchase!"}
{"text":"Service was on point and the cashier was helpful. Had the pesto chicken linguini it was large enough for me and very filling. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the Chandler, AZ area."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Turkey pastrami was amazing.  Chocolate cake was delicious.  Carrot was just decent.  Two sandwhiches with chips and two pieces of cake was just over $24.00.  Sandwhiches had just the right amount of meat & toppings.  They respond really well to special orders.  new location opens in Scottsdale on Scottsdale & Indian Bend June 15th!"}
{"text":"I received amazing customer service at this Wildflower today. I called in an order and they were out of a few items so we had to get creative. When I got there to pick up my food they gave me a free drink and apologized for not having all of the vegetables necessary to make my salad. I am vegan and when I got back to my office and opened my salad that was suppose to be cheeseless I found cheese hiding at the bottom. I emailed Tristan the manager to let him know what had happened and pointed out that the situation could have been very dangerous for someone with an allergy. He called me back minutes later with a very sincere apology and a promise to do some retraining with the prep staff. He also reimbursed me for the meal and gave me a very generous gift card. You don't see service like this very often. I was so impressed with how Tristan handled his stores bumpy day."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Wildflower Bread Company for 20 years.  I  have visited the new Rivulon location several times, giving it a chance to work out the kinks.  I can tell you I will not be back to this location.  Today was the worst experience yet.  Order was incorrect, food was delivered cold and a mgr did try to rectify the errors with a refund, it still doesn't change the fact that it was a bad experience with food and service.  Having experienced Mother's Day in previous years at the Gilbert WF, I can tell you that this experience was awful.  I had to ask the cashier how do I get my loaf of bread for Mother's Day and he had to go to the back to get it.  Then it was just handed to me as an afterthought.  Plus drinks are more expensive here and scones are smaller."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Kevin is a great server.  Have been there twice recently and both times Kevin was there and he is so happy and upbeat.  Just a pleasant, bright light to welcome you in the morning!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the dining area was too crowded and the whole space seemed dingy and unkempt. The Chandler mall location is much better."}
{"text":"This is a great Wildflower Bread Company. It's always spotless, staff is very friendly and food is great. My kids are PICKY eaters, and both of them have enjoyed their meals at this location...breakfast, lunch and dinner! The manager (Frank) is also very helpful. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Ok so I decided to say something about this place mainly due to I got a free loaf of bread for father's day. I like their salads, sandwiches and soups. They have a great variety of breads and pastries. This particular location is my favorite (McClintock and Warner) as sometimes I bring my JRT and they are nice to give me a water dish :). Good ambiance too as they are next to a Changed Hands bookstore. Come and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Spicy cuban sandwich was TOTALLY amazing. Knocked my socks off actually. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"I am not one to do this at all but the service I received I had to write a review. I was in Phoenix Arizona on the 31st of August around 3-4 waiting on my flight back home when I got hungry and decided to give Wild Flower Bread Company a try. As soon as I got there one of the managers just had a very rude tone towards me and I felt rushed during my visit. I was looking at the menu and she had told me the line started back there but I wasn't ready she turns around and I believe I over heard her say \"people are stupid they don't understand where the line starts\" to one of the other employees. I still got something from the menu because i wanted a try and the young lady who helped me at the register had a completely different attitude. Manager should really have a better attitude. I didn't get her name but she had her ponytail braided and glasses. But overall the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Was here for a quick dinner tonight with Sharon H. as we were both looking for something in Tempe that filled the requirements of quick, healthy and cheap and this was about all the two of us could figure out. She had the Albacore tuna sandwich and I opted for the Roast beef and Gorgonzola. 

Sharon said this and I quote of hers: \"This is so good I could eat two of these\" and \"the almonds just make me want to keep eating.\" That was following an arrival where she said it was too big and she should have gotten a half.

Sadly I was not as impressed with mine. While solid it was nothing I would crave or devour. The roast beef was wonderful and not over cooked which is rare but the mayo which it touted as being herb spiced mayo seemed nothing more than plain old mayo and there was too much of it. The cheese and beef combo worked well but I like the Beef and Brie at Bison Witches pairing better. 

The bread however was awesome on both with no complaints in that department.

I will keep coming back but probably as a change of pace from dillys and bison witches as those are two of my favs when i want a soup and sammy deal"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A step up from Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery! The food is very fresh, the menu well-thought-out and the staff is extremely friendly. I wish I knew my cashier's name, it is nowhere on the receipt (they should start doing that!)... but I would give him 10 stars! Super friendly and very kind! They also manage to keep the place very clean in spite of all the families bringing their messy kids lol. There is always a busser walking around. As far as the food goes, I have been going to this place and the Chandler location for 3 years now and I am IN LOVE with the chopped salad. It is a great mix of salmon, fresh green goodness and crunchy cool flavor with a delicious pesto dressing!  drool... I could live off of that salad. I also love their soups. The staff is kind enough to give you a sample if you are unsure ;) . I also just had their cheesecake for the first time yesterday, they have plenty of great pastries to choose from and freshly baked bread every day! Love it, I only wish I lived next door"}
{"text":"I'm here in Goodyear, Arizona with my Grandson at a baseball  tournament and we were looking for a place for breakfast. I'm sure glad that we stopped in at Wildflower. Very fresh and tasty food, clean restaurant and friendly staff. Had a nice conversation with the manager Greg who told me about the concept and the company. We will certainly try to get back before we head home!"}
{"text":"Alyson Knight, 
We can't thank you enough for all of your help with our crazy orders, and taking the time to separate out all of our bills.

{"text":"Oh.... Wildflower. If I could marry you I would, but my fiance would...not...approve....

Where do I start? Everything about Wildflower is awesome. Every location I ever have been to, has been SO CONSISTENT, it is unreal. I can go to the location out in Prescott and enjoy the same friendly service and amazing food that they offer at this awesome location (I chose this one because its closer to me). I finally realize its becoming a chain, but they haven't sacrificed any quality since their expansion. 

I can't really recommend anything specifically on the menu, it is all so damn good. Really, I can't, and yes I know this is a review so I should have an opinion....Ok, honestly, I guess if you break my wrist for some more info I see their breakfast as the strongest portion of the menu, but I could be off when I make this assumption. I love the pancakes the most. 

Random, right? : Pancakes....simple, easy, I could make them at home (lies...I'd burn them). They have a banana nut pancake which is tubular (1 point for Jefe for the usage of tubular). I have had a lot on each menu, but the options for breakfast out-class most eateries in town. Even the bathrooms are clean and friendly....yes, I just jumped from pancakes to bathrooms. Deal with it.

Come here and enjoy the food, no matter what time of the day. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always clean and super friendly staff. We had a mix-up with our take out order, and when we talked to Chandler about it, he handled it in the nicest way and got us our correct food and even two chocolate chip cookies for our kids. Super great! Food is always awesome too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here Easter Sunday looking for a place to eat. We've never been in a WBC but have heard great reviews. It was open so in we went.. we ordered the wildflower Ruben sandwich & were not disappointed! I love ordering Ruben's from places around the valley & they made an exceptional version of it here. There was a good amount of meat & it was very tasty, just the right amount of sauce, and the flavor of the kraut balanced the sandwich out perfectly in between a lightly buttered marble rye. There was a tasty side of potato salad that tasted delicious, creamy & love the flavor of the red potato skins. 
Aside from the great food, there was Frank... 
Frank deserves a post all of his own. As we were waiting for our food Frank took the time to stop by and ask us how we were doing. He made us feel extremely welcome and took his time to not only welcome us during our first visit but provide us with more information about the company. I personally enjoy hearing about what companies are doing to reach out to the local communities & to understand their values. Frank I can see is the cornerstone to WBC & all the other employees were very helpful and kind. 

We will be back to see you soon! :)"}
{"text":"My experience today at Wild Flower was great! Samantha was very nice and helpful. I didn't know what to get and she helped me pick a very taste sandwich. She was very patient and helpful. Thank you again Samantha!"}
{"text":"Went here for another lunch. Never disappointed. If you like light and healthier meals, this is perfect. They have a wide selection of salads, sandwiches, and soups. So I usually try a different salad each time. Their food always seems fresh. And the employees are always smiling and friendly.

You have to get a treat if you go there! I love their chocolate chip cookies but they have tons of other goodies as well.

Great casual lunch place for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a business appointment today at Wildflower in Scottsdale. We sat outside as it was a cool morning. The patio and table were well maintained. While we were talking an employee ask us if we needed anything. She was very professional and friendly.
I ordered a smoothie after our meeting. I always enjoy the smoothies as I am not a big breakfast eater. My only complaint would be that it took awhile to be prepared and that the person preparing it came from the checkout area where she had been taking money etc without washing her hands. I will return."}
{"text":"Taking a red eye flight out of terminal 4, I was very glad to find this Wildflower store open 24 hours next to my gate. The staff was very nice, but they not prepared for the rush of Christmas travelers after midnight. They had salads, not no salad dressing. They were out of soup and sandwiches and I felt lucky to get their very last bagel. I also picked up blueberry muffin. Each were around two dollars, which is pretty reasonable for airport food. Both were very tasty and large enough to hold me over until I got to my final destination 10 hours later."}
{"text":"I have to say that dealing with Wildflower was possibly the best catering experience I have ever had!!! We placed the order late (I know no one else would do that) but they didn't blink an eye!  They helped us decide what would work best for our \"crowd\" and our budget and had all the patience in the world!  When we saw their presentation of the platters, we couldn't have been happier...they thought of everything--even serving utensils for the salads and they even helped us out to our car!!"}
{"text":"I received my wildflower gift card in the mail thank you so much. I used it to purchase myself and my daughter 2 delicious bowls of soup which was the green chili vegetarian I believe that's what it was called. It was by far the best veggie soup I've had. It had a nice kick a spice to it not too hot just the right amount of spicy. I recommend the soup to anyone that has a stuffy nose or has a cold it will clear everything up.  What's really cool about this place is if you asked for a sample they give you a generous portion to sample of their soups."}
{"text":"Wildflower; listen up.
There are certain veggies, spices and condiments that work well in a tuna fish sandwich.
For the benefit of your head chef, I'll list a few:

Tuna Do's

Mayo
Green onion
Celery
Jicama
Hard boiled egg
Sweet or dill relish
Lemon juice
Chopped bell or red pepper
Fresh dill
Lettuce (except radicchio)
Olive oil
Canola oil
Salt
Pepper
Purple onion
Celery seed
Water chestnuts


Tuna Don'ts

Mustard; coarse ground, dark yellow deli mustard!!!!
Time out. 
DId you see mustard on my 'Do's' list? 
Of course you didn't and do you know why? 
Because no-one puts mustard on fucking tuna you idiots. 

What the hell are you people thinking?
Your bread is delicious. No-one can ever fault its chewy crust and moist, tender crumb. 
But your tuna?

Your tuna is so bad, it's like if they held a contest for the worst tasting tuna in the entire universe, (which they will someday and Trump will likely host it)  you'd win it hands down.
Seriously, biting into one of those little round mustard seeds with a mouthful of tuna just about gagged me till I wanted to cry.
It reminded me of that scene from the movie 'Big' where Tom Hanks was spitting out his caviar and wiping his tongue with a napkin."}
{"text":"This location has deteriorated lately with unfriendly, unhelpful staff and varying consistency of food. Twice I have refilled with coffee , taking no more than 30 seconds, to find my plate of food removed from the table. Today I took out a beef and gorgonzola sandwich, and later found the upper slice of bread was half missing. I will not return to this restauarant."}
{"text":"Laying over in Phoenix this morning I found this little gem of a breakfast sandwich station in the airport.  All the food is made fresh to order, no microwave madness here.

I ordered the Ultimate Breakfast sandwich and was glad I did. Loaded with egg, bacon, pesto, roasted tomato and arugula, this was a sandwich if satisfaction. The brioche bun was soft and very flavorful.

I also had a vanilla latte that was great. They have juices, muffins, bagels, and other sandwich options, but the Ultimate Breakfast sandwich is excellent.

Service was very good and it only took a few minutes for everything to come out.

4 stars

The song of this review is \"Leavin On A Jet Plane.\" by John Denver.  Lots of reviews coming up from Mazatlan, Sinaloa Mexico...stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Customer service is good. But as I was standing in line I noticed flies were crawling all over their pastries. Grossed me out."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The service was great. They let me sample a soup i had never had before. The roasted red pepper soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"This review is for the small restaurant inside the Phoenix airport - location. I stopped here for lunch before getting on my flight home. What a treat! First of all...every single person who works here is happy and friendly! NOTED! Thanks for the great service and the smiles in what can be a rather dismal environment. Secondly, the food was awesome. I had the BLT sandwich with chips and a water. Fresh, hot, and yummy. I also got a scone which I ate on the plane later. YUM! I wish I had bought a whole bag of scones to bring home with me. The area to sit in is clean and relaxing. I watched as they carefully bagged each order to go.... If I'm ever in this airport again I will come back. So I can try something different! Way to go."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Very fresh and delicious.  Pastries from the bakery as well are delectable and great for breakfast.  I'll be back to this gem of a spot next time I'm at this airport for sure.  Line wasn't so bad either."}
{"text":"Very good, clean, tasty choices.  The soup and sandwich combo is a great choice for a light lunch.  Both the Passion fruit and Green Tea Iced tea I had were delicious.
The Potato Cream Cheese soup was really good.  The BLT with smooth and creamy avocado was also 5 stars.
Great bread = great sandwich.  The Gilbert location is spotless with friendly service"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots in Scottsdale!  Great anytime of day!  Excellent courteous service. Great with substitutions!  Good to eat in or take out and good breakfast, lunch or dinner. Great sandwiches and salads. Good bakery too. Definitely a great casual staple."}
{"text":"This one is not as good as the one in Hayden. They have made mistakes on substitutions and do not seem to be as flawless with customer service. However it's a great central location to stop at if in the way home later at night and they still have great food just be careful if trying to substitute bc they may not be."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. The very hot manager comped my sandwich when the Android Pay didn't work. 
This is my new favorite location for WildFlower"}
{"text":"This is the place for me.  As someone who struggles with the demons of greasy and heavy fast food this menu has several light, flavorful, vibrant, and healthy options.  The flavor, execution, prices, and customer service easily exceed those offered by its predecessor, Paradise Bakery.

Wildflower has earned my regular patronage and allegiance and here are the primary reasons why.

- Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty menu.  Great dishes such as butternut squash ravoili, salmon alfredo, veggie sandwich.  
- Perfect place to help mitigate my guilt when I feel like I've eaten too many burritos or burgers.
- Free Wifi.
- Great breakfast menu. (Yogurt Berry Parfait is in a parfait class all its own)
- Very accommodating staff.  They aim to please and it shows in their appearance, demeanor, and efforts to accommodate any special requests you might have."}
{"text":"In two words: VARIETY and HEALTHY. This was my first time here although in the past I've walked by it loads of time. Had to stop for a bite to eat and it didn't disappoint. 

Looking at the menu is overwhelming, a good thing in my book. Everything sounds so fancy and delicious. They have a decent-sized breakfast menu. The place serves a mix of American gourmet with Italian favorites but with an organic twist. They have, for example, cranberry stuffed turkey sandwiches, egg parmesan sandwiches and a nice looking kale salad. The use of \"soup of the day\" on the menu is redudant because they have a daily choice of 6 yummy sounding soups. The staff is friendly. The place is well lit and cozy. Noise level from the mall doesn't seem to be a problem in the morning. 

So what did I order that was so great? I had the feta frittata, which looked like an egg omelette mixed with eggplant, zuchinni, bell peppers and roma tomatoes. The best part is, of course, the feta cheese... It came with a generous serving of buttered toast and papas fritas. For a drink, I ordered a chai tea, which is a tad overpriced at 3.95 for a small one. 

If I talk to my parents about how good this place is, with any luck, I'll get a gift certificate for Christmas."}
{"text":"Am I the ONLY person in the state who doesn't need to eat here?  Can someone tell me what I am missing?  I just don't get the hype.  The food is ok, nothing stands out as \"must come back for\".  I will keep coming, because my sister and mother are addicted, and I am sure there is something on the menu I can find that I will like."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years on and off and the staff is amazing. Food is great too. Patricia, Kristen and Alyssa are fabulous staff!!  Very friendly and knowledgeable on the food for recommendations. Also Rosendo is very helpful if you need anything once you've dug into your food and don't want to get up for extra napkins or utensils. He comes around and asks how your doing and if he can get you anything. Michael has done a great job with his staff and it shows.  Love it here!!"}
{"text":"Price for my fav salad is a little on the high side but it is quality food for everyone. Their soups are amazing and the V-12 salad is amazing if you love veggies like me."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food was fairly good. But there was an amount of issues that were kind of comical as to how bad they were.
My husband, ordered a ham and cheese sandwich. They brought out a sandwich without the ham. Seriously ham & cheese sandwich and no ham... But the waiter tried to make things better by bringing him a gift card and free dessert.
I ordered a kale salad with chicken without feta. I said it twice, no cheese no feta in case the cashier didn't understand one or the other. The salad arrived with tons of feta. I sent it back and the waiter promised no feta on the second salad. There was still some feta and they missed the chicken. Didn't realized they missed the chicken so didn't say anything.
Overall, the food was decent, but if you have allergies or specific diet, I would recommend to avoid this place and or check your food carefully."}
{"text":"Had a flight out and stopped by to get a breakfast sandwich.  Seemed a little disorganized.  I got my sandwich before I got my coffee. There appeared to be enough employees, just no one appeared to be in charge."}
{"text":"4 stars for the super friendly service. 3 stars for the food. 

The menu here is more limited than Wildflower's outside the airport - I wanted to try the Wildflower Triple Club, but unfortunately it's not offered at this location. They did have the Turkey Cranberry Walnut Stuffing and most, if not all, of their Classics. 

The food wasn't bad, my chicken lemon soup tasted pretty good, although I wouldn't say it was great. All in all, a decent airport option."}
{"text":"Second time I've been in the last couple weeks to get a Caesar salad (because I'm obsessed) where they have asked if I want the mushrooms on the salad and I reply \"yes!\" It's the best part!! To then open my Togo salad to no mushrooms  this is the only location somewhat close to me so I'm bummed to have this keep happening!!"}
{"text":"this used to be our go to place until they doubled the number of tables, outside is even worse! they changed from 4 star to 1 star cramped quarters. they brought in smaller round tables that barely have room for 2 people much less the 4 people they jam in the space. the 2 person table now can barely handle 1 with food.  

so disappointed... such a different feel there now.  we like people but not an inch away! Mgmt was dismissive upon our suggesting to bring back more square takes or at least get rid of 25% of tables so you can walk thru to your table. he said it helps keep the singles from using too much space! on to of that, staff were cleaning the chairs and tables around us, including the 2 chairs at our table while we were trying to eat. 

now they have 2 more spaces..hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! So happy!! Ran in quickly to grab a salad and got back to my office and realized the dressing was missing. So I called the store just to ask if I could come back and get a dressing, the manager Todd was so incredible and gave me a free salad plus my dressing!! The girl who originally helped me was equally sweet and thorough!! Overall great experience, clearly this store knows customer service."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast and lunch when heading out of town.  I almost always go with the Spicy Super Greens salad to take on a long flight (it also comes with a slice of fresh bread).  When I'm at the airport early, a scrambled eggs and passion fruit iced tea is perfect for breakfast before a flight.  This is one of my favorite restaurants at the airport :)"}
{"text":"This is some BS
I got home with my salad and there is no dressing. Asian chicken salad with ranch does not taste the same. Needless to say I am not happy with the service or product.
Grumpy evening thanks to wild flower"}
{"text":"Really love this place! I work near by and often call ahead to order lunch. The staff are so helpful and attentive. My order has never once been wrong, and the food is delicious!
The short bread is the best I've tasted and I love their braised beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I have heard of Wildflower Bread Co. for years now, and I finally tried it out today!! Per usual I called in a take out order of their cream cheese potato soup and a rueben sandwich...

First of all, I must say the gentleman that took my order was pleasant to deal with, and when I arrived to pickup my order it was all ready to go ... There were no issues with the order nor was anything forgotten ... So customer service wise I was a satisfied customer!

The rueben was quite tasty, but the potato cream cheese soup that everyone raved about on yelp was only okay for me ... I loooove soup, all kinds both hot and cold and I just didn't think anything stood out about this soup ... it was really just so-so/whatever for me.

Overall, for the price I believe the rueben should have been a larger portion for the price or the price point should have been a few dollars less around 7.79 rather than 9.79..... Same for the soup.  My total order came to approximately $16 for the soup and sandwich, and I think that is waaay too expensive to spend on lunch.  

Would I return and refer others?  I would return and refer others, but there was nothing exceptional about my experience here.  It was very good for a chain though ... Which is why I gave it 4 stars. 

If you are a soup aficionado I would pass on the potato soup  - it's really not worth the price for a bowl ... I've had better soup and a bigger portion for a fraction of the cost from sprouts.   I would return for the rueben because it was good, but I won't ever become a regular because I think it's a bit overpriced for the portion ... This is definitely no NY style deli, but fairly decent for AZ standards ..."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Love the employees & how sweet they are. I'm here at least once a week and never leave unhappy!!"}
{"text":"I need to dine here more often.

I usually visit Wildflower Bread Company when I have an hankering for a unique and flavorful breakfast. With that being said, Wildflower Bread Company is always a reliable choice for a fast, reasonably priced breakfast or lunch.  

Wildflower Bread Company offers a variety of items in a casual atmosphere. When you place your order you are assigned a number, you select your table, and your entrée is delivered to your table.  If you order a drink you self-serve while you wait. 

The portions are generous, fresh,  and reasonable priced.  Wildflower offers a wide variety of menu items to suit everyone's taste preference. I enoy the French Toast, Pancakes, and Bran Muffins. 

The staff is always helpful, friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well maintained. If your ever in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Line can be long but moves fast. 

The service is great. They had forgot an item from our last to go order so this time around they comped both our meals! 

My favorite is the walnut pan cakes and seasonal salads."}

Today, I decided to have the BLT plus with a side of potato salad on sourdough bread.  All I have to say is everything was absolutely delicious. The avocado spread and garlic herb Mayo were so tasty as was the sourdough bread. 

The staff is always helpful, friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well maintained. If your ever in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have the best penne pasta with marinara sauce and the garlic bread is to die for! Very consistent, always tastes just how I remember. I LOVE this place!! Awesome service. Super nice people. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best spot in the airport for people looking for a healthy meal. Lots of options with good bread for sandwiches and fresh salads. The wildflower salad is made with quinoa, a variety of veggies, and all over fresh arugula. Best option they have."}
{"text":"Wildflower is my favorite place to work away from home or the office during the week.  With free wifi and multiple wall plug-in's available at every single booth, you can set up there for hours (but be sure to buy food/drinks, don't be cheap if you're going to be there for the day!) 

The staff are great, always friendly and don't seem to mind too much when I camp out there for hours.  I like how brightly lit the place is, so many coffee shops are dim and dark and I would much rather prefer windows and seeing sunshine.  

The place does always get busy, which provides for some nice distraction and people watching on occasion.   If you are planning on working or reading though, you may want headphones to drown out the noise or come before or after the lunch rush. 

As for the food, I have a few favorites. I really want to like the menu better than I do, but unfortunately I have a hard time here.  I try to eat fairly healthy, but am always tempted by their pastries.  I can't eat lettuce (weird, I know) but I wish I could because the salads do sound fantastic.  So I'm still looking for my \"go to\" staples, but I have a few recommendations.  

First, the items to skip:  Chai tea latte  (I think I'm addicted to Starbucks, this one just doesn't cut it - not strong enough for me, but this is definitely a personal taste), lemon bars  -  lemon is my favorite dessert option and I just do not like these, they are too thick and dry.  I keep trying them too, thinking I just had a bad batch, but after several attempts, I now avoid these.   I had tried quite a few of the cold sandwiches, and am always left disappointed. So I tend to stick to other parts of the menu, but maybe you'll have better luck.  Let me know! 

On to the YES! side of the menu: For breakfast, the  Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata is awesome!  It is huge though, so share it with someone if you can (it's not great leftover, in my opinion).  The chocolate croissants are awesome if you are ready to splurge a little.  Yummy! 

My absolute favorite is the Wildflower Grilled Cheese.. mmm!  I've tried to replicate this at home, but can't even come close to Wildflower's version.  Three cheese: Swiss, Brie, and Cheddar...with tomato and argula.   Delish!  If you like grilled cheese, this is the grown up version that will kick your own to the curb.  

Their soups are really good too.  The best one I've had is the stuffed green pepper soup.  Get it in a bread boule.  Amazing!  But it's only served 2 days a week, so keep an eye out for this little taste of heaven in a bowl.  And... you can't go wrong with any of their breads, of course.  It is a bread company, after all!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here after a late evening run to the post office on Van Buren. Don't know if it was the time I was there (8:00 PM on a Monday) or the weather (storm coming in) but there weren't very many people dining...which was extremely nice. 

Very laid back, very quiet, very relaxing. I have been here before on weekend mornings when it's packed (still enjoyable though) and being able to see it in 'down-time' mode made me enjoy it even more.

Ordered the lemon penne pasta...something that's always caught my eye on the dinner menu but never tried. And one of their passion fruit iced teas to drink. You order at the counter, they give you a sign to put on your table, then bring the food out to you. 

Got my iced tea at the self-serve beverage center and made my way to a table. A few tables seemed a little messy but there was an employee busing and cleaning them. Wildflower seems to be one of those 'leave it...we'll clean it up for you' places. 

My pasta was brought out to me in a few minutes...by that time I had my laptop set up. One of the best things about Wildflower is they have TWO outlets at each booth for laptops....and free wi-fi. A quiet evening, internet, and pasta....what could be better?

The lemon penne pasta was wonderful.....penne pasta, spinach, and tomatoes in a lemon cream sauce  topped off with some fresh lemon wheels and a little mozzarella ball. Very lemony...you gotta' like lemon to enjoy it. It is served with some of their bread which was hearty and crusty...a perfect compliment to the tartness of the lemon cream sauce.

I didn't opt for dessert this time...all though I have in the past. Their toffee torte is pretty darn good. The desserts and baked goods are all prominently displayed next to the counter where you order so you can 'save room' for them I'm sure.

One more thing....I'm not much of a coffee person. Yeah, I'll have coffee but it all just kind of tastes the same to me....coffee is coffee is coffee. But for some reason when I've had their coffee on weekend mornings it just tastes AWESOME. Can't quite remember if it's called 'house blend' or 'morning blend' or something like that...but it's good. It's the only coffee where I can tell a difference. 

Just a very enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Been buying my fresh Artisan bread here for many years!  I don't think they have a \"bad\" tasting bread and when it is a bit chewy inside and crunchy outside, I'm happy.  I usually buy a large loaf of Ciabatta and have it sliced for my sandwiches, heavenly.  Just the right texture, lots of little holes, freezes well.  Can you believe this diversity of available breads?  BREADS SERVED DAILY: Caraway Rye- Ciabatta-French Baguette-Friday Challah-HerbHoney-Wheatberry-Levain-Nine Grain-Pasilla -Chili Rye-Pretzel-Rosemary- sea Salt-Rustic baguette-Sesame Paysanne Baguette-SourdoughVienna-Whole Wheat -Cinnamon Raisin and Nut, ALL amazing!!
Their soup and sandwiches are great too, but I do a 99% just bread takeout once a week.  My wife loves the scones and cinnamon rolls and all their pastries. Try anything that sounds good to you, it will be :)"}
{"text":"Five stars hands down!
Fresh, delicious & super friendly staff.
Manager walks around to ask if everything is okay at each table. We had questioned the spiciness of the turkey breast sandwich my niece had ordered.
Sure enough the bread contained - spicy mustard   Seed. He offered to remake the sandwich.

Excellent Customer service above & beyond.
From the order to the table delivery.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great Service.  Great Food.  Had a morning business meeting here and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Wildflower before, it's a cute, nice soup, sandwich, salad, bread, pastry place. This is a big, bright location. 

Lovely, savory food that always seems to be made with nice ingredients, and great bread - we often come in for a meal and treat ourselves to a loaf of something delicious to go - today, sourdough with rosemary and sea salt.  It's pretty reasonably priced, and the food is interesting. 

Try the spinach salad (I get it with no bacon), or the egg, tomato & feta breakfast sandwich on ciabatta."}
{"text":"Great food!  A little pricey for a broke mook like me to do regularly but yummy!"}
{"text":"This is about the turkey blt-plus. Im like cracking up at how absurdly huge the bread is on this thing. Was this sandwich designed by a human? Humans don't like bread to be 12x's the mass of the ingredients. And it wasn't even good bread. It's like a hard flavorless styrofoam-hoagie you'd get at any grocery store. I guess i had expectations for an $11 sandwich from a \"BREAD company\" sheesh."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write an update so soon after doing a review.  But I did have to comment about something.  We went back here to try them again.  They weren't as busy as last time, so that may have been a factor, but the wait time for our food today was MUCH less than last time.  It was definitely reasonable this time.

The quality of the food was about the same as last time (which was \"good\"), so give them a third star.

\"But you show four stars now\", you say.  Yes, I do.  Because of something I noticed this time.  One of the items I ordered was the soup in a bread bowl (again).  This time it came with the inside bread on the side, and the \"cap\" they cut out of the top to hollow out the bread.  Someone in management was listening here on Yelp!!  I gotta give bonus points for that (i.e. for the bread, and for management listening).  It is rare that management even pays attention to reviews like this (or so it seems), and even more rare that they do something about it.  Kudos to Wildflower for listening and caring!"}
{"text":"Things I love about Wildflower bread company:

Potato Cream Cheese Soup
Caesar Salad
Staff
Customer service

The last time I ventured in here was after some retail therapy.

I ordered my favorite which is the Potato Cream Cheese Soup with a half/small Caesar Salad.

Wait time was so fast and they were busy! A lady brought me the wrong order and quickly apologized and brought back the right order. I didn't even get a chance to be upset about the mix-up because it was quickly fixed. Yay!

I like that if something is wrong with my order (which only happened once) they will fix it. I also like the friendly staff and great food. I will keep coming here. :)"}
{"text":"I loooooooooove this place!!!! Breakfast, lunch or dinner- the delicious food & service here never disappoint! The ambiance is wonderful, fresh & inviting- outside patio seating is a plus! The friendly staff is always on point to help you find seating, bringing out your food in a timely manner & clearing up your mess (not that I'm very messy!! ; )) Their menu will change to keep with the season or just to try something new, while the favorites stay available. My usual order (not all at the same time of course!) are: Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata/Banana Walnut Pancakes/ Chopped Salad/Salmon Alfredo. Their baked goods are also melt-in-your-mouth  delightful! (MmMm I'm seriously salivating right now just thinking about all the yumminess!!) Lines may be long at times, specially during the breakfast/brunch rush but they move fairly fast. 

In addition to the tasty food, I love this location!! It's connected to Changing Hands so be sure to browse through that amazing store before or after your meal. It's also close to Trader Joe's where we do our shopping. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am shocked that I am barely writing this review for Wildflower Bread Company since I eat here at least twice a week. I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's  not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago they were running a campaign on Instagram all you had to do was upload a picture of you to share a good deed you've done in your community. I uploaded one and had the most likes, not only did I get $100 dollar gift card but they also gave $100 dollars to a charity of my choice! I absolutely have a great experience every time I go here from the moment when I step a foot in the building to the moment I walk out. Their atmosphere is comfortable and clean at all times! I like the fact that the manager is always helping the team serve the food and ensuring everything is ok with the customers. They are just amazing! Thank you Wildflower for always being fantastic not only with your customers, but with your community as well. I will continue to come for as long as I live because not only you feel my tummy, but you fill my heart with happiness :)"}
{"text":"Really good. This restaurant outperforms and does food
and service the right way. Hats off to management who
trains and develops it staff in basic manners, friendliness,
patience, and timeliness in their duties. 
My wife and I both chose from the salad menu and
both were extremely satisfied with the combination of
ingredients and recommend salad dressings, the bread
is done the right way. Panera gets all the publicity though
Wildflower \"ownes\" Panera in this market and could
challenge them nationwide though, why not stay local
and be the best in your segment? Keep up the amazing
outcomes your guests expect and appreciate !"}
{"text":"I was here tonight with my family and it was a great experience! There was a great spot to sit outside with a really warm fireplace! The food was excellent, but a little pricey. But other than that it was great. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Based on my last review, the owner, Louis, took the time to address my concern and offer me a gift card.  Now that is amazing customer service.  Thank you Louis for taking the time."}
{"text":"Their new menu, the Super Salad is awesome! The baby kale was very fresh, not to mention very healthy. They added tri color quinoa too. The cauliflowers and walnut were really nice addition. The staff was nice. There were lots of people in the line, but I didn't have to wait that long. The waitress kindly brought butter for my bread."}
{"text":"Best customer service EVER. This is a great story, please read along.

December 31, 8.30pm, we stop at Phoenix airport to buy a salad at  Wildflower and a drink. Both excellent and fresh. my 10-year old daughter manages to forget her luggage at the register as she carries her ice tea. We board our plane and only realize she forgot it as we land in LA. Panic moment. My daughter is in tears. I am very upset. I was lucky enough to have the receipt that had the manager's cell number. It's now over 10pm and I have near no hope that someone will get back to me on NYE. But 30min later, my phone actually rings and it's the founder himself. He found the luggage and he offers to ship it back at no charge when realizing we don't live in Phoenix. Amazing act of kindness. I offer to pay for shipping and his response  was ' do something nice to someone else'. Selfless, and Very rare in this crazy world we live in. Lesson of hope & kindness. There are good people left. Way to start 2017 as well!

Ps the food was very good too. Sorry for blabbing!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food at a reasonable price and fast friendly service. I had a chicken pistachio salad which is pretty big and had lots of chicken. I hate when I go to a place and they are skimpy on chicken and you have to pay extra for more meat. Anyway my husband loves Salmon and had the pasta salmon bowl and loved it as well. Neither one of us drink soda so we had water which made our bill only $20. Not bad! Well definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love it. Always fresh. Food always great unlike paradise bakery. And they have diet coke. My only issies if they read this. A small beverage is way too small. Its annoying to get a refill every third sip. Im cheap sorry. The internet is free wifi bit but almost never works.  And the counter people could be better. More than once I have stood there for a few minutes before someone came over. They never seem to be knowlegable about the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My wife and I go as often as we can.  The last time she tried a Halibut breakfast sandwich with egg and salsa on a crusted wheat bread and I had a cinnamon bagel with a fruit bowl that was topped with some yogurt and granola.  And of course we both had some fresh, hot coffee.  Very tasty.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"5 stars for what it is.  Go every week for muffin and coffee.  My favorite...Morning Glory muffins.  So bright, sunny, happy place to wake up.  Love sitting outside with the dog.  Lunches are very good, also."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick breakfast last Saturday and was greeted by a tempting display of muffins, bagels, and other delectable goodies, all of which I passed up in favor of something with more sustenance.

There is plenty of seating, both booths and tables, including a large round cocktail table if you just want to relax while you drink your coffee and read a paper.  Might be useful if I was a coffee drinker or a paper reader.  

Order at the counter, and they will serve you when it's ready.  I had the ham and egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, Taylor ham, swiss cheese).   Simple, yet delicious.  The ciabatta roll made the sandwich, of course.    There was so much filling, I couldn't finish it, but I ate every last crumb of that roll.

I'm glad Wildflower isn't too far from me, but I'm also glad it's not too close, or I would be in serious trouble here."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches.  They have a turkey dinner sandwich this time of the year that is great.  Breakfast is not their strong suit, but a great lunch place."}
{"text":"I really love this place from the standpoint that it is quiet and the food is good.  Everything feels healthy but the deserts!  There is not a lot of inexpensive food in Scottsdale so this is a find there.  Closest thing you will get to fast food within a mile or two."}
{"text":"GREAT bread (it has to be, with the name, right?) seems like more of a lunch than a dinner place to me. seems like women like the food more than men, but the food is good and healthy and the baked goods are decadent.  If you are a woman wanting to sit and talk with friends of food this is one of the places to go in Gilbert.   They have one of those machines to slice the loaf of bread you buy which is great if you are going to make sandwiches with it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, charming decor, and delicious food."}
{"text":"a medium-quality sandwich/bakery place. No better than Panera, can still get a good turkey sandwich here.

good place when you need to grab lats minute cookies for a potluck or a loaf of bread..."}
{"text":"How awesome is this:

We sat down to lunch and the manager came by to say they had an extra salad they had made by mistake. Would we like to eat it?

Even better: it was worth paying full price for. I predict we'll be back before leaving town to get another. Wildflower is everything you wished Panera would be. But it's better. There's a reason why it's always crazy busy: the food rocks."}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife and I both had a \"half\" of the roasted sweet potato sandwich, which normally comes with \"roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia\". Obviously, we get it without the mozzarella, and it's fantastic! The half sandwich is still big, don't know if I could eat a whole one.

We also both got a bowl of the vegetarian chili, which is vegan. It was also fantastic.

Lots of vegan bread options and otherwise (hummus plate, salads, etc). 

I appreciate that they use a wide variety of unique ingredients, veggies & herbs, that you don't normally find at most other restaurants. We'll definitely be frequenting Wildflower more often now."}
{"text":"Usually food at the airport is sad. For breakfast, the chipotle egg sandwich here was very tasty!! It was hot and satisfying. If you're in terminal 4, check it out!"}
{"text":"The Soup in a Bread Boule is hands down the best, tastiest invention ever!!! Sooooo delicious. I would recommend the Potato Cream Cheese!!! 
We usually order from the office, and this time around I wanted to actually come by the restaurant. Laura took care of me and she was soooo polite and pleasant. I love good customer service! Thank you guys for the great food and an unparalleled customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the years with my family. There are a couple of seasonal sandwiches and soups that are really good, but for a bread company they need to learn how to actually make bread. I feel like if you get any sort of bread aside from sourdough or wheat you are asking to break a tooth. Seriously!! I ordered the buffalo chicken tonight on ciabatta and the bread was so hard I used it to break a window! People make your bread softer, and edible to the average human with an average jaw strength."}
{"text":"I've been a Wildflower fan since 2010 and I only wish I'd known about them sooner. I'm officially a bread snob; pick a flavor, they are all delicious and preservative free. Now on to food...so good! The BLT plus is my favorite sandwich on the menu; BLT plus cheese and avocado. The soups are heaven  potato cream cheese  and French onion are my favs. The coffee will wake you up in a great way and the lemon ricotta pancakes for breakfast are all you really need in your diet. Did I mention the staff is amazing as well?! Don't waste your time on the other corporate sandwich shop, this local treasure is ON POINT!"}
{"text":"Solid menu, I'm sure everything on it tastes fantastic, but I can vouch for the chicken pesto & feta sandwich, salmon caesar salad, POTATO CREAM CHEESE SOUP IN A BREAD BOWL and pesto chicken with linguini pasta.

Perfect cafe for breakfast or lunch. Really casual and quaint atmosphere, the cafe is connected to a wonderful bookstore. Order at the counter and enjoy."}
{"text":"snowbirds suck,!!!!! 


I enjoyed a great breakfast,, The service was excellent, the prices are good,
The only annoyance was 6 Chicago snowbirds, you can tell because very loud and hadBears & Cubs jerseys on , they also turn their baseball caps backwards, which is totally low class this particular group only cared about themselves when are  the snowbirds gonna adapt to where they are, this is Scottsdale,,I guess we have to put up the snowbirds for another six months, good job wildflower I'll probably be taking take out,,"}

Small group of us plan to have coffee and breakfast on Sunday morning, keep up the great work, wildflower,
Scottsdale style service at its best,
Tracy the manager was amazing,
I like when restaurants pay attention to detail,"}
{"text":"We are just visiting from out of town and stumbled upon this place.  First off the food is really delicious.  Im vegetarian...no problem with substitutions and making it \"your way\" here.  Secondly...the employees were so friendly.  The girls at the register taking our order were so patient when I made changes to my order at the last minute and when I asked for a receipt after the transaction was complete (sorry we didn't get your names).  Martha, the manager, came out to greet us and told us to let her know if she could be of any help!  What a sweetie (I won't forget your kindness). Lastly, the employee who brought out my food...he was so nice as well. Great food.  Great service.  Awesome employees!"}
{"text":"Their food used to be much better at Wildflower of Arcadia. However over the last year or so their variety of soups has changed drastically. They no longer have some of the favorites such as french onion soup they rarely have broccoli cheddar and if they do have it it seems to have pureed broccoli in instead pieces of broccoli as it did before. Going along with the quality of the food served there's also been a quality of the service that has also gone downhill with the food. Their service used to be much better as did the food I would definitely not recommend going and wasting your money there on brand tasteless food."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here recently. I had the Cheddar Braised Beef sandwich and she had Chicken Caesar Salad. Although I thought they were a little pricey, the flavors were great.
I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from my turkey pastrami penne pasta with pesto.  It ruined my Friday night.  I came in at 8 PM.  Had diarrhea the next day."}
{"text":"Trista was the absolute best. Better than average fast casual. Location is really convenient."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely excellent! We commented while ordering that we would split two different breakfast offerings and the plates came out already divided. This was so impressive to me because we didn't ask for it; rather, the service staff was listening keenly to ensure they could provide us the best experience. The red/white/blue bread was delicious...so much so I walked out with a loaf.  Menu is sufficient in size and offers healthy options.  I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"For all those who will read this, i highly recommend this place to anyone! The food is always amazing and the staff is amazing! My family and i were here for breakfast and due to an issue with my bank, my card would not work, instead of just walking out and letting us go on our way to resolve this issue, the kind staff offered to take care of us! I was in disbelief that they were so kind and willing to help some one they did not know!   Thank you to the kind staff at wild flower!  So again,  if your looking for great food and above and beyond service and staff go to Wild Flower, you will not be disappointed!  And i want to personally thank Patricia the GM! Your kindness will never be forgotten!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done. 

First, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location. Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds. 

So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service. 

Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!"}
{"text":"Wildflower continues to please my palate and I have recently become an even bigger fan of their breakfast. From fresh baked bagels to eggs sandwiches on their fresh baked bread, if I need a big breakfast I know exactly where to go to get one that's delicious, potentially nutritious and most importantly, speedy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! Breakfast and lunch are so delicious and the bread is to die for. You can even purchase a loaf for home. The blackberry orange lemonade is awesome and unique! I sometimes call myself a foodie and avoid chains but I'll always make an exception for this place."}
{"text":"Chop salad, soup, bread and staff are all amazing! Delicious food that is very consistently good time after time. Wildflower is so much better than other bakeries, its hard to compare. Get the blackberry orange lemonade!"}
{"text":"Great food but service is insanely slow and unfriendly. Don't bother ordering ahead either, you will still wait 20 mins when you get there."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed the yummy Reuben and Triple Club Sandwiches and dined outside on the patio. The fresh artisan bread is delicious! We plan to come back to try Turkey Pastrami and BLT Plus."}
{"text":"It would seem wildflower bread company is uniformly good at each location. The sandwiches are rather exceptional each visit and prices that may seem not to be a cheap sandwich per se are alright because of the actual quality of ingredients and overall goodness!

Always a good spot to grab some food to eat there or go with..."}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood restaurant! The ingredients are fresh, the service is fast and friendly - menu is diverse and fantastic. Oh - and grab a brownie, they're awesome!  definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Good tasting healthy food is hard to find.  And to find it at an airport is truly shocking.  I had the Asian Chicken salad and my wife had the Caesar with chicken.  Both were very good and there were at least 3 other options.  Staff was pleasant and the food came out quickly.  Worth getting to the airport early.  They also will pack it to go.  I'm not sure if the dressing will go through TSA or not, might need to ask."}
{"text":"The Organic Steel Cut Oatmeal is delicious.

Excellent wait staff.

Clean

This is my third review and this restaurant is excellent. Today I had the Slow Roasted Tomato Feta and Egg sandwich.   It's delicious. I highly recommend it. There's great hospitality and customer service here."}
{"text":"I'm updating Wildflower to 5 Stars because I'm eating a chocolate croissant from there as I write this and it's making my hangover significantly more bearable. Anything that can make me feel less like stabbing something the morning after a bender deserves all the stars it can get."}
{"text":"I love windflower. It's like panera but a little different options. The wildflower salad is delicious and has lavender grains.... Mmm"}
{"text":"I.Love.This.Place.

Adjacent to Changing Hands Bookstore, this small local change is fantastic, a great accompaniment to CHB and a great location (Guadalupe and McClintock) for a break from errands (or in my case, riding my bike-right around here is usually when I need to take a rest and eat something fast). Really warm and inviting, it reminds me of a classier Au Bon Pain (you Boston-ites will know what I'm spittin' here). A fast food restaurant that is tastier, cheaper, and friendlier than most \"sit down restaurants\". 

The set up (going from the entrance from CHB, not the door) is first off a sampling of their bread of the day with either butter or olive oil to dip in. You have the line with bagels right behind the cashiers, and a small bakery case to look at such good offerings as Chocolate Pumpkin muffins and their scones and cake slices. It can be a mad house here at lunch time, many people opting to take it to go-their sandwiches go on average 6-8 dollars-but they are huge, fresh and top notch-totally worth the price. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of meat free or dairy free options for me for lunch right now (they have seasonal menus) but for all you carnivores-DAMN. Good soups too (I would avoid the weird, mushy tomato bread stuffing on the side and replace with chips-maybe you'll like it but I doubt it). They also have huge salads and pasta entrees for dinner times.

Their breakfast and coffee is where they shine. The coffee is available at the self serve and they have a huge container of SOY MILK (yes!!!!!!) at your disposal. They can make tons of drinks and have tea as well, so if you're into that, prices seem market. But you have to try b-fest once here. Serve till 10am on weekdays, 2pm on weekends, they have stuffed french toast fruit, frittatas, I mean, it is soooooo delicious. AND FAST. If you can snag a table. Essentially you should try to have someone grab a table and tell you what they want since turnover is fast, but there are a LOT of people waiting to snag your seat (so don't linger either-its just kinda rude). The drill is you order the food, they give you a special flag for the table (if to go, you just wait near the kitchen and coffee kiosk), your coffee cup, you grab the coffee and grab a table and they bring it to you when ready. Pretty nice! Oh, and the staff is relentlessy friendly and efficient-I really don't know how they do it.

They do have seating outside that is pretty nice and a \"trust\" option for their baguettes where you drop money off and grab a fresh one near the door so you don't have to deal with the line. So grabbing some bread for the week or dinner that night is a fantastic option as well."}
{"text":"The staff here is very thoughtful and hard-working they really seem to care that you enjoy your meal and that the order is correct and you have everything you need"}
{"text":"For airport good options of soups sandwiches and healthy tasty salads. Also have espresso drinks and \"fresh\" lemonades.  I got the quinoa chicken greens with
Pesto vinaigrette- tasty and a veggie soup"}
{"text":"As a former employee of the company I was severely disappointed with my service at the North Scottsdale location. It's clear the employees are not held to a high standard. We came in on a Tuesday while the store was not busy and both the shift leader and manager seemed to like standing around and leaning on the counter for the entire restaurant to see. When our food was brought out, they completely forgot one of our meals (there was only two of us). Neither the kitchen or FOH staff knew about the salad. After waiting another 10 minutes, the salad was finally made but the shift leader proceeded to hold it at the window while talking to the manager for another few minutes before bringing it out. I love this company but I don't think I'll be returning to this location. There needs to be some serious retraining of all the employees. Serious lack of urgency and customer service."}
{"text":"This location is the most beautiful of all the Wildflower Bread in Phoenix.  It has gorgeous glass flowers hanging from the ceiling.

The food is as beautiful as the decor.  The bread is always fresh and delicious, great selection.  The menu choices are varied.  My favorite is the Chopped Salad.  Each ingredient is presented in rows with the yummy dressing on the side.  A perfectly balanced salad that is not your usual lettuce and toppings.

This place is always crowded for lunch, even the outdoor patio is filled to capacity.
I have recommended Wildflower to many people, none have been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the staff did a excellent job as well. I would grab a light sandwich here if you are running by. I want to try he Albacore Tuna next time!"}
{"text":"Yeah I'll give ya 4 Wildflower,

The bread is awesome as many have noted and I like they're take on adding small little things to dishes (aka Mushrooms on the Caesar salad) which actually believe it or not adds quite the shiz-zaz to their menu."}
{"text":"we actually try to avoid chains at all costs but we were meeting some friends soon to be moving away, there for breakfast. but i guess i eat (he, he) my own words because we love oregano's, ra sushi....so maybe i should say....we try to LIMIT our chain dining. 
my ultimate breakfast consists of perfect pancakes, waffles, or french toast...or a light, fluffy omelet with toast/english muffin and honey....or 3 fried eggs over medium with grits and sausage (well, sausage before i stopped eating meat....damn this vegetarian diet). all i'm saying is, i like my breakfasts simple, but filling....and the coffee should be very, very, good. 

wildflower has great coffee. the desserts sitting there looked absolutely divine. but with the new year, we are trying to decrease our intake of sugar and bready desserts, so of course i order the stuffed french toast. 
it was good, not great. i like it when i'm not hungry 3 hours later, but i guess that's a good thing...indicative that their meals are geared towards not overstuffing their patrons (but looking at that dessert counter....holy pastry). my girlfriends egg/omelet thing with eggplant and other assorted veggies was also good, but not great. we don't add any salt to any of our food, but even this item tasted bland to me. 
what can i say, i should've gotten the lemon ricotta pancakes....
for the two of us, 16 bucks (2 breakfasts, unlimited coffee refills and one hot tea). not too bad....."}
{"text":"Kelsey, Gavin, Spencer, Brooke, and Jacob were simply amazing.  Very upbeat, happy, friendly, and absolutely a pleasure seeing them when I come in."}
{"text":"I have not been able to try Wildflower Bread until recently but it's reputation had preceded itself. I had this at a catering event and they did a wonderful job of adding class with salads in martini glasses. Although I did not care much about the (presumably) cobb salad, the sweet potato sandwich was a fresh take on a vegetarian option and quite delicious for meat eaters as well. The bread with olive and tomato in the center was standard bakery quality. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, I come in around once a month and it never disappoints. I like the booths at this location because it makes things cozy plus free Wi-fi is a plus if you have a smartphone or a laptop and need to connect. This location also has a lot of parking if you come at the right time."}
{"text":"Though this location gets busy and parking can be an issue during breakfast and lunch hours, I come in after the crowds and eat brunch or a late lunch. The food is consistently great and they will make it right if you're not happy. I've also come here for dinner as well when I'm too tired to cook and parking isn't a problem at all."}
{"text":"Average chain food + good bread = 3 stars

I don't avoid this place but I go somewhere else if I can."}
{"text":"Went there again for lunch, it was wonderful...we had the chicken parmesan, very tasty and i had the chopped salad which has chopped salmon, hunks of parmesan, red pepper, sunflower seeds and this really tasty basil pesto aoili...unsure what it was but it was the most delicious fresh salad i ever ate. and of course i always get the delicious green tea with guava. wonderful bus boys in the back, and cute too, they answer your questions about stuff and take your plates and motion you when there is an available table...the staff at this location is outstanding, the counter girls are so sweet and efficient. Thank you, the people here actually know what they are doing for customer service. I love the inner circle where you can hang out on the cushy chairs and read some newspaper if there is a line etc...good scones too, we got choco chip"}
{"text":"Customer service exceeds any other wild flower I have been to. The facility is kept so clean and beautiful. The only complaint I have is the timing on getting your food is always a bit slow. Other then that amazing!"}
{"text":"Spicy Super Greens salad is deelish! I usually grab one when flying through Sky Harbor. The service is always friendly and helpful and am never disappointed with the quality of the food! I wish you guys offered a gluten-free bread option but maybe in the future!"}
{"text":"It's weird to write a bad review for a place that I actually like.  But my patience is a thin at this point.  I had a \"gross out\" experience at this particular WBC (the Chandler Mall location).  Went there with my hubby and the whole place was a mess, trash everywhere, the drink station was disgusting (found something floating in my tea), flies around the table we were at.  I literally did not want to even eat my food.  I actually emailed the manager that day saying I wanted to give the feedback directly vs. writing a Yelp review, thinking that would be nicer and more effective.  He replied and was appreciative.  I didn't ask for anything, I was just giving them my feedback.  He offered a full refund of my meal and offered to send me a gift card so I could enjoy another experience.  I thanked him and said ok, I would appreciate the refund.  It's been almost 4 months and I've still been going back and forth with now a different manager (not really sure what happened to manager #1), trying to confirm my refund.  Oh and (not that it was a huge deal) but it took about 2 months for them to send me a gift card for $12.  I thought that was so strange.  At that rate don't even waste the postage to send me a super random and cheap gift card which I didn't even ask for.  Anyway, to this moment I've not received a reply to my last 2 messages and I'm just over it.  I will definitely not go back to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to grab my morning coffee and pastries at Terminal 4. 
Jonastine Garcia always greets me with a smile and goes above and beyond to ensure her customers are satisfied! She's an example of what customer service truly means!"}
{"text":"Their bread is outstanding!  The Ciabatta (whole loaf, which I take home) and the Ciabatta sandwich roles (which I order sandwiches for eat-in) is just the best I've ever had (up there with Acme Bakery in Bay Area).  I wish, wish, wish, they did a kalamata olive bread, like Acme. I've been searching for a 'Bay Area' quality bread place for ages and finally found it here. 

They also accommodated my request for Arugula instead of lettuce, and they will serve sandwiches on any bread they have on sale, which is a huge selection. 

Really is a nice operation."}
{"text":"Anthony is awesome!!! I ordered a chicken ceased salad Togo and left. When I opened the food, there was no chicken and I was pretty upset because I had paid extra for chicken. I called them and Anthony offered to drive over and bring me the chicken for the salad! He went out of his way to be an awesome employee. He also brought a baked good as an apology. Promote this guy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast to check out the new location. It is a very nice, modern place. However, the service was awful. It took them forever to take my order and it took a while for it to come out. I understand the restaurant is new, but they should have been more prepared. Besides the service, the food was pretty good, although I'd prefer Panera."}
{"text":"Busy cafe always seems filled with intellectuals, students and readers. Tasty creative salads and soups with freshness as the main ingredient... fantastic flavors in really simple foods like chicken soup. Maybe terragon or chervil? Mmm. I am not a huge fan of bread, but when I do eat it I want it crusty and artisinal. This place is beyond quality. It actually is better than Panera/Paradise. The food here is freshly made...not premade at a factory like Paradise/Panera. Coffee here is not an afterthought. Lots of blends and single source options keep Charbucks out of this plaza. Who doesn't hit the bookstore after eating...it is like marketing borrowed from Crackerbarrel. Buy me a new book before I eat and I wont vacate my table for hours. Come to think of it, that may be why the cafe is so crowded!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had lunch at one in Goodyear. Great food, great service,a definite keeper. You won't be disappointed with the BLT on Sourdough - the Bomb!"}
{"text":"Fair warning: The potato cream cheese soup is deadly! Just a whiff of it, and I can already taste the smooth, rich, tangy goodness. 

The proof: Saturday, someone's kid was slurping away on this soup while I was getting a manicure and, Sunday, I was compelled to find a Wildflower for family brunch. Thank goodness for this new location as it is convenient from church. 

(Tip: On our first visit, we saw The Big Unit himself chowing down with his girls!) 

We can save Wildflower for the occasional Sunday brunch, but if there were one closer to home, I'm sure I'd be eating there a lot more regularly!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whenever I'm in Scottsdale I come here for breakfast and lunch. 
They have healthy,  homemade sections like I make at home. When you travel a lot for work it's hard to stick to good nutrition.  This place helps me stay on track.  And the staff has always been super friendly.  You have a customer for life when I'm here."}
{"text":"Great food!! Try the turkey and Brie sandwich and the potato cream cheese soup. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I went fort first time yesterday and it was amazing! The customer service was great and it took about 5 minutes to get my food! I got a soup and it was delicious. And the nice lady came and picked up my plates for me. This place was so great i will definitely be coming back with my friends and family!!! :)"}
{"text":"Serving size was perfect ( not too big) but pricy for the small serving.  We had frittata and French toast.   Frittata was thin and size of small tortilla. French toast was 3\" squares. Served really fresh rustica bread as side. All tasted great!"}
{"text":"Another \"meh\" location in the culinary wasteland that is the Phoenix airport. 

On a short layover (like 30 minutes short) I ran through this place to grab something to eat to spare myself the salt-lick that is an airplane sandwich. I ordered a panini and specifically asked for one sans-pickles. Not only do I hate pickles but something in my allergies makes pickles hate me.  It took a while to make the sandwich (now boarding zone 2), and I was okay with that because I was probably getting something made fresh.

Picture me running my big butt on the plane, door closing, me opening my sandwich. Pickles. Lots and lots of pickles.  $10 sandwich in the trash and another $10 spent on a salt lick sandwich on the plane.

Here's the GREAT news:  I sent a Twitter message to Wildflower and was immediately contacted by someone. I called them when I landed 4 hours later and they credited back my purchase, even without a receipt. I like that level of customer service and, next time, will let you know if the food is as tasty as the customer service."}
{"text":"I worked in a mall for 5 years.. And I still love wildflower ! Always a yummy lunch :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and I thought the service to be super friendly and helpful and the food to be great tasting! My wife and I even swapped plates halfway through and I still had a great meal!"}
{"text":"Received a recommendation to check out this restaurant by one of the information volunteers at the airport.  I'm so glad I listened to him.  Got the chopped salad - it was great.  Fair price; so fresh and yummy.  Fast and courteous customer service."}
{"text":"Some days, you just want some soup and a sandwich and Wildflower is the place to get that. The staff at this location are friendly and it could have been because it wasn't busy that day, but the kid who came and brought the food to our table came back by to check on us."}
{"text":"the potatoes are off the chain.. a tad bit pricey for an egg sandwich out... but overall the place is good.."}
{"text":"The 45 minute layover at PHX afforded me only a few minutes after traversing the terminals to pick up a quick bite to eat.  Good ol' Panda Express had a line extending out in to the open so we ended up just next door at the bread place.  

Wildflower Grilled Cheese
Swiss, imported brie, cheddar, organic arugula & tomato on grilled Nine Grain
$7.59

Bought one of these and brought it on the plane.  That turned out to be a great move as the plane remained at the gate for another hour (which has nothing to do with the eatery) as we ate the sandwich still on the ground.  

I think the consensus was that this sandwich should have had some sort of meat in it.  It was a good but pretty small bite to eat.  Airport food will always carry a bit of a premium with it- this was worth it for the stop-and-go nature of my visit."}
{"text":"I think I like this place more in theory than in reality.  The idea of a great little cafe attached to a great independent bookstore is appealing.  The idea of fresh warm breads, savory soups, and light pasta dishes is even more so.  Unfortunately, this place isn't all roses in reality.

First, it is often annoyingly crowded.  So crowded that you may have to stand around waiting for someone to leave so you can sit and eat your food.  It's also not my crowd.  I'm often the only non-mom in the room.

The quality is also hit and miss.  The Lemon Garlic Penne, most of the time, is an amazing dish.  But a few times (say 3 out of 10), it's been so lemony that could barely finish it.  I also made the mistake of ordering a sandwich (I forget which one) on toasted ciabatta bread.  They sure did toast it.  I stopped after a few bites for fear that I'd lose a tooth.  

However, the passion fruit iced tea is great, the soups and pastas are generally excellent.  It makes a great little place to get a bite and study, especially if you're willing to go at an off-time like 4pm rather than 6."}
{"text":"Whenever I am running around in the Deer Valley area, I try to stop in to this location. They seem to be a little less crowded (for the most part) than their other locations and I've never had an issue with slow table bus-sing, etc.

The most appealing part of this chain is that their food is consistent and reasonably priced. 

Personal favorites for breakfast are either of the Fritatta's (Honey-Cured Ham and Brie or Feta and Roasted Vegetable) if I'm feeling the need for something substantial. If I'm feeling a little sinful, I go straight for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, sans syrup and slathered in fresh whipped butter and blueberry compote (ask nicely and they'll pony up extra blueberries). Blue teeth be damned, I simply can't get enough of these things - they are light and melt in your mouth with the most amazing flavor. I used to always buy a package of the mix on the way out, so that I could indulge in privacy, but I've only seen the basic mix as of late. : (

For lunch or dinner I'm a sucker for the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola Sandwich (perfectly rare Roast Beast topped with fresh greens, roasted red peppers, and just the right amount of cheese) or the Wildflower Two, which allows you to select any two from their daily soups, half sandwich, or salads.

If you don't have time for a meal, stop in and grab a loaf of yummy bread. My personal favorites are the Nine Grain and the Honey Wheat-berry. Or have some real fun and buy one of their mother truck-in HUGE soft pretzels. These things are so big, you could hook each side loop on to your ears and wear them as a mask... hey maybe I'm seeing a new super hero being born... pretzel man!

Any way you slice it, you should be able to find something to tempt your palette, so grab your table card, fill up your drink, enjoy whatever local artist they have performing, and delight in the world of carbs!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Workers were friendly. I would suggest a cleaning of the soda machine. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Outstanding chopped salad, fresh and healthy ingredients. Got the Thai Peanut dressing at the clerk's suggestion, it was really good. My friend also enjoyed the egg and bacon sandwich."}
{"text":"Breakfast frittata was great (ham and cheese), so was my husband's breakfast sandwich. Chocolate croissant and pretzel were average, but disappointingly, the Vienna bread was so tough and chewy that it was almost inedible. I would guess that there are better places to get plain bread."}
{"text":"This place blows Panera or Paradise Bakery out of the water. Everything they make is so much fresher than both Panera or Paradise Bakery. 5 stars. Make sure you get there for breakfast to try their Taylor ham, egg and swiss sandwich if you can."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for quite a while now. They have fresh delicious food and nice employees that are always there to make your eating experience yummy. So glad we have a good place to go for good food and happy servers. Thank you Wildflower people for making our families diner so easy and good. Yum!
PS yes the food is a little more costly, but that is to cover the quality all around, please don't change anything."}
{"text":"Thus is like many of the other open-lined bakery/kitchens.Pick your meal and a server brings it. But, the food is better, they have a more appealing selection, and it's become the go-to for friends and family. Try the protein breakfast bowl for breakfast. 
The wildflower two makes an awesome lunch to share (small), or a hearty meal to get some variety in your life. The Chipotle spinach plus or the chicken pistachio pomegranate are a couple salads you can try if you're tired of 'classics'  
Don't forget to hit the bakery. Check out their fabulous pasta choices for a big meal.

{"text":"Went here for the first time in years today. This place was packed at lunch and for a good reason, the food is delicious! I was seriously watching everyone else's food and drooling. I couldn't decide between the sweet potato sandwich or tomato soup  in a bread bowl. I went for the soup. Glad I did because it was delicious! Only problem was there was a big long hair on my plate when it was served to me. But I told the guy who gave it to me and he was nice about it and got me a new one right away. Not too pricey for a good amount of good quality food! I should add this to my list of places I regularly visit for sure."}
{"text":"Seeing healthier and vegetarian friendly options is always a relief while traveling! I had been to other Wildflower Bread Company restaurants before, but I think this was my first visit to the one at Sky Harbor.
I love it when places tell you on the menu if soups are vegetarian or not, always a big help to me. I got the half vegetable soup, and half brie tomato and pesto sandwich. The cashier was nice, no issues there. Was irritated though that I could not get a half salad. Both my mom and I wanted half salads, kinda sucks we could not get them since other places have that option available.
Another downside was that it took forever for them to get us our food. My mom ordered like 10 minutes after me and still got her food before me. Like all I got was a cup of soup and half of a simple sandwich! The lady called my name and i got all excited..just to then have her say \" your food isn't ready yet, it will be soon\". Like you couldn't have just walked up and told me that instead of getting my hopes up? But that isn't a big deal, was thinking out of hanger haha.
The soup was pretty good, I enjoyed it, not amazing though. Felt the same about the sandwich, felt like something was missing. I did like it though, just was not quite as good as I had anticipated.
My Wildflower Bread Company experience was not terrible, but it also was not amazing. I'd like to go to the location I live near to see if it is better than the airport one, which I would imagine it is!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Wildflower Village in Gilbert for years and I'm even more excited now with the healthier menu options. The new Farro Farmhouse Salad is delicious and is my new fave, second to the V12 Kale salad. The soups are always amazing! But my wish is that one day the will make their tasty pretzels half the size so they can be enjoyed at one sitting when dining alone  Can't say enough about the staff as well. Never had a poor service experience. One time at the ScottsdaIe Seville location I found something unidentifiable in my meal and the manager gave me a $20 gift card in addition to offering to replace the salad I had already eaten most of...excellent customer service! Forever a fan!"}
{"text":"Always love Wildflower. Food is consistently fresh and delicious. Tried something new today, sweet and spicy butternut squash salad, it was fabulous! Christian was very helpful and super sweet."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service.
I ordered the Sweet Potato sandwich, and the Pulled Pork sandwich to go. They were busy, but my order didn't take very long. Sweet Potato sandwich was really good. VERY different. Interesting to have potatoes in a sandwich. But it was delicious! I LOVED their pulled pork also. The flavor isn't as smokey like some bbq joints. They also didn't drown it in bbq sauce. That is probably why I loved it! The meat was so tender and juicy. It was slightly sweet, but not overwhelmingly so since it wasn't covered in bbq sauce. The bread for both sandwiches were nice and soft. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. Heck....I might make a special trip just to eat here!! ;)

The only thing I didn't care for was their potato salad which came with the Sweet Potato sandwich. It was meh. ^__^"}
{"text":"I have never ordered something, I did not like!!!!!

There soups, sanwiches, bread, bagels, sweet treats, and salads are GrEaT!!!! If you arrive at 3 or later, you can order some awesome pasta. I suggest the butternut squash rav., it is a bowel of creamy goodness.

The place is clean & the staff is friendly. It is also a great place to study or do work. They have free WiFi. Now that the weather is cooling down they have some outside tables to sit and enjoy your yummy food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what so many reviewers are raving about- I've had hits and misses here but mostly misses. 

I work nearby so I've ordered take out probably once a month for the past year when I'm not in the mood for anything else... And I haven't had great results. The food is 9/10 times lukewarm or cold when I arrive (on time) to pick it up, or it's not done at all and I have to wait another 10 minutes for what was supposed to be a quick and easy meal. 

The food itself is average, and would probably taste better if it was cooked properly (timing and temperature-wise). Maybe it is better and they use more effort when you dine in, but I've only ever done take out so I'm not sure.

Good customer service; people are always friendly and apologetic when I find curly black hair in my pasta, but with the consistently mediocre food and \"oops\" moments, I can't really give them much credit."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit the in-laws I always stop here. Wildflowers in general has the best sandwiches/salads/soups/breakfast of any fast casual restaurant. I hope one of these days they will be able to expand to the Dallas area as I would be sure to spread the good word."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today - seemed to have a great overall rating so figured it was worth a shot.  I ordered the open face chicken parm sandwich, and got a butterscotch cookie for dessert.  The chicken was moist and well cooked, smothered in mushrooms, spinach and fresh parmesan cheese.  It was really tasty and just the right amount of food.  The cookie was fresh and the butterscotch / coconut combo was just right.  I was able to sit outside and aside from being hassled by some incredibly aggressive birds, it was a great lunch experience.  Their breads and pastries looked really good and I can definitely see going back for something else."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Still 5 stars, but I just wanted to give Panera a shoutout for having vegan options. I hope to see them expand the vegan options - I would love to see some nut cheeses as an option for their sandwiches. 


Go-to for healthy, yummy, comfort food. Thanks to our server Stephanie who was so sweet and kind to my daughter and I. She noticed my daughter was carrying a Lego set and came and told her that she really liked Legos too. It made her day to know someone else has the same interest! All of the servers are usually really nice but Stephanie went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. 

The restaurant also connects to Changing Hands which makes this a perfect stop before or after hunting for your next favorite read."}
{"text":"Well, I need to do an update on Wildflower. Still love this place, but some things have changed from last season. They now have a new soup supplier and some of the recipes are different. The new chicken noodle soup doesn't compare, in my humble opinion, to the old recipe. Lima beans in chicken noodle soup?? Sacrilege! The vegetarian vegetable is still pretty good, but quite different from last season's recipe.
 My salad today was much smaller than usual, and did not contain all of the ingredients that are usually in it--mostly lettuce, and not even a lot of that. I am hoping this was just a fluke, and will certainly give them another chance (or two, or three). The opinions in my review are my own based on my most recent visit to this Chandler Mall location."}
{"text":"Wow! That is the only word I can use to describe the service and dishes at this establishment. The service here made me forget my overall distaste for America's next generation, the millennials. The kind and adorable young woman taking my order, her name was Alana I believe, had a great attitude and was very helpful to my dietary restrictions. I sat down after ordering and in a matter of seconds my food was brought out to me by a gleeful and peppy server. Would eat here again definitely; maybe even bring the kids after a good day at church!"}
{"text":"Great soup and sandwich shop, they have this blackerry lemonade yum!!"}
{"text":"Oochie wild wild (flower)
Oochie bread bread.....(company)

This place is always popping with patrons during lunch. I would say one of the healthier choices when it comes to eating out. I always order their half sandwich and half soup deal. Love the French Onion and the Potato Cream soups. As for the sandwich I dig them all. The portions are just right for me and truthfully just right for most of us.  Quality over quantity is what I preach; so quit stuffing your face until you feel like you need to pop (SEVEN - Ouch!). 

The place has outdoor seating except I wouldn't sit there since traffic around the complex is pretty hectic.  All that dust flying around means extra salt in my diet I guess.  Indoor seating is recommended, but during lunchtime -- good luck finding a seat. I wish the place would expand! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and I ordered the Cesar salad with salmon and capers. At first I was really disappointed that the salmon was ice cold. I asked one of the servers if I could have my salmon heated up, to my surprise they made me a whole new salmon that was nice and hot and perfectly cooked. What fantastic customer service I appreciate that so much and will return."}
{"text":"This Wildflower Bread Company store is fantastic ~ a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or even dinner!  I love a good cup of soup with a side salad or a half sandwich for lunch.  If there is a Wildflower close by, that's usually my pick of places to go when given other options based on their consistent good food and service.  This Wildflower seems to be one of their best in the Phoenix market.

***CAUTION*** don't park directly in front of the restaurant!!  The shopping center parking lot is designed poorly so there is a lot of traffic buzzing in front of this Wildflower with CRAZY DRIVERS!!!  They drive like they are insane and all 15 minutes late getting back to work or going to their movie.  

Restaurant ~ they are conveniently located just of the north 101 loop and I17hwy in the Deer Valley Towne Center.  The restaurant is always very clean and the servers are super quick to clean up empty tables to waiting customers.  It's not one of their fancier restaurants but the atmosphere is welcoming and friendly.  

Service ~ they are very quick and friendly.  They are knowledgeable about what they sell and will help you answer any questions you have about their menu, breads and pastries.

Food ~ almost everything on their menu is either 4 or 5 stars.  I like their  Turkey Breast & Brie sandwich on their herb bread and their  Grilled Turkey Pastrami on caraway rye.  Both are DELISH and served with either chips, slaw or their corn salad!  Salads choices: Mediterranean salad or try their new seasonal salad ~  Fiery Butternut Squash salad is very different and a flavor-fest for your taste buds. Soups vary by day but if available both their Artichoke & Chicken Florentine and their seasonal Autumn Pumpkin soups are very good.

Their are several places to choose when your craving soup, salad or a sandwich so consider going to this Wildflower.  You won't be disappointed and in fact you will probably start planning your next visit to the Wildflower.  I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Feel'n patriotic today with my red, white and blue bread :-) 

And I still have to wait on an empty table - this place is always so busy.   

You know this place is good for breakfast/lunch when the parking lot is closed due repairs by yet people are willing to park across the street to eat here.  

Hope to see you here!"}
{"text":"Poor service again.  I waited at the computer for call in orders and I got ignored.  As I stood in line someone else walked up and got helped  right away.  
The point of calling in was for faster service, not the case here.
Will not be back to this location again"}
{"text":"My first experience with Wildflower was when I asked a friend to get me anything she would recommend on the menu. She came back with a chicken pesto pasta that knocked my socks off! The basil pesto was not oily, the pasta perfectly al dente, and the chicken was still moist. The spinach and roasted bell pepper was the perfect addition to the party in my mouth. After that, I was hooked.

Fast forward to March of 2013, when I have moved 700 miles away from the nearest Wildflower Cafe. The BF and I were in Peoria for Spring Training, and I had a hankering for a light snack, a refreshing tea, and a place to hide from the blazing sun for just a few minutes. We were heading back to the hotel and happened to pass by this location on the way. Excited... I quickly made a U-turn and breathed a sigh of relief.... as I just found my relief.

I had a melon green tea, the chopped salad, and a cookie. All were delicious. If we were there before the game, I would have had much, much more. The quality of food at this location mirrors the location that I am used to (Avondale). It is still relatively new, so the booths are fresh and everything still shines. The staff was very friendly and the food came out very quickly.

Hoping that this new location is a success so that they can slowly make their way to California!"}
{"text":"This place was great, not even considering it's at the airport.  And reasonably priced for airport food!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty tasty!  It is very similar to Panera Bread Co. back in the Midwest.  The soups and breads are really tasty and the bookstore next door is pretty fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love Wildflower Bread Company. From the pancakes, soups and sandwiches. If you are looking for real food you can't go wrong with Wildflower. 

In addition, the staff is wonderful! I just had another great experience!!!

 Thank you Jacob and Kelsey for making sure my sometimes difficult orders are always perfect! Their exemplary customer service is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mixed Grill Sandwich and a bowl of Thai Chicken and Rice Soup. Wow! This food was amazing! This is the best soup and sandwich combo I have ever had! Bar none! Try it!"}
{"text":"The soups and salads are to die for. The price is in the middle, not too cheap not too expensive. The chicken noodle soup is amazing. Roast beef sandwich tastes amazing. Everything here has a unique flavor and combination of ingredients and it definitely makes you crave for more. The place is a bit tiny but you can always find a space to sit and enjoy. Clean and nice environment.  The breads taste awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Avocado spread delicious. I always enjoy a wild flower with a squeeze on a fresh Bun!!! Lol"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great sandwich shop,  but a little on the expensive side in my opinion.  But none the less good food.."}
{"text":"Bread-eaters.  EAT HERE.

This bread is so fresh and tasty.

Try ANY of their soups in a bread bowl.  All of the soups are hearty and flavorful.
The veggie chili is one of my faves.

The salads are pretty big and come with 2 huge chunks of bread.  Everything comes with bread!

Also give them a try for breakfast.

I usually get this egg, brie and apple frittata thing that is sooooo yummy.  And the coffee bar is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went back AGAIN and I cheated AGAIN!  

This time, I had the Harvest Kale Salad and AGAIN my deepest desires were fulfilled.  Yes, I was moaning as I ate...but I couldn't help myself.

Kale, roasted sweet potatoes, apples, BACON, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, green beans, apple cider vinaigrette, and so much more goodness on one plate.

I think I need a giant A to wear on my shirt!  Hell, I'll just wear a big W for WILDFLOWER!  She has become my mistress!"}
{"text":"Wildflower is a great unique place that serves up excellent breakfasts and lunches. Their portion sizes are huge so be prepared to be uncomfortably full or take some home with you. They are so much, and I can't stress this enough, so much better than Paradise Bakery. They even have delicious baked goods. One of my favorite things to do is go on a bike ride with my girlfriend and stop there for lunch or a late breakfast. They also have great coffee so go to them instead of the Starbucks around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Chicken Pesto which I usually customize to suit my particular needs. I'm kind of a food snob."}

{"text":"I love that you can review the menu online and see the nutritional information for the items as prepared and if you omit ingredients. I had the Turkey Waldorf salad, modified to be gluten-free and with lower calories and it was delicious. It was so fresh and flavorful and the portion was huge (which I love). I loved that even with a full restaurant it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear your dining partners."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious stuff here...Love the soup bowl...patato cream cheese is a must try here. Great service as well."}
{"text":"The sandwich wars are over!  Wildflower has vanquished Paradise Bakery.  At least in my mind :)

The sandwiches here are much more intricate and creative than the other guys.  My current favorite is the turkey pastrami.  It comes on a nice toasted rye bread with a mango coleslaw.  The mixed potato and sweet potato chips that come with it are just the right side.

Always clean and the friendliest service in the Valley.

Well done Louis and team.  You guys rock!"}
{"text":"I really like their chocolate chip scone.  It tastes great and really is quite large.

Also, it's nice that they have a selection of newspapers to read while you are there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to splurge on food. The customer service is phenomenal and always so helpful. Today though Destiney really helped my sister and I out, taking our order with patience, kindness and nice conversation. Destiny helped us picky eaters determine which soup to have with our meal. She made our favorite splurge place an even better experience! The food is always delicious and she provided us with fresh coffee. Always nice to feel special. Thanks Destiny and Wildflower!"}
{"text":"If you've had a wild night at a nightclub and you're looking to get some brunch the next day with a friend to share the details, this restaurant is not the place to do it. 

Even if you find a seat here on weekend mornings/afternoons you are right on top of the party next to you, so make sure your conversations are G rated because they will be heard by others.

The Tempe Wildflower gets so busy that I've sometimes left and went to the Chandler Mall location because I know I'd be guaranteed a seat there.

Also, getting in and out of your seat could require repositioning the table and saying \"excuse me\" more times than you'd like. It really is tight quarters here.

I don't know if the other locations are the same, but this Wildflower runs out of items on a frequent basis. It used to be it only served pretzels on Wednesdays and the store would run out by the afternoon. 
Now Wildflower serves them daily and they still run out, but the bigger issue is that there's nowhere to heat them. 

Anyone who's spent significant time in northeast knows the value of a good hot pretzel. Wildflower's pretzels are quite good but they come room temp and staff  won't heat them and  only give you the option of the microwave. Gross. 

And where's the mustard? That's a necessity.

I always take mine to go.

Cookies also run out and we're not talking an hour before closing. They run out early. 

Breakfasts are excellent and although lunch items look delicious, 99.9% of the lunch menu comes with some kind of cheese. 

Fruit cups always taste fresh, come with a yogurt and granola drizzle and a slice of carrot cake. The iced tea is excellent but I've heard mixed reviews on the exotic coffees. 

The whole rat race idea to get a table on a weekend takes the pleasure away from your meal (if you can secure a table before your meal comes out). 

Advice: Utilize that corner spot in the bookstore where they have those goofy novelty items and add some tables there. You won't even have to knock a wall down because the two places connect.

With all the free food you give their employees it's the least they can do for you. It's not like people are crowding that corner of their store to purchase, say, a weiner dog spiral business card holder. 

Oh wait, I bought one of those there. 

Go to the Chandler Mall location for more room/privacy/personal space. The food is nearly, I stress nearly, identical."}
{"text":"Great place for pastries and small bites.(treats)
The actual menu (especially breakfast) is very underwhelming. Nothing on the menu is memorable, and the options are very, very limited.  The inconvenience of not being able to order pasta options until 3pm limits your options even more.
The food here is not bad, it just isn't \"good\" as other options within a few miles. 

Can't give better or less than two stars 
Place is clean, and environment is friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Check your food- especially if you are vegetarian, vegan, or have food allergies. I asked for vegan potato and greens soup and the basil, brie, tomato sandwich and they gave me the potato ham soup and a ham and Swiss sandwich. 
I realized the soup issue after I ate half of it(probably because I was hungry and didn't expect and issue...I did realize that the soup was a little creamier than I would expect for vegan food and then I noticed the ham bits- prompting me to ask about it. The person at the counter apologized and was nice about getting me a container of the correct soup. 

I didn't realize the issue with the sandwich until I was on the plane. I was hungry still and ready to dig in- when I opened the wrapping I saw the ham and Swiss cheese :( I couldn't believe that both the soup and sammie were done wrong!!! I have to drop my review down to two stars now for my strict veggie and allergy-prone friends who would have paid dearly for such mistakes. 

There was a cute little kid dancing to fun music when I ordered but was she thaaat distracting?? This was the third time I've had a mishap from a server in the last three weeks. What's happening America???


Original post: Thank you for being open for us late night and weary travelers who need food! Appreciate the hot soup and sandwich offers- it will help me get through my next flight. Writing this as I sip on my tasty potato soup! Friendly staff too! :)"}
{"text":"Beyond obsessed with the chocolate chip scone here! When I am craving a sweet treat, this is what I want/need!

I love to meet friends here and sit outside.  My favorite meal is a cup of potato cream cheese soup and the BLT Plus (I sub cucumber instead of the tomato, ask them to leave the mayo off and sub brie for the cheddar).  It is perfection!

My son ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with the blueberries and a side of bacon and he was completely raving about his meal.  That's saying a lot!

Service is friendly and helpful, the restaurant is always inviting and clean and we always leave with a few shortbread cookies \"for later\".

I will be back to try the Chopped Salad with salmon ~ it seems that every person around us was enjoying one last time we were there."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here pretty often, me because of the best oatmeal in town and my wife loves their frittata. This time we brought our very good friends from Australia. A couple with their son. Peter, the husband is known for giving hard time waitresses any place he goes to and loves to costumize his orders. Cassandra, our waitress was awesome. Not only she took his most complicated order ever without any hesitation but made sure it was brought to the table promptly with smile and everything was perfect. I was very pleased and proud of this place and our friends were very impressed. They loved the bread, the food, the overall atmosphere and the friendly service."}
{"text":"I should have known better. I was in the mood for pasta and thought I would drop in for some penne alfredo, meatballs and a salad. At 7:00 p.m. the restaurant was pretty empty so I decided to get my order to go. The order was made quickly and I was on my way in about 5 minutes which didn't seem strange until I got home and looked at my food. The pasta wasn't even enough to cover the bottom of the container. I'm not complaining because the container wasn't full - it didn't even have enough pasta to make one layer of penne noodles. The meatballs were cold but the garlic bread and salad were fine. For $15 my meal was not a good value and I don't plan on returning. It's disappointing because the menu always sounds so good but the restaurant doesn't seem to deliver."}
{"text":"I don't know how in the world this place has 4 stars. It is definitely the worst airport food I've ever eaten and not at all what I expected from Wildflower. The bread was all stale. Sandwiches had minimal toppings. Everything tastes like it had been sitting in the deli cooler for several days. Guys taking our order hardly spoke English and one didn't know how to use the cash register. We asked for a couple cups of water and they must've been fresh out of ice. Worst $50 ever spent."}
{"text":"I love their butternut squash ravioli and their soups are pretty good. My kids like the salads here. I don't care for their bread.  Sometimes, when placing to go orders they miss an item so you have to be diligent and confirm the order. My son got a cookie and they forgot it. Tonight, their ravioli was warm-ish and the chicken parmigian sandwich was not a sandwich... it was a lot of chicken,
Cheese and marinara sauce on a bed of hard bread you couldn't eat as a sandwich."}
{"text":"This restaurant repeatedly has dirty and sticky tables.  Today my food was burnt again so I sent it back to have it recooked. The manage, Karen, was extremely rude and unwilling to address the problem.  I told her I thought perhaps the grill was too hot only to have her throw in my face the grill was always the same temperature.  Anyone who knows about cooking knows there is no truth to this rude statement.  If you want burnt food and treated with no respect by this manager this is the place for you. I will never return nor  will the other people in by party! The location for this wonderful experience is Arcadia commons on 44th St. and  Indian School."}
{"text":"I went here for the fist time and the chicken pesto was very good. My boyfriend got the meatball sandwich which he didn't think it was that great. The employees were very nice. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and do think it's a nice place to pick up bread and pastries. 
I don't enjoy their actual menu though- I've had the chicken parm sandwich which was served open faced and became a soggy mess. I've also had the chicken salad sandwich, which was tasty but just too large to take a bite of so I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork. I also noticed the lettuce on my sandwich was browning at the top so I skipped eating that part of the lettuce. I also think the food is overpriced and it takes a while for the food to come out. 
It's a nice place to meet up with people and enjoy their company but I can't give it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review about the place that I spend so much time? The food is great, the passion fruit tea is refreshing, not to mention the employees aka \"breadheads\" are fabulous and make it feel like a home away from home. The atmosphere is welcoming and well kept. BONUS! You can score a FREE mini lotion from the restroom. It's seriously the little things. Thank you to Michelle, Luis, Jocelyn and so many of you that make this place awesome!"}
{"text":"After another visit to Wildflower, I decided they're way better than Paradise Bakery, which is only OK in my book and thus deserve 4 stars. As I get on Yelp to update my review, I see I have an email from the founder addressing my issues! That right there was great costumer service and will make me a loyal costumer. I'm hoping to try the breakfast soon, those pancakes are calling my name.


*3.5*
I like it! Sandwiches are good, very tasty bread, salads are fresh and I enjoy the potato cream cheese soup. I've been to two locations and they get crazy busy around lunch time. While being busy is usually a sign of being good, I just don't enjoy ordering my food and then waiting around for a table, plus a couple of times I had the wrong food brought to me and it took a while to flag someone to correct it."}
{"text":"Just recently started working nearby the Phoenix location and I have to say this place has some really good food. The lunch rush is something to avoid but usually when places are extremely popular it's a good sign. Are usually don't like sauerkraut but for some reason I felt like trying the Ruben. It was awesome. It was a little expensive, 14 bucks with that and a drink, which means I will only be eating there every once in a while. The staff seemed toDo pretty well during that hectic 1130 time. 10 out of 10 will try again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Then again, I'm not one to complain about a lack of power outlets or convenient space to work on my laptop while I am EATING. Sorry, but it is really unfortunate when eateries with good and unique menu items get penalized because pretentious automatons need to multi-task in public. Wildflower is good, so deal with it.

I was really impressed with the freshness and flavor of my sandwich, and I just couldn't say no to a dessert since they had such a good variety of tea in the place. We ate here during what I would consider an off hour, though. I don't think I'd approach within 100 feet during lunch time. It has to be insane."}
{"text":"star deducted as my first selection was not available, nor was my second.

so i ended up with a 9 grain bagel, toasted, cream cheese.  and a blackberry orange lemonade.  the bagel was great.  sunflower seeds, rye, and a bunch of stuff i couldn't identify.  the drink was a bit too sugary.  not much lemonade, mostly syrup taste.

my friend and i actually stopped there the other day and got a couple bagels to tide us over for a few days.  they are large bagels.  airy inside, tasty, and crisp crust.  they don't keep for that long.

the breakfast ends at 10am.  the dinner doesn't start until 3pm.  so i was limited to soup or salads as my options, so i went with a bagel."}
{"text":"Best salad in the world! Wildflower chopped is awesome but honestly, it's hard to choose.  The people are pretty great too, always friendly and helpful. Can't say anything about the sandwiches because I can never pass up the salads, but the sandwiches look amazing, too!. Stop by, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I had the BLT and a side Caesar salad. The bacon was crispy, the veggies fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly.

I love the decor at all the locations and the people are always nice enough and helpful. Everything was clean, neat and smelled good.

It's a Corp kind of restaurant as you know, but it's certainly  one of the nicest!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for healthy sandwiches and salads. I love the chicken pistachio pomegranate salad and the chopped salad w salmon. Both are addictive!  It can get crowded at times but this spot is great for pickup orders and it's open later than most eateries."}
{"text":"My husband and I love meeting here for a healthy lunch. Went in today to enjoy a soup and wildflower salad with my favorite bread, the rosemary seasalt, yummm! Jenna, one of the employees noticed that the soup that i chose was not my favorite and made the entire visit better by offering a helpful hand via the bakery! Love this place and will continue to make a weekly visit thanks to the great food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Delicious food and coffee is excellent. Not Starbucks espresso but excellent. For $10 bucks I had the Spicy Chipotle Sandwich and it was really good. You get real dishes, with real silverware, they have strong Wi-Fi with plug-ins at every booth. They seem to be very organically oriented. I give this one a five star rating."}
{"text":"I love eating at Wildflower. It's one of my go-to places, if I'm traveling in the Goodyear/Avondale/Litchfield Park area.
Wildflower offers healthy (and some not-healthy) food and baked goods. You stand in line, next to the baked goods (YUM!) to go up to the cashier and place your order. You then self-serve your drinks and head to your table with a card on a place stand. You put that card on your table and your meal is brought to you.
Pros: Popular place, outdoor seating, fireplace with comfortable library-type seating, tables, booths. Great food! I had their Tuscan kale salad and it was quite delish! However, I miss the Emerald Salad. I didn't see it on the menu :-( My dining partners had a BLT and the Chipotle Spinach salad. The salads are served with a large piece of their bread. Easy ordering. Good service, great location. Their pretty quick, even when they're busy.
Cons: The menu is up on the wall behind the cashiers, so if you're way back in line, you can't look at the menu until you're up in that section. Limited close parking if the area is busy. There are other stores and restaurants in the area, so you may need to walk a bit for parking."}
{"text":"I had a kale salad and it was super delicious. This is a great, healthy place to eat at the airport. Fairly quick service. However, I had to clean my own table as it looked pretty dirty. Otherwise, very, very good."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the bread is freshly made.  Less than fresh bread can ruin a good sandwich!   I've tried a number of their sandwiches, a couple of their salads and the chocolate chip scones.    Everything has been very good.   Don't forget to try the bread samples they always have out.   Caution:  My husband thought he was being very 'good' ordering the V12 Kale Salad but with the dressing it is a LOT of calories (I looked it up later as a reality check for him!)."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious salads!  We like the Wildflower Chopped.  They also have good sandwiches and the bread is always fresh - big plus.  Bakery items are also good.

It's a nice option for airport food.  Other locations are much bigger with a more extensive menu."}
{"text":"This place is great I mainly go there for their soups they have a really nice variety of flavors I would highly recommend this place if you are a soup person although their soups of course are seasonal. some. 

The restaurant is quite large and is open late there's usually never a line waiting which is nice if you're hungry the sandwiches are great and really compliment the soups never had a bad sandwich or soup at this location."}
{"text":"Ahhhh where to start.. There has never been anything on the menu that is delicious! From breakfast to lunch to dinner, everything is very good! There pastries are just yummy! And that ice team, yum!  I have always had a great experience at this location! Thank you to all the staff for always being pleasant"}
{"text":"My 98 yr old dad absolutely loves this place. He gets a cup of soup which comes with a big hunk of crusty, chewy bread which my dad thinks is the best. Afterwards, he walks up to the counter and orders a loaf sliced to take home. My pesto chicken sandwich was fresh and very tasty but the chicken piece was small, barely 3 oz. The fresh potato chips, and sweet potato chips where fabulois. My husband surprised me by ordering a meatball sub. He is from the East coast where they are excellent, and he doesn't even like ground beef! Anyway, this was a \"southwestern\" version with jalapeños,  which my husband wasn't thrilled with. The wait staff yesterday seemed bored. They were efficient but not very friendly. The one woman kept carrying the plates of food next to her body which got her covered in food, and the food..... um...yuck. otherwise I would rate 5 stars. Prices are just a tad high. Almost $5 for a CUP of soup, but the sandwiches were about the right price."}
{"text":"Consistent food.  The mushroom soup is good."}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Company has grown on me through the years... What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it's quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.  Due to this convenient WBC location, I've been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!  

Lately I've been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.  I'm currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  I'm also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.  

While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table.  I'm sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.

I learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more \"private dining\" for groups.  I may just have to look into that in the future.  Keep up the good work, WBC - I'm sure I'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"I came in last night with my friend and we had an absolutely delicious dinner of soup and half sandwich. I had been here at least once before and remembered that I liked it, as well as another location which I also liked, but couldn't remember specifics. Fortunately, they give out samples. My friend didn't originally see anything that appealed to her but then she asked for a sample of the potato cream cheese soup and really liked it. She got that with a tuna salad sandwich, and I got a roast beef and gorgonzola cheese half sandwich with a bowl of Hungarian beef stew. We were both very happy with our sandwiches and soup and I would gladly go back again. I was impressed with the size of both the sandwich and the soup. I was very hungry and ended up finishing everything. It might have been only a half sandwich but it was stacked high full of delicious ingredients. The soup was in a bowl, not just a tiny little cup, and was very thick and hardy, full of meat and vegetables. 

Then why, might you ask, did I only give them 3 stars? Well, because when they brought her tray shortly after we sat down they didn't remember to bring her a spoon. I told her, oh well they'll be back in a minute with my soup, assuming that it would take as short a time as hers had, and we can ask them for a spoon. But my tray took forever to come and we couldn't get anyone's attention to get her a spoon so she just had to sit there waiting. One employee in particular kept going up to the counter where he would scoot my tray to one side or the other and play with the paperwork and then walk back over the cash register without bringing me my food. My friend uses a walker so she couldn't just run up there and I was on the verge of walking up and at least asking for a spoon when we finally were able to catch the attention of another employee who was walking by and ask him for one. Even then he walked up to the same counter where my tray was sitting and decided to have a nice long conversation with someone while we were just sitting there. I don't know why it was taking so long to bring a simple spoon, knowing that the customer could not eat until she had it. Thank goodness we weren't in a hurry to eat and make it to a movie in time. I was just on the verge of walking up to the employee standing in front of my food, holding her spoon, and ask if we could at least have the spoon so she could start eating her soup before it got cold. Just as I started to scoot my chair out he picked up my tray and headed our direction, thank goodness.  Next time I think I'll wait till after I've eaten to leave a tip,  which I had included on my receipt when I paid at the counter.

I decided to go up and look at the desserts at the end and they had a shortbread cookie for under $2 that looked pretty good. I bought one and broke it in half to share with my friend since it was plenty for both of us after finishing all our food. It was wonderful, although I think it could have benefited from baking just a minute or two longer to give it that delicious browned flavor and crispness. But I'm pretty sure I won't be able to resist buying one again in the future since it was so good.

 I hope we have better luck with getting the proper utensil to eat our food the next time we go there. If the food is as good as it was last night and the service is a little bit better I'd be glad to up the Stars to 4 or 5 ."}
{"text":"Bumping up Wildflower to 4 stars from three...

Since my last review, I've been back twice - both times I experienced wonderful customer service and new menu items that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend both the berry yogurt parfait and the chopped salad.  I believe that it's all about ordering the right thing off the menu, and I found my 'right thing' in the chopped salad... It reminds me of the Cowboy Ciao salad - only it's $8... That's right - I said $8 for a salad with grilled Atlantic salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  It looks like a piece of art when It's served; and then they come toss it up with a Pesto Vinaigrette tableside for you if you'd like.  What a treat!  I hope this becomes a standard menu item in the future.

I've also been back to Paradise Bakery and can no longer compare the two... Wildflower blows Paradise away in my eyes.  I will for sure return to this or one of the other seven Valley WBC locations again for an affordable, fresh, delicious meal real soon.  I may even recommend it!

****Free WiFi and delicious Iced Tea are additional perks as well as the mighty fine looking selection of breads and baked goods!"}
{"text":"Good food, unique brand, but $3.29 for a drink is a little pricey. I'm like c'mon????"}
{"text":"We didn't have a great experience here. The food was very pricey which I am willing to pay for high quality food but this just wasn't it. I ordered the grilled cheese and it was really just a greasy mess. The bread wasn't grilled enough and I think they used oil instead of butter on it so it was just greasy instead of crispy on the outside. Hubby got the Mixed Grill which I liked better than mine but still wasn't great."}
{"text":"Love the food. Sadly last time I ordered a ceaser salad to go and they didn't include the dressing which I didn't realize until I was back at the office. My only complaint really."}
{"text":"Hey there. New guy in town on vacation looking for some fast food that was tasty, found this place. Had good reviews, and i was looking forward to eating there. I feel like I was slightly let down.  When I showed up it looked like a good lunch counter. Many options on the menu, polite and kind knowable staff. The \"spicy meatball sun\" jumped out at me. This and a lemonade cost almost 12 dollars. When I got the sandwich it was tasty, but the meatballs were Luke warm and the cheese was just starting to melt. It also only had 3 meatballs in there. I mean come on a 9 dollar sandwich with three meatballs, like come on, there needs to be more substance. The bread however did hit the mark. It kept crunchy and was chewy without getting overly soggy. The sandwich was also advertised as spicy, yeah right. It kept my mouth bored. There were visible peppers on there but they were blandly pickled into oblivion. Like I know that you have to produce many of these a day, but the Subway meatballs are spicier. At the end of the day if you want to grab food there take into account what there is around. Everything here closes early or is sit down. Recommend for people who are just trying to get food fast and not go to mc Donald's. Could of done better. Personally, might go back if I need to, but I will likely avoid it."}
{"text":"Everyone is so nice and Drew made a great breakfast! They have so many options and everything is always really good."}
{"text":"Always friendly and consistent.  The food is great, and there are so many options from the healthy to the standard fare.  Prices are reasonable.  Even during the lunch rush there are always open tables and the service is still pretty quick."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mother. We spilt the V12 salad, Wildflower Triple Club, and the Thai Chicken soup. 
V12 salad was good. Very fresh with a big variety of veggies. I got the cilantro like vinaigrette with it. 
Thai chicken soup was alright. I felt it would've been better served over a bowl of rice but it had a unique flavor profile. 
Triple club! OMG. Have to say this is by far the best sandwich I have ever had and it's huge! A must try! 
No pictures. It I was gone too fast."}
{"text":"After having a horrible experience the first time at Wildflower, I am updating my review which is based on the professional response from the owner and the manager.  They reached out to me and actually took the time to talk to me about my experience in their restaurant.  I have to give them five stars for that.  We are definitely going to go back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"How did I miss this place? A friend took me to lunch here for the first time today. I love their food! I had the half BLT Plus on nine grain bread with a Bowl of potato cream cheese soup. My friend had the Turkey and Brie sandwich on Ciabatta with a salad. The Potato cream cheese soup was amazing, I would go back just for that! The menu had the perfect variety of items to choose from with sandwiches/breads/cheeses you definitely can't get at Subway, it was so hard to choose. They also had breakfast, dinner, and dessert items that I definitely need to go back and try at a later date. The service was excellent with a knowledgeable and friendly staff, they were patient and helpful knowing it was my first time there. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming as we had a relaxing lunch. Prices were mid-range, but for one person it wasn't bad for the quality of food and service that I received. I'm always leery of the restrooms in any restaurant, but their restrooms were extremely clean and stocked. 
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good airport fare. I'd recommend their sandwiches, since they have some great, hearty 9-grain breads. Salads offer interesting combos, especially the Kale Quinoa Vegetable madly. You can easily make it vegan by holding the cheese, and they'll add more greens instead.

The staff is very pleasant, and they have a stock of ready-made items and you can customize too as noted above. Very good coffee in the morning.

It's a little confusing knowing where to order (right, left of the counter, in the middle, I'm still unsure), and it'd be nice if they had some tofu or mushrooms, re: more heartier veggies."}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Company is like Pandera Bread or Cosi on steroids.  Everything is simply better and doesn't cost more.

i had a chicken pesto sandwich with pumpkin soup for lunch.  wow. wow. wow.  A real chicken breast right there in my sandwich with a fresh roll around it, not chucked nor reformed nor anything but tasty and real.  The pesto was excellent.  the soup had vegetable chunks and slices in it that were NOT mushy.  yum yum yum.

i went back for breakfast.  i had pouched eggs, bacon, french toast.  yes, i had a meal of left overs too.  The french toast was even better later, when it wasn't so hot and i could taste how delicious the bread is.

The staff is clean and friendly offering excellent service."}
{"text":"While my order to-go wasn't perfect the staff was amazing and the manager reached out to make everything right. We are all human and sometimes move to fast and it's the businesses that show they care about their customers that will have me as their customer for life. 

Way to go Wildflower! Y'all get what customer service is all about!

The BLT Plus is AMAZING and the Wildflower salad with Lavender and sunflower seeds is exactly what a salad should taste like."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli. The butternut squash salad is also wonderful and the staff had no problem removing the dairy from the recipe for my order. I also really enjoyed the sea salt and Rosemary loaf of bread that I took Home to use for chili. The bread will keep for about seven days in the fridge. It's important to keep it in the fridge or freezer because they use no preservatives or additives which is wonderful to find! This place also offers a few vegan options but if you want to get the butternut squash ravioli vegan you're going to have to get it without sauce I would not recommend a Marinera since it does not blend well with butternut squash's ravioli having cinnamon in it"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place... amazing. I was a bit disappointed not to get the butternut squash ravioli but they don't  start serving pastas until after 3. I got the seasonal butternut squash salad and it was fantastic! Service is much like Panera. Order at the front take a number and they bring food to your table."}
{"text":"I came here for first time. Ordered vegetarian breakfast. I absolutely loved it. Staff is super friendly. And service is fast, not much of wait time."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive staff and competitive prices. Well worth a try!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at wildflower in flagstaff. It was wonderful. I decided to try this one and it wasn't even like the same restaurant. Worst meal I've had in some time. Bread was under toasted ,bacon fatty ,very little lettuce      Bad experience !!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a So Cal girl, visiting AZ... and I feel that this place is an upscale Panera / Corner Bakery Cafe...  This place has a great menu selection of soups, sandwiches, salads, and an array of bakery items. Upon walking in, they had a sample of their cinnamon raisin roll... Oh wow! They had me at first bite. I loved it! 

After taking a good, long look at the menu, and offering several customers to go ahead of me, I ordered the sweet potato and green bowl. I even had the choice to choose the bread I wanted that came with my order... again there was an array of bread selections.. from artisan bread to 9 grain to toast. I chose Honey & Oat bread. Sounds perfect w/my sweet potato & green bowl. 

My friends who ordered the \"Artisan bread\" loved it!! It was super thick, at least 2 1/2 inches, toasted, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside... mmm. 

This place is so generous with their portions. We were all amazed and didn't think we could finish our meals... the salads, sandwiches, the bowls, they are all generous portions. 

Service also was great. The girl at the cashier, to the bus boys, and servers, they are all great! 
I'm so glad I found this place and will definitely be back if I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"7:45am and the food tasted like it had been sitting for two days.  Only thing to buy close to Gate A11."}
{"text":"Brilliant customer service (the gentleman who runs the food is a legend), impeccable food quality, fresh brewed floral iced tea, a stunning array of pastries and speciality beverages, ample comfortable seating, great atmosphere for catching up with friends or having a meeting over a meal. I'm always more than satisfied when I come to this location!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Last night at the Yelp party, I tried their roasted sweet potatoe and was craving it, so I ordered the roast sweet potatoe sandwich tonight with the potato cream cheese soup. I never order anything vegetarian ever but that sandwich sounded so good and it did not disappoint at all! The sandwich had roasted sweet potatoes, tomatoes, arugula, fennel, fig jam, goat cheese  and a balsamic vinaigrette on focaccia. The tartness of the goat cheese balanced the sweetness of the fig jam and the nuttiness of the arugula. Everything went so well with the roasted sweet potatoe and the herb focaccia. I would seriously order this every time and not be upset that there was no meat on it. The potatoe cream cheese soup was good. It was creamy with a thinner texture to it. It had teeny tiny bits of potatoes in it. I wish it had bigger chunks in it. I don't know if it normally has larger pieces in it and I just got the end of the pot since I came at closing. 

I was eyeballing all the dessert options and decided to forgo since I'm trying to cut back on the sugar, but they looked so scrumptious! Especially, the old fashion toffee pie! OMG. In hindsight I should have just ordered it and cut the sugar tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I'm changing my rating due to the very thoughtful and detailed message I received from the owner of this Wildflower.  Not only did he write to address my concerns, he asked for my individual feedback on their menu and went WAY above and beyond in his offer to 'make right' my experiences there. I also learned there might be better options to suit my taste that I can order. Anyone that cares that much about their customers deserves praise. I will be giving them another try."}
{"text":"Super Chop salad, great tea, very nice customer service... I look forward to coming again :)"}
{"text":"In the battle of Wildflower Bread Company and Paradise Bakery, Wildflower wins hands down.  The food is fresh, from scratch, with tasty, fresh produce. Paradise, by comparison, seems mass-produced, stale, and straight from a can.

Wildflower has decent breakfasts, great sandwiches, very creative salads with generous portions, different soups every day, and after 3pm some great pastas.   The food and the menu and both fresh, they seem to have intriguing new salads and pastas every few months.

Case in point, the Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate Salad: on paper, it's a wild combination of arugula, a touch of cabbage, sliced chicken, chunks of orange, some peppers, kalamata, feta, and pistachios.  It sounds wild, but it's tasty and refreshing, with something different in every bite."}
{"text":"enjoyed the Cuban sandwich.  great for a stopover.  tasty with nontraditional pressed bread made crisp.  nice amount of spice."}
{"text":"First time eating here. There was so many options I didnt know what to get. This visit i made it simple and ordered a vegetable beef soup and chicken salad. Both were really good and flavorful. To drink i got the passion fruit tea which was good as well. They do offer a breakfast menu as well as take call in orders. Definitely a place I would like to try again."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, weak for breakfast (stick with Starbucks down the hall).

The have a nice potato soup and good sandwiches for lunch.

Breakfast scrambled eggs are bland and way overcooked. The accompanying potato are mushy.

Lunch - go ahead and enjoy.
Breakfast - keep walking."}
{"text":"THE STORY

I was in a hurry and stopped by the corner McDonald's for a quick cup of coffee and breakfast, and they didn't even have a breakfast menu up to order from. So, I left McDonald's and went next door to Wildflower Bread Company, which is what I should have done to begin with.

I walked into Wildflower Bread Company and was greeted with a happy \"Good Morning!\" by two different employees, including Jason. 

The store was big and bright and had tons of treats in the front cases. There was even Chihuly glass overhead. Wow! Definitely NOT McDonald's ahaha

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

The staff told me about the seasonal specials, including the chorizo fritatas, which sounded so yummy, except I had my heart set on pancakes.

I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and both employees at the front were so polite and told me they would bring out my breakfast when it was ready.

I only waited less than two minutes and was eating delicious lemon ricotta pancakes. 

I already love the Tempe location of Wildflower Bread Company 
(read my review:  https://www.yelp.com/biz/wildflower-bread-company-tempe) 
and I'm completely in love with this location now too!

CONCLUSION

I've said it before and I'll say it again: You can tell everything you need to know about the management of a company by how the employees treat the customers.

And Wildflower Bread Company must have awesome management!

I see established Yelpers agree with me too! 

Wildflower Bread Company is definitely worth checking out!

{"text":"I had a great experience when I catered a party from Wildflower Bread Company last week, Pat , the catering manager went above and beyond, she even let me bring my own bowl in and put the chopped salad in it for me!!!
So helpful and the food was AMAZING
I would highly recommend catering from Wildflower, thank you Pat"}
{"text":"Quality of the food served here is simply great! I tried the chicken and pesto sandwich and i loved it. 1 star short is because of the bread... too hard to bite into it. My jaws were hurting halfway through my sandwich."}
{"text":"Jennifer was awesome. She let me sample the white bean kale soup, was super couteous, and polite. This store, #17 in the terminal by southwest and americam is super clean and good amount of outlets"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My order has never been messed up. Never had to wait a long time. The chicken salad sandwich & potato cream cheese soup is to DIE for!!!!!! yummy!!! They staff has always been very friendly. & clears our dishes out of the way. Lemonade is very fresh & delicious as well! 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Worse place I have ever been to in my life and I feel horrible cause the staff is so friggin nice and sweet!!!!!! The concept of this place sucks ass Panera bread is by far the best between wildflower and paradise bakery but even better I wish this place was zupas. Nobody's fault except the moron who thought of it and designed the recipes. Staff was amazing once again!!!!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and just ventured over to Wildflower for my first lunch! What a pleasant surprise! The food is great-ingredients fresh, bread fantastic and the meatball sandwich my husband ordered-\"one of the best.\" It was a busy Saturday and lots of kids and families were there, but no waiting in line to take our order and the food was at the table in less than 10 minutes. I will definitely be a regular-the prices were great and food was memorable! I like salads and the choices were amazing-I had the salmon chopped salad and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"when you need to give in to carb cravings, this is the place to go, my kids love this and so do I when I can give in to the almighty bread"}
{"text":"I was at Changing Hands Bookstore during my lunch hour and remembered that Wildflower Bread Company was right next door, and thought oohh a sandwich sounds delish!

After checking out the menu I went with the roast beef & gorgonzola sandwich and switched out the potato salad side for coleslaw.

The sandwich is on sourdough bread and has rare cut of roast beef, gorgonzola, roasted red peppers, red onion and a tomato & herb mayo. This was an amazing sandwich!!! So dang good, like I am drooling just typing this up and must go back soon for it!!  The coleslaw wasn't my favorite, but the delish sandwich made up for whatever the coleslaw was lacking.

When I was ordering I noticed in the bakery display a carrot cake, OMG that's my favorite type of cake!!! So I had to get me a slice! It had carrots, spice, raisins, and a perfect amount of cream cheese frosting. Sweet bliss I tell ya!

 Wildflower Bread Company will  become a great lunch time spot for me."}
{"text":"While the food was good, as expected the service was HORRIBLE. I asked 2 questions about the soup ingredients, mainly what was the consistency of the broth. After pulling out a binder to find who knows what, the female cashier with two tone hair, glasses says, \"I guess I could let you taste it.\"  I then ordered half sandwich and soup. While the conversation was 5 minutes at the most, she smacked her lips, rolled her eyes. Maybe she was in a hurry to get to flirting with the cooks or texting on her phone."}
{"text":"Amazing soup!  They are so much better then Panera and Paradise!"}
{"text":"Chopped salad is delicious! The salad is basically a knock off of the chop at Citizen's Public House which is one of my favorites. If you go at lunch, the line is literally out the door, but moves quickly and the food comes out in a timely manner. If you're in a hurry I'd avoid at lunch rush or order ahead."}
{"text":"They are doing a much better job of cleaning the tables off quicker.  I have been here several times since April.  Their staff is friendly. Their vegetarian artichoke soup is great.  My husband is not much of a sandwich person, so I'm having a hard time  keep getting him to come here for dinner. I'll have to work on that one.  Keep up the good work Wildflower!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sandwiches are delicious and the soup is really good too. It gets pretty busy at times, but what do you expect when the food is so good? The staff is friendly and the location is good. A bit pricey, but again it's extremely tasty and always fresh. The portions have always been enough for me."}
{"text":"Yummy baked goods and food!  This WBC location is very relaxing.  I like the round lower table with chairs around it.  Feels like I am chilling at home!  =)"}
{"text":"You know it is the usual set up.  Tried the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin, WHOA!  It was very good.  I also got the 1/2 soup and sandwich thing (baked potato soup and ham/cheese).  It was good as normal."}
{"text":"I recommend a hot chai latte and a book from Changing Hands Bookstore next door. The opening to the coffee shop is inside the bookstore and you can smell the delicious smells coming from the shop. It is always super busy in the afternoon but they were pretty quick about getting my order out. Some things are overpriced for what you get. For this reason, I usually stick with coffee. A great day is shopping at the Trader Joe's, yoga, bookstore, and then a latte from Wildflower."}
{"text":"Came here today, of course. Haven't been here in awhile so I decided to give it another chance. The French onion soup was bland and tasteless compared to Panera. The cheese on top was ice cold, not even melted. I also ordered the Wildflower grilled cheese with ham grilled, so they only put 1 slice of  each cheese and the ham was cold. So different than what they were used to being and that was a great cafe, but that is gone!
I could've gone to cheesecake factory and got a better meal for the same price. $20. Wasted!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff. The food is good when they get my order correct, which is about half the time. I usually order my food to go and it sits on the food counter waiting to be bagged longer that it should. The pastries are usually dried out from sitting in the open. The breakfast is good."}
{"text":"In the Tempe area and need a tasty quick lunch with the bonus of tasty sweets?  Then Wildflower Cafe might be your spot.  I've been twice now and have enjoyed everything I've had.  Today, I got the grilled chicken pesto sandwich and it was tasty.  I actually like everything about it - mushrooms, red peppers, cheese, chicken breast, and bread.  Last time, I got a soup and sandwich combo and it was tasty too.  Both times, the lemon bar has been great!!

Even though I don't live in AZ, I'd recommend Wildflower for a quick, reasonably priced lunch.

Might see ya there."}
{"text":"Very good 2nd Time there basil pesto sandwich vert good there coffee well be going as I pass thought next time"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food, awesome staff, great experience.  I have been going to this location for years. My favorite time of day is breakfast mostly because the home fries are wonderful.  The potato soup is delicious for lunch.  ALWAYS try the bread of the month, you may stumble onto a new favorite.  Don't forget to grab a slice of desert before you leave. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality food and everything we've had tastes great. The problem with them is their service is SO slow!! The line isn't ever that long, but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes from the time you walk in to the time you get your food. Who has time for that? Also, their serving sizes have significantly become smaller. When I brought it up to management I was told people requested smaller sizes??? Not likely...bad excuse."}
{"text":"I love going to this place!!! The menu contains a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches. The staff is really helpful and friendly. Overall, a great place and good quality of food."}
{"text":"I have to say that their potato soup is the best I've ever tried! I'm just disappointed we don't have one in California cuz I will be craving this soup forever!"}
{"text":"Seriously this is my favorite airport quick service. The food was super yummy. We had a bowl of soup and sandwich and then grabbed a cookie for the plane. The line moves quickly and there is a good amount of seating/standing room with lots and lots of plugs to charge your electronic devices. I loved that they were open late as many times later flights are stuck with prepackaged snacks or vending machines. This is a true gem and I would love to see this in other airports."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Wildflower for years. Always good, and an excellent place to get a healthy salad. Breakfast is great too."}
{"text":"Love the food but you have to compete for a place to be seated here during lunch hour.  Sometimes you see customers circle or stand like a deer in the headlights hoping they find a seat.  They have outdoor seating but that's not a great option during the summer.  It's really frustrating.  I recently tried their wild flower grilled cheese.  Excellent sandwich, the side was ok.  For as long as I've went here I've never been impressed with the sides.  It's an area of opportunity for improvement.   The roast beef sandwich is also excellent here."}
{"text":"Best banana walnut pancakes in the valley.  They even serve the syrup on the side nice and warm to melt the fresh butter.  Tuna salad sandwich is also on my top five sandwiches.  Friendly staff, free wifi and plug ins for your laptop.  Could it be any better?"}
{"text":"Food is great, but watch out during busy times; seating is scarce and people circle tables like vultures waiting to sit down.  Favorites are Turkey Pastrami, Butterscotch cookies and Roast Beef.  Staff is great!"}
{"text":"Really decent food, with good ingredients - which is rare these days. The sandwiches are pretty good, but their soup is amazing. Garlic Tomato or Butternut Squash are my 2 favorites. They have more vegetarian options than most places if you're looking for that. On of my go-to lunch spots, for sure!"}
{"text":"I love places like this and this did not disappoint. All their stuff is healthy and flavorful with a lot of unique compilations of ingredients. Similar to Paradise Bakery but I would dare say better. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We were hungry.  It was 7:30 at night.  We were in an area with which we have limited familiarity.  How wonderful to discover a Wildflower nearby!  We know the brand is consistently reliable and good!  They did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Chill tasty food, with a location with a large room with opportunities to reserve for meetings! 

Parking:  This location is in a crowded strip mall area, next to Cycle Bar and other businesses, like a cupcake place, a shoe store, etc.  The parking can get busy, but there's always a spot, though not right by the actual restaurant. 

Service: Pretty good and friendly. I have also reserved the large room for meetings.   The individuals who helped me reserve were friendly and helpful.   

Food:  Simple and tasty - sandwiches, salads, good desserts such as chocolate brownies, cookies, lemon bars.  The salads are interesting with tasty dressing.  I have tried some of the sandwiches - unique options.  The bagels and pretzels are doughy, fresh and delicious.  

Atmosphere:  Simple, there is seating indoors and out. When it is cooler, I noted a lot of people out on the patio area. 

Cost: Cheap to moderate - $9 to $15 or so for meals.  I purchased a plastic cup specific to Wildflower in which one can get refills for the cost of a small drink. However, sometimes I am charged more. 

Large room:   For business meetings, the restaurant offers a large room that people can reserve. It costs during certain hours, but it is free later with a minimum food purchase.  The organization in which I am in reserved the room. All went well, though I had to request the loud music to be turned down three times. Also, this other group was still in there when had the room, and they seemed annoyed we were there, but we were there at the time in which we had reserved."}
{"text":"I can't really speak about the sandwiches and soups here, as I'm obsessed with their Chopped Salad! It's hands-down the best salad I've ever had. I substitute chicken for the salmon, but the flavors and textures of this entree are delicious. I love the pesto vinaigrette that comes with it, and always request rosemary sea salt as my bread choice. I'm a big fan of the feta and the dried corn that are in the salad too.

This location employs very friendly and efficient workers. I wish I knew the name of the cashier with wavy blond hair. (And I think she wears glasses.) She's the best! I always try to find an excuse to be around this area at lunchtime so I can justify stopping in for the chopped salad."}
{"text":"EVERYONE: Airport food is bland and overpriced.
WILDFLOWER: Hold my artisan, fresh-baked bread.

Okay, so Wildflower isn't gonna change your life. But there's a good chance it'll change your travel day for the better. And that's saying something.

This place serves genuinely good (not just airport-good) food, made with fresh ingredients, and some actual TLC.

I got the Cuban, which I dare say was up there with the best renditions of the sandwich I've ever had. I was skeptical of the \"imported Brie\" (Brie on a Cuban?), but I'll be damned if it didn't fit the bill and then some.

My wife was pleasantly surprised by her Vegetable Quinoa salad as well, and the woman at the register even threw in some fresh bread to go with it, at no extra charge.

I'd have gladly paid the same price for the same food out in the real world.

Well played, Wildflower. Well played indeed."}
{"text":"They burnt the hell out of my toast I was looking forward to eating ever so much! I couldn't believe it! So upsetting. To go to a location specifically for the bread and to have them burn it. :(

I highly doubt I'll be back to this location again if they want to burn peoples toast."}
{"text":"So i have been here twice now for a meal. once for breakfast and once for lunch. i tried the ham & brie frittata. i dont know if its just me or if sweet eggs just isn't that delightful.  yes...you read that right...sweet eggs. When i eat eggs i love them to be either covered in ketchup and/or hot sauce, or plain with potatoes. Wildflowers country potatoes or whatever were nice and had lots of flavor but the chunks were like eating mashed potatoes per bite. which i dont mind. but i still love crackers and co. so much more.  Now for the lunch i tried...the sweet potatoe sandwich might have been decent if there was not the fig compote on it. I just hated the sandwich. i had to take it apart and eat everything seperated. except i just took the fig compote off and scraped it onto a napkin. blah. i might give them two more chances as far as breakfast and lunch meals go. but the onlything thats keeping them at a 3 star rating right now is their Amazing chocolate croissants and their yummy blackberry orange lemonade. Yummm. Seriously Those are my only winners right now and their bread with a little bit of butter..."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, as it's near my husband's work. 

I had the Hummus Plate (red pepper hummus, roasted zucchini, eggplant, sweet potato, roma tomato, arugula and croutons with Balsamic Vinaigrette; $7.29) because it appeared to the only vegan item offered. My husband had the Portobello Picnic (roasted portobello, zucchini, eggplant, roma tomato, arugula and herb chévre on grilled Pasilla Chile Rye; $7.29), which would be a good choice for lacto vegetarians, or for vegans if they omit the chévre spread. I might try asking for it with hummus instead of the goat cheese on my next visit. It looked really good, and my husband really enjoyed it. The hummus on my plate was delicious, as were the grilled vegetables. There were two types of bread. One was a melba-toast-thin wafer that seemed to have been toasted with a lot of oil, margarine, or butter. Maybe those were the croutons. If you are watching fat intake, you could ask for that to be substituted with the other type of bread on the plate, which was a crusty French bread. The flavored iced tea (passion fruit, I think) was also very good. 

You order at the counter, and then your meal is brought to your table. The service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Nice healthy fast food in Terminal A at the Phoenix Airport. Lots of healthy choices and the only place for coffee at this end of the terminal. Not a lot of seating and feels crowded but a good value."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!

I travel to Phoenix quite a bit for work and sometimes have challenges finding lunch spots that are easily veganizable near my office.  Thank goodness for Wildflower!

I typically order their wildflower house salad and veganize it.  The portion sizes are perfect for a quick lunch, especially with the bread of the day on the side and an ice cold green tea!  Yummy!

There can be limited seating during the lunch rush, but I always manage to find a spot either indoor or on the outdoor patio.  If nothing else I grab something to take back to the office.  

Thank you for making my travels easier!  I am certain we shall meet again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience! Not only was the soup and salad delicious, but also the service was GREAT! Samantha went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was something to remember. She was pleasant, very helpful, and made my time at the airport ENJOYABLE!"}
{"text":"Top notch sandwiches with fresh ingredients on flavor-filled bread. The BLT Plus was a refreshing light meal that was sized perfectly for lunch. Prices were justified with the quality of the food here. Will be coming back next time I travel through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I realized yesterday, eating breakfast--my favorite, the Feta & Roasted Veggie Frittata--that I've eaten here so much that I can honestly say, I've tried the ENTIRE menu!

When I worked full-time, I ate breakfast/lunch 3x a week at the Deer Valley location and since I'm in Ahwatukee, my location of choice is The Chandler Mall.

Love this place. The setting is warm. The food is consistently good and I'm always happy with the service as well. They also get major kudos for putting \"build-your-meal\" style nutritional info on their web site. That way, you can deduct the bread or the butter or whatever you don't want to eat (to fit your dietary restrictions) and still have an accurate calorie/fat/carb/etc tally. Love that! Wish Paradise would do that..."}
{"text":"Love this casual little place! I usually get the roasted tomato, egg and feta cheese sandwich with a side of potatoes. Yummy honey! And the blackberry orange lemonade will make you want to slap yo' mamma because she didn't tell you it was going to taste so good. 

The banana nut walnut pancakes are AWESOME in my humble opinion.  I've also had a few different flavor scones, also good eatin'. I always receive great service at this place."}
{"text":"This sandwiches, salad, and bakery is a great way to grab something light for lunch. There's definitely something to satisfy any appetite. 

I went for a turkey salad that included green salad, Caramelized pecans and potatoes. It was refreshing and light, including also bread. If you have been to Panera bread, this restaurant will be in your comfort zone. However, it didn't feel quite as healthy since they don't include calories and some of their items were not as healthy looking. But, I felt right at home reading the menu. 

My other friend had the butternut squash ravioli which was extremely delicious and came with walnuts and bread. Great seasonal menu right now that I recommend trying!"}
{"text":"This location has some of the best staff in the hospitality industry.  Wendy is terrific - I always feel like I'm a welcome and respected guest. I dine at this location almost daily - and have for the past five years.  Give them a try - you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a regular place my wife and I eat at in the chandler mall. Great food and the prices are fair. Very clean and the servers do a good job. A +"}
{"text":"I love Wildflower Bread Company. I have never had anything that wasn't delicious there! They have these amazing pumpkin chocolate chip muffins that are amazing, their sandwiches are amazing, breakfasts are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Not only did they accommodate my post-breakfast, breakfast order, but they did it with genuine friendliness.

Every person I encountered here was pleasant and friendly. The store is clean, there's a large variety of options and the food is great.

I hope they will open locations in the other airports I frequent!"}
{"text":"I really like Wildflower Bread Company, especially for breakfast.  Their pancakes are to die for.  I also really love their salads.  Their sandwiches always seem a little to high priced for what you get, but they always taste really good.  I stopped in to this place with my friend and her two small kids, and a busser got us a high chair and wiped down our table for us, which was very nice."}
{"text":"Came here to get some light dinner. Was disappointed that they were out of feta as that is what drives the majority of my decisions. But the wonderful manager here popped in at the right moment letting me know they had goat cheese I could add  my man even enjoyed a healthier dinner for once getting the tuna sandwich. 

They do tend to go heavy on the dressings in my opinion, but everything is always so full of flavor."}
{"text":"The location at the Indian School location has really slid, again!!!! Unfortunately it only takes one!  I brought my friend there for breakfast....Greeted by Michelle, after ordering my friend said, \"She really needs to find another job.\"  She wont look at you while ordering, stares off to side and looks up at ceiling while rolling her eyes when you ask her a question. 

Order came out wrong even after confirming it with her.  

Even if in the area will make the drive to the Scottsdale location which is awesome and great customer service."}
{"text":"My mom took me and my wife there for my birthday.  The food was amazing.  I went to go get a desert, and when I said it was my birthday they gave me the cinnamon roll and brownie (for my mom) for free. 

He was so nice about, and told me to have an awesome birthday.  

This place has amazing food, but the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good option for an airport.  Had a  sandwich and it was enjoyable and makes for a good meal on the plane."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location every Tuesday evening for the last 3.5 years as a member of a knitting meet up.  I have found the food to be fresh and consistantly good.  I love the soups, but wish Tuesday's would have a better selection.  I always try to get my hands on a Red, white, and blue loaf to take home for breakfeast the next morning, but often they are sold out.  The best part of the dining expierience here is how accomadating the staff and management are."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. The menu is exhaustive and they use fresh ingredients. The bread is very nice too! They usually have samples put out to try. It can be crowded and messy on weekend for brunch, so you need to plan it well."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing. I was greeted very warmly and in an airport that's saying a lot. My food was made promptly so I could make it to my gate with plenty of time to eat before I got on the plane. I was given every dining accessory I could possibly need in my to go bag. Lastly, MY SALAD TASTED PHENOMENAL! I had the wildflower chopped salad and it was perfectly hearty and savory! The dressing was incredible (and I never eat salad dressing) and to add a bit of interest, they topped it with dried sweet corn. Genius! I can't say enough about the freshness and long lasting impression of the food and the quality of the service here."}
{"text":"Chopped Salad Never Disappoints!

Either the base (Salmon) or chicken delivers the right amount of protein.  I am a burger and fries guy, but this place is a great alternative and always busy (but not too busy).

Staff is attentive but not overbearing to flip/clean tables."}
{"text":"This one isn't too bad, but it is definitely smaller and busier than most. If you are near another one that's bigger I would go there first. Other than that it is pretty nice. Since it gets crowded the tables can stay a little dirtier than normal but they keep up pretty well with cleaning them. 

The food is the same great quality you will get at the other w"}
{"text":"Servers are friendly. The tomato lentil soup was very good. The Spicy Cuban was great, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Is unbelievable how they brought my sandwich with hair on it, I ask for a new one and their customer service really sucks. No apologies nor any care on their mind and to top it all she said she'll bring me a new one and all they did is move the sandwich a bit, remove the hairs and send it back thinking that I wouldn't notice. I'm no idiot, my advice don't even step in that hell hole."}
{"text":"I just called in a rather larger order for 7+ people at 12 pm. Which normally I would expect some sort of attitude or pushback for calling it in so last minute right during lunch hour, but we didn't get any of that at all! They took our order extremely well and had it ready in reasonable time. Then when we picked up our order, they double checked that all the food was correct before handing it over! And of course when we dug in to the food it was absolutely delicious. Well done Wildflower, all my coworkers are more than happy!! We'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Vegetable squash soup: 4.
Pesto tomato cheese sandwich: 2. Can't taste the pesto, needs more tomato as it mostly tastes like bread and cheese.
Portion size: 3.
Airport priced and sized: 2.5 - $10+ for a half sandwich and soup. $16+ for a whole sandwich and soup."}
{"text":"Love this place...consistently tasty breakfast with pleasant staff...Our GO yo breakfast place..."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, so good!!  The three cheese fritatta is a delicious meat free option!  And the bread is so fluffy, toasted just right, it's so tasty!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The manager at this location is amazing and personable! She bought my meal after noticing I wasn't having a great day. The food was delicious! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good portions, delicious food, and great prices. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Anything you order at Wildflower will be so fresh and they're always adding new seasonal dishes. The service is great and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The woman who served me was very kind. The atmosphere was very welcoming and cleanly. Price is a little high but its quality food so you get what you pay for. Great job!"}
{"text":"Great food love the spicy meat ball :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried the full restaurant location (only had eaten from a selected menu at the airport). The food was fantastic. You cannot beat their salads anywhere. Great ingredients and great flavor. The Reuben sandwich was great. It had a lot of meat on it but it was very flavorful. The bathrooms were clean and I thoroughly enjoyed the free bath and body lotion samples available."}
{"text":"Great salads, fresh ingredients. Only downside is that there isn't a full menu at the airport location. For airport food the cost is great and it's nice to not eat something greasy. It's easy to take salads through the tsa checkpoint!"}
{"text":"Whether your'e pressed for time or simply don't want to do the full service thing, this is an excellent choice in terminal 4. Terminal 4 is known for the vast dining options that are locally owned, which I love! 4-stars
For the food but the customer service is so darned friendly that this place is a 5 in my book. Traveling can be really exhausting so it's refreshing to have a meal inside an airport where the entire staff is smiling and just plain nice. 

I ordered the veggie quinoa salad and a half turkey and Brie sandwich with a bottle of water for $23. My meal was light and fresh and more than acceptable for an airport meal. 

They made delicious sweets too... so if you've got a sweet tooth be sure to grab a cookie!"}
{"text":"Ok breakfast, eggs were a little spongey, not a lot of flavor. The best thing about this place is the bread, obviously. Their bread is super flavorful and the texture is perfect, unfortunately it's not sprouted grains or fermented with healthy yeasts so I did break out with a rash. Their home potatoes were mushy and not very well seasoned. It's a decent meal, but not great. Big kudos for service and decor. The atmosphere is great. They even give you little containers of lotion in the ladies bathroom."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the new Wildflower! We got here by about 8:45 on mother's day. No real wait and easily got a good table with the family. Food was filling and tasty. Just wish they would put in a kid spot where they watch and feed your kids for you... Like at Harkins theaters.  Lol. I can't wait to try the new drinks too. I wish they had sugar in a pourable container, sometimes those sugar packets are a pain."}
{"text":"Tried the new protein breakfast bowl. AWESOME. Do yourself a favor and get this. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"This Wildflower is the most wildly random in what they do and do not provide.   I do not hand out such low reviews lightly but this is a cumulative review based on many experiences with this location.   I say \"this location\" because there is a second location within Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (near the high A gates) where I have not had any issues.  

Consistency is important in a restaurant and it's even more important in a chain.  When you go to one restaurant (or visit the same location twice) you expect to receive the same items with your order.  The WFBC menu offers a soup/sandwich combo and in the same section of the menu offers the choices of the sandwich and soup that can be chosen for this combo.  Beneath the soup it lists the soup as being served with bread.  At *no* point on the menu (nor any time during the ordering process) does it state this bread is not included with the order.  

I have, on many occasions, not requested bread and this was included with the order.  On other occasions, I have not checked and returned to a location to eat my meal and I have noticed there was no bread included.  Additional visits I have checked my order, noted the missing bread, asked for it and had it provided.  Other times still, I open the bag and find two or three sides of bread included.   This visit, the person before me ordered a soup & sandwich combo and stated during their  ordering that they did not want the bread.  I ordered and did not make this statement.  When I was provided with my order, the order was missing the bread and I asked for it.  This time, the person giving me the order stated that the combo does not come with soup.  When I pointed out that, at no point, does it state this and, in fact, lists in the same section that it *does* come with bread and that it always has previously she dismissively  shrugged and said \"I don't know what to tell you, it doesn't.\"

When I spoke with another employee back at our break room I mentioned my situation and they were surprised since they had gotten the same combo earlier in the day and had been provided bread.

Perhaps it may seem harsh to give such a low review over what some may see as someone following the rules and that's a fair point.  As an airport employee, however, I eat at the local establishments a lot and I expect to be treated the same every time I visit an establishment.  If something is so, it should be so for *every* order and if a customer brings up a legitimate concern and points out something like misleading signage they should be treated respectfully, not with such a dismissive atttude.

 If you only eat here once and don't care that their signage is deceiving you will be fine but I will be spending my money at one of the other restaurants just steps away."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was here for breakfast, but they're good for brunch and lunch too. I'm a vegetarian, so took a while to make a pick from the menu. The waitress ably assisted me. I ordered a Bagel with Cream Cheese, Quinoa Cranberry Kale side salad and a Green Ice Tea. Everything was very very well done. They had a variety of breads to choose from! I picked the 9 Grain Bagel, and it was toasted just right and filled with the perfect amount of cream cheese to go with it! The salad was a true winner and the right size for a side. All the flavors were spot on! I relished the passion fruit flavor in the green tea. And all this for $8! I highly recommend this restaurant if u r craving salads and breakfast menu .... anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my worst experiences with Wildflower ... I love this chain, but this Saturday lunch visit, my first to this location, was better forgotten ... long queues, not enough tables to accommodate the crowd, noise levels, and below par quality of food ... was a bad Saturday lunch!

But giving them the benefit of doubt, I shall try this place one more time ... hope to positively update my review then!"}
{"text":"I work in the mall and I come here all the time! Great service and AMAZING food!!! They have the BEST passion fruit tea EVER!! They're usually always busy during lunch, which makes the wait for food a bit long...but totally worth it! I have food allergies, and they're very prompt about letting me know the ingredients in whatever I am ordering! Best place for lunch and breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Everyone is really friendly and the food is so good. My favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"We love Wildflower and it's so nice to stop for breakfast at the terminal 4 location before we fly out. Have to compliment the crew Brittany M, Britney R, Alexis B, Jacob G, and Willy S thank you for your great service and friendly attitude."}
{"text":"Love the pancakes at Wildflower Bread Company. Hadn't eaten at this location before. It was top notch. Food was fresh, hot and delicious. The staff was friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for a snack and some drinks. We were greeted as we entered the door, and the place was clean and well kept. The cashier was friendly and took our order right away since we came at an off time and no one was in line.

I picked out a cookie and he had a cupcake.  The cookie tasted freshly baked and his cupcake was gone in a minute or two - so I think it's safe to say it was tasty as well.

This location is tucked inside of the shopping plaza and the parking can be a tad difficult to navigate with it being on the main path, but it's worth a stop off!

Overall: A
Good snack food, good service!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for outside lounging! With plenty of seat choices and wind chimes, we could have relaxed all day and snacked here on tons of options. We enjoyed the inside deco too but on a nice day in Arizona, who sits inside?  

We only stopped in for snacks - a chocolate chip cookie for me a red velvet cupcake for him. Both were delicious. 

Overall: A
Can't wait to try more on this menu. Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I was surprised at this place. I was expecting it to be a Panera Bread with just a different name, like so many have done. This menu was much better! Much more selection and it seemed you could get more for the price."}
{"text":"We always love coming in to the original Wildflower location.  Great food, and great service.   Thank you Anthony- you run a great store.  P.S.  the turkey-cranberry sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"After coming here two times, this will be my last. The food came fast, fairly clean restaurant, most things check out. 

The Salmon Alfredo is what I ordered both times. Each time I asked for the salmon to be lightly cooked because of their reputation of overcooked dry fish.

This was terribly overcooked. It is a shame and an amateur mistake. The sauce is tasty, noodles okay and bread okay, but the salmon is outstandingly awful. I would believe all of their other dishes are this way as well."}
{"text":"We always love the potato cream cheese soup!  Giving a few new things a try tonight. Stephanie R was super helpful in helping us decided what we should try. We went with the broccoli cheddar soup, rosemary chicken linguini and superfood salad. All look amazing and I'm sure will taste great. Was very happy with our service and how helpful Stephanie was."}
{"text":"I went for the first time and tried the Asian chicken salad and brownie.. The salad was just awesome.. Loved it.. Quantity was so much that me and my husband had to share.. Would love to visit again.. Staff was also very polite.."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian and gluten-free soup from this location and got home and had a chicken chili that was not gluten-free.

Not only is this horrible customer service and attention to detail, but it is dangerous to customers that have a gluten allergy. I will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"\"Upscale Panera\" is what comes to my mind. There are many similarities in the décor and menu. However, Wildflower offers table services. Food is even more fresh, flavorful, and tempting.

Chipotle Spinach salad was great springtime salad. Sweet strawberries and chipotle poppyseed dressing covered up the sourness from spinach. Bacon, gorgonzola, dried corn, and toasted walnuts added the crunch and saltiness the salad needs. Also, large portion of chicken breast.  (Hint, similar to panera's strawberry poppy seed salad)

Cinnamon Brioche French Toast was well made. The hot syrups was a huge plus. The two-piece in kid's portion left us wanted more.

Overall a strong 3 star!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. This is the second time I've had Wildflower in the past month and both times it's been sub-par. Note, the first experience was at the Goodyear location. 

Today I ordered the ham and brie egg dish. I'm not eating bread right now so I asked the girl at the counter if there was anything I could get instead of bread. She said yes, fruit. I said that would work. I ended up paying $1.50 more for the fruit (mostly melons). I was not told there was an up-charge. Plus when my food was delivered the potatoes were missing. The lady who delivered it responded, it says sub fruit. Okay, I subbed fruit for bread; who knew I was subbing it for half my meal. Oh, and they gave me bread too. Bad customer service all around. 

On to the Goodyear location. We waited in line for a rather long time and then it took 40 minutes to get our food, which neither of us liked. 

Oh well, no more Wildflower for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic bread, delicious sandwiches, and decent baked goods (my bran muffin was a bit dry, but cookies and scones are great).  The chicken and tuna salad sandwiches are awesome, especially the chicken.  It tastes fresh with big chunks of juicy chicken and a nice, creamy texture."}
{"text":"I had the spicy meatball sandwich and I can't complain one bit.  The price was $8, the portion size was massive and it tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Called in an order on the phone to go and when i came in 10 minutes later it was absolutely packed with people. The manager was helping a ton of customers in any way he could and got me taken care of in a very efficient manner and was extremely polite and thankful for the business! The food was fantastic and the service during the lunch rush was even better!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is slow. We've been about 8 times and it seems to get progressively slower... but the food is still good."}
{"text":"This place always has the best food and the friendliest most efficient staff.   No worry about lines, they get you in and out fast and on your way to your flight.  No stress!!!  They have it down!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Mostly quick service. Great tea selection. I can eat the bread like a prisoner breaking a food strike. Love me some bread. But I avoid it. Not trying to put on the lbs.  So... yeah. Go. Weekend vibe at this location is second to none. I love it."}
{"text":"I had an Mediterranean Salad, with salmon. It was delicious- but firstly it was beautiful esthetically. \"No pictures ?\" You ask. Um... no, so sorry to disappoint you. It was too good and I actually forgot . I'll get back on it...
So the counter lady that took my order was a cutie. She has purple hair~ sorry I dropped the ball on the name. She was patient and not hurried in the least. Adorable.
The girl that delivered the meal appeared frazzled and took too much on. She needed help~ almost like she had roller skates on!"}
{"text":"Wildflower at Seville, absolutely the best. Frank the manager went out of his way to accommodate my wife and I. I had ordered the ruben sandwich and had also ordered the mac and cheese thinking it was a side not knowing it was an entree. Frank brought  the meal and later returned to see if I knew about the mac and cheese. I told him no and he took it off the bill and brought me a box for home. What a pleasant surprise. Along with great food and people who actually care about customers I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to WBC but have become a raving fan. This is a new location and it's beautiful. The menu is filled with healthy options. Everything I've had on multiple occasions is fresh with quality ingredients. The service is outstanding and the place is always immaculate including the bathrooms."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. A great spot for breakfast or lunch. My favorite here is the Ham and Brie frittata with apples and leeks. The star here is always the bread products. Service is friendly and efficient. The loss of one star is due to location. It is annexed to a bookstore which is great but the dining area is tiny and because it's a busy spot, somewhat chaotic."}
{"text":"I had the wildflower salad with chicken and it was so good. The atmosphere was good, we went at dinner so we didn't experience the lines like it sounds like they get at lunch. The staff was friendly and it wasn't too expensive for 4 people for a decent dinner. It saved us from a fatening fast food place. I'll definitely be back.  When I'm off my diet I'll get the penne pasta which was what my boyfriend had. I tried the sauce and it was delish."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower! You can go to any location and know that you're going to get good quality. They're very consistent and that's most important to me in a business. The food is always great, and even when they're insanely busy it never takes too long. My fiancé and I have so many favorites here - my ultimate favorite is definitely the BLT though. Seasonal sandwiches and salads are always fun too. There's a kale salad around fall time that I love, can't remember the name. Anyway, keep up the great work! And build one closer to 32nd St & Shea for me ;)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Really tasty food. Awesome bread!  The Irish Soda Bread is surprisingly authentic."}
{"text":"Stopped in while traveling and their breakfast was a breath of fresh air. Super sad they don't have a location in my area. Reminded me of Panera but their menu was a lot more appealing to me. 
Ultimate bacon and egg sandwich is a must. Very satisfying, awesome flavor, and just enough vegetables to bring a bit of life back to me during a roadtrip.
Would probably give it five stars if I were able to visit more often to get a more well rounded perspective.
Reasonable price for the meal I got and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Had such a great salad here! Easy quick spot for lunch. Good portion sizes. Clean spot to sit and eat mid day."}
{"text":"stopped by for brunch with a girlfriend. my stuffed french toast was awesome, as usual. her 2 egg breakfast looked pretty good, although the portions seemed small. she said it was great. i stole some of the potatoes off her plate and they were tasty and well seasoned.

why 3 stars you ask? it isn't because of the food, although i will admit i prefer to eat breakfast over lunch or dinner here. this restaurant is awkwardly laid out with tables on top of tables. people can barely scooch by to get to their table. i've waited over 45 minutes to receive my food. i've wiped down my own table because i couldn't find anyone to do it for me. granted, long waits and dirty tables happen when the restaurant is quite busy, but it isn't an excuse. staff the restaurant to handle the volume - it is predictable. i think with better management, a redesign of the table situation and better forecasting this location could be excellent."}
{"text":"Their breads are the best. I really like the BLT Plus as well as their seasonal sandwiches."}
{"text":"Standing in line no one working the counter. Lunchtime why wouldn't there be an employee working the the counter for in house orders and one for the to go orders?  Just asking while the in house order line is at a stand still. ?"}
{"text":"More like a 4.5! Excellent food and service. I love how all the Wildflower locations are pretty much consistent in their food quality. 

This location has a lovely patio with plenty of outdoor seating, which is perfect for basking in the glorious AZ sunshine while grabbing lunch. 

My go-to meal is the BLT Plus paired with the Wildflower salad. Always fresh and delicious. The BLT is dressed up with avocado and cheddar, which really brings out the flavor and crispness of the bacon. It's all sandwiched between two thick, hearty slices of bread. Highly recommend. 

My favorite dessert here is the lemon and coconut cake - light, spongy cake with a perfect balance of tart and sweet! They also offer seasonal bakery and menu items. I haven't tried all of them but I have yet to have a disappointing meal at Wildflower. 

Prices here are on par with competitors like Panera but with better quality and portions of food, and not nearly as generic. A half sandwich and half salad cost me $10.50, plus 2 for tip. 

A server brings your food to your table after you order and will also take your plate, but for the sake of politeness I usually drop my plate off especially during busier hours. Service is quick (waited less than 10 min for my lunch) and friendly! 

The interior is clean with a nice casual ambience and easy listening playing on speakers. The cleanliness goes for the ladies' restroom as well!

My only suggestions for improvement would be to offer more bakery items, because I'm such a fan. Every time I come here there's only a handful of cakes and pastries to choose from, and half the time they don't have the item I want. That and their coffee could be stronger, but maybe I was just extra tired! 

Bottom line - this place will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"Wildflower as a whole is a fantastic chain. I've never had a bad experience with anything the chain itself has control over. 

However, there are some things that, while not completely in Wildflowers control, only seem to have happened in this specific location. It's in the middle of a set of stores all nicely lined up... in a corner with a small parking lot for that specific section. This means that the parking lot is not so fun to navigate.

I feel bad stating this as it is completely out of Wildflowers hands but is still relevant to whether you should pick this location or not. If you get there early or at specific times of the day, it's quite nice and not a problem - unless it gets packed while you're inside, then it's a pain to get out. However, if it's a busy time, then be ready to not only have a hard time finding seats inside, but in finding parking as well.

The inside gets packed as well, but even when it's slower and only has a medium amount of customers, it still has limited seating. This means that sometimes you are there with your family and need a larger area for them, but you can only quietly groan as you see anywhere that would be comfortable is taken and that quite a few of the bigger places to sit are occupied by just one person playing on their cell phone, laptop, or reading the paper. 

As I've not worked for Wildflower nor known anyone who has, I don't know what the regulations are for instances like that, especially in today's age where common courtesy is rare and people are far quicker to give bad reviews for being asked to move than good ones for great food/service, but it's pretty annoying that this happens. Just to emphasize the fact, this happens a lot at this specific location. 

Basically, Wildflower is a fantastic restaurant. Their bread is delicious, their soups are wonderful, and I really enjoy some of their salads. The restaurant itself is great. However, there ARE better placed locations that have better parking for your car and have better seating inside (so better parking for your rear too). I wouldn't say don't come here as the service is pretty decent (not outstanding but not bad), however if you can go to another location without it being inconvenient then I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Wildflower Bread Company! I've liked just about everything I've had here. However, I was SUPER disappointed when I came here this evening and discovered they no longer have their Tuscan Kale Salad . This has been a staple for me and my son for the last 3 years when we come here. I had the chopped salad instead tonight which was good but, not what I really wanted. I hope you guys get enough requests for this salad that you consider bringing it back."}
{"text":"Wildflower bread company is such a wonderful restaurant. I pop in for a quick meal fairly often as I live across the street. The ingredients are always fresh, healthy, and delicious! You order at the counter and then sit wherever you like and they bring your food out to you. The staff is always extremely polite and eager to help, which is great  to see. The restaurant is decorated with beautiful blown glass artwork by Newt Grover. The style is casual but still very nice. There is a great patio and plenty of seating indoors as well. There are fresh made breads and pastries daily that are yummy! I like to take the children I nanny here when we are headed to the train park as an alternative to the food there, as it is very conviniently located across the street. They enjoy sharing the meatballs and grilled cheese, as well as the fruit bowl. My favorite dish- the Sausage & Egg Sandwich, which has scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll... It's only 4.89, which is about what you might spend at a fast food restaurant on breakfast so why not stop by here and get something delicious instead?! It's always big enough for me to take half of it home too, which is wonderful to look forward to later. ;)"}
{"text":"Woke up today with an upset stomach and needed something light for breakfast. Maria,Aileen, Gunieta were amazing at helping me pick  something out. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and dealing with morning sickness againnd, and not eating is not a way to start my mornings. Thank you. Ladies for helping me today."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations for food from airports, but I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and boy am I surprised! The walnut cream sauce with nutmeg is extremely tasty and just glazed your tongue. The raviolis have firm pasta covering and the butternut squash is nice and sweet. Combined the two with the thick garlic bread and you have a very satisfying dish!

P.S. This is a dish that you must eat while it's hot, once the sauce cools down it will not taste the same, so don't take it to go unless you are going to eat it right away."}
{"text":"When I visit my family in Arizona, they have a tendency to pick chain restaurants. I hate chains, and I especially hate eating unhealthily. I asked my sister if there was a place they liked that was a bit healthier. I was happy when she showed me the menu for Wildflower Bread.

I had the Superfood salad with chopped salmon. It was huge, delicious, and a great value at $11.29. In fact, I paid for the four of us and with tax, the total for food and drink was only $46.95. Seemed like a pretty good deal for a semi-independent restaurant that isn't going to make you fat.

I almost went back the next day, but I couldn't resist the lure of BBQ. But I'd definitely come back and will recommend it over Chili's on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has delicious options for breakfast! A group of girlfriends went together and tried: steel cut oats, French toast, and the breakfast sandwiches. All were amazing!! The steel cut oats reviewer said \"every bite was orgasmic\". The lemony syrup was delicious on the French toast and really balanced out the whole grain toast. Berries were perfectly ripe and so juicy."}
{"text":"Last night, I ate the best sandwich I've ever had. True story.

Wildflower's seasonal sandwich, the Turkey Cranberry Walnut Stuffing, is so good, it's almost unreal.

If you're a fan of Thanksgiving dinner complete with tender, moist turkey, homemade stuffing and cranberries, you will thoroughly enjoy this sandwich just as I did.

I can't wait to try all of their other sandwiches (after I order the Turkey Cranberry 10+ more times).

I can't wait until I get to come back!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!!!  The food is so tasty!  I love soup in the winter and salad in the summer so I can come here year round.... My favorite soup is the potato cream cheese and the broccoli cheese and you just can't go wrong with the Mediterranean Salad.  Among my favorites of soups and salad I also have to say that I have all wonderful experiences with all the different foods I've tried there.  The BLT with Avocado and Cheese, The Ham Sandwich and the Raviolis!!!  Okay I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"I ordered the half soup and sandwich, choosing roasted red pepper and smoked Gouda soup, as well as a turkey tomato and Brie sandwich. The soup is amazing, I would like it to be thicker. The sandwich accompanied with a very strong mustard was a little too overpowering. It would be better if the sandwiches were made as they were ordered rather than pre made because the condiments do tend to make the bread soggy. Otherwise for a location serving at an airport not too bad. And very affordable."}
{"text":"I actually never was able to try the food here. I got so pissed at the girl taking my order that I left. What happened? Well listen to this...I decided on a sandwich..I am not sure of the name , but it had roast beef and some sort of yummy cheese and the other sandwich stuff they add to it. Well I am not a fan of veggies, i know, that's so childish, but it is what it is. Anyway, I tell the girl what I want and I let her know I want the roast beef sandwich with only cheese and mayo, no veggies. She then looks very puzzled...\" you just want cheese and mayo on bread\"? I said no....I want the roast beef with just cheese and mayo. She then says that it does not make any sense....\"so you don't want the meat\"? I then ask her...why would I order \"roast beef\" and then not want the meat? She is like well I dont know you are the one that ordered it that way. Im like are you serious right now???? She then says ...well if you are not gonna order can you step aside so I can take the next order. What ????!!!!! I ask to speak to the manager...who apparently is the girl that has been standing next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all. 

I was so outta there...I am sure the food is yummy..but it is such a shame to not only have an employee that responds this way...but to have a person in charge thinking it was normal."}
{"text":"The heart of Wildflower is its bakery, and it seems like the restaurant sprung from that. Their menu is wide-reaching, with anything from scones to fritattas, roast beef sandwiches to smoked salmon alfredo. 

I have been partial to the pasta, but have heard solid reviews of the breakfasts and sanwiches, as well. It is essentially comfort food at its most basic level, and they don't do much to rock the boat beyond that. 

It is at the same time my critique and my endorsement of Wildflower that they stay so true to comfort food recipes. Part of me would like to see something a little more adventurous and innovative, but further consideration makes me concede that my favorite aspect here is that you know what to expect when you order. The food is fresh and fast and the service is good, without much deviation from their traditional ingredients."}
{"text":"My mom and I always choose this restaurant as our go to for girls night! Every time we enter it is very busy, but the customer service is always great! We both get the Caesar salad and potato soup combo which never fails."}
{"text":"We have visited this particular location a few times in the last month and every time I leave in a pleasant mood.  The food is unique - I really loved the last two dishes I tried: Wildflower Salad and the Salmon Breakfast bowl. The salad was refreshing and it had lavender, which was surprisingly delicious and the Salmon Breakfast Bowl has so much flavor! Maybe it was just a fluke, but the last two times I visited, my bread looked incredibly delicious but only the inside of the bread was edible since the outside was very hard. I will continue to come back time and time again because I really love the fresh food options. One day I will break down and try the desserts too...I'm just holding back because I know I will probably be hooked!"}
{"text":"Love that they have full hot breakfasts, not just reheated breakfast sandwiches.  Best part is the thick buttered fresh toast.  I placed my order at the register, and a few minutes later, my eggs/potatoes/toast was delivered to my table, hot and delicious.  Large portion as well, so good value.  The staff walks around cleaning and asking if everything is ok.  The rest of their menu looked great- i got to try the chopped salad that was wonderful with very fresh ingredients...wish I had a chance to try more before I left Arizona. This location was spacious and has outdoor seating.  Sooooo much better than Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Look at the size of those!

I don't know much about the other stuff here, but the breakfast pastries are

To

Die

For

Picked up a bear claw, raspberry tart thingy, sticky bun with pistachios on top, cinnamon roll and a cheese danish.  Everything was super yummy and moist.  I think all five things were under $3 each, but I didn't pay.  At other places in Scottsdale (e.g. Scratch) you couldn't buy anything for 3 bills.

Oh, and they all happen to be GINORMOUS!  I'm talking a bear claw that was probably about 6 inches long and I could barely palm the sticky bun!  For better or worse, size matters at this place."}
{"text":"UPDATE
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I tried the breakfast, they have some seasonal \"Spring\" items on the menu. 
One of them being the Blueberry Brown Sugar Pancakes, Wildflower signature pancakes, blueberries and brown sugar served with orange sour cream, hot maple syrup and sweet creamy butter. (see pics)
 OMG!! Let me just say these were inexplicably Delicious, you have no idea what that Orange sour cream  did for those pancakes! A Match made in heaven!! YOU MUST TRY!

I Also ordered the 
Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata: eggs, ham, brie, sauted apples, sage and leeks, served with Wildflower Home Fries and buttered toast (see pics)

This was also pretty good, the toast and potatoes were just OK but I really liked the eggs.

Adding to my list of Good Breakfasts.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This place has pretty good sandwiches/salads/soups. I haven't tried their breakfast menu or their pasta.
It's good for a quick lunch or to grab some to go.

I Love their BLT Plus, it comes with bacon, romaine, tomato, cheddar, avocado and herb mayo on toasted Sourdough, although the sourdough can be a bit tough to chew so I always ask for mine on the Focaccia...mmmmmmm......much better I can chew it and it doesn't cut up your mouth.

Down side: It's in the mall, although not in the food court, its at its own entrance by Dillard's. 
It tends to be quite loud and obnoxious when busy.You stand in line to order and then they bring out your food,  if their is no tables available I wont even get in the line."}
{"text":"Great wholesome food! I had the best BLT with avocado! They use quality ingredients and their food proves it! Wish we had one in Washington, but I guess I'll just have to come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Quite a charming place to dine! Think of paradise bakery...but way better! Excellent house coffee. I look forward to visiting again :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this place frequently, be it salads, sandwiches or pastas - we have never been disappointed. Pick up and table service are both quick and samplers available if we want to buy new bread or coffee cake  
Desserts are amazing as well."}
{"text":"On a recent Friday at lunch time we were disappointed to see the order line snaking around the front of the restaurant. We love Wildflower, so we grabbed a table anyway on the charming patio with an also charming two way fireplace. I went to the back of the line to order and was expecting a bit of a wait, but the line moved right along. Three cashiers were taking orders and that explained the efficiency. I set our order flag on our table and went back to get our drinks and coffee and by the time I made it back to our patio table our food was arriving just ahead of me. Wow that was a pleasant surprise! Our lunch was as delicious as it always is and I was reminded why Wildflower is one of my very favorite restaurants! Can't wait for \"our\"new location to open on 7th St in north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! I couldn't believe how good this place was (and that's not just compared to airport food). Everything tasted so fresh and their customer service is above and beyond. The employees comped me when my order got lost. Unheard of to have cheerful and kind airport employees. I so wish Wild Flower was near me in California. I'll be excited the next time I have a layover in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Barry is awesome! Not only is the food at Wildflower fresh and good, the people that work there are nice and helpful. People like Barry and Jenna! Wholesome atmosphere, great food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Laura is terrific, very friendly and helpful.  She was at the Wildflower in Concourse A near an AA gate."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS sandwiches and soups. I had the Wildflower grilled cheese with tomato soup and my husband had the club . Both were quite tasty. I have always felt that the sandwiches and soups here/Panera are a bit overpriced but if you do the 1/2 and 1/2 you feel like you are getting a deal, ha. We had a gift card so our meal was only 15 dollars but the original 30 for two people just seemed a bit extreme however, you get what you pay for. Staff could be a bit more chirpy but they are dealing with a bunch of 80 year olds that have a million questions and can hardly hear sooo I can empathize. 

5 stars for sandwich joint.
4 stars for staff."}
{"text":"I and my husband went for breakfast on weekend. We ordered banana walnut pancakes it was delicious, fresh and not expensive. Service is excellent .This place is busy and famous for breakfast. I highly recommend trying pancakes."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here.
I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich. I know..... sound very health nutty. Trust me this is great. It is turkey breast roasted like pastrami, not turkey pieces pressed together trying to fake like it's pastrami. It is served with coleslaw and honey mustard on grilled marble eye. Messy and delicious! Come with choice of side. I like the chips which are a mix of potato and yams. I also like the potato salad which is made their using real mayo, no miracle whip and not from a carton. 
My husband ordered the turkey waldorf salad, which look great, and he said was very good. 
Their potato cream cheese soup is excellent. 
Taylor ham breakfast sandwich is great. I order a side of honey mustard with it. Their honey mustard is very good! 
Cranberry scones, pumpkin chocolate chip muffins, lemon bars, are all great. 
I also love their red white and blue bread. It make the best toast."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years.  I've always had excellent meals, pastries, and coffee.  I love the menu, appreciate the variety and healthy options, great sandwiches, pasta and big salads.  The restaurant is spotless with lovely decor, a cool fireplace on the patio where you can also eat, and plenty of comfortable seating.  The managers and staff are friendly and efficient.  Frank and Cindy know the customers often by name.  This is a real gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone would ever write a poor review for Wildflower. The food here is wonderful. The restaurant is super cute. The employees are pleasant. The restrooms are always clean. Just, everything is perfect! 

My absolute FAVORITE item is their Wildflower Almond Tuna. So insanely delicious, here's what it entails: albacore tuna, smokehouse almonds, apple, celery, green onions and mayo with dill pickle, romaine, tomato, clover sprouts and grain mustard on Nine Grain bread. 
Their Pumpkin Soup is something to write home about. I could eat it everyday of my life.
The Potato Cream Cheese Soups is insane.
Get the Fudge Brownie for dessert, you won't regret it.
Their Bagels? Awesome. Their breads? Awesome. Chocolate Chip Scone? Mmm, yes.

* Okay, calm down Ryelle. *

In conclusion, eat at Wildflower."}
{"text":"Tuna sandwich - healthy
Turkey and brie sandwich - healthy 
Bottle water - as expected
Service - ok"}
{"text":"we come here about once a week. the soup in a bread bowl is yummy- i usually get a wildflower salad with the pesto vinegarette, which is amazing! their grain mustard is also amazing and the service is usually very good. the clientele can be interesting so it is a good place to people watch :)"}
{"text":"My experiences at wildflower bread co. Have been nothing but extraordinary. The food is is great, staff is amazing, and customer service is by far the best I've experienced at a café. I would recommend
This place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the food not the service. Expect long waits and less than adequate response times on the phone. When you show up, it's confusing which line to stand in if you ordered to go. What's even more confusing is watching the employees running around. It looks like they play lots of different roles, so you might be waiting in line while someone is working the register, and then they just up and leave to go into the restaurant. 

Seems like it's run inefficiently. 

Food is great though!"}
{"text":"The woman at the cash register was so friendly to the person in front of me. When it came time for my order, I asked for a medium coffee. She cheerfully replied, \"Easy enough!\". When she returned with it she added, \"My treat. Happy Saturday!\"

So awesome. She deserves a raise."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Their menu is eclectic and healthy for the most part.  Everything seems very fresh and has always been good.

I really like the Turkey Rueben, I can't find a way to order anything else.  I hope this place proliferates to somewhere closer to my house.

It is a little crazy on the weekends, but why complain that a good place is busy?  That means it will stay open!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and delicious. The tea and bread are tasty. Their bread and soup bowls are crazy good. We go too often! Yum."}
{"text":"My go to place for a BLT Plus and to make things even better, I just found out you can order it with double bacon! Their dessert recommendations have never let me down and the bread heads (employees) always make me feel comfortable and welcomed! I can go to many other Wildflower locations but I'll always choose this one, hands down!! Thank you for never judging me on my carb intake!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to wildflower! The food was great,  the store was very clean! Service was a little on the slow side, but one employee  was working especially hard. He seemed to be jumping in everywhere to get things done, and was so polite and helpful, so much that i felt the need to compliment his work ethic. I dont know if employers keep up with this page, but his name was Gavin Logan,  and the guy deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"I was out of the country for 6 weeks and stumbled upon Wildflower in my state of hunger.  I knew them because they are nextdoor to Changing Hands Bookstore in Mesa, AZ.  Lauren Hufford waited on me;  she was delightfully enthused about all the food offered, and willing to help me in any way possible.  Her service was beyond expected.  Then when I looked for the tip jar, it was ALL for the USO!  All of the employees at that location give their tips to the USO!  This is one that should be reported on the news, as an example of our heartful Americans!  The entire staff is so united;  you can just feel the positive, enjoyment of being there.  The next time I pass through I will make it a point to stop at Wildflower, say hello,and have a great meal!  They are the Food Angels of the airport.  Bless them!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! I tried the mushroom soup.....soooo fabulous! The chop salad is my new fav.  The staff is so friendly and genuine!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the food was just OK. It was very busy during lunch and was hard to get a table. We attempted to get two tables but other rude people jumped in front to claim it.  I'll pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here whether you want to stay healthy or indulge your inner pig."}
{"text":"Everything is great. I had Reuben sammich, and my friends had salad. They are all so pretty and tasty! I wish there's one in West LA. I would be going there for lunch everyday."}
{"text":"The menu is amazing! I never know what to get but you can never go wrong"}
{"text":"The salmon bowl was fantastic!  All bread, sandwiches and staff are fantastic, as well!"}
{"text":"Great selection an food!  Unassuming storefront in small strip mall. Kinda cafeteria-style in presentation but great meatball sandwich and great bread. ANYPLACE that has 6 different soups on the menu including roasted red pepper-tomato AND mushroom (the BEST) gets my vote. 3other diners also raved."}
{"text":"I went on an investigation with a coworker, and Wildflower ended up being right near it, and it was AHMAAAAAZING. We were trying to be healthy, so though the giant chocolate chip scones were calling our names, we just got salads. I ordered the Asian chicken salad, and she ordered the chopped salad. Both were beautifully presented, and DELICIOUS. The sauce-to-salad ratio was perfect in the Asian chicken salad, and it was simple, light, and fresh. The pesto dressing on her salad was diviiiine; she found it a little salty for a salad dressing, but it was particularly phenomenal as a dip for the bread. 

I can't wait to try their soups and salads in the future! The icing on the cake was that this location was connected to a Changing Hands bookstore (which I love), so we got to browse a bit afterwards too!"}
{"text":"Very very good. Their breads are just dynamite!! My sandwich was awesome, and hubby liked his as well. We'll definitely be returning and we want to try their breakfast too. 

We sampled their jalapeño cheddar bread and ooooooomg it is so GOOD!!! We'll be back definitely"}
{"text":"The meatball sandwich was cold and made me very ill. Pretty terrible :( not coming back ever"}
{"text":"Close to my work and super busy during the lunch hours. The place is pretty big and they have multiple registers so the lines were moving fast. 

I was a little overwhelmed with the menu at first. Forgot to ask for any lunch specials. Ordered the asian salad and the portions were huge. I couldn't finish my salad and took half back to work. 

The salad was pretty good but there were way too many croutons on it. Had to fish most of it out and the ones that stayed on got super soggy. On the other hand left over salad never tasted good. So my own fault.

Will probably be back hopefully during a more quiet time. Would love to hear what they would recommend. Maybe a hot sandwich will be better idea next."}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend and I were in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the service we received before even entering the restaurant. A very kind doorman named Gavin greeted us and held the door open, while informing us about the longer wait time (granted it was very busy due to Mother's Day). My boyfriend and I sat outside near the front door and noticed how kind and accommodating Gavin was while welcoming each person in, and handing out the gift (loaf of bread) for Mother's Day to all Mother's. Gavin not only did his job very well, but he made people very happy from what we could tell! This is the service we enjoy seeing, it made lunch even more enjoyable since we were welcomed with such kindness. Way to go Gavin!"}
{"text":"I used to be obsessed with this place, and I still kind of am, but my last few visits were subpar. The atmosphere is always lively and it is usually busy when I go, which is fine for the delicious food I usually get. However, the last few visits I have wanted nothing more than a bread bowl with some basic soup (chicken noodle, tomato, cheddar and broccoli, etc) but out of the four soups of the day, nothing sounded remotely good to me. The last time I went I ordered the roasted sweet potato sandwich, which I thought was pretty gross, and since nobody comes to check on you, I had noone to complain to, so instead I ordered another meal, can't remember which, but I liked it. I really do love this place and will probably not stop coming back - their bread is especially delicious. And the cupcakes? The best around - better than specialized cupcake places. I also love that it is connected to Changing Hands Bookstore. It was just a couple of less than great visits that make me knock this place down a star."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh.Service with a smile.Samantha is always nice when we go on a greets us with a smile.This is my fave.Wildflower I go here 2-3 Times a month and have never been disappointed with The food or service"}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly behind the counter and loved to explain each thing on the menu.  Seriously, though, in all honesty - I REALLY needed coffee this morning.  \"So\", I asked, \"is it possible to get a few shots of espresso, on ice, black, unsweetend?\"  - I got a vibrant... You GOT IT!!! She offered up on of the luscious, buttery happy treats in the case - screaming my name and wanting to get on the next flight with me... but i politely refused and a gal gave me a huge smile rang me up - we will get that for you right away!!!

Seriously? totally makes your day when people are nice. I bet the people who work here are only hired because they are positive and energetic - They are awesome.. not some downers. Kinda glad I didnt walk a mile to that other coffee place.

The coffee was great, too. I would love to have tasted this coffee cold brewed (didnt see it on the menu), just to really know what it taste like!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.

I had frittata vegetables it's come with two giant breads and potatoes, it was good but not wow."}
{"text":"I'm a fan... we eat here often.  The menu has a lot to offer and their food is very good.  Love the soups... love the sandwiches ... LOVE the butternut squash ravioli.  The sauce is killer!!!    The have great cookies and pastries as well.  The staff are always nice and the place is always clean.  Well worth trying if you haven't been there.

{"text":"This is definitely comparable to Paradise Bakery or Panera Bread, except that it's not a national chain (just Phoenix), which is always nice to patronize.
But it's also a bit better. I go to Panera Breads in various parts of the country to use their free wifi (which is also available here at Wildflower), but rarely actually eat there because it's just not that good. Paradise is just gross most of the time, and I'll only eat there if I have a coupon.
Where Wildflower separates itself from these places is the quality of the food: it's pretty good. The mass of sweets conveniently laid out at the entrance leads you to believe this right away. There are some great-looking cakes and breads, and they have some wonderful looking cinnamon rolls.
But you're probably going for the breakfast. The nice thing about this place, tucked back into a newer strip mall on Indian School west of 44th, is that it shares its parking lot with a primarily dinner restaurant and a Cold Stone, both of which are not likely to be crowded at breakfast time. And this leaves plenty of parking in an otherwise relatively small lot.
The place is busy and full of kids. There are booths on the walls, big tables in the middle, a small sidewalk patio outside and a big, round table in the middle of it all, strewn with newspapers and magazines. It's comfortable, although a bit frantic and noisy.
I had the sausage and egg sandwich and a side of home fries, although you shouldn't believe for a second that it was simply a sausage and egg sandwich. It was more of a sausage omelet sandwich, as, mixed in with the eggs were cheese, green onions and red peppers, all on a ciabatta roll. It was nice for what it was, but I will say that I was disappointed by the sausage, which was definitely frozen and a little lifeless.
The home fries were good, but overpriced: the tiny plate cost me $2. But I got approximately 1/2 red potato lightly fried (not greasy in the least) loaded with rosemary and possibly a little garlic. Very good.
My companion had the ham and egg sandwich which, unfortunately, was exactly that: ham and eggs. To be fair, the ham was very good and had an excellent flavor, but it was just dull compared to my sandwich.
And especially compared to some of the other options. Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata? Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata? Yum! Then there were also interesting sounding pancakes and a french toast option. Very nice!
Not much of a service place. You order up front and your food is brought to you. You're then left alone. I asked for ketchup and tabasco for my home fries, and was told that I couldn't get my own but that it would be brought to me. It never came, but that was fine, because I ended not needing them.
I also take issue with the fact that they call theirs a \"homestyle\" breakfast. I'm not sure from which home they came, but, at my house, we did not cook breakfasts which involved brie, roasted tomato or lemon ricotta. Maybe I was disadvantaged, but I think of \"homestyle\" as simple eggs, bacon, toast and maybe some sort of potato or biscuit dish.
It's not a bad thing to not be served a mound of greasy, homestyle goodness on a morning when I would rather eat otherwise, but I feel that it's misleading to refer to this as such.
Also, for Tucsonans, this is completely unrelated to the \"Wildflower\" there, but that becomes very obvious as soon as you see this place."}
{"text":"The system in which you order needs to be improved greatly.  So does the courtesy of the employees.  Customer service is just as important as the palatableness and quality of the food.  
The coffee is never pleasant it seems like an afterthought left in a pot.  The entrées are reasonable for taste for the health conscious but seems more than slightly over priced.  The bread and pastries are delicious. I frequented this place often in the past but there are so many more interesting options with better quality for the price point. 
Wildflower must go back to its roots to make me a loyal customer again.  Too many short cuts and compromises from the place it used to be.  The staff seems minimally trained and unfamiliar with the ingredients in many basic staples.  While I understand this may be a first time job for many, unknown ingredients could spur life threatening allergies.
If I were evaluating Wildflower Bread Company solely on the bakery it would be 4.5 stars.  But that is too generous for the restaurant/café as a whole, IMHO, especially when there are so many other options from non-chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Mass chain-like feel but worked out for my needs and some so new explorers shouldn't turn away based on strip mall hell you've got to go through to find it as the quality in food is here.  I'm just not used to endless miles of strip malls so for me this is like a needle in a haystack and the volume of people that frequent this establishment is overwhelming - like they're giving it away...

Outdoor seating is an option I guess, on a parking lot so weird but again, likely subculture and just not what I'm used to as everyone was more than pleased eating salads, sandwiches and baked goods of every variety."}
{"text":"I had my nursing school study group here today. Our food came out quickly. Food was good. However, we waited for a little over an hour for our empty bowls and plates to be bussed. We finally moved the plates to an empty table and someone, frowning, showed up to pick up the plates. They were not busy."}
{"text":"This is my updated review. The staff today bused tables FAST. Everyone was attentive. The ladies room was clean! I had my favorite muffin, the pumpkin chocolate chip, it is always outstanding. My son had the chicken parmigiana sandwich. He would give the sandwich itself 4 stars. He felt it was a little too salty and needed more chicken. My little son had a chocolate chip cookie and loved it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Wildflower Bread Company for awhile now, but since there's not one near my house, it's just never happened. But, I'm impressed - it's delicious! 

You walk up to the counter and place your order... sandwiches, soups, and pastries. I had a half sandwich and soup and it was great. The cheddar broccoli soup and big chunks of broccoli in it... a welcome change from many other chains' soups. 

The employees were exceptionally cheerful and quick to get customers' orders together. My only complaint is there there isn't one closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the half sandwich and soup combo. Turkey Brie and vegetable soup!"}
{"text":"I go to the Wildflower in Gilbert quite often and enjoy the food.  I stopped in here during a shopping trip at Chandler Mall and I won't be going back.  The salad was smaller than I'm used to.  They didn't give my son a cookie with his kid's meal.  The guy taking our order was acting erratic as if he was on drugs or something.  There was another employee walking around who looked like he hadn't showered in a week and his pants were sagging and his underwear was hanging out.  Even the customers were rude!  Very bad experience"}
{"text":"What a great surprise.  We were on way to Denny's for breakfast and saw this place.  Outdoor seating and setup like Panera.   Had the egg and bacon sandwich on amazing bread - it was very good and a big size serving.  Wife had frittata that was also huge and she loved it.   Definitely a great place to try and even better to make a frequent trip to if you live in area (unfortunately we're only visiting)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves this place. Which means I eat here much more often than I like to. That isn't to say it isn't good.  I've found a few items that I really enjoy such as the penne pasta with basil pesto and the bread bowls with nearly any of their soups. All of their sandwiches that I've had were just ok, but nothing I disliked. I just tried their breakfast for the first time last week and it was outstanding. Unfortunately they only offer it in the morning. (A little later on the weekend) Be careful about coming on peak times as the dining room fills up pretty frequently and it can be difficult to find a table. It's a great place to carry out from though, as there is a bookstore next door that is fun to peruse as you wait for your meal.  Oh and make sure you try their Toffee Tort. It is incredible."}
{"text":"I went to Wildflower looking for a lunch spot that had wifi. I arrived at 11:30, and noticed every table in the small place was full. It was my first time there, it seemed a lot like Paradise Bakery (which is a good thing), so I ordered, hoping a table would open up. Price was about the same as Paradise. By the time my food got there, no tables opened, so I got the food to go. I got home, opened the food, and much to my dismay, it was quite a bit worse than Paradise. Also, no delicious cookie. Next time I'll just drive up the street a couple miles."}
{"text":"Why go to Wildflower when Panera Bread and Corner Bakery are available?  The simple answer?  There's actually selections for fat gluttonous men that must eat stereotypical manly foods that are heavy in fat, high in protein, and larger portion sizes.  Ordered the chicken parmesan and a chocolate chip scone, and neither disappointed.   Both were delicious and satisfied both my carb and protein desire.  The best part is they don't get mad if you went to Total Wine and grabbed yourself an ice cold beer."}
{"text":"To know me is to know I love Wildflower Bread Company and  especially this location!  From breakfast to lunch to dinner to something sweet - there is something for everyone. Menu options for the healthy me to pastries and cakes for my sweet tooth.  The staff here is always warm, friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"We are not huge fans of chains, but this local chain knows how to do it right.  They use fresh ingredients and are always adding new items to the menu.  A few of our favs: 
Taylor Ham and Egg Sandwich
Turkey Waldorf Salad
Beef & Cheddar Sandwich (new item)
Passion Fruit Ice Tea
Their bread is also amazing as well as the chocolate scones

The only area that could improve is their cookies/cupcakes..

{"text":"Ok, enough is enough. I have given this location many attempts since my last review, but I'm at the end of my rope now.

The last few times I have eaten at this location I have gotten sick after eating the food. Today I ordered my usual--after I ate it I started feeling nauseated. I thought a nap would help, but my stomach hurt so bad it woke me up. This is gross, but needs to be said...I have been throwing up ever since.

I'm not sure if the staff has improved much, either. Every time I order they give me an apathetic attitude.

I appreciate everything the upper management for Arizona has done for me--thank you for being concerned and for all of your help! I am sorry this location did not work out for me because I love this company. I just won't be returning to this location. I will still attempt other locations, but I've had enough with the one on Indian School and 44th Street. It's just not worth getting food poisoning again."}
{"text":"Wildflower, how I love thee!

I have never had any problems with food or staff at this location. It is always very crowded, but staff works to find you a table and get your food to you quickly! The music is also at an acceptable and comfortable volume. Go here!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter to wildflower for lunch yesterday, she had the grilled cheese and i had the Triple club. Everything was delicious and the service was perfect! Our food came out quickly and we were greeted by the manager who is lovely. After lunch we got some cookies for the road and they were super soft and yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the menu is a little over whelming so if you are planning to stop by then be prepared to stare at the menu for awhile. The coffee, bagels, and pastries are all super delicious. The service is just so-so. I've never been greeted with a warm welcome or by an employee who seems to really enjoy their job. Also the wait times in line can get really long. There was multiple guests ahead of me and only one cashier but there were 3 people expediting food and 2 in the lobby. So it just felt like someone could have jumped over to help. Over all pretty good. I'll probably come back but I'll choose Cafe Zupas or maybe somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've tried only once, but that doesn't mean I'm always tempted when ever I'm at changing hands...The taste of their sandwiches is awesome! good bread, good service. Will have to stop by other day for lunch!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I wanted to go off of our regular route for lunch so we headed over to Wildflower Bread Company for a change of pace. So glad we did!

Their menu is pretty big - lots of salad, sandwiches and soup options. They also carry many baked goods that looked really yummy. I ordered the beef stew with fruit salad combo (I love combos!) and my friend ordered a salad. We sat down and our food was served almost immediately.

The portions are very generous. My beef stew was what you could call hearty. Big chunks of beef, potatoes and veggies. Even the broth was thick and flavorful. It tasted fresh made, not out of a can. My fruit salad was fresh as well and had lots of strawberries, grapes and pineapple. Nothing worse than fruit salad that's nothing but cantaloupe. The fruit was served on top of greens with some kind of yogurt - very tasty. The sweet and light fruit was a nice counterbalance to the heavy stew. My meal also came with bread so needless to say I did not go home hungry.

The only downside to this place is the parking. There are a lot of restaurants in this strip mall so lunchtime gets really busy. We had to park pretty far away from Wildflower and walk over. Not a big deal when it's nice out but in the summer it could get kinda hot."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant so you wouldn't expect the food to be good, but it is. 

I like the chopped salad with fresh herbs. I also like their soups, and the roasted sweet potato sandwich. You can get the Wildflower Two combo of soup, petite salad or half sandwich, perfect for lunch. Their bread is great quality, always fresh. Nothing is overly salted or greasy or bland the way you expect at a chain restaurant. It tastes like someone put serious thought and care into putting the recipes together, and is maintaining standards in every kitchen.

I really appreciate that they use antibiotic and hormone-free chicken and pork. They also have quite a few vegetarian options. 

Atmosphere is kind of generic but it is a chain. Wildflower is miles ahead of Paradise Bakery in flavor and food quality. Safe place for a good meal and the price is nice."}
{"text":"I am usually a huge fan of Wildflower, but not of this location. The coffee was old and the food was cold. When I asked to get cooked potatoes they were very sweet but still gave me cold food. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't eat salad... I love food and my idea of a great meal is not salad... let me tell you.

But...

That all changed when my sister & mother asked if I'd join them for brunch. [MIND BLOWN] I ordered the Cesar salad with chicken and the creamy potatoe soup and it changed my life forever! I lived it, I was satisfied and full. So I guess the moral of the story is, \"don't knock it till you try it.\""}
{"text":"Always busy yet quickly served, Wildflower can be counted on for healthy cuisine that leaves the other food court venues in the dust.

Example: not one but two exquisite kale salads that are just awesome for lunch or dinner.  My friend and I enjoy bread with olive oil and it is wonderful. Even better: it's free with the meal!"}
{"text":"My dinner was the Wildflower chicken salad sandwich made from all natural, care-free, antibiotic and hormone free chicken breast with tomato slice and sprouts.  Also the mushroom soup. Yummy!!!!! 
The manager Casey took great care of us last night!!! Thank you Casey!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed that they have taken the stuffed French toast off the menu.  I understand that changes need to happen, but when your favorite item is taken away there will be disappointment.  This place continues to raise prices, but not the quality of the food.  Have I mentioned disappointed!!!  The experience overall was just lackluster.  Will not be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place after all the reviews as I needed to grab lunch before my flight, and as you can see from the photo, my bread was grilled way too long so it was super hard and oily. The fillings were minimal and regretted not getting Panda Express next door."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before my flight. Was surprised by the shear pleasantness of the staff and tasty food options. For the weary traveler expecting often rushed service, this is a welcome change to the typical chain restaurant and grease infused garbage.  
Congrats to wildflower for breaking this mold."}
{"text":"Went specifically for the Roast Beef & Gorgonzola sandwich.  Still fresh in my memory, I refused to share and wanted my own, \"I want it and I want it NOW!\"

It really is a delicious & rich sandwich!  My recommendation; ask for it on a different roll/bread OR keep it on the sourdough and make your own \"dipped\" sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I pick up for postmates a lot here and I always hVe a good experience. They staff are nothing but courteous and always in a good mood. Almost always the order is finished when I get there, and if it's not it's out very soon after."}
{"text":"I've already written reviews for two other locations in Phoenix. This is my first time at this one as we were in the area and wanted to use the gift card I was sent. I had the bread bowl with potato and cream cheese soup. That's my favorite. My boyfriend got the Parmesan sandwich, that was delicious too. This was his first time and he now loves it. He did say the potato salad wasn't his favorite, but you can't win them all. Staff was great, food came out quickly, lovely location. They have a bookstore connected too so that's neat."}
{"text":"If you wanna feel good before going on an agonizing flight, you should probably come here first."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot! try the chopped salad! Great customer service and clean establishment"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast. The banana pancakes 3 of them medium size, more than enough for two, were dynamite.  Crowded but they handled it well and our food was hot and tasty. Stan the manager was gracious and encouraging. We will return again soon."}
{"text":"I could eat here breakfast, lunch and dinner and never get tired of it.  Our whole family likes it, I can have butternut squash ravioli with a sage cream sauce and the  kids are happy with their meatballs, grilled cheese sandwiches, and sour cream potato soup.   I love the blackberry Lemonade, the pistachio croissants and the salads.  
They  have the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had. (Brie and Arugula on 9 grain).  They also have a plain traditional grilled cheese for the  non- sophisticated taste in my household.  My 13 year-old daughter said was the best she ever had. My other teenager says they have the best oriental chicken salad that she has ever had.   My fall favorites are the pumpkin bread (think crusty bread with a subtle hint of pumpkin and cinnamon) and the savory roasted butternut squash salad. the hardest decision I have is what to order and have even ordered two entrees when I really can't choose.   I mostly take out, but when I can eat in, I love the wi-fi and comfy chairs."}
{"text":"Amazing soups!!! Also the pumpkin Bread is wonderful!!! I will be back soon!! Also the general manager Lauren was awesome and has excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Just got back from the best lunch EVER!
I had a braised beef sandwich, which is new on the menu. 
Braised beef and mashed potatoes on grilled ciabatta, served with horseradish cream and au jus. It was absolutely perfect and under $10."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Always seems fresh and healthy, which is maybe why it is a little pricey. Some of my favorites are butternut squash ravioli, chicken pistachio pomegranate salad, and roast beef and Gorgonzola salad. 

My husband likes the pasta with salmon. Tonight when we got it he thought it was dry. They remade the dish for him and he still thought the salmon was dry. The manager refunded our money and gave us a complementary dessert of our choice. That is amazing customer service!!! I have to say their customer service is always good, but this was above and beyond."}
{"text":"Ok, back again...and again! I actually find myself thinking about their potato and cream soup. While the nutritional value is heavy in fat/carbs...it has now become my cheat day meal! And, the chicken cesear salad, while sounds basic, is my go-to meal while I'm on lunch break. I love that the service is quick enough that I can even swing in on my 30 minute break. Their bread is absolutely delicious...I am a huge fan of the sourdough! I'm not sure if it is actually baked fresh daily, or like other places, shipped in frozen and then placed in the oven. I would be curious to know.

Would recommend over Panera/Paradise!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a yummy healthy lunch. I took my dad here on his birthday and he absolutely loved it! My favorites is the BLT Plus and a bowl of one of their soups....soooo goood!"}
{"text":"There are three sandwiches I love here. The chicken pesto feta, the sweet potato, and the Wildflower grilled cheese. All part of my regular rotation. Only minor complaint about the sweet potato sammy is there is usually too much mozzarella for me, so I end up removing half of it.  On the breakfast menu, I love the stuffed french toast. It is so sinfully good and the blueberry compote is beautiful and delicious. I like that this location is attached to Changing Hands. I usually end up either starting or ending there when I go to Wildflower."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Tempe location but this one is close to my office so I have been about a dozen times. It's huge, so even during the lunch rush, there is not much waiting - always tables available and they are quick to serve you. You will probably wait longer trying to find a spot in the horrific parking lot. The things I dig most are the sandwiches. The chicken pesto feta, the sweet potato, and the grilled cheese are my repeat orders. I am not much of a fan of the baked goods here though. They are pricey and pretty average. I think even AJ's bakery is a better value."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location with two grandchildren for breakfast. We were greeted with a smile by the young person taking our order - how refreshing. The kids had a breakfast parfait, which they totally enjoyed. The adults had breakfast egg sandwiches, which we probably the best we've tasted in a long time. Fresh eggs, bacon, and cheese on a brioche bun- awesome.
The manager(?) Jesse was extremely courteous, and made the whole experience great.
I strongly recommend this place for a great meal in terminal 4."}
{"text":"I love this place. I do not live in Phoenix/ Tempe but every time I head out of town I make sure to stop in for lunch or a pasta and definitely like 10 scones. I wish these guys would open in Tucson! In fact if you read this I beg you to do so. Great place, great prices, fresh and extremely good all around! A must"}
{"text":"I cant get enough of the Chicken Pesto with Feta sandwich here.  This place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price.

My only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on EVERYTHING, but, if you are a mushroom fan, live it up. 

On another not, if you like fresh lemonade, you must get a glass of it here.  It goes great with any sandwich.

If you are in a Pasta mood, The chicken pesto pasta is excellent."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The staff went above and beyond to be helpful on a busy morning. Unfortunately, since this is an airport location, it doesn't have all the breads, baked goods, and specials a full storefront would have. It's still one of your best bets for PHX airport food."}
{"text":"I will give them 4 stars for the taste and freshness but they are lacking in some areas when you compare them to panera or kneaders. 

I had egg breakfast. Nice that they serve breakfast until 2pm on weekends. Sometimes I want breakfast for lunch. 

The potatoes were actually seasoned. I can't stand when people say they have seasoned home fries with no flavor other than grease. A fryer does not equal seasoning. The toast was really good. Good quality bread. The eggs were perfectly cooked not overdone or under done. 

I also had a side of ham. It was a little salty in a good way. 

I ordered a cinnamon role. While it was huge it was not very good. I ate 1/4 of it and stopped. The outside ring was completly dry. The inside was not much better and the icing was way to sweet for a cream cheese icing. This leads me to think I would rather have kneaders for pastries. 

The other area they lack is cleanliness. The drink station was a mess. I saw a few dirty tables. To be fair they did just have a small rush and I was the tail end of that. I did see them hit the floor and clean and restock while I dined. 

I will give them a 2nd try maybe at dinner and see what their pasta is like. 

I will say I also saw managers actually working on the floor. To often you see managers just pointing at workers and giving commands. Kudos to what appears as active managers."}
{"text":"I like coming here when I want to pretend to read and then do some grocery shopping.  I say pretend to read becase, invariably, I start eaves dropping on people seated near me.  Usually these people are either a) real estate professionals on a lunch meeting or b) families with small children who are saying ridiculous things.  I've also run in to a guy my friend used to date while he is on a date... that was pretty strange.  I like their salads, the breakfast sandwhich with feta, and the portobello sanwhich (on ciabatta, not the recommended bread).  I am in love with the sweet potato sandwhich, but it is huge.  I recommend ordering a half or sharing it... even then it is a lot of sandwhich.  A scone will fill you up for the entire morning and afternoon. 

My mom requests a trip to \"the place next to the cool bookstore\"  whenever she comes to town.  (p.s.  the cool bookstore is Changing Hands... and I agree with my mom -- it is very cool.)"}
{"text":"I use to love to come to this place but now that I have to eat only Gluten Free the only option was soup. The gal at the cash register didn't really know what she was doing. I kept asking different questions she wouldn't ask for me about anything she Just kept saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So I'm not really sure I'll be back. So sad"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and originally I was shocked at how many vegan friendly options this company has. I've come here for months and stopped because I often have little faith that there will be food that's vegan friendly. The staff was more than willing to accommodate me and was very open to talking with me and made me feel important. I'm very glad this is less than a mile from my home. Anthony from the Gilbert location was great at making us feel accommodated and cared for as a customer."}
{"text":"i love sandwiches..  before, i used to visit  \"paradise bakery\".. then i got tired of their bread..  i can be very picky when it comes to food.. but i believe bread is the heart and soul for sandwiches..  man.. wild flower makes one mean bread!  

i always order \"BLT plus\" with cup of \"potato cream cheese soup\"..  mmmmmmm!!

one of my buddy never been to wild flower.. so we visited over the weekend..  looks like he is coming back soon.. =  )

great food.. great service.. but it can be pricey for sandwich for those who are used to \"Subway\"!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location, so I can't speak for any others. I absolutely love their salads. I can make mine the way I like it and it's super good. I have ordered the exact same type from Paradise Bakery and I can say that I'd rather eat Wildflower's each time if given the choice. Always comes with yummy bread that tastes so good with the dressing. They also have a lovely section of baked goods and breakfast foods. Really nice atmosphere and everyone is super nice to me. I love to call in my order and pick it up. Only time I had a problem was when someone put cheese on my salad and they not only re-made it for me, but the manager gave me a giftcard, I love this place, just wish it was cheaper! Still highly recommend. I hope to try their pasta's soon, but they are only available after a certain time so I cannot comment on that yet :)"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times but each and every time I have eaten here I've been pleasantly surprised. I went after work today because I needed to pick up a book I'd ordered from Changing Hands Bookstore next door (definitely a bonus having a bookstore connected to the place). I ordered a Reuben sandwich and it was delicious. Bread was soft and fresh and the ingredients were put together just right. Delicious and moist and made me go mmm when I bit in to it (sounds kinky - but seriously it's a great sandwich) Service was good too :) Definitely worth a visit -- be warned though this is a popular place so keep this in mind and plan for a little wait depending on time of day. I've been early on a Sunday morning for breakfast and it's a decent time..before the brunch crowd (I'm talking butt crack of dawn early :))"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place after hearing nothing but great reviews from others.  Now I can see why it is held in such high regard.  If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of \"like 3 items\"  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time.."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad at the PHX AIRPORT location to eat on the plane. The salad and dressing were so fresh AND DELICIOUS!!  I stopped by again today. I missed my connecting flight so I ordered and sat for a while. In addition the the food being delicious AND well priced the staff are actually mentally present AND pleasant!  While I sat at a table for 6 with several travelers we were asked 3 different times by 3 different staff members about \" how was the sandwich or how is your salad or pastry\". When does that happen at an airport cafe??  Impressive!!  
I highly recommend everything there!  I have had a sandwich, two different salads and a scone. Everyone at my table loved their orders as well. We all discussed how delicious the food and SHOCKING the service!!  BIG LOVES TO THE STAFF AND THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE WHO PREPARED MY FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and Iced tea.  It has become very busy between 11:30-2, which is great for them, bad for available seating.  I switched to breakfast and love the Brie & Ham Frittata and Rosemary Potatoes.  Great morning hang out to get some work done and grab a bite.  The newer staff isn't as friendly as the previous staff at all, but Manny is still very friendly and helpful and the regulars seem to really like him."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I only wish they'd open the chain up in California.

They have really good sandwiches!  Just to name a couple: the turkey/ brie and the wildflower chicken salad sandwich.

I can't exactly put my finger on it, but this place hits the spot.

The last time I tried to go before I left AZ, they were closed and renovating.  That was more than 6 months ago so it should be fine and dandy now."}
{"text":"I went here with a coworker about a week ago when we wanted a nice lunch. I got the wildflower two with the roast beef sandwich and the potato cream cheese soup. I also got their iced tea which was very tasty, and a loaf of lavain bread to go with my dinner that night.

Both were AMAZING. Nice pleasant service, clean, busy restaurant. Plenty of seating (even though we took it back to the office). Overall a pleasant experience. I'm sure I'll go back when I don't mind dropping $10-15 on lunch."}
{"text":"How on earth did I miss reviewing this place?! This place is an absolute dream! I am so in love with their Potato Cream Cheese soup and the Wild Flower grilled cheese sandwich. Word of caution though, this place is almost always packed. Sometimes seating can be a problem, if you're pressed for time, you might want to call in your order. Pastas are a must try also!"}
{"text":"Yeah finally a Wildflower near my house! I've eaten here once a week since they've opened and I have no plans of stopping. Supper friendly staff, homemade artesian bread made onsite, delicious salads, hearty soups and excellent beverages (delicious iced tea and fresh lemonade, also new natural fountain sodas.)
Breakfast, lunch, dinner and excellent desserts you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had an event catered by these people. What a great thing. On time, organized, and top-notch quality all ingredients. Could not have been happier with the experience. We also enjoy the breakfasts here. Quality food, good service, clean place. No complaints. Check my pics for the salads and meals, order what you like, it's all good."}
{"text":"Soup and salad are very delicious. I love this place to bits. I come at least once a week. Free wifi and cool vibe. The food is fresh and the coffee is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing! So full of fresh ingredients! I especially love breakfast menu, pretty much all of it! The staff is friendly and very accommodating. I eat here at least once every week and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places and now its closer to home! We always split a Sweet Potato sandwich and the Potato Soup is DELECIOUS!"}
{"text":"Food was great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The customer service on my visit was five star. The to go meatballs were great. The seasonal club sandwich was great as well. This is my father's favorite place for traditional pancakes."}
{"text":"Had the Superfood salad with chicken. Exected a little more quinoa but still very good."}
{"text":"What a fun place, happened in for lunch, now I cant wait to go back for breakfast after seeing the pancakes and breads yumm! Our lunch was great! N.Y. Deli great bread loaded with ham and swiss. Really good service, plus they had a guy playing a guitar. How cool is that! P & C"}
{"text":"Went for a massage at massage envy and wanted to end our day with a snack, we had the pick two chicken salad and potato cream cheese soup. Both were excellent but we realized a bread bowl would have made it even better so I asked if we could add after we had already started our meal and frank graciously brought us a bread bowl on the house, 5 stars for making our meal even better!"}
{"text":"We have become bored with the few vegan options here. Customer service is always great, with the exception of two of their managers in the past being kind of cranky to their staff or us.

The food is always fresh and beautifully prepared and they do a good job of putting take out orders together."}
{"text":"We're gone to this place several times, always had great service and the food is the best. Portion sizes are perfect to the point your never feeling you over ate. We love the atmosphere and the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Hungry after a flight and waiting on another flier, I waltzed in here.  Pleasant staff, nice menu and speedy service.  The tomato, pesto & Brie on toasted 9 grain bread was delish. Vegan squash medley soup hot and full of flavor.  Manager kindly carried what my hands could not AND she wiped my table down as well.  Five for flavor, freshness, fast, friendly & fab location."}
{"text":"This new Wildflower is BEAUTIFUL! It's very modern, the patio is welcoming, and everything about it is appealing to me. The food was delicious and the service was quick and friendly. I can see myself coming here incredibly often!"}
{"text":"Turkey Brie sandwich was ok.  Brie and turkey were good.  Bread got soggy quick because the peppers and tomatoes were wet.  The mustard is good.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"They were quick and friendly . They managed the line by moving people to the next available cashier.  I had my order ready for 3 people and money ready then ordered a cookie after I ordered and was given a free cookie for being ready."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 10 years.  The outside seating is gone now, but it was terribly noisy once the 101 was built.  This used to back pima rd. when there was a pima rd.  The remodel was fantastic.  More seating and a modern atmosphere reminiscent of bellagio and other new vegas sites. 
This place has the best bread and desserts! I especially like the $2 honor system bread purchase. I use this often.  I used to not go for a long time because it was such a hassle to wait on a huge line just to get a baguette to go.  This location took care of that problem, and at only $2 a baguette. That's a steal!

Ciabatta rolls are the best i have found for take out and making sandwiches at home. Real crispy out and soft in.  Best place to buy sourdough loaves too.  Everything is fresh.

try the deserts!  it took me years to try it, now it's a must have every time."}
{"text":"The feta & vegetable fritata is my favorite! I order this every time and never disappoints. I don't care for potatoes so I usually leave them but everyone seems to love them here. They have so many options of salads and soups as well. The drinks are amazing here love the lemonades and teas. Staff is always super friendly. This place is a must for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Just got off a red eye from Hawaii.  This place is a bit of a cluster F.  

It's not even all that busy and they're screaming like maniacs.  \"NEXT GUEST READY TO ORDER!!\"  Then I'm trying to place my order and between nearly every word, the woman is literally yelling in my face \"WILL THAT BE IT?!?\"  

That actually just slows things down.  Let people place their damn order.

To top it off, Blink 182 was playing very loudly while all this is happening.

That said - the coffee was not bad and my breakfast sandwich was pretty good and came put very quickly."}
{"text":"This place needs to step up the service...twice this week I had poor service.  Breakfast sales create themselves, it's up to the establishment to keep people happy with their choice.  You can find me at the small business (it's a closer drive anyway) coffee and bagel shop for the rest of the summer.  I'm not sure when I bother coming back if ever.  It's way too bad because they have some of the best bagels"}
{"text":"I was really bummed to walk in and see some of the staff from the Gilbert location had been transplanted here. I almost always received bad service when I visited that location and it was about the same at this one as well.

I ordered pasta. The noddles were overcooked, which is disappointing at how basic it is to cook noodles. Also, they didn't drain them well because my pasta had a lot of excess water in the bowl. The pasta came with vegetables but they were very sparse. The bread that came with the meal was one million times better than the pasta. Thank goodness for it or I might have walked away completely hungry.

I frequently eat at Wildflower Bread Co and have good things to say about their other locations. If I go here again I will probably order a sandwich since it seems something as trivial as boiling noodles is out of their league."}
{"text":"I came here today and there were two tables that were already served when I came and I still had to wait 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches. One of the sandwiches was on the \"HOT\" menu and for the other one I requested it to be warmed up. In fact, the  cashier asked if I wanted the sandwich microwaved or grilled; I said grilled. After the immense that I had to go through, even though I was in a rush, the sandwiches arrived ice cold. I ask them to warm it up and they wanted to remake the order again which would waste another 30 min I simply told them to reheat it because I was in a rush. But another employee said that they could either refund my money or make a new order. I got my money refunded, but was treated extraordinarily poorly... This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"We come here so often, they know our order:). We enjoy the clean quiet atmosphere and the food.  Our family often meets us here and the past weekend we also brought our neighbors.  They liked the great breakfast menu.  All enjoyed pancakes, French toast and frittatas.  The staff is always courteous and professional. This is by far our favorite restaurant for meeting with our family."}
{"text":"For a bakery (I do not eat bread) they had a couple of good options for eating healthy."}
{"text":"This is my hubby's and my favorite breakfast spot. We always get greeted with a welcoming  smile by Maria and Cassandra. They always make sure we are completely satisfied with the entire service experience. Our food is always prepared quickly and to perfection. We especially appreciate the fact that Jim, the Manager makes sure this location is spotless and  the day to day operation always runs smoothly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing . It's  the perfect convergence of a great bakery , a great breakfast place and great customer service.

Try all the great breads , fresh soups, great lunch sandwiches too.

I come here every time I'm in Phoenix and hope they come to Washington state !"}
{"text":"Ooh.  Such a great view from here.  Breakfast is wonderful here, but I'm not so sure about dinner.  But it's all worth it to be outside with the view of the sunset / sunrise!"}
{"text":"They get very busy for lunch and as a result the food suffers.  I went there yesterday and ordered the chopped salad which is very similar to a more expensive version at Cowboy Ciao.  The corn was stale, no butter for my bread, and they were so busy it would have taken forever to get some.  I like Wildflower, but only at off peak hours.

Edited to add that the founder of Wildflower read this review, reached out to me, and sent a full refund for our meal, along with a gift card.  He was open to feedback and asked for me to dine there again.  It was a very nice gesture, and I will keep on going there for lunch."}
{"text":"The pasta was extremely delicious, and the staff was amazing and friendly. I well most definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"This is the one and only chain restaurant that I truly love. This particular location stands out as well. This place is a must go!

First, the people here are ALWAYS exceptionally nice and quick to serve. I have never, ever had a bad or even so-so experience here in all of the years I've been coming. They are top notch!

Next, the food. Oh how I love it. The bread is delicious, crusty in the outside and soft and springy on the inside. My favorite sandwich here is the BLT Plus (Bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, and avocado). I usually get the choose two, which is half of a sandwich or salad and soup. They have a wide variety of soups that change with the day, but they always have the Potato soup and it is excellent. The Mediterranean salad is amazing, as are the pasta dishes. Honestly, you really can't go wrong here.  There's another popular sandwich/salad/soup place across the street but I would choose Wildflower every single time."}
{"text":"A great place to come and get a fast but quality bite. I have had four of sandwiches now and none of them have dissapointed.  The service is also top notch. May (the manager) catered to our every need it was seriously over the top excellent service! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The food is super good and staff is great! Great place to be at"}
{"text":"I am amazed at the excellent customer service of this airport cafe! They go out of their way to be kind and are very fast and efficient. Plus, they have sot milk for my latté!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Really big menu and everything I've had so far is really great! Their curry soup is basically my new addiction. Anywayss I digress... everything just tasted really fresh and everyone working was really nice. I'm defiantly a fan."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review sweet and simple. 
If you're looking for great food and phenomenal customer service. Look no further.
Keep up the great work!! 

You have a customer for life."}
{"text":"This place is always clean and had amazing food! Every time I come the food is consistent and I leave feeling great!! I get the chop salad and love it!!! I highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"I had the banana walnut pancakes. Very good and the service was very fast.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Before heading to the gate, we always seem to stop off here for a bite to eat. My wife ordered the hot oatmeal and coffee; my order was a bagel with peanut butter (.95 cents) and coffee. It seems since Paradise Bakery left the area, there aren't too many places were you can order something quick.
My wife enjoyed her oatmeal and the coffee is always steaming HOT. My bagel was dense and very filling. If I had the bagel plain with butter, it might have went down a little better."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for coffee/danish when I am connecting through Sky Harbor in terminal B.  They do a great job with their espresso drinks and their danish/sandwich selection is fantastic and fresh.  They also do salads however I have never tried one.  I am usually all about their Caramel Latte and Croissant!  The prices are reasonable for the airport and they have really great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here with friends. It gets busy so be prepared to hunt for a table.

My sandwich was fresh and filled with good quality turkey and the side salad was  fresh, crisp and delicious.

I couldn't resist a few cookies to go - the chocolate chip was the winner between it and the sugar cookie."}
{"text":"Took my boys on a lunch date here, while we waited for their hair cutting appointments (in the same strip mall). It was Sunday, so pretty busy. The service was excellent. They brought us extra bread and even free cookies, since the food was a bit delayed. The tomato basil soup was outstanding, as well as the buffalo chicken sandwich. Their bread is baked fresh and tastes great. My boys tried my soup and said it was \"the best soup they've ever had.\" Kids' meals as very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. I tried their new spicy lemon penne! It was so tasty! I also shared it with my son, and he like it too. I hope they keep
This dish on their regular menu! It's usually very busy on Friday, however, I call my order in to speed up the time it takes to wait. all the dishes I have tried have been full of flavor and enjoyable. I just wish it wasn't so busy here. Lol!"}
{"text":"A serious step above the typical airport food. The breakfast and lunch options are more than basic and there are plenty of options with fresh vegetables and fruit.

On the way to the register are prepared foods such as sandwiches, salads, and baked goodies. The salads were really nice salads with good toppings, not crummy iceberg trying to pass for salad. The overhead menu offers the hot options that can be ordered.

My husband and I both ordered Ultimate Bacon & Egg Sandwiches. It was a nice sized sandwich. The ingredients were fresh and the sandwich overall was tasty. I also ordered a Rice Krispy that had chocolate drizzle on top. That was really good and also a large portion. Our orders came out quickly even though they were very busy. A travel must!"}
{"text":"Casandra provides great service with a smile. She often suggests new items to try and it's always a pleasure coming to this location. 
My only suggestion and it has been disappointing is the size change in the scones, not much cheaper and a lot less scone ."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one to leave reviews for places online but my recent visit to Wildflower changed that. This was my first time here and when I walked in immediately I felt a much more welcoming atmosphere than that of Paradise or Panera, which everyone seems to compare it to but in reality it's no contest. The counter staff was very friendly, particularly Alyssa was a delight. Having never been here before I was a bit indecisive and had a lot of questions, but she was wonderful and gladly answered all of my questions. She offered some great suggestions for me and ultimately I ordered the Chipotle Spinach salad, and boy am I glad I did. After the food came out which took absolutely no time at all I have to say honestly this is one of the best salads I've had anywhere in the Valley. Especially for the price, it's the best bang for your buck. I don't know what they put in that dressing but oh my God it is so delicious, which really I recommend if you're trying to eat healthy because I'm trying to cut carbs and that salad really hits the spot. And that says a lot considering the phenomenal smell of all the baked goodies here!! It was definitely tempting and you bet I'll be coming back here for more on one of my cheat days! I think I've found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I have tried various bread and pastries from this location. The cranberry bagels and scones are huge and packed. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Our first time here! We decided to try this place after a morning at the Railroad Park. There were 8 in our party and everyone loved their meals! 

The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had and I liked the addition of the marinated mushrooms. The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious!!  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in the Phoenix area, we like to eat at Wildflower Bread Company. This was my first time visiting this location and once again I was impressed with the service. We ordered a fairly large order to go and it took a bit longer than normal; the manager kept us updated and was very friendly. He also gave us free cookies because we had a longer wait.

The food was delicious and our experience amazing!! We will be back and I highly recommend restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how this location has 4 stars... I have never had a worse wildflower experience.

I ordered the Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich with the Potato Cream Cheese soup (because duh!) I basically only received half of my order because my sandwich was the SADDEST sandwich ever. It was figs and tomato... I didn't even have ONE sweet potato, it's like they didn't even try. 

My boyfriend got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and Chicken Caesar salad. He had a really sad sandwich as well considering it was all bread and the tiniest piece of chicken ever... it was smaller than a nugget. 

The only saving grace was the potato soup and the salad, but I probably won't be back to Wildflower for a very long time, if ever.

We agreed it was the worst $25 we have ever spent."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a long time and not once has this place let us down. Best place to have lunch & dinner with friends, families and co workers. I love this place, the food is so good I love there salmon Alfredo super yummy the down side is that they don't serve there pasta until 3pm which is lame but very understandable which makes it worth the wait lol. and there passion fruit tea bomb af can never get enough of there awesome tea. Also there pastries are very Delicious had there cinnamon bun with lots of frosting loved it! but most of all the service is so efficient, fast and very reliable. The Employees are great and have a smile on there face and know how to take care of the customer. Hope they keep it up because that goes a long way but I'll be returning always. I never have once had a bad vibe from this place....Nothing but awesome vibes"}
{"text":"Really good food. Just wish they'd make pasta before 3pm. Soups are always tasty. Service is good and mostly fast."}
{"text":"After passing this place many times I decided to finally stop in. I ordered the three cheese ravioli since that's what people seemed to reccomend the most. Got two orders, one for my boyfriend and one for myself. The cashier forgot the second one so manager comped it for us super sweet man who definitely made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The food was great so we decided to also try the carrot cake which was also good. I would definitely come back in the near future."}
{"text":"Still haven't heard back from Louis after more than a month. Perhaps the customers aren't as much of a priority as they would like you to believe."}
{"text":"With some extra time before a delayed flight we find ourselves at Wildflower for some snacks. The food was good no question. But what impressed us most was the service. An incredibly friendly team of people!  And while sitting and eating two different people stopped to ask us if we needed anything and how our food was. Unexpected in an airport counter service food area. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Ok why have I never come here before? I think a less than average experience at another similar style restaurant deterred me but I have been missing out.  This place is great!  My husband and I both ordered salads (chipotle spinach and chopped) and they were delicious!!!!!  He also thoroughly enjoyed a chocolate chip cookie.  The other desserts and pastries looked amazing.  I can't wait to return as all their menu items sounded tempting.  I'll be returning at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I visited in May, service and food were great. However I was charged twice for my purchase. I have requested a refund 3 times as today. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Real bread, real food, amazing deserts, great breakfast. Order and pay at the counter, they deliver to your table. I had a roasted vegetable frittata. My husband had a breakfast sandwich. Both were good.

 My breakfast came with buttered toast. It was chewy with high protein which was developed from kneeding high quality wheat. The waitress brought me a small tub of catchup for my fried red potatoes. Neither Jack or I had much interest in the potatoes.  We over ate as was with the ample servings. 

I purchased a large loaf of multigrain bread to go. The \"Ultimate Chocolate Cake\" looks amazing. It took all my willpower to resist taking a slice to go. 

Where I would normally purchase a loaf of multigrain bread from Costco, now I will purchase here, when possible."}
{"text":"Perfect place to stop and eat before my flight! Healthy, filling and the service was great. Everyone was so helpful. Nikaeus M. in particular was awesome! Will be my go-to next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Healthy yes. Tasty meh. Small portions. Ate my whole sandwich in about 5 bites. Big bonus though for being 24 hours."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, the staff was great but t took almost 40 minutes to get a basic salad. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.

Update:  after noticing how long I had waited, the manager gave me me a gift card for lunch on them next time. I really appreciated this after such a long wait."}
{"text":"Was feeling under the weather and stopped in for some soup. I was surprised to see Portuguese Sausage and bean soup on the menu. Whoa, it hit the spot! Anyone from HI who loves Portuguese Bean Soup needs to try this. It tastes just like your Aunty makes it, I promise. It was the comfort food I needed."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, quality ingredients, and friendly service. Wildflower is a nice casual lunch spot. You order, pick a seat, then they bring your food to you. I enjoy the salads...specifically the chopped salad with salmon, and I can't go and not get their green tea, it's delicious! The management at this location is wonderful and always go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience today. You can tell the level of management/cooks is subpar for this place now. Ordered a sausage and egg sandwich and a bagel today. Asked for toasted bread on sandwich received a pasty white bread sandwich no toasting to it and the bagel was burned. Told them to remake it when the supposed manager came out a girl with a bun and shaved sides no nametag. She had he audacity to come out and say that the baker burned the bagels so that by toasting it only got darker ? Who comes up with that excuse ? Why admit your baker burned the bagels, that would mean you openly admitted to serving bad product. Another gentleman came out after and apologized I believe he was another manager he was a lot more professional and nicer."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!

I have been here several times and the service is always courteous and the food is always delightful.  I've had pastas, sandwiches, soups, salads, and it is all tasty.  My most recent meal was butternut squash ravioli in a walnut cream sauce.  Yum.  The pastries are always calling to me - especially that flower-shaped chocolate chip scone.  My fiance doesn't know what a scone is, but that chocolate chip one has him wanting to find out.  The breakfast menu looks scrumptious and I will definitely come in the morning to check it out once I can finally remember (other than when I am there for lunch or dinner and see the breakfast menu and then remind my fiance, again, that we need to go there for b-fast.).  It's a vicious cycle.  My only complaint is that it can get super busy and with one area for drinks, it can get a little chaotic, especially if there are some slow folks or parents with bratty kids.  I have found the later you go, the less chance of bratty kids, which is always a plus in my book.  Hopefully earlier will prove to be the same.  Lunch hour can be a beast when it comes to finding a table, but well worth it once you find one.  The sandwiches are generously portioned and all of the prices are reasonable.  Two people can definitely eat dinner for around $15-$20."}
{"text":"Wrote some feedback on Yelp and heard from someone \"upstairs\" VERY QUICKLY. Extremely impressed..."}
{"text":"Love this place! The variety in the menu is great and presents quality food! I definitely recommend the Caesar salad with salmon and capers if you are looking for something Keto-friendly. Also, their green tea with guava is great and will definitely give you your caffeine kick for the work day. Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.

There's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.

This location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.

If you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"I've got to give mad props to any business that really checks up on it's Yelp reviews!  While I gave Wildflower a positive four star review, I did point out a few things about the location and restaurant that I did not like.  Wildflower's founder, Louis, contacted me to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the parking situation outside the restaurant, and to show me where customers could find nutritional information and ways to order their meals to fit their dietary needs.

While stopping in for a soup and half sandwich order for lunch, I decided to try a baked good on this visit.  It was just a chocolate chip cookie, nothing crazy, but I've got to say it was a very tasty cookie.  Perhaps a scone or muffin will be in order next time I drive by."}
{"text":"This wildflower has the look, feel, and [most importantly] delicious food as any other in the valley.  The space is a little smaller and tighter than most of the other locations I've been too, but it does have some outdoor seating to make up for it.  What really sets this location apart from the others is that it shares an open wall with the book store next door.  I can't explain why, but it really adds to the ambiance.

My only complaint is the parking lot, which is something that Wildflower itself cannot help.  The shopping center is packed with some big stores and restaurants, and barely has enough spaces to accommodate a Saturday afternoon lunch crowd.  Oddly enough, I've noticed this problem that a couple of other Wildflowers."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, gave the kids extra cookies. Fast service, clean, little tight with the seating though. Bread bowls were good. Spaghetti was mediocre. My wife enjoys this place more than me."}
{"text":"For me the food here is 5 stars. I love the options and the quality is always on point. They have so many vegetarian meals and are very open about the nutritional content of the food. Bakery items are pretty tasty for a chain bakery. This location is just so very busy. I have always waited in long lines and the layout is poor. People waiting for food after ordering get in the way of people waiting to order or people trying to get drinks. To gos just take so long you might as well stay and eat (if you can find a table)."}
{"text":"Nice place, only complaint is the sandwich bread is really hard.  Went with my grandparents and a friend. I ordered a BLT plus and friend ordered a chicken Pesto on ciabatta bread.  Both breads were way over cooked and the Ciabatta bread was impossible to eat.  The BLT bread reminded me of eating Captain Crunch as a kid, it tore up the roof of my mouth."}
{"text":"Lucky for me there was no line so no wait. I ordered the half tomato, basil, pesto sandwich with a fruit cup. I wanted something healthier than a burger and fries. Alright for $11 food at an airport. The sandwich was good but I think it would have been better panini style. The melons and grapes in the fruit salad tasted about a day away from being too old.
Not grand but not horrible but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best potato soup ever. The French toast is awesome and the roast beef with gorgonzola is amazing. The turkey Brest and brie - yum. I love how they put their menu together. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"At Wildflower Bread Co. I can always count on having a good sandwich, soup, or salad.  All salads and soups are accompanied by a thick chunk of their home baked bread.   The bread is the best artisan bread I've tasted - chewy with a crunchy crust, it is sold by the loaf, in many varieties.  

Although it was busy on a weekday lunch hour, I was able to find a table.  And after a half hour there were plenty of seats.  

I ordered a soup and salad combo. My Wildflower salad was flavorful with fresh greens and chopped vegetables.  The big cup of spicy green chili bisque was excellent.  To go with I chose a slice of their monthly special Jalapeno Cheddar bread.  It was spicy and tasty, good enough to make me purchase a loaf to bring home.  

For dessert a huge chocolate chip scone, big enough for two people.  Delicious - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a quick bite at the airport. Arrived to the terminal just in time to catch my connecting flight. Wildflower Bread Company was just across from my gate. Busy day at the airport due to holiday travelers but the service was in and out. Very efficiently organized: You go in one way, place your order, walk to the other side of the shop, pic up and off you go. No lines, unlike Starbucks. The staff was very friendly and chatty. I do not know how they keep their cool among the bustle at the airport. Plenty of sandwiches, salads and soup options. I got a half Brie and pesto turkey sandwich to go. The bread was good, fresh and was the right texture. Not soggy not too thick not too dry.  It did not fall apart when I unwrapped it later on the plane. The pesto nor the sun dried tomatoes were oily, the flavors were good. The lettuce was fresh and crisp. The size of the half sandwich was perfect and the coffee was hot and strong."}
{"text":"Today was the best experience I've ever had at wildflower thanks to Evan, one outstanding employee. Not only was he hard working and always making sure the tables were clean but his customer service went above and beyond!! There was a disabled woman eating alone at a table near us, and he was more then helpful without her even asking. Even going out of his way to hold open the door for her when she was leaving! As I was leaving with my mom he made a comment about us and how wonderful the food was and how he hoped we had an excellent day. His great smile and positive personality would be an outstanding addition and asset to any company."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let everyone know if u get the turkey and brie sandwich. lately they have been going really light o. the red peppers.  they'll put on extra if u ask when ordering though."}
{"text":"Super busy on a Saturday but the staff was all very friendly and apologetic.  Food has always been amazing every time I've come.  They were accommodating and made the blt keto friendly but wrapping it in lettuce.  They threw in a few cookies because of the wait and it was much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The quality of wildflowers' food is superb.  Really friendly staff.  My only qual with this Restaraunt is the fact that the average meal costs you ~10 bucks and it is not nearly enough food to fill you up.  I feel this place is catered towards woman, maybe that has something to do with the portions. But overall not a bad little sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches, sides, and a bakery to boot!  The place gets packed at lunch so come early or be prepared to wait a few minutes for service.  With that being said, they were very efficient with taking care of the influx of guests that were there at the same time I was.
 Overall, the location was very clean, employees nice, and the food was very fresh and tasty.  I had a roast beef sandwich with a side and a delicious fresh brewed iced tea.  They have free Wi-Fi to use while you're there as well.  If I'm back in the area I'll definitely stop my again."}
{"text":"The only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is the line out the door. That said, I stopped here twice on a recent weekend trip to Scottsdale . We stayed nearby, and had a delicious salad and sandwiches one day, and picked up a box of baked goods to share with the family we were visiting. The cranberry scones are the bomb ! Everything was really scrumptious , wish we had one in SoCal !!"}
{"text":"Ray was awesome. She was very nice and had excellent customer service. My husband and I enjoyed a delicious breakfast of oatmeal, pancakes lemon ricotta and french toast for me. Eveything was yummy. I will be telling everybody to come have some delicious eats here. And make sure to say hi to Ray she is great!"}
{"text":"I had this for the first time yesterday. I had the Caesar chicken salad and it was really delicious. I can't wait to go back and try different things there Mac N Cheese looks promising so I definitely can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Well one star goes to the staff all of whom were nice, if a bit inflexible with their soup and half sandwich deal.  Full-sized ultimate grilled cheese was overpriced for portion (8.29) and wasn't filling, it was ultimately disappointing, as the grill was also a bit overdone drying out the challah to an unpleasant crisp.  The mango passion fruit lemonade tasted like too sweet reconstituted frozen lemonade and overpowered the mango and passion fruit flavored that were supposed to be there. Also the music was too loud and annoying. Will not eat here again when we fly through."}
{"text":"Today was my first time to Wildflower Bread Bakery. I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic Reuben sandwich and potato salad. It beats many other Reuben sandwiches by far. The first thing that hit me was the amount of meat and the flavor was truly amazing. The sauerkraut and sauce complimented the meat perfectly and did not overpower it. The bread was delicious and easy to enjoy, knowing it was gluten-free. 

Frank, the manager, was so personable and accommodating to any of our needs. He is the epitome of  genuine first-class customer service. 

The location is easy-access, close to shopping and not a far distance from two casinos. Any local or traveler can enjoy their healthy dishes. I've only heard good about this  place.

Thank you Frank and the Wildflower Bread Company for making our visit a wonderful memory!"}
{"text":"Turkey BLT and Potato Cream Cheese soup are both good. Even better when you do the half soup half sandwich combo. Better alternative to Panda Express next door"}
{"text":"Got 2 sandwiches ,one turkey ,one roast beef with Gorgonzola along with a clam chowder's bread for both sandwiches was so hard It was almost a joke.Not much meat either.My Friend wound up throwing hers away.I was starving and ate mine but it was an unejoyable chore to do so.The Soup was fine ,nothing to write home about.Being from Boston I'm spoiled by really good sandwich's was a disappointment and I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Love Wildflower. I have been going to WF for 20 years. Always love the fresh food. It always tastes great and the service is always great as well! The Arrowhead location is so nice. Love the outdoor seating. The staff is awesome.  Stephanie, our cashier was so helpful. My daughter is gluten free and she made great suggestions. Even Ryan, who washes, Shaun and Brenden, who cook, and the manager Rebecca were helpful and smiling. Emily served us the food and was willing to get us whatever we needed. Great experience as usual!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Met a friend at Wildflower based on a recommendation and really enjoyed the food and the vibe. My new lunch spot for sure. Want to try the dinner menu too! Christian (server) was helpful and recommended the Spicy Lemon Penne when i return, can't wait!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate Salad.
I'm pretty picky with salads and this is one of the few I can eat relatively regularly.
The other items are also pretty good, their pesto sandwich is pretty good.
I come here for a salad though :)"}
{"text":"Yes, I am giving a chain 5 stars. Calm down Phoenix Foodies.  

This Wildflower is always:
Fresh
Appetizing
Clean
Consistent
Friendly
Delicious, most importantly
...and always gets the to-go order right, even when a bunch of annoying women are substituting things."}

Got out of bed this morning specifically to go and pick up the special order I'd placed for Currant-caraway Irish soda bread, which was slated for 8a.  I arrived around at around 830a, but none of the bags already prepared had my name on it.  After checking and re-checking the bags for my name and not finding any, the mid-50s to early-60s' female clerk finally grabbed one out of the shelves.  She then asked if I wanted it sliced, and I said yes, but quickly asked if I could get half of the bread sliced up now.  She said she could cut the bread in half, and I thought that she would follow the instructions through.  When I saw her package the two halves together in one bag, I asked if she could take half of the bread and put it through the slicer, and she said \"whatever you want.\"  To round out the transaction, I had a cranberry scone added to my order.

I had a little sample of the bread while driving back home, and it was good, but not as great as those tiny rolls I tried at the Yelp party eleven days ago.  I much-prefer the smaller ratio of crust to tender bread.

Here's to healthy eating!  As with most things in life, enjoy carbs with moderation!  :)"}
{"text":"4/7/10
Have I mentioned how I love the cranberry scones at Wildflower Bread Co.??  They're very moist and studded with gorgeous dried cranberries... My favorite part to eat, being a crunchy food-lover, is the super-flaky, caramelized crust!  

The only reason I don't rate w/ 5 stars is because the last time I bought a few from this location, the crust flavor tasted \"off,\" as if another lipid was used to cook them with, or that the butter used was slightly rancid.  They definitely did not taste as fresh as the others I've purchased here before."}
{"text":"11/17/10

And yet, another WBC update- this time it's regarding the \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich, which was basically oven-roasted turkey, sage stuffing, and cranberry jam on delicious whole-grain bread.  Had the opportunity to try bite-sized samples at a Yelp event a few days before this visit and enjoyed it so much, I had to have a full sandwich soon after!  Well, OK, so I shared the other half w/ a petite cousin of mine-- she absolutely loved it! 

We swore that the next time, we'd get our own Thanksgiving sandwiches.  No sharing!

Doing last-minute Christmas shopping FOR MYSELF, I soon felt hunger pangs and WBC was calling my name!  (It's so nice to know that I can always count on WBC for a tasty meal for those times I don't feel like hauling across the valley in search for good eats!)  The aromas that permeated the air as I approached its warm and intimate setting told me that I made the right decision to eat here.  I quickly peruse the menu, thinking I'd have the Butternut squash ravioli that appeared in so many OYEs this year, but lo!  What do I see?  WBC's added a few new sandwiches, and one hot option jumped at me, and its name was \"Braised Beef,\" ($7.99).  I'll try that one, please!

The braised beef was TOPPED w/ rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes, served on a grilled ciabatta roll, and accompanied w/ au jus and horseradish sauce, w/ a side of both regular and sweet potato chips.  Let me tell you, the beef and mashed potato combo was incredible!  I ate the whole sandwich!  (Well, all of the beef and potatoes and half of the ciabatta roll.  Gotta keep a svelte figure, y'know?  LOL.)  I'm going to have to order this again the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"We frequent this location often and overall we are highly satisfied. Some menu items are hit and miss. I definitely do not recommend the mixed berry french toast if you like butter and maple syrup with your french toast, or at least ask for these items. I do recommend the chocolate chip scones. I always get a few for later. I also always get their seasonal items as well which tend to be very good. Staff is friendly and always is quick to fix any issues. Weekend during brunch tends to get busy so plan on being their for a bit."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!  I loved this place and wish we had one in Austin.  We ordered 2 tuna sandwiches and a chicken salad.  The tuna was better.  But the bread on both and all the fresh veggies were incredible.  I'll visit again the next time I'm in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"I love getting the half soup (the potato cream cheese)  and half sand (typically I get the BLT and add some Turkey!). 

Its a great place to get out of the office as they have electrical outlets at almost every table so be sure to bring your laptop and enjoy the free wifi."}
{"text":"I've got to tell everyone about the fantastic sandwich I got over at Wildflower....I might have to make it a regular stop now.  It was the turkey-pastrami with coleslaw and cheese.  Man was this sandwich great, very sweet combination with the turkey and grilled cheese style sandwich.  I like this place but I had never really found an addictive meal here till this past weekend with my family.  I dont like Paradise Bakery but this place is great, the atmosphere is really nice and the service was great, the guy behind the counter recommended the sandwich and I was grateful for that.  This location is a crazy parking lot but worth the visit."}
{"text":"Cassandra recommended something I didn't even have my eye on and it was the best lunch I've ever had. Thanks Cassandra!"}
{"text":"Great salads & breads. First one I ever ate at was in Sedona Arizona. Can't say enough good about the large yummy salads."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service as always. Their chopped salad with chicken is so  yummy.

 I am very disappointed to learn that the pesto vinaigrette that comes with the chopped salad is made with soy bean oil tho. I work hard to stay away from soy and GMO products. I don't  think this salad would be as good with another dressing either.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"I love their slogan, \"Eat Well, Be Well!\". Perfect location for me to grab breakfast after my meditation class. It's your standard Wildflower Bread Company, and  If you've never eaten at this chain, you should. A lot of healthy and tasty options, very friendly staff, and a great selection of teas too. I love their peppermint teas, and it's nice to see that they have Stevia on their coffee condiments counter. Fantastic salads and sandwiches, ideal for a casual meal.  They can make anything vegetarian too, so it's perfect for me. They have plenty of seating, and the WiFi is very reliable, so if you just want to have coffee, and chill. It's a perfect spot since they also have plenty of parking space."}
{"text":"Keep up the good work Wildflower, and thank you for offering vegetarian and vegan options.  I brought my mom here on valentine's day for lunch after our spa treatment. My mom liked it. We sat outside since the weather was beautiful, but they also have plenty of seating area inside. They have vegan soups, and on the particular day that we visited. I ordered the vegan corn and green chili soup, and my mom got the mushroom kale bisque.  You cannot go wrong with either one. They also have a great selection of teas! The staff is friendly, and the service is fast. I also witnessed the manager handled an irate customer with professionalism. The sandwiches are fantastic! I didn't think I'd like the sweet potato sandwich, but it was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Have to update review to mention the Banana Nut Loaf.....it is delicious! We bought a loaf to go during our last lunch trip here and ate it all the next day! It was really fresh, moist and full of flavor the best Banana Bread my husband and I have ever had."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers at Wildflower for many years. This past weekend we ordered a cake from Wildflower for a 60th Birthday party. When I called to place the order on Saturday the employee said they would put it on the delivery order for later that day. I called later in the evening and the order had never been placed. Another employee said she would put it on the order for the next day's delivery (just in time for the party), but when I called the next day again the order was never placed and there was no cake available anywhere in the valley. We were very frustrated as we now had no cake for the Birthday celebration. The manager at this Wildflower escalated the issue to the VP who to make things right paid for our entire meal at the resturaunt where we were celebrating. He truly was genuinely sorry for the mix up and we could not belie how above and beyond Wildflower went. They really do have good food and we will now remain loyal customers."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy spot to grab lunch before heading through security. I had an excellent sandwich and my wife has a great breakfast. Good people watching vantage point and the food was out quickly."}
{"text":"It good. It's not oh my god amazing like some of the reviews I saw on this place but I would definitely come back and try something else on the menu. Nice atmosphere and good food. Easy 4 stars!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a place similar to, but better than, paradise bakery, long wait at lunch but SOOOO delicious. I will always eat here when I can! My favorite is the salmon chopped salad with arugula. I'm usually not a big fish person and never really loved salmon but it is the perfect combination in this salad. Not your typical salad. I also love the frittata for breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"I love wildflower and all your new fall options! frank went above and beyond helping us decide on what new menu items to try based on what we usually get! He was so nice! Double checked everything in our order to make sure we weren't leaving without anything. I just wish there was another location in old town scottsdale but I will always come back to this one"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The best soup/sand which combo you can find.  You must try their BLT Plus sandwich if you like that type of thing...all of their soups are amazing.  Even the vegetarian ones, which i get mainly...and normally I'm not into the vegetarian thing!  I have not tried the breakfast, but if one were closer to me, I would guarantee you, I would buy stock in the place and throw away my pots and pans!  Plus, they have wonderful sweet treats to put an end to a fabulous lunch!  Their bread for sale is wonderful and makes amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yummy egg breakfasts.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Great environment.  Free wifi.

Also....there is usually a community copy of the NY Times you can snag to catch up.  I love that they keep their staff happy and they don't turn over every three weeks.   A real sense of community.

Parking is a bit scarce around lunch time....but I'm usually there for breakfast/coffee so I never have a problem."}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Co recently catered an event I worked at and I knew I had to review them! Not sure where to start and I am admittedly writing this knowing I can review all of their items because I sampled one of each (this mistake totally derailed my diet)- they were just that good. Tried the raspberry cream cheese croissant, chocolate croissant, blueberry muffin, low-fat chocolate muffin, chocolate chip scone, cranberry scone, morning glory muffin, turkey and brie sandwich, ham and swiss sandwich, tuna sandwich, chocolate chip cookie, cranberry oatmeal cookie and coffee. Wowwwww that's scary writing all of that down. Highlights are the Chocolate croissant and morning glory muffin. Both were phenomenal and my top picks. The morning glory is like a spiced muffin (almost like carrot cake or pumpkin?) idk but was delicious! The blueberry muffin and raspberry cream cheese croissant were both amazing as well. The scones (chocolate and cranberry) were both good- don't get me wrong, but I liked the other much better. Scones seemed a little dry and crumbly and not as sweet as they should be. Coffee was great! Chocolate chip cookies were phenomenal, huge, moist and basically half chocolate- just how I like it, Cranberry oatmeal cookie was alright, but I'm a huge chocolate person so thinking the choc chip cookie downplayed it. 

As far as sandwiches- the turkey and brie absolutely knocked it out of the park- wowwwww so great and the mustard!!! The mustard. The mustard is phenomenal, super grainy and really flavorful. Definitely tastes house made. The ham was also super good, tuna I wasn't super wowed but still decent. 

Overall this place is absolutely great, not a Panera copy cat at all, seems very self made and has a selection not like any other bakery ive been to. When I'm back in Phoenix, this is the first place I'm coming to!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite delicious! I went with my entire family one evening, and we were all satisfied. I had a Hummus Plate, which was mostly delicious. Some of the roasted veggies were cold, which I wasn't really happy with. The hummus itself was delicious, though! The Roasted Garlic Tomato Soup was the best Tomato Soup I've ever had in any restaurant, by the way! I think they only serve it on Monday's, so if you're a fan and have the chance... I'd definitely suggest it!"}
{"text":"Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks! 

Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.

He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.

Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????"}
{"text":"The staff was amazing as usual and especially on Mother's Day. The sweetest lady was working - Sort of greeting people. I don't know her name, but I overheard that she's been there for a long time, like 10 or so years. She gave us a complimentary loaf of bread for Mother's Day and made my grandma smile. Thank you!!  Wildflower customer for life. Also thank you all for taking the time away from your loved ones to work on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Well rounded menu. Super Friendly Staff! Delicious food. THANK YOU ITZEL!!! I love a place that makes you feel wanted. Good first experience. WAY TO GO WBC!!!"}
{"text":"While I dont expect the best at the airport, I do expect the coffee to at least be drinkable. Ordered an iced mocha, she served coffee and milk. No sweetness at all, she forgot the chocolate. Okay. So I asked if they could please remake it. She took my coffee, poured a ton of chocolate syrup on it, and shoved it back to me. Not a great way to be treated... I just wanted a decent coffee, man..."}
{"text":"A step above the typical airport salad. The Vegetable Quinoa Salad with chicken was very fresh and had great flavors. Also had a yummy smoothie. I wish food like this was available at more airports."}
{"text":"Perfect place if you are in the mood for a light and healthy meal. I normally opt for the Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate Salad as it is packed with flavor and very filling. You can't really go wrong with anything there though. Always one of my top lunch places and a great place to get some work done as well."}
{"text":"A long-time favorite! The potato cream cheese soup is amazing. Shout out to Anthony, for his stellar service!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and before ordering I used the restroom. There is a saying in the restaurant business, that a restaurant is only as clean as its bathroom. If that is true this place is a S$%thole. The toilet seat had urine encrusted on the underneath side and I'm talking a good thick line of it. Months worth of nastiness being left under there. The only reason I discovered it was that the seat was so dirty, I decided to lift the lid and hover. Sorry for the visual. After washing my hands, I found a manager, told him exactly what I wrote here and I left. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"The menu was very diverse.  What a refreshing change from standard breakfast fare.  I had a Greek frittata that tasted super fresh.  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich that came on bread that was soft as a cloud.  I wish we had one of these in San Diego - Arizona is a bit of a trek for breakfast."}
{"text":"The second time I asked for my bread loaf sliced, the machine chewed up the top half of the break I ordered. They need to update the bread slicer."}
{"text":"I had walked by this restaurant many times and never had the time to check it out. Glad I finally did. I ordered the mushroom soup in a bread bowl. Fresh delicious bread to soak up the delicious soup, filled with hearty beautiful mushrooms. My husband got the chicken Caesar salad. He loved it. This place is similar to Paradise Bakery or Panera, but I think it may be just a tad bit better. I will check it out again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great. Whenever my order is wrong its fixed no problem and often offered a complimentary dessert to help smooth the situation. The staff is friendly, helpful and looks actually happy to be working there! I'd definitely love it if their vegetarian soup selection was more often but I am very satisfied with what I have had there. I have not ever had a bad experience there. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick place to get some quality food with actual customer service!"}
{"text":"Love the new mac and cheese was delicious! 
Had wonderful service , even though I came in close to closing time. Thanks to Ray, JR, Kelsey & Lexia for the wonderful experience and great food"}
{"text":"Just ate there today and I have say they have good food. I had the ham and Swiss sandwich and it was great. Friendly staff, and very clean inside. The only thing is the side of potato salad I got with my sandwich was about 2 bites, very tasty but I wish they would give more. All in all it was a good experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the service is excellent. Today I tried the protein breakfast bowl with over easy eggs and i was amazed at how delicious it was. The front counter girl told me it was one of her favorite so i tried it and I thank her. So far everything i tried was really good and fresh."}
{"text":"Similar to Paradise but with the Panera takeover and Paradise changing this place is a nice alternative. Great bread and different menu items."}
{"text":"Just want to let everyone know how awesome Taylor is. Customer service A+

She came from behind the counter to help me carry things because I was by myself.

I'm also very happy that they are a local company.
Breads are always as close to European good as you can get here."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service from Daniel, Jessica, and Jonathan! I will be back again because of our great experience!"}
{"text":"I look forward to my morning flights out of PHX because it means I get to grab breakfast here. The staff is always smiling, the coffee is hot and delish, and the food is fantastic. 

I had a mocha and the spicy chipotle egg sandwich for breakfast before a flight home. Best damn breakfast sammich I've had in a very long time...and I'm a girl who knows her breakfast sammies. Grab a bite and a coffee here, you won't be disappointed. 

I would post photos but the sammich was gone before I thought to. #noshame"}
{"text":"One of the finest gourmet sandwiches to gorge on. Not pricey and food served is worth your money :)"}
{"text":"Had their grilled cheese sandwich with a side of coleslaw yesterday for lunch. I had the WORST stomachache for a few hours afterwards. Something was bad, not sure if it was the sandwich or the coleslaw but I went be returning for a $12 afternoon of nausea. Food safety should always be #1."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so disappointed, I go to wildflower all the time sadly my first time at this location. I was told 10-15 mins for my order so I said ok I will have it for here thinking I would have plenty of time to get back to work. 25 mins later I track someone down and ask to make my order to go as I need to get to work. The lady next to me is also complaining her order was taking longer they come out give her, her order and tell her they are refunding her order. I am in no way looking for a hand out but then I tell her again I need to leave she tracks down my food hands it to me and walks away. No apology no nothing. I check my order when I get to my car and my hot braised beef sandwich is cold cheese not even melted and to top that off I missed my lunch all together with. I am so disappointed and will not come back to this location 


Ok so I was recently contacted by Wildflower and was sent an apology letter with a gift card to come back to this location so I did today 5/11/18.  The woman at the counter greeted me right away, I ordered my fave the BLT Plus. My food came fairly quickly, and fresh. Everything was great! I've always been a fan of Wildflower just had a bad experience that time, but they redeemed today for sure."}
{"text":"I went there in a Sunday afternoon and Frank was the manager, he was extremely rude he was cleaning the restaurant asking me no move cause I was in his way!"}
{"text":"I'm a Paradise Bakery loyalist (I was one of the few people not all that excited at first about the Panera take over, but I've come to not only to accept it, but really like it). That being said every time I come to Wildflower (which isn't that often) I realize I like it more that I thought. 

I can't remember the the last time I had any \"real\" food here (sandwiches, salads, soups...). I think I had a breakfast sandwich awhile back that I remember being good. They do have really good pastries here! The chocolate chip scone that's SO GOOD! I've gotten it the last few times I came here. Also, for what's it worth, my nephew really likes the turkey sandwich on the kids menu (which is a pretty simple thing, I know). He's a picky eater, so this is one of the few places I don't mind taking him to. 

One complaint I have...no iced coffee refills. It's plain old brewed iced coffee just like Panera/Paradise Bakery and they do refills. 

Overall this is a good, higher quality chain restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Highly recommend the roasted sweet  potato  sandwich or the pasta primavera.  Great job folks!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and soups. Very unique tasting stuff here. Their salads are also good. I usually do the wildflower pick two, and I'm never really disappointed. I'm usually not into these 'bread company' places, but I think this place is unique. I've really only been here for lunch and dinner so I can't comment on breakfast, but I know they serve it. 

The pick two combo is amazing for price, I'm not sure I'd go for any of the other stuff. The chai latte was also surprisingly good. Service is excellent, and food is always served promptly. NEVER had an issue when I went here. Great, consistent, good food. 

soup/bread boules (i think they spell it weird) are good too. this place is DEFINITELY worth a look."}
{"text":"While the food is decent, service and parking could be better. The parking lot is very narrow and it's very hard to find a spot around lunchtime. I had to circle the lot a few times before someone luckily pulled out of their spot.

At the ordering counter, the cashier seemed flustered at my order (1 soup and 1 medium soda), and asked me 3 times (Each time I answered yes) if I was eating in. After she took my order and I paid, she then ran to the chef's station, disappearing for a little bit. She did not ask if I wanted a receipt before she ran off. 

The food itself was decent. The soup came in a good sized bowl and the bread was slightly toasted and went well with it.

Around lunchtime it is also hard to find a spot to sit as well. I was lucky and grabbed the last table available. 

I love eating at the Wildflower in Tempe, but due to the plethora of sandwich shops in this area, I might only come here to get a to go order based on my experience here at lunch."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious sandwiches, and good sides as well.  The sweet potato sandwich is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The owner of the store made the situation right by contacting me. I wish more owners would realize this is a good way to make things right and keep customers who had a bad experience."}
{"text":"In a word... Underrated. This place consistently delivers a variety of fresh and healthy dishes and great baked goods too at ridiculously reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Picked my poison at the airport in Phoenix during a lay over and chose Wild Flower. Man things are pricey in air ports. Wish it wasn't so. Got the half soup and sandwich. Got the turkey blt plus. Which came on Challah bread. The bread for me was too think and I took the bottom part off. It was cold too which I knew but wished it was hot. The ingredients were fresh which is good. 

I was disappointed they didn't have souls with meat not even a nice chicken noodle. Damn damn damn. But on the bright side they had a mushroom soup which was chalk full of mushrooms seemed like shiitake too. It was pretty darn good. I can't turn down those  fungi. 

They had other yummy bakery items but I figured I shouldn't since illl be indulging enough on this trip. Overall. Not bad but not great. Service was friendly  as well which was nice."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious! The prices are great! The service is always amazing, it's all around incredible. I highly suggest that you try it, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious...the food taste wonderful and the staff/managers really enjoy what they do.

Thank you Wildflower.

Richard"}
{"text":"I always come to wildflower on a Sunday and it is always packed for good reason! The service is prompt and all of the staff are nice even when it can seem chaotic. They're food is always fresh and super healthy! I always recommend his location!"}
{"text":"Loved it you get what you pay for. Generous healthy portions great variety of soups salads and sandwiches. Great bread and yummy deserts."}
{"text":"Wildflower is a good place if you're looking for decent food and free wifi.  I had some time before a work appointment.  The place reminds me of an upscale Panera.  I ordered a three-cheese grilled cheese sandwich with chips, a blood orange limeade and a chocolate croissant.  The sandwich was pretty good and the blood orange limeade was spectacular.  I was looking forward to the dessert however and it was hard and stale.  I did notice on the way home that they have a location in the airport and when I'm back in Phoenix I'll stop by just for the limeade.

Overall though, it's a nice place to hang out and get work done on your computer while enjoying good food."}
{"text":"I would say its OK. My boyfriend loves it! He would give it 5 stars. He loves the breakfast. He says its consistent. He loves the wifi and he loves the ice tea. The staff is wonderful! My issue is I cant eat at the same place over and over. However he can. I would say depending on what you order, they can be high priced. But none of these places, Paradise included can compare to Panera Bread! That is a 5 plus stars."}
{"text":"First time I went to Wildflower I was with my friend Jarrett.  It was me, Jarrett, and her 1yr old son T.    LOVE LOVE LOVED Wildflower from the moment we got our grub.  I've been back quite a few times.  And have gotten take out for J and myself for dinner.   

His opinion - \"It's alright.  A bit overpriced, but the sandwiches are okay.  They need to tone down the weirdness of their ingredient combos and that slaw crap they give you is just atrocious.\"  LOL 


Potato Cream Cheese soup - YUM!  So Yum in fact that on my first visit, T ate a good portion of my soup.  Kid tested recipe!  :)  

Emerald Spinach salad - Very tasty!!!
spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette 

Their bread is almost a little too crusty for me, but its still good.  

Friendly staff.  Speedy service!  Even when you place your order to-go upon arrival.   

We'll have to go there to try breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax, enjoy a nice hearty meal, and chat it up with family and friends.  

The place is clean and the customer service is great.  One guy went above and beyond to ask about some deserts we kept inquiring about that we ate at the Ultimate Yelp Event.

The food was fresh and cooked to order.  Their pesto chicken pasta was really good.  I could have ate that pasta for days.  The meatballs are good too.  You get a great portion of food for the price."}
{"text":"Really great food. This is a sandwich /soup chain. It's kinda of like Panera bread but less soupy and less starbucky.  They have excellent combos and their little pastry bar isn't too shabby.  Overall I can't find too much to complain about.  Good option for families or little Sunday brunch with friends."}
{"text":"We are from Southern California and visited Scottsdale for 2 weeks.  Every time we are in AZ we eat at Wildflower because it is one of my favorite quick stops for good food and healthy options.  We ordered dinner, I had the Superfood Salad, and my husband had a turkey sandwich. The food came quickly and was delicious as always. During dinner we decided that we would get dessert on the way out, but after we finished it was 8:10 and the restaurant had already closed. We asked if we could still get dessert and we were told by the cashier that the register was already closed. Frank came over and not only offered us dessert by because the register was closed he said we could pay for them the next time we came in. We had cash so we were able to pay but were impressed by his awesome customer service and professionalism. The only downside of every visit to Wildflower, is that there aren't any in CA and we have to wait until the next time we are in AZ. Maybe some day hopefully they will expand to our area!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Wildflower for years, consistently good breakfasts and sandwiches, nice atmosphere etc. Today's breakfast at the Chandler Mall location was a disappointment. Sunday morning you expect them to be in top form not dirty silverware and filthy bathrooms. It seemed like we had just let Saturday slop over into Sunday. The experience was an appetite killer for sure."}
{"text":"I'm leaving feeling very disappointed. I will say the food itself is very good but I had a few issues with the menu and food prep. Because it was my first time here I wanted to get an overall feel for their breakfast. They were unable to substitute pancakes for toast even at an up charge. This left my bill at $16 just for some pancakes and an egg breakfast. The toast is served buttered so they came out sopping and soggy. There was also a huge line of customers waiting to be helped and only one person working the register. Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, well prepared and yummy. Staff is genuinely friendly, service is pretty fast even during busy lunch hour. Nice environment for sit down. And they have a good organized system! Beats Paradise Bakery/Panera hands down. Skip the fast food and eat healthy at this location!"}
{"text":"Good food!  They definitely specialize in their baked goods.  Pretzels, scones, breads are much better than their actual meals or plates."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Just don't come on a weekday at 12, lines could be at the door. Overall I really like this place and the food usually comes out quick and good. The best sandwich there is the sweet potato! Yum!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this delicious bakery for years! Everything is fresh and made every day. The salads to the pastas.. Everything is delicious! The bread bowl with cheesy potato soup is a must. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am always satisfied with the variety of soups, sandwiches and salads. Today we had breakfast. We had the French toast that my granddaughters at without syrup. The fruit salad was good and the banana bread that came with it was fantastic. The lemon riccotta pancakes were hardy and delicious. 

We enjoyed the beautiful weather on the patio and the birds were entertaining the kids."}
{"text":"I wish this eatery was much closer because it is so gooood! It really does make Paradise Bakery look like an amateur! Well balanced and creative breakfast dishes make me get up and drive way too far for my ever pain in the ass stomach!

Lunch is good too, although I cant remember what I had. Oh, yes it was asparagus soup! The bread is amazing dunked into any of their homemade concoctions. Makes me all warm and fuzzy inside! 

Great spot for a business lunch apparently. The last time I was there, it was full of patrons pouring over their paper documents and laptops keys ticking away. I felt a little left out, but Kaleb and I had our own business to attend to.........filling the belly!"}
{"text":"dear wildflower,

okay, i forgive you.  we can be friends again.  now that i KNOW that you can get a half sandwich & soup, i did...and it was pretty tasty.  garlic tomato soup and the chicken salad...nothing amazing, but decent.  the reason you get another star was the service this time.  dude behind the counter was awesome, you should give him a raise, wildflower!  he got me samples of the soup and was super patient waiting for me to puzzle thru my complicated monkey mind to decide what sounded good.  a word of advice, you should put more salads on your menu for the \"wildflower two\" option.  three salads is not enuf to pick from, ESPECIALLY when one is a caesar!  anyway, like i said, i forgive you.  but, srsly, don't call or text every day...we aren't that kind of friend.  if i see you, i see you.  and, srsly, don't piss me off again...i don't want to have to egg you.

bisdan,
ally"}
{"text":"Amazing!  A salmon salad with pesto vinagrette dressing.  I am so sick of nothing but dry chicken breast on every salad I order out.  This dressing is tangy, basily, garlicky, and a tiny zip.  The one thing it isnt is sicky sweet.  Loved it.  Oh, and staff and manager are super nice too.  Did I mention the huge slab of amazing sour dough that came with it?  You wont be sorry."}
{"text":"There was a super long line and once we were finally next in line, all the cashiers except one that was already helping a family left so we had to wait an extra ten minutes than we would have if they hadn't left. When the manager finally came over to help us, he was extremely rude and didn't seem to listen at all. The orders were miraculously all correct, but the service ruined the entire experience."}
{"text":"Was hungry for soup and sandwich and we found this quant little place.  They make healthy great tasting food...  can't wait to come back!  Frank was great explaining their homemade breads and didn't rush as we came in 1/2 hour before closing."}
{"text":"We visited Tempe this week dropping our son off at ASU.  A friend recommended we try this place for lunch.  It was not too far from our hotel.  

I loved this place!  It was nice to go to a restaurant away from the busy ASU campus area.  It was the first restaurant meal that we had that tasted like home cooking, and fantastic home cooking at that!  I had the Almond tuna sandwich and split pea soup.  It was delightful and I would go back again in a heartbeat whenever we are in that part of the world.  

Try the blackberry orange lemonade: so refreshing on a hot Arizona day.

Oh the service was very nice.  Everyone we interacted with was extremely courteous and friendly.  We also ended up purchasing a gift card to send to some of our local friends down in AZ."}
{"text":"So I missed my connecting flight to LA and this was the only place still serving food! Someone at the taco place recommended them \"their food is better and they are still serving\" they said, and I listened :)

The staff was fast and friendly, my order (wig special instruction) was executed perfectly. I hung out for an hour using up my entire $12 voucher from American Airlines. Maybe missing my flight wasn't so bad? There's a counter top with plugs and USB for charging (lots of plugs actually).

Finally, the food was awesome... healthy and pretty cheap too. I like how healthy it is (except the deserts). The menu is large, don't judge it by what's in the display case only, there is so much more :D"}
{"text":"I love this place.  What a great healthy breakfast at great prices?  I get the egg breakfast for a little over $5.  This is a comes with potatoes, toast, and two eggs.  Simple but delicious."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre.

The pastries and breads are excellent! 

The menu has changed and i miss the omelette a they made before. 

Their home fries are soggy and stale. Tastes like they were made a week ago."}
{"text":"Did not expect to be wowed!!! Breakfast was amazing!! Real sausage links with over easy eggs and fresh red potoato's.  Best deal in town!"}
{"text":"Also great service and the food it amazing. Love to see a kids meal that is an actual good amount of food. They are kind of pricy as far as their salads and sandwiches go. But they have really delicious omelettes that are worth every penny. Also they have everything you need to make a great iced coffee"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Seriously. 
We stopped by here for a nice snack, and we ended up having a darned fine meal. I had a hot sandwich+soup, and my girlfriend had a special chicken salad sandwich. Both were excellent. And keep in mind, I'm not really a 'sandwich guy', but these actually made me want to pick up stuff at the store to make them more often. The soup was awesome- it was a pumpkin soup with small piece of pumpkin in it, delicious, warm, and earthy.
While we were sitting down, one of the people who worked there made it a point to stop by and ask if we needed anything. As it just so happens, we had our eyes on a piece of lemon pie, so we mentioned that to him. He told us that he'd take care of it, vanished, and almost instantly appeared with it back in his hands. I gave him so cash, and he returned just as quickly with a receipt and my change.
A few minutes later, someone else stopped by to check on us. I'll be honest, I was pretty impressed with everyone's friendliness and with the quality of the food. I would never really consider coming to a place like this- like I said, I'm not a 'sandwich guy', but after two visits here making such an impact, I'm thinking that it'll have to become a regular stop. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I'm hoping this is the correct place! I went to the restaurant across from the train park and Frank, the manager, was wonderful! I am from a different state and had my two grandsons with me. He made sure we had everything we needed!"}
{"text":"I hate any and all other corporate sandwich places that compete with this place.  I won't name names.  

This place is better overall by comparison. I love the sweet potato sandwich and the salad that I got with it.  It didn't seem like it was sitting in the back for a week before serving.  Plus, it was something more than iceberg lettuce, which was a plus. 

They are friendly and go out of their wait to fix any issues. (This was based on witnessing a manager handling a pain in the ass customer while i was there)."}
{"text":"As much as I dislike chain restaurants, the Maple Harvest Super Greens is the best salad I ever have eaten. Well worth the 830 calories and $10."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for some quality sandwiches. I tried the blt and it was pretty good. My friend wanted to purchase a cookie but the size of the dessert is so big. So the worker gave us a kid size cookie for free!! 

This place is located near gate B & Smash burger before security check."}
{"text":"I host a knitting group here every Tuesday evening, and we've been coming here for at least 5 years.  Overall, the food choices have been very good, tasty, and full of variety.  Obviously, there's been a few glitches over the years, such as special requests not happening (one lady does not want red pepper!), or something we've wanted has run out.  The food is flavorful and the staff has been very accomodating to our group!  The managers, although there has been some turnover, have always been kind and helpful.  A couple long-term members of staff are always friendly and can anticipate what we want!  Our only complaint, as a group, are the soup choices!  It seems, on Tuesdays, we get the \"leftovers\" or the not-so-popular soup items.  We would LOVE to see Pumpkin soup, the Lobster bisque, or the Roasted Tomato Garlic on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this late night dining experience in the Phoenix airport.  Greeted immediately as I entered the area and the young man (with an awesome fro) that was working the register was all smiles and very welcoming.  Very nice at this time of night (well at any time really).  The Ultimate Grilled Cheese was pretty good - so good that I scarfed it down before remembering to take a photo for this review.  You'll have to trust me on this one.  Everyone here has a smile. I love that!  And there's a nice bank of seating that includes power outlets.  What more could one ask for in an airport eating establishment?  Nothing!"}
{"text":"Great and really friendly service! The food is always good, but I was really impressed by the level of customer service by both of the gentlemen working this morning (3/13) being at the airport first thing in the morning isn't always the greatest but with happy people to greet you it makes batter"}
{"text":"They have the best food and it is also super healthy!! They by far have the best potato cream cheese soup I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I really have never been disappointed with this place. I've been to a few locations and I'm always impressed with the quality, customer service and flavors of the food. I didn't even want a dessert after today's visit because my belly was just so happy with my meal.

Today I went for the sweet potato sandwich and half spicy Indonesian veggie soup and it was PERFECT. I loved every single bite.

We had such wonderful customer service (and coming from me-- someone who prefers to be left alone-- that's saying something), specifically from someone named John. 

There is a courtesy phone by the bathroom, complimentary small lotions in the bathroom and bread samples near the drinks. It's really just all the extras and then some. 

I'd say my only fix would be to offer a few more of the sandwiches (grilled cheese) and salads (strawberry) as the half and half combo options. But really, I love it all.

My mom insists on coming here (and leaving with at least a pretzel or dessert on the way out the door in addition to more amazing iced tea!) every time she is in town and I have no problem delivering on that promise because we're all happy.

Fun fact: This location is the first one ever!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  The menu is fantastic.  They actually have steel cut oatmeal!  Wildflower Bread Company is following the same line as Panera Bread, Paradise Bakery and Atlanta Bread Company, but better, exponentially better.  They have the best soups!  I love the Portabello Mushroom and Tomato Basil Soup.  The salads are fresh, crisp and have an abundance of veggies.  One big plus is the salads are not overpowered with dressing.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. Today I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and was given what I can only describe as a child's size order of three small thin pancakes. This is very disappointing. The server said they changed their size on pancakes. I paid the same amount for less food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The absolute best customer service.  A server /floor person Cody was amazing.  He was very in tune to customers and their needs.

In my 30 years in business - probably some of the best service.  He would make a great manager / trainer."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting WBC and a few of my coworkers went here for lunch today. My first time I was about 95% pleased with my meal, realizing that I just didn't like what I got. This time I had the chicken parmesan which was delicious. Perfectly seasoned, perfect serving, it was bomb. I'll def be back"}
{"text":"Finally got to WFBC after the Yelp in Bloom event today. 

Two of the three of us had never been there, so we were a little shocked to see that it was POPPIN'. Probably didn't help that we were there during the lunch rush (1pm), but whatever.

 We went inside, the place is really nice. The front is a little disorganized, not knowing where the line ended and when people were just waiting to get a drink, but we managed our way to the counter. 

We all ordered the braised beef sandwich (lots of variety in our group). If I hadn't had the sample of that, I'm not sure what I would have ordered since everything sounds so good. I got the blackberry orange lemonade (BOMB!) and we scurried to find an open table somewhere. 

After finding out that the color and bakery item on your tag tells the staff  who gets what, we all got our sandwiches and dug in. I have to say that I HATE worcheschtirewhatever sauce, so I quickly avoided that and used up the au juis. I have to say it was pretty fantastic, plus, though it didn't look like a lot of food, it was very filling. 

I would 100% come here again and try out something new. Plus their pastries looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I had two really good meals at Wildflower Bread while visiting Arizona over the past few days, one in Scottsdale and one in Sedona. So when I saw Wildflower at the Phoenix airport I thought it was a no brainier to pick Wildflower over the other airport restaurants. Wrong. I had the \"Ultimate Grilled Cheese\" - unfortunately it had an undetectable amount of cheese. I mean almost no cheese whatsoever. No cheese = little flavor, it was actually quite dry, especially around the edges. There was some cheese in the middle - not much - but literally no cheese at the edges."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I have been coming here for about a year now off and on and every time I come in the employees always give me a warm welcome and provide quick service.  Cassandra knows the menu well so be sure to ask for her if your curious about trying something new"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite during a layover and it was spectacular. Ordered the spicy Cuban sandwich and it was tasty. I was working on my computer while waiting so I might have lost track of time but it didn't seem like I was waiting too long. The team member that brought out my sandwich apologized for the wait and offered me a cup of soup. 

It was an awesome gesture and he was so sincere. I read other reviews talking about awesome service and he definitely lived up to. 

Thanks for the great sandwich amazing service... And the soup!"}
{"text":"Roast beef and Gorgonzola sandwich was okay... Hard to mess up. The soup I had and the soup my friend had were both cold and gross."}
{"text":"My second time here and it's been Just as great as the first. I'm currently waiting on my food right now sipping on an amazing BlackBerry Orange lemonade, but the service tonight was amazing. It was close to their closing time but Mike was fantastic and they gladly took my order. Fantastic service goes a long way. 

I don't give 5 star reviews. Ever. But the service tonight put me over the edge. Last time I had the butternut squash ravioli - oh man it's unreal how great it tasted. The food, the service, all of it was 100% on point both times I've been here. 

Congrats Wildflower on my first 5 star! You earned it!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience and delicious food. This was my first time I had ever been and I was not disappointed-actually very impressed! The food was delivered fresh and quickly. What made the world of difference was Itzel, she took the time to explain the menu and even offer samples. Thank you for the great customer service, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches for great value. Spacious seating for our daughter. Perfect lunch spot after visiting the railroad park!"}
{"text":"The counter service staff is always friendly and helpful.  Love, love, love the breakfast here. My mom and I stop here before church on Sundays and the service and food is always spot on!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by because of my layover. They have breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, and yummy drinks here. I ordered a turkey BLT sandwich which has chipotle and avocado on Challah bread. It is really flavorful and fresh. I also ordered a Georgia peach frozen drink and its really good. It includes lavender in it and you can really taste it. The staff was also friendly and knowledgeable. A plus side to this place is that they have bars with outlets to charge your electronics. All in all, I hope I get a layover near the A gates next time when I'm in PHX so I can stop by here!"}
{"text":"I've visited several Wildflowers -- all good but like this one best! To be honest, I only have gone for breakfast (typically their awesome blueberry muffins & delicious coffee). Service is excellent thanks to Manager Tony, \"Chessie\"(?), Lori, Stacey, and others whose names I didn't get. But special praise for Sydney (with the \"purple hair\" as one happy customer noted) along with Evan, whose keeping everything neat & clean while enthusiastically greeting & entertaining patrons is a BIG asset to this fine company (as another customer commented). Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Everything you can possibly order is good here. I love the egg breakfasts, my fiancé loves the pancakes.  The bread is amazing, if you're into the high-gluten flour types of bread. Which I am :) I pre-ordered dinner rolls for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit.

I like to just sit here and read, work on the computer, and enjoy my time spent here and get a bunch of refills on coffee or iced tea. The iced tea is really good and comes in different flavors.

If you like Paradise more, you don't have good taste in food, and you like foods that actually DO taste pre-made. Sorry..."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were AMAZING.  Perfect for a weekend (or any day) breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I had an hour layover and didn't want to kill time sitting in a restaurant waiting for food. I came here instead since well, I can still eat somewhat healthy while at a layover. 

I got the tomato, mozzarella, and basil melt and it was delicious. The bread tasted pretty good for airport bread and didn't tasted like it sat out for days on end. Their chips came with interesting flavors and their smoothies were freshly made. 

I'd stop here again if I'm at this terminal for food. It's very convenient. They also had an area for you to sit and desserts behind the glass to get to go for the plane ride later."}
{"text":"Great experience. Friendly staff, great salads. Noah was especially attentive. A hard worker and courteous."}
{"text":"I'm a big, big fan of Wildflower. They are fast, fresh and delicious.

They have scrumptious bread, fresh salads and the soups are to die for. The BLT is my favorite,  thick bacon and \"always fresh\" avacado.

The Lobster Bisqe is the real deal with large chunks of meat in it. It's so good I eat it for breakfast. 

This particular location has a great patio when the weather allows and the pandora stations they play only slightly suck. Indoors each booth has power outlets and people are always busy working away. How cool is that. 

Yea it's corporate and a chain but lower your nose, it rocks. 

The ice tea is amazing, I always buy a bag to brew at home. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great . You order at the counter and they bring your food out. There is a nice big dining area and seating is almost always available.  
I have had the Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata for breakfast and they are generous with the brie, I've also tried the Banana Walnut Pancakes that were delicious. For lunch their Grilled Cheese and BLT rock. Dinner I have tried all the pasta but the Butternut Squash Ravioli
(butternut squash ravioli topped with roasted walnut cream sauce and nutmeg) is my favorite. They also have excellent ice tea and lemonaid and tons of pastries and sweets. 
This is a great place to go for a quick, fresh, sit down meal."}
{"text":"Super fast service & GREAT attitude for airport workers. The girl who served me was genuinely interested in how my day was going. Very pleasant experience and the food was good too! Thank you for making my layover better."}
{"text":"I originally had given this place a 2 star rating. We weren't happy with the prices, service, and weren't blown away by the food...  However, I received an email from the owner that DID blow my mind.  That was service and a guarantee beyond anything I've seen before.  I will definitely go back again next spring when I'm in AZ and give Wildflower another shot.  Excellent customer service goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"Visited on 9/10/15:

The staff is always eager to help while you order your meal.  I have a food allergy, and I have some diet restrictions so they check their book for ingredients before punching in my order.  I love their lemon bars.  If dining in, they will serve you your meal and clean it away.  Check the soup of the day before going because they change daily.  This place is clean, organized well, and right across from Dana Park.  I don't like the parking because I feel there aren't enough spaces for this restaurant and the little shops along the plaza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We love their sandwiches. This place reminds us of Panera Bread in the Midwest, except they are so much more fresh and unique. This place is a must try if you live in the
Valley."}
{"text":"Frank the manager helped me with a special bread request and was super hospitable.  I've always enjoyed the staff there; the Seville location is the only one I have been to.  For years, I used to eat at Wildflower monthly for Board meetings in their conference room and I always looked forward to the salmon salad with green goddess dressing.  Wildflower is also my go-to place for soup.  I'm giving Wildflower five stars for the value.  OK, it's not La Tour d'Argent but the food and friendly atmosphere are fantastic for the price.  Great if you live here as I do or are on vacation.  I'd think it's a great location for kids being right across from the train park but also it has a relaxed family feel complete with a perfectly lovely patio so the family can be outdoors.  You have to try it at least once.  Oh, and the breads are seriously made and seriously good."}
{"text":"I had to update my review today, after going to Wildflower for my typical \"I'm in Chandler and I must get my Wildflower fix\" nosh.

Today, I was pleasantly surprised that when the counter person took my order she made sure to point out, and ask if a) capers were OK on my salmon dish, and b) if mushrooms were ok on my caesar salad.  The thing is, I've been coming here a long time, and have been with other coworkers who are surprised/shocked the caesar salad comes with mushrooms on top.  I think it's pretty damn cool that they are now, even though it's written clearly on the menu, for those folks who don't read item descriptions - giving customers a heads-up just in case.

Outstanding adjustment in the counter help (not that I ever minded mushrooms in my caesar ;-) )"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a busy Sunday morning. Because of the crowd, we were told our food would be a 20 minute wait. When the food arrived, my husband's entree was missing. The server advised us his entree had been missed, but she told us they were making it immediately and apologized for the oversight. 

When his meal arrived, they brought extra potatoes and credited the meal from our bill. Huge customer service kudos to the team."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back. Lunch was great and the food cooked by Ray and Manny was fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a seasonal sandwich called Spicy Chipotle Sandwich which had scrambled eggs, sausage, sundries tomatoes, feta, spinach, and chipotle sauce on a grilled brioche roll. Very delicious and kind of messy but would definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. I had the ham and Swiss sandwich with everything on it except he red onion. The Dijon mustard sauce is nice. I got the potato soup. The soup wasn't very hot and I noticed a gnat flying around so that put me off but otherwise it tasted great and was in a good location."}
{"text":"I find it annoying that a place called Wildflower has so few vegetarian options.
I had the pasta, it was okay. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We love Wildflower.  The food is good and healthy.  Nice options.  Bakery is great.  People are friendly and professional.  Wildflower is a  family owned business and they plan on staying that way."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here ever since they opened but the last few times I've been here they can't seem to get the eggs right.  I'm kinda picky and I don't like any brown on my eggs. I've stopped ordering them. Everything else is great !!!"}
{"text":"Everything here was great. Was greeted when I walked through the door by employees at the register, was given suggestions when asked for them. Food runners were nice and courteous, getting an extra set of utensils for me when I asked for them. Manager or supervisor even came over and checked to make sure everything was OK and I didn't need anything else. Only reason for 4 stars is that prices were a little expensive for the coffee considering it was lukewarm coming out, but I was too short on time to have them make a fresh brew."}
{"text":"Omg so I just have to say I have never had Wildflower Bread Company but after going to the Chandler Fashion Center to what seemed like the millionth time and always wanting to go in, I finally decided to give it a try tonight . I am a VERY picky person and will not eat just anything and to top it off I am a vegetarian. I was overjoyed by the plethora of options offered at this beautiful restaurant and luckily the young lady at the front Angelina was extremely kind and super patient with me and my friend as we attempted placed our order. After a short minute of explaining to her our dietary limitations she quickly offered the (to my surprise) vegan option of the day which was the vegan spicy Indonesian vegetable soup. We were SUPER happy with the soup and are so excited to go back to try breakfast next weekend which Angelina also suggested we give a try. Thank you so much !"}
{"text":"Chopped Salad Rocks!  Love the way it's plated up with all ingredients lined up in rows, dressing on side to add as much as you want and the awesome bread on the side too!!  The sausage and egg sandwhich in the morning is also perfect brunch fare."}
{"text":"You need to come to Austin Tx. Nothing like this there. Fastest growing big city in U.S. Still lots of hippies.

{"text":"The food was good on several previous visits, but I am never returning to this restaurant or any others in the chain. Why? 

Food preparers in the kitchen botched my simple sandwich not once but twice. Why is that? They (two separate individuals!) were playing with a cell phone and showing each other and a third person pictures on it. 

Yes, playing with a dirty cell phone using the same hands they were preparing my food with. Playing with it while they prepared the food. The same cell phone they probably use in the bathroom and God only knows where else, covered in germs (how often does anyone clean their phone, really???). I brought this to the attention of the manager and he informed me that he'd already spoken to a different employee regarding the same issue, so apparently it happens often there. Can you say gross? 

I'm sorry, but that is absolutely and utterly disgusting. How can you betray your customers' trust like that, right in front of them, and play with your dirty, unsanitary phone while you make their sandwiches (wrongly to boot, since you're not paying attention?). I don't know what is worse, that multiple employees do this or that the management didn't seem to think it was an issue.

I'm super disappointed because I liked the food, very much in fact, but I will not risk my own or my family's health to eat someplace where basic sanitation is not a serious concern in the kitchen. Perhaps I should feel lucky that I didn't get sick previously? I don't know. 

I wrote to the owners of the restaurant to let them know what happened and that I won't be back until these individuals are no longer working there. There should be zero tolerance when food safety is concerned and obviously that is not the case at this location. Simply disgusting.

I hope it was a freak thing and not a regular issue over there, as management has since assured me, but one can never say. That I didn't notice it happening before doesn't mean it didn't happen before, but that argument works both ways. After speaking with the owner directly, I'm considering returning at a later date to give them another chance and will amend my review accordingly at that time. Fingers crossed for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the soups and salads are especially yummy. You can't go wrong with fresh made bread !! The staff are super friendly and even if there is a line you move thru very fast.....this is making me hungry, I think I will go there for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"Went in today to grab a quick lunch, ordered the Caesar salad after waiting 25 minutes I finally got the salad, took one bite and noticed the lettuce was brown and old, YUCK! I told someone and she gave me my money back but left hungry!! I will stick with the scotts. location they are always consistently good and fast."}
{"text":"Food is good. Chicken, pesto and feta sandwich very good, but wish they would leave off the tomatoes if they are not going to use ripe ones. Very noisy and crowded. Staff very helpful. They did not have things that were on the website which was very annoying"}
{"text":"I love the Wild Flower Salad!  It is perfect!  The French toast is amazing and your kids will LOVE smearing syrup all over and no one will yell at you."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The place is out of the way, very LOUD and noisy.  The service not the fastest and the food is just ok.  I would go back again but not as a first choice."}
{"text":"My daughter loves to come here for the potato cream cheese soup. She loves it! I had the Super Food salad with chicken. Omg...delicious and super filling."}
{"text":"Sadly, I cannot increase the star rating of Wildflower even though I really tried to like it so much after being reached out to by the founder. He was so kind and provided wonderful customer service but the food is very mediocre.

I got the kale 12 veggie salad this time, and the girl taking my order said it was enough to feed 2-3 people. For this reason, I got it with added salmon for $12. The salmon was shredded and almost resembled canned salmon... Kind of turned me off. The salad portion was not at all as big as she said which was also disappointing. The salad overall was way too sweet because of all the caramelized veggies and I didn't enjoy it.

The thing that bugs me about wildflower is that its pseudo healthy... they like to give off that vibe but really, nothing about it is healthy. Their whole wheat bread isn't even 100% whole wheat which I can tell right away from the taste and the color. Anyway, I'm glad I gave it another chance, but I can't return or recommend."}
{"text":"I swore off wildflower many years ago after a tuna sammich gone wrong. Then, out of desperate hunger, and the need to not be near so many people, I stumbled into above listed location. Boy was I impressed. I had what is now known as the Salmon Alfredo (formerly the smoked salmon Alfredo). God damn delish, albeit a bit to much to wolf down in one sitting. The more updated dish incorporates fresh grilled salmon (outta the ocean? I dunno and there are grill marks on the meat) instead of the prepackaged smoke salmon (which I thought was very good, but obviously not fresh) over fettuccine/linguine in a very fresh white sauce. Inter-dispersed throughout the dish are sun dried tomatoes and capers, one lending a sweet tang the other like crisp, squirty little nuggets of salty goodness. Hmm.. that sounded a little gay... Oh and lets not forget the fresh Parm grated on top. Amazing. I like the toasted fresh Artisan bread too that comes with the meal, very tasty and good for sopping up sauce. 

And if you get the chance to have breakfast there, try the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. The first 3-4 times you have them you will be amazed! Specially with the blueberry compote and fresh whipped butter. :) I have to say I'm getting bit tired of them and am looking forward to something new on their breakfast menu :)"}
{"text":"I go through a lot of East Coast food withdrawal here.
I miss NJ food..big time.
There are some things in NJ that are fairly impossible to find here in AZ-so I depend a lot on my friends back home to send me stuff.
One of those regional goodies is called Taylor Ham-It's a NJ thing. I can't explain it..it just rocks-the official name is pork roll I believe.

Well, wildflower makes a taylor ham sandwich. I  almost died from the happiness I experienced. I saw it on the menu, and I cheered wondering if it could possibly be my beloved taylor ham from NJ.
It is..I dont know why they sell it, or how they found out about it, or what genius decided this would do well, but I am not an avid fanof Wildflower from now on, and hope it never ever leaves the menu.

This location is an ok size-The iced coffee is TERRIBLE. Beyond awful.
It had a very artificial after taste. blech!
Service was nice..a lot like Paradise Bakery. 

Plenty of high chairs for parents but not sure if there are changing tables in the bathroom. I'll have to check that out next time I go in."}
{"text":"My husband's father was traveling with no money. We called to pay over the phone for him to get some food.   Laura and her team were amazing and offered to make him a meal on their own. Best team ever that works there. Very impressed with their good hearts!"}
{"text":"Love this new Wildflower. Great service, delicious food, adorable set up snd decor, and they have loco beer, wine, and kombucha on draft!!"}
{"text":"Daniel and Raul are such friendly people. I am so happy with my service. Such a positive environment to have a nice yummy lunch and amazing cookies here! Super satisfied!"}
{"text":"Awesome wildflower, remarkable team in the morning and at night! Great and helpful! I recommend it if you are in the lower A concourse, specially if you love healthy, local foods including sandwiches, unique soups and salads! What I really love getting for breakfast is the chipotle egg sandwich, love the house made chipotle sauce! Get the Ultimate Grilled Cheese for lunch 3 types of cheeses with arugula lettuce and roasted tomatoes, and of course the turkey blt plus, one word delish! Dining room is always nice with two tvs and room for charging your laptop and phones for that next flight! Definitely stop by for great food and great friendly service that makes you want to come back for more! An unique airport experience, but if you are used to the local outside wildflower you'll still have all your favorite pastries and coffee drinks but just a smaller condensed menu for the grab, order and go type of feel."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, always something for everybody on the menu. Soup, salad, pasta or just dessert & coffee. 

Soups change daily.. Served by the cup, bowl or bread bowl.. Yum

Try the passion fruit ice tea or the blood orange limeade. 

Parking at this location at lunchtime can be tricky, but worth the walk."}

The food came out very quickly with very friendly staff. I ate the sandwich first which was just ok not a sandwich id buy again but the soup was phenominal id definitly buy the soup again. They also offer a butternut squash ravioli that i would love to try and will review on once i try it. Other than that the place was nice, open, clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get the chicken lemon vegetable soup for over a month now! I've called in as early as 11am on Wednesday so I can pick it up on my lunch break and every time they are out! 
Prepare better!!!! Get more of this soup if you know it sells out quickly!
This is the most annoying thing ever."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain restaurant. In the same vain as Paradise, but I think the choices at Paradise are a bit more deep."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Wildflower Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants due to the quality and quantity of food I get for the price."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they have high ratings. The cold sandwiches are pre made, the bread was soggy."}
{"text":"I got the name of the person who made my sandwich it's Jamie I love the tuna sandwich and wedding soup such delicious fresh food and the waitstaff is just lovely presentation is delightful thank you for me making my stay great!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  

Wildflower is my go-to place for lunch in the area.  They have a huge selection of great sandwiches and salads and the portions are huge.  My favorite salad is the chopped salad, rivals all others that I've had.  The only thing that would make it better is if the salads had the option to have sliced avocado on it (you can add avocado, but it's the avocado that's already mashed up and used as a sandwich spread.) 

They have great breakfast too!  

The Scottsdale location is great - big, lots of booths, and a large outdoor seating area.  It is much more relaxed than some of the other locations and they have great service.  Every time I have been there, there is a good amount of seating available."}
{"text":"Wow, i just want to keep updating my review for here all the time. Everytime i have an average or a so so experience when I eat out somewhere else, I always say to my husband, \"should've gone to wildflower\". Such are our feelings about this place. I have never left this place feeling like i shouldn't have come here or i had a an average or bad experience. Never. I mean this place has such a nice vibe to it."}
{"text":"Who knew you could get healthy food in the airport? I had the quinoa salad with chicken, which was great. So many veggies! Service was great too."}
{"text":"A great sandwich and salad place.   Our favorite is to share the Emerald Spinach salad and Beef/Gorgonzola sandwich, but everything else we have tried has always been good.  We don't lunch out offen but make a point of it when I start craving the fresh tasty offerings of Wildflower."}
{"text":"Good soups, salads, and sandwiches. Not a fan of the pancakes or baked goods. However, the bread is so good, it's still one my local faves for a quick dinner of breakfast."}

{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The service is wonderful! Michael the manager was so nice and kind he gave great recommendations and ensured we would love our food! Alyssa and Ashton were so kind up at registers they welcomed us the second we came through the door! It's was just a great experience! Definitely coming back!! 10/10"}
{"text":"I went here after a trip to Chelsea's Kitchen was unsuccessful, and I'm glad I did. Not only did I save about $20, but the service was good (friendly employees), and the food was tasty. I ordered the vegetable quinoa salad with no feta, and would gladly order it again. Served with a large piece of fresh sourdough for $10, you can't go wrong. And it's filling!"}
{"text":"I regularly pick up orders from this restaurant for Door Dash and I just had to try it. The staff is so friendly and the food looks and smells so good. So tonight, my sister-in-law and I wanted to satisfy our sweet tooth so we thought we would try out Wildflower. It was busy as usual but the staff was still friendly and Jessica Gomez in particular took the time to describe the different pastries to us and recommend some tasty treats. She made us feel important and was so nice. Come to think of it, every time I have picked up an order, she has always been so pleasant. Anyway, we ordered way too many sweets but we enjoyed them and especially the chocolate chip scone. My SIL tried the potato soup and it did not disappoint. We will definitely be back to try other items. Such a nice little joint to enjoy a treat. See Jessica, she is so sweet!"}
{"text":"Food is great...service on the other hand no so much. Lately every time I come in to this location I swear they forget about me and it's always when I have to be here.  Over 25 min waiting for my food until I finally said something. Shame that it is close to my work but won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My kids love the mini chocolate chip pancakes here. I enjoy a soy latté. A stop at Changing Hands before leaving = a pretty good day!"}
{"text":"The bread was so hard I couldn't cut the top layer without causing the meatballs to go to the side and when I cut the top and moved on to the bottom layer it couldn't be cut so I had to pick it up and bite it and the meatballs were hard and greasy with an awful flavor"}
{"text":"Just had the new roasted butternut squash salad. It was absolutely amazing, a perfect combination of sweet and spicy! I've been coming here for many years and the new season items are always delicious! Manager and staff are always profession, nice, and courteous!"}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 for me. Had the chicken pesto and it came on ciabatta bread that took a chain saw to eat. Will try it again next time and sub different breAd. Very loud at this location. Loved the free wifi. Quality food."}
{"text":"Eh. I'm giving Wildflower a 3 star because I was really underwhelmed at the breakfast food here. It was relatively bland and overpriced. The bread was good, but the eggs and potatoes were not. 

I tried the pumpkin Carmel latte and it was probably the worst tasting thing I ever had. 

I have eaten here one time prior and had a pasta dish that was really good, so maybe it's just the breakfast items. 

Service is fine and the food came out pretty quick. Good location."}
{"text":"let me simply start off by this place is way better then paradise bakery. The food portions are great along with the quality. I ordered the turkey pastrami, and it was delicious. Even though it looked packed, i quickly ordered my food, and the wait was just right. The service, the atmosphere was just right. I have no negative comments about this place. I will return to try other things on their menu, and im looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I eat at this place for lunch about once a week. I love their soups especially, but really everything is pretty good. They also have a good flavored, unsweetened iced tea that I really like. Other nice touches include the personal sized lotions for guests in the bathrooms. The staff are typically helpful, although sometimes service can be a little slow due to the lunch rush that overtakes the restaurant mid-week around noon. We try to get there closer to 11am to avoid the crowd and hopefully get a seat in the dining area. Those who dare to arrive at noon are forced to hover like vultures over the tables in hopes someone will leave so they can snatch the seat. I recommend coming a little off the normal lunch peak to avoid such craziness, but otherwise thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"you have got to try their mango frozen lemonade.

their carrot cake and ham and cheese grilled sandwich are sooo good!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 4.5 years now, I've tried nearly everything on the menu and is all phenomenal!  Everyone on their staff is always super friendly, of course most one them know me cause I manage to come in at least once a week.  :) there have been times when I've eaten here everyday for a week!  Their menu is always changing with the seasons, they have a bread of the month, and they have a rotating soup schedule.  Right now my favorite things from the menu are: the egg breakfast,  veggie frittata,  vegetarian ginger carrot soup, chopped salad,  and their sundried tomato and garlic bread which is a limited bread for the month of August. Come here and you will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the \"WBC\" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I don't feel like cooking and I want something on the healthy spectrum. I usually visit for dinner after a workout at Orangetheory (which is conveniently located in the same plaza). I usually get a BLT plus or chopped salad. In the winter months their soup is a great choice as well. They have a rotating soup menu so the flavors never get boring. You can also choose half soup, salad or sandwich combo if you can't decide what you want. They have a large bakery selection as well, from pastries and fresh bread. I have not had one of their pastries, but am always tempted. They also have a large selection of breakfast foods and beverages. The service is usually excellent, quick, and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a decent neighborhood eatery with average salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, and baked goods. Some things are delicious and some things aren't good at all, it is kind of hit or miss. When Wildflower first opened it was clean and inviting, but it has gone downhill recently. The staff is always very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate your needs, and the food comes out quickly. They have different soups on different days, so check online before you go if soup is what you are craving. I am a French onion soup connoisseur and was excited to see it on the menu...sadly it had no flavor, the cheese was not melted, and it just left me wanting to fulfill my craving elsewhere. However, they do have incredible cream and cheese based soups; the potato is great! Their sandwiches are average, but they do offer some unique hot subs that are worth trying. They even have a vegetarian option. The pastas are ok; really if you want pasta I suggest going somewhere where they make it fresh and don't just boil up a box of noodles. The salads are where they shine though. They have every topping you can think of, and an customize the salad based on what your preferences are. I have never been disappointed with a salad; it is always crisp and fresh, and the ingredients are creative as well. As for the baked goods I suggest the scones and breads, especially the chocolate chip scone! 

If you are looking for a quick and easy meal then this is a good place to go. Wildflower is also a good option for take out as well. The atmosphere is quiet and a good place to meet for lunch or even meet someone for a business meeting."}
{"text":"My go to go favorite lunch location when I don't have much time. Wildflower is delicious, great atmosphere, and quick. ."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The set up, the big portions and the chunks of bread they serve you! It is very neat! I had only good experiences so far at every location. Pasta recipes are very good! I always try something new when I stop by alone, with friends or family!"}
{"text":"I love EVERYTHING there and all the people I get to work with. Customer service is all in my name. Lol. I like making people happy and explore their opinions on our menu. 

The food is amazing and I like having my team make the meals that I want for dinner. I appreciate all their hard work!!! I work nights with Gio, Britney, Maya, Mayra, Adrea, Jayme, Patsy, Bruno, Jackie, Freddy, Tialia, Edgar, Ramon, Alexander, Alex V. They are great people to work with. We do our best to make OUR CUSTOMERS to have the best experience in joining our team as well as ours. 

I'm not a hashtag kind of gal, but #WildflowerBreadCompany. 

GO TEAM!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, always hot and fresh. Please don't lose the integrity of your food quality."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast during a road trip from CA. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and wonderful breads on display. The restaurant is very similar to the Corner Bakery franchise we have home, but I thought the food was a step above. My only problem was that I couldn't stop eating all of the delicious breads they provide with each of the meals we ordered. Great food, great atmosphere and the food was served promptly."}
{"text":"Dont get the BLT! All you get is LT. For a 10 dollar sandwich there should be more than 4 small scraps of bacon. I will never go back"}
{"text":"It's okay.  I really have nothing to recommend.  Except the bread.  The bread is always delicious, although quite expensive.  Who pays eight dollars for a loaf of sourdough?  Me, apparently."}
{"text":"This place is my \"old stand by,\" and somehow I end up here 1-2 times a week. I have tried maybe half of the menu by now, and I always gravitate to the Hummus Plate Salad.  It is so delicious. Vegetarian friendly, though I am a meat lover, and full of roasted veggies, hummus, perfect balsamic vinagrette and nine grain bread. Heaven on a plate :) And for under $10!!"}
{"text":"I normally go to the Biltmore location but yesterday I had a craving for them after my workout so I headed over to the Glendale store. I ordered a Kale salad and my normal go-to Chopped Salad...got home and my Kale salad had pieces of onions in it, I'm sure it was remnants from being prepared in the kitchen since the salad does not include onions normally. I have a onion allergy so I ended up tossing both salads (I bought one for today's lunch & dinner last night), maybe this was a slight error due to it being close to closing time last night (8:15) but I was deeply crushed I wasn't able to enjoy my salad after driving 10 or so miles out of my way to get it.

My experience with large catering orders from them for firm meetings at work has been nothing but great in the past, so I won't totally slam them, the food is high quality and great tasting, I just didn't have the best of luck with mine last night."}
{"text":"Favorite cafe in the area! The food always tastes home-made, fresh, and delicious. They have free WiFi and a cute atmosphere. Parking isn't an issue as this place is located in a complex with a parking lot. In the past, I have gotten the chicken pesto sandwich, wildflower chicken salad, and garlic tomato soup. They have great customer service too. There's also a display of delicious treats at the front of the store that you can try."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! Thank you to Jessica and Luca for being exceptional employees and putting love in your service. You started out my 16 hour workday on a great note, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Always a great lunch spot despite the entitled and rude swarm customer wise. The staff here have the patience of saints! Great iced tea, tuna salad, chicken salad and of course great bread."}
{"text":"I fought coming here for so long, it just didn't sound like my kind of place. Give me a juicy burger and greasy onion rings and I'm happy. One day after church I finally relented. What a pleasant surprise!

Grilled Cheese, wonderful. Tuna, scrumptious. But I keep coming back to the Chicken Pesto and Feta. I get it on rye instead of the ciabatta roll. My mouth is watering now just thinking of it. 

The soups are all very good. The Potato Cream Cheese soup and the French Onion soup top the list for me, depending on my mood. 

I love the Lemon Chicken Penne when I'm feeling pasta. Very flavorful, good portion. 

On your way out get a Shortbread Cookie. Mmm. I great way to finish off a wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"I'm going to go against the *grain* here and say that I hate this new artisan bread movement. I miss the days when bakeries made warm fresh soft bread composed mostly of butter and white flour. I blame Atkins and his \"fuck you, bread\" campaign... it's not like America is any less fat today for all his efforts. 

Wildflower is pretty much another one of those artisan bread bakeries... dry, stale tasting, and mostly crust. Given that, I'm not partial to their sandwiches. I thought I'd like their grilled cheese, but once I was done gnawing on my fried sea sponge oozing with oily cheddar, I realized I was wrong. If I could sum up their sandwiches in one word, that word would be \"dry\" - but I could easily think of a dozen others that would be suitable substitutes, and none of them are flattering. 

Aside from that, they have awesome salads and pasta and you can't really beat the price for what you get. I think they have good ingredients and for these reasons alone, this place would get 4 stars... they lose half a star (which is why I dropped them down to 3) because their tables are always filthy and covered with someone's dirty plates. 90% of the times I've been here, I've had to clear my own tables. 

Most people are huge fans of Wildflower and I do like it... I'd just rather eat at Pita Jungle if I'm in this area. It does make for a great alternative if Pita is packed. It's certainly cheaper and quicker."}
{"text":"I wanted to write and give a great review of Wildflower as a whole, the Seville location specifically and the manager, Frank. I am on the Board of Gift of Adoption - Arizona Chapter, and we recently asked Wildflower to donate food for a BBQ we were having at the Train Park across the street to raise money for grants to families adopting vulnerable children. They ended up donating all of our food (including dessert), plates, napkins, utensils, etc. Everyone raved about the food and we were able to raise more money for a good cause because of it. 

Frank and the other employees we worked with were so wonderful and so supportive, and since then we have even used the private conference room at the Seville location for our board meetings. Nothing but great things to say about Wildflower after our experience, and I already loved them even before that!"}
{"text":"Easily a place you return to again and again.  Bright, clean and always smells nice.  This was one of the first places I went to upon my move to AZ.   Great array of fresh baked breads (organic and gluten free) You can go breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I've tried the Chicken Pesto and Feta sandwhich on a cibatta roll, Chicken parmesean ( a little salty), and my favorite, butternut squash ravioli! Don't be fooled by the spaghetti and meatballs - disappointing! They give you weird meatballs on the side!  Other than that, a very classy lunch/dinner spot.  They have wi-fi and a really beautiful glass flower centerpiece that comes down from the ceiling.  Best part: The chocolate chip scone! Buy two or three!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in awhile  and decided to go for breakfast. I ordered the spicy Chipotle egg sandwich without the sausage. It was delicious. The eggs were done perfect and the spicy chipotle sauce was divine. It has sun dried tomatoes, feta and spinach as well. I loved it. My husband ordered the Sausage and egg sandwich and said it was alright. I let him try mine and he said he'd get it next time. The brioche roll is buttery and light. There is so much flavor it this sandwich. I have nothing but great things to say."}
{"text":"This is the spot to eat if your in the Phoenix airport.  Fresh food that taste good and pent receptacles for charging devices between flights. They were thinking about travelers when designed this. To keep the line moving. You order and they bring you you're food's.  Not bad deal since you will need a moment to grab a place to sit.

The staff on today work very well together. Lots of good choices on the slim menu. Definitely not over priced for airport foods. 

Stop on if your on a layover or when exiting and want a good sandwhich."}
{"text":"I walked away from this place and was doing a findmeGF search and turned back.  

So the chicken enchilada soup which was gluten and dairy free was great.    I also got their Asian chicken salad with the cilantro lime dressing, since the peanut was not GF. 

Food tasted great and the ladies up front were a blast to talk to.    Over by gate a9 definitely a good find."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food! My Dad's favorite spot! Fresh bread and ingredients make amazing salads, soups, and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We went here because we had a coupon and will now be regular customers! It's bright and cheery with lots of seating inside and out. Their good sized menu has a wide variety of choices from pastries, desserts and Mac and cheese as well as a ton of healthy options for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Our food was so good we made a point of telling the cooks (Manny and Ralphie). The restaurant staff (Taylor Z., Taylor F. and Jeffrey) were super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. 
Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Nancy was amazing she is so Friendly and helpful ! I love this location . Nancy was very welcoming and understanding I'm very difficult and picky and she gave me No attitude whatsoever and helped with all my indecisiveness:) 5 Stars!!  now that's customer service"}
{"text":"Logan greeted us and offered us samples of the soup.....yummy.  He was so cheerful and very helpful with all our questions.  The mushroom soup was excellent!  Thanks for the great service and warm welcome!"}
{"text":"We decided to go out for a lite dinner tonight and we remembered this place. My family really enjoys this place plus we were trying to find a place to eat that had some soft food for my son since he got his wisdom teeth out. We walked in and the place was very clean and welcoming. 
I ordered the Triple Club and was a little leary cause I'm not a real fan of nine grain bread but sandwich was really good. It was just booming with flavor. The Asian Salad was very good and my daughter had the chicken pesto sandwich with a Cesar salad. She loves the sandwich and declared the Cesar salad as the best she eaten. Then my son gobbled up the pesto chicken with linguini. So the food was very good as always. 
This place is becoming our favorite salad and sandwich place. Beats out Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place so we decided to try it. Very nice lunch spot. The spice meatball sandwich was really good. They give you 3 meatballs and the sandwich has a nice kick to it. My wife had the Chicken Continental. Very juicy, tender and a little kick to it with the honey mustard. 
The inside and the bathrooms were very clean but they had a lot of dirty tables. Good thing those dirty dishes weren't there when I walked in because it wasn't very appetizing. Other then the outside tables, this was a very nice lunch spot that we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Updated to 3 stars simply based off the great response I got from the founder of the company in response to my yelp review."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly place, like Panera. Love their bread selections. I also tried their berry pie that was a little too tart but perfect when you heat it up. The price was just right for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Quick Review: 4.4/5 Food Quality 5/5 Convenient, 4/5 Price

If you are searching for healthy food at a reasonable price in the airport, I recommend going to Wildflower.

I had my salad in 5 minutes.

The food is fresh and good"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place! Great food, great atmosphere, I have been going here since they opened and before they opened here I went to deer valley location for about 14years!! Never unhappy"}
{"text":"I would say a better Panera Bread.  Good lemonade, and soup and salad.  Pricey for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always good. Love the breakfast and breakfast sandwiches here. Also the lunches. Bread and bagels are always fresh and the scones ROCK!"}
{"text":"I came in here for breakfast.  I ordered the tomato and feta egg sandwich without the bread because I am gluten free.  I wasn't expecting such a large amount when I got it.  It was soooo good without the bread.  I highly recommend this and will order it again.  I also had coffee.  Their coffee is great!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich.  It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich.  I look forward to fall every year just to get this sandwich! Yummy"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but food is all premade and on par with gas station sandwiches. $25 for two was also crazy! We threw everything but the half soup out."}
{"text":"Why did I pay $13 for a small salad and bowl of soup from the \"pick two\" menu? I dunno, I thought it was supposed to be healthy and gourmet. Food was good, but more than I wanted to spend for lunch, I was hungry an hour later.

I noticed the floor attendant used the same towel to wipe down the booth seat, then used the same towel to wipe the table afterwards! That's unsanitary! Gross! It's like wiping dirty butt germs onto an eating surface! I think the Health Dept. requires two separate cleaning towels to be used?

The line moved quickly, the cashier was friendly. The food came out quickly. Parking was decent."}
{"text":"This place is always wonderful. I usually order the chicken pistachio pomegranate salad! It's wonderful every single time! Also split a piece of lemon coconut cake with friend...it was good, but would have been wonderful if would have been cold! (I got the food to go, so was room temp by the time we ate)"}
{"text":"The food was great, I haven't had an awesome meatballl sandwich in a long time, Cody was great and provided awesome service. :)"}
{"text":"Clean simple food, well priced, good choice, well priced, has seating, staff very courteous."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had higher expectations for this place, it wasn't bad though the sandwich I had was not so good but my sister ordered the pesto pasta and it was pretty tasty, maybe other things on the menu are good! And people that worked there didn't smile as much so idk..."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after a trip to the RR museum across the street. Orders were accurate and everybody seemed to be happy with their food. I enjoyed  my open faced chicken parm, but it could've done better with a little less kale. Also, they don't start serving pasta until 3 PM. As a archetypal Joe Pesci-type character might say: \"What the fuck is that shit?\""}
{"text":"Great healthy airport food. Very creative, I had a chicken quinoa salad! Upbeat staff."}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. They had amazing options to choose from and all of the choices did not disappoint. My kids were even very happy about their meals, which they can be the biggest critics!"}
{"text":"The South American coffee is very flavorful and tasty. Great place for a meal in the Scottsdale Airpark community. Try the protein breakfast bowl."}
{"text":"I have always gotten great customer service at this Wild Flower. The food quality and selection is so great! 

I placed a to go order last weekend. I wanted sandwich fixings in a salad form. The woman who took my order helped me and offered suggestions. I usually dread to go orders because they are always incorrect. My order was spot on! And so quick to pick up. Love this Wildflower location!"}
{"text":"My husband just moved to Scottsdale fromVirginia and we were looking for a quick, but good quality place for lunch... And this is it! Friendly staff, fresh food, and quick service. The hummus plate is huge.  My husband got the sweet potato sandwich with fig and fresh mozzarella... It was amazingly good (and great portion too). We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I came in to the store to get a birthday cake and had no idea which one to pick. The young dark haired lady at the pick up order register was so nice and helpful! A+ for service ( I wish i remembered her name). The lemon coconut cake packs a lot of flavor in a yet delicate and airy cake. I also got to try the breads, which are baked fresh in the store, and they are delicious as well. I need to come back to try their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer straight up: Wildflower sent me a gift card, which I used for this lunch. That creates some bias, but it also made me hyper-critical through the whole experience, as I did want to write a balanced review. 

It's the holiday season and the shopping center around Wildflower Bread was bustling. I wasn't surprised to find the restaurant's seating mostly full--which was fine, as I was doing take-out. I had two people ahead of me in line but only had to stand there for maybe a minute. I ordered a chicken pistachio pomegranate salad and a bear claw to go. I was given the bear claw right away. I stood back by the drink dispenser, as there was no seating, and to my shock I waited all of two minutes before I was called for my salad. Considering the busy-ness, that was really something.

I arrived home, famished. I rarely get take-out, in part because something is usually left out. I was happy to open my paper bag and find everything there. The two chunks of Vienna bread were just what artisan bread should be: a crust with tender toughness, with a chewy, perfect interior. 

The chicken pistachio salad itself had an odd mix that worked in a surprising way. I never would have paired kalamata olives with oranges, but it ends up with a sweet/sour dynamic. The onions were a little strong, but everything else was just right in flavor and texture: feta, mixed cabbage, chopped pistachios, very fresh and flavorful chicken, and a dressing that was of good sweetness.

I tried only a small piece of the bear claw--the rest was for my husband, who greatly enjoyed it with his coffee. This was one huge pastry! It's a meal unto itself.

This visit to Wildflower Bread Company reminds me that I should visit much more often. I can't really find anything bad to say about it, even when I try."}
{"text":"I needed a fast meal before attending an event at Changing Hands next door. I walked into Wildflower Bread Company at 11:30 on a Saturday. The place was packed, but there was no line at the counter. I had already scoped out the menu online and immediately ordered the chopped salad, and a chocolate chip cookie for my son. The cashier immediately offered us cups for water, too, which was appreciated. We were provided the cookie right away.

Then we had to find a place to sit. Yikes! There was one empty table in the whole place, but we snagged it. I was relieved that my food was out within five minutes. The salad is beautiful, and the dressing was quite good. 

The two bread pieces served along with it were HUGE--I wrapped one in napkins to eat later. I bake all my own bread and am something of a bread snob, so I can say with confidence that their artisan bread is absolutely delicious. It's the real deal.

Meanwhile, my son gobbled up his cookie. It was the size of a small saucer!

I was very pleased with this restaurant and I hope to visit their location that's much closer to where I live on the west side."}
{"text":"Great service 
The employe Brandon what excellent 
He knew exactly what he was doing 
Fast friendly would give a 10 if I could."}
{"text":"It has been far too long since I have updated you on my Wildflower. Yes, you heard me - MY WILDFLOWER! There are several Wildflower Bread Companies around the Valley of the Sun, and I've eaten in more than one . . . but none better than the one in my hood. Walking distance. Just a hop, skip and a jump from my front door.

I stop by on a fairly regular basis to try something new, or get one of my long-standing favorites. I have never, EVER been disappointed. They are always spot on with service & eats. 

A few days ago I took some visiting family here for breakfast. I was hoping that they would find it as scrumptious as I always do. We are an animated bunch, so I was hoping to get a word in edgewise so I could see if they truly liked Wildflower. Well, it was not difficult to ascertain . . . once our plates arrived we ate in silence. Oh, there was the occasional \"Please pass the pepper . . . ,\" but, for the most part, we all just shoveled in the breakfast goodies! 

No need to ask . . . everyone at the table gave Wildflower an outstanding Grade of \"A+\"."}
{"text":"Love the potato soup and blt.  Also have great breakfast sandwiches.  You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches and soups. It's a little over priced in the way I spend 15 dollars and I am hungry later. I have ate at much healthier cheaper places. However if I had to choose between say mickey d or here. I would go here. It's never a miss , but always a unreasonable hit on my pocket book."}
{"text":"Wednesday morning 9:00 am and music is annoyingly loud as if you were in a bar. Forget talking to each other. Ordered Grilled Ham and Egg Sandwich. I swear it was microwaved like a fast food place would.  Opened it up and there were three (3) tiny pieces of ham about the size of half of a dime. $ 6.99.  Turn the music down, serve fresh food. We're big fans of Tempe location and we're sad to experience such a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"The first time I tried WBC, it was at the Sedona Branch. The Arrowhead branch did not disappoint, either. The staff were as friendly as the Sedona branch. Of course, the food was delicious and the store was very clean. 

Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very impressed for airport food. I came through here on a layover and got a spicy chipotle egg sandwich (add bacon). It was very enjoyable. It wasn't as spicy as I would have hoped for but still had good flavor. If I ever layover here again, this will be where I eat"}
{"text":"I was originally introduced to Wildfower by a friend, and I have since brought other friends here.  They do not have a menu that is as extensive as some of their competitors, but they do have very comfortable seating, clean restrooms, and the food has been excellent (tasty, presented well, and hot) every time I have been there.  I personally love the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, the Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata, and the Chicken Continental (sandwich).  On a side note...  If you love glass art (like that of Dale Chihuly), be sure to check out the light fixtures.  :-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Wildflower chopped salad with grilled chicken when I came here during my trip to AZ. I love that Wildflower is a more health oriented, fresher version of Panera, which we have on the East coast (and I never go there). Service, ambiance and food were great, but I knocked off a star because there aren't that many gluten free options here, but the menu is somewhat labeled. I did check out their extensive allergen information online, but it was hard to compare the menu available, to what was online."}
{"text":"I really love coming here. I work at the mall and it's the closest and most convenient place to eat. I really enjoy the environment and the fast casual style. They have a really good menu, everything is different and unique and gives you an opportunity to try something new. The staff is super friendly, and are always checking up on you to make sure your meal is perfect. Love, love, love this location!"}
{"text":"Love love love!  This place blows paradise away.  Both kale salads are so delicious, fresh ingredients, the meat is all high quality!  The bread is fluffy.  I wish there was a location closer to our house and my office.  Highly recommend using Wildflower for catering and large parties.  We order food for 20 people and it went perfectly!  The staff was very helpful and went above and beyond."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite lunch spot in the neighborhood.  I always have great, cheerful, prompt service, the value of what you get for what you spend is incomparable, and I've yet to find anything on the menu that I don't like.  This place beats the hell out of Panera!"}
{"text":"This is a very tasty place. The best lemonade! And the salads are scrumptious.  They are very helpful - especially Frank, he wanted to make sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Fabulous and excited to have them open now and the food was no surprise to be great as well.  Wildflower has been one of our favorites for years and now to be even closer is just mind blowing.  The staff and other employees are just as friendly and professional as the other places and we love that consistency"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and the most impressive thing is the consistency with the food.  The turkey pastrami sandwich is to die for and really hard to share."}
{"text":"LOVE Wildflower. This place is way better than Panera/Paradise. I always get the chopped salad with chicken. It's the perfect lunchtime meal with a side of bread to make sure you feel extra comfortable the remainder of the afternoon. Service is always really great and personable."}

SITREP

Welcome to the beginning of my 7-HR layover in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, \"Yayyyy!\"

THE SETUP

Just got in from Miami airport, where I ALREADY had a 6-HR layover from 3:15pm to 9:30pm local Miami time.  Caught my connecting flight to Phoenix, and I'm off on a 4 HR trek westward across 2 time zones(?) where I got in around 11:30pm.  

When you do Economy class - via Travelocity - there are absolutely NO FRILLS whatsoever, except for a cup o' soda and a bag of pretzels. So by the time I crash through the gate with the rest of the disembarking passengers, I be very very hungry (but FIRST.MUST.PEE....)

CUTE LITTLE STORE FRONT

So when I gather my wits about me, find a WiFi enabled table in my nearby gate area, I take note of my surroundings and notice WILDFLOWER BREAD COMPANY, and saunter on over.

Now mind you, it's well past midnight at this point, I have 7 HRS until my flight to Sacramento leaves at 7AM, and I'm concerned about staying alive with nutritional substances....  But most places are closed.  In fact, I THINK Wildflower is technically closed to, or at least their kitchen is.

But the gent lents me know there are items in the fridge section (thank the gods) and I grab me an albacore tuna sandwich...

...and by Poseidon's beard it's deLISH!  Tuna, cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, all on a tasty sub bun.  *YUM!*

THE LOWDOWN

When you're desperate - and Wildflower is nearby - you MAY stay alive another 7 HRS, just sayin...."}
{"text":"I've lived 3 blocks away from here for the last 4 years and have never been in until today. What a pitiful mistake that has been. 

I came in for lunch, it was pretty packed and the parking lot gets rather full so just be prepared for that. 

Having never been in before I am sure I looked like a deer in headlights and immediately admitted I was overwhelmed. The girl who was helping was super patient and explained things to me and was insanely nice. I'd go back here just because of her. But also the guy on the other register was happy to help and gave great suggestions. I was checked on a few times after receiving my food just to make sure everything was good. They made me feel very welcomed. 

The food was excellent. I had some form of a ham sandwich and it was delicious. Fresh ingredients and they definitely aren't afraid to give out decent portion sizes because my sandwich was stacked. 

Bottom line is this. I have never been treated this well by a restaurant in my life. The food was also terrific. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister and bro-in-law were in town and we were going to meet them for lunch.  It's the weekend before Christmas and they are headed to Jamaica the next day, lucky bums!!  My daughter and I pulled into the parking lot and it was a zoo!  Between the book store, Trader Joe's and Steinmart located in the same strip mall I was thinking we would never find a spot....however, the parking gods smiled upon us and we found something within 5 minutes of pulling in the lot.  The place was busy but the line moved quickly.  I ordered an Oriental Chicken Salad and a bowl Potato Cream Cheese soup.  Both the salad and the soup came with crusty slices of bread, great for dipping in the soup.  Everything was great.  The salad was fresh and crisp and the dressing was the perfect amount.  The soup...well what could be bad about potato cream cheese??  It was delish!!  My daughter got a half sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie that she gave a big thumbs up to after she devoured it.  We picked up a Gingerbread Santa cookie to snack on later.  It had good flavor but was a tad on the stale side.  Would I go back?  You bet!  The soup and salad alone was awesome and I'd like to try more of their baked goods.  I think I'm having a salad craving as I write this....hmmm......maybe I'll go tomorrow........"}
{"text":"Not long after I moved to Chandler I was looking for a good place for a salad.  I had been to the Wildflower in Tempe so I checked to see if there was a location closer and this is the one that came up.  I plugged the address into my trusty GPS and off I went.  This location is in the mall.  Yes there is a door that leads into it from the outside but if you didn't know that, you would never find it and that night I did not find it.  Flash forward to walking around the mall one day and VIOLA! there it is.  Boy did I feel dumb.  

This location is clean, the staff is friendly and accomadating and the food is good.  The area in front of the counter is large so that you don't get in anyones way while looking at the menu or the baked goods.  They even have a few chairs there so you can sit and wait for your to go order.  There are plenty of tables and some booths.  

I have never had a bad meal here.  I love the oriental chicken salad and the potato cream cheese soup.  I have purchased bread and other baked goods and they were always fresh and delicious.  If I had to choose between Wildflower and Paradise, it would be Wildflower hands down."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the airport to grab a quick bite.
They have really good menu items but most of them are breakfast only (only till 11 am) which to me is stupid to have in an airport. If you have a restaurant inside an airport, there will be people at all times and you should try to provide them at all times (just a suggestion, not taking a star for this).
I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was good. THe food is cheap and filling as well. THey have good seats to sit as well. THey have charging ports as well which to me is a good plus, because most people run out of charge in their cell phone in  an airport (Good marketing strategy).
I charged my phone and slowly enjoyed my Cuban sandwich while I was here.
Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"I've always known this place is a bit expensive, but the food is always fresh and I usually am really happy with the bakery stuff there. I had been having bad experiences (mostly with rude, poor, or non-existent service) at this specific location for awhile so I stopped going all together for a few months. I finally went back for some soup when I was sick and the service had made a remarkable turn around. Everyone was polite, the food was prompt and at top quality. 

Then I went today and they're back to their ways. Obviously couldn't count on the good service lasting too long. The guy who took my order either got it wrong or the person preparing the food disregarded it. I waited for my food for longer than I would have expected and when it didn't come I had to track someone down to ask to check on it. They had it sitting behind the counter. I asked how long it had been there and they replied \"6 minutes\".I asked why they hadn't called my name and he shrugged and walked away. By the time I got home my soup was lukewarm and my sandwich was soggy which makes me think the 6 minute time the food was sitting there was probably much more. The sandwich was also not prepared the way I had ordered it. 

Awhile ago, they would include a card in your to-go orders that said who prepared them and if they got it wrong, instructed you to call in (this may have been at a different Wildflower Bread Company location). I have to guess the reason this location doesn't use them is because their phone would never stop ringing. I'm incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh MY GOSHHHH I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I am here everyday literally the Salmon Cesar salad is theyum.com..  Everyone is so polite..  Frank is Awesome not sure his position but hes very polite and really is concerned with regards to your dining experience!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Wildflower has really good sandwiches, soups and pasta.  Everything tastes really fresh and the food is very reasonable.  

You order at the counter, and your food, although made fresh, is still served up pretty quickly.  They also have a ton of great pastry and cookies at their bakery counter for you to choose from. 

If you're looking for a fast lunch or dinner, check out Wildflower and skip the fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the better options I have had at an airport, especially Sky Harbor. The soup and (Cuban) sandwich combo was pretty reasonably priced, and very delicious. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by for quick breakfast as this was only place open outside of security...service was excellent!! The spicy chipotle egg sandwich was ok...not too spicy and croissant was soft. The breakfast with scrambled egg and ham and potato was ok as well. Egg wasn't very good as it was really clumpy but the ham was pretty good. Potatoes were so so, soft and not crispy at all...overall nothing too exciting but nothing else was open. Really 2.5 stars...only saving grace was the service..."}
{"text":"The Wildflower seed was planted before I even visited this place.  My wife brought on of their Morning Glory muffins home for me.  Yum.  

That got me in the door.  Had to have another Morning Glory muffin.  So when I tried them I also had a small breakfast of eggs and ham which was pretty tasty and reasonable.  And of course I left with another Morning Glory muffin.  I only ate half at a time though.  I'm sure a Morning Glory whole would be pretty fulfilling.

Wildflower is growing on me...

Adding another free wifi place to my list doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. Especially breakfast on the weekends! They will allow you to order off menu, sub egg whites, add/subtract an ingredient. The iced coffee is the best I've had, bold and spicy!

Food recommendations for this Wildflower location are as follows:  Feta and roasted veggie frittata, chicken pistachio pomegranate salad, ANY soup, Chicken Continental Sandwich, Lemon Coconut Cake."}
{"text":"This is the best Wildflower location in the NE Valley, and like the others, the menu crushes anything similar at Paradise Bakery.  Taylor Ham & Egg is still the benchmark breakfast sandwich and they usually have Ethiopian Yrgacheff coffee, which is all killer, no filler."}
{"text":"This definitely wasn't my first time at Wildflower Bread Company, not by a longshot as I've been to several of the other locations but this was my first visit to their sparkling, brand new location near Arrowhead Mall.  I came in early on a Sunday to pick up some food to go, and as one might expect, the restaurant was packed and things were a little chaotic but the service I received was outstanding, from ordering to waiting for my order to be completed, I don't have a single complaint to be made.

     I actually found it rather entertaining sitting at this comfy bar setup they have, watching orders come flying out of the kitchen and getting swooped up quickly, with servers flying around the restaurant.   The person doing the expediting, seemingly a manager, was pretty much on top of everything, with close to a dozen tickets being handled and she was counting down to the exact minute how long each one was taking to be completed, correcting any mistakes, it was very efficient.   

    My order took somewhat longer than expected, which, as I said, not all that unusual for a Sunday morning, but I received a profuse apology for the delay anyways.  Its clear that they really take the quality of service as well as their food quite seriously.   

    As for the actual order, the food, as always has been my experience, was fantastic.  The lemon ricotta pancakes I ordered are absolutely my favorite, always mouth-watering and delicious, the others I was eating with enjoyed their selections of cinnamon-raisin french toast and sausage and egg sandwich as well.   

   So far so good, this new location seems to be off to a great start.  I really like the layout as well, the bar feature is terrific and the overall ambiance is very pleasant.  I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot. for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   The menu is pretty diverse and there seems to be something for everyone."}
{"text":"The menu, service, room, and food all seemed to be aligned when I stopped by. There was no line, plenty of tables, none of the children others have commented about and a very pleasant group of diners.

The menu choices were impressive - it wasn't hard to find something to eat for breakfast at 11:30am. I ordered the Feta & Roasted Veggie Frittata without the feta. It arrived so fast, I didn't have time to open the paper I brought to read. The potatoes were delish, not greasy (at least not greasy to me) and the bread was wonderful. Okay, I don't have bread very often (or potatoes), so I really enjoy it when I do indulge. When I ate the eggs, I realized how much better free range eggs taste and need to go bump up my rating for Matt's Big Breakfast. What a difference in the quality of eggs. The roasted veggies were good. Overall, very satisfying.

I bought a pretzel for later and it was yummy too.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place comes up in the \"vegan\" category considering their only vegan options are a mushroom soup, and bagels. Prices are surprisingly reasonable for the airport, and they offer a variety of 'healthy' salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and coffee beverages. Service is slow, rude, and completely unfamiliar with their menu. When I entered the ordering line I asked an employee about their vegan options, and he straight up replied \"I don't know. Ask the cashier.\"

I got an Iced Americano with soy milk, and a Multigrain bagel with avocado spread and tomato, which came to $7. The coffee was terrible-bitter and watery, with maybe half a shot of espresso. The bagel was thrown together, with the spread on only one side. They didn't even cut it in half. However, it tasted pretty amazing due to the fresh multigrain bread. This was no grocery store bagel. The bread was light but chewy, and packed with freshly baked flavor. A surprisingly delicious lunch, and a real treat at the airport. I would come back here for a bagel, but not for anything else."}
{"text":"I'm going to be very short... as you know Wildflower was my daily morning stop. I took a break just to have something different and have been going to Panera Bread every morning for the last few months. Ive been back to Wildflower a hand full of times this month and there are a lot of new faces and not all very welcoming. I'm not a fan of manager Jeff for various reasons BUT thank God for Tricia!  Her smiles to everyone who comes in and attentiveness to what's happening in the restaurant is admirable. She's a true team leader and a real asset to Wildflower!"}
{"text":"I'm what you could call a regular.......

TOP 6! (Hardest top 6 ever composed)

-breakfast: shortstack of lemon ricotta pancakes w/ side of blueberry compote. UM JUST THE NAME MAKES YOU DROOL

-sweet: chocolate covered croissant. think about it. how can you resist!?

-sandwich: SPICY MEATBALL (get meatballs cut in halves, too big to eat whole!) 

-salad: oriental chicken salad. the best I have ever had.

-cake: CARROT CAKE!!!! or if it's in season, PUMPKIN PIE!!!! best of the best of the besssssssttttttt

-soup: POTATO SOUP. NOTORIOUS FOR THIS!

THE END. let me know how it works out. :)"}
{"text":"This was amazing.  Great menu and too many choices. Lots of tables and good place to chill in the heat and get some work done."}
{"text":"Stopped through for just a quick
Bite to eat before a meeting and Jacob was outstanding at the register and true after the meal was served.  Food was good as well.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The Super Greens Spicy Chicken Salad is probably the best salad I've had in a long time. Surprised it's in an airport. I highly recommend this when in Skyharbor Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my boss. The food has been great, but we were in not too long ago and came up to the register. No one was at the register, no one came up to us or told us they would be with us in a moment, but they could clearly see we were there. There were 4 workers and none of them bothered to say anything for at least 3 minutes. When I did say something, the woman was very snappy and cut me off saying that she would be there in a minute. Very off-putting. The other time I came in though the young girl at the register was very helpful and our to-go orders were great. Overall I really like this place, but the experience sucks when an employee doesn't have better manners."}
{"text":"NO MORE! Been here 2 other times and it was decent, I ordered the \"sweet potato\" sandwich and it came with a side of either chips, cole slaw, or \"res bliss \"potato salad. So when I asked the 18 year old cashier \"what's in the potato salad?\" She tells me \"uhh.. It's like.. Potato salad.. I don't know?\", only to find out they were out of it any way so I had to settle for kettle chips. Then it takes 25 minutes to get my food, a family of 3 who sat down 10 min after me got their food first, I had to ask the server to check on my order, when he brings it to me I ask for a side of Sourdough bread and he looks at me like I'm crazy and starts telling me he doesn't know what I'm talking about for 5 minutes and he is speaking english but I cant understand him over the thick accent, they are KNOWN for giving out free sides of bread with your order. Finally I get the bread and its regular white bread, at this point I'm to burnt out on this place and just want to eat. For some reason the bread TASTED the way a wet dog SMELLS if that makes any sense, almost made me sick, the sandwich was DISGUSTING and I paid $10 for this meal. In all: BAD SERVICE, OVER PRICED, SUB PAR FOOD. No more wild flower for me.. Sorry."}
{"text":"Ive been going here since i was a baby! I highly recommend their potato cream cheese soup and any salad! They have so many amazing options and a really relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. I love that they are attached to a really cool bookstore(:"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for breakfast. Really comfortable seating and nice ambiance.  I like the sausage and egg with cibatta.  Prices not a steal but comfortable enough. Coffee selection is nice as well"}
{"text":"The only thing gluten free here is the salads. Should not be advertised as a gluten free bakery/restaurant."}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly and helped with the menu.  The Server, person working the floor Noah was very receptive, checked in on us several times and ensured we had everything we need.....additionally the manager stopped by the table.  Great experience....and the food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I want to discuss the excellence of the food here, but first the bread alone is worth mentioning:

Think of the best bread you can buy at a regular grocery store, even from their bakery.  Now imagine a bread that is much better, a solid 5 or 6 times better, and you have the Wildflower Bakery bread.  They offer a variety of artisan styles, and they will slice the loaves for you.  I say loaves, because you should buy at least two.

Now on to the menu:

This is a breakfast and lunch place.  All of the items that come with bread are, you guessed it, made with the wonderful bread  mentioned above.  All of the sandwiches are outstanding.  A few that stick out to me are:

BLT sandwich

Sweet potato sandwich

Beef Brisket sandwich


All of the breakfasts are healthy, tasty, and leave you feeling energized.  I wish Harlow's in Tempe had this type of food. Wildflower is delicious, fresh, and healthy.

You order at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.  It always seems like you won't get a table when they are busy, but as if by the use of magic, we always get a table well before our food is ready.

I have never had a bad experience, and the consistency of what they offer is astounding.  It impresses me when a company can be so good, so often."}
{"text":"I have had a few issues in the past for pick up orders.  Have been beyond impressed how they were so amazing to compensate .  Tristen is their shining gem and is sure fire to guarantee everything is amazing.  Great staff, super friendly, light and clean and airy atmosphere...highly recommend!   This Dallas gal LOVES her PHX Wildflower!!!"}
{"text":"The depth of lunch selections were intriguing. I loved my poets Ella mushroom sandwich. The store was packed. We were fortunate to grab a private room in the back which was mice and quiet. I was impressed how the similar restaurant concept to Panera was elevated by great cuisine and service. I love the fact that they serve and clean up after you. I also loved having so many new vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Visited Wildflower before my flight and the food was ready very quickly. The service was beyond exceptional. Britney Reid was very kind and had such a great smile. She took great care of us. Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Sweet cafe... and a mecca for carb lovers

My little girl and I hit Wildflower every other week on our daddy-daughter day.  It's a nice diversion from the fast food places she usually gravitates towards (dang you marketers!).

Sandwiches, soups, and salads are all tasty.  Dessert bar is uber yum.  The layout is comfortable for eating and chatting.  And they have seasonal special-order baked goods-- e.g., cross buns for Easter, cupcakes for Valentines, pastries for Mother's Day, et al.

Only knock is the ordering can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. We go there for the pretzels and bread but this location the pretzels were way over cooked and brown and tough. The ciabatta roll I had on my sand which was so tough that when I tried to bite it all the stuff on the inside came out.  I will hope that I catch them on a better day but it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Fresh, delicious, HEALTHY food!  It's a great place to have a meal with your family, a business meeting, or to get together with the girls. The salads are the BEST..my personal favorite is the Chopped Salad with salmon. I have NEVER been disappointed with this salad.  It is simply delicious.  It comes with a pesto dressing on the side but I always ask for the grape serrano dressing.  Actually, the salad is so good it doesn't even need any dressing. They bake their own bread and all of it is soooo good!  My husband really likes their meatball sandwich.  He's had other sandwiches too and has never been disappointed. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the staff are very professional and happy.  You won't be disappointed coming to place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Even in triple digit heat, we eat hot soup about 5 times weekly. Tried a bowl of Seafood Bisque here today and it's a new top 3 favorite. Yummy bowl is filling with bread on side. Pleasant fast service."}
{"text":"My 3 star review is not for the food or lack of service (well, sort of. I miss your lemon penne dearly and rarely come back because you don't have that or the fruit tart anymore) its for what happened while my family and I popped in, or lack there of, that has me puzzled, and really grossed out.

Let me start by saying we are animal lovers. We have several pets of our own. They do not however, accompany us to restaurants.  Why am I starting my review off with that? Keep reading. We were sitting in the second to last booth (near the second, east-most exit) enjoying a quick meal. All of a sudden, my husbands eyes got very large. A man, who was walking his CAT, was proceeding to come inside with said cat. It was not in a carrier of any kind, it did not have a service vest or tag of any kind, just a leash. He proceeded to pick the cat up, and set it down in the booth. Yes, you read that right. His cat. It was black. 

The cat was freaking out, so you can go and check for the scratches on your booth for yourself if you don't believe me. Based on what we heard, he used it several times as his scratching post. 

What shocked me, is that everyone in the restaurant saw this happen, including some employees I am quite sure, and no one said anything! This is against health code...right? My husband and son are both highly allergic to cats. We waited for about 10 minutes before we completely lost our appetites and left. Another customer even asked my husband if that was in fact, a cat, the man had walked in with. 

As we left, I confirmed it was indeed a cat, as it was sitting on the seat of the booth, next to the man. 

Your food is good, but not that good. We will opt for another location next time. Ick!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! I love their soup and sandwich combo!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place and the food was OK . We went there for Breakfast and I could not believe the portions of food they give you.. . My Friend order an omelet and it was the smallest omelet i have even seen.. They need to go back up and order more food.. Watch what you order and if you are really hungry please do not go here.."}
{"text":"Why do I forget that you exist??  Delicious, fresh food and great atmosphere to work or meet people for coffee/lunch.  I tend to order the same thing every time because its SOOO good but today I finally ventured out and had the chicken pom salad.  Just like the other meals that I have had here, it was yum!   Two suggestions to get people like me to visit more  1)  prices are kinda expensive. I know its quality and youre a local biz but I would love to have some lower priced options so I can spend $10max for lunch.  Or 2)   Give us a frequent visitor card to encourage us to visit more frequently and aappreciate the value. Paradise Bakery which is direct competition but not as tasty (and coffee is way worse at PB) has a fantastic program which gets me (and other friends, biz owners) to visit.   Id also give a 5 star review if you addes a program such as (buy 10 coffees, get 1 free or buy 8 lunches, get one free)."}
{"text":"First time ever happening. I love the place. Came in saw a few staff working. Not sure if they were short handed. Usually you get greeted. I stood at the counter for about a minute looking at desserts and no acknowledgement. I walked out. Yes, I'll be back another day. Peace."}
{"text":"I hear the breakfast is superb. Dinner was acceptable, but I ate diabetic, and that's not the best choice in this place. Tempting pastries and baked goods."}
{"text":"This Wildflower location is hit or miss. The food is really inconsistent; one day the butternut squash ravioli will come with sauce that's like a soup, other days it won't come with sauce at all. The manager told us it was impossible to make extra sauce because each batch is made to order...? I know that is a flat-out lie. Whatever. This is the only Wildflower in the area for me and I still really enjoy coming here.

Update: I'm editing this review and adding a star because 1. I really do love Wildflower, despite the customer service issues this location has and 2. the CEO personally contacted me, which I saw as an endearing and positive representation of the brand. I feel that if a CEO or member of management takes the time to accept criticisms, then positive changes will follow."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I have found the holy grail of veggie sandwiches. As anyone who eats with me often knows (and as you can probably tell from my reviews), I tend to prefer vegetarian lunch options than meat ones. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I'm picky about meat quality and I often don't think meat adds much to sandwiches, so I tend to stick to sandwiches with roasted vegetables and cheese or a pita with hummus/falafel. 

Anyway, I had already tried the roasted sweet potato sandwich at Wildflower - although the fig confit was a bit too sweet for me, it definitely went well with the mozzarella and the sweet potato. Then, last week at work, I tried the Portabello Picnic (roasted portobello, zucchini, eggplant, roma tomato, arugula and herb goat cheese on grilled Pasilla Chili Rye) and thought it was really, really good. Often, restaurants totally overcook portabellos and eggplant but this portobello, eggplant, and zucchini was tender (but not mushy) and tasted perfectly fresh. The herb goat cheese and slightly savory rye bread complemented each other and provided the perfect finishes to the delicious roasted vegetables. Loved every bite!

Even if you're not a vegetarian, I think you will find this sandwich hearty and satisfying."}
{"text":"So  much better than Paradise!
The bread and cookies are great.... I always have a great lunch here!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Mixed Grill Sandwich! Besides the salmon BLT at Four Peaks, I'd say this is one of my favorite sandwiches in the Phoenix Area! I came here with a friend to catch up on some work. I ordered my usual chopped salad and my friend ordered the Mixed Grill. She wanted to try something new so I had one bite of her sandwich. It's savory, sweet, and all around delicious! I thought I was tasting wasabi spread because it's got a hint of spiciness to it. I found out its honey mustard with grilled onion that adds to the flavor. I had sour dough bread with my order and absolutely love this sandwich. I had to come again the following day to order it for myself! I will probably head there this week to eat another! It's savory and one of my sandwich favorites!"}
{"text":"Yum! Had the sweet potato sandwich and I have to say that was absolutely delicious and would have a hard time ordering something else when I go again. It was strongly suggested so I tried it - yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"If I could eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner here everyday, I would. As a pasta connoisseur, I guarantee you Wildflower has some of the best pasta in town. I can't say if the Pasta Primavera or Three Cheese Ravioli is my favorite because they both knock my socks off. But what I can say is that I crave it on a day to day basis.

I'm not bluffing. Wildflower isn't just a restaurant, it's an experience. It's not just the satisfying food. You can tell the manager cares about this place and his customers because all of the employees I've encountered have always been super friendly and accommodating. Destinee (?), one of the cashiers that I usually always see, is extremely nice and always gives great customer service.

There's never been a time I regretted coming here. So I urge you to visit this amazing place! You'd be doing yourself a favor."}
{"text":"I always stop into the Tempe Wildflower cafe after visiting Changing Hands, because it's a fantastic place to settle down into a good book or have dinner with some of my fellow book club members. The location can get really crowded after dark on weeknights, but there's always plenty of seating on Sunday evenings and afternoons.

The food can be hit-or-miss, and even the quality of its best items can vary wildly depending on who made it. My personal favorite menu item is the butternut squash ravioli, although the sauce is often poorly made. The best drink, bar none, is the blackberry orange lemonade. In addition to its ordinary menu, there are new seasonal items available every couple of months. The baked sweets are very rich, and sometimes end up overwhelming the sandwiches/other meal items if ordered together. Good luck trying to get a white vanilla cupcake, though--they're always sold out. On average, the food is a little overpriced, but an evening out won't break the bank either.

After patronizing the location for nearly two years and at least two or three times a month, I can safely say the most of the waiters and waitresses skew towards inexperienced college students, and the service is about what can be expected from that crowd. Sometimes the service is wonderful and enthusiastic, other times they make you feel unwanted or unreasonable. The premises is adequately clean most of the time, but you can usually tell when it's been a busy day or night. Make no mistake, there WILL be flies about. 

Pass on the breakfast menu. For the prices, you can do breakfast much, much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Wildflower Bread Co. closer to where I live, so I've been eating here at the Indian School location. Most of my comments on the Tempe location are applicable here: good food, good service, and a little overpriced for a casual cafe. 

Two noteworthy comments:

1) This particular WFB is very spacious and clean, especially when compared to the cramped and fly-infested Tempe location. Perfect for book clubs or low-key family gatherings.

2) If you order anything with sauce, prepare yourself to be buried in it. With some dishes, it's almost like being served a soup!"}
{"text":"I am truly touched by the customer service of Wildflower. Overwhelmed by the letter I received in the mail today from the founder, Louis Basile Jr.  Enclosed was a $10 check, to refund me for my sandwich (see review above), and a $12 gift card, for when I return again! This type of customer support deserves an award! Big thanks to Louis for reaching out to me! I always thought that Wildflower was a great restaurant, but this is just over the top! Wildflower truly takes care of their customers!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Waited over 20 min for a takeout. The salmon alfredo was bland with a small dry piece of salmon, the cheddar beef sandwich was all bread and greens...had to pick through to see if they forgot the beef.  Neither was worth the $10+ each cost."}
{"text":"Food and service in this place is amazing :) I was suggested a taste of the soups today and I was delighted with both the soup and the salad I purchased. Couldnt ask for more in an airport :). Very happy camper :)"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Panera and Au Bon Pain. I got the ultimate grilled cheese. Not sure why they put tomato and arugula on grilled cheese. What ever happened to good old fashioned cheese and bread? lol The chocolate chip cookie was good. It was huge.

This place is a bit expensive but airport food is always insanely expensive so I guess it's to be expected. This is probably one of the healthiest options at the airport though. 

Service was quick and the cashier was friendly.

Overall this place is nothing special. Not bad, not good."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever to eat here.  The staff is very friendly. Chicken and pesto sandwich was really good and the roasted garlic tomato soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Breakfast was delicious . I had the spinach, cheese , roasted pepper and tomatoes frittata . Really really good! The orange juice is amazing and you can not stop eating the bread! They bake their own."}
{"text":"My first time at a Wildflower Bread Company - enjoyed a great (and ample) Asian salad with wonderful artisan bread on the side.  Food was very good and well priced.  Very friendly service at the counter.  Had exceptional service from Frank, who brought us our food, checked on us several times and even brought us drink refills.  He made my first trip to Wildflower a very pleasant experience.  Thanks, Frank!"}
{"text":"Interesting. 
Kind of like Panera but much better.
I got a turkey pastrami which had some amazing slaw stuff on it."}
{"text":"Their chopped salad is life changing. And no I'm not exaggerating. Do yourself a favor and eat this salad everyday. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here! Fast and healthy. It's nice to go and also a nice place to stay and eat. My favorite is the v12 kale salad, it has 12 different veggies in it!"}
{"text":"Traveling on way to Midwest, ok but not any better than ok, a bit healthier than most airport food. I would skip and try another establishment next time. Vegetable soup below average, half tuna sandwich good but soggy. Pleasant staff tho, very helpful"}
{"text":"I absolutely kove Wildflower, and a lot of other people do to because it is quite busy during bkfast, lunch, and dinner times. But I dont mind because they are always quite fast at getting your food ready and bringing it to your table. I love that I can sit in and outside as well. I have never had any bad food here and I especially love the potato cream cheese soup. BONUS POINTS for being open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Love this place- friendly staff with a variety of menu options and lots of yummy salads.  I almost always get a salad and have yet to find one that I don't like.  I haven't tried any pastas, but they look good.  The soups are always good too, but definitely ask for some bread to dip in the soup!"}
{"text":"Good food, fun menu, and pretty good service. No real complaints here...it gets hectic when its busy...but the employees make up for it in kindness and competence :)"}
{"text":"Love the wildflower (classic) salad and potato cream cheese soup. This location is nice. They have complimentary bath and body mini lotions in the bathroom! That's what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"That cauliflower steak tho!!! . Amazing food, super nice staff, clean and happy. The perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Place is open 24/7 and has healthy options. Service is great, employees are efficient and keep their spot clean. Food and coffee are great, too."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, great location and nice service. The book store next door is connected to the restaurant which is nice for those that buy a book and then come into the restaurant to eat and read. I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and it was fresh and tasty. They were generous with the amount of chicken they put in. The iced tea was also tasty. Wife wasn't too hungry so she just ordered a slice of chocolate cake and she loved it."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and the food was prepared with the best presentation, I will recommend this spot to all my clients. This place also make a great meeting spot for all occasions. Business or pleasure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite before a flight. My card was getting declined. After the kind cashier Daniel tried a few time I began to dig for another card to use. Before I could get to another card that said they got it. They paid it forward and covered me! Such a surprise. Thank you for your kindness! :)"}
{"text":"I had a brunch with my friend today. I had Banana Walnut Pancakes ,OMG it was soooo good. I couldn't eat all so I had it for dinner, just microwave it for 30 seconds. and it was so good as left over. Can I have a recipe? LOL Or, do you sell pancake mix?"}
{"text":"Turkey & Brie Sandwich with the Forest Mushroom soup....OMG YUM-TOWN!!!! Line can get a little long around lunch time but the wait is beyond worth it.  Make sure you get the Blackberry orange lemonade as well....a LARGE and one to go, it's AMAZING!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Initially, I ran in to pick up a hot peppermint tea to soothe my sinuses. After a glance at the menu--decided to order a grilled chicken pesto on soft ciabatta. Beautiful presentation and flavor. The ingredients were so fresh and colorful, it reminded me of dining in Paris. All of this tucked away in a standard suburban mall. Surprise, surprise."}
{"text":"Pleasant casual setting. You order cafe style and they bring it to your table. Limited booths so secure your booth first before ordering. Tables are ok but not as comfortable as booths. Food was well prepared and above average taste. We had a club sandwuch and a cobb salad. The service was excellent and they had a person that clears the table for you.. Friendly and casual environment. Very popular and rightfully so."}
{"text":"Samantha at Store 17 was very big part of a very pleasant experience and great food when we went by Sky Harbor to pick up a family member."}
{"text":"I come for the chocolate chip scones and coffee it is disappointing that the store is dirty floors is disgusting."}
{"text":"Not as swanky or loaded with Newt Glass as the Scottsdale location but still serving the same great coffee, free Wi-Fi, and friendly staff as all the other Wildflowers this will be my \"home base\" location for a long time to come.  7 miles from home - straight shot on the 101.  Love it."}
{"text":"Not sure I like the layout of this Wildflower as much as the one on Pima or Indian School, but the same quality coffees, sodas, and goods as well as glass sculptures and free Wi-Fi are all present and accounted for.  The double-sided center island simply creates for too much \"carry-over\" noise, particularly when children are present."}
{"text":"My Wildflower of Choice not only because the seating options are much more conducive to studying, but also because the way the soda and coffee layout prevents the clustering of people that makes the Pima location less than ideal.  Good coffee at a fair price, free wi-fi, and the Newt Glass work always makes me smile."}
{"text":"...No Newt Glass Art. 
...Full of obnoxious college kids.
...no electrical outlets.
...small, crowded, and far too loud.
...its a good thing I did not find this particular Wildflower before the other three or I'd have probably never given the others a chance."}
{"text":"Nice layout to this location of Wildflower but between the unstable Wi-Fi and overly loud *pop* certainly not the best place to get any work done.  Friendly servers, as always, and another in a growing local chain perhaps they need time to fine tune, but for now I'll drive the extra miles for a different location."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite daytime joints, nothing is better than an late Saturday lunch at Wildflower with a cup of the Potato Soup (during the winter months) or Salad during the summer and an ice tea. My only complaint would be that it is always busy, but that is a good sign I guess."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, and reasonably priced. I'd say it's on par with Paradise Bakery or Panera, but it's usually really hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I got some take out earlier this week. I had never eaten here before and, since it's a bread company and I'm GF, I ordered a salad. Figured I was safe. It did state that bread came with but I figured I would give that to a coworker. What I didn't plan on was the bread coming right on top of my salad. I just assumed it would be on the side. So since half of my salad was now contaminated (cross-contamination is a real thing for people with GF sensitivities), I only ate half. Woe was I. And hungry... by 2:00 lol!
Having said that, my selection was the turkey salad with grapes and apples etc. I will say it was delicious. The dressing was a simple but tasty vinaigrette. I would likely given them a 2nd try but note to self, NO bread!"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. Service is always wonderful, food comes out quickly and they always get my order correct! They have so many amazing deserts and a great chicken Parmesan sandwich! A lot of the stuff comes with mushroom though(like on a Caesar salad which is weird), so if you don't like mushroom be sure to say so!"}
{"text":"I would put Wildflower's sandwiches up against just about any other sandwich shop in Tempe. The toppings are delicious and go far beyond your standard ham or turkey, lettuce or tomato. But the bread here is the real star, more expensive than a loaf from the supermarket but infinitely more flavorful. 

Wash it down with their fresh lemonade, and you will find yourself coming back.

Order this now: Gorgonzola and roast beef sandwich with a cup of potato cream cheese soup"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat.  I'm here about 2 times a week.  Not one bad meal yet. Breakfast,  dinner, pastries even the iced tea is great."}
{"text":"I ordered a coffee here right before thanksgiving on a busy travel day and in a sleepy haze forgot to grab my credit card. I forgot all about it and 15 minutes pass as I'm waiting for my plane. The clerk walked up and down the terminal shouting my name till he found me. I realize this doesn't have to do with quality of food but the company was willing to go the extra mile to help a customer on a busy day which deserves 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then consider Wildflower's Chopped Salad an edible tribute to The Original, Chopped Salad that is. Taking a leaf (ha!) out of Cowboy Ciao's playbook, Wildflower created a sumptuous version that mirrors, not copies, the salad so famous it has it's own Facebook page. Seriously. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad  

I've had the original and agree it's divine, but in the showdown of similarly named salads, my pick is the Chopped Salad from Wildflower and here's why: 

1. Price. At under $8, I can (and do!) eat this salad weekly without worrying about my wallet. The Original Chopped Salad is a whopping $12. 

2. Convenience: With multiple Wildflower locations, I can cave into my craving for this salad for lunch or dinner while in Phoenix or Gilbert or Scottsdale or wherever. 

3. Size: In this case, size does matter and the Chopped Salad from Wildflower seems almost twice the size of the Original Chopped Salad. 

In the battle of chopped salads, I declare Wildflower the winner!

{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant a lot! I couldn't give it five stars because the BlackBerry orange lemonade that I ordered wasn't a free refill. I ordered the soup(cheddar &broccoli) and half sandwich (BLT plus) they both were very good and I was full after! We went during breakfast hours and I was pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to order from the breakfast menu! If your ever that way give them a try....it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Loved my butternut squash ravioli.  Also had their blackberry orange lemonade.  Very good.  Super nice price for the airport."}
{"text":"Pretentious. But sometimes you want that for lunch. Food is good. You just have to chew a lot. Lots of vitamin rich food."}
{"text":"Wildflower is my favorite! I will never leave and can't get enough of the chopped salad. I eat at the one by my house at least 3 times a week and try to come to this one for lunch once a week since it's next to my work. I have to give it 2 stars though. I've  been coming to lunch at this location for over a year now and it is never staffed correctly at lunch. Always a long wait. Always. Sometimes I try to call the order in ahead of time and today when I tried it took over a minute for someone to answer the phone- not to mention there is one person at the register with about 15 people in line. So I just had to write a review. \"Love-dislike\" relationship with this location. Come on guys!"}
{"text":"A BIG Thanks to Wildflower Ashton and manager Todd for great service today! The food is always fantastic and the new summer garden salad was no exception! The food was served fast despite the extra busy cafe and as always, the employees were awesome!"}
{"text":"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly."}
{"text":"The BLT on toasted sourdough with avocado and herb mayonnaise was so good!"}
{"text":"It took a while, but I have gone back to Wildflower twice since I wrote the bad review.  Both times were exceptional.  Great service and each time the person helping me went out of their way to make sure I was not eating anything with my allergen. The food was excellent.   Wildflower is now one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Best Caesar salad and their homemade bread is to die for. Beyond good I love going to this place anytime anywhere"}
{"text":"We eat here probably more that we should, but it's close to church and convenient to our daily paths.  The food (breakfast, sandwiches, soup and salads) is always very good and we just enjoy going there. Although you order at the counter and they deliver to your table, the staff is always very friendly and they go out of their way to serve you the best they can.  Every item we've ever eaten there is very tasty and the prices are reasonable and fairly easy to absorb in this day and age of rapidly rising restaurant food costs.  They do a great job with their bakery items and we've enjoyed those over the years as well.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love the cream cheese potato soup here! When I'm not feeling well or someone I love is sick, this is exactly where I go for soup! The smoked salmon Alfredo is also yummy!"}
{"text":"Starting with a little bread sample when you come in... sometimes the service is a little slow but everything else is top notch! Fresh and flavorful salads are my pick!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and stopped by Wildflower Bread Company for lunch.  The food is delicious and made to order.  We had the pleasure of meeting Frank.  The hospitality that was shown to us was incredible.  I have two young girls and he went out of his way to engage them in conversation and ensure they had a great afternoon!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat hands down. Always best customer service and very clean! Food comes fast and I'm always satisfied"}
{"text":"Amazing staff...great food! I couldn't ask for more!!! I'm greeted the minute I step foot in the door. They are incredibly helpful & answer any questions I may have. Their customer service is impeccable. I would recommend anybody to give them a shot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This is probably the best go to restaurant when visiting Chandler Fashion Square. They have the most consistency, menu options, and the best service. I eat there quite a bit and will always recommend it."}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Company has been one of my favorite lunch spots for years. The forest mushroom soup and asparagus soup have been my absolute favorites. I always ask for 9 grain bread with mine. 
The wildflower salad is very good. I like to get it with the grilled chicken. 
If you like iced tea-the passion fruit is amazing. 
Of course their baked goods are delicious too-pumpkin chocolate chip muffin is awesome. 
Today the restaurant was super busy as always. Just disappointed that they ran out of ice while we were in line for drinks, ran out of lids for the drink cups and the bathroom sink was dirty. The server went out of his way to bring my husband croutons for his soup."}
{"text":"Love the environment, love the food...,. Just a tad bit too spendy.   Lots of variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Waited at he register while two employees  had an argument in front of me. When I asked if I could order,  both snapped at me and told me \"in a minute. \"  I asked for a manager and the man told me he was the manager. Which was a lie, because afterwards my husband went and talked to the actual manager. My order took longer than average to be delivered to the table., even though the place was practically empty - no doubt because the two resumed their argument. Chopped salad was fine. Would not recommend or go back due to poor level of service and lack of integrity of the employees. Mad Greens is right next door- will go there next time."}
{"text":"I always try to stay away from chains, but I heard that Wildflower Bread Co. served healthy, good food and had a reputation for serving the community. I was willing to give it a shot.  
I came during my lunch break and drove 15 minutes to get there, so I was excited when I ordered a chicken parmesan. When I paid, my card got declined. My whole face fell. 
\"I'm so sorry I have to cancel my order. I forgot they're mailing me a new debit card because my card expired,\" I said. I was beet red with embarrassment and even more bummed out that I drove a quarter of my break to go back to the office hungry. I didn't express any of this to the cashier, but as I turned to walk away, the cashier called after me, \"Wait, hey it's okay. It's on us.\"
I looked at her in disbelief. \"Are you sure??\" I asked her. 
She smiled, \"Yeah,\" and she rang up the order, \"It's okay, it happens,\" she said. I thanked her graciously!
So first off, I want to thank this specific store and staff, for this act of kindness. One act of kindness is all it takes to make someone's day a little better, and it not only made mine, but is something I will always remember.
Second off, my chicken parm was delicious! It was fresh mozzarella chunks that were melting off into delicious chicken - the ingredients were fresh and delectable. I absolutely loved the way they plated it.`
For this, I have to give this eatery a 5-star, good food, great service? I don't care if it's a chain, this place rocks and I'm a fan."}
{"text":"It's easy like Sunday morning. Actually it's busy on Sunday morning.

They have a pastry case which beats out both Starbucks & Paradise combined, but would you expect less from a bread company?

I ordered my standard soy latte with sugar free vanilla, and it was good!  Dare I say better than the one Paradise sells?  Yes, I dare.

I also went with the Peach Bran muffin.  My first bite from the top of the muffin contained a large slice of sweet peach.  Delicious.  The muffin top was fairly moist, but the muffin rump was a little dry.

I'll be back to try the Blueberry pancakes Sarah wrote about."}
{"text":"Great soups, nice atmosphere, and fantastic, friendly service. Been many times and it is always a pleasure to eat there."}
{"text":"I've been here may times before,  but never during the lunch rush.  Food was very good.  Staff was running like a very well oiled machine.  They moved the orders quickly.  What a great team you have working at this location!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 3years now and I have not once had a bad experience! I think wildflower strives to have excellent service and they pull it off. I am sorely going to miss this place when I move. Great coffee and great breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday evening for a healthy bite and to enjoy the amazing weather on the patio. I was little surprised that at 6:30 pm, it wasn't busy at all!

Great menu selection, more versatile and healthy than Panera.

I went with the Caesar salad and added on salmon.. To add it on, I believe the cost was $2-3 which is almost unheard of. Once I got my salad, I realized why the salmon was priced that way as it wasn't actually grilled fresh in the back, but rather was cooked at an earlier time, refrigerated and then put on the salad cold. I was kinda of bummed, because I feel that it really lacked flavor. 

Other than that, the salad was great.. Great food for the price and I felt it was of the same quality that you'd find at a more up-scale restaurant. 

I was the only patron on the patio and really appreciated the staff's attentiveness in coming out to make sure I was enjoying my meal and checking if I needed anything else."}
{"text":"First time here and the turkey pastrami grilled sandwich I ordered was pretty good! But the menu said I would get sweet potato chips on the side and it came out with about 4 and the rest were regular chips. My boyfriend got the meatball sandwich and he loved it."}
{"text":"Excited that Wildflower has been opened closer to my house!  A great place to come and enjoy breakfast, brunch, lunch, etc.  The restaurant is nice and spacious, lots of table room to do a quick study session before school/ an exam.  The best past is the coffee and they offer SOY milk which is a big PLUS!"}
{"text":"Thank for Wild Flower for sending my a $12 gift card for writing a review for his yummy place..

I ordered the Salmon Alfredo with a side Caesar salad and the bloody orange lemonade.

The Alfredo was delicious! The sauce had so much flower and the salmon put a great touch to it..

The Caesar salad was a little sour, but it was still good. 

My stomach is happy!"}
{"text":"Rye bread was my favorite.

We ordered the Grilled turkey pastrami with chicken lemon vegetable soup and pink lemonade.

The meal was great as always, more on the higher end for cost.

They do not give free refills on the lemonade, they pretty much charge you for another drink."}
{"text":"Good food, although a bit on the higher end price wise. I did have the spicy meatball sandwich and it was exactly that, spicy. Personally I absolutely loved it as it was seasoned and cooked very well! Clean and friendly location and service."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good breakfast here.  I had a sausage & egg sandwich, scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered ciabatta Roll.  The egg filling was very good, but the ciabatta roll was kinda tough and hard to eat.  B.J. had the egg breakfast and pancakes.  They were pretty good.  I wasn't really excited about the place, it was okay."}
{"text":"Ate here during a layover and I fell in love!  Their Cuban sandwich was AMAZING!!!!!!    Omg!  I looked them up and see that there are no locations in TX, which makes me sad.  I highly recommend eating here.  I wish I wouldn't have been in a rush when ordering because instead of buying a bottle of water I would have tried one of their lemonades.  Just another reason to plan a layover in Phoenix when flying!  ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place:
- Good food, love the soups at night & salads for lunch (they actually split it for me)...and the bread...mmm
- Great people, they remember my bible study group at the Arrowhead location (thanks Stephanie) & the Deer Valley location (close to work) always fantastic and happy"}
{"text":"Super yummy spring quinoa salad!!! Really fresh and flavorful. Huge portion; you won't go hungry. The daily homemade bread is really good for special events."}
{"text":"This is a delicious place for a layover lunch! Between the three of us we tried a cold sandwich, hot half sandwich, soup, and a sweet roll - all were great! Tasty, fresh, and very creative ingredients.  Looking forward to the return trip!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this location... Trying to get off grid for breakfast options, and seriously looking for the spot on Ham n Swiss bfast sammich,, but he a panini is close.. 

Food was awesome, wife's, chowder was delicious,, 
My Ham n Swiss sammich , notate the cheese is melted into the scrambled eggs,, ehh its ok,, but some bites, no cheese, while others I could taste.. so,, 70% there ..

Yes , due to proximity I will be back"}
{"text":"Six am in the PHX terminal and the volume on the annoying noise that passes for modern music is turned up to 11. People have to yell to be understood. Maybe the volume could be at 6 or 7 until 8 am. The loud noise puts everyone in a bad mood. 

Average and bland food but I guess I'm supposed to  like it because it is allegedly organic and sustainable. I don't want political food disguised as a marketing scheme. I don't fit the market profile."}
{"text":"This place is like panera on steroids aka way better. I really liked this place for lunch.

i got the portabella picnic and large blackberry lemonade. DELICIOUS!!! Everything is made with fresh ingredients!!!! The sandwich bread was toasted perfectly and they had fresh arugula, goat cheese, and portabella mushrooms. I'm usually not a fan of vegetarian options but this sandwich was YUMMY!!!! I know some other people got soup and said it tasted like homemade soup.

I highly recommend this place for gourmet sandwiches, salads, and soups. You can mix and match 2 as well! High quality for the prices- sandwhichs $8-9."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, almost $10 for flavorless herb focaccia, it was a huge chunk of bread though if you just want bread with a little flavoring.  I ordered sweet potato sandwich, the ingredients were very sparse and all piled in the middle. Asked for mixed chips instead of potato salad, got a huge bag of potato chips with 2 sweet potato chips in the bag. Mozzarella had no flavor. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the positive reviews. A Fellow yelper recommended the Potato Cream Cheese soup- so i got it.. and it was awesome and i was definitely doubting it at first..

I also got the roasted turkey brie sandwich (half sandwich with soup), also awesome.. thick slice of BRIE for a brie cheese lover is the way to go!

They have samples of bread and butter at one of the entrances.. we all know what bread tastes like but this was a bonus for me to nimble on while i waited to pick up my order.

:) they had pumpkin cheesecake in the display case!! I haven't tried it but i know its so good.. I'm gonna buy this tomorrow and bring it to thanksgiving dinner! (and act like i made it! just kidding) nom nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"I've had different things every time I come here. The lemon ricotta pancakes and spicy chorizo frittata are amazing. The staff is always upbeat and friendly, especially Gavin."}
{"text":"I just finished my tuna sandwich and it wasgood. What I find surprising is the booth we chose to sit at is in disrepair. Both sides of the booth has a big hole in the fabric and the bencb where u sit is ripped and is very uncomfortable. Also the pendant light above the table has a layer of dust. For 24.00 dollars I would expect the place to be better kept up."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience. I will definitely revisit this location. Our waitress was Sarah who gave great food recommendations, and took great care of us. A+ effort on her behalf. She could Run this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been going to wildflowers for a long time now! Probably 2 years or so. Food is great- I recommend anything that peaks your interest. Pastries are all very good as well. MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION would be Sugar cookies. I'd probably buy everyone if they had sugar cookies."}
{"text":"First time at this WFBC, Michael (manager), Stephanie (cashier), as well as Lori (who I believe is also a manager), provided great customer service throughout our visit. The atmosphere provided was relaxing, comfortable, and very enjoyable. -- Stephanie took care of us even though we customized our meals, and made sure it was correct once the meal was brought out to us. 

Thanks for the great service, we'll both be back to this location thanks to those three."}
{"text":"I love this place. When my parents are in town, we eat here about 4 times a week.  The staff is amazing. When I was Vegan, the girl at the counter pulled out a huge binder of all the ingredients of everything to make sure she was suggesting food I could eat. She went above and beyond, unlike Paradise/Panera who just said they didn't have anything for me. Wildflower is amazing. Their food is fantastic. So flavorful! I usually get the V12 Kale Salad, which is always an amazing choice, but I've tried the vegetarian seasonal sandwiches, which are great and the soups. Love the soup bowls!!! I could even just live off of their bread and butter."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to leave a review, and I'm really not the type to take pictures of my food. This however was so delicious that I needed to share it! This morning I had the sweet potato breakfast bowl. The flavor is so well matched, I truly enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. This time my daughter and I wanted to try something different off the menu. The usual suspects for us are the chocolate chip scones and chocolate croissants, with a good coffee and chocolate milk. We are kind of chocoholics...lol. We ordered a Taylor ham & Swiss on a grilled Ciabatta Roll (6.59) and a Feta & Roasted Vegetable fritatta which has roasted eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, tomatoes & feta which also comes with rosemary home fries & choice of bread, which I chose sourdough (8.69). Yum! We always come for brekkie and will need to come for lunch one of these days! I am eyeing the salmon BLT and the Asian Chicken Salad! We will be back of course!"}
{"text":"I love this healthy restaurant. So many delicious and nutritious options on the menu.
Today I got Chipotle Spinach Plus Salad and Forrest Mushroom  Soup. Yummy!!!
My favorite Salad is Chopped Salad.
And my favorite soup is Autumn Pumpkin .
You should stop by and give it a try"}
{"text":"Great spot if you're looking to eat at the airport without having to go through security. Airport restaurants are notorious for grumpy employees and bad service. This Wildflower location has neither. We got great service from Samantha and were pleasantly surprised with how good the food tasted. Will definitely go again if in need of a bite at the airport."}
{"text":"Never before been to this place and decided to stop in for a quick lunch after several friends recommended it. I got the Triple Club sandwich and a raspberry and cheese pastry. The club was just okay. A bit dry with the third layer of bread in the middle. The pastry was also a bit dry but I should have known better since they were laying out in an open display case. Iced tea was really refreshing though!! Also, not sure on if you clear your own tables or just leave it. There are a couple bussing stations in the dining area but didn't see customers using them. I brought all my dirty dishes up there just in case. All in all not terrible but won't frequent this place to often. Mainly just too expensive...."}
{"text":"I want to give recognition to Evan, he is by far the best most hospitable, hardworking employee you have! He is so consistent with his attitude and brightens our day!"}
{"text":"First day in AZ, first time eating here. This place is amazing. 

I ordered the V12 kale with sunflower seeds on the sue and it was so delicious! It was one of those meals that energizes you instead of making you feel lethargic after you eat it.

My friends had the Caesar salad with chicken and the soup + 1/2 sandwich with unfried chicken. The salad and soup were loved, the sandwich not so much.

You get cups for your drinks and can choose between unsweetened teas (passion fruit and green tea with guava), water, sports drinks, and sodas. There are lemons, ice, and packets of sugar available to add if desired.

The staff was super friendly.

Definitely coming back here before I go back to NYC. Dying to try out the superfood bowl, sweet potato and grilled cheese sandwiches, caramelized cauliflower pasta, and cauliflower steak. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Loved the turkey blt. They lost my order so the manager comped my sandwich.  Very friendly- I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread is on my breakfast rotation/list in Gilbert because of their consistency.

What I have tried so far:

Yummy eggs & sausage sandwich which includes, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar served on a Ciabatta Roll, Banana Walnut Pancakes with warm syrup.  One of my favorites, Organic Steel Cut Oatmeal.   Bonus:  they bake their bread daily.

Service:
Friendly and helpful, Free Wi-fi

Atmosphere:
Order your food and the staff brings your food based on the number you were provided, simple.  

Their breakfast is affordable and enjoyable -without drinks for two people, approx 15.00, and with coffee or OJ, approx 20.00 dollars.   

I love breakfast, and would love to add other breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Great manager!  Keep up the good work. Your food was delish and we'll be back to try each menu item. We are eating our way through gilbert and so far this restaurant is the the only restaurant we have be to twice in one day.  We are going for 3 meals next time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many, many times and have never had a bad experience, ever. The food is always fresh and the menu is varied enough to satisfy even my picky teen son. 

Special shout-out to Jenna, who took extra good care of us on our last visit. She delivered our food pronto and made very pleasant conversation. 

While this place is often bustling, I can nearly always find a table and there is little waiting. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. My order was soggy and disgusting. Messed up my order and for a 13$ salad (insanely overpriced) I'd expect perfection. Not a soggy disaster. I'd expect that quality at mcdonalds but for the price here, you're better off going anywhere else. Won't be returning. The quality has gone down and it seems like prices have gone up. With all the options at the chandler mall don't let this one be your choice."}
{"text":"Passing through skyharbor on the way to Portland we stopped at store 17 in the airport and got outstanding service from the staff at this location Samantha, Edgar, and Jayme, they went above and beyond for us making our experience much better than it could have been and the food was excellent too, thank you, The Gates family."}
{"text":"Whenever we don't know what to eat, this is always the place to go. We can alway expect friendly stuff, clean place and food."}
{"text":"The vegetarian tomato basil soup is a musttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!! Omgg, do iiit.. Deeelissshhhhh.

My roasted vegetable sandwich was awesome. The sauce they use is a bitter sweet taste. It was yummy, it went perfect with the tomato basil :)

Their baked chips is the best chips I ever had. :D"}
{"text":"This is a quick, easy neighborhood restaurant with good food...and tonight I had a very lovely experience there.  My daughter ordered an item, we got our table card and sat down.  The manager came over to say, very apologetically, that they were out of that item. No problem, we can try a different item.  The manager made a suggestion and then took the prior item off the bill!  We really (ok, my daughter...I got 1 bite) liked the new item and appreciated when the manager came back to make sure she liked it.  Great customer service, thank you."}
{"text":"New to the area and so happy I found this cute bakery/cafe. Food was delicious. I ordered the triple decker club and my husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. So good!!!! The employees were all so nice and definitely accommodating with our little ones. Love that this place is kid friendly as we will definitely be back often! I can't wait to try more options on their menu. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch! I always love coming here! The food is always fresh and this is my healthy to go place! 
I ordered the Chipotle Spinach Plus Salad and a bowl of Potato Cream Cheese Soup! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here was mediocre at best. For being a bread company I was extremely disappointed as the bread we got was stale. Our sandwiches and soup were meh, I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow. So slow. Ordered a breakfast sandwich for myself and a muffin for my daughter. My daughter finished her muffin and we waited another 10 minutes.  It wasn't particularly busy."}
{"text":"The food has s natural taste.  Wildflower seems to use fresh ingredients.  They mainly offer soups, salads and some pasta dishes.  There are also some desserts too.   I like the 5 or 6 daily rotating soups.  They have a nice patio to set and enjoy nice weather but, probably not a good idea in the summer.  This wildflower location has some real interesting art work on the ceiling."}
{"text":"Laura was amazing!! I have such a restricted diet she was patient and super helpful and most important did all with a great smile!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and paid for my meal. Sat down only to be told 5 minutes later they were out of croissants. Very disappointing not to get what you want, the sandwich wasn't the same and lacked flavor. Broccoli cheddar soup was meh. Friend had the braised cheddar which was tasty."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location and the one in Goodyear. Great friendly service. Food is excellent. I love the Rosemary Chicken Linguini & the Turkey Breast & Brie."}
{"text":"Always great service when we go in.  The food is excellent and great selection of sandwich's, pasta and salads."}
{"text":"Had a coupon so decided to have lunch at Wildflower. The food was pretty good, similar to other specialty bakeries. The cashier was not super friendly, but the manager was. Would go back, just felt that nothing overly stood out about this place."}
{"text":"Had the BLT Plus. While it was fairly tasty, mainly due to the great bread, it was the saddest BLT I've had in a long time.  Maybe 2 slices of bacon, mostly on one half of the cut sandwich, couple of slivers on the other side. The \"avocado spread\" looked like a couple of tbsps total, only on the middle of the bread - a good three qtr inch was dry all the way around. Finally, the chips, while also tasty, were all crumbs from the bottom of the bag. In contrast, the person I was eating with, had a huge pile of roast beef on his sandwich but had to scrap off the massively slathered on mayo.  It didn't appear that anyone looked at or cared what these dishes looked like - sad."}
{"text":"We arrived for an early flight and are happy that Wildflower was open. Ordered coffee and a Breakfast Sandwich. They readily substituted the multigrain for the Brioche no problem. Plentifully bacon and egg. The coffee was flavorful too.  Personalized service, you order at the counter but they bring it to your table. Great staff and service. Reasonable prices too. An oasis in the airport food desert."}
{"text":"An okay place for a quick bite, I had the portobello picnic sandwich, though it was tasty the bread was soggy and kind of ruined the eating experience. 
Location is awesome,  across from the rail road park."}
{"text":"I was a bit chilled and needed to warm up so I ordered some of their lemon chicken vegetable soup.  It came piping with a slab of rustic bread which, buttered, was all about F*CK CARBS, gimme gimme gimme.  OMG.  For under $5, this thing pretty much saved my life.  I'm going to want that every single time I'm sick and not feeling well.  I need the Wildflower Bread Company to expand into Nevada and California, please!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh like flowers, this is a perfect place to eat or pack your food for the long flight. They have some amazing range of sandwiches, bagels, soups n bakery products. I tried their vegetable Quinoa salad and a nine grain bagel which were quite gud. Also their, chocolate chip scone was quite delish."}
{"text":"I don't know what they do to the bread here but it's so addicting and great. In fact it's the best bread I've ever tasted nobody compares to this place. 

So far my favorite menu item is Gorgonzola Pasilla Chile Penne with the garlic bread. I've probably been here 15-20 times and I've never had any issues with the place and in fact they just seem to be getting better each time I visit."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch the other day.  I had a grilled sweet potato sandwich on focaccia.  Delicious!  It was big, so I had the rest for dinner.  I would definitely order that again!  Guy at the counter seemed like he could care less, but I suppose he was over the holiday rush.  Still it seemed like he was very unfriendly."}
{"text":"I love this company! I have always been treated well here. The staff is nice and the food is good. It's very crowded, but the staff will work with you to find a place to sit and the food always comes quickly. 

They are also very kind to vegetarians. I have not gotten sick from cross contamination here at all and they are great at separating. It is good for individuals and groups! 

The music isn't blaring but nice and comfortable! The atmosphere is very nice. I recommend this place for sure! Their cheese ravioli is amazing as well as their Mediterranean salad!"}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious and the customer service is exceptional for not being  your traditional sit down kind of restaurant. I've come for breakfast (bans walnut pancakes are worth cutting an elder in line for) and their breakfast sandwiches are bomb too! I LOVE their broccoli soup....I love everything here. The employees are nice and especially hector! He's super attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"Very unorganized and can be a bit of a hassle on the weekend.  

I don't recommend the Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich.  I swear something changed with this sandwich, as I remember having this about a year ago and it was delicious but not this most recent time.  No fig was included and the sweet potatoes were an odd texture."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with their herb bread.  It's a tasty sourdough loaf filled with fresh herbs, but not so \"herby\" it can't handle sweet applications.  It's great toasted and topped with cranberry goat cheese.  At $8 a loaf I don't buy it often, but it is a favorite treat."}
{"text":"This is the best wildflower location in the valley!!!! The other locations do not even compare in terms of quick service and hospitality. Pick up is an awesome option as well. I often order a complicated sandwich for my picky brother and they have never messed it up! Not only that, but they recognize my order and know my name upon phone call. They even wave when I arrive. Excellent service!!! The chicken pesto pick two with wildflower salad is my go to-until holidays roll around and the beefy mashed potato sandwich becomes available and it is a MUST TRY! Soups are also great on a cool day-huge portion even for just a side. Do not even waste your time on Panera bread."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service. Fresh food. Clean restaurant. The fun offerings for the holidays are so great for those of us far from home. The day that they opened n the west valley was one of the greatest moments I have had in phoenix. Get the wildflower chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"First time here and the cashiers Brianna and Brandon gave the best customer service!! They were so prompt and kind taking our orders, def will be going back!"}
{"text":"The new trend is eateries seems to be a \"Bread Company\" in one form another.  Moving here from Fort Lauderdale where we had Panera Breads I was familiar with the concept and am a big fan thus far.  

Wild Flower has a great selection of breakfast as well as lunch items, wraps, sandwiches and pastries as well as coffee and other drinks.  Try the iced teas, they are the best!  There is a sampling platter of \"the bread of the day\" on the counter and they always seem to encourage you to try it, slathered in a wonderful butter which is near by.  This alone has prompted me to purchase loaves of bread to take home as the sample was so incredible. 

On my recent visits while Christmas shopping, I found myself outside at their wrought iron tables enjoying a cappuccino and some pastries.  It always appears and tastes fresh and has far too many calories but that makes no matter, I eat it all anyway.  

My office has done lunch days here where they will buy lunch and this is where they come.  The sandwiches are amazing, huge and beyond filling.  There was a seasonal sandwich which was like Thanksgiving dinner between two slices of bread...AWESOME!!  The Roast Beef and Gorgonzola is my most recent favorite!

When my mom was going thorough her cancer treatments, I would stop here and get her a cup of soup and she did nothing but rave about how delightful it was every time!  Try the Potato Cream Cheese or the Vegetarian Corn Green Chili Bisque.  

When you stop by, do it with the intention of relaxing for a bit.  Their service is great, the food is delicious, why rush though that. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great manager!!  Realizing I had a cane & needed assistance getting my items back to my flight gate, he bagged everything up and then offered me a pastry, gratis!  Exceptional attitude, great spiritred, another reason I love coming to this place! Oh, and the coffees pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"My family loves eating breakfast at Wildflower on the weekends.  The French Toast, sausage, oatmeal, bread, breakfast sandwiches, etc. are amazing.  It is very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Our order was messed up and the manager took really good care of us got our money back and remade the sandwich. Very professional and will be coming back"}
{"text":"First time here to meet a friend that loves this place. The food choices were many. The food was good. The manager made a great suggestion that I ask that the music volume be adjusted so that I have a greater dining experience next time I was there."}
{"text":"Wildflower is a chain found throughout Arizona. I ordered the Vegetable quinoa salad which was OUTSTANDING! They ran out of kale, so I substituted it with spinach. There were so many elements to it: light,  refreshing, filling and under $10! The dressing was a light tangy vinaigrette..I'm not sure what was crunchy..carrots? Corn? Celery?almonds? Jicama? But it was perfection ..and I would  definitely order it again!

Since my flight was delayed, I made a second stop in and ordered the mocha frozen drink-made a few alterations: no whip, light chocolate syrup, decaf espresso and substituted the chocolate milk with soy milk (at NO EXTRA charge)!

It's a small place but they have charging stations at their high tables (if you're looking for a place to juice up your phone or computer).

Great place and great staff! I'm glad Wildflower was available as a healthier option amongst the Taco, burger, pizza, and Panda Express within the terminal."}
{"text":"Everyone at work is talking about this restaurant with such praise, but i just ordered from them and wasn't really happy with my food. I got my money back, but I guess this just isn't my type of food, I don't know. I don't understand the combination of ingredients. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and there was blue cheese and slaw in it. So strange to me, I understand they're being creative, but this isn't my thing. Bread was hard as a rock, had to pull it out of my mouth to tear it. Oh well guess I'll stick to the basics! Customer service was good."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved when they had their breakfast special, buy one get one free. They have healthy options too and everyone there is super friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, always great.  They are usually busy so be nice and get to know the staff, they always want to do more for me. I love the chopped salad. Breakfast is always good too"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place and much better than Panera. Tried the lemon pancake....mmmm very good. Also had the portabella sandwich....too much on tomato but still good. After eating my gf let out a big burp in front of everyone.....well done. 
They have some breads that you can buy here as well."}
{"text":"They're always so nice here. Bring a jacket for indoors but food is always Delish. Don't care for the potato salad. Chicken soup is Delish and so is the Reuben sandwich"}
{"text":"I love Wildflower. I bring my granddaughter here all the time. She is 17 and LOVES soup. We both pretty much agree that Wildflower has the best soup around. Of course I also love the artisan bread. The restaurant is always immaculate and the staff always pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"They're kind of pricey and I don't think the food or baked goods are spectacular.  The service is what keeps me going back.  I was a regular at a competitor for a long time, but had so many rude interactions that I branched out. 

The food is always fresh with generous portions here. I don't feel like a burden when I stay and study with their free (and reliable!) wifi, refilling my beverage for hours after I'm done eating.  

After 20 years in the customer service business, that's now a hot button for me. If the food quality here dropped, I'd still return.  There always seems to be a manager running around.  I'm always greeted and have a friendly ordering experience.  I now have a favorite staffer there, Hector, who seems to enjoy interacting with customers and vice versa.  I've never felt inclined to tip here or at similar places until I met him.  He provides service that I expect at finer dining locations, whereas it's a pleasant surprise here.  

Really glad to have found this spot and will be a regular fixture there!  Great for groups or dining and studying alone."}
{"text":"I waffled on my rating because I have some issues with some things here. Issues: Slow - it took over 10 minutes to make my sandwich. Soggy - the recommended bread was soggy.  I left a good portion of it behind because it was wet and blah.

I gave them 5 stars in the end because this was the best darn Chicken Parmesan sandwich I've ever had.  The guy taking my order recommended I get it on the Rosemary Sea Salt bread instead of the Cibata bread it comes with standard.  FABULOUS recommendation except the soggy issue noted above.  For flavor though... YUMMMM!  Next time I think I'll get the bread on the side or on top - an inverted open face sandwich, hmmm...  No matter, this sandwich was the bomb, even the shrooms and spinach was yummy (not so fond of shrooms).

I'll be ordering this again!"}
{"text":"Excellent little spot in Terminal 4 for breakfast!  I ordered the spicy Chipotle egg sandwich.  Delicious!

FOOD: 5/5
I ordered the spicy Chipotle egg breakfast sandwich. Scrambled eggs, sausage, feta, slow roasted tomatos, spinach and Chipotle sauce on a grilled brioche roll.  6.99

Made fresh to order and unlike typical airport food, this place gives you your money's worth. The sandwich was filling, the ingredients, fresh.

AMBIANCE/DECOR: 5/5
Open seating with both high tables and normal table seating.  The high tables provided plenty of outlets which were a huge plus if you needed the extra time to get a quick charge while eating.

SERVICE: 5/5
Excellent staff who are extremely friendly and attentive.  As customers waited around for.their orders, staff members would be aware of those that have been standing around for a while and would kindly ask for their numbers to ensure their orders were being taken care of.

COST: 5/5
For being an airport establisent, I was quite surprised that I wasn't feeling like I was paying an arm and a leg for a meal.  Especially given the quality of the food I was pleasantly surprised. Most items can be purchased under $10 and again, the portions are generous.

I will be making this my go-to breakfast spot from now on.  I cannot wait to try their other foods."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new and ordered the spicy chorizo frittata. It was well prepared and delicious! I appreciated the friendly service and the manager Frank was kind enough to make sure my order was correct and if I needed anything else. Will definitely be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Loved their taylor ham and egg sandwich! One thing about this place is the food isn't greasy or made you feel disgusting after wards as the serving was just right."}
{"text":"My mouth waters every time I think about coming here. For sure better than Paradise Bakery. I had a chicken pasta and soup that was to die for! I loved it, and for the pricing, I was pleasantly surprised! I think I paid under $15 for both of those in full size plus a drink. It could have been a sit-down restaurant! I've only been here once or twice, but all of my friends have gone mulitple times. I know what I'm doing for lunch soon!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We finished eating meal and they came by to collect our trash and asked if we wanted a refill for our coffees. Super polite guy. Totally unexpected for an airport fast service place. Thumbs up guys! Great job."}
{"text":"I discovered this Wildflower at Seville location after my cycle class next door.   Frank, the  manager is nothing short of AMAZING!  He is always professional, hospitable and friendly! He bends over back to please the dining guests. Coming from NYC we sometimes can be hard  to please. The food is wonderful! And this Seville location is spotless! My mom being a retired health inspector gives a big thumbs up and firm stamp of approval! Keep up the great work Frank!"}
{"text":"I came in for my fathers day loaf of bread yesterday, employee Mariah greeted me and wished me a happy fathers dad! I had lunch with my family, the food was excellent, my favorite is the turkey pastrami.  We love this wildflower location. The manager Pat is alway very friendly,  they have great service and food!"}
{"text":"Wildflower really is a fantastic place and I feel a bit bad giving them only 4 stars. 

Let me say up front that this is a place that I go frequently and I love. However, they have some great food and some...not so great food. 

If you like soup, try the Potato Cream Cheese.....even my husband, who's definitely not a soup fan, loved it. It's even better when you get it with the sourdough bread....it's comfort food, what can I say? Their sandwiches are mostly good. There's a few duds in there that I can't stand. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetarian one, it just tasted off to me and was a bit of a different combination of ingredients. Also, their Brie and Ham Frittata? I ended up searching around in it for the bits of ham and egg...I love brie, I just figured out I don't love it in a frittata. 

All in all, it really is a great place to go. My husband lives for the braised beef sandwich when they have it and their desserts are fantastic - you can't go wrong with anything in the magic glass case up front!

Plus, the Tempe location is right beside Changing Hands - it's like a two for one deal! :-)"}
{"text":"Chessy is the best manager ever. She took care of me and gave me the best customer service. She went above and beyond, more than I would have ever expected. This means more to me that the quality of the food. Of course I will say the food is delicious. My favorite salad is the chopped salad with chicken, soup is the cream cheese potato and their cupcakes are yummy. Looking forward to going back :)"}
{"text":"This place is great.Super nice service, wifi and comfortable chairs to curl up in. These things make it a great place to great some homework done. Plus their soup is very delish."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. 

I had the cream cheese french toast which was too heavy and the bread was too dry. Syrup was too sweet, I know it sounds crazy but it tasted like pure sugar syrup and didn't have the \"flavor\" of syrup. My friend had the Mediterranean egg sandwich/bagel and said it was ok. 

Limited breakfast selection, don't offer substitutes or turkey options. Stick to paradise or corner bakery. Popular with the older crowd."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch spot. Food was fresh and menu selection was plentiful. The Superfood Salad was just what I needed during a long road trip. Healthy and light, yet filling. Typical to a Panera, you order at the counter, but the staff goes out of their way to deliver the food and make sure you have everything you need during the entire visit. We were lucky that isn't was a mild Phoenix afternoon, and they offered outdoor seating that was pleasant. I'm guessing this is a \"chain\" restaurant, but it still had a down to earth, not commercialized feel. I hope to visit again."}
{"text":"So much deliciousness here... Harvest Kale salad!  Chocolate chip scone!  Blackberry orange lemonade!  Chicken Parm sandwich (open-faced)!  Cheese danish!  

All of their menu items use fresh, in-season ingredients... and I have never tried an entree, sandwich, or dessert/pastry that I did not love.  

Wildflower, let me count thy ways that I love you so..."}
{"text":"This place is good for what it is. The staff is always nice and ingredients normally seem fresh. They pump the food out pretty quickly during lunch. The potato cream cheese soup is really tasty. I like their sourdough bread and butter but sometimes I feel like I can yank a tooth out with it too."}
{"text":"Took a friend from out of town here. Back home, we have Panera, which is similar to this place. Very delicious. Can get a little pricy, but I'll pay it just to eat better food. The butternut squash soup melted in my mouth. The caesar salad was delicious too. If you feel like soup and salad, or sandwich, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and a couple times for breakfast. I really enjoy the sandwiches available for lunch and I often buy some kind of pastry to take to my husband that he really loves. It has been a while since I had breakfast here in the past and I decided to stop in again today. I ordered the Ham & gruyere cheese frittata. I quickly realized that it was the same thing I ordered on my previous breakfast visit. The cheese tasted more like a Brie to me, which Is not my favorite. The potatoes and toast were good. I would probably return for breakfast and try something else. I will definitely come back for lunch because the sandwiches are sooo good."}
{"text":"I went into the restaurant and ordered a chicken caesar salad with ranch dressing to take home with me.  When I got home I found that they had neglected to put in the chicken.  I called and spoke with the manager, Josh.  I told him that I was visiting for the weekend and that I was babysitting my granddaughter and that I could not come back to the restaurant to pick up the chicken.  So, he refunded my money, delivered (to my condo) another salad, this time with chicken, gave me extra bread, two delicious cookies and a gift card. What great customer service!!  When I return to Scottsdale, I will definitely go back to the Wildflower Bread Company on Indian Bend and Scottsdale Rd.  Thank you, Josh!!"}
{"text":"Service , food , seating , wifi, everything ON POINT!!! Today was my first time here and everyone was so friendly and helpful, 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could do 0.  Done giving this place tries to get it right.  Ordered 4 things and have 4 mistakes on my order on top of a ridiculous wait. Clueless operation and average food (might have been worst blueberry muffin ever had....and my 4 year old said it first)"}
{"text":"Breakfast is still the best thing going here. After that, the place goes down hill. Changes in management haven't been the best and it doesn't feel as friendly anymore. It can get busy on the weekends, but most evenings are relatively dead."}
{"text":"Actually my first time having brunch here.  I had the onion bagel and scrambled eggs.  Pretty good. The outside scenery is awesome."}
{"text":"The best service in town! The food here is amazing. I love their BLT sandwich and their vegetable beef soup! The food comes out super fast and is always great I'm quality! The servers are always super nice and considerate!! Absolutely no complaints! Plus they have great WiFi! And the restaurant is always clean! I always bring friends with me here!"}
{"text":"Great feel to this franchise. Friendly staff, moved the line quickly, great expediter... He was careful to add the finishing touches and ensure quality. Great interactions between management and staff. They were smiling and helpful to each other and customers. Nice place to start Mother's Day, good food, large portions and clean, friendly environment. Will go again."}
{"text":"This location is becoming my favorite. Such a friendly staff every single time I visit. They always stop by the table mid meal to ensure everything is going well, and if they make any mistakes on an order they happily fix it right away. It's one of the bigger locations, so there are lots of tables to sit at, even during the busy times you can typically find a seat. I usually try the specials because they are limited time items and usually are delicious! Not sure what to try? Ask for a suggestion. They are always happy to help or suggest!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Ordered a dish, they had run out of a type of pasta and replaced it with another type without letting me know. Manager never even came over to acknowledge the problem, and then when I went to ask for a box to go they offered me a $7 gift card...my meal cost more than $7, and I didn't eat it. Food quality is always good, but just for the lack of customer service or even acknowledging when they made a mistake, I will pry avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"This place is sort of eh. I went today for an early dinner/lunch sort of deal. Had the grilled cheese, just the \"regular\" one, not the wildflower grilled cheese. The cashier seemed inconvenienced that we were there. They didn't have any tomato soup which was unfortunate but oh well, we sat down and waited. Our food didn't take too long to come out. The grilled cheese was on bread that was too thick! It was dry and cut up the roof of my mouth while part of the cheese in the middle was cold! Ick. Would have been better off making food at home. Wound up giving the other half to my lunch date. On the way out I was eyeing some of the baked things and we settled on trying the ginger biscotti cheesecake. Again, eh. The consistency was how I would imagine clay going down. I tried to eat it because at this point I was still hungry and knew I wasn't going to have a chance to eat again until 8 or so but I just couldn't do it. Wildflower did not wow me by any means, doubt I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I decided to go here for breakfast. I had the cinnamon raisin French toast and it was so good. If you go here and like French toast that is a must in my book. The atmosphere in here is clean and nice. This is a really good find for me."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but was reminded of them when I got one of their scones at a booth set up at Race for the Cure. The scones are less of a solid mass that you get at some other places, but more flaky. Very, very nice! Add some cream cheese and I'm a happy guy.

They are known for bread, of course...but if you need a meal, don't neglect the entrees. Very reasonably priced, and fare that tends to be a little different than the average restaurant. The spinach and artichoke heart lasagna that I had the last time was great.

I keep forgetting about this place for some reason...but if you haven't been, check 'em out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to try this place as it was on AZ Central's \"best of\" list.  When we walked in I couldn't believe how long the line was.  This place was PACKED.  It was President's Day around 1pm.  Not sure if this is typical or not.  

When I finally got to order my food (about 10-15 minutes in line) I tried to order a half grilled cheese sandwich with soup for the \"Wildflower 2.\"  I was told that the grilled cheese was not one of the sandwiches that was available for the sandwich/soup combo.  Strange because it's cheaper and simpler than any other sandwich, but all right, so I ordered the chicken sandwich.  

We were able to find a table outside, but now we waited about another half hour or so for our food.  While we waited I started people watching and noticed everyone here was either a senior citizen or a Scottsdale 20 something.  The Scottsdale 20 somethings of course come complete with fake tan, expensive clothes and jewelry, etc.  It is definitley an ecclectic mix. 

FInally, our food arrived.  After waiting over 45 minutes, I was sure this was going to be one of the best meals of my life.  The sandwich was a dissapointment.  The bread was extra chewy.  I'm not sure how all those old people could eat it with their dentures.  Plus, the chicken kept sliding off the bread.  The chicken was also a bit dry, and overall the sandwich just wasn't very flavorful.  

The soup I had was a vegetarian chili bisque.  It wasn't very thick, it was like they just took a veggi chili and watered it down and called it bisque.  It was tasty however.  Later though, I got the runs real bad so I don't think it was worth it.  

Overall I think my impression of this place is that it's a trendy little place that sells overpriced food to rich dummies who think it's gourmet.  I'm not sure who they had to pay off to get on AZ Central's best of list, but my girlfriend and I were both disappointed.  Personally, I'd rather go to Paradise Bakery.  They give you way more food for a better deal and their bread is soft and fresh.  I think there you can get a full sandwich, chips, drink and a cookie for under $10 easy.  And their sandwiches are much more flavorful.  But maybe I'm the weird one because there are a lot of good reviews on here for this place."}
{"text":"So.... I am guilty of eating at wildflower two days in a row. It wasn't on purpose, but when I had to get a flat repaired next door, I figured why not. I had the roasted sweet potato sandwich.... It was good the first day, but it was even better the second! Their potato salad was also super tasty. The portion was huge and under 10$....gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I went here today with my dad and my brother for lunch. I was unsure of going here when my dad first suggested it, but I'm glad we tried it! The place is a little like paradise bakery in set up (you order at the counter, seat yourself), but the food is much better and tastes less processed. My Dad and I split the chicken parm sandwich and the wildflower salad. I was glad to find out that the chicken parm has grilled chicken on it (not fried) and only one slice of bread, bringing down the calorie count significantly. Also, the sandwich had TONS of flavor as it had veggies in addition to the typical sauce, chicken, and cheese.... I would definitely order it again. The salad was tasty, but my brother's asian chicken salad was better. I like that they have all of the nutritional info available on their website...it makes it easier to determine what might be fairly healthy. Surprisingly, most of their sandwiches are around 900 calories! Made me think twice before ordering. Despite this, I will go back because the food is very flavorful. At least I know what I am eating, and I like that."}
{"text":"Mmmmm wildflower is the kind of chain you have to like.... They have fresh food for decent prices. They have fresh baked bread samples (and they're really good). I tried a couple different soups and a roasted veggie plate....it was all tasty. If you're in the mall, this is probably your best option."}
{"text":"First visit, I had the vege frittata and hubs had the Ultimate Bacon and Egg Sandwich, both excellent.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service, even offered to fill hubs' soda twice, even though not a full service restaurant, impressive!  Would come back in a future visit to Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"GET THE MAPLE PECAN PASTRY!!!!  
It's like French Toast and Pecan Pie had a steamy affair and this was the result. 
So good I bought two to take home 
Thanks for the great service Frank!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It never disappoints.  If you have an interest in a meatball or Reuben sandwich you have to try these.  The meatball has a hit of spiciness to it and the Reuben has so much meat.  They just don't look great they taste great too.  I make sure to always stop at Wildflower Bread Company on my way around AZ.  BTW hands down I would go to one of these over the other bread places popping up across the country."}
{"text":"This is one of my sister's favorite places. They have wonderful bread and also serves soups, salads and san
dwiches. The service is very good. Tonight Gavin Logan was our server and did an excellent job. Try their Red, White and Blue bread...delicious fruit filled bread. You need to go early to pick some up, almost always sold out by the afternoon."}
{"text":"Had the Reuben sandwich. It was very good but disappointingly small for $10. I would not order it again because it is very over-priced.

The service was good and the facilities were plain. 

Overall, good food but way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Lots of sandwiches to choose from, also the staff is very attentive and makes sure the customer is always first! Stop by today and try one of their delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I really like the healthy choice of foods that are offered at wildflower services quick price is a good one of my favorite spots for lunch"}
{"text":"I want to be able to leave 5 stars, but watching the melee that occurs every day at lunch, you wonder why this store isn't better prepared to deal with the volume they get daily. While waiting almost TWENTY minutes to get my to go order, I witnessed  up to 19 plates waiting to be delivered at once, multiple to go orders double boxed because tickets weren't pulled and a line of customers grow to 13 while the only two available cashiers had to take phone orders and help others in the bakery. 
Good for Wildflower for having an excellent product, but it really is time to step up the ratio of staff and maybe get some more organizational procedures in place. 
I won't be back until you do. My lunch break isn't long enough..."}
{"text":"We love wildflower and had an especially great experience at the Seville location tonight! My husband got the spicy meatball sandwich and loved it and I got my go to wildflower chopped salad which is my absolute favorite. My kiddos loved their food as well. Frank, the manager was awesome and made sure we were well taken care of throughout the meal! We will be back as always."}
{"text":"Treated like a star while wearing a tanktop at 12:10 in the morning feels good.
Fast, polite, helpful... the staff was bomb."}
{"text":"Found ourselves in the area on a Sunday late morning hungry and not sure where to eat.  Found them on yelp and decided to give it a try.  

I had a hot mixed grill sandwich since it was near lunchtime while my wife had a fritata since we hadn't had breakfast yet.  Our 2 year old daughter had some pancakes.  The fritata was the most impressive and best deal out of all three meals - though the childs pancakes were a close second.  The menu listed them as \"silver dollar pancakes\" but they were more like 3\" across and quite a few of them!  

My sandwich was good but the spicy corn medley side was very disappointing, tiny, not really spicy at all and the corn tasted canned.  The bread on the sandwich was outstanding but the sandwich was a little greasy overall which detracted from the bread somewhat.  But based on the other food we saw there and the other food at our table I apparently just managed to pick the most underwhelming thing on the menu as everything else looked incredible.  

Service was very friendly and helpful.  Our daughter knocked her OJ off the table and a worker quickly got a mop and happily cleaned it up saying they'd bring us a replacement.  However the replacement never arrived which was the one disappointment in the service department.  Didn't really expect a replacement but once they said they'd bring one I was a little upset that it didn't show up.  

If we find ourselves in the area again near breakfast time we'll most likely be back.  Not so sure I'd go back for lunch after my sandwich but would probably be willing to give them another try.

I'd like to further clarify that while my written review sounds somewhat negative that's mostly because I'm using it as a chance to explain why I felt this restaurant didn't earn a full 5 star review.  And honestly my first impression of the restaurant and the food I saw on other diners plates had me expecting it would be a 5 star review.  But I also feel to earn a 5 star review pretty much everything must be perfect.  There were many aspects of our meal that warranted a 5 star review, but there were a few disappointments that unfortunately left the overall experience somewhat lower than I would expect for 5 stars."}
{"text":"From out of town. Had opportunity to go to Ruth Chris but chose Wildflower. Delicious nutritious and healthy!!!  Friendly staff. Frank the manager went out of his way to tend to our needs. We WILL be back!!  Need a few of these in Tucson"}
{"text":"I take my family to this location because we enjoy the meals they prepare. The soups are great, the salads are gourmet and sandwiches are very good with complex flavors. 

As a bakery, can we please stop selling burned or overcooked bread?? Please? These were not sold in error, they were covered in a thick layer of white flower to hide the fact that this loaf was actually black. Wildflower, PLEASE, what in the world are you thinking?? Throw that one out... Don't let me find out when I get home that this loaf is burned and dry to the core. 

We have picked up other loafs that were quite good and we figured that a bad one slipped though. Well, another bad one slipped though but the fact that it was bad was covered up with a thick layer of flower. 

I still like the salads, and I still enjoy the soups. Wildflower, you need get your bakery in order before I bother with Any more bad bread at a premium price.

Update:  I have been back several times now, and the bread buying experience has improved greatly.  I have been impressed with every loaf. I was cautious at first but quickly came to realize they have improved their quality control to the point that we are pleased to buy loaves there."}
{"text":"This is my local Wildflower, and I've been coming here for years. There's nothing better than picking up a book at Changing Hands and walking next door to grab a cookie and some tea to enjoy it with.
I think the best thing about this Wildflower is the atmosphere. It has an established feel, it's been there for a while and everyone knows everyone. The same people are there everyday, and it's really nice. 
The potato cream cheese soup in a bread bowl is amazing. The BLTPlus sandwhich (a BLT with avocado) is my favorite, so delicious!
The only problem with this location vs. the others, is that there are limited outlets -  and I'm a big mobile office person! I need to be able to get good food, free wifi and a plug for my laptop.
I hope they eventually decide to either (a) expand or (b) add more outlets."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and each time I tell myself I'm not going to bother coming back...

I've had the Caesar Salad before, BAD.

Today I had the wildflower salad.  It was so blah and small.  Especially for the high prices.

There's always a long wait to order and an even longer wait for the food to come out.  I don't know why I bother coming back."}
{"text":"Wildflower is one of the better food options in the A and B gates side in Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. The sandwiches aren't amazing but pretty good for the airport. The baked goods stand up on their own. I walk over here all the time when I'm at this airport for the chocolate chip scones, which are perfectly buttery, with plenty of chocolate chips. My partner loves the chocolate chip hazelnut sea salt cookie here too. I'm already looking forward to my next airport trip!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice decor.  There's really nothing wrong with Wildflower that keeps it from 4 stars except the feeling that a good, but not orgasmic, take-out sandwich and 1/3 cup of potato salad (exactly 1/3 of a cup)  should not cost $8.50 after tax.
I seldom go because I always have a vague, uneasy feeling that I'm being overcharged.

Food is always good quality though."}
{"text":"After my initial 3 star review I received a message from the Manager touting the protein quantity etc etc. I've had bigger sandwiches with more meat, cheese and lettuce. There was an offer for a coupon to try again, ok nice. Was in the area yesterday and went back for another try despite having received the coupon. Still not the biggest sandwich but the bread and fillings were fresh."}
{"text":"Wildflower is my family's go-to restaurant during the weekends. My dad always gets the Wildflower Pick Two: chicken continental and fruit. My mom typically enjoys a caesar salad with chicken salad. I change my order depending on my mood: chopped salad with sweet potatoes, cauliflower masala soup, BLT+ made vegan, or pasta primavera. The pastries are delicious as is everything from the rest of the menu. Wildflower is truly amazing. :)"}
{"text":"One star based on price. $28 for 2 sandwiches, cup of soup, 2 drinks. The food tastes fine but extremely overpriced.  
 We were in the neighborhood so decided to try it for the first time. We're probably never going to go back to any Wildflower. Paradise bakery and Panera bread are better, cheaper, closer substitutes. 
 Won't be going back to Deer Valley location. They were out of multiple breads and the whole restaurant had a dirty bleach water, mold smell."}
{"text":"Great and healthy food. Service was good. And the atmosphere is pleasant.

I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wildflower is one of my go-to lunch spots. They have delicious sandwiches, soups and bread.  Some of my favorite choices are: 

Turkey breast & brie on 9 grain
roasted sweet potato (no fennel) on 9 grain 
roast beef & gorgonzola on 9 grain 
potato cream cheese soup 

Service is always friendly and fast too which really helps during the crazy lunch rushes."}
{"text":"Wildflower is awesome! The food is always delicious especially the soups. They have a wide variety of delicious  and yummy food. Frank is the manager (I think) and is upbeat, helpful, and always on top of it! I highly recommend this place for any meal of the day. Great prices, options and food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast on Sunday, June 28th. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. We were a party of 4 and enjoyed a variety of items, oatmeal, yogurt, poached eggs and bacon and the berry pancakes (especially delicious!). We also ordered a couple of cafe lattes and enjoyed everything. We highly recommend and will return when in the area."}
{"text":"love, love this place!  my favorite is their cinnamon walnut bread w/ peanut butter and house coffee.  My husband loves their lemon ricotta pancakes and sausage.  grandsons ate every bit of their French toast.  Usually my husband would take me their for breakfast after an epidural next door, but I find myself craving that toast!"}
{"text":"Wow: If this is what this chain is all about, I'd have been here years ago! First visit was today for breakfast, and we had rather low expectations (been to so many consistently poor locations like Arrowhead Kneaders; Chompies; First Watch; Fired Pie etc). 
However; we had fresh eggs/tasty potatoes; amazing toast; great jam with no high fructose corn syrup; sea salt/ground pepper blend... even smiling employees! While this management style may be considered \"old school\", it's nice to have a place that gives a shart that we can call our regular haunt now. Well done you guys :-)"}
{"text":"I truly can't think of what's not to love about Wildflower. There is alot of variety for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you can pick up fresh bread, and indulge on a multitude of sweets in the case. Food comes out fast and there are employees cleaning up empty tables very quickly. There hasn't been anything I haven't enjoyed except for the bulging belly I had from pigging out on a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting after my lunch! Y-U-M. I generally choose the pick two combo and get a half salad with a half sandwich. The ingredients seem plentiful and fresh. Today I had this awesome salad that had Alaskan salmon, corn, red peppers (I had them remove the peppers), cranberries, crumbled white cheese, couscous, sunflower seeds over greens with a pesto vinaigrette. Anything pesto and I am in. They also brought 2 servings of a generous sized bread that I dipped in the pesto dressing. Other than the bread, the salad seemed so healthy!  I spent almost $9  for lunch today but it was worth it. I just found out there is a location closer to me on 42nd St and Indian School which is going to be D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  We had wonderful salads and sandwiches.  This would be a great place to have a small meeting with snacks/lunch/breakfast.  The drinks were readily available for refills and the place was well lite and clean."}
{"text":"Original- Really yummy food. The wait and line was rather long when we came at lunch but the food definitely made up for it. I tried the roasted pepper with smoked Gouda soup and the Chicken Pesto and feta sandwich combo. This was my second trip. I will definitely be back. 

Update review 041818 - we'll my review use to be 5 stars and I have been back a couple of times and never felt the need to change my review until today. The food is still good, but the service has gone downhill. First it started when ordering my food. The cashier walked away shutting down her register before I ordered then came back and gave the impression of being annoyed that she had to take my order. I brushed it off as a bad day for her, but then when I stopped eating for a second to take a drink a guy cleaning the room flew past my spot grabbed my unfinished food and dumped it before I could tell him to stop. I appreciate that they want to keep the place clean and moving - but ASK if I am done before you take away my plate. I was not done at all and was planning to finish my food. Now that is not an option and I have a bad taste in my mouth from the restaurant that they just want people to leave as quick as possible. It reminded me of a bad TV show where the Stars didn't have a chance to eat. Not sure if I want to come back again after the double whammy of bad service.

Update 051118 - So I have not been back yet but I have to say after my last review I was contacted by the company owner who apologized for the bad service and made it up to me. If that is not a company who actually cares I don't know what is. So I am modifying my review up to 3 stars until I get a chance to go back in. Hopefully the servers have been retrained. Stay Tuned."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late dinner with my hubby after seeing a movie on date night. When I say late it was probably about 8pm when we got here. The place only had 2 other sets of people in there. Even though we came late, the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly. We opted for a Wildflower Reuben Sandwich which to our surprise came with a side of potato salad and a bowl of the potato cream cheese soup. All of the food was AMAZING. The Reuben was great and had just the right amount of ingredients to make it perfect. Sometimes you can get a Reuben places that have too much of 1 ingredient and that just throws the whole thing off. Not this one. The potato salad that came with it was probably the best potato salad I have even had. I normally don't like potato salad because it is so heavy, but this one was light and airy. Not sure what they used to bind it but I wish I could find out. It was great. The potato cream cheese soup was amazing. I had never tried it before and I loved it. I really like the tangy zip (probably from the cream cheese) that hits you at the end of the bite. The prices were decent and totally reasonable especially for a made to order handmade restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot! I haven't had anything that wasn't fantastic! A little pricey but the food is fresh and tastes delicious! It's always busy but the staff is super friendly and quick! I call ahead whenever I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Good place toGood place to get lunch and hang out with friends before going to Changing Hands Bookstore"}
{"text":"Pretty average place, similar to a Panera. My friend was really disappointed by how little tuna was on his sandwich. It was a ton of pea sprouts, but very little meat. I had a kale salad with roasted veggies that was decent, but didn't care for the Mediterranean vinaigrette. The girl taking our order was slooooooooow, but food came out within 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is fresh, flavorful, not overly oily, and inexpensive.

It reminds me of Specialty's in CA. Only the sandwiches are better and more craveable at Wildflower. 

They succeed in finding a great balance between healthy and sinfully bad for you. I feel like it's similar to my home cooking... I always try first to perfect taste, then I try to remove as much of the bad stuff as I can without compromising craveability.

I can't remember one bad thing we've tried there. You can always ask them to warm/reheat their baked goods before they are served to you, for the best effect."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast to try it out for the first time. I ordered the sweet potato & greens bowl. It came with cubed roasted sweet potatoes, greens (spinach, kale, chard, etc.), caramelized onions, pepito seeds, crumbled goat cheese, an over easy egg(s), and two thick sliced of artisan bread. It was interesting, but I don't mean that in a bad way. I love sweet potatoes and greens, so I enjoyed trying this. I, personally would have loved a little bit more goat cheese, seeds, and even a drizzle of sriracha. But again, that's my personal preference. My husband ordered the mixed berry French toast. He says it was \"ok\", and that he liked the berries and the lemon curd. The French toast was closer to bread pudding in consistency. He was expecting it to be crisper on the outside. Overall, it was alright. Not terrible. We enjoyed the atmosphere. Its inviting and everything looks delicious. Really need to try their chocolate croissant (looks SO much better than Starbuck's) and apricot pistachio danish! Will be back to try more. Could probably move my rating up to 3.5 or 4. For now I'll keep it in neutral territory."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!

Comparable to Panera, yes... but also no.. 
Wildflower Bread salads are FANTASTIC! And I'm not even a big salad person and I love them. I crave the chopped salad almost everyday, but with Tuna Salad instead of chicken... and with Pomegranite dressing, instead of Pesto.

Try it, you will crave it.
I am currently trying to figure out how to duplicate this recipe at home, since I no longer live near a Wildflower.

Only downfall is that is a little pricey. I don't like paying over $15 for a lunch (but maybe I'm just cheap)."}
{"text":"Thought I would have got more food for my money...and it's cold! A 10minute drive home and my food is cold? And it's also under cooked I've never been here and so far I'm not satisfied...."}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast sandwich. Had the chipotle egg sandwich and it was delicious. Perfect size and they have charging ports at the bar table."}
{"text":"Great food, really good prices! Cream cheese potato soup yes yes!!!!!

I like this location because it has a ton of seating. Usually at other locations it is nearly impossible to find a table, at this location I always find one.

My only complaint is that every time I have come here they only have one cashier working, and usually the line is super long to order."}
{"text":"Love the salads!! Their tea selection is great as well! You do have to catch them early or they will douse your salad with dressing until it becomes a soup. Otherwise, great."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good. Usually unimpressed with places in airports. Got a tomato, basil, feta egg white sandwich on multigrain bread.. Good flavor. Light and healthy tasting. Service was fast, which was surprising considering the line. I also got a latte. Ordered a small and got 12oz.. which was bigger than expected. Earthy flavor. Decent. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Best sandwich/bakery shop! I love the atmosphere here. Their breakfast is amazing and they have really good soups for lunch. The staff at this location is really nice and pretty quick too. Perfect place for a meeting or coffee or whatev!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for a good food experience   We love the salads and sandwiches   They go the extra mile to make your food experience enjoyable.  I love wild flour salad and add the salmon fillet warmed on top we r snowbirds in Mesa"}
{"text":"So many vegetarian options to choose from, it was difficult to decide. Narrowed down the choices between a breakfast sandwich (scrambled egg whites, feta and spinach with sundried tomatoes) and cold sandwich (pesto, mozzarella and sundried tomatoes), which I ended up ordering and requested it pressed like a panini. I only ordered half a sandwich which was pretty tiny but filling for me and cost ~$6. 

One of the most delicious sandwiches I've had in a long while! Believe me, the pics don't do the food justice. Every ingredient bursts with flavor and is just plain delicious. And the bread has a nice thin crispy crust on the outside but chewy when bitten through.

Would have loved to try the breakfast sandwich or their veggie quinoa salad or vegan/vegetarian soup options!

Honestly surprised at this airport (Note: Terminal 4) becausr it has some great foodie options: Wildflower, Olive & Ivy, Chelsea's Market, some coffee place and interesting dessert options. Try to explore if you have time to kill."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, they have the best pretzels I've ever had. I am a pretzel fanatic lol all there bread are very good too. I've yet to have anything bad there."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for their carrot cake for my friend's birthday, and it didn't taste that great.  It was on the dry side.

Also I wish their menu made it easier to figure out which items are dairy-free/vegetarian/etc.  I ordered a soup that I thought was dairy-free and it wasn't... and my stomach was unhappy."}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time and was greeted by Samantha who helped my customize my own delicious salad based on her experience.   The customer service was awesome and the salad was delicious!  I will definitely return when I'm back at this airport."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Nice people. It was pretty crowded when I went and I still got my food within a good amount of time."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and good bread.  Gives me a Panera feeling, but with definitely better quality and taste.  Tried subsequently the nine grain bagel, and that was really good."}
{"text":"Good place to come for a fast fresh sandwiches salads and pastries. It is a chain restaurant but it does not have that feel. More of a mom and pop feel with multiple locations. Food is good and above par from many other sandwich shops that they are in competition with. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is an incredible Wildflower bread Company. I love the location and how it is connected to Changing hands (one of my favorite book stores ). Last night I came with my grandma for a light dinner and it was absolutely delicious. She ordered a cup of the chicken noodle soup which comes with a side of fresh bread. And I ordered half of  chicken pesto feta sandwich and the other half Caesar salad. This was a great combination and I was pleasantly surprised with the sandwich. If you ever have room I do recommend their pastries! They are so scrumptious. Staff here is generally so nice and helpful. One of my favorite stops to make when I am in Arizona visiting!
Thank you Wildflower bread Company for being you!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning with my father and service puppy Cleo . We had such a wonderful experience ! I love this Wildflower location. We have been  eating here at this location since I was about 10 years old and it has never disappointed us . The environment is calming and quite spacious. I love the atmosphere and the overall casual ambience about it. Orders are placed at the front of the restaurant and you are then given your drinks to manually fill up and then choose your own seating. On this occasion we sat outside; the covered patio adds for nice shade and cooler temperatures.   
  Food here is brought out quite quickly so if you don't like long sit and wait restaurants this is also the place for you.  One of my personal favorite things about Wildflower is the freshness and quality of ingredients used; it honestly makes all the difference for a great meal!
 On this specific time we came I ordered half of the chicken pesto sandwich and half Caesar salad; both made exceptionally !
 So Wildflower Bread Company, I will see you next time! 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery/cafe in the area--beats the socks off Paradise, Kneader's, & Cafe Zupas in my opinion!  Healthier, more thoughtful options and greater variety of salads, soups, sandwiches, and pastas.  Their baked goods are also pretty amazing.  

Favorites include the Wildflower Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which comes with arugula, tomatoes, and several types of cheeses (including Brie!!) on one of their amazing grilled breads.  A little bowl of tabouleh or potato salad usually comes alongside as well.  Their vegetarian soups are all delicious--selections vary by the day.  Their ravioli is great--served with some epic garlic bread.  Have never had a bad salad here either.  Cupcakes and croissants are worth trying as well!  Oh, and if you're looking for a loaf of bread, I highly recommend the Rosemary Sea Salt Sourdough!

One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Wildflower! I think its near Indian Bend. The manager,  Frank is really on top of his game and very accommodating, If you need anything, Frank is your man. Lots of wonderful soups to choose from and not to worry if you are vegetarian or vegan.  My favorite are Asparagus, Vegetarian Chile or Mushroom Bisque.. The Asian chicken salad is a whole lot of salad and perfectly priced and a thousand times better than the regular chains like CheeseCake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen etc.  The bakery has a lot of choices and everything I have tried  is excellent.  Check out their rosemary herb loaf from local Noble Bread.  Chocolate Chip Scones are incredible!  A inexpensive casual place with lots of delicious food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after church.  I had been to a Wildflower in Flagstaff, years ago.  I had breakfast; eggs, two sausage links, potatoes and coffee.  The coffee was Guatemalan, and was killer good.  Eggs were scrambled perfectly.  The sausages were huge, and VERY good, but a bit too spicy for me (I'm a wimp).  I ate the better part of one sausage before I had to stop.  But the star of the breakfast was the potatoes - chunky with rosemary and sea salt.  So simple, yet SO delicious.  I will get the breakfast with bacon next time, as they serve applewood smoked.  The toast was their 9-grain, and it was so good, I bought a loaf.  And they used real butter on the bread!  This is the location we will come back to!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in to try their broccoli cheese soup.  It was really good, but we still prefer Jason's Deli's version.  This was a bit salty.  The Caesar salad was amazing...I know there's not much to Caesar salad, but their dressing was the best I've ever had.  Unfortunately, the service at the counter was less than stellar. After we finished, we stood at the takeout counter for ten minutes and were ignored, even by the gentleman who appeared to be a manager (dress shirt with their logo on it). We both wanted some of their biscotti, and I was going to take a lemon bar square home to my son. But we grew tired of waiting and left.  If it weren't for the takeout service, this would have been four stars."}
{"text":"When I went to wildflower this time, I decided to branch out and try something different from my norm. I got the chicken Parmesan sandwich and holy God above it was good. I also got a slice of the chocolate cake. If you are a chocolate lover, a hormonal woman, or some combo of the two, you HAVE to try this cake. It is dark and smooth and sooooo good. 
Wildflower has yet to disappoint me... Every time I come here, it is such a great experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our 1st time here. Vegetarian Black Bean was great (chili like). Chopped salad was sort of a knock off of Cowboy Chao's Stetson, and the BLT was pretty good. Fast service. Better selection than Panera or Paradise, but similar style restaurant. 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Wildflower Bread Co. while perusing Changing Hands next door. I tried one of their sandwiches a couple years back and wasn't all that impressed, so I hadn't been back. 

This time I had the Chicken Continental which is a grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, marinated mushrooms, caramelized onion, romaine, tomato and honey mustard on a Ciabatta Roll. I got the half sandwich, half fruit salad for about $7.50. I guess I didn't read the menu fully because the fruit salad came with yogurt and granola on top. It was actually very good and a nice surprise, not too much yogurt. Sometimes places like to drown the fruit in it. I appreciate that they use a variety of fruit (watermelon, canteloupe, grapes, pineapple, and melon). Most places like to skimp out and just give canteloupe and melon with a couple of grapes thrown in for color. 

All of it was quite tasty and more filling than I expected. I thought the bread quality was quite good and the flavors of the sandwich worked together. I went back a second time within a week because I liked the sandwich so much. Next time I'll have to branch out and try something else."}
{"text":"I usually go to Wildflower for the potato cream cheese soup. I ordered 2 bowls with sourdough bread (carry out) for the kids. I received my order and there was 1 bowl of soup with one order of bread. I informed the Manager Anthony about the situation. He gave me what I ordered and then I went home. So the kids are eating, they started complaining the soup was cold and the bread was wet, and it really was. Now because of the holiday season it is impossible to get in and out of the mall. So I had to go back to the mall the next day. I informed the manager Anthony about what happened. He was nice enough, with no questions asked, and gave me a whole new order. Now again because of the holiday, Wildflower is busy and I mean busy! And there will be mistakes. We are only humans. That is why I would like to say that Anthony the manager at Wildflower, who was running around due to the holidays, knows how to take care of customer. Great job Anthony!"}
{"text":"Good Muffin. I'll Go Back Again

I stopped in because I was craving a Bran Muffin and Wildflower had good reviews - one of which specifically mentioned the bran muffin. 

The location was convenient, parking was plentiful, service was friendly (I got my muffin to go). My muffin wasn't bad, but I was a bit disappointed that I could not get a half/caf iced coffee there, only fully caffeinated.

I tried a sample of their jalapeno cheese bread on my way out and it was delicious. 

The menu looks good, and indicates that their Caesar Salad has \"traditional\" Caesar dressing, so I'll go back again to try it"}
{"text":"Panera Bread. 

That's what I thought of when I first walked in. Wildflower is to Phoenix as Panera is to Oklahoma City, where I used to live. Yet, I wasn't quite accurate with that. You see, Wildflower goes above and beyond your typical bread company/eatery. Sure, places like Panera are great but Wildflower is in a league of its own. 

Lucky for me, I knew what I wanted right away, which is unusual when I first encounter a new, exciting array of options. I chose their chicken basil chili and 1/2 their roast beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. Both were perfect - really. The chili was festive without being overly filling, for the 1/2 sandwich was a generous portion of sourdough bread, fresh tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, peppers (so good!) and Gorgonzola cheese. Plus, their herb mayo was an added touch I could enjoy (and I usually hate mayo). 

My lunch companion ordered their black bean soup with a 1/2 turkey breast and brie sandwich. It looked equally perfect, with huge slices of brie satisfying my cheese-lovin' friend. 

Plus, the price for this pairing was reasonable - just under $8. 

My friend got a pretzel for us to share. It was definitely good, not to mention one of the biggest pretzels I've ever seen! 

In fact, I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this place. When you walk in, you immediately see their vast selection of breads and sweets. Their menu is also diverse with a variety of options. You could probably eat here every day of the week and find something new and delightful with each experience. 

I say experience because that's about what it is. You order your food at the register and get a table marker to place on your table. Shortly after, your meal comes hot and lookin' divine - really. While this is a get-your-own-beverage place, you can enjoy some of the perks of being waited on, like your food being delivered with clean silverware, as well as your plate being cleared when you finish. I like that alot. Then you can enjoy a few moments post-meal to chat with your comrad(s).

In the middle of the restaurant is this over-sized beautiful light (chandelier style) that looks like roots sprouting flowers. It's something, alright. I made the comment that I'd have that in my house, if I owned one - a house, that is.. Sure, that may be a bit over-the-top, but it's indicative of how I felt while dining here for lunch. Granted, I give my companion some credit, for I always enjoy her company. Also, she's the one who suggested we eat here. For that, I owe her - perhaps I'll spring for lunch next time (great excuse to make a return visit). 

GOOD NEWS! I think I found my new favorite place to dine when I'm craving soup, a gourmet sandwich or fresh salad. 

They also serve breakfast, have a kids section of the menu and whip up some fantastic cafe beverages, including ones that tempted me: the roasted honey cappuccino and the peppermint hot cocoa. 

I definitely need to make a repeat visit, try their different breads and indulge in their breakfast menu, which is served until 2 p.m. on weekends. I mean, c'mon, can you really resist the roasted tomato feta & egg sandwich or the lemon ricotta pancakes? I didn't think so."}
{"text":"My new favorite dish at Wildflower is their chopped salad (I substitute chicken for the salmon). It is sublime! Still loving this location. I feel they've even stepped up their customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite.
Great sandwiches and soups! 
Very fresh! Moderately priced.
Lots of variety"}
{"text":"It's about 8:30AM Monday morning and I'm getting a little anxious.  Refresh my inbox, grr still not there.  Somedays I lose my patience, I can't wait a moment longer and go to the website directly.  Ahhh the weekly Wildflower Soup Rotation.  I am a soup person and I am extremely fond of their soups here, but I have to say I am mildly obsessed with their currently on their Wednesday & Saturday rotation Forest Mushroom soup.  

Okay if you are a fan of mushrooms you are missing out on the pot of gold at the end of your fungi rainbow :)  This soup has it all, wood ear, crimini, king, probably even some of those good old fashioned white buttons too, in a rich, slightly thick, broth with a hint of wine that truly brings it to another level.  I mean the first time I had this soup I looked around to make sure I was really sitting in a casual concept lunch-driven eatery and not a white tablecloth, escargot eating establishment.

I also have not had a sandwhich or saladhere I have not liked, the quality of the food frankly still surprises me as this local chain continues to expand.  The only downside is I don't think their pastry side is as fantastic as the savory portion of their menu, but hey I will happily skip the peach muffin for another cup of soup.  

Also the Pima location is my favorite, the staff is extremely courteous, friendly and cheerful!

PS They are great with mixing soups here too and won't give you the funny face or we don't know how to do that answer you may get from other restaurants.  Try Italian pepper and the tomato soup or Chicken Curry with the Roasted Corn!"}
{"text":"Marti and I drop by here a few times a month for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
For breakfast I like the protein bowl. The portion size is adequate. The frittatas are also a popular choice. Potatoes, and bread  come with meal.
Lunch is usually a salad: chopped with salmon, or a turkey pastrami sandwich and chips. 
Dinner: salads, soups, and most sandwiches are easy picks. Fresh pie is a great finish."}
{"text":"It's a great sandwich shop to come to anytime in the day. I didn't notice they have bread bowls for their soups, but definitely will have to try next time I come in. The ingredients are fresh and they have a wide selection of bread and deli to choose from. They also have catering and pick up. The bakery seems really good to I'm not a fan of sweets but definitely tempting to try."}
{"text":"This never seemed like a place for me because it seems very feminine. But during a recent visit to the mall I must say we had a great lunch. My wife had the soup and salad and I had the meatball sandwich. The meatballs tasted great and I love the ciabatta bread that they use for it. It can be a little pricey but overall I was impressed and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my chicken salad. Huge chunks of chicken, hard to chew. Loaded with what was supposed to be sprouts but was more like stalks. A very small portion of actual chicken."}
{"text":"I think wildflower is SO much better than paradise bakery. Unfortunate there is not many (good) paneras in the Phoenix area. Wildflower is the next best thing and with some of the options it's better. This location if my favorite because you can eat some delicious soup and get some hot tea and walk around changing hands which is connected to it. 

Everything I have ever eaten here is delicious. It is fast to order as well. Always a good choice."}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites!  Their menu is extensive and they allow you to customize your order.  The salads are AMAZING!!  Loaded with toppings!!  The dressings are delicious. I highly recommend this spot!  Salads come with a slice of bread and that's pretty tasty as well! Prices are reasonable :). Reminds me of Panera but is much better!!!!"}
{"text":"Good salads, sandwiches & soups for lunch. The Chopped Salad and Chicken with Pistachio Salad are the best. My kids love the meatballs & the bread here. The cranberry scones are delicious - flaky & sized for sharing. They are getting better about remembering all items in my salad and delivering food in a timely manner so I've upgraded my score from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat it was stopping here earlier today. Crunched for time, I picked up an Asian chicken salad and a large passion tea to take on the plane. Yummay. Great veggies and dressing. The employees were courteous, made friendly eye contact and treated us professionally. Will return next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this location of Wildflower. It's always so clean, is pleasantly decorated, and the service is always very friendly.

The shortbread cookies are to die for and I absolutely LOVE the chopped salad with salmon. It has red pepper, sunflower seeds, dried corn & cranberries, couscous, and FETA CHEESE, which is the correct cheese for a salad!!* 

*Not that HORRENDOUS abomination known as \"goat cheese\" that so many establishments try to foist upon my delicate palate.*

They also have a perfectly tasty pasta menu after 3pm every day. 

I only wish they allowed for online ordering so I didn't have to wait for my food during their busy lunch rush. Why is this not an option yet??? We are in the 21st century! Please make this happen sometime soon, mmmk Wildflower?"}
{"text":"Great soups! I only wish they could offer gluten-free choices so I could try something else."}
{"text":"Great local Arizona breakfast/lunch type of restaurant.  I like to get their pancakes when I am in town or the steel cut oatmeal.  Their ice tea is quite good and they have stevia sweetener packets. You order your food and they bring it to your table. They have quite a few fresh baked breads, bagles, and pastries to choose from. Free wifi and colorful decor."}
{"text":"Located in the Super Target shopping area at the SW intersection of the 101 and I-17.  Wildflower serves up amazing breakfasts that you order at the counter.  It's full service food without the tips!  Soups are great at lunch, and don't forget to take home a loaf of bread.  Prices are very reasonable, and parking isn't an issue.  

Luna Pizza a few doors down can be tempting competition though!"}
{"text":"Great soups, especially the green chile corn chowder bisque.  Salads are great as well, cold sandwiches, and breakfasts are above par as well.

Service is almost always excellent and their corporate model works well in training employees. Rarely an issue here.

Sourdough bread is great and I love the fresh loaf wedges served with soups.  The middle is soft and chewy like cotton candy, and the crust is exactly as it should be - very chewy & tough to tear with your teeth."}
{"text":"Usually pretty consistent however, took my mother in law and husband for lunch yesterday and they ordered the hot chicken sandwich on cibata bread. Bread was hard and to large for a sandwich and they had to remove it and eat without bread. Suggestion would be not to have that type of bread for a sandwich. Mine was good.."}
{"text":"I love this place! I order the buffalo chicken sandwich on the focaccia bread minus the Gorgonzola and it's amazing! They're entire menu sounds amazing. Also they're very quick. I usually order to pick up and it's ready in 10-15 mins."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the sandwich with roasted sweet potato, mozzarella, fig confit, tomato arugula, marinated fennel and balsamic vinaigrette on a herb focaccia for a long time now....although I have it made on the nine grain bread because I just don't like so much bread and the focaccia is huge. 

Now, I have a new fav! Stopped in yesterday on the way to the airport and ordered the new Chopped Salad. It comes with Salmon which I don't eat ( being a vegetarian) so they offered to sub hummus or portobello mushrooms. I chose the hummus which was very tasty but the salad was totally delicious!!  It has Israeli couscous, dried sweet corn, feta cheese, craisins, red peppers,  and sunflower seeds all artfully laid out on a bed of arugula. They serve it with a pesto vinagrette on the side which is my favorite because I hate salads that are dripping with dressing.
This is a great place to get healthy, fresh food at a good price. It's an order at the counter place so very quick.  Parking is always slim if you want to be steps from the front door but there is a huge parking lot right there so really......enjoy the exercise and walk a few steps!
For vegetarians, you actually have choices on the menu. Not just one meatless option like so many other restaurants."}
{"text":"Consistent, Outstanding Quality at an affordable price!  This is probably one of the best and most consistent restaurants my wife and I have ever frequented and is a regular favorite of ours.

Almost every dish comes out tasting great and is 90% of the time hot and delicious!  Very rarely you will get cold food and if you do the staff will fix it right away for you.

I especially LOVE the braised beef sandwich and the chopped salad!  Not to mention you need to come here for breakfast!!  The soups, bakery, and desserts are wonderful as well.  You cannot beat the flavors of the sandwiches with the freshly baked bread!  They are out of this world and healthy too!

Cannot say enough good things about this place!  This is HOW a restaurant SHOULD be and is an example for all.

Did I mention that it is very affordable and you don't have to pay for a waiter (although you should tip the staff at least a dollar) even though they bring you your food?  Very family friendly as well and this is one of the very best locations right at the Chandler mall.

A+  This restaurant is a gem (truly a rare find)."}
{"text":"Huge fan, we eat lunch here weekly. Have tried every salad on the menu, all very good. Prices are ok, and service is pretty much always excellent. I did find one little hair in my salad once, just once. have forgiven them, but i never forget, if this happens again then I'll complain.  Also the biggest negative, is that on two different occasions I have witnessed the homeless walk in - holding their own cup from the street and walk straight to the fountain drink & iced teas AND TOTALLY JUST HELP THEMSELVES TO THE REFRESHMENTS AND THEN WALK OUT. Like I said I have seen this twice now and so I don't understand how the employees aren't seeing this and stopping it. I feel bad for the filthy, smelly, homeless crackies that are thirsty.. But seriously I don't know what kind of filth, bugs, fleas, ticks, dandruff, dry ashy skin cells that their shedding and dragging in with them, and the filthy hands and also their drag in their oh not so welcoming aromas!!!!!!!!!!!!! yuk. actually now that i re-read my true words I feel like changing the 4 to a 3 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh the truth hurts.  anyways yea this is factual and btw the hubby always only gets the same turkey & brie cheese sandwich - HE GOES NUTS FOR IT - ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Although I almost missed my flight because of it and had to run across the huge Phoenix airport, I walked almost the whole airport before choosing takeout from Wildflower. The guy working the counter was so nice! I wasn't sure I wanted to eat there or what I wanted. However, he was very patient and kind. He let me try a sample and answered any questions I had. I finally decided on a cauliflower masala vegan soup. It was a bad choice for a flight but yummy for my tastebuds, ha, ha... It did stink up the flight cabin, though. I also got a half sandwich of the turkey brie on challah bread. I was pleased...except for almost missing my flight, ha, ha... For airport food, this was fabulous--customer service, taste, and creativity."}
{"text":"This location is really nice!  Great layout if you need to get a little work done.  Frank is the manager and a wonderful guy!  Staff was very attentive and responsive and stopped by a few times to check on us.  I screwed up my order and got a sandwich I wasn't crazy about-Frank made a new one for me which I really appreciated!  I will drive further to go to this location after this experience because it is so rare to see a team working together that values the customers and strives to deliver great service.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner tonight at Wildflower. The customer service and friendly demeanor of Jacob Rodriguez is outstanding!  He is a good representative of your company.  His smile is contagious and he greets customers in a friendly manner.  Good job Jacob!"}
{"text":"I need to not forget how yummy wildflower is. Had the oatmeal this morning. Broke up the cinnamon raisin crouton on top. Delicious ! I wonder how yummy the pancakes are."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a potentially good place such a bad wrap.

First let me start by saying if you have dentures, you won't be able to handle this place. The bread is HARD to chew through. It cuts your gums, the roof of your mouth. I've given the bread chance after chance, to no avail. They do not make their bread in house, it's delivered by a truck. Gave up on sandwiches here.

I came back for breakfast and got their fruit bowl with yogurt, and it was practically sour. Maybe they left the fruit out too long? It's never as fresh as it should be. Gave up on the fruit here.

Again with friends at lunch I tried the minestrone soup. Salty salty salty. And served with their STALE bread!

The good thing is they have free wi-fi. And their bakery goods (cookies, cakes, brownies) are delicious. That's the only place I will give them 2 stars for (and they don't even make it!). The food itself: Blows."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful meal with top service and a smile. Great banana Walnut pancakes! Lunch and dinners are healthy and coffee is always fresh even in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Big thanks to Martin, who helped me order a salad despite my food allergies which could have prevented me from ordering any of the salads on the menu. He really went above and beyond the service I typically get in an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality food! I got the grilled cheese which came with arugula and tomatoes which was way above a standard grilled cheese.
The service was great and the biggest perk, CHARGING PORTS all around the seating area. Hard to find outlets at this airport so this place is great to eat and charge at the same time"}
{"text":"Decent airport food that's not the same as the rest.

I had the chicken BLT....not bad. Had some sort of zesty guac on it."}
{"text":"The customer service is always great. The restrooms and dining area are always clean. I love the coffee and the potato soup is so delicious."}
{"text":"I loveeeee all of their food, because of the fresh menu.  Portions could be a bit bigger at times and it can be a bit expensive, but I still enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good. I am not really a sandwich person so this is not my favorite place to go. But it is a good option for lunch while at the Chandler mall. The sweet potato sandwich is my favorite and I also really like their soups and pastries (good for breakfast too, scone and a coffee, yum). I agree with Lynn W. that this place is much better than Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"I love Wildflower, I've eaten there at different locations. Always clean, excellent service, delicious menu, ample serving sizes so the price doesn't feel too high for what you're getting. I wish Panera was this good."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh, it smells delicious. I ordered my food to pick up and it was ready right when they said. The staff were so helpful. I had the BLT Plus with a Caesar salad, amazing! My boyfriend had the triple club, pasta, and italian wedding soup and he loved it! This location is connected to a cute book store next door with little gifts and new and used books. Definitely going back soon for a sit down lunch!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! I've only ever had a great experience here. The staff is amazing and always friendly, the food is great and filling. I've been coming here for years and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"There could not be a sweeter/kinder staff in the Sky Harbor Airport than this team. Whatever their management is doing, they are doing it right  as their customer service is above and beyond. A special shout-out to Samii for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Always good food but they must not get a lot of to-go orders. You can only pick up on the side at certain times otherwise you have to wait in line, and sometimes you are standing there waiting for someone to help you. I know the lines here get very long, that's why I call in ahead and want to be able to grab and go but it's always a running joke in my household with how long it takes to get food here. Also sometimes the to-go orders are packaged sloppy or not nearly as nice looking as if you would get it when dining in. Staff is okay. Food is great though, worth it."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food 
1 star for the customer service

Lady with curly reddish brown hair kinda chunky was working the cashier and yelled at her coworker right in front of 3 customers. Very rude to the gentleman in front of me and to my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Great salads , bread, and tea. I always get the house salad and my hubby gets the Waldorf salad."}
{"text":"First time going here. Will not being going to this or any other one again. Had an over priced sub-par roast beef and Gorgonzola sandwich. Was also told that the wait would be 20 minutes for my food and it turned into nearly 40."}
{"text":"I work right in the area, therefore it is my go to lunch spot. The customer service at this location is incredible. I cannot recall a time where I have had an unpleasant experience. It is a busy place to go, but they're quick and efficient. The whole dining experience is pleasant. They have outside seating as well which is nice during the cooler parts of the year. The thing that stood out to me however, is that during Mother's Day, they greeted every mother and handed them a goody bag which contained a fresh loaf of bread with a little note. I appreciate when a business goes above and beyond for their guests. The only things negative about their location is the parking, which can be chaotic, but that is no fault of theirs. I will continue to go here and recommend to all! Thanks for the great service, Wildflower!"}
{"text":"Yes, bread but -- the Turkey Waldorf salad, please!! It was so fabulous that I shopped for the ingredients and made it at home myself.  It is one big bowl of deliciousness. I can't speak to the bread, other than what comes with the salad (I'm trying to cut out bread). The bread that comes with this salad is particularly hard and I don't like that in bread...

They have sandwiches and various salads, and breads and pastries. I'd try not to come during typical eating times because you may not have a place to sit."}
{"text":"We frequent this spot for their amazing Salmon Chopped salad. They always have friendly staff and great food. This evening Frank recommended we try the new multi-grain croissant and the maple danish. We like to focus on eating heathy & fitness and these healthy sweet treats were absolutely delicious! I'd recommend stopping in and giving it a try!"}
{"text":"As always, we had the most pleasant visit/dinner at the wildflower on Scottsdale Rd. The food was delicious and fresh, the services were outstanding. Fred the manage was friendly and delightful. We'd never been disappointed. The  ambience, staffs and food are out of this world.Top choice to go for breakfast, lunch and dinner when I'm in the mood for excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cuban and it's a solid sandwich.  I also ordered a pretzel and it was a little bland so that's the reason for a 4 star instead of 5.  Great sandwiches and I would recommend."}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times and it's got good food and a nice, chill environment. Haven't been super impressed with their salads - I think it's the salad dressings I don't care much for. My last visit I tried their new Farmhouse Farro Salad and it had way too many nuts for my liking. I asked for clarification about the Parmesan herb dressing that comes on it and they explained it's actually their Caesar dressing. I thought it was funny they'd rename it to sound fancy for this salad. 

Big fan of their bread but it's dangerous! I can't not eat it if it's on my plate! The broccoli cheddar soup is also to die for and it tastes a lot like the one at Panera. Their teas come in cute little individual boxes. Haven't had a chance to try any of their desserts or coffee drinks yet but they look like they'd be tasty. 

What I like most about this location is it's connected to my favorite, local bookstore. They offer free wifi so it's a great spot to sit, read, chill or catch up on some work --or at least pretend like you are doing something while you actually people watch ;)"}
{"text":"Oh Wildflower, how I love thee. In the search for a place to soak up the AC while writting the next great american novel, I came upon this place. I saw they had free wifi and some comfy looking booths so I decided to step inside. 

There is a very distinct, relaxed atmosphere here. The crowd that comes here is very mixed but still very mellow. It also helps that this location opens up to Changing Hands Bookstore next door. Coffee, good food and books seem to go hand in hand.

Then I stepped up to the counter. My eyes were greeted with a feast of various baked goods. I looked up at the menu and was pleased with the choices available. I have had lunch and dinner here. Everything I have had as been really great. I especially enjoy their soup in bread bowls. It's a step above panera bread company for me. There is just a certain flair there. I also really enjoy their iced tea. The only criticism of this place is that there coffee can be a bit bland. Oh, and I've bought loaves of bread here too. They were wonderful.

I have spent quite a few hours here working and talking with friends. This is definately a great place to go."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Frank gave us some great recommendations since it was our first time in (visiting from out of state). Tried the BLT with avocado on sourdough, vegetable beef soup, and the Mac & Cheese. Loved the soup, so hearty and flavorful! The Mac & cheese came with a side of fruit and a cookie (it was a kids menu item) and the cookie was so good that I promptly went back inside and bought some more cookies to go!"}
{"text":"I had a bagel, pricey but not surprised it in an airport.  They initially gave me the wrong bag and they seemed a bit confused but it was super busy.  I am guessing it is always super busy though.  A new system would help them manage the tidal wave of customers.  I would go back if I was there and desired sustenance."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5, but based on convenience and proximity to Changing Hands and Trader Joe's, it gets the extra half-bump.

Delicious bread boules filled with tasty, filling soup (a meal in themselves), yummy fresh baked goods, refreshing wildflower iced tea (one of the best!) and of course, their lemon garlic pasta -- perfect balance of lemon, garlic, and ricotta cheese, with lots of spinach and tomato, plus two hefty slices of fresh garlic bread.  I have been known to starve the extra thirty minutes until 3 for this bowl of heaven.

Just be weary of going before or after Changing Hands events, or during the lunch rush or on weekend mornings -- finding a seat for once is hard, but trying to sit with your group?  Forget about it.

Also, they used to give away leftover pastries at the end of the night; not sure if they still do this, but definitely worth asking."}
{"text":"It is always so nice to eat here. I have never had a bad meal at any Wildflower. Today I went crazy and tried something not of a Chicken Salad nature.--lol-- I know shocking! I had the Sweet Potato Sandwich ( weird sounding, huh? ) and Vegetarian Lentil Tomato soup. Ummmmm, delish, delish, delish. The place is always so crowded though and you have to fight to get a table at times but the service is still very good. Everyone is smiling and helpful. I love that it is connected to Changing Hands Bookstore too. 

I took home a home made pretzel and a Ginger Oatmeal Biscotti. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's a healthy quick pick up for lunch at work or when I'm too lazy to cook. Plenty of healthy tasty options."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that there is a WBC here in Glendale because I had gone to the WBC in Sedona with my boyfriend and literally ate every breakfast there.  It's nice to come here for breakfast and just stay here for hours studying before an exam.  I love the cream-cheese stuffed toast and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  They also serve up a decent lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here quite often, just have not written a review. 
Simular to many of the sandwich shops. Clean, open layout, appealing looks. 
You order, get a number go to your table and your meal is delivered. I have many different sandwiches and soups. Everything has always been good. Friendliness? I would put them a cut above the rest of the sandwich shops."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat ever! Their food is incredible. Their pesto is so authentic and yummy! There's never been a dish I tried and did not like. I would totally recommend their potato cream cheese soup, buffalo chicken sandwich, or chicken pesto and feta sandwich! Top favs! 

The location is also very neat and clean. They have some of the sweetest employees I've ever encountered! Especially Stephanie. She has gotten to know my order and greets me by name."}
{"text":"Wildflower Bread Company

High end sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods.

Had the Tomato Basil and Spicy Meatball Sandwich. The tomato basil soup also came with a couple good chunks of sourdough bread, the soup was awesome. As for the spicy meatball sandwich which is on a fresh chibatta bread which was firm enough to hold the meatball and sauce  but tender enough to eat. The meatball sandwich had a little kick to it with the peppers but not overly spicy.

Restaurant was extremely busy as we ate there on a Friday around noon but everything was prompt and smooth."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean restaurant with a good variety of items which include baked goods, breakfast, sandwiches, soup and many other dishes.

Tried the spicy meatball sandwich and the half turkey sandwich and soup. Requested the hot peppers not be and hence not spicy, but excellent sandwich. Served on a baguette that stands up to the marinara sauce with a generous amount of meatballs.

The turkey sandwich is refreshing especially on a hot day in Phoenix filled with a good portion of meat and condiments. 

Large variety of different items and a self serve drink dispenser."}
{"text":"This new location was great. It was packed, which is a great sign. We sat outside at sunset, which felt like we were at a resort. Wow. They've got a few good, local brews on tap -- yay! Great to see a local AZ business doing well."}
{"text":"The one in Gilbert has very good service, they staff is great. The chicken noodle soup is good but a lot of salt, noddles and little veggies and chicken.
The best is the Wild Flower Salad, yummy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with my wife.  I totally enjoyed the tomato feta & egg sandwich.   Fresh and made to order.  The service was excellent.  Amy was a great server.  Pleasant and very attentive.  OJ was great too."}
{"text":"The food is very bland and far from fresh, pastries are as hard as a rock and the soup is like watered down Campbell's? soup from a can (which is actually better) and? coffee is tolerable. The last time I got an iced tea there was a pink hair in it. Looked over and what do you know? The unfriendly worker who was making the drinks has pink hair. Then I noticed only the ones in the very back are wearing hair nets while all the rest of the grumpy Wild Flower staff has their hair down and all over the place. Not to mention? chipped nail polish and dirty uniforms. 
  
     Unfortunately that is the only place to grab a coffee (all I'll ever get from there) before you board a plane around A9-14. Otherwise, allow time and go elsewhere in the airport to avoid this place."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here.  Some nicely put together sandwiches but not a lot of overly impactful flavors.  The bread is fresh and soft at least."}
{"text":"Finally!! Food that looks like their picture. I walked into the wildflower today for lunch after church and there was a sign that was advertising a Reuben sandwich. It looked really delicious on the picture so I ordered it. I came looking exactly like the picture and it was tasting phenomenal. I have to say is the best Reuben I have an a very long time. The bread was seeded rye that was crispy and light, there was a lot of corn beef and just enough Thousand island dressing with sauerkraut. I hope it's not a seasonal item, because it's something I would like to have again"}
{"text":"Good, but there are better restaurants in the area (for lunch).  It's popular-trendy to go there if you work in the area.  I avoided this place because there were ALWAYS people from my office here!  Their selection is great, but their employees didn't want to go the extra mile AT ALL.  I got a dirty look asking for a side a certain way.  Not very healthy either.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just totally over the whole concept of bread companies."}
{"text":"I love wildflower but today I went in for a bagel and muffin to go. It took them over 10 minutes to make ( they were not that busy) and it was totally charred when I opened the bag at home."}
{"text":"Met here on a Sunday morning to see my sister and new hubby off on their honeymoon. I was expecting a bagel shop kind of thing but they have an entire breakfast and lunch menu along with all kinds of bread, bagels, muffins, cake, and all kinds of other goodies. There were 7 of us and everyone left very satisfied. I only had a muffin and a few bites of the potatoes, but there were pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sandwiches around the table and everything looked great. And huge! Big portions here, I don't think anyone actually finished their entire breakfast. 

You have to try the potatoes! They're kind of diced and seasoned and then pan fried and man are they good! 

This is Scottsdale dah-ling, so of course it was super nice and clean. If you don't drive a Benz, BMW or Audi they might impound you, so watch out ; )"}
{"text":"Not only do they have amazing food but the server Jacob who helped me was the kindest and most genuine person i think i've ever talked to it totally brightened my day he deserves a raise!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ice cofffee, love the breakfast menu but not so much the rest of the menu. As for anything else, the service seems friendly enough."}
{"text":"I had the wildflower combo cream potato soup and turkey brie...I have no complaints!
Walk up and order and the server brings it to your table..the price was very reasonable for healthy, quality ingredients!
Anyone that complains about the quality and prices are just gonna complain about everything!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and the service is fantastic! I lalalooove the Chopped salad- sub Chicken (smoked salmon is great too) Mmmmmmh. The arugula (actually all the veggies) are always fresh and portions generous. The balance of this dish with the feta then sweet from the cranberries and then crunchy, dried corn along with the sunflower seeds are just brilliant. And then there's the delicious bread (don't be afraid to ask for a different type) along with the amazing pesto dressing that accompanies the dish...mmmh. Seriously AMAZING.  I took half of it home because I also decided on a cup of thier Mushroom soup.  YUMMY.   Anthony, one of the managers, was wonderful and provided excellent customer service today. Very kind and has a strong desire to please. A sweet girl named Taylor was also very attentive and came back to our table several times to remove plates and grab us some to go containers and bags- super hard working girl- it was totally appreciated. I haven't tried too many things as I can't find myself to venture away from the Chopped salad but from what I am told, all thier food is great. Try them out. =)"}
