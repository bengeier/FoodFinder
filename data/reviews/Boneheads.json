{"text":"Impressed with the quality of the food given that its quick eats healthy food. The greek salad is huge and tasty. Ohh for greek salad snobs sorry this is not a greek salad that does not actually have salad buy great nonetheless. Nice fish sizes with your meal, for the price, I had the salmon very good. If you like deserts I tried the key lime pie (don't do it, I swear it was a edwards frozen slice thawed). Overall good place for the people who care about living longer and for those who don't it tastes good so try it anyway."}
{"text":"First visit. Met my sisters for lunch. Beautiful outdoor seating.  They each had a salad with different toppings, I had the small plate, a large shrimp skewer with a generous portion of rice topped with black beans and rice and a grilled zuchinni. Staff was friendly, food was fresh and delicious. Generous portions, delicious food=good value!"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to try this place out? This place is wonderful in a lot of ways. They're carefully tucked away in a usually busy shopping complex, right next to a beautiful fountain, I would eat outside if it wasn't 98 degrees in Charlotte now. It's a lot more of a fast-foody feel which I do like because it's quick and casual, but I do sometimes wish the decor was a little more inviting (that might just be a personal thing). But I think it would move it into a dinner type of place. I'm not sure what exactly they could do though...  Their special plates are the real gem that I zone in on. It's so inexpensive for such flavorful stuff! I've tried their tacos and I will always get the fish ones because they are so well seasoned! The fish is so flaky and soft, while the taco itself is usually well toasted to soak up the yummy sauces. The greens in the taco are also unusual but very welcome I LOVE cilantro and the rest of that cabbage-carrot-mix! I've also had the pleasure of trying the 1/2 chicken and the chicken plate with hot sauce. Those are also quite satisfactory. Not to mention the 1/2 chicken is massive. It does not even fit in a to-go box very well. There are little drum sticks poking out of the box. Ha! The grilled zucchini is also a winner.   I don't really think I can rave enough. I think everyone should go here for some inexpensive and tastey food! They are pretty quick at to-go orders as well. I went in there when it was quite busy (just now) and they got my two dishes to  me in about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but you get good value for your money here. The fish and chips were pretty good, but I was less impressed with the chicken. Soaked in sauce on the outside, but dry and kinda stringy inside. They've got a nice atmosphere for a quick and relatively cheap meal though, and I'd go back (for the fish)."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place. It's good. Real good. I rarely get fish but I do here. I love the mahi with the pineapple salsa. They have great chicken, too. I won't bore you with a repeat of what others have already stated. Just go. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. I had the Mahi Mahi and my wife had the Salmon, which were both awesome! The service was quick and friendly. Looking forward to going back to try something different!"}
{"text":"We tried boneheads for the first time after I found a coupon. The food was ok in my opinion. Nothing to write home about. If I had no where else to go I would consider going back. The staff was friendly which made the experience more enjoyable. I had the grilled shrimp with pineapple salsa and rice."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place.  The salmon is what we normally get and it is always cooked exactly like we want it..it is truly perfect every time. The sides are yummy, with the grilled zucchini being a favorite! The staff are wonderful and it's always a pleasure to eat here. I also have to mention that we get carry out from them as well and it's always top notch. I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our super tonight at Boneheads. The half piri-piri grilled chiken, rice and steamed broccoli was mouth watering. My dear wife had grilled salmon, rice and Asian coleslaw. Everything was fresh and tasted great. We will definitely return when we are in that area. The owner was hospitable and wanted to know if we enjoyed our meal. Try it. You will love it."}
{"text":"Favorite place to visit in charlotte for a great lunch, or dinner! Fast service, great good and the place is always clean. Definitley 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been one of my favorites for several years. But the last two visits have been disappointing. My favorite meal is the House Salad with Salmon. The Salmon is always cooked perfectly. Moist, not over or underdone. But the salad has gotten below what is advertised. The lettuce is not a mixed green mix, it is just large, old romaine lettuce, in big unappetizing chunks.   On my last visit, there were no tomatoes or cranberries in the salad . A HUGE disappointment!! as this was one of the really special parts of this salad.  I really hate to watch a restaurant compromise quality, especially when they have already increased the price ( although not a lot).  Sadly, Boneheads is no longer at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Our family has eaten dinner here several times and will go back because it is good food, healthy, quick and inexpensive - great value!  I have ordered the Grilled Salmon on various salads and it is always very good. The servings size is enough for dinner, but you will not feel you have over loaded. Grilled vegetables are offered on the side and they are good. I have never had desert here.  It is not a place to impress a date, but more for a family kind of outing, and certainly would be good for lunch. Service is always very friendly and helpful, you can get a beer with your meal, and it does not cost an arm and a leg, which is a big reason I gave it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey for fast food.  The food was decent though - I ordered the shrimp and grilled zucchini. I think it was just a little too pricey for the type of eatery it is.  A lot of the tables hadn't been cleaned either, so it was difficult to find a place to sit down even though the restaurant was pretty empty."}
{"text":"I really love the taste of Piri Piri grilled foods and Boneheads does not disappoint. Very casual restaurant with a friendly staff. The 3 taco meal is great to start with if your a novice to Peri Peri seasonings. Each table also has an assortment of sauces from the extremely spicy to mildly tangy. Great sides to accompany some tasty entrees. The salmon with rice is amazing. If you like grilled meats or veggies with a little kick, this is a place you gotta try. Great location in the Stonecrest Shopping Center with prime outdoor seating. Free wi-fi too if your stopping in for lunch and need to do a little work. I'm a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh, fantastic food for not a lot of Fivers! Made right there on the grill as you come in so you can see it!  You come in, you order, you find a place to sit. Inside or outside. Outside on the weekends there is music so it's even more bang for your buck! Great menu choices like fresh salmon & Mahi Mahi, chicken, fresh grilled vegetables, you can't go wrong here! Great meal! Great price! WIN WIN"}
{"text":"For some reason, i didn't expect much from Boneheads. Don't know why, but it turned out to be irrelevant.   Boneheads was really good, especially the sauces that you can use to spice up your fries with (they're not for the fries, but i have a tendency to dip my fries into anything that can add some extra flavor).   Also have a tendency to never make a decision on what to have, so i go with the combo plates whenever possible. The shrimp and chicken tacos were both really good, nice kick, the slaw was awesome (love cilantro) and the tortillas were a bit small but fresh and flavorful.   The interior is simple, nothing to write home about, but the food will definitely bring me back."}
{"text":"Boneheads is a pretty cool place for some really great food! What a great local find in the area!  I actually found out about this place via Groupon. They had an offer for $10 for $20 and I love seafood and I love chicken so I bought it figuring what did I have to lose!?  Well I must say I was not disappointed! When you walk in the doors you come right up to the menu and counter and the cooks are back there whipping up amazing fish, shrimp and chicken dishes right before your eyes....and that's enough to make your mouth water....because it looks so delicious!!!  So we decided to try a couple of there top favorites, the staff was very helpful with their top favs and helped make our decision much easier!  For starters we had the Bonehead's shrimp which are Crispy fried shrimp tossed with Boneheads sauce and served over cilantro slaw. The shrimp were cooked until golden brown and then tossed in to this delicious spicy and sweet sauce that was a perfect pair....they were soooo delicious! I almost wish we had a second order!  I chose the taco combo with the tilapia, shrimp and chicken....I figured I might as well try all three so I could compare and have plenty of variety! There is no issue with portion size here! All the tacos are filled with the meat and slaw and a side of your choice! The tilapia was cooked perfectly and full of flavor you could really taste the different spices they used to add extra flavor. The shrimp again were delicious, and covered in a seasoning blend and sauce mixture....the only thing I would add is some of the special signature Boneheads sauce...that would have made these tacos complete!!! Finally the chicken was really good too! Very tender and juicy! The tacos came with a side and I chose the fries, they were hot and prepared well just lacked seasoning and crunch in my opinion. Next time I would prefer a vegetable option.   My boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineapple salsa topping which has  pineapple, peppers and onions mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce. The salmon presentation was beautiful, I loved the grill marks and the taste was wonderful, it was flaky and tender and the sweet sauce added a nice combination of flavors for the fish. For the side, he selected the grilled zucchini which was sooo yummy!!!  Again, gotta love those grill marks! These are definitely a must try!   This was a great visit, I loved food and the flavors the portion sizes and just everything here was great! I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Boneheads several times over the past few years.  The food always tastes fresh and is seemingly healthy.  The problem we've run into the last few times has been the service.  The last time we went it was slow and unwelcoming and we said we wouldn't go back.  And then we ran across a coupon.  So today we went for lunch after probably a 6 month hiatus.  The restaurant felt unclean - the tables were sticky, the napkin dispenser was sticky and broken, food was sitting on a lot of tables well after folks had left.  We were there at about 1:30, so it's safe to say the lunch crowd had come and gone and the staff just wasn't picking up leftover food.  So, with food sitting around and sticky surfaces we didn't have a great impression when we sat down at our table.  Also - it's clear that they've updated the large menu board, but the menu copy that's taped to the counter in front of the register is still showing the old prices.  Details, details, it all matters when you're trying to convince me that your restaurant is where I should spend my money.  As we're sitting there waiting for our food (which IMO took too long based on the crowd in the restaurant), a young man came in wearing all workout gear, sweating and dirty.  He walked right behind the counter and into the kitchen where he was joking and chatting with the staff.  I never saw him wash his hands and he was touching the registers, counters, and the supposedly clean staff members.  He placed his order from behind the counter and with his sweaty clothes on, he waited for his order to appear in the \"order up\" area - right where the cook was preparing my lunch.  No, I'm not okay with some sweaty guy standing next to where my lunch is being prepared.  I don't care if you're the owner, the owner's son or a random employee.  You are not clean and that is a HORRIBLE impression on customers.  Our lunch was okay, but frankly, I was disgusted with the sticky surfaces and sweaty visitor to really enjoy it.    I'm afraid that what was once a great restaurant when it opened has now become a dirty alternative to what it was in it's prime.  Boneheads - if you're going to have a kitchen open to where all of your customers can see what's going on, I suggest to treat it as such.  And while you're at it, clean the tables, pick up old food and replace your napkin dispensers.  Gross."}
{"text":"I had a $20 coupon and thought I'd treat a friend to lunch. The line wasn't long but giving the order in became complicated as the young lady behind the counter couldn't get it right even after 5 or 6 tries. Finally we sat down and as we chatted the wait time became 15, 20, 25 minutes. A guy with a tray came by 3 times and I said is that order #9? He said no and walked away. The place wasn't very crowded. When the meal finally arrived (same guy) there were no chips for the Fish&Chips plates and I couldn't get them to give me oil& vinegar for my salad. I asked for tartar sauce and they gave me their own version which was far too spicy. The manager came over and apologized. Sorry, that doesn't cut it.  Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant for clean healthy eating! I have experienced nothing but positive customer service and food! And for anyone that doesn't agree .. This ain't the DMV and your food is served in the ordered it was received!!!  That is all! Carry On"}
{"text":"Ok food, a little pricey.  Frustrated that they never tell you of upcharge if you swap out the rice.  Really?  You just sneak it into my bill?  Always makes me feel like this place is dishonest.  Once they wouldn't take my coupon.  Just not sure about the ethics.  Only reason I go is because my DH likes it.  Otherwise I would pass, would rather give my money to people who are honest with their customers on upcharges."}
{"text":"My wife suggested we try this restaurant. We expected a regular place with a wait staff. But, you get in line at the counter and place your order and someone brings it out when ready. They have self-serve drink fountain. The lady who took our order was very pleasant and full of good information about the meals. I had the Mahi-Mahi, and my wife the Tilapia. Both were well prepared  and delicious. The prices were very reasonable. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with Groupon in hand, but alas, they are stone-cold outta here.  Closed tighter than a bank after hours.  It appears forever since deconstruction has started with no signage about their future.  On a positive note, had a great lunch at Flying Biscuit next door!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! I ordered a house salad with salmon. The salad is huge (could easily be shared) fresh and delicious! The salmon has an amazing flavor and oh so tender!! I've actually had this salad several times.....I am determined to try something else next time.  It all looks so good!!!  This place is a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed with this place as far as the food goes!! I had the salmon with the grilled zucchini.  It was well cooked and tasted pretty good to be honest. For what this place is it came as a pleasant surprise.  The restaurant itself was rather dirty though and that prevents me from giving it anything higher than 3 stars.  However for fast and seemingly somewhat healthy lunch this place works."}
{"text":"The food is great and very tasty. The service is a bit lackluster, with the staff taking quite a while to get your food out to you. Overall, it is very worth the wait, though. They have live music on occasion and a patio where you can sit and eat. Prices are a bit high but not unreasonable. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Boneheads, Boneheads... I must have reviewed it somewhere along the line!  But search as I might, I have NOT!!  Until now!  I've actually eaten here quite often.  And, there's a reason for that - it's good.  Well two reasons - it's also pretty healthy food (in comparison to MANY other options).  So Boneheads (in the Stonecrest Shopping Center) has several positive attributes:   First, they serve fish - several varieties too.  Mahi, Tilapia, Salmon, Grouper, Tuna and of course, Shrimp!  We are fans when it comes to fish!  AND much of it is offered grilled!!  Even better!  Tonight, I had the Tilapia and it was excellent! Okay, they also have baked chicken - I've had it; it's good too!  Second, while it's not exactly \"fast food\", you DO get your food quickly.  So I think of it as \"swift food!\"  Third, the sides... again, several healthier options!!  Grilled Asparagus, Grilled Zucchini, Sweet Potato Fries, and now they've added baked sweet potatoes!  These, of course, are offered among several other options.  But, I need to mention that we ALWAYS start with the Boneheads Shrimp appetizer.  This is one good dish!!  The Shrimp is fried (okay, a little won't hurt!) and coated with their sauce and served with slaw. (1/2 order of the shrimp is about 250 calories)  If you know what a calorie is, and understand how you shouldn't consume all that you can in a day, take a look at their nutrition information, where you will see that you can eat out, eat good food, and have a great (relaxed) time within a reasonable calorie count.  At this location, there is a courtyard right beside the restaurant with several table for outside dining.  On Friday night, they have entertainment - music that is always enjoyable, doesn't tend to have you covering your ears, and over which you can easily carry on your conversation.  In a word, pleasant!!  So, why not five stars?  I think that it must be price.  For swift food, it seems to be edging JUST a little bit toward the \"high\" side.  But never to fear, Boneheads always has some coupon offer going, either in one of the daily deal offer thingies, or in the mailers, or in a book.  Just look around, find your coupon and go try it!  You might find that it's worth going back even without the coupon (like we do!).  Oh, and yes, you can get beer and wine here as well!  See you there!"}
{"text":"I see this more of a lunch joint. The food comes out fast and it's not going to weigh you down when you are back at your desk. Plus the value is excellent, not to mention that I found a coupon at 360Charlotte.com. As the name implies, it's either fish or chicken. I had the tilapia with pineapple salsa, plus rice and grilled zucchini, which turned out to be a fairly healthy meal (not sure how much butter is in the seasoned rice). It came out looking and tasting like a home cook meal and was quite delicious. It's true that the menu is somewhat limited so take their name seriously, don't go unless you are in the mood for grilled fish or piri piri chicken."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Boneheads and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was really good. Everything was fresh and tasty. The prices are very affordable and you definitely get a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Fabulous & flavorful.  Had salmon w pineapple salsa and grilled zucchini. Husband had mahi mahi w tangy Asian coleslaw and also had pineapple salsa. His piece of fish was smaller than mine and he did wish for a larger fillet, but nonetheless we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight. Mahi Mahi and chicken breast each entree comes with rice and a side. Very generous portions of very good, quality food. You won't leave hungry. We each had the Greek salad as our side; a size able portion with very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Ah, I hate to write this... But they switched their calamari. What use to be awesome, perfectly seasoned calamari appetizer is now bland over breaded rings. I even returned my order. Boneheads, please switch it back! Love, a calamari regular."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere being laid back.  I will have to try it again because I did not care for my chicken.  I was expecting a rub, and it was a sauce.  But, I tried my sisters shrimp and they were good, I will have to ask for light seasoning, they were heavily seasoned."}
{"text":"This is a partial-service deal: you order and pay at the register, and the staff bring the food to your table.  Nothing fancy as far as the interior goes, and the selection is fairly small.  However (and this is a big \"however\"), the food is great and very reasonably priced.  I highly recommend the grilled salmon and the marinated cold broccoli."}
{"text":"This is one of my local staples!  Fresh quality seafood and chicken dishes in a casual atmoshere.  Grilled Tilapia seasoned with Boneheads spice and flame broiled topped with black bean and corn salsa served with rice and grilled zucchini can't be beat, but everything on the menu is delish.  Crispy fried shrimp tossed with Boneheads sauce and served over cilantro slaw and the flash fried calamari rings with sweet Thai chili sauce, served over cilantro slaw are great starters.  On a nice night, enjoy dining outside by the fountain with the white rope lighting above.  :)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice in the last few weeks. We've tried the Mahi, peel and eat shrimp, and the taco combo plate. Everything has been wonderful! It's so nice to have a counter service meal that you feel healthful eating. The patio is great, with strings of lights and a small fountain.  My only complaint is the wait time. I would not be able to go here if I were in any sort of a hurry. We haven't had a much of a problem with it since we've come on weekend nights when we didn't have anything we needed to get to. In fact, it's nice to relax on the patio with a drink and have your meal paced if you choose to have an appetizer or salad before your entree. But if you're short on time or want a quick meal, this isn't really an option."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I was waiting for them to open up so that I could try the food. It's not a sit-down restaurant where you get served, but it's kind of like Nothing But Noodles, where you walk in and stand in line, look at the menu, tell the cashier what you want, and wait for the food to be ready. You can do take-out or sit in and eat. Nothing bad about the food, good taste, good portions, many options.  I'd come here again any day for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Boneheads is a good, reasonably priced restaurant. I get the Mahi-mahi. It comes with yellow rice and a choice of side. I get the sweet potato fries and a skewer of shrimp (which costs extra). They typically have live music on Friday nights. I sit outside by the fountain."}
{"text":"I really, really liked Boneheads in CA, so when I happened to be in Stonecrest, I was excited to try them again.  I was pretty disappointed.  The service was pretty good.  The food was not so great.  I ordered a meal that had 2 tacos (chicken, shrimp, or fish), and a side.  I decided to order one shrimp, one fish, and the grilled zucchini as my side.  The zucchini was, by far, the best thing on the plate.  The fish was mushy.  Cooked through, but with an almost waterlogged texture.  The taco also included a shredded cabbage mixture, and a spicy sauce.  The sauce was pretty good, actually.  The shrimp taco was inedible.  The shrimp was SO overcooked that they were beyond tough, and almost grainy.  They weren't hot, either.  It seemed that they must have been precooked and just sitting for some time.  It wasn't until after I ate that I noticed that their sanitation score was only 94.  shudder... Yeah, I'm disappointed to have to do it, but I'm crossing this one off of my list, and I guess saying goodbye to Boneheads for good.  :("}
{"text":"Food is ok, kids won't touch even the chicken nuggets here and when I tried one i know why... Blah. I had the taco plate and it was ok but something didn't sit well with me and I was sick when I got home.   Good concept but not going back."}
{"text":"The salmon here is great. For an order-at-the-counter place, this rivals some of the best fish I've had in five star restaurants."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.  Food is fresh and cooked to order.  I always get the fish tacos and if you order a side salad - it's as large as the full serving.  The staff is nice and the food is always good.  The grilled zucchini is very good as a side item."}
{"text":"Are they closed for good?  I was a fan and disappointed to find a dark locked restaurant tonight. Hope it's not goodbye forever."}
{"text":"I've been pescetarian for about a year and a half now so discovering this place was amazing! The seafood is fantastic, the prices are manageable, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I normally get the shrimp tacos and the grilled zucchini, which both have delicious seasoning and great texture. The portions for the salad are huge, so I was surprised when I ordered one for the first time. Definitely a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Not gross but nothing struck me as amazing here. Everything seemed like easy meals I could make at home (cuz it could be bought frozen and cooked quick), even their signature sauce. I mean, you can see that they cook the food on a grill right by that open window to the kitchen. That still doesn't mean that they use fresh/not frozen meat and stuff. Chicken was pretty overly-sauced. Rice was pretty salty. Salad was blah. The clam chowder was alright, but I only liked it more than everything else--cuz I don't know how to make it myself at home. I still dream about the clam chowder I've had in Seattle and San Fran, so even mediocre clam chowder does the trick in a pinch.   We got a coupon to eat here, and I'm glad we didn't pay full price. Definitely will not return, mostly because I can't think of anything here that I would ever crave. Maybe if it was the millennium and there was no other food..."}
{"text":"Clam chowder soup is awesome!! Wings are good but small. I've had their tacos before and they are good but I'm really not a fan of their Asian slaw."}
{"text":"Suprisingly impressed with this quick little 5 store chain restaurant. Since this Boneheads is (currently) the only one in Charlotte, I wanted to check it out one sunny afternoon strolling around Ballantyne...  The ambiance is super clean, efficient and plenty of seating. You'll see tons of bright colors, tables (both high and low) and a couple of big booths. The menu is chock full of fishes. Fishes of all sorts, cooked in a variety of ways. Hubs wanted to start with the crispy shrimp app (tossed in a spicy aioli with a hint of Piri Piri) and while it's definitely not a health-conscious choice, it was damn tasty. Lightly fried shrimp with a spicy glaze...party in my mouth time.   For my lunch I went with the grilled mahi. All fish is chargrilled and lightly seasoned with Boneheads' special spices and come with seasoned rice, choice of a topping and a side. I chose the pineapple salsa topping and grilled zucchini strips. The fish was perfectly grilled and the pineapple salsa was very fresh and a perfect accompaniment. The rice was meh and while the zucchini strips were nice, grilled and crunchy, they were more akin to zucchini logs than strips. It was a bit tough to cut through them!  Overall, Boneheads serves up fast and fresh grilled fish that will please many. Be aware that it's not the cheapest option on the block - but for a nice piece of grilled fish and plenty of sides, it's a healthy, tasty choice."}
{"text":"Been a fan for a longtime, unfortunately quality of food has gone down tremendously. Chicken was rubber and fries were old. Really liked it, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The thing I liked the most was the freshness of everything.  You have to be careful IF you don't like things overcooked tell them .. they dried out all 3 of our fish meals. The manager was great he saw us picking and came over and got us 3 new pieces ...they were perfect.  Highly recommend for some healthier than most reasonably priced Eats!"}
{"text":"It's a quick fix with pretty healthy options. Flavor was OK, but given the focus the put on the Piri sauces I was expecting more.  Decent change of pace place, not a lot of comparable alternatives."}
{"text":"I loved their chicken.  Very good!!!! Their sides could be a little bit bigger,  besides that i truly enjoyed eating thwir chicken!"}
{"text":"There was a serious staffing issue tonight. Waited 26 minutes (as per receipt time stamp) and they had not even started our order.  First time we got a full refund and left. With my son having to head back to college we could not wait. Also, they were messing up orders and very slow. Grill person was breaking up all the fish. Something was badly awry tonight."}
{"text":"We go here pretty often.  Mostly we sit outside on the weekends when they have a musician in the courtyard.  Inside gives off the fast-food vibe, outside more bistro feel.  My husband loves the taco combo, I typically get the piri-piri chicken.  We love the fresh veggies and the sauces.  Great place to meet friends!"}
{"text":"The snapper is scrumptious! The chilled broccoli salad is good. Actually, I love all of their vegetable sides. Every type of fish they offer is always perfectly grilled. My mom loves their piri piri chicken. The sauce is divine, and the portion of chicken is massive, for the price. Give it a try if you like a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Didn't expect it to be so good!!! I ordered half and app of shrimp and it came with rice and my choice of side. I chose grilled zucchini. The shrimp was similar to Bang bang shrimp. I got a nice portion of shrimp, rice and zucchini. This appetizer portion could've been my dinner. My bf ordered the peel and eat shrimp and it was a big portion, fresh and some of the best he's ever had!!! I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"$3 fish tacos were really nice & I would come back for them. The Asian slaw was delicious & has me craving more as I type.   The outdoor seating is lovely with overhead string bulb lights & a fountain which would make for a romantic setting in the evenings. I did notice the service was quite slow so make sure you're not in a rush.  It's a bit expensive for a meal but you're getting nice quality fish and goodies. They have a small beer & wine selection in addition to sodas."}
{"text":"Went here on 7/12/2012  Excellent!Had haddock plate was grilled with a bit of spicy, but not tounge burning. Great healthy budget friendly meal ."}
{"text":"Good food, wish there were more options!  I've had both the chicken and the tilapia here, and both are good.  However, they are really lacking in their choice of sides.  The only hot veg is grilled zucchini.  You can get cold salsa or cold broccoli, and they also have fries The bean/corn salsa is good mixed with the rice, and the grilled zucchini is also good - but if you're looking for more variety, you won't find it here."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Grilled fish was tasty and well-cooked, sweet potato fries (!) were good and I love the Piri-Piri sauce.  Cucumber lime yogurt \"topping\" was just OK; the sauce for The Missus' fish & chips was unexceptional as well.  That said, eveything was well-cooked and tasty.  Reasonable prices too, especially for quality seafood. Very nice, recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite quick what u eating except they are seriously slow...even if you call ahead to place an order. I've placed phone orders three times only to wait for 20 min when I get there because they had forgotten to start the order. If it wasn't for that, they would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here with a Living Social deal. The calamari was OK...liked the sweet and sour sauce that came with it. The zucchini side is pretty good and definitely fresh. The shrimp skewers were acceptable, but nothing special. This is a semi-fast food restaurant where you order at a counter, get your own drink, and then have your meal delivered. Staff was friendly, and service was very quick. You can see the kitchen through glass, so little kids seem to enjoy watching, and the cooks were friendly and engaging with them. If I could give a 3.5, I would, but not quite a 4 in my opinion. The menu doesn't initially seem kid friendly, but they do have a kids' menu with chicken fingers and fish nuggets, etc. Find a Living Social and check it out. Located in the hidden corner of Ballantyne's Stonecrest shopping center, across from Starbucks."}
{"text":"Fast Food and Fish usually do not belong in the same sentence or SHOULD not belong in the same sentence.  However, I found Boneheads to be surprisingly good against all odds and negative expectations.  They are set up like a \"just fresh\", panera or Quedoba at first glance but they bring your food to you once ordered.  They had a few different fish entrees to choose from that came with your choice of topping, rice and 1 side.  You can also change out the rice for another side for one more dollar.  I went with the grilled shrimp platter and sprung for the extra side to replace the rice.  I ordered the asian coleslaw which was marinated in a cilantro based vinegarette.  I also opted for the grilled zucchini.  I chose the pineapple salsa for my topping on the shrimp.    The shrimp came served on skewers and they were very flavorful but quite small.  I would have preferred a more plump bottom feeder but that was not the case.  The slaw was very good and the zucchini was...well it was zucchini.  Nothing great.    Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their mahi-mahi and salmon.  Everyone was full and pretty satisfied by the end of the meal.  The nice thing is this meal didn't break the bank, it was relatively quick and pretty guilt free.    They aren't winning any atmosphere awards but that is not their goal.  They did have a nice local artist playing his guitar and singing lovely tunes while we dined.  It was quite relaxing.    I'm not eager to return but I wouldn't mind coming back.  They are pretty decent."}

{"text":"The food is always good and fresh and the people are nice and welcoming. (And the coupons from Restaurant.com aren't bad either). There are several options for fresh, grilled seafood, the soup is great and the grilled zucchini can't be beat. And don't forget your coupons."}
{"text":"If your looking for the BEST SHRIMP tacos, this is the place to go. Awesome service and food"}
{"text":"Very good food, very inexpensive, and fantastic service. I/we were quite impressed and will be back to enjoy their tasty menu frequently. Good job boneheads, you've got another loyal guest in me."}
{"text":"Not only did they switch their Calamari to frozen as another reviewer said, but they also changed the Boneheads Shrimp!! No longer do you get plump perfectly battered shrimp. This was a major disappointment for me today!! No more appetizers for me!!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight.  It was fantastic.  I was a little intimidated since you order at the register and they bring the order to your table (you eat with real plates and silverware).  Luckily the menu is not that extensive and you can make on the fly decisions.  With what I had and what I saw on the grill while ordering it doesn't look like you could make a bad choice here.  I had the grilled Tilapia with pineapple salsa and grilled zucchini.   I like how affordable it is too."}
