{"text":"Wow I have to say that I am fully upset that we waited in line for 40 mins and then waited another 30 to get this food! They should be ashamed. If you are searching for food truck for a special event, look for something else."}
{"text":"I tried a Chicken Taco and a Cheese Quesadilla from Arizona Tacos yesterday at an expo in Mesa. Honestly, Mexican Food is not usually my first choice, but I was absolutely blown away by these two plates! The Chicken Taco was on a corn tortilla and had great seasoning, with an excellent green sauce. As far as the quesadilla, I'm not sure what mix of cheeses he uses, but it comes out buttery and delicious. The flour tortilla was good quality. Also, wait time for my food wasn't long at all.

He offers seasonings for sale, and if they are half as good as the other things I tried, then I will be buying those in bulk. Seriously though, they would be the perfect thing to send to my family back East. I am always looking for something specifically made in Arizona to send to them during the holidays or for their birthdays, and these little seasoning bottles are a good size for mailing! Hey; buy local, right?

Okay, actually I did buy one more thing - dessert! I got a churro, and it was fantastic. I mean perfect. Perfect cinnamon to sugar ratio. They haven't caved to this low-fat, low-calorie churro trend. It's nice to know I can still get a classic, real churro when I need one. They'll definitely be seeing me at the ordering window again at Arizona Tacos."}
{"text":"This truck is over priced and has a lot of learning to do.. the \"adobada\" looks like carne asada.. and the carne asada looks like ground beef. Id rather go to taco bell. #truth"}
{"text":"I had Arizona Tacos at one of my events. They were very friendly and easy to work with. I tried one of their beef and one of their pork tacos and thought they were delicious! Exactly what I expect for a street style taco. I heard lots of other people saying positive things about their food as well. I'm excited to have them at another event."}
