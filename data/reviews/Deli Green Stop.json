{"text":"Disapointing breakfast potatoes taste old could not eat pancakes. I could go on but it would be redundent. Only thing posivite was the price but then again if ate at home it would have been both cheaper and better. At lest we won't have to do dishes."}
{"text":"The breakfast is ok because their pancakes are not too good. Such big portions with very nice prices. But.. the servers are not all very friendly or attentive which kind of annoyed me."}
{"text":"Endroit nostalgique, qui sert des portions abondantes à prix modique. Tous les classiques y sont maîtrisés et servis dans un décor absolument fantastique. 

Vaut le détour"}
{"text":"Service lent  et peu cordiale le soir où je suis allé bien que le resto ait été aux trois quarts vide. 
Pizza à la croute dure et à l'aspect réchauffé.  
Pour le même prix on peut avoir mieux: restaurent Nouveau Verdun par exemple"}
{"text":"I watched the cook drop a hot dog on the floor and put it in the bun and seved it to the customer verry unsanitary place"}
{"text":"Wtf? I like that they serve breakfast all day. . I don't like that at 11pm they only offer take out or at the counter. And the part where I'm displeased is that I feel we were just ripped off... benedictin eggs are 10.50$ before taxes. We ordered 2. My friend had extra bacon and extra sauce.... because of those 2 extras our bill was in total 36$!!!!! How the hell are we been charged as if we ordered 3 plates???? Even the cook told the waitress we were overcharged and she treated him like an idiot.... there's a problem obviously but I'm really upset.... Also they are taking forever.... I wouldn't recomend this place..."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to for a a quick steamy and fries I've been coming since I was 2. 
It's gone down hill for sure the staff usually sit in the back at a booth looking upset as ever which is a terrible look for the resto. They did clean up the place with a new paint job and tvs which is a lot better.

50 cents for a package of mayo (miracle whip) no thank you lol

Last few times I've eaten from there my fries were uncooked hot dog soggy and burger.

The worst part they used to have a good poutine now they put barely any cheese and charge you $3 if you want extra which for $2 more you can get another poutine.

They are getting 2 stars only because I've been coming since I was a baby."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. We order delivery from here. I like not having a time limit to order breakfast, but its over priced for what it is and not fabu in terms of taste. Been trying to find a decent smoked meat for delivery near by, but ...is it just me? ... Or do the pickins seem slim? The smoked meat here is wayyyyy overpriced (10.77 plus tax for A SANDWICH that is at best the bare minimum portion for that price) and appears to either be sliced with a meat slicer or straight out of a package ...both of which i was not expecting from a 12$ sandwich, it was juicy enough however but i was still disappointed. They probably got a good laugh at my request for \"medium fat\" as i realized upon opening the sandwich. The poutine however i found pretty tasty actually ...great brown gravy (coulda been more generous with the gravy), cheese curds in every bite, homestyle french fries...a lil weird background taste goin on to the gravy but i found it nummy, good portion for the prices too (large is really large lol)...which i found weird compared to the sandwich. Its an option but there's not much reason to not seek elsewhere when you consider the prices."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a greasy diner, this is the place.  We had a nice big plate of smoked meat and a big plate of poutine.  Both were delicious, but I was actually expecting slightly better poutine.  It's not the fanciest of places (i.e. you need to get a key to use the bathroom), but hey, it's a cheap choice and open late!"}
{"text":"Leaving this blank for now so I can come back and comment when I'm slightly less likely to swear."}
{"text":"My go-to for poutine. The large poutine is HUGE and easily shared! The dark sauce is by far the tastiest I've had. We actually bought a tub and used it on the family X-mas turkey... More than once."}
{"text":"Sure, this place isn't as cheap as you want it to be. Maybe the food isn't the most amazing. But it's a diner. It really wins at being a diner.

The coffee is bottomless. Like they're not kidding. Even after I'd loitered over a book and my food had long been cleared away, they still kept refilling my cup until I had to beg them to stop. Because I have no self control with coffee and will just keep drinking it until my heart explodes. Luckily, diner coffee is weak enough that it'd really take a lot.

I got a crepe omelette, which was strangely delightful. I ate until I was stuffed and my plate was still 2/3 full. So bring an appetite (and then some).

The decor is what really makes it. The weird cat/butterfly/bird stained glass is something special."}
{"text":"Très bon Resto style deli j'adore ca la nourritures toujours bonne un très bon service bon choix au menu un peux de tout assiette smoke meat assez généreuse comme portion à essayer :)"}
