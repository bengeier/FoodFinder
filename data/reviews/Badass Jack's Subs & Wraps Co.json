{"text":"Been good every time. Matches up to other establishments in the chain. Super friendly."}
{"text":"Badass Jacks makes the best wraps in town, I highly recommend the Chicken caesar wrap with terriyaki sauce!  The best!"}
{"text":"I love getting Roast Beef subs for Dinner here.  I have been a customer for years.  The subs are a bit more money than subway, but they are filling and taste better and way better for you.  They have lots to choose from.  Their pasta salad is really good but they don't always have it.  Not sure if they just don't make it all the time or if other people are hogging it.  Leave some for me eh?  They give stamps for the return customers to get rewards.  The place looks clean and nice.  The staff are always friendly and happy."}
{"text":"Try one of the wraps, they are delicious! I keep telling myself that I'm going to order something new, but every time I go to Badass Jacks I get a large chicken terry wrap and it is ALWAYS amazing!"}
{"text":"I remember enjoying Badass Jacks when I first had them several years ago. It seems that, since then, they have made exactly zero changes. Because of this, I found a recent visit to the Badass Jacks in Southwood in SW Calgary a very mediocre experience. This fast food restaurant features a small menu of pre-set wraps and subs as well as a build your own option and some \"asian\" style boxes. 

I had a chicken club cheezy grilled wrap. This was a pressed wrap filled with chicken, bacon, cheese, honey mustard sauce and veggies. At $7.50 for a small size, I found the portion lacking. If you are in the area and need a quick sandwich, this is an acceptable option, but I woulnd't go out of my way to re-visit."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I wasn't impressed. I haven't been in this store in a few years and man it looks dated!! I like the concept of bad ass jacks....wraps, subs, stir fry box type thing. I have enjoyed the food (usually getting wraps). Today I went for a rice box with chicken and pineapple curry sauce. The food tasted pretty good but the veggies they give were minimal, like seriously a large tablespoon. And it looked like frozen reheated vegetables. The chicken...minimal and the sauce and rice TOO MUCH. of course lots of rice, it's cheap. It had good flavor but too much sauce and not enough veggies. It was like a rice, saucy soup. Based on today's experience, I prob won't be back in a while. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"I know \"BAJ\" is well-loved by many of my friends, but personally I find their menu very confusing. I ate here 4ish years ago and felt the same way when I tried it earlier this week. Between all the choices of sauces, veggies, meats, rice vs. Noodles, and even the flavor of wrap you want, I always find myself taking forever to decide. I find that there are too many options and they are kind of random and undecided between Asian flavors and Mexican flavors. I like the fresh veggies and the staff are extremely friendly, but it's personally not my favourite place to go. Because they fry up the contents of the wrap, it can get quite messy and drippy, and I found myself wondering why I had Asian tastes inside a typically Mexican wrap. I prefer when restaurants can stick to one theme, but that may just be my own particular quirkiness!"}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy, simply good food. Can't go wrong with a box of noodles, veggies & meat, or a wrap it sub.  Decent prices. Only major downside: parking sucks."}
{"text":"This place is my \"go to\" when I don't want to venture far from home. Their wraps kick ass and I love their ethnic boxes."}
{"text":"Badass Jack's is located in Elbow Dr SW in a little strip mall area across from Tim Hortons.  It's a true hidden gem.

The first time I tried badass was when Spence thought about it  because he went there a ton while he was going to school way back when and we decided to check it out.  It's not a huge place but it is quite cute.  There is about 15 seats or so inside.  When you first walk in, theres a huge glass display where they make your selected food.  And theres a lot of options.  Sandwiches, wraps, grilled wraps, asian style boxes, pasta salads....

I always get the bad ass philly cheese wrap.  IT IS THE BEST!  There is a small ($6.99) or regular (I always get regular - $8.49) and the wrap is smeared with cream cheese, sprinkled with marble shredded cheese, topped with roast beef, lettuce, onions, green peppers, mushrooms and BBQ ranch.  The BBQ ranch is amazing, it makes the wrap very tasteful and mouthwatering. They then grill the wrap flat, nice and hot!  Spence usually gets the Teriyaki chicken sub (price varies, depending which you get).  They heat up the chicken with teriyaki sauce in a pan and top the sub with whatever you like.  Spence gets lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots and cheese.  Its pretty tasty too!

All in all, this place is a hot spot to stop to get your subs and wraps! You'll have to see the selection for yourself.  The staff is very friendly, I believe they are brothers that work there...twin brothers! So cute.  We've become regulars there so they know what I like :)

Ps. There is also another location in Crowfoot Cres in the NW!
GO THERE ASAP!"}
{"text":"THE BEST. Chicken teriyaki with noodles for the win! One of our favourites for sure!! We have been going here for more than a decade and it's been the same customer service and same taste the entire time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
