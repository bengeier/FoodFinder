{"text":"will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try to stay closer to home and saw the reviews for this place, not so bad. Was greeted by a super friendly guy who quickly changed from friendly to downright annoying. He took our drink orders as soon as he seated us, was back in a flash and asked if we needed more time. Yes, we did. Two minutes later, asked if we were ready. Nope, sorry. Again. And again. I don't know what his hurry was but he was determined to get our order within 5 minutes of us walking in the door. Whatever. 

I ordered the house chicken. When it arrived I was surprised, they give you a lot of food! I thought I had hit the jackpot! It was crispy, not overly sweet or spicey. Very good. We had a lot of leftovers, everything turned out great.

Until about 5 hours later. I was pretty gassy after that but whatevs, I don't mind farting and I'm pretty gassy anyways. Then it became painful. I knew it was coming and it was going to be hot. I got the shits. Explosive. Seven times. 

It's hard to tell what exactly has turned your ass into a chocolate fountain by the end of the day...but I won't risk it again."}
{"text":"This place is so good and the portion sizes are great! I love the orange chicken and crab puffs."}
{"text":"Our family of 9 came in for dinner.  We ordered the Family meal for 8.  We ate and ate and ate and yet, we had SO much food leftover!  The food was tasty but the service was FANTASTIC!!  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We always have seen this restaurant but never stopped. Today we did it and what a surprise, the food was very good and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This is the wife and I favorite Chinese food in Glendale. Absolutely love the food and the service is awesome. Come and enjoy some really good food !!!"}
{"text":"I love the food, However, there is a male employee  who is usually at the cash register, or he will answer the phone when you place a pick-up order,  I think he's rude. If it wasn't for the good food, I would not frequent this establish due to his bad attitude."}
{"text":"I only come here for the General Tso's beef its the best in my opinion. I have tried the sesame seed chicken, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp chow mein and they were all pretty good. Its never really all that busy and you typically dont have to wait too long for your food."}
{"text":"LARGE PORTIONS OF SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR QUALITY WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD!
A whole lot of bad!I ordered the sweet and sour combination and i couldn't tell what was what . Almost all batter with weird shaped cuts of unidentifiable meats .To top of it off (no side of sweet and sour sauce. This place stinks like old fry oil and prices are high. My friend ordered the beef and broccoli . Fatty skirt steak with frozen looking broccoli .Crab puffs had no flavor and fried rice was sticky. Bad Chinese food !"}
{"text":"It was okay. The crab puffs were good, but the rest of the food was very bland. I've had worse but I've definitely had better and it wasn't worth the price. On the plus side, it was fast and the people were nice."}
{"text":"Good food and huge portions. I've never met anyone who has left hungry after eating here!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been coming here a long time. The food is great and the staff is very attentive. The Gen. Tso chicken is amazing!"}
{"text":"Once again, Grand Dragon did not disappoint. We love this place, the chicken is consistently breaded and cooked well, staff superbly friendly and professional, overall Grand Dragon is by far, one of the smartest decisions you could make when it comes to meal time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Typical American Chinese restaurant. Their food is always tasty, reasonably priced and not greasy. I know if seems like a strange thing to mention but I always get sick after eating at Chinese restaurants and this is 1 of 2 places I have never gotten sick at. I love their crab puffs-they're slightly sweet (yum!) and I have tried various chicken dishes and all of them have been great! Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean and I can call in my order drive over and it's ready by the time I get there. I'm a happy customer every time I go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the affordable lunch special, the portion is amazing and it comes with a delicious egg roll, cream puff and this sweet sauce.

I got the orange chicken with fried rice lunch platter and it was very good. It had a chili pepper sign next to it, meaning it must be spicy but it wasn't spicy at all, which is a plus for me, not sure about others."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, greasy Asian food. It doesn't get better than this amazing Glendale institution that's been around forever.  Decor is crazy tacky but who cares when the food is so good. 

I'm obsessed with the noodles and my husband chooses the beef and broccoli everytime.  Even my toddlers eat it all. 

All in all delicious dinner.  Oh and remember they're closed Mondays!"}
{"text":"It's been in our neighborhood for years been going there for years love their food excellent customer service"}
{"text":"Once I discovered this place I have always come back. Staff is really nice and there food doesn't disappoint. I always order to-go and the food is always ready. My favorite thing to get is the soups. They all have a good flavor and the lunch specials are awesome deals; get a lot if food for cheap. Overall, they have a cosy & peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Of the Chinese places we've tried so far, this is probably the best of the bunch.  Not to say that it was fantastic, but it was better tasting than anything else I've had in the valley.  I'm starting to resign myself to the fact that I am probably not going to find great Chinese food here."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service at a fair price. There's no shortage of Chinese restaurants in the area, but my family and I keep ending up here. 

Kids love the crispy noodles and duck sauce; orange chicken; and Egg flower soup."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the last 13 years. It is the best family owned Chinese food I've found, hands down. A plus, the portions are substantial so you get a lot of food for the money. On occasion I get pulled one way or another into another place that serves Chinese won't mention any names, but not Grand Dragon. I always end up frustrated I spent money on sub par Chinese. Grand Dragons food has been consistently delicious for 15 years. You can't beat their lunch prices. I take out mostly, they've NEVER messed up an order! When I do dine in their attentiveness is fantastic and there are several treats like wontons and soup served with every order. I hope to call this my Chinese food place for another 15 years! Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Noodles and rice were good! I ordered the orange chicken but was my cup of tea. The bread on the chicken fell apart and was very soggy. I will try something different if I try this place again."}
{"text":"Great food great employees! A true chinese experience! I will definitely be back whenever I am craving chinese!"}
{"text":"Went to Grand Dragon for the first time today for lunch, it was super delicious! I got the Daily Lunch Special and I really like the fact that every day is different! I went with two of my daughter's and we will be going back!!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews and moving into the neighborhood almost a year ago, I finally decided to give this place a try. We went for lunch on a Saturday. The place is very clean, quiet and has very cool AC (Summer in AZ!) and a very attentive waitress. I reviewed the menu, the prices for lunch specials under $7 bucks! We had the Popo Platter, it was amazing! My husband had Kung Pao Shrimp, I had Shrimp and vegetables. Portion size for the lunch and price was awesome! The quality and flavor of the dishes we chose was very, very good! I really enjoyed my lunch and cant wait to go back and try other items. Best part, it is right down the street!
Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions. The food is wonderful. This is our new Chinese restaurant that we will be ordering from from now on. This was our second time and it was even better than the first. We had our family order from there too and they loved it as well."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. We visit Grand Dragon several times a month. This is the best Chinese food in Phoenix, the portions are great! I always have enough leftover for another meal, and the prices are reasonable. The service is eager to please, and they always seem genuinely pleased to see us. They don't mind making a few modifications for our picky tastes, either. Major score, Grand Dragon. I absolutely am in love with their lo mein noodles, which had a slight smoky flavor. 

The large eggrolls remind me of those at the old mom and pop Chinese restaurants down south. It's very difficult to find a good eggroll in the valley, but Grand Dragon gets really close to perfect. The egg drop soup... meh... I've had better. General Tso's chicken is my #1 pick! 

My only complaint, if you can call it that, is they won't deliver to my area. I'm about 2 blocks off of their grid, however, I will say this... After I called begging and pleading for them to please deliver because I couldn't make it with a broken leg, they made a one-time exception and delivered to my house anyway. That's world-class customer service."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very accommodating of my shrimp allergy.  The crab puff were the best thing that we ordered. The rest was good but nothing out of this world amazing. Really they are the best option I have found for this area and will be coming back. Sizzling rice soup make any sick day so much better."}
{"text":"This is a clean neighborhood Chinese American restaurant. You'll find your old favorites here, but don't look for authentic Szechuan or Hong Kong dishes. That's not what it's about.

The staff is friendly and attentive, the decor is used-to-be-a-coffee-shop, but well maintained. The prices are very reasonable.

Families are welcome, and I hope people bring their children for the kind of Chinese food I remember from when I was a kid.

I had moo goo gai pan, which came with two or three sweet crab puffs, an egg roll, a cup of plain fried rice, and chow mein noodles. With a pot of hot tea, it came to $10.51 with tax. Hard to beat that for value when it tastes so good."}
{"text":"For the price and quality, this is a great place. I get lunch here at least once or twice a week. Never disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. They serve you plenty and the service was good. I will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Delilah and authentic. I support local business.  Hidden and great food and service.  Reminds me of a place in la jolla California years ago....closed now.  So, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Chinese food. I followed a few tips from previous yelp reviewers, but they must know what good Chinese food is. The fried rice was just rice with soy sauce, no veggies or egg or anything. The low mein was just that... Noodles. Bland. Boring. Sticky noodles. And the sesame beef was mainly fat and grissle and covered in a super sweet honey sauce. The only saving grace was the crab puffs, they were pretty tasty and different than what I've had before."}
{"text":"Ive lived in the area over 18 years and have never been to Grand Dragon, ive seriously been missing out!! it was cold and raining and we all decided some good Chinese was in order. I checked this place out and decided to give it a go, definitely wasnt disappointed! I ordered to go: twice cooked chicken (which i believe they call it double cooked chicken), sesame chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. (Can you tell we all like chicken?) I love the sauce of twice cooked chicken, so i wanted to try their version. Great flavour! wow! i really really liked that they didnt add the sauce to the chicken (for the to go order). I had leftovers and enjoyed that i could wok up the chicken again and then add the sauce and it not be ruined. great flavour on both the sesame and sweet and sour chicken. good amount of sauce on the sesame, the S&S could have more, we all thought. the sesame and S&S were both lunch combos, I wouldve liked if the twice cooked was too, but its fine. The lunch combo comes with dirty rice, egg roll, and crab puffs. This isnt your Panda Express or the typical asian fusion modern joint, this is good authentic cuisine. Just what i wanted. We definitely were all impressed and will be ordering/dining here again, cant believe it took me 18 years! cant wait to try more delicious dishes"}
{"text":"Food was average but the waiter was a hoot. We had a good time, will eat there again only if we are in the area though."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I got the Orange Chicken Combo to split.  With an extra order of crab puffs the Combo was more then enough for the 2 of us it came with the Orange Chicken, 1 egg roll, 1, crab puff,  rice and low main. It was all very good we will be back.  The staff were very nice and caring took pride in what they serve."}
{"text":"Their Sesame Chicken is amazing. Whenever we visit my father-in-law, we try to go here. 

Their combination plates are generous and delicious. 

Definitely a recommended place!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great customer service. Very speedy. We will be back! Best chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for years and have never been dissapointed. Nothing fancy or wierd just very good chinese food. If you have a craving, and want your basics sesame chicken, sweet & sour chicken, beef & broccoli,egg rolls,chicken & veggies,orange chicken or lemon chicken you will find that here. One of my favorites is sizzling rice chicken, verrry good! They definatley have more than what I am mentioning, but these just happen to be my faves. We bring our kids here all the time and they are very helpful when serving us. For example, they know my 4 yr old loves the egg drop soup with the crispy won tons , but because its so hot they always bring a small bowl of ice on the side to help cool it down. They also know that my 4 yr old knows how to say thank you in chinese and I love how they encourage her to speak more. This will always be a neighborhood favorite , good food, good service and good people!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fast service, and big portions. The General Tso's is by far the best I've had. Sadly, closed on Mondays though."}
{"text":"This place has great food and the service is amazing! I never have to ask for a thing .. Its like they are reading my mind.  Everything is good from the sweet and sour chicken to the appetizers."}
{"text":"We ate here Christmas Day, doing the \"Chinese food on Christmas\" thing.  This place does classic American-style Chinese food, and they do it well.  You are not going to be wowed by an interesting or authentic experience here, so don't come expecting that.  This is exotic only to the the palate of a child.  However, this is exactly what you expect of American-style Chinese food....lovely tempura batter on the chicken, flavorful brown sauce, tasty egg fried rice, fun pu pu platter.  I remember as a child doing \"family style\" Chinese food with my family....the soup course, egg rolls, crab angels, fried rice, a few simple entrees, and fortune cookies....this is exactly what I wanted out of the experience, and this is exactly what I got.  This place has the Chinese zodiac menus under the table glass.  The restaurant itself is mid-century classic Chinese restaurant, which is right up my alley.  The prices are very affordable, and the portions are huge.  If you are looking for \"cuisine,\" really fantastic food, move on.  If you are looking for a quality mid-century style americanized Chinese food experience, this is the ticket, lol."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for take-out Chinese on the West side.  The chow mein has tasty noodles but they are a little stingy with the shrimp.  I appreciate that they leave the sauce of the orange chicken on the side so it doesn't get all soggy on the way home.  The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was served with big portions and wasn't terrible. Tried ordering some different sides and the server didn't seem very knowledgeable and came across like he was yelling."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for \"OUR\" Chinese restaurant since we moved back here from Washington state 6 years ago. We'd driven by many times (only 5 minutes from the house) but only tried it yesterday. I had the Mongolian Beef lunch combo and he had Teriyaki chicken. Good size portions and the food was really good. The egg roll was New York style and a good size. The crab puff was stuffed with cream cheese. OK, the rice was meh, but the entrees were enuf for leftovers tonight. We've found our place."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of about 5/6 times now. What gots me coming back is the way they make their SWEET N SOUR CHICKEN! I haven't found a Chinese spot where they actually cook the chicken with the sauce instead of just having it completely all on the side. I've always hated it prepared that way. It actually made me stop ever ordering sweet n sour chicken for YEARS until now. I do wish they put a little more of the vegetables in it. Every time I've ordered it its literally like 1 onion 1 bell pepper 1 carrot and 1 pineapple.

I haven't tried anything else really but the sweet n sour chicken from here. I've had a taste of the teriyaki chicken and I'm not a fan. I like the more sweeter sauce (like Big Hengs) with teriyaki and here it's more soy sauce based, so a salty flavor. Not my cup of tea for teriyaki chicken. But if you enjoy that salty version than go ahead and try it.

One little complaint though from my personal experience is.. It bugs me a little that the first 4times I've ordered take out and the one time I dined in they allowed for me to order the lunch plate with sweet n sour chicken.. Now these last 2 times they didn't let me and made me get the full combo. It's only a $1 more but still. 

Also, today when I ordered, they messed my order up a bit when I specifically said like 3times I wanted white rice instead of fried (because it automatically comes with fried with the combo) and got home and ended up with fried. Fail. Overall, like i mentioned above its the sweet n sour chicken that brings me back to get that craving fix!"}
{"text":"I found myself here for lunch after finding out the place I started to go in the neighborhood was closed.

When you pick your table you are handed a well worn multi-page menu and a print out of the dinner specials.  The print out seemed sort of odd for lunch so I dug into the menu and found a full page of lunch specials.  I chose the orange chicken.  I ordered it medium spice and it was not very spicy but it was really sweet and not crunchy like I am used too.  I liked the soup, egg roll and crab puff it came with.  I also liked the price, with a glass of iced tea and tax it was under $8 and I was stuffed.

I thought the table clothes were a nice touch.  Not all of the staff (family?) spoke English well. The service was very good.  While I was there I had the dining room to myself.  One person came in and ordered take out and they accepted a couple of phone orders as well.

Overall it is a decent neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  I would go back again but choose a different entree."}
{"text":"Laughably, appallingly bad for the price point. You can do much better for $8 than bland noodles, boring fried rice, and awful egg rolls that left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm shocked it took 30 minutes to prepare the sweet and sour pork I carried out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say grand dragon is the only and I mean only Chinese food that I have eaten here in Phoenix, Arizona the two years that I have been here. I'm a big Chinese food lover and I always have been so when I first moved here in 2015 I was extremely skeptical of trying new restaurants but I found this little gem on yelp not even 10 miles away from my home. I love their beef fried rice, beef chow mein, beef & broccoli (yes I love beef clearly), & sweet and sour pork. I love the fact that they put the lemon sauce if I get lemon chicken or the sweet & sour sauce on the side in the container so I can dip or poor as I please. Haven't had a bad meal yet. !!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! My family and I love this place. We might even call this our home away from home haha. My boyfriend and I first discovered this quaint little restaurant a year and a half ago and we have been coming back ever since, sometimes 2 or 3 times a month. The parking is adequate, the food is amazing, and the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. I absolutely love the moo goo gai pan and egg drop soup. My boyfriend can't get enough of the kung pow cabbage. My children ( ages 3, 5, 6) always eat the sweet and sour chicken and they actually like the egg rolls, which is a huge win. The prices are almost unbelievable for the amount of food you get. The portions are huge, you will always have leftovers. Also, they have the most genuinely friendly staff who are willing to make any accomodations to please you. Everything about this place is perfect. What I like most is that I can always count on having a pleasant time filled with great food and service when I eat here. There are some restaurants I enjoy eating at but I never know what kind of service I'm going to get or how well my food will be prepared because the staff is always different. The Grand Dragon has consistently provided the best service to my family and I for over a year and I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food. Veggies and meats are very good quality. Service was also awesome! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ;)
Me and my husband eat her almost every other 
Day ... You just have to try"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a rock-bottom price.  And the plates are HUGE!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been hare too many times and have ordered numerous amounts of entrees. I am a fan of the crab puffs here and even though I order different items every time. Crab puff are my go to! the costumer service here is exceptional, when dining in, when you order to go is not the best , they forget the little extras you ask for(spicy chilly, forks, spoons, napkins). But the food is good and i will be coming back."}
{"text":"Jane bit tastes the food yet, but this place has an unpleasant order as you walk in.  Not sure if it's in the rug or just a staggered smell across the whole place. 
I've heard some great reviews about this place from folks either waiting to be seated or standing in line waiting to pick up orders. 

To many folks thanking them for being open after being closed for more than two weeks.  Owners were in China. 

Everyone that walked in just kept complimenting their delicious dishes. 

I'm sure I will find out once I taste their food.  I stopped in after searching for a Chinese restaurant with at least 4-5 stars.  This place has 4 stars by their name so I decided to take my chances and stop in for some take out.
I bought $65+ of food to take home for myself and adults kids and their children/significant others that are dropping in for dinner. 

My chosen will be the final judges and I will soon post once again as to how our experience with their food was. 

Good thing my kids weren't with me, otherwise they would have complained  of the foul smell that lingers through ought this place. 

Hope they prove is wrong. If so, we'll be back again."}
{"text":"This be my regular take out place. I call in my order and the sweet people on the other end usually always get it right. 

They cook my meal to order. I like the orange chicken but I like it spicy. Super spicy. And thats how I get it. They also will sub all Lo Mein for the fried rice that comes in the combo. Which is great because I won't eat it all and I can split the noodles with the kiddo. You can also sub your fried rice for brown rice. They send an egg roll and fried wontons with every combo. They don't suck. 

I wouldn't recommend ordering one combo to have in one sitting unless you're a glutton or a glutton for punishment. It's a ton of food. I usually split my combo with the little dude. And still have some left over for lunch the next day.  Buddha usually orders the potstickers. He digs em. Not his favorite but he doesn't leave any over hahaha! 

I recommend it if you are needing that takeout fix in the Glendale area. Super cheap too. Lots of food for little dollars. Yeah, I'll take that."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Not great, but very, very good.  Plenty of good food at reasonable prices.  It's not quite a Mom and Pop type place, but pretty close. It's just your basic, local neighborhood Chinese joint.  Good prices and clean enough."}
{"text":"Grand Dragon is awesome! I could seriously go on and on about this place. The food is always fresh and taste me to order. Their combination plates for lunch and dinner are very affordable and give you a nice taste of everything without breaking the bank. The people who work there are always very polite and the timing on their orders is crazy accurate. When they say. That it will be ready in 15 minutes they are on point. No soggy or cold food here! One of my favorite things is the fact that they always get the top rating when it comes to food inspections. This is not only indicated by all of the certificates that they display from the health department but the cleanliness of their kitchen can definitely be also assumed by how clean the front of the house looks at this restaurant. We eat here often and recommend that you definitely try them out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. The staff is great. The food was ok. Priced well. It's not my first or second choice but I will be back for those \"I'm not cooking nights\"
since I live right down the street."}
{"text":"This place was super good! We were looking for a good Chinese place near our house. The last good place we found was all the way in Mesa which was super far from Glendale. So happy to have found this place. We ordered the Kung pow cabbage, egg fried rice, and the vegetable chow mein. We also had the crispy noodles and crispy chips on the side. Everything was really delicious, our server was super nice, she even offered us vegetarian wontons because she noted from what we were ordering that we were vegetarian. LOL."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp looking for Chinese food as close as possible.  General Tsao chicken was excellent prepared spicy asked for extra spicy and it was on point. I recommend neighborhood Chinese place."}
{"text":"Great service - good food. Love the Wor WonTon soup. Good size place that can accommodate a larger party.  Interior needs updating but good restaurant for a quick dinner or takeout."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff. Placed a to go order for the first time, the food was fresh and hot and delicious. I found my new chinese restraunt"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here , amazing! Not only is the atmosphere very calming but the staff is beyond wonderful and extremely helpful!  Was so blown away by their service , I left a $50 tip on a $70 bill,  love love love this place! Food is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite take-out Chinese food. Always fresh, great flavors, and we love that with any of the fried chicken entrees they put the sauce on the side (for example; sweet & sour chicken). We've ordered here at least a dozen times! If you go on their website there are coupons too."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic and consistent Chinese food.  Staff are all very invested in the business and want to make you into a return customer.  Hong Kong style Chinese food.  You can't really go wrong but noodles are the big winner here.  I've only done pick-up and delivery but the restaurant is clean and usually pretty full."}
{"text":"After years of eating here they still have Great service and great food!!!!!  Love going back to the old hood to eat here. Glad some things stay the same. The crab puffs are awesome!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really love the beef and broccoli and rice. BBQ pork fried rice is very good as well. Customer service is good and friendly.  The lunch specials are great prices. I have eaten here only a hand full of times but I have been satisfied everytime."}
{"text":"Love the service.. Great service is an understatement. good portions crab puffs are crisp soft in the middle"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite Chinese places in Phoenix. I've been coming here for years! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for good Chinese food at reasonable prices. The staff is very nice as well!"}
{"text":"This is our new Chinese restaurant and it took 4 years to find it.   The girl who answered the phone was very pleasant and helpful and the delivery young man was very nice as well.   Our food was hot and excellent tasting!!  Cashew chicken and sweet & sour pork and egg roll and spring rolls.  The soup is saved for lunch tomorrow and looks wonderful !"}
{"text":"This places food gives new meaning to pig slop. Awful, smelly and bad. We threw it all away.  The dog did not even get any it was so bad."}
{"text":"Great place for good chinese food. Very authentic and well prepared foods. I always ask for more garlic and make it spicy hot! That's just me but they always accommodate me.
Broccoli beef is really good...I would like more vegetables though in their dishes.
The dish I always judge a chinese rest by is War Wonton Soup and theirs is bout the best I have had.
For the combo dinner menu they have the option of getting a small portion of sweet sour pork or chicken for only $2.50 more! Love that!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for an early dinner. I used to hang out quite a bit in this neighborhood, so I know this place has been here a while. Pretty much a solid, no-frills Chinese joint with good food, generous portions, and attentive service. Good choice if you want Chinese food and are near GCC."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried this place until tonight! Lived down the road from here for years, and never looked twice because they always had the shades down and the outside didn't look appealing. But went there and had general tso's (off their daily special -- includes rice, chow mein, crab ragoons, and an egg roll) while my parents had moo goo gai pan and orange chicken. Absolutely delicious! Food wasn't greasy, it was FRESH and HOT! Noodles were amazing, rice was cooked perfectly. Portions? Gigantic! I'm so glad I went."}
{"text":"Great place for typical Chinese cuisine. Reasonable price and good size portions. Difinately try the House Chicken."}
{"text":"I called and they said they do not deliver anymore due to the fact of not having a driver's"}
{"text":"I had this just yesterday. It was late at night and we were craving Chinese food but didn't want the typical Panda Express. So, I asked Siri to find me a Chinese place and because of the 4 stars we decided to give it a shot. The food was delicious! It was brought out in a timely manner and the staff was very nice! Overall we are definitely going back. :)"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but I'm not sure it's 4/5-star worthy.  We ordered two dishes - and boy did they give us a lot of food.  Unfortunately, when they say \"beef with vegetables\" what they mean is a pound of beef and two pieces of carrot.  I was hoping for a better ratio of meat and veggies.  Egg rolls were really really good, and they had real mustard - not that crap in the packet with the panda on it - real, burn your sinuses out mustard - praise the lord.  We ordered the crispy fried tofu - won't do that again.  The tofu was in HUGE chunks so it was like deep-fried custard cubes.  I've had fried tofu before, this didn't quite cut it.

Nothing really negative to say - the price was fine, the food was fine, and it's close.  

Biggest plus?  I have never, ever, ever been to a Chinese food restaurant where the people were as friendly. Super-nice staff - thanks for that!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2007 and the service and food is always amazing. Definitely a hidden gem in Glendale."}
{"text":"Every once and a while I need a little Grand Dragon in my life!

I stumbled upon this place when I was working on a house in Glendale and needed to fulfill my need for some Chinese food - and then I was hooked. For under $10 I can get general's chicken with brown rice, crab puffs, spring roll, and lo mein. Oh and you want to add a side of sweet and sour chicken to that order for $2.95 - perfect!
This food is delicious and affordable. Trust me you will get filled up and have some to take home for lunch the next day! The service is always great and the restaurant itself is comfortable!

And I'll have to cut this review short to stuff some more general's chicken in my face!

{"text":"I discovered this place through Yelp and was very pleased with the food. I ordered the lunch special which was: Fried Rice, Teriyaki Chicken, Egg Roll and a Crab Puff for $6 max. It was very delicious! The Fried Rice and Teriyaki Chicken was very soft and moist, the Egg Roll is how it should be; crispy on the outside and cooked just right in the inside. The Crab Puff was also delicious for that oomph of flavor. When we ordered over the phone for pick-up (please note: they DO NOT DELIVER due to not enough drivers. Perhaps they will in the near future), the guy that took the order was very helpful and patient while we went over their menu items. I would give it 5 stars but when picking up our order, I sorta expected to be more welcomed even though we're picking up our order and not dining in. Of course I'm sure that if we were dining in, we would have experienced a lot more reaction. But other than that; the food was delicious, the help over the phone was awesome and I do plan on re-ordering again when I'm back in the valley! I bookmarked this one under my favorites! Keep up the delicious food Grand Dragon!"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch. I ordered the Beef & Scallops Combination, off the Chef's Specialties section and a side order of chicken fried rice. The Beef & Scallops, was prepared in a brown sauce, with snow peas, water chestnuts, black mushrooms, broccoli & baby corn. The dish was colorful, tasty, but nothing to suggest. When I commented to the waiter, \"I thought there would be more scallops in the dish, he said, it's to expensive to have more.\" So, if you can, save your money & try something else on the menu. Besides that, the chicken fried rice was decent. So far, the roast pork fried rice was the best in flavor & taste. In conclusion, if you don't mind paying a higher tax for food in the city of Glendale, Grand Dragon is the restaurant to go for a well prepared meal.
Till my next review......CHEERS!!"}
