{"text":"The meat is always very juice and delicious. Not a fan of the buns, but what prompted me to give 3 stars is my last visit when I ordered a side salad with my meal. I got like five leafs of lettuce and not much of anything else. My husband even commented on it when he saw it and he never complains. Perhaps it was this one time but when businesses cheap out on things like a salad it angers me because I don't enjoy paying crazy amounts for a burger meal to be given 5 pieces of lettuce...and I'm not even talking about full leafs of lettuce, I mean the cut up type."}
{"text":"Dear Owners: Try washing the sinks in the men's washroom...oh and putting soap in the soap dispenser also goes a long way."}
{"text":"Normally on the weekends I have fencing class from 2:00-4:00, so me, my mom and sister some here to grab a quick bite before I go to fencing class. To be honest, the first time that I came here I thought it wouldn't be good. But, I ordered the vegetarian burger and it was amazing. Also, the staff were really nice and gave us these cute little condiment dispensers that looked like ketchup bottles. Aside from that, I've came here about 5 or 6 times, and it's been great every time. But if I had one suggestion, then it would be to clean the bathrooms a little more. Also it's located in a very continent location which allows us to go and do other things like shopping, because there is a Dollarama nearby, which we generally go to after we eat. 4 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Hit or miss burger joint. They forgot to put any condiments in my burger last time. However, I've been going to this location everytime I crave a burger and it generally satisfies. I was dissapointed when I found it they were frozen patties but hey, it's angus beef!"}
{"text":"In my opinion Hero's Certified Burger is one of the better fast food burgers you can ask for. The meat is 100% free range Angus Beef which they claim is antibiotic, hormone, preservative, and additive free. Between their quality of beef and incredible selection of toppings, one can put together a beautiful burger. 

Hero's burgers come in 4 oz, 6 oz or 8 oz sizes. In addition to the beef burgers are a couple chicken breast sandwiches, a salmon filet, steak sandwich, soul burger (veggie), and hot dog. Truthfully I have only ever tried the beef burgers although I'd love to try the steak sandwich, they say it is aged for 30 days and accompanied by sautéed onions and chipotle sauce, arguably my 2 favourite condiments. 

The competitive advantage of this restaurant is their selection of gourmet toppings and condiments. For example, if we're talking toppings or more specifically cheese you can choose from: Blue Cheese, Gorgonzola, Swiss Emmenthal, Brie, Smoked Provolone, Hero Canadian Cheddar and Goat Cheese to top your burger/sandwich...Nuts eh? 

Other toppings include: Premium Canadian Peameal Bacon, Portobello Mushrooms, Guacamole, Fire Roasted Red Peppers, Coleslaw and Sautéed Button Mushrooms. No charge condiments include: Maple Chipotle BBQ sauce, Mighty Caesar, Creole Mustard sauce, Hero Certified sauce and all the other standard condiments. 

So imagine what a juicy 6 oz burger with Smoked Provolone, Maple Chipotle Sauce, Creole Mustard, Fire Roasted Red Peppers and Red Onions would taste like, pretty solid in my opinion. Sometimes I get the poutine but the fries tend to be well undercooked, so I ask for them well done and it makes the world of difference.   

Like I stated at the beginning, this is a stellar fast food burger. The customization and selection of toppings at fast food pricing is what makes it what it is. If you want to try a real deal Holyfield burger, you'll need to hit up a venue such as Johnny's or Allen's."}
{"text":"This is the third Hero location and again I am disappointed. The chicken burger was small, and the sweet potato fries were soggy. My son's hamburger was OK and his fries were soggy as well. I would expect a bit better for the $25 but what can you do when teenagers are the staff on hand."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about this burger joint. That holds true until my last visit which was a month ago. I have been to this burger joint in quite a few places but decided to review this one as it is my first one.

The portions are bug and if you ever try their combo which is slightly less than $10 you will never consider those small overpriced combos in other popular burger joints. The burgers come in variety of sizes (4oz., 6oz., 8oz.) and there's a hefty list of condiments and toppings which is sure to fit anyone's choice. Now, the beef burgers are good but my favourite item on their menu is the Wild Alaskan Salmon Fillet. It is just delicious !"}
{"text":"Great place to get vegetarian burger. It's fresh and tastes good. Most other places have dry wafer-like hard patty but here is a different story. \"Soul Burger\" is the best and I love Mango Sauce & additional toppings of portobello mushrooms and pineapple. Onion rings are the best here, fries are great too."}
{"text":"The good - Best choice is the 6oz Hero burger. Thick, juicy and surprisingly flavourful. Sweet potato fries are tasty and crispy  Way better than their regular fries. 

The bad - the Soul veg burger sucks. Hard, dry and tasteless. The 4oz slim Hero beef burger is actually thicker than the Soul veg.  For the price stick with the beef."}
{"text":"It is our go to Burger Joint when we are up that way. You can get the burger in a size that my better half will enjoy, and you will a nice list of toppings, and good sides of either fried onion rings, or french fries.

I have tried other Hero location, but in this one, it seems the owner is hands on.  Their meat is tasty, and they manage to serve up a juicy burger, every time.

This is not gourmet, but its good! Devan has also mentioned the advertised quality of the meat, and the fact that is Angus Beef. All of that makes this place my choice for burgers when it comes to a franchised chain."}
{"text":"One of the worst hero burger ever! This owner is probably a cheap-ass and cut down on all cost! No special Coke machine (they only have a dirty old Coke machine). No Heinz ketchup.. The ketchup dispenser was old looking and they used dollar store container to hold the ketchup cups. Burger taste old and not fresh at all! Never going back even though it ta close to home!"}
{"text":"This is a filthy place. When I went to the washroom I saw the cook in the kitchen texting, and when I came back he was putting the lettuce on my burger barehanded... do you know how many germs are in a cellphone?
The washrooms were dirty, walls were full of stains and scratches. Burger was OK but meat didn't seem to be fresh, more like frozend and quicky cooked.
Was it good? Don't remember... it is hard to enjoy the food in that place (and with the image of the guy handling the lettuce after texting)."}
{"text":"Hero Certified Burgers have become one of my favourite burger joint franchises in the city.  I eat here at least once a month and always get the signature 6 oz combo (4oz and 8 oz also available).  

Interestingly enough (and similar to what another reviewer said), even though it is a franchise i've found that some locations have better tasting food than others.  For example, I have 4 Hero Certified Burger locations within a 10 minute drive of where I use to live but I prefer the taste of this location vs. the others anyday.  (Other locations include the Yonge/Weldrick location, Elgin MIlls/Leslie location and Commerce Valley location)  

Not sure why, but the bread always seems fresher and the meat is extremely juicy.

The one major negative I do have is that I love a bit of hero certified sauce on the side to go with my fries.  The owner running the Major Mac location always wants to charge extra for it when every other location i've been to gives it to you for free.  

Otherwise, it's a great burger franchise and I'd highly recommend trying it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This may have something to do with the shortage of burger joints in Jersey that are halal, but I absolutely loved the burger!! 

This is one of thos places non-halal eaters can enjoy and indulge because its that tasty. 

I mean its also healthy... (enough, kinda). 

I'd skip on the fries, and just get two burgers if you're that hungry. I got the classic along with my husband, and ALTHOUGH the person taking our order got confused and didn't know if we JUST wanted jalapenos or if we wanted the jalapenos on top of the classic other topics (lettuce, tomatoes, onions)... he still apologized and gave some sweet potato fries for no upcharge (the fries were tasty).

Their sauce was awesome too! I added a chipotle sauce as well to the burger and that added the extra zing.

Honestly though, this burger had ENOUGH flavor just by itself that it would have been fine with nothing on it and the flat bread they offer to health concious eaters.

When I'm in town, we will definitely be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"If you're in a mood for a quick Burger it will be a great choice!
Huge selection of toppings to satisfy any taste.
I would recommend adding Goat Cheese to any other toppings you are getting, their goat cheese is really good and melts perfectly on top of all the toppings! 
It is differently better than other Fast Food Burger Joints such as MacDonald, Burger King and Wendy's."}
{"text":"This location used to be a decent place to grab a bite. The interior wasn't very appealing, and the owner seemed to be quite cheap, so I didn't go back for a long time.
I went back yesterday with a friend, and the place has hit rock bottom. I heard that the owner changed, and the people working at the back were different as well.
The new guy working in the back kept staring at us, and it made us feel incredibly uncomfortable. He kept coming to the front and interrupting the cashier while we were ordering - who does that?
We were also charged for dipping sauces for our burgers and fries. The ancho chipotle sauce used to be complimentary when you buy sweet potato fries, but not anymore. This new owner seems even cheaper than the last!
When we got our burgers, we decided to enjoy them at home, but when I took my first bite, I realized that the guy in the back gave me the wrong cheese (blue cheese instead of Swiss, even though it said \"Swiss cheese\" on my receipt) and the meat was BURNT. That new guy seems so inexperienced. 
It's easy to say that I'll never come back to this location. It's the worst hero burgers I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I am a big addict when it comes to trying new burger joints around the city.
I have tried so many, but always seem to go back to the specific hero location, when I just need a GOOD burger.
You can never go wrong with their burgers, Always juicy, beefy, and freshly prepared.
Wide variety of patties, condiments and sauces with some holiday special Cajuns promotions, like turkey or veggie burgers..
My favourite pic is a double 6 ounce patties, with their hero size, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms..
If you are in the area, and craving a good fat juicy burger, this will hit the right spot."}
