{"text":"Not bad...better than the place in there before. Good subs, pretty good pizza. Delivery or pick-up only."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed their pizzas and the delivery service is great. I'll be ordering from them often."}
{"text":"Good food
Friendly owners 
Fast delivery
If you live in the area give this family owned business a chance."}
{"text":"I love their Buffalo Hot wings. It's hard to find good wings and I'm ecstatic that I tried this place today and loved their wings. The hot sauce just has a great flavor. I will be a regular going forward."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best hot sauce in this area....hands down. The owners are great, friendly and awesome service - even delivery.

The menu is large so there's something for everyone. The pizza is pretty good, the sandwiches are great...but the wings and hot sauce are out of this world.

On the down side....a little expensive.  I would frequent the establishment more often if it were cheaper.

Great place though!"}
{"text":"Not the worst just bland. got 2 phone calls asking for directions and the order was not correct. Also pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The wings are always under cooked and gummie even if you ask for them well done. The salads are basically rabbit food served with frozen grilled chicken. Is it really that hard to use a fresh chicken breast? They don't use mixed greens, they use FINELY shredded iceberg that looks l Iike a taco topping. 
The old man who always answers the phone is one of the most miserable rude human beings I have ever spoken to. 
It is all around an awful place to order from. It has really gone down hill the past few years. If you want some good pizza shop food, steer clear of Bishop's."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was very good and the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"Not sure why people talk bad about this place. I own a business that they will deliver to and we get food from them at least 2 times a week. Might be a little ore money but worth every penny. Ignore the bad reviews on here. This place is one of the best food places out there.."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops"}
{"text":"I called to order a delivery for lunch on a Monday, the woman who was working there picked up the phone and just put it down without saying anything to me. I could hear her talking to someone else at the restaurant and never said anything to me, just left me on the phone sitting on the counter! Super rude and unprofessional! So i waited a couple minutes and called again. The second time i called it rang a few times then disconnected. So then i waited a couple hours and called again. This time it rang a couple times and someone picked up and then immediately hung up on me! I guess they dont want my business?! If i was the owner of this place i would fire who ever was working the phones. Unacceptable! Its your job to take orders and make food. Hanging up on a potential customer isnt going to make you any money or get you good reviews."}
{"text":"Babysitting this weekend, I asked what pizza to order. Bishops !! was the only suggestion answered. I was glad to hear it. 

This is not my first taste of Bishops Pizza. The location close to home closed, so we are forced to travel to get a good pizza. 

The pizza has always been consistently good. Different from the other pizza shop pizza that is out there. I like the hoagies as well. The Cheese Steak & Italians have always been our go to hoagies. 

The delivery was fast and professional. The women taking the order in the phone was pleasant to speck to. 

The Italian was a little toasty which is. It the way I like it, but it was good none the same. 

Highly recommend for those in the area and those willing to pick up."}
{"text":"Been ordering from them since the early 90's. Always hot and fresh.  Best white pizza I ever had. Hoagie's are great. Burgers with curly fries with cheese is always a favorite. Sometimes they don't answer the phone for what ever reason, but when they do its great."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best around, i will drive from Mount Vernon to holiday park to pick up Bishops...And it's worth it. Just great pizza, wings, hoagie etc... 5 star easily."}
{"text":"Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!"}
{"text":"They are never open on Sundays... even though they are supposed to be.. I am starting to think maybe they folded and are out of business"}
{"text":"The pizza has really great flavor. I loved the sauce; however it was slightly undercooked so it was soggy and difficult to eat without a fork. Will probably try again though. Maybe we just had bad luck. Also got the buffalo wings. Ordered them extra crispy and they were extra crispy. Sauce was good. There were a few several broken bones, but not sure that this is the shop's fault."}
{"text":"The food is great. We often order the pizza and hoagie special. 

I gave three stars because the phone service is TERRIBLE. The past three times I have tried to call to place an order I have been unable to get through on the phone, only to drive to there and find that they had either taken the phone off the hook or were just ignoring the phone all together. I have sat in my car and tried to call and watched them just completely ignore the phone ringing. They make it very difficult to order from them!"}
{"text":"Pizza, wings, & hoagies are all good.. Everything is overprice. The employees are extremely rude every time I pick up food. It's a shame.. Because of this, we have been trying other pizza places"}
{"text":"Bishops used to be the best pizza place around but anymore, it is mediocre at best! It really just depends on when you get it. Some days it's better and other days it's not. The taste and quality isn't consistent. Just recently we ordered from bishops and the pizza did not have a lot of cheese and the crust wasn't warm or tasty. It just tasted bland. I know that this particular location has been for sale but still operating, so hopefully new management can turn this place around and make it as good as it always used to be!"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering here since I was a kid and we've never had an issue. Now I'm an adult, and live about 30 minutes away, and I still order here and make the drive to pick it up. 

Great, great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great people delivery is fast and food is always hot.  My kids always want Bishops"}
{"text":"Very good food - it never disappoints.   Delivery always comes hot and warm and in a pretty quick amount of time.  Decent menu selection and variety.  Friendly employees and great customer service too!   I would definitely recommend you give their food a try if you've never orders from them before."}
