{"text":"My husband and I frequently visit the 5 and diner on 75th and bell and love it.So last weekend we were in the area and decided to try out this place. I ordered a lemonade and when i took a drink it tasted like plastic it was awful and im not a picky person I asked for something else because it tasted weird and our waitress tells us how people have been complaining about the taste and sending it back. .. so I guess that's fine for me to get served it right???. It takes over 20 minutes for our food my husband ordered a sandwich and I had a burger nothing fancy .. there were only two other people in the restaurant so it wasn't busy. My burger was so Nasty I barely could eat it my first bite was a chunk of gristle the toppings were really sparse like a quarter of a slice of pickle and a chunk of lettuce!..honestly ive had better burgers and service at McDonald's and that's saying something! I wouldnt eat here again if I was paid to it was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious Cobb salad, chicken was tender, everything was delicious, including the two breakfasts enjoyed by my kids. Prepared perfect."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday.  The banner out front said they were under new management, but I have to agree with Mary L. in that we'll go to the 5 and Diner at Arrowhead before we'll go back to this location.  My veggie sandwich had one enormous piece of cucumber (not thin slices that would actually make sense in a sandwich), but was otherwise what I expected.  Nothing fancy, just veggies and cheese on bread.  My daughter's grilled cheese was better, but her fruit cup was a little weird.  None of the ice cream, fountain, or dessert choices were in the menu we wer given and our server didn't know what wet fries were.  My husband's cheeseburger was fine, but nothing to get excited about.  I didn't see a jukebox and the wait staff all wore jeans and T-shirts.  How is that \"Delux\"?  Maybe it's that they serve beer and have a TV with football on?  I have no idea.  Regardless, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Well if I had to sum this place up in one word it would be, BORING.  There's nothing really wrong with it but there's certainly nothing great about it either.  It is located in that weirdly painted little strip center right off of Bell Rd.  I know some people love the paint scheme, I'm just not one of them.  Anyway when I think of a 5 & Diner I think of a retro, 50s style place with little juke boxes at each booth etc.  Not here.  I guess they are trying for a more upscale look but in my opinion it didn't work.    The menu is very much like the traditional 5& Diner's.  We were there around 11 am on a Saturday and ordered breakfast.  My wife got an omelet and I had the BIG breakfast (3 eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and biscuit).  The food was good my wife especially enjoyed hers so no points off there.    Our waitress was pleasant but not overly attentive considering there was more wait staff on duty then there were customers in the restaurant.  Both of our drinks ran dry before she offered to refill them.  Kind of a pet peeve of mine but not a big deal.  With the economy being the way it is and so many restaurants trying to hang on that deserve your business I would give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Nikki and Angie are great!!! Good food, great service. My wife and I always enjoy visiting our friends at the diner."}
{"text":"Not a lot of great breakfast places out in Surprise. We tried this place out about 2 weeks ago...I was surprised the place was so dead, especially considering we went at 9am, thinking we'd catch the late breakfast crowd. Coffee was fresh, skillet breakfast was tasty and portions we larger than I expected. Pancakes and sausage were good, too. The place still looks new and is very clean. Prices seemed reasonable, too. If you're looking to grab a bite to eat in the area...give it a try."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a Sunday morning after church for breakfast. We're used to waiting 30 minutes or more on Sunday morning, but at this restaurant, we were seated right away. Now we know why. The food was mediocre, at best, the service poor and the menu is not as good as the regular 5 & Diner on Bell in Peoria. When we arrived, only 4 tables were occupied. You would think we would get great service, eh? There were more than enough servers, 4 or 5, and 3 cooks in the kitchen. We had to continually ask for refills of our drinks. Our server was pleasant but I'd rather have someone who didn't talk with me but was prompt and attentive, then a friendly server who was poor. In fact, one table of 6 got up and left because no one approached their table to serve them. When our checks came, they were mixed up with one person's drink on the other person's bill. (There were only 4 of us on 2 separate checks. How hard is that?) WILL go to the 5 & Diner again, but it'll be the Bell Ave location in Peoria, not this one."}
{"text":"This was our first trip here.  There was one table getting ready to leave as we sat at our table.  \"Easter candy girl\" (as Allie dubbed her) was our waitress.  She was polite, attentive, and quick with the refills.  She was eating candy again, but that was not a big concern as they were poppable pieces, not a melty chocolate bar melting on her hands.  Mr. Jeans and Tattoos was present also.  Seeing as he is the cook, the attire holds little importance.  Our order was taken, cooked, and recieved quickly.  There was some light joking going on about our order in the kitchen, but it was over jalapenos and handwriting.  I laughed it off.  There were two other gentlemen in the place who didnt do much.  One sat us and the other was tossing candy.  That I could do without.  We arrived at 430 and the setting sun was not an issue.  We ordered nachos, a texas burger, a tiny burger, and a kids grilled cheese meal.  Our food arrived hot and tasted good.  The price was very reasonable.  We will for sure be back with live country music and 99Â¢ kids meals on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Great food, prices, and service!! The food took less than five minutes to come out and Kellie gave amazing service!! Also, this location is a Delux so they sale alcohol"}
{"text":"I had the Uptown Eggs Benedict this morning and it was one of the best I have had and that includes ones I've had at high end French restaurants  The service was top-notch ,the food was fresh and,all in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"wanted to eat before church.  Had a two for one.  I had the chicken fried steak my friend had chicken fried chicken.   excellent. i recommend this place for breakfast. the waitress Shelli was top notch.  she made sure my eggs were just the way I like.  She is a peach    they open at 7 am you can sit insidenor out.   defiently try this place"}
{"text":"With a nearly empty restaurant, we still got horrible service. Mediocre food. Enough said, will never go back."}
{"text":"Local little diner with good food and friendly wait staff. You will always see the same faces. I have been going once a month for the past few years, always ordering breakfast. It's good, served quick, unless you get a Sunday after church rush or another type of big party. From every seat, you can take a peek into the kitchen and see the cooks working their butts off- same with the wait staff. There is nothing on the menu that is craveable, it's just a diner, but it's a nice change from the big chains in the area."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my family and have enjoyed it both times. Their omletts are big and come with a good amount of toppings and reasonably sized side items. Will.go back again."}
{"text":"My sister and I were looking for a great diner in this area and came across this lovely one with excellent service right away from Angie and AMAZING food to go along with the service. We definitely  recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Stangely this 5 & Diner isn't in a \"diner\" car, it's in a strip mall and is a little harder to find when you normally know what a 5 & D looks like.  The food seemed just as good, on this day it was slow (customer wise) but out food was timely and of good quality & taste.  Next time in the area we will certainly consider a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Was this awful or what? I have never ate at a worse diner! Table was sticky when I asked for cloth she ran across once with dirty towel and still sticky and wet! Only people in place and waited a long time for food! The French fries were so salty!!! Tea had refrigerated taste with very little ice!!! I will never return!"}
{"text":"This is the worse restaurant with the worse wait staff, worse food and worse service of any place that I have been to in the 2 months that I moved to Arizona.  If you go, be aware of the evening sun, there are no blinds  on any of the windows and the restaurant faces the west.  The hostess is not bashful about seating you facing directly in the blinding setting sun.  When I went to their web site to voice my dissatisfaction, I was under the impression that a company rep would contact me within 24 hours.  That was a week ago; so I guess that a lack of service runs from the top down."}
{"text":"Get it to go corned beef and hash or where it go like 2 bites what a rip off. If you don't want to do deliveries just remove it horrible"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I\"'ve had.  Parisian omelette  -- perfectly toasted English muffin,  tssty tomato  (sub for potatoes),  tasty eggs.  And great coffee!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Just ok, cheese wasn't completely melted on omelet. Amber server woulda been better pretty sure if she wasnt the only one on or if the mgr on duty was better. He tried to give me a burnt english muffin after waiting 15 mins for it. Glad this place isn't one that I crave."}
{"text":"good morning im heading up there to meet a friend for breakfast I  been there a few times  not a bad place  have a great day everyone"}
{"text":"Don't do it!  The service is quite good...unfortunately that's where the good ends. Everything on the Fried combo platter appetizer tasted like it had arrived at the restaurant frozen and battered....then battered again. Not good, because somehow the inner layer was not quite cooked. The fried fish was so greasy it left a greasy taste/coating in my mouth. Not pleasant at all."}
{"text":"Pretty much your typical diner. I got two eggs, bacon, 2 biscuits and gravy and hash browns for $13! Pricy for basic breakfast fair if you ask me.   Staff was very friendly! I sat on the patio with my pup and my server gave him a bowl of water instantly! Very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my brother this morning. Service was great and the waitress \"Kelly\" was funny. Food came out fast and cooked perfectly. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. I will definitely make this my weekend breakfast place."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. My friend said his burger was the driest burger he's ever had. I had a Patty Melt which was absolutely disgusting. There was barely any meat on it . I was hungry two hours later. I wouldn't go back there if they paid me to eat there."}
{"text":"Yummy! Service was great, even for an empty restaurant!  Me and my grandmother both got meatloaves. The meatloaf was moist, and delicious I had fries with that, and they were perfect. Even the veggies were nice, dipping them in gravy.  This was our first visit, and when I save money, we will visit more."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that it is not in a diner shaped building- there isn't much difference between 5 & Diner Delux and the regular 5  & Diner.  The menus are pretty much the same with standard diner fare. The big difference is supposed to be that they prep there own food, but I couldn't really feel the extra love in my bacon cheeseburger.  I guess the biggest dissapointment was the fact that my chocolate shake was made with vanilla icecream and chocolate syrup. This produces the same flavor as a fast food shake and the steep price of $4.49. A chocolate shakemade with chocolate ice cream is just more authentic and really what this pregnant lady was craving at the time."}
{"text":"Ok, we have ow given this 'joint' three tries and they are OUT!   First visit, about two years ago, it was decent, had potential, but slow service and the food could have been something neat but just missed the mark by being boring, bland, and overpriced.  Second visit, about the same but the service was so slow, complacent, and deplorable that we were just grateful to escape.  Final visit ever was three weeks ago.  We had the unique pleasure of watching our waitress eat Easter candy behind the counter, with her bare hands, then serve food without washing. Another customer had an issue with the food preparation, quality, and handling and requested to talk to a manager. They scraped up some guy from the back wearing dirty jeans with tattoos and hickeys on his neck to play this role... When she finished airing her concerns, the staff congregated at the counter to piss and moan about her, make fun of her, mock her, and justify their poor skills, behavior, and bad attitudes to one another.  This was simply appalling to watch!  As this drama was taking place, I see our plates hit the top shelf in the kitchen. They appear to possess our fries, kettle chips, and buns/bread. They sit, and sit, and sit while everyone in employ counts their cash, chats about anything but the business of food service, and did I mention the Easter candy eating?????? Yeah, our food server of the year is mowing through that bag as if her life depends on it and giving commentary about its tasteful wonders... Still.... Are you kidding me?????  I see our proteins land on the bread and our ever diligent server addresses them with garnish immediately after finishing her candy and not washing her hands! Awesome!!!! At least this experience will boost my immunity... Kinda like eating mud pies and drinking from the hoses when you were a kid...  So here's the issue, the burger and chicken sandwich were good, damn good as a matter of fact. We ditched the bread, it was cold and nasty, but the proteins were fabulous. Too bad the fries were cold and the kettle chips burnt to the point of no return, then both had sat so long they were soggy, chewy, just rancid.  Our server, remember her? Good, glad you did, because she could not seem to remember us... No beverage refills... No checking on us... Nothing.  We have to flag her down to ask for the check. She looks at our plates, with bread, chips, and fries still on them and asks if things were good. The main main says the bun was clearly from a bag and not even toasted and the fries cold and chewy. She declares this to be too bad and tells us she is going to give us a coupon for a free shake on our next visit.  Oh, whoa, stop there... Next visit? What was so impressive about this visit that we would spend our hard earned dollars on a next one???? No offer to make it right on the spot, that day, that moment... But a 'hey stupid, come on back for a shake so we can neglect your health and welfare and treat you like crap' coupon. We never asked for this, we responded honestly to her inquiry and got a patronizing response. And btw Easter candy queen, did we order anything dairy? What makes you think we would be appeased by a cheap dairy treat?  We paid, we left the coupon for her to use as she appeared to enjoy sugar laden treats, and departed. Never, ever, to return again. How do businesses survive in this economy with such negligent, dangerous, lax service?????"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today.  Love the 50's style decor and huge booths to dine at.  We had the Chicken fried steak, and Eggs Benedict.  Both were large portions, served hot and with hash browns.  Cooked perfectly, we were pleased with our breakfast.  They give you a coffee pot to have at your  table which is great cause you don't need to wait for the server.  And, our server was funny, friendly, courteous and very professional.  We were pleased..will return"}
{"text":"They closed the Arrowhead 5 & Diner location leaving me to come to this location. First off, they are only open until 2 pm!  (Forget having dinner here! Thought this was a diner!)  Second, restaurant was nearly empty but service was nonexistent. Food was mediocre and not like that of the Arrowhead location.   Burger patty was generic and bland while being unevenly cooked. Cheese was too small to cover the patty. Fries were the only good part.   Location does not have the music jukeboxes and the waitresses don't wear the \"poodle skirts\". It definitely doesn't have the 50s motif that 5&D is known for.   So sad!  This is not the 5&D that I loved!"}
{"text":"Really, I don't know what people are complaining about?? I have been here several times and each time the service was outstanding! I give the service five stars for each time. They were almost full to capacity today at lunch, and the service was still great!  The hamburgers are good with a good smokey flavor (not the best on the planet, but good)...the breakfast is very good (love the ham steak breakfast and the chicken fried steak breakfast) and the Reuben is ohhhh soooo good! They have a senior menu, but I don't think you have to be a senior to order off of it, so that is nice if you aren't a big eater or want to eat cheap. They have more choices for kiddos on their kids' menu than most places!  We'll dine here for breakfast and for the Reuben for sure, and eventually we'll try more items and I'll report on them later. The Reuben is outstanding (and I've had lots of Reubens in my lifetime). This one has o'plenty of thick slices of home cooked tasty corned beef. The (non canned) sour kraut was grilled (yummy!!!) prior to being added to the sandwich, the quality swiss cheese is thick and melty, and the bread is thick dark rye. It came with a pickle spear and choice of side for under $9.00.   I'd give this place FIVE STARS, but I haven't tried enough items on the menu because we are stuck on breakfast and Reubens!  Give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"If there was a negative star rating, I'd give them that. I asked if the corned beef hash was good, she said they sold a lot of it, so I ordered it. HUGE mistake, it's canned and tasted like dog food, looked even worse. So I returned it and got 2 eggs over medium, sausage links, hashed browns and toast. Only the toast and sausage were even edible. Eggs weren't even cooked, hashed browns were so burned I couldn't even cut into them, second round of hashed browns were not cooked and mush. My daughters food was cold and way too small, as were all the portions, they didn't  fill up my elementary school, super skinny kid, so..... Our server was Nikki, super sweet, tried hard to fix it the best she could. Manuel,  the cook, was GOD AWFUL, AND has no business in a kitchen unless he's doing dishes, because he cannot cook to save his life. We left and had to find another place to eat, because I couldn't eat my meal, and my kids was too small, FYI, she ordered a regular plate, not a kids plate."}
{"text":"New modern restaurant with an old diner feel.  Clean and bright.  Great service and excellent food.  Had a fun time."}
{"text":"Patrons with a trucker hat, moustache, and thick longsleeve plaid shirt?  Nope, not at this diner.   Why not?  Oooh!  A \"delux\" version of 5 & Diner?  Yes, it's called 5 & Diner Delux and there's only two of them in the country, according to their website.   I inquired about the difference and my server said she said that they prep their own food.  Hmmm... makes me not want to eat at the other 5 & Diner locations now!  This location is on Bell Road on the north side in the relatively new strip mall development on a corner.  It's more spacious than most 5 & Diners, and the patrons are much different as well, in both appearance and age.  Staff was mostly teenage kids who provide minimal service, some with face piercings and some without.  Not sure why those in charge of hiring would find this ideal for a customer base of retired folks.  Pancakes were moist and light, and their syrup had a good maple flavor.  Hashbrowns were golden brown but on the oily side.  Prices reasonable.  Parking is ample."}
