{"text":"Horrible. The water we got was clearly unfiltered tap water. The gyro was cold, my daughter's fried fish was still frozen inside. We gave it back and they brought the same cut apart piece back after frying it again. Of course it was overcooked, dry and hard now. The chicken soup was sour from too much vinegar (who puts vinegar in chicken soup anyways?). 
Eventually they counted my son, who is less than a year old and only eats his baby food as the sixth guest and therefore added 18% gratuity to the check for this bad service.
Never again."}
{"text":"Was in Tempe on a short visit, stopped into My Big Fat Greek and had 3 varieties of hummus, a garlic, red pepper and another i can't remember. All three were delectable, flavorful with 'love'. Actually was quite stuffed just on the hummus trio order. My main lunch item was the Greek salad, see photograph. Vegetables fresh and dressing balanced. Overall a wonderful lunch dining experience. Can't wait to go back someday and have dinner ! Our server was very jolly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Phoenix area, so I'm still compiling a list of favorite spots, and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant definitely makes the cut! It's reasonably priced, and they serve fairly large portions. 

I went with my Dad and cousin, and we split the Fat Greek Combo, which was huge and contained a variety of their appetizers. The stuffed grape leaves were honestly the best I've ever had. I also tried the lamb and beef souvlaki, which was good. It would have been better if I had ordered it medium rare instead of medium, however. 

The place was clean, and the waitstaff attentive. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nothing Greek about this place. The ownership has changed and traditional greek dishes have been revised. Since when does moussaka have squash. The greek salad had lettuce and I had to hunt to find pieces of cucumber. Spare yourself a visit. Big fail."}
{"text":"I want to give BFGR 4.5 stars - food was delicious, service impeccable, great atmosphere. The only thing stopping it from being 5 stars was the vegetables with the main - they were okay, but just boiled/steamed and plonked on the plate. 

They stuck out amidst an otherwise excellent meal -  the fried zucchini starter was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The beef and lamb souvlaki were tender and delicious and the lemon potatoes were full of flavour and perfectly cooked.

For dessert we had the baklava cheesecake which was amazing. Fresh, light, sweet - shared between 2 of us and was perfect.

To top it off, the service was excellent - Nicole was friendly and informative, and we were greeted by other staff and the manager.

Great experience, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok... my second Greek food review of the night. I went here with my husband and some friends the other night and the food was really good. The service was good... I was expecting a little better atmosphere for a such a large sit down restaurant in such a prime location.  It was pretty tacky in the decor and a tiny bit worn around the edges. It does have a bit more than Greek food on the menu, but let's be honest folks...\"authentic\" food from anywhere in the world almost always translates to strange, bland and/or even un-sanitary. Also truly authentic food doesn't sell. Travel down to Mexico and see how much you enjoy authentic Mexican food. Not the tourist places, the real stuff. 

It's good Greek/American food. Not great atmosphere. 

Pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"One star for service. The service is the worse I have experienced in Scottsdale...so far. The waitress was not sincere and I had to get up and check on my own glass of wine. The \"X boyfriend\", which was suppose to be one of their best drinks, was weak and thought it would be much stronger. The food did make up for the service but it was a celebration dinner and didn't make us feel like it was even a Saturday....let alone a celebration at all."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside and that is about it. Our waitress was extremely accommodating. However, it's  expensive, the bar was out of items needed for menu listed drinks and the bar tender failed to inform the waitress and instead sent out a supplemented drink, the limes and mint used for my mojito were brown and slimy. The shrimp was over cooked, hummus wasn't anything to brag about and I didn't get my change. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain. Wouldn't mind better service. The place was empty, we were being rushed, waitress tried to bring appetizers then 2 minutes later main course! Overall on a scale of 1 to 10 they would get a 7.5"}
{"text":"We used to come here once a.month but the last two times...food was not as good ... service was awful."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much not . good. I got take out not wanting to cook. The grape leaves were soggy and flavorless with some thin cheese melted on top. The fried zucchini was a cheese laden mushed up breaded greasy disaster - overly heavy. The falafel are huge, but dense and exceedingly over oiled...much like everything else. The only reason it gets 2 stars is good friendly service and good hummus. The Greek salad was okay, but the dressing was heavy. I felt like there was lead in my stomach after eating here. For well over a day I lost my appetite. Even the feta seemed fattier than normal feta. My house smelled up for about 24 hours. 

Go to Pita Jungle. it's right down the road. I'm sharing on FB so my local friends can know what waste of money this place was. The charges for this standard of food was disastrous."}
{"text":"I visit Tempe a lot and stay near Mill, and I try to visit this place whenever I have a chance. I usually get the gyro platter, and in my experience every element has always been cooked just right. The yummy food and the cheerful service have been good every time I've visited, which is impressive considering how often staff turns over at any restaurant in a university town. And yeah, this is a Mill Avenue restaurant, and the ASU vibe is strong -- if those things bother you, well, you probably aren't reading this review anyway. Me, I'm a big fan of this place, and I look forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Went there last night and the place was closed. It closed down about two weeks ago.Too bad their food was good."}
{"text":"I've had much better Greek food in Chicago, but Tempe is not Chicago! 

The flaming saganaki is always fun for Greek food newbies, and the $6-7 lunch specials are tasty with both the gyros and chicken souvlaki. The Greek salad comes with a nice amount of feta on it, although they're a little skimpy with the olives. I don't go very often, but service at lunch has always been just fine."}
{"text":"It pains me to give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant 2 stars. We usually have phenomenal service and delicious food, but today's experience was out of the ordinary. We had Susan as a server this afternoon and she was just awful. It was 15+ min before she returned to check on our drink status and we had to ask for more water and tea at that point. She gave us an excuse about the food taking too long because of the kitchen (we weren't actually concerned about the time the food was taking).  The food came out probably 25-30 min after we had ordered, a little long for lunch time, but we weren't in a rush so it was okay. When she came back with the third entree we asked her for a couple of sides of tzatziki (that were ordered with the entree, but not received). She came back 10 minutes later without them. I asked her if they were out and she admitted she just forgot. When she came back with the credit cards she apologized for the kitchen a second time and I told her that it was not the kitchen, but her service that made our lunch experience a bad one. She got about six inches from my face and in a threatening voice said \"I'm sorry sweetheart\" then walked away. 

I spoke with a woman who was a server and said she was the manager about the experience. She apologized for the kitchen as well and said she would take care of it, but her tone of voice and excuses for the kitchen (even though I did not once complain about the food) did not inspire confidence. 

I got the Chicken Caprese Pita lunch special with a Greek salad. My green salad was a little on the bland side, but decent. The pita was phenomenal. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the balsamic sauce was delicious. Both gentlemen I was with had the gyro lunch pita and the meat was cold for both of them. 

We'll be heading back to Saba's to satisfy our Greek cravings in the future."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Lemon Wedge

Stopped in a few nights ago on a whim, remembering flaming cheese and a great time I'd had at another location 2 years ago. Unfortunately this last time has relegated MBFGR to an appetizer and desert place, which means we probably wont be back. By the end of the evening, I felt like I'd spent the entire time sucking on a lemon wedge, both in the figurative and literal sense.

The evening started out slow. We sat there for a good 7 minutes before our waitress came over for drink orders, and it seemed to set the pace for the evening. Every time she came back the first thing out of her mouth was, I'm sorry I forgot about you. Yeah, thanks. 

Starters were Saganaki and Dolmades, with a pre-order of spaghetti and meatballs for the little one. The cheese was as good as I remember, and hubby said the dolmades were the best he's ever had. 

Main course for me was the Chicken Souvlaki. I was asked if I wanted to get two different skewers, so I ordered one beef, one chicken. The menu does state that if you split the skewer order that you might be charged a little bit more. I figured an extra buck or two for the beef. However they charged the full price of the Beef Souvlaki which is a FULL $5 MORE THAN THE CHICKEN, and was completely not worth it. The Chicken was so dry, I sucked down half of one of their giant glasses of ice tea trying to eat it and gave up on the last piece. The beef was properly medium and even nicely charred on one side. Unfortunately that was the highlight of the plate. The sauce on the meat was too heavy with lemon. The dry potaoes, which are supposed to be garlic and lemon, were missing the garlic. The dry rice was under done and again had the overpowering lemon. The same thing with the veggies. It was like the kitchen had forgone the standard seasonings of salt and pepper, and dunked the enitre dish in a vat of lemon juice, to the point that not a single thing on the plate other than the beef (and it had to fight for it's life) had any other flavor than lemon.

Hubby orderd the Gyro Platter. The meat was extensively dry, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. His meal came with the same sides as mine, and he experienced the same lemon issue. 

Sadly, the only decent main dish was my son's spaghetti and meatballs. The meat again seemed to miss any form of seasoning, but the sauce did make up for it, along with the tiny garlic breads that came with it. 

Despite the horrible main course, we opted for desert after seeing something flaming that was put out with caramel? Really the only reason I went for it was to lose the taste of the lemon wedge smile. We ordered the Galaktobouriko, and it was out standing. The bad news? They added lemon to the custard. Yeah. 

I left feeling like I'd experienced a lemon Sunkist commercial where you have a fire hydrant explode in your face to demonstrate how intense the (insert random fruit name here and add a y at the end) flavor is.

It's a great place to hang out and maybe meet for appetizers and drink, but hey, it's Mill Ave and there are better restaurants within walking distance. I wish I could give a more favorable review. Truly, if it wasn't for the Saganaki, Dolmades and the Galaktobouriko(barely), I'd be giving it a 1."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times during the AZ tenure.  Always came in a group, which is the way to go for greek dining.  I suggest the flaming saganaki, or the dipping combo for starters.  The Gyro platter for an entree never disappoints!  I hope to come back sometime."}
{"text":"Flavor packed jalapeño and cilantro hummus!!  The roasted garlic is amazing as well --served with warm pita triangles!  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"went to this place for a late lunch with friends( party of 4). got service immediately from hostess . the waitress brought our drinks then continuely hounded us for our order!! we like to sit and enjoy a cocktail or 2 and visit before eating so she was very annoying! I ordered the chicken pita with Greek salad  _ the pita was so full of onions and very little of anything else that I had to remove most of the onions and cut up the large pieces of dried out meat so I could eat the sandwich. someone should teach this restaurant how to make a Greek salad because this restaurant s Greek salad is a joke!!!  It had one olive and maybe a teaspoon of feta cheese and so many onions I had to remove over half just to eat the salad.  DONt go there!!! prices were OK but food terrible!!!"}
{"text":"this place used to be great. I just went and got the calamari Greek salad and I might as well have eaten frozen calamari with iceberg lettuce. There were no Greek olives no feta cheese specs of tomato and iceberg lettuce it was horrible. I recommend you go anywhere but here. And the only reason I went was because of the two reviews on the calamari salad fron may which were inaccurate."}
{"text":"The meat lovers plate for two is wonderful!! Heck there is so much food it would be a great plate for 3 or 4 people. The food is always fresh and very tasty!! The humus and chicken are my favorite in the plate! Make sure to check in to YELP to see if you get any deals before check-out!! 

We really love this greek restaurant (We wish there were some in CA) but when we are in AZ we make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch and  this was my first visit. The .menu offered traditional Greek food as well as pizza and burgers.
I enjoyed the devil burger and my wife had the greek pizza.

Both were very good and the ingredients were fresh.

We will be back to try more items in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here Easter evening, I had worked all day so I didn't have time to cook dinner after getting home at 6:40pm, they were open and despire the 3 star review we decided to try them. The waitress was super friendly, the food was delicious. I didn't know what to order so I ask the waitress what was good, as I don't know Greek food. She suggested the Pastitsio, it was very good, and very filling .I couldn't finish it. 
The atmosphere was fine but nothing high end or fancy, but we were not looking for high end. I don't know if it's a Mom and Pop shop but it has the feel of one, and the staff was wonderful. 
I'm a fan and we will be returning again."}
{"text":"So.....we gave this restaurant another try this past weekend and they did a better job!!  The manager remembered my boyfriend and I and offered dessert on the house as a peace offering.  The service was better, food was good as before and we enjoyed ourselves like the first time we went.  Go on a weekend and you should be good!!  At least they made it right - can't ask for much more than that!!"}
{"text":"What a sad and unfortunate mistake it was wanting to come to one of my favorite places on a recent trip back to AZ. Rather than reminisce about how it used to be I'll stick to the most current debacle.

1. We never got a refill on our drinks.

2. Our waiter never came to check on us (that could have remedied #1).

3. Our food came out COLD - not a little warm, not cool, COLD. All of us (five adults, two kids) ordered dishes with meat and not a single one was hot. Not being completely ridiculous we decided not to eat the potential parasite-feast that was presented to us.

4. Upon voicing our unhappiness with the temperature of our food and lack of anything to drink our waiter, quite rudely I might add, said we'd be taken care of.

5. \"Taken care of\" means 10% a bill where 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, a kid's meal, and 5 drinks were ordered of which, conservatively, 9% of the food was consumed.

I can't imagine the problem was a busy staff since there was one other table of patrons while we were eating. Even IF they were slammed how can you serve COLD meat? On top of that you think 10% off will make up for five plates of food poisoning?

I wish I would have done something I've never done before and made a big scene and walk out

Are these guys just trying to emulate the fall of Greece (ancient or modern)?"}
{"text":"I love this place and it may be because of the Greek Fires - lemon and feta are SO much better than ketchup. The rest of the food is pretty good too, whether it's the the gyros, moussaka or chicken souvlaki (which I admit was on the dry side a time or two) I have yet to be disappointed in anything."}
{"text":"I've spent a semester in Greece and been to many Greek restaurants. The gyros at Big Fat Greek are very good - huge portion for the price and I definitely recommend the \"greek\" fries (although I never had anything like that in Greece). Perhaps not as interesting or tasty as the gyros on the streets of Athens but still supremely better than most other Greek restaurants. The avgolemono soup is also very tasty and would recommend that if you need an appetizer, although normally just the gyro by itself is more than enough food. Unfortunately the new location is smaller than the old and the last time we visited the temperature inside was uncomfortably warm and the service was slow. You can typically pick up restaurant.com coupons for this location."}
{"text":"I am so SAD this restaurant CLOSED. The one in Gilbert as well. It was one of my favorite places. Loved the lemon chicken soup and Lamb souvlaki. WHY????!!!!"}
{"text":"this place is decent. i get to-go for dinner a lot when i'm at work since all of downtown phoenix closes at like 3. the athenian spaghetti is awesome, and so is the white pizza. however, you never know what you'll get here. sometimes it completely sucks. i brought my lady here once and her falafels were harder than rocks.

also most of the food is way too expensive for what it is. 10 dollars for some spaghetti with a few herbs and some butter? 

ryan is a great server though."}
{"text":"My boys and I went here last night.   The waitress was very nice and funny.  We ordered some drinks and I ordered lampchops and a salad it was absolutely amazing.  Without a doubt the best lambchops I have ever had.   They literally melted in your mouth.   The drinks were also great and my water was amazing.   The location was great.  It was funny to watch all the drunken idiots walk by celebrating Cinco.  I will def be back."}
{"text":"I like this place I am Greek so I know what home made Greek food from yia yai tastes like, I had the gyro dinner it was good but the lamb meat was a little dry.  My wife had the pastisio which was tasty but a little greasy Greek patatos were good but needed a little more lemon on them...all in all I like it there oh and the flaming feta is great."}
{"text":"As a bit of a jaded and cynical individual, I feel I should begin by suggesting that you not be dissuaded by the campy name.  The manager seems to genuinely care about his establishment, and it shows.  The Slouvaki alone is well worth the trip.  As someone who considers feta cheese his personal kryptonite, I feel I would be remiss to not suggest the feta burger.  The wait staff is VERY attentive and helpful.  Combine all of this with a clean and attractive atmosphere, and you have found a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Our order was wrong.   The food was a tad cold when we got it.    The portions weren't very good for the price.  We kind of felt ignored by the waiter.    The gyro meat was dry and it seemed old.  Not a very good experience so we probably won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"We eat outside in downtown Tempe, nice environment, good and handsome server Joe. I got lamp chow, the most expensive one, but only 17 dollars, which is much worth it, I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. The service was too slow. We dine with friends and family each paying separate bill, but waitress charged us 18% gratuity which i don't mind paying for good service and if we really are in big group. (family of 4). Debit card was missing (2). Ice on big cup up to the rim, 5 zip of drinks gone! Gyro was dry. Wait for for was 45 mins..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Greek food and not only does the food taste pretty good but it's a great fun atmosphere as well. The portions are huge so it is no problem sharing but my only complaint AGAIN is the lack of *Greek* children food items. The portions are so large, though, that it isn't a big deal for my son to just share the food from my plate. But chicken fingers at a Greek restaurant????

I can't even remember all of the dishes we have had at this restaurant but they were all good. My husband always enjoys a gyro, their hummus is delicious and the feta fries...YUM.

I didn't feel out of turn bringing my sometimes loud-mouth son to the restaurant since it is pretty loud there already. So, keep that in mind."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for reverse happy hour for some appetizers and drinks to start off our night. We sat out in the patio which was nice because it was more relaxed and open than sitting inside. Our waiter was super cool and checked on us frequently. The happy hour drinks are pretty cheap and the cranberry vodkas I ordered were pretty strong! (always a good thing)

The greek fries were good (pretty standard)

The tuscan tomato hummus was amazing (I order it every time)

The bruschetta is also very good (I order without cheese) and it's still amazing, I like how they give you marinara sauce on the side to add. I hate dry food. 

The waiter even brought us out a free baklava dessert which was also great!"}
{"text":"My gyro was boiled, disgusting! I have eaten at this same restaurant chain in Tempe and it was great. The food at this location is horrible. I doubt it is run by the same owners.

The restaurant smelled awful too, like rotten eggs. Another thing worth mentioning is the floors in the men's bathroom was really dirty.

Avoid this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great salad! 

How about making fries from fresh potatoes rather than using frozen ones?  Or is it the owner's opinion that we at Gilbert don't know any better?"}
{"text":"This was a great surprise. I had never been to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant before and after walking up and down Mill Ave for awhile I decided to step in and look at the menu. I really wanted a Gyro but I resisted because I knew what they tasted like! I opted for the chicken caesar pita with fries and it was delicious! I was SURE I wouldn't be able to eat it all after the large meal landed in front of me but let's just say I am glad I got the fries! The pita is cheese crusted and the fillings are fresh and tasty....fries were awesome too. What a deal at less than 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious however their Greek lemon chicken soup was the best I've ever had. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch. I've spent a lot of time in Greektown in downtown Detroit, so I'm very familiar with good Greek food. The atmosphere is fun (like most Greek spots), and servers were a young, attentive, and attractive group. The food is pretty good and there was a large enough crowd to justify the 18 minute wait for my meal. All in all a pretty good lunch spot...heard that the expanded happy hour really packs 'em in, so naturally I HAVE to go back to get my OPA on!"}
{"text":"We've had good experiences dining here in the past but usually the atmosphere is fun so we thought we'd give it another try.

Empty restaurant yet we were seated at a tiny table for three people.  It was a full 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged that we'd been seated or took a drink order.  Another 10 minutes for drinks to arrive.  Food was mediocre at best.  Gyro meat was cold, hummus was just off (though I've enjoyed it here in the past).  There was so much dill on the cucumbers and salad that I couldn't eat them.  My pita came with onions though I requested none.  We had to ask for additional pita bread twice times and by the time it arrived we'd finished our dinner (the extra bread was to go with our appetizer).  Noone ever asked if everything was OK and we had to chase down the waiter to get our check to leave.

Sad to see what was a fun spot suffer at every level.  Poor service, lousy food and nothing that would bring me back.  I suspect it's a matter of months before this location goes out of business like most of the others.  There appears to be a complete lack of management."}
{"text":"I eat at My Big Fat Greek almost every Tuesday and have
very good and attentive service from our server, Edna.

Gail"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Greek salad as well as the jalapeño and cilantro hummus. I arrive and Im told that they forgot to put the order in. I get home and realize that the chicken from my salad is missing and my hummus was regular. Not a great first impression and the food was average at best."}
{"text":"Don't judge this restaurant by it's semi-cheesy name... It's authentic greek and so very good. Good service. Great food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Brought my daughter to the restaurant on Saturday lunch and sat at the bar. After 10 minutes of being totally ignored we left and won't be back. The place needs a manager ."}
{"text":"Went to the re-opening night after hearing it was all day happy hour and was craving fresh pitas and hummus.  Me and two friends waited 15 minutes for water and there was no sign of the waiter even though the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived.  They then proceeded to bring us hummus that tasted sour and after another 20 minutes we received new hummus because the waiter claimed that too much lemon was in the first hummus they served us.  We didn't get a chance to put in our order until about another 20 minutes (so we have been seated for more than 40 minutes at this point).  When our food finally came out, specific order preferences had been overlooked, I nearly spit out my soggy calamari and the bruschetta was mostly just a giant piece of bread with old tomatoes.  After an hour of waiting, we didn't really expect to be happy with the meal but this was a bit much!  Drink orders finally arrived and we no longer even wanted them.  The manager came over and was very understanding of our issues but it didn't compensate for an already ruined night.  She explained that the waiter was new and his section was the biggest.  For an order that consisted of 5 appetizers and 2 drinks, we were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half.  Wouldn't recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick and relaxing meal."}
{"text":"The food here is great and you get a good portion size for the price. The service here is also great. Dusty is very nice and very helpful in explaining the menu. A great atmosphere to come to if you see around Mill."}
{"text":"Best pita bread of my life! I decided to grab lunch at My Big Fat Greek on a whim last week. It was the best part of my day!

They had a HUGE menu, but I ordered the strawberry salmon salad. It was so delicious that I literally savored each bite. My waiter was attentive by not overbearing, and I got free parking with my validation (woot!). I would certainly come back here again and order lots more pita."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week using a Restaurant.com certificate.  It turned out to be SO good.  We had the Gyros Pita since we both love REAL gyros and we were not disappointed.  Having spent many years living in the Chicago area I am used to Chicago's Greek Town so kind of expected to be disappointed.  Loved it.  And the rest of the menu looks very interesting.  We will definitely return.  My only complaint is that they only had 2 handicapped parking spots and we had to park quite a ways from the door which is not fun pushing a wheelchair.  They need to add a couple spots."}
{"text":"Gyro Pita was a disappointment. The pita was hard on the edges and did not seem fresh. The sauce was very sour.  Do not order Greek Fries...they were old and soooo bad.  They used old Oreida crinkle cut fries The table was dirty and as I was eating, a fly crawled out from under the plate. 
Go to the one by Chandler Fashion or express location on Kyrene and Warner."}
{"text":"I actually ate at the one that is located in Chandler Fashion Square. It's a bright, friendly atmosphere. The prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious! You can get the full dinners if you are hungry enough, but they even have pita sandwiches alone for reasonable prices. The Gyro meat is excellent. Be sure to also have the flaming saganaki for an appetizer!  OPA!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat her 3-4 times a week, after we finished our walk through Tempe. We have our standard fare that we order and really looked forward to them re-opening. BIG disappointment. We've gone back 4 times and each time gets worse. The wait staff is horrible and unattentive, the portion sizes have reduced dramatically and they now charge for every little extra, e.g. extra dressing, pita bread with salad, etc. The side gyros dish is a third of the size it used to be. 

We will not be going back! Now to look for a new place to eat after our daily walk."}
{"text":"I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.

I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on."}
{"text":"We had a big group and everything was delicious.  Love the flaming cheese!  There is a platter called meat lovers or something for two that could have fed four of us.  One of the kids ordered the wrong thing and the manager graciously brought him what he had meant to order without an additional charge.  We really got excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"They haven't messed up my Gyro yet. Works for me. This time I also tried the grape leaf wrapped appetizer thing that the name of it escapes me. They were delicious. The night was perfect and we sat on the outdoor patio which made it even better. I'm always a fan of My Big Fat Greek Restaurant and I'm an even bigger fan of the waitresses and hostesses they hire. Ha ha ha. BOOYA!!!"}
{"text":"Walked here for lunch with a coworker who happens to be a vegetarian.  We both had the lunch special falafel pita with salad.  Deelish!!! Very good portion for lunch.  My friend said falafel was ok-  a bit undercooked since it was made as a big ball.  She did like it overall.  It was my first time having it and I thought it was good.  Worth the walk and I will come back for this same selection ;)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and my experience seems to get worse each time. While I love the service, I just feel like everything there is dirty. The menus don't seem to be washed down and upon going into the restroom this last time, there was gunk on the sink handles and the automatic paper towel dispenser wasn't working. After leaving the bathroom, it didn't matter what the food tasted like or how the service was. I just wanted to go home and wash my hands with rubbing alcohol (which is actually what I did right when I got home)."}
{"text":"Service by our server, Logan, was fantastic and the food was delicious, as always.  Been having lunch here for years as I work down the street and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I recently came here to grab lunch with a few friends.  We had a nice time and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Good food- we got a few entrees and split them to get a mix of things.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and food. I would suggest friends and family to give it a try."}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly.  Fresh veggies, homemade sauces great service. Waaayyy too much food, two more meals from the left overs going out the door with me.  Bar is separate so is family friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingy decent Greek food from a place that looked like shopping-center fare. The falafel wasn't terribly authentic, but all the ingredients were fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Excellent gyro on a pita with a tasty Greek salad...spot on!  Can't wait to visit my daughter at ASU - and dine here again!!
LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"We live close by and make a point to stop by here with some regularity. We've tried much of the menu and always have a good dinner. Our favorites have been the simple gyro pita/platter, chicken souvlaki, and lamb chops.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and it ranges wildly from empty to packed, like much of the Arizona Center restaurants. Service is always friendly and fast--even if it's pretty full. We recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Had a great experience from the staff to the food was excellent. Gyro platter with the yummy potatoes and vegetables were extremely flavorful. Very impressed! Topped that off with a baklava cheesecake.... If you traveled as much as I do, you will be impressed with this restaurant... Very flavorful food!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance and great service from our hostess Kiara.... We had a wonderful time there...."}
{"text":"How slow can a restaurant be? Certainly not slower than this place, despite being only a quarter full at best.  Some friends wanted to meet here for lunch today thinking we'd be out in less than an hour, but apparently that was asking too much, despite the fact that our horribly complicated order consisted of only two salads, a side of steamed vegetables, and a kid's meal.  After waiting so long for our order to be taken and to get our food, we asked for the check right away because we had to eat and run.  While we continued to wait for the check, numerous other tables got served and all the servers joined in a signature birthday chant at another table.  eventually they got around to bringing our check.  And then came the dilemma of breaking a $20 bill.  Nearly 20 minutes just for that.  WHAT were they thinking???  They weren't busy and there were plenty of staff around.

So onto the food...  I had the Village Salad, a chopped blend of onions, cucumbers, green peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc.  with no lettuce.  Very tasty.  In the past I've had the hummus - it's fine, and the tsaziki - it's fine.  The service at previous visits was fine.  I would have gone with 3 stars if not for the horrible service today."}
{"text":"We've tried a couple of the My Big Fat Greek Restaurant locations and this one several times. By far this one is the best. Wait time to be seated was short, the server was attentive and the food was served in large portions and was tasty.  The restaurant business is tough and everyone has an off day once in a while.  It's too bad that some yelpers base their negative comments on a one time visit experience.  We'll definitely be visiting this location again and again."}
{"text":"The service here is awesome, drinks are reasonable, but the food is really not worth the trip. Used to love this place for their good food, but since they had that fire couple of years ago food does not taste the same. I bet they changed the chef."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple other Big Fat's around. They are pretty much all the same. Which is good, when you are a chain restaurant. 

I came in for lunch. Was seated promptly, and approached my a server promptly. The food was even delivered promptly, which are the 3 most important things to have during lunch service. 
They have a $5 lunch special for any of their pitas, add $1 for a salad or fries. It's a fair deal. 
As for as lunch goes, the Tempe Big Fat did it right."}
{"text":"This is easily the WORST Greek food I've had in my life. Obviously mass produced as my chicken entree took 5 minutes to be ready. Extremely tasteless and my guest and I both left feeling like we would get sick. People are right that the only good part is the service, but the food, well we regretted eating it. How can you mess up a Greek salad too? The falafel, disgusting. I can't say anything nice really."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Seriously come see karl, amazing server. He'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had CLOSED. A new Greek restaurant has opened in the same building. Its Pita Kouzinos. Pretty similar menu. Great lunch deals- we had the gyro pita with Greek salad and roasted red pepper hummus. Tons of food, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered the tray of options that includes every meat possible. The service was attentive and the pricing was that bad either. Not my best greek experience, but for Phoenix it'll suffice. yeah, i said it....."}
{"text":"A recent trip to Phoenix brought us to M.B.F.G.R.  We had just arrived the night prior and had no dinner, and a very tiny breakfast, so my wife and I were very hungry by the time lunch rolled around.  Our friends took us here saying it was \"pretty good.\"  Honestly, both my wife and I thought it was phenomenal.  Neither of us are red meat eaters, so we both immediately look towards the chicken and fish menu sections of any restaurant we dine at.  We both decided to try the chicken breast entree.  (I apologize for not remembering the exact name of the dish.)  The entree consisted of two smaller chicken breasts, lemon potatoes, rice, and pita bread.  The chicken was extremely moist and tender with a great flavor to it.  The lemon potatoes were unlike anything I have ever had before.  Upon first bite, they tasted really sour, but the more I ate them, the more I wanted.  The pita bread was just your basic pita bread...nothing bad, nothing exceptional.  I stuffed myself so full that I left no room to try the rice.  We both also added the Greek salad to our entree for an additional $2.50 each.  Excellent salad.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was very very tasty!  The only reason that I would give this restaurant less than a 5-star rating is because they are not in San Diego.  We will be back next time in Phoenix.  Our total bill including soft drinks, tax, and tip was $40.  Great value for the quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"My Big Fat Fantastic Experience!  Yet again Jennica and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant have spoiled us like family!

We came in around 8-ish, the dining room was packed with a small wait.  We chose to enjoy the warm evening air on the misted patio.  It was perfect for our party of six, four adults and two children.  

We ordered our favorite the Fat Greek Combo, Zeus & Athena Beers and by recommendation from Jennica, the Greek Fries and  Flaming Feta, of course chicken tenders and spaghetti for the kids. The combo is huge, the fries indescribably delicious and just saying flaming feta makes my mouth water.  The kids...and adults loved the flaming presentation.

Jennica took very good care of us, the manager on duty even checked on our table and the owner Demetri stopped by too.  This staff obviously cares about the dining experience of their patrons!

We ate till our hearts and stomachs were content, who am I kidding, they were joyful!  And if that wasn't enough Jennica brought us out a dessert that was obviously created for a Greek God or at least a demigod or two. I'll do my best to describe in mortal words, vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sat atop fried sweet bread with honey and whipped cream.  It was incredible.

Definitely sit on the patio and ask for Jennica, you won't be sorry.  Maybe a little stuffed, but not sorry at all!"}
{"text":"Logan was a huge help to our party and honestly couldn't ask for a better person to serve our meals! Highly recommend this place! Thanks again Logan!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience at this restaurant tonight. I ordered lamb souvlaki with a small Greek salad, Mom ordered the spinach pie. We ordered two cokes. Waitress was very sweet, brings the cokes and a \"salad\" which consisted of lettuce, two cherry tomatoes, a few small bits of cucumber and onion with parmasean cheese on top. No Greek olives, no feta cheese. I ask for some Greek olives, waitress brings me 4 olives. Twenty minutes later we get dinner. Mom's spinach pie looks like a burrito with some cheese and chopped tomato on top. I'm Greek and we couldn't figure out what it was. We taste it and it's pretty good. Waitress brings me lamb chops which I didn't order. I tell her that I ordered the lamb souvlaki and she just looks at the plate and says \"oh\". Then says I should eat the lamb chops while I'm waiting for the souvlaki. I cut into the lamb chop and it's RAW. I mean RAW. I point this out to the waitress, she says \"oh\". Takes it away. Another 20 minutes later I get my souvlaki. The lamb is so tough and grizzly that I can't even chew it or eat it. I tried 6 different pieces, not one of them made it down my throat, I spit them all out. I show it to the waitress and at this point I'm starving and ready to leave and get dinner somewhere else. She suggests I order something \"quick\", some gyro meat on a plate with some rice and a side of hummus. I agree because I'm desperate. Two minutes later she brings me out the plate. It did have a lot of gyro meat on it but it was literally dripping with grease. I picked up the meat on the fork and grease literally dripped from it. I was so hungry I ate some of it anyway. The \"side\" of hummus was in a tiny cup, about a teaspoon's worth. I kid you not. The \"rice pilaf\" was rice that has some puree'd carrots in it. I didn't finish dinner but Mom and I decided to box it up and order a slice of cheesecake for dessert to split since I was still hungry, having barely eaten anything. We order the slice of cheesecake, waitress comes back and says they're out of it. We get the check, they were nice enough to take my dinner of the check but in looking at the check they charged.....ready for this? SIX dollars for a Coke! That Coke should have come in a gold glass. We've taken this restaurant off our list and won't be going back. I'm sorry to say that because there are very few Greek restaurants in this area and I'd like to be able to have Greek food once in awhile, but I won't go back to this place. The only \"grease\" in this Greek restaurant is on the plate!"}
{"text":"Hummus was just great. I've trident their \"special\" Greek wine and honestly didn't like it. Briefly - he'll of food worth the money."}
{"text":"This review is more about the service than the food.
My wife and I stopped in after a movie and decided to sit inside.  We got a waiter who seemed like he had given up on EVERYTHING, including personal appearance.  Most servers smile and have at least some enthusiasm when they say hi.  This guy didn't say anything other than \"can I get you something to drink\" in the flat, uninspired tone often heard at the DMV just before closing time.  Anyway, we noticed the same tone toward his other tables; not very welcoming and he should have taken the day off.  We dubbed him \"Mr Sunshine\" and wished we had gotten one of the cute smiling girls instead.\"  

Anyway, we ordered a hummus app which arrived in a decent timeframe.  We had also ordered the sausage pizza but I'm pretty sure we got one with what we thought was the gyro meat (lamb?)  Maybe that is their version of \"sausage\" but it seemed incorrect.  On our bill it said \"sausage and pepperoni pizza.\"  No pepperoni was ever found.  On the plus side it turned out to be really good so we chose not to bother Mr Sunshine about it, lest we push him over the edge.  Seriously, though, the pizza was fantastic.

Anyway, our waiter had mastered the art of doing the absolute minimum.  Even his \"thank-you, goodbye\" lacked sincerity and eye contact.  Maybe he had gotten some bad news before his shift or something; we cut him slack but tipped only about 15%.  I'm usually a 25% tipper when the service is great.

On another note, the popular flaming cheese really smoked up the place.  In the first 15 minutes we saw 3-4 mini-infernos inside the restaurant.  The smoke was so thick and noxious I thought I had come down with both emphysema AND cataracts.  I hope the employees aren't developing cases of \"black lung.\"  

Still, we'll go back sometime and sit outside; hopefully on Mr Sunshine's day off."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great variety of Greek and Meditteranean dishes to choose from. The Gyros are amazing and I LOVE the meat lovers platter. I highly recommend this place . You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We spend winters in Arizona and look forward, each year, to eating here.  We've always had great service and food.  The restaurant is clean and staff  friendly.  A shopping day in Chandler is not complete without eating Greek."}
{"text":"I always come here and to Sam's Cafe when I'm in town for business.  I LOVE this place.  Outdoor seating just like Sam's.  

The menu is so diverse with mediterranean food.  I typically get the Gryo pita which never disappoints and is so good and comes with the typical greek salad and also hummus!  I've also gotten the greek salad with calamari or chicken.  Always delicious.  This past time I got the chicken souvlaki which was juicy but for some reason I found it lacking seasoning.  The dolmades were okay, but not that great to rave about.  Same thing with the spanikopita.  

Definitely a place to go to when eating downtown."}
{"text":"Love it... can't get enough! There are always coupons in the circulating ads and hte food is so very flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"On 10/23/2012 my wife and I went for dinner and our experience was below par. This restaurant chain is one of our favorites but this location has seen better days. It was nice and cool outside and we chose to sit outside. We observed the patio decor is falling apart and needs paint. The wait staff and kitchen staff were not on their game. Ordered the Greek fries as an appetizer, the fries where chewy and stale. The waitress did replace them with hot fresh crunchy fires. Ordered the Gyro platter, was as good as usual but the Lemon Roasted Potatoes (my personal favorite) were overly seasoned, basically drowning in the lemon sauce, not much roasted, more like soggy. The waitress that helped us was inattentive and unknowledgeable. We will defiantly eat at this chain again, but not at this Mesa, Az. location. My advice to you, drive to either Tempe or Phoenix we have had great experiences at those locations."}
{"text":"I have only been to My Big Fat Greek twice, but already the bartender and the manager remember my name. The first time I came in, I'd had a long day at work and just wanted a salad and some saganaki. I was not disappointed at all! The dressing on the salad is absolutely perfect, not to oily and not to acidic either. Trust me when I say, however, that the small salad is plenty for one person or possibly even two people to have. 

The restaurant iself is eclectically decorated and cozy. Each time I have been in, everyone is in a good mood and you wind up making friends with not only the servers, but the other patrons as well. A very friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. They have great vegetarian options and the food is very fresh and clean tasting."}
{"text":"OK so you can't beat their 5 buck lunch specials. Now don't go in expecting awesome Greek food but it sure beats the hell out of subway for lunch. 

Happy hour is great the service has been awesome... You just gained a star THANKS!"}
{"text":"I will never go here again i went with my aunt uncle and cousin we specifically told the server i was a vegaterian i told her i wanted the veggie calzone and when i open it it had meat when i had it sent back they made me another one but this one was cold the cheese wasnt melted very dissapointed NEVER going back again you couldnt pay me to go there"}
{"text":"I was with a big group of people. And the restaurant was busy, but it took literally a whole hour for her to get me my check."}
{"text":"served with broken plates ,glases,we even have photograph taken for tha :P ..food was ok..will prefer hajji baba authentic cuisine over this"}
{"text":"This location tends to hire idiots as servers. We've had numerous occasions with socially impaired waiters. We've sat down at sticky tables, in direct sunlight, and next to the loudest group in the restaurant. 

One waitress failed to give us the happy hour menu or even mention it was happy hour, but then gave it to the table she seated right after us.

The food is 3 or so stars. Not divine by anyone's imagination, ok to speak the truth.

The major plus, is that it's in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was the first time for my bf and I trying Greek food. So we didn't know what to expect. The waitress was very helpful in explaining us the dishes. We decided to try a little of everything so we got a platter that included different things. We both thought it was delicious we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My husband got the braised lamb..so great! Everything was very good and our waiter Cameron was friendly and really on top of things for our party of 16!"}
{"text":"Good portions at a reasonable price. I honestly think you can buy one entree and split with a friend/spouse and have enough food for the both of you. I can eat quite a bit and still have enough food for lunch the following day.

The gyro platter was very good. The meat was well cooked and seasoned. The platter also consists of a nice portion of vegtables (carrots, squash, carrots), potatos and rice. You also get a few pieces of pita.

The hummus platter as an appetizer is excellent. There are 3 different types of hummus (regular, sun dried tomato and another kind that I can't recall). I wish they would provide more pita bread with the appetizer though.

You can choose to sit inside or choose covered outside seatiing. 

There is also a full bar for drinks.

Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I work nearby and love going here for lunch or for a quick bite at the end of the day.  Now, I haven't eaten that much Greek food in my days but this food is awesome.  The hummus and the flaming cheese appetizers are delicious and fun for the table.  The gyro platter and souvlaki pita are delicious as well.  The best part for me was the passion fruit iced tea which is served in huge cups with unlimited refills.  Can't beat that!

All in all, large portions, good food, mostly friendly waitstaff (one or two surly peeps but isn't there always?!)  

Go check it out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The inside is very well air conditioned to slightly freezing. We opted to sit outside in the shade. In 90 degree weather it was still very pleasant. Our server was attentive and thoughtful,  offering double vegetables to my gyro platter when I refused the potatoes and rice. The gyro meat was about 8 or nine ounces.  Ask for more dressing. It is nowhere near enough, and addicting!  Grin. Our server pleasantly split the cost of the appetizer between the two of us. Definitely earning repeat business!"}
{"text":"The food really good, and the service was great.  WE sat in the bar for a change.  More quaint than the restaurant seating.  We both enjoyed a gyro platter.  One shared could have easily fed the two of us, so we took the rest home for another meal.  I give it 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"If this is the one in the Phoenix Center, I would like to say that while the food was good and the atmosphere great (my first time going to the center) we were stuck with perhaps the worst waitress there. Though she was more than happy take our order for appetizers and drinks... once we said we are not sure about eatting dinner yet... she promptly took order and not until almost an hour later, brought our bill only because I asked th hostess. We watched as she chatted with other tables and visited them often, we were ignored. I had to ask the hostess for the waters that were to be brought to us and eventually the check.  The manager came over as my guest had to ask him for more pitas. Overall for not even a busy night, her service was deplorable. I would NOT be going back there but rather the Scottsdale and Tempe offices are a much better choice and awesome service.   Goes to show one, don't mention you want appetizers and drinks and will decide on dinner later... you will get substandard service. For what could have been a few extra drinks, dinner and desserts and a hefty tip for the waitress...we left having only one drink each and shared two appetizers... the hostess who was awesome got the good tip. Only wishes I would have gotten the name of the bad one. :)"}
{"text":"Now that they are back up & running, we tried again. Food is back to good & prices are decent. I don't feel like the service is where it should be, but I get it. I'm gonna go now & then, I like the food & location."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place for those that live in Ahwatukee!! The atmosphere is inviting and the people that work here are awesome!! The food & drinks are splendid!! You will be extremely happy with this choice!! Niko is the best bartender!"}
{"text":"We've had dinner here several times over the past few years. It's changed recently and just doesn't seem to have the same ambiance that it once did. They used to
play Greek music and periodically the staff would dance throughout the restaurant. None of that happens anymore. It used to be lively and fun and the food was always really good. 
On our recent visit, the restaurant was nearly empty. The music from the speakers was Spanish guitar, not Greek. It was loud almost to the point of annoyance. The  service was swift and the food came out piping hot. The meat was tender and the lemony potatoes were very good. The grilled vegetables were disappointing. They consisted of bland yellow squash, and a chunk of carrot and broccoli. The portion sizes seem to be less than they used to be. 
It's not a bad choice when you're in the mood for Greek food, but sadly it's just not anything special."}
{"text":"It's not bad Greek food - it just doesn't deserve any OOH-PAH!s (which in Yelp speak means \"this place doesn't deserve any more than three stars\").

Not to brag ...but I *know* Greek food.  I've been to Greece twice (once to celebrate the Millennium in Athens and the other was to be married on the Greek island of Corfu on the Ionian Sea).  

So again, I say, the food isn't bad.  I get Chicken Soulvaki or Spanikopita and Ross usually orders Moussaka.

If I were to recommend a Greek Restaurant in Phoenix -- please try Greekfest.  Although the name \"Greekfest\" is almost as cheesey as  \"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, the food is 100x better. 

The thing about chains is that you get a consistent experience and you can find them more readily.  So for that, I think  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is just fine - but it isn't special."}
{"text":"just finished te best pita i had in a long time my wify that is not a pita aficionada, love it!!! we will definetly come back also the service was friendly fast and prompt !! thank's big fat greek reataurant for a good experience"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The dining room was less than half full but it took  over an hour to get our food, server never took a drink order and we had to ask for silverware and napkins after our food arrived. I asked if I could speak to the manager and was told there was no manager on duty, this was on Friday evening about 8pm. This used to be a good place but has gone down hill quite a bit.  Apparently owner doesn't care since they didn't even have a manager at a time you would expect to be a busy night."}
{"text":"Stopped by because they had a great outdoor seating area and big fan to keep the air moving :) Happy hour was great and I enjoyed the saganaki. But more importantly, the spanokopita tasted like my moms and I scarfed down the cheesecake baklava. Great food and service. Thanks Kosta!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to MBFGR for a few years while going to the Chandler Mall area and have always had great experiences. I'm not very adventurous, and always end up with the gyro platter (a ton of gyro meat, tasty potatoes, and steamed veggies...almost enough for 2 servings) and a side of greek fries. Food is reasonably priced, service has always been good, and the most important aspet, the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Working downtown there are several choices for lunch and My Big Fat Greek does a great job and has a diverse menu."}
{"text":"Great Greek experience ...everything was delicious ..server was very friendly Jazmine  took care of us!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite - my dining partner hadn't been before. Samplers the falafel with hummus. Great hummus!! I had chicken souvlaki pita, he had gyro pita. Both with Greek salads. Shared an order of Greek fries. They also had a special of $5 sangria. Food was fresh and delicious. The fry toppings were great, but I wasn't nuts about the fries themselves. Our server was Madison, she was awesome!"}
{"text":"WAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! This location is CLOSED!!!!!! WTF man!!!!! Always had good food and fun here. Actually, enough food per serving for us to split. The most fave item on menu, the GREEK FRIES. OMG! Seasoned thin cut fries, crumbled feta cheese, some amazing sauce drizzled on top. Well, guess we have to find the next closest location. Hope experience is the same."}
{"text":"Here for conference.  Convenient location, attractive setting. Service was fine (not exceptional). Calamari and Greek fries a virtual sodium fest. Saganaki was good. Three humus platter a disappointment - they only had one flavor left. Over charged us, we had to have the bill corrected."}
{"text":"We began our dinner by being seated in an area with ongoing construction, so while we were studying the menu we already enjoyed a generous portion of drill noise and sawdust. The restaurant in general looked like a crossover of wannabe-hip Athenian nightclub and American sports bar. Drinks: I was originally drawn here because one of the reviewers on yelp complained about having only Greek wines to choose from. Having spent many summers in Greece I love Greek wine, however at MBFG I was sorely disappointed because I was unable to find Retsina on the menu. While two people in my group went for a glass of Kretikos (at a staggering price of $7 each) and got a huge glass filled with a little bit of wine, I went for the Passion Fruit Iced Tea, which tasted decent and was huge, however it was watered down by the berg of ice it came with. We also got some water, which tasted as if the aforementioned construction was also going on in their pipes. Food: It might be that my standards for Greek food are too high, but to me MBFG was trying to be authentic and failed big time. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, however she was Albanian and had never heard the actual Greek names of the food. Asked if their village hummus was like fava, she responded by telling us of what hummus consisted. And while it is nice that they had three different kinds of hummus on their \"MBFG dips\" platter, I feel the need to point out that hummus isn't really Greek but Arabic. I wish they had offered some skordalia, fava and/or melitzanosalata instead. This would have also solved my second problem with the platter, which was that I was pretty sure that at least half of their dips were not made at MBFG, which is sad considering that they charged $14 for it. Our entrees were huge, we had both the Gyro and the Souvlaki platters. Sadly the highlight wasn't the meat but the small side of potatoes that was the only authentic tasting food I had here and the saving grace for MBFG. The gyro while OK tasting was not authentic and didn't come with enough Tzatziki. The Souvlaki was well seasoned, however it was covered in a strange white sauce instead of the traditional (and much more delicious) lemon juice. For $13 I would have also expected more than two skewers and some actual tomato rice on the side instead of the strange rice they served. Needless to say we left without ordering dessert and won't return. If you want Greek food go elsewhere, the only thing Greek about MBFG is their background music."}
{"text":"Great food huge portions fun for the kids and a fun atmosphere. Belly dancer was awesome."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went in for lunch about 2pm for the $5 pita special. The time limit had passed by more than 20 minutes. Our waitress, Magda, said don't worry I'll ask the manager he's really nice and would let us have the special anyway.  We ordered the hummus appetizer, served with hot, fresh, soft, pita bread (absolutely delicious) and a falafal pita again in that fabulous pita bread, served with seasoned shoestring fries and tahini sauce ! Wonderful!
   The manager, Juan Ortiz , came out after the meal and we thanked him for letting us slide by on the lunch special and for the delicious meal. Their happy hour also looks good and we'll be back to try the happy hour soon !"}
{"text":"Amazing tzaziki. I was unimpressed with the salmon, but I guess I should've known better than to order salmon at a Greek place."}
{"text":"The food at this chain has always been consistently good. Our server in downtown (where we spent New Year's) was new, but that did not impact our service at all. She was prompt and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Other than having a great name, this restaurant was a welcome relief to the sea of Bar & Grill Restaurants in downtown Phoenix. The place has a nice feel to it and the outdoor patio is great. We went there twice while visiting Phoenix and the service both times was excellent. The best thing about this place was the amazing and freshly made Bruschetta! I had it both times :-)  

I also had the Caprese Salad, which was fresh and had a wonderful tangy dressing. My daughter had the Athenian Spaghetti, which she thought was 5 stars all on its own. 

So you may be wondering; why only four stars? Well I dropped it a star for the limited vegetarian options and the lack of felafels on the menu. 

Overall, great option for downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Service is always good.  Last meal I tried the mussels and was disappointed that they included broken shells and did not de-beard the mussels.  Too bad, because the food here is usually fairly good and consistent."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for happy hour. The food and drinks were great. We would go back for the hummus.  It was very loud, hard to talk. Service- what service. The most attentions we received was from the wonderful hostess.  The waitress was too busy working behind the bar. We would have ordered more drinks but there was no one to ask.  We had to go to the bar to ask for water and had to wait quite a while to get someone's attention for the check-started to think it was free.  Step up the service and it would be a nice place to frequent."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many restaurants that offer similar dishes, so am familiar with how good it can taste when done right. Ordered the chicken souvlaki, chicken quality was low, with a processed texture, very salty and poorly cooked. On the side potatoes and veggies, potatoes were mushy and again over salted, veggies unexciting over oiled. This is a diluted version of Mediterranean food, and unfortunately misrepresents the fare. $15 for my dish to make it worse. I can only hope that all the people that keep this place afloat, can one day taste properly prepared Mediterranean food, and realize what they've been missing."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many, many times. They must have had an inexperienced cook on the line. 

Vegetables were so overloaded with rosemary, that I felt as though I had put a rosemary branch in my mouth. 

Some sauce on the potatoes tasted spoiled, as did the yogurt sauce. Luckily, I did not become ill, I would have been very disappointed about that.  My friend  had Chicken Parmesan and the pasta was so over cooked it was like a paste. 

Told the waiter about the experience and his reply was \"I'll tell the manager.\" No replacement offered, did not see the manager. 

Had to ask for our waiter three different occasions, he was very, very inattentive.
I have never had this experience here in the past, so we MAY come back to see if they were just having a bad day. If it's not a bad day, they'll be closed soon."}
{"text":"We had the restaurant.com recommendation and certificate. . .We had  the gyro wrap, gyro dinner and euro platter. We enjoyed the dinner and the atmosphere very much. The waiter was attentive. Had an excellent evening. Would go again in a heartbeat. They are making me change my cuisine choice to greek. The cheesecake, NY and Baklava style was a perfect way to end the night."}
{"text":"Opa! I normally don't care for Greek food because I don't like lamb so frequently used in their dishes but this place offers plenty of tasty alternatives. My wife likes Greek and I  agreed to look at the menu online. They had lots of variety including steak, chops, chicken parm, pizza and calzones -- all with a Mediterranean flare.

The atmosphere is a cross between traditional and modern. Little hand painted wooden tables and blue cloth napkins with clean, open styling.

We went on a Sunday for dinner and it was about 1/3 full.

We were taken care of promptly. After mulling over the alternatives, i felt brave enough to go Greek. I ordered the Angus Steak Souvlaki dinner and my better half had the same only with grilled shrimp. We got a couple of soft drinks in cups so large you won't need a refill.

It wasn't long before we were served. Both plates looked great. Nice presentation. My steak was tender and juicy and my wife's shrimp were grilled to perfection. Other sides included potatoes, rice, veggies and pita triangles. (Maybe too much on the starches guys.). I recommend the Greek salad as a starter to add to the green balance.

Our server was attentive and very friendly. 

Overall nice experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Years ago, and I do mean years ago, their Mill Avenue location in Tempe, was outstanding.

As they expanded, the food along with the total expierence has gone DOWNHILL, big time.
Why has this happened ... they're doing franchising.  

I'm suggesting a name change:
\"My Big Fat Greek Disappoinment\""}
{"text":"Visited with my sister while I was in town. Waitress was forgetful, kept having to ask her to bring stuff we asked for when we ordered. Regular Greek salad had one olive in the entire salad. Greek fries were good but arrived a little lukewarm. Lots of loud seniors in the place but that wasn't ass annoying as having one olive in my salad."}
{"text":"Hugely disappointing. Everything was overcooked (and the chicken tastes like woooooood). They use store bought pita (which was gummy).  The manager said he wasn't sure why the chicken was so tough. I told him...I think it's b/c they cooked it for too long. Bust."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Greek food.  Huge.  And I will eat even really sucky hummus.  But I draw the line at really, really sucky hummus.  The sun-dried tomato hummus at MBFGR is better than the regular hummus, but none of it is great.  Their Greek salad wasn't good either, and their fries with feta (which sounds *awesome*) tasted funky.  I don't like giving a 1 star rating, and in truth this restaurant maybe deserves higher than a 1 -- perhaps a 1.3.  But because friends and dates keep dragging me there (the Arizona Center location, the Tempe location -- they are EVERYWHERE!), and I know I can count on a lousy meal each time, I have to go with a 1."}
{"text":"As others have stated... Portion sizes are huge but unfortunatley more doesn't neccessarily equal better.. 

I got the hummus trio & I have had better hummus... Although when you combine the bread, cucumber & hummus in one bite, it was much better...

I got the blackened salmon ceasar which I wouldn't really recommend... A relatively small piece of salmon for such a large salad... Bottom line... I've had better Caesar salads...

We also had the Chicken Souvlaki... While the Souvlaki itself was very tasty we didn't really care for the lemon potatoes... The Greek fries were different.. Couldn't really make up my kind... Not the biggest fan of Feta so that probably skewed my decision..

So, if I come back to Arizona... I won't put this on my \"must revisit\" list..."}
{"text":"We come here 2 to 3 times a month. I love the chopped chicken salad and their lamb dishes are awesome. The kids like the pizza and pasta selections and my wife loves the schwarma. Their sandwiches are great too - the chicken parm sandwich is wonderful."}
{"text":"I was waiting till I got back to Dallas to update all of my reviews, but this JOINT right here... LAWD HAVE MERCY on my taste buds because I am having a very inappropriate FOODGASM...First of all the people that work there are super nice and helpful..I ordered the gyro platter with rice and roasted potatoes...never in my life have I ever had potatoes so freaking awesome...now don't get me wrong the meat...pita...rice was all delish...but the true star are the potatoes....I typically stay in the Westin when I come to Phoenix, but I am tempted to stay in Tempe just to be closer to these potatoes...my new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Just wasn't impressed.

The menu has changed on a lot of things, and the new versions are just not awesome.

The Special Lady had the calamari salad, which back in the day came with big chunks of feta in it. Now, either President's Day means no feta, because George Washington hated cheese, or they've changed the recipes. I think the latter is more likely as GW was a well known feta fiend.

I had the gyro. Good meat, and that's where it stops. The tzatziki was weak. Not enough onions in the dish. 

And the service was poor. Our girl tended to mess up everything in our order. I asked for fries, got the salad. Now I understand I am a big man, and maybe she was looking out for my health, but don't get between a land orca and his french fries, you could lose a hand or a whole arm doing that!

Hopefully this was a fluke. I loves me some Greek food, but I might have to be looking elsewhere to scratch my fix.

As a post script, I also think I am going to pass a law that you have to have Grecian blood flowing through your veins to yell \"Opa!\" Just because you like to light things on fire does not give you the right to piggy back on a national identifier. Next thing you know pyromaniacs will site this in court as to why they lit fires, and as religion is protected under the 1st Amendment, its justified. I will not stand by for this unabridged anarchy!"}
{"text":"The lamb kebabs were very good, medium rare (as it should be), served with roasted lemon potatoes and grilled veggies. The gyros were served on fresh pitas. Generous portions. Good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time on Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised!  The gyro platter was a good value for the money ($12) and we were seated within moments of entering the restaurant.  Large serving sizes left us with enough food for tomorrow's lunch.  The atmosphere is quite loud, with several large groups surrounding our table.  Small patio area looked nice but it was a bit too cold for us to dine al fresco.  We'll be going back next time we're in the mood for gyro."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night and weren't too impressed. We both ordered martini type drinks, his straight up and mine was a Cosmo. Both tasted very watered down... very. Not worth the price. The food was just OK... not really overwhelmed by it. The Tzatziki sauce was very good so I will give them credit for that. The chicken wrap I had would have been better in pita bread instead of a pesto tortilla. My husband got the Gyro club and it was alright, although it was so messy and was a pain to eat since the food kept falling out of the sandwich style pita bread, that would have been better in a pita bread wrap as well. The meat was very good. We are still looking for a good Greek place since moving out here from the bay area in CA. Still miss our \"Opa\"!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here a lot, especially for happy hour in the bar area.  It is on till 7:00 and beats all the competition around the area.  (A good selection of food on special for 4.00 ea and inexpensive beer and sangria.)  The staff is always friendly, nice and helpful.  The surroundings are comfortable and we feel the food is good quality and very tasty."}
{"text":"Can here after a movie.  It was clean, and quiet. We ordered and we were very pleased with the service and food. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. I am the type of person that does not go out of the box when trying to new friends. I stay with my traditional foods. However, as soon as is tasted the 'Flaming Feta,' it made me realize that there probably is a lot more foods out there that I would enjoy. I have tried their Flaming Feta to their Pepperoni Calzones. They have there ingredients to a \"T.\" I would definitely suggest dining here for lunch or dinner. I promise, the staff does not let you down!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went tonight and there were hardly any tables. Sat without being even noticed for 15 minutes to be greeted by a waitress with an attitude and a manager that couldn't fix it. We had a water and a tea and she couldnt remember who got what. Really??  I decided to leave and spend my money elsewhere. It's too bad because we actually like the food there. This is a place to visit on the weekend. Not for a night after work when you have expectations and just want to be taken care of. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"the food was not what i expected.  to start with i ordered the veggie shish-kabob.  the  lemon potatoes where mushy and did not taste fresh.  my husbands gyro meat was extremely dry and had a weird after taste.  i wanted to like this place but wont be back after this experience."}
{"text":"I left the waiter (Daniel) a decent tip, but he decided to up it to about 30% on his own after i left.  I found out about it when I got my credit card statement.  This is not just dishonesty, it is larceny.  These are people willing to break the law and steal from you."}
{"text":"A nice ambiance and great hummus.  Pizza was tasty.  Service was very good.  We will definetly be back...."}
{"text":"This Greek restaurant is a great place to eat.

We were in Scottsdale for weekend trip and contrary to some other reviewers - we found both the food and service top notch and professional.

Greek fries are incredible.  Bruschetta was very good.  Ice Tea was actually brewed and served in swimming pool size glasses.

Too much food - very good value and we took chicken wrap home - was just as good next day.

So if you are sick of eating in chain restaurants, this place is for you.
I wish they would entertain opening in Dallas, TX."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always thought that I wouldn't enjoy Greek food, so I tended avoided My Big Fat Greek. However after my cousin's wedding we decided to go here for lunch.

We started off with a trio hummus appetizer, and it was delicious. It came with warm pita and a generous amount of each hummus dip. A word of caution though: The Garlic Hummus is very garlicky. We liked it, but I don't think everyone is as insane as we are when it comes to our love of garlic. 

I got a chicken souvlaki with a Greek salad for my side, and it was amazing. Not to mention the meal kept me full all day. To end it we got an order of Baklava to share and I could've eaten the whole plate. I haven't been able to go back since then, but needless to say I keep thinking about it haha. 

It's a must for those of you who like Greek food. For those who are unfamiliar with it, be prepared for the high amounts of garlic and onion in your food. It's not so much that it's bad, but if it's not something you're used to, you could be a little thrown off taste-wise. The lemon potatoes are as they say, lemony, so keep that in mind too. But please order the baklava. That is something you won't regret. 

I hope this review helps!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here while on vacation in Phoenix. We absolutely HAD to eat there after the aromas from the restaurant reached us while we were walking by on the street. 

We were both offered drinks right away. The waitress was polite and interested. Our food arrived very quickly even though the place was packed with a line around the door on Saturday night. 

We had the angus beef kabobs and the braised lamb. The plates were huge and the food was really great. I have eaten really great Greek food in so cal and this place rivals the both street vendors and five star restaurants alike. The beef was so tender and had great flavor, it was served with pita, lemon potatoes that rocked my world, rice and a lemon garlic yogurt sauce. I ate everything on my plate and would have kept on going if it weren't for the dessert, will get the that in a minute though. 

My friends lamb was falling apart it was so tender. I wasn't thrilled with the way it looked, but it was braised and not seared so there isn't much to do about that. I am not a big fan of lamb but this lamb was the best I've ever had. No gamey (sp) flavor at all. She had the same sides as I did, but she also ordered a Greek side salad. It was simple and not very big but the flavor was outstanding. Something about the amount of feta and fresh oregano made it unlike any side salad I'd ever had. No cheap ice burg lettuce and bottled ranch here. It could have stood alone as a main course with chicken or beef on top and I would have been a happy camper. 

NOW....dessert. Man oh man...Baklava cheesecake with warm honey drizzled all over it. All I can say is that I have searched high an low for a recipe like this ever since I got home. But no luck. There isn't anything out there like this. It was sweet and creamy the warm honey was the perfect pairing for this dessert. I am in California but I would gladly drive all nine hours just to have another slice. SO good. 

The prices were a bit higher than we were looking to spend for dinner especially in a college town, but it was worth it. 25 bucks a person including drinks, and dessert of course."}
{"text":"The beautiful view of mill avenue from my table was simply breath taking as I was waiting to order to my food. The patio was in top notch shape, the waiters were friendly, and the Patstitio was amazing. Pasta drenched in spaghetti sauce, topped of with some meat was really the cherry on top of my meal. Not to mention the great side dishes consisting of roasted potatoes, healthy veggies, and rice. The meal for one could have single handedly been shared upon two people. The great appetizers were one of the best parts of eating at the restaurant, the delicious hummus served with a side of pita bread made me feel like it was home. The Mediterranean decor and Greek music set the tone for the atmosphere perfectly. I really felt as though I was transferred to a different culture and a different place. The service was exceptional; the waiter was attentive to our every need, checking on me several times throughout the meal to ensure my satisfaction. Overall my experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant was an enjoyable one, and worth every penny OPA!"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to this place for many years.  Quality of food and service has declined steadily.  It used to be a fun place with great food.  Last time we went there we said we wouldn't go back because the food just wasn't good anymore.  Well tonight, we decided to try again.  Waitress did not want to wait on us from the get go.  I don't know if she had too many tables or what....it wasn't busy.  She did ok with the drinks and appetizers.  The greek fries were burned on the top, and the calamari was not hot and kinda chewy.  Calzone I ordered was burned on the top and undercooked on the inside.  Spaghetti and meatballs had no meatballs but sliced sausage.  The waitress didn't come by to check how the food was--and she forgot a 2nd beer order.  I told her I wasn't paying for the calzone and we saw her speaking with the manager who did not come by our table to see what the problem was.  Absolutely will not ever go back.  If you want greek, spend a little more and go north on Tatum to Eden's Grill."}
{"text":"Appetizer platter was large and tasty.
The galaktoboureko dessert was not good.
Although the chef is apparently Greek, he/she has made lots of compromises.  Or did not pay attention to his Yaya.
Service was super friendly."}
{"text":"Generally, I love Greek food, but not at this restaurant. We have eaten at this restaurant for many years and enjoyed the food and the ambience, but since it changed ownership, it is an entirely different. 
We sat in a booth and the music was Spanish, not Greek. It took awhile for the waiter to come over. When we placed our order for Gyros and a salad, we asked for the salad to be placed on a different plate, without bell peppers. The salad arrived on the same plate as our entrée with bell peppers and the gyros was very cold. 
When we complained, the waiter brought another cold gyros plate. Also, the zsizsiki sauce tasted as if it had spoiled. When we requested another one, it was much better. We never saw the manager when all of this was going on.
In the past this was a very pleasant place and we always felt welcome by the management and staff, always trying to please us. 
This is not the same place anymore and unfortunately we will not frequent it anymore."}
{"text":"Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. Hummus was a bit runny, but the pitas were fresh.  Our Greek salad was tasty, but too much dressing weighed down the greens. My husband and I had moussaka which was not heated/microwaved through out making it disappointing. I will check this restaurant off my list."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok. The mouska was tasty and eggplant cooked well, not over cooked."}
{"text":"Just because you name your restaurant after a hit movie (as for the movie-meh, I've experienced better) doesn't mean you can phone it in. On 3 different occasions, the service was indifferent to entirely missing, the food was uninspired, and on the last occasion, we had to send our food back THREE TIMES before they got it right (or at least how it is supposed to be according to the menu). 

Three strikes and you are out-I can't recommend this place.

There are waaay better places on Mill Ave (Crave leaps to mind)-even if you have to pay more (and that's a pretty tough trick, as this place isn't wallet friendly either). The Greek Pita at Tempe Marketplace makes this place an embarrassment. TRY HARDER!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner tonight, my waitress had a very bad attitude. I ordered the Falafal dinner pita, these were the worst falafals I have ever had. They were dry, bitter, and crunchy... not in the good way.
 My waitress kept disappearing during the dinner, so water was very limited. When it was time for my birthday 'chocolate torte' it was basically just thrown on the table in front of me and the waitress just walked away. The torte was bad too, it tasted similar to dirt. But it was free so I can't complain too much. 

I really used to like this place when it actually looked like a Greek place rather than some stupid bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!!!  They have the best hummus and pita bread.  If you are short on a money I would recommend going at lunch and getting one of the lunch specials because they are still big portions, delicious and less hurt on the wallet."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions in the past and always seemed to be pretty good, nothing spectacular but good.  My favorite was the baklava cheesecake.  Although last night I ate there and the service and food were awful! Our waitress, Edna gave us our drinks then came back 10 minutes later to take our order. After waiting for over 30min for our food she brought our food out and then completely ignored us for refills or to make sure we didn't need anything, or to ask if the food was ok. Finally, I ended up walking back to the kitchen to have someone send her to our table. 
Another 10min went by, she finally comes to the table, looks at our empty glasses and asks if we needed refills? (Too bad we were already done with our very dry pizza!) 
I asked if we could have a piece of the baklava cheesecake, hoping maybe that would at least be a highlight....but I was wrong! It tasted freezer burned, and it was just disgusting! 
When Edna brought our refills back (in mini glasses that you would get a drink in the bar with), she asked how the cheesecake was and I told her it was bad.  She gives me a line of bull telling me they had a new cook and must still be trying to perfect the recipe...!
I know for a fact they don't even make it there they order the cheesecake from someone else! 
Edna's way of \"making up\" for the horrible service and awful food was a $5.00 off coupon I could use on my next visit! Needless to say....I left her $5 coupon on the table as her tip! I don't know if they changed owners of management or what, but what ever it is they are failing horribly!! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is worth your time and the garlic hummus is mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"Nothing terrible, but nothing great.  Kind of blah.  We also ordered roasted garlic hummus but pretty sure we got jalapeño cilantro instead.  No biggie but definitely a shock to my 1 year olds palate when he bit in.  I've been spoiled with truly great Greek food in the likes of niko niko's in Houston Texas where I used to live and so far phoenix doesn't even come close with its Greek offerinngs.  Disappointing.  Would kill for a real good gyro."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive. We have been there twice now and they remembered us from the first time. Very helpful when giving recommendations. 

The food was better than average and the portions are good.

The price point is low but the product quality is high, which makes this a great place.

The only reason it hasn't received 5 stars from me is that I haven't dined there enough to see if the price and product quality stay consistent. 

Put it this way, I would take my friends and family to this place!"}
{"text":"one of the first places i've tried in arizona during my brief stint. i haven't really tried greek food much since i find it too healthy. i had the chicken souvlaki, greek salad and ice tea. the chicken souvlaki was good but not greak, but their greek salad was awesome. i ended up finishing the salad and taking the rest of the chicken to go. man, i miss that salad. hope they open one in southern california."}
{"text":"It's been about two years since we went to MBFG in Old Town. After we were seated and already ordered the Saganaki, I realized why we hadn't been in such a long time . . . the place is a d-u-m-p!  The only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a Greek restaurant is the startling cry of \"Opa!\" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.  

Once I got past that, I was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  Apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only Greek varieties available. Greek wine? Would it taste like ouzo? The water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.

Saganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!

I have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  The Old Town location is like eating in a cave.  If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . ."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner the other night for something different.... Got promptly seated inside and felt like the a/c was on. took almost 10 minutes to be greeted by a server, we asked to be moved to a different section, alittle warmer spot. Boarder-line ignorant response as we chose another table. I guess he was pissed because we were now out of his section because it seemed like everyone was asking out of that section... after another 10 minutes our server took drink orders quickly and disappeared! At this point all I wanted to do was order some food! Finally, we order. The food is plentiful and our server Chris turned out to be a very knowledgable individual with good reccomendations AND alot of tables.... Once the order was in the food started coming out at a nice pace. I will say everything should have been hotter. The kitchen is by the door and it was probably 50 last night. They is a constant slight breeze because of the outside seating and the doorway is open from the outside to the dining room. Lot of food on your plate, you wont be hungry when you leave but like I said, needs to be hotter.."}
{"text":"Service was decent. The manager was even extra attentive to the customers. We went on Wednesday evening so it wasn't too packed.  They were kind enough to give us $10 off our next meal. 

The food was so-so. It wasn't horrible and it wasn't the best Greek food I've ever had. Everything was reasonably priced. Kids eat free everyday for every adult meal purchased after 4 PM, which is great since I have 3 kids. Their $6 signature cocktails were really good!  Definitely try a few on their list. It was a good balance of flavor and alcohol. Overall, our tab wasn't too bad for a family of 5. 

One thing I noticed was the not-so cleanliness of the place. Maybe I'm just being super anal bc I'm a germaphobe, but the seats were stained and the windows look like they haven't been cleaned in ages. I recommend maybe renovating a few areas of the restaurant, if at all possible."}
{"text":"Walking down Mill Ave one can see many signs and lunch specials calling your name. A friend and I wanting lunch between classes, we hopped off the orbit and came upon MBFGR and its awsome $5 pita lunch special and chose to give it a try.

I had the Gyro pita lunch that came with a salad or fries. My friend had the Grilled Chicken Pita, we both loved our lunches. the servers didn't mind us sitting around for over an hour gossiping and laughing around about God knows what. They kept our sodas topped off and our food was great! The salad could use another kalamata olive and my gyro was so stuffed I wished I had a second pita! It was so yummy, we were in love and I will TOTALLY be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I do not know what happened to this place. 
I used to eat here all the time, but its obvious that something has changed.
My wife and I went here on Sunday for a late lunch (2pm). We were seated quickly, and the waitress came over promptly, took our order and then vanished. We ordered an appetizer of dolmades, with entree of hummus + grilled chicken and a gyro +steamed vegetables. 

25 minutes later our dolmades arrive at our table, then another 15 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Did I mention I ordered a gyro? The wait was crazy considering there were no more than 10 tables with patrons. The only saving grace was that Yelp had a online coupon for $10.00 off if we spent $25.00 or more. No one apologized for the long wait time in the kitchen. 

The food was as good as expected, but its kinda hard to screw up a gyro and hummus. I would go back but not unless I had plenty of time to eat."}
{"text":"First time I've been here since it changed names. It is no longer My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, it's now called Pita Kouzina. I used to love going here, the prices were good, and my husband loved the calamari salad they had. Our last visit, first thing he noticed - calamari salad was removed from the menu, the prices have gone up a little bit. I order a gyro pita, there was an overwhelming amount of tomato spewing out of it, and very little gyro. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"First I have to say I am greek and I have been to Greece a few time's. Then also to add I am a chef. Well came in for drinks and to go online and talk to friends back home. The staff here were so nice . Had the pita and hummus as a snack. Well after such a fun night drinking just had to come back with the family for lunch. We started with a mixed Appetizer plate that was very good. The Dolmades was just like my mom made them , ok bit better. I had the lamb chop's and they were cooked on the rare side just like they should. I do not even need to say how great the roasted potatoes were. The staff for lunch GREAT. The boy that waited on us with the same last name as the owne,r but he said he is not family was great. The bartenders here aslo sweet and nice. Came back tonight for drinks again and more food."}
{"text":"I have worked in the food industry for years now and service is very important to me. The food is what brings the customer in, but the service can make or break the whole journey no matter how good the food is in my opinion. The food here is not all that great either. My girlfriend and I went here about a year ago, we were on a lets try some new places kick, I had heard good things so we gave it a go. It was a random weekday night, the place was half packed and we got seated right away. Great start but then all down hill... We sat at our table for about 8 mins talking and looking at the menu, no service yet which we thought was wierd, so after another 5 mins we asked a server walking by if we could get a couple of waters, she said sure. Now at this point we were thinking okay our server will be back with waters and we can order or ask questions, nope guess again... The women dropped off the waters with a smile and here ya go, then left? Now another 8 minutes later were thinking lets just go, this is ridiculous, but sure enough someone finally came over. Wow that only took over 20 mins, jeez. After some questions were answered about some dishes we ordered, an app and two meals to split and try. The app took about 15 mins to get to the table and we just got some kind of hummus? Our waters were empty when it hit the table because of course we didn't see our waitress since we ordered. The main dishes, which I don't even remember what they were, except gross, took another 20 mins. I've never been to a place where they have snails severing you, I mean they were not busy, but yet loved to talk to each other, while we just waited and waited. I remember leaving here about an hour and half after walking in the door, and we weren't drinking, hanging out, or ordering dessert? Crazy! The best thing we had was the hummus and it was not great, just average. We will never be back, and I think even if everything tasted amazing we still would never be back."}
{"text":"Good quality Greek-American food.  Nice helpful staff.  Clean and pleasant atmosphere.  I have gone several times and have been pleased each time."}
{"text":"Overall this place is a solid three stars; however, the patio definitely brings it up a notch.  This patio overlooks Mill ave and is a great place to get a free \"show\" during your meal.  While it is true in AZ that patio weather is only for a couple months out of the year, this is one of the patios during these months I will be sure to hit up.  Grab a bunch of friends, a couple of cocktails and sit back and enjoy the show.  On the day we were there we were witness to one of the most unorganized protest marches I have ever seen, and a whole variety of drunk people on random tangents. 

The food here is pretty decent, moderately priced as well.  Our server was a little absent, but I think he was just over-extended.  The manager was very nice, if not a little too overly flirtatious. On this visit I had some Greek beer that was fabulous (hmmm.. that reminds me, I keep forgetting to look for it at Total)  and a pomegranate mojito.. a lil pricey for the size, but tasty nonetheless. 

Overall, I'd recommend it.  Definitely for patio goodness, and moderately for the food."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice.  It is obviously a favorite of the locals.  
Service was excellent.  I should not that my wife has food allergies.  We have eaten at a lot of Greek Restaurants and never had to trouble with asking for special preparation.  Simply stated real Greek cooking does not have a lot of nightshade in it.  Well . . .we order food that you would not normally find any being served with nightshade.  When the waitress brought it out it was covered in paprika.  Much to our surprise when we mentioned this to the waitress, she immediately took the plate back to the kitchen and got all new food for us.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  We were impressed.

The food is good, but a little lacking in flavor.  Not a lot mind you just a little.  The portions are about right, maybe a little too much, but that is better than too little.

The staff if friendly and the service was very quick even though the place was packed.  I strongly recommend for lunch or dinner.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"went there tonight. Busy place but not full.
Went with some friends and ordered our mains - took 50+mins to get. They got my order wrong and said that they would try to get it out to me as quickly as possible but waiting another hour wasn't a good option.
The meals looked pretty good, though were reported to be dry and a little tasteless.
The poor service has definitely left a bad taste ( since I didn't get to eat anything except to drink a plastic glass of water). I would offer that they could have offered a faster meal, gratis, rather than offering the same meal which would have taken upwards of 30 mins to assemble. But that didn't happen.
Would not suggest it for kids only due to the long wait for service and the meals"}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOO TOTALLY WORTH IT !!!! the food is FANTASTIC !!! GREAT Value for the money - Excellent Service !!!! We were literally HEART BROKEN when the Superstition Springs location closed - so to see that they are alive and well in Tempe is a GREAT FEELING - We'll be there at least twice a month from now on !!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here twice and were very happy with the food, service and ambiance.
The salads are generous, crisp, tasty. The vegetarian mousaka was excellent. They use a very good quality feta cheese. I loved the grilled shrimp ."}
{"text":"Best greek food in the east valley. The service is always great and the food is always good. The portions are HUGE for the price. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"I  decided to check this place out since it's conveniently located in the AZ center. I ordered the fish tacos lunch special. I must say that I was not pleased with my meal for the hefty price of $11. The tacos simply had tilapia pieces and were somewhat dry in flavor. There was some type of sauce but the taste of the tacos was sorely lacking. In fact, the rice and beans dappered with feta cheese were a much better option in my estimation. Even worse, the wait to receive a take out lunch order or rice, beans and these fish tacos took about 35 minutes. Based on the meal I received, the wait seemed to be a bit excessive so the service was lacking in the regard. Since I ordered the food to go, I could have sat down and the wait would have been approximately the same.

 Normally, I've had very positive experiences with this restaurant at its various locations, but today I was unfortunately disappointed. I hope in the future this could improve for future customers.

{"text":"With all that hype about this restaurant, I was excited about going there. But hmm it was just... how can I put it? Meh! Didn't do it for me. I would rather go to Daphne's."}
{"text":"Very, very bad food.
Had tried this location several years ago and found the food to be bland.
Fast forward to Wednesday, December 11th, 2013 and my crazy idea to give MBFGR another chance.
It was a grievous mistake - Gyro had not taste.  Fries were harder then cardboard.  Even my 18 month old son who LOVES fries, spit them out.  As this was take out, the three types of Hummus were give to us in clear, plastic cups (picture smoothie cups).  Not kidding!
And as the other reviewer stated, this location gets no business and I am shocked to see it still open.
Moving forward, I will give other small businesses my $ and never again to these guys."}
{"text":"The calzones are fantastic. It's fun to grab dinner and then a movie at the amc. Now that parking downtown is free after 5 it makes it even more convenient!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy all types of food...this of course includes Greek. It's hard to find really good Greek food with decent prices though...that's why I really like My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. They have a great menu with lots of choices, great portion sizes, and very decent prices as opposed to going to a fast-food feel Greek restaurant for the same price. If you don't get Greek often or are taking someone out you should get the Flaming Saganaki. It's Greek cheese flamed with ouzo at your table and everyone gets to scream Opa! So much fun! It comes with pita slices. Yummy...the flame will make you smell weird though...FYI in case you're planning on going out afterwards. I'm picky about tzatziki sauce but I love the one from here. Their Greek fries are sooooo finger-licking good...they should seriously be illegal. Haha. Yum! Fries covered in feta cheese, parmesan cheese, lemon Dijon sauce, and oregano. I know, healthy and delicious. ;-) I love the Gyro meat here too. I always used to get it. Now that I don't eat meat I get a vegetarian pita sandwich...I change it up though because they have a lunch special menu with a huge selection of pitas. I always get the Greek fries with it."}
{"text":"my friend and i went to this place and they couldn't even get a simple burger made right. i mean really how hard is it to make a well don e burger. they had made it twice and both times it was pink in the middle."}
{"text":"Under new ownership ... The already awesome gyros taste better than ever and so does the baklava! One of my favorite restaurants and I can walk to it!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was too late (9 pm?...haah), or if those in the kitchen were cooking with drowsy palates...

ANYWAY, after driving around with indecisive passengers the other night, we all finally agreed on this place. Initially excited... we were not so much enthralled by dinner's end. 

I got the Award Winning Gyro Dinner. Personal opinion of this- not very award winning, and did not even intrigue my eyes. Beef and lamb were dehydrated and vegetables originated from a freezer bag. Was given scarce pieces of pita (should have just brought my own bag of pita chips since this was the case), and the tzatziki was not the distinct  blend of yoghurt accompaniment... it was ranch dressing. 

The gyro dinner is a far cry from award winning, dishonorable mention to say the least. I suppose my dish and I disliked each other so much that my doggy bag committed suicide atop my car, and became mere slop on the pavement."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been to this location here in Tempe. The hardest thing was finding a place to park! Other than that it was great. 
We got the appetizer with all the tastes of Greece. Grape leaves were wonderful, as well as the Hummus. Lots of bread was served with everything. Pita Bread and a type of bread in small slices, which was very good and fresh.
So wonderful and delish was the Flaming Cheese! That was amazing!
I got the lamb and awesome... I would get it again.
We did get the Baklava cake, not my favorite. Real Baklava is much better.  
Service was very fast and friendly. Restrooms were clean. 
I would go back here any time."}
{"text":"Came here looking for greek food..  the food was ok..  i had the saganaki to start, and it was ok, it didnt seem like traditional greek cheese.  It wasnt brown on both sides. They need to dip it in flour first, then pre bake it then flambe it.  

Then i had the tyrokafteri..  it didnt have enough feta and oil. It was kind of watery and too red

Then had th gyro for dinner...  it was good but you cant mess up gyro"}
{"text":"Well it's not all Greek to me...

I have been to this restaurant twice. This place has great staff, good environment and reasonable prices. The food is good but just not great. It does not quite have the authentic home town feel authentic Greek food can have. The food feels slightly \"canned\". It's good- but feels more like a great Olive Garden as apposed to an authentic cuisine. The first time I was here it was not a great experience. The second time I enjoyed but was not blown away."}
{"text":"The saganaki was amazing as always.  The service was very rushed.  I ordered soup-yum!  My entree was the petit filet w steamed veggies. I think they forgot to season the meat at all...and the veggies were under cooked. The potatos were very lemony, but I like them like that.  Mom ordered beef and chicken souvlaki, all her meat was overcooked.  Small mom and pop Greek restaurants always out perform here.

I've been here before and have had similar experiences with the beef.  My friends ordered the bone-in lamb and had them bring out two more plates it was so delicious.  Overall, I'd say stick with the GREEK food here, don't go for the steak or chicken.

Also, restaurant.com always has the $2 coupons that are worth $25, or $50."}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit that I'm a tad biased because I can get actual authentic Greek food at home. I do like to try other Greek places to see how they compare. This place is just ok. I stopped in with a couple of friends because we found a great deal on restaurants.com. I had their gyros and avgolemono (chicken & lemon) soup. It all seemed a bit bland to me. If you're looking for mediocre Greek-ish food, this is it. I probably won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This was not a Greek restaurant and this is a restaurant that serves iceberg lettuce with tomatoes uncleaned with the eyes still in the tomato serve to you with one olive. Served with I don't know what type of dressing but it's not Greek they had no lemons, their pita bread was absolutely horrible and the chicken had no flavor this is not a Greek restaurant this is a bunch of people taking your money for a bunch of crappy food. Someone we went with never ate Greek and I said you still have not eaten Greek food yet because this is not Greek food. The service was subpar and the linens was dirty I would never go back to this restaurant I a tourist from Florida thanks Attending a local convention."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I ever had. Outside sitting is great for people watching. Our server Logan was very genuine and friendly. He is very hospitable and knows the menu very well."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a co-worker.  The food was very good and the service was great.  Was with a group of friends when I came here a few months back.   The brushetta was to die for and the stuffed grape leaves were delicious.  We had the gyro platter which consisted of beef and lamb carved off the shank and Mousaka which was an egg plant and potato dish that melted in your mouth!  It is a lively place and they had a nice bar.  The waiters were wonderful too.  You'll like this place so check it out."}
{"text":"Well, I'm glad I didn't read the review below before going here, or I'd have just starved--or eaten Hooter's! I have a little food poisoning problem, you see (as in, I hate it, and get it too often). I also don't like chains, but made an exception for this regional one.

Actually, I was really grateful to find this place. It was Easter, everything in downtown was closed (and I called around to a half-dozen places), and I was starving. The meals here were insanely huge (like 2 or 3 meals in one--plenty of leftovers) and the \"glasses\" of wine were generous, too (they're mini carafes). We ordered the red pepper feta dip for an appetizer--delicious. I got the gyro meat special and the meat was incredibly tasty. The BF ordered the moussaka, and his was good, too. Nobody got sick. 

Sitting on the patio with the waterfalls and scenery of the Arizona Center was good stuff after a long day of traveling for the both of us."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Colo Spgs and had been to the Big Fat Greek there many times, it was one of our favorites. We always ordered the Big meat platter. We were disappointed when we came here and the items were different than what we were used to and also the portion size was also smaller. They hook you up In Colo Spgs, CO location, It was good, just not what were used to from our past experiences at MY BIG FAT GREEK. Service was good, restaurant was nice and clean. We may return for items that cant be found at a normal greek cafe, but found another yummy place if you want a juicy delicious gyro sandwich, Phoenicia is delicious!!"}
{"text":"On one of our trips to Phoenix, my husband and I were looking for a nice place to eat  close to our hotel and saw this place.  We were not disappointed.  The food was very good and this place definitely lives up to its name when it comes to the portions.  It was definitely big and fat!!"}
{"text":"Humus is so simple to prepare, how do you mess this up so tragically????  What was it?  30 cloves of garlic, no salt and bean paste?  I took ONE bite.  Yep, twelve hours later and I'm still and I mean STILL burping that abomination.  The \"lamb\" flatbread wrap, or whatever in the name of god you people are calling this thing, was nothing more than under seasoned, cheap pork.  And I got a side of French fries that were prepared sometime last Monday.  Really?  French Fries?  Holy God."}
{"text":"My first visit at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was mostly a pleasant one.

For starters my fiance and I both loved the appetizers. The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, because personally I love the soft bread they use. I don't like the crunchy hard bruschetta bread that other places use. Here the bread is soft and delicious. We also had the calamari and were pleased with it.

We ordered the gyro platter and were mostly happy with it, but we didn't like that they hardly give you any pieces of pita bread. We didn't mention it, but the waitress ended up asking if we wanted more pita bread anyways. We said yes and ended up getting charged an extra dollar, which I wish they would have mentioned because I assumed when she asked that it was complimentary to go along with the dish.

Aside from that the service was pretty good. They served refills in pitchers which was interesting. The only food item I didn't like was the potatoes which came as a side to the gyro platter. They had a weird taste. We both enjoyed the desserts here though. The bill was also a bit more than what we had expected, but on the whole we were pleased with this restaurant mainly because of the excellent appetizers!"}
{"text":"We love MBFGR, and have eaten there many times.  We took friends to this location on a Saturday night, and the result was disastrous.

 First off, we were seated within 10 minutes, but had to wait 10 more before someone came to the table for drink orders.  By this time, we were hungry, so when a waitress came by to take our drink orders for her partner, we gave her our food order, too.

Our drinks (water only) came about 10 minutes later.  About 10 minutes after that, our waitress came by to inform us that they were out of potatoes, and what did we want to do?  What?  How can a restaurant be out of their main side dish?  She subbed in fries for lack of any other options.  We waited another 30 minutes after that (without seeing our waitress once) before our food arrived.

I ordered lamb souvlaki, medium, which was terribly overcooked.  The steamed vegetables were mush.  My friend actually sent her veggies back, because hers were so mushy.  The fries were soggy and gross.  They sent out no pita bread, and we had to ask for it.

After we finished our meal, we realized we'd been there about 90 minutes, and had to go pick up our kids.  We flagged down another waiter and asked for the check quickly.  10 minutes later, nothing.  We flagged down a different waitress and asked once again for the check.  Nothing.  Five minutes later, my husband walks back to the bar area and all the wait staff is standing around, watching TV and laughing.  Seriously?  He firmly asks for the check, and someone was out (not our waitress) within twos minutes.  It then took another 10 to process our payment, and at that time (tip time) our waitress FINALLY came out to apologize profusely and ask how the food was.  I will seriously NEVER eat there again.  EVER."}
{"text":"Oh dear. I'm going to leave my review at 2 stars because I have had a decent time here, but you guys have GOT to hear this:

Some co-workers and I stopped into My Big Fat Greek Restaurant for a quick lunch last Saturday (we were working at the Herberger Festival of the Arts). It also happened to be Jami's birthday, which made the ridiculousness of our meal that much more memorable.

OK, we arrive and are seated around 12:30ish. The waitress asks, \"Would you like to order drinks?\" We reply yes, as we are hot and tired and ready for big glasses of water. She gives us the alcoholic drink menu. 

\"Oh, no ... sorry!\" we say, \"we want water, please.\" 

Jami orders an iced tea, and then I say, \"Do you have Coca-Cola?\" 

She says, \"Yes, you want a Coke?\" 

\"Yes, please. But I want water also.\"

\"So, half and half?\"

\"Yes. No! Wait - I would like one glass of water and one separate glass of Coke.\" 

Did that just happen?

Our drinks arrive, and my Coke does not taste right. We don't think it's diet, but something just isn't right. We flag down another waitress and tell her about the funky Coke. I ask, \"Can you maybe taste the regular Coke to see if it's something with the machine?\" 

She says, \"I don't really know the difference, so I don't know how much help I'll be, but I'll get you another.\"

She returns with a fresh Coke, and I take a sip. The table erupts with laughter based on my facial expression. It is not good. She says, \"Yeah, I tasted it and it didn't taste right.\" 

So she brought it to me anyway?

She starts to leave, and I say, \"Um, can I get something else - a Mr. Pibb?\" 

\"You want something else?\"

\"Well, I want SOMETHING.\"

The new drink arrives, and it's fine. Whew.

We order our lunch, and there is some confusion over whether or not Jami and I are sharing because we happen to be ordering the same dish. I have to explain, \"I would like my own personal order of the falafel pita.\" Lillian orders a calzone.She's excited for something gooey and cheesy. When she orders, Lil actually points to the item she is ordering. \"I\"ll have the Mediterranean calzone, but without pepperoni.\" 

Our food arrives, and the waitress is carrying a pizza. Uh oh. 

\"Oh, I, um, wanted a calzone.\"

The waitress stares. \"This is what you ordered, see?\" and she holds up her notepad. \"No pepperoni.\"

\"No .... I ordered a calzone, not a pizza.\"

\"It's the same thing,\" she says. \"Just fold it over.\"

Jami and I individually examine our falafel. There is no tzatziki  sauce, and we flag down another waitress who immediately gets it for us.  Now, I've had the falafel here, and it's been good before, but on this particular day it was as hard as a rock. Really. It was nearly impossible to stab it with a fork. I ate my fries. Jami started pounding one of her falafel disks on her plate, and it sounded like the falafel was ceramic. 

The waitress came over to ask us if everything was ok, and I said, \"Actually, the falafel is really overcooked. You might want to tell the kitchen. I've had it here before, and this is really inedible.\" 

\"Do you want something else?\" 

\"No, thanks\" I was filling up on fries and eating the pita. Really healthy, I know.

She left and then returned and said, \"I asked and they said you have to crumble it in your hands.\" 

We almost burst out laughing.

We chatted about how crazy it was that it was Jami's birthday and we were having this ridiculously bad lunch. 

The waitress came back to ask us how things were, and Jami said, \"Fabulous!\" We were hysterical. 

At least now we have a fun story, and a new office catch-phrase. When something's not quite right, we'll say, \"Just fold it over.\""}
{"text":"Hands down the most bland food I've ever had.   Greek Meatballs were room temp, all drinks were accompanied by a sticky glass, and the side salad was basically an onion or two.  The Grilled Chicken Wrap contained overcooked chicken, more balsamic vinegar than I've ever seen and the tiniest sprinkling of feta.  All other parties at the table were disappointed as well.  They had also described the food as bland and we we all felt like we were in the twilight zone with the bizarre  music that was playing.  The manager took $10 off the bill, but that hardly made up for it."}
{"text":"I was craving hummus for lunch. I was shopping at the mall and wanted something close...Big Fat it is. 
We sat down and ordered our water and tea. My dining partner wanted to see a wine list, so the waitress brought it over. Then she decided not to return for 15-20 min! We asked to taste two different wines, the waitress brought them over and my friend decided on one. Well, the waitress then took away the tasting glass, still half-full?! This chick was in a zone. We ordered the chicken soulvaki and the hummus trio. The hummus was really bad. It was gritty and flavorless. The chicken was so dry that my friend actually chocked on it!!! 
While trying to swallow our lunch we noticed that the bus boy would leave the side dishes on tables if they looked clean, for the next guests to eat off of, eeewww!! 
There we no towels in the bathroom when we got there, so I told the waitress. I went back to the bathroom about an hour later and still no towels?? I told the \"manager\" who was just as useless. 
My iced tea sat empty for quite awhile until I flagged down our space-cadet waitress. 
I used to come here and sit on the patio with my dog....never again..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Service food and overall quality
Will not keep me coming back. Server told our daughter that the muscles and pasta always gets complaints and so she was not surprised when we returned it. Manager left early so nobody to talk with. 
Service was not accurate.  Took two trys to get a Greek salad correct.  Hopefully place will do some improvements to keep getting and maintain customers."}
{"text":"Ended up here again on another trip to Scottsdale. Pretty much was the same as I remembered it from a year ago. I was with coworkers this time and we got to try a few different things though:

-Fire roasted feta was pretty good and surprisingly spicy (normally its not  in other places)
- Tzatziki was good but not amazing. Redeeming factor= tons of pita bread came with both feta and this dish.
- I got some sort of modified gyros wrap that was wrapped in a rosemary seasoned tortilla instead of the usual pita. This dish was tasty and had a TON of gyro meat in it. Unfortunately the gyro meat was the same as I remembered it last time -- good but not the best I've ever had. This wrap was huge; I was starving and could barely eat half of it. 
- I also tried a Greek beer but I don't remember the name...it was good though. Yeah I know, that was a pretty useless statement cause it won't help you when you go to order, but I felt I had to at least throw it out there. 

Overall, I'd go back if work brought me to Scottsdale again but I probably wouldn't go on my own dime."}
{"text":"I have gone to that Big Fat Greek in Chandler mall a few times; and the food was good - ambiance was ok but it is totally different from the location in Mesa.

My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night, we had a restaurant.com certificate; figured we would give it a try. The service was exceptional, we ordered the meat lovers platter as well as the trio appetizers ( 2 types of hummus and baba ghonoush). The food was really good - a lot so we definitely had a lot to take home. 

At the top of the hour the entire wait staff got together and all danced around the restaurant to a traditional Greek song - we really enjoyed seeing that as well as how engaging the staff was. From the sagi noki (flaming cheese) and the dancing - felt like you were part of the family and really enjoyed the ambiance.

The reason why it is 4 stars; most of the wines on their menu were not available but other than that this would be a perfect place to entertain family, friends or out of town guests."}
{"text":"My friend got the gyro pita with a Greek salad and I got the falafel pita also with a Greek salad for lunch.The falafel had a little kick to it from the spices, but the salad was a little small. That being said, it was good but we both agreed that we've had better Greek food before."}
{"text":"We opted for a Saturday night dinner and a movie at the Arizona Center and decided to visit My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.

It was remarkably uncrowded for 7pm on a Saturday (Why is it that no one goes to the Arizona Center?).  We were seated right away.  We skipped the patio because, um, it's June in Arizona, and were taken to a 1/2 table 1/2 both towards the back.  

We cracked up at the drinks.  Maybe they are generous, or maybe they get tired of refilling, but the glasses were at least 32 ounce.  This was good, but not what we'd expect from this type of restaurant. 

I'm going to say that the food was good but not terrific.  It should be noted that I wouldn't even know what Greek food is and I ordered the Italian Chicken Parm because when it comes to food, I live on the whatever-is-opposite-of-wild side.

The server was personable and prompt.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time...so truly no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Great lunch prices.  Love the flaming saganaki!  And the flaming Baklava makes me cry with delight every time.  Go here...it is great to impress visitors.  : )  Make sure to sit back from the flame.  I have seen it burn one or two before."}
{"text":"Ok americanized greek food, good for groups. Pita Jungle would be a better choice. If you're looking for a more authentic kabob place, try Haji Baba. 

Baklava cheesecake wasn't as amazing as I had hoped."}
{"text":"You know what? I really used to like this place but the last time I went here the host refused to seat us. He said we had to wait 10 mins despite the fact that his restaurant was completely empty. When I asked him why he wouldn't seat us he said he had reservations coming in in 15 mins. Well if your reservations aren't coming in for another 15 mins, why make us wait 10 mins? It doesn't make sense. And I'm sorry people, but there was NOBODY in the restaurant. The bartender actually started to seat us until the host finally showed up from his break and told her not to seat us. The main problem I have is that the host guy was really rude. I told him I would never set foot in his restaurant again and he got all pissed and stormed off like my five year old. Anyway, screw this place and their rude host."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, especially since I heard so-so reviews from several people. We choose this place last minute, but I'm thankful we did. We ordered the hummus for appetizers, which was good, and the pita bread was fantastic, worth the 50 cents they charge you for extra. I got the pork souvlaki, and the pork was perfect, I would come here again just for the pork. The servings are huge, so you could definitely share. The service was pretty good, a little unenthusiastic, but I guess saying Opa a hundred times a day gets a little old. But I don't work there so, OPA!"}
{"text":"The Greek Salad, is definitely something to talk about! The dressing on the salad is superb, with the perfect mix of feta, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. 

The portion sizes are very large. The Gyro sandwhich is delicious, and I tend to get that often. I LOVE how the pita is sooo soft.  My coworkers always tend to get the Aegean Club, which has gyro meat, chicken, and bacon sandwhiched between two pieces of pita bread, with a side of Greek salad. 

The appetizers are nothing to talk about., save room for your entree. I've been to Greece and the dolmas are a miss. The feta is a miss. The hummus is pretty good but, as I learned in Greece, its not Greek. The flaming feta is great, but it's not real Greek. Lighting cheese on fire, a sight worth seeing if you haven't seen before. 

Also I highly reccomend sitting outside to enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather, and seeing the lights border the palm trees! This makes for a perfect relaxing backdrop after a long day at work! 

This place is a definate go to if you're in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Went there today and doors are locked.  Are they closed?  No sign or anything. So sad. Loved this place and went there all of the time ......."}
{"text":"We've been here many times over the years and it is always great tasting food with great service.  You have to get the flaming cheese!"}
{"text":"I brought my young son here and had a great dinner.  I usually order a  chicken pita at the Shea location, but I asked the waitress for another idea and so I ordered what she suggested.  It was something I never would have tried on my own, and it was fantastic.  I really enjoyed my meal here and appreciated the super friendly staff.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for a couple of cocktails with a girlfriend around 4:15pm.  We sat outside on the patio.  There were MAYBE five occupied tables in the whole restaurant including ours, and probably 5 staff members setting up for the evening shift.  

We got our first drink at around 4:20pm, didn't even get checked on until at least 25 minutes later.  The server that was obviously assigned to our table knew we were there?!   He had no problem chit-chatting with us when we first came in at our table.  

During that 25 minute wait, a lady walked by and we literally said excuse me, Excuse me ma'am, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.  There's no way she didn't hear us.  She totally ignored us.  I finally went inside and kindly asked the lady pulling down the sun shades to send our server outside.  10 MINUTES LATER, he comes out.  

Long story short, we leave.  They knew we were upset.  

We were so disappointed!  HORRIBLE SERVICE!  Sir, the fact that you were 'changing your shift' is not an excuse.  You were there when we got there and you're still here!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. We were so excited to find an authentic Greek restaurant in the area.  We've been back a few times, and told our friends about it.....

....then, everything changed.  A few nights ago, we went to order take-out.  Everything seemed the same, the google listing still said \"My Big Fat Greek\", the website still listed the location, and I could swear the girl that answered the phone said \"My Big Fat Greek\" - maybe I was just daydreaming about delicious food I was about to have....

...then, my dreams were shattered cold.  I drove up to notice something amiss.  What's this?  Where's half the normal sign that I pass by almost daily?  Where's the bright colors?  Where's the crowds?  Where's the old man playing that Greek guitar-like instrument on stage?

Sadly, this place has changed.  It's now \"My Greek Restaurant\".  According the the waitress behind the counter, there are new owners.  But, \"the food is still the same\". I was hopeful.  I got my order, which seemed more expensive than usual.  When I asked for a take out menu I was told \"oh, we don't have those yet, they're still working on them\".

I got home and wanted to cry.  This was NOT the same food that we've grown to love there.  The gyro meet was missing something; something that the odd green spice flakes sprinkled on couldn't mask.  The pork souvlaki was so salty, that it was hard to eat.  The rice was bland, missing flavor, and again salty, from what I suspect was the cheap chicken broth it was cooked in.  The vegetables - well, I still can't understand the veggies and what role they played there.  The tzatzki was good, but I suspect it was from a jar and not homemade.  The Baklava, which I thought would at least be a saving grace, was practically inedible.  

I mourn the loss of what used to be.  I don't know why this restaurant changed hands or owners, or what, but it is definitely \"not the same\".  I'm sitting in proverbial corner, rocking myself to sleep until I can find a suitable substitution for what once was. (Well, I wouldn't go that far, but needless to say, i won't be returning to this location anytime in the future.). 

Moral of this story:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Large place with tons of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor patio area opens up to the shopping plaza with water fountains, trees, and birds ever-present. Quite the ambiance for a nice meal with friends or colleagues. 

What do birds, water, and trees all sound like together? Well listen below and you'll know.

[tweet tweet, rush, & sway]

I ordered the Gyros Platter (see photo) and it was very good. Meat was excellent and not too salty. I'm picky about my meat not being salty and braced myself when the plate arrived. It did not disappoint. 

Friendly, upbeat servers and a nice atmosphere. If I lived local, I'd be back. Will have to catch it again on my next visit."}
{"text":"I've given this place a try several times, but I just can't seem to get a good meal out of there. I had their alfredo pasta and it had absolutely no flavor at all. It just lacks flavor, everything I order I feel like going back into the kitchen to add a little seasoning. There are plenty little Greek places around that serves up good home made food and for alot less $$ too, I wouldn't bother with this place again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. I am a fan of Greek food and very much enjoy the dolmades and chicken gyros. I did not give this restaurant 5 stars because the food does lack slightly in flavor in my opinion. Overall, the service and the food has been good. I have been coming to this location since they opened and stop in one to three times a year for my Greek fix! I recommend Omega Gyros too in Mesa."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere outside on patio with fountains. Service can be slow at times. Souvlaki was not best as eggplant undercooked. Gyro plate was GREAT! And hummus and flaming cheese was tasty."}
{"text":"My partner and I were enjoying the day riding the light rail aimlessly. We were pretty hungry as we hadn't eaten since lunch the previous day. We decided to ride the train to Tempe and visit My Big Fat Greek on Mill Ave. We had the Grecian Delight pizza as an appetizer and a Gyro platter for entree, which we split between us. Everything was perfect from the service to the food. Ryan the owner,  even welcomed us back from our previous visit 2 months prior. While the food is definitely Not authentic Greek, it is a wonderful Americanized version of it. Before I forget, you have got to try the baklava cheesecake."}
{"text":"On my first visit to Phoenix, this restaurant was across from my hotel.  At first I was skeptical: would Greek food in the southwest be any good? Then I told myself I was being unfair to Phoenix and decided to give it a try.  I should have listened to my gut. 

For a restaurant with \"Greek\" in the title, I'm amazed at just how bad the \"Greek\" food was.  I tried both the moussaka and the pastitsio, and both were completely underwhelming.  First of all, both were topped with Italian-style tomato sauce and Parmesan.  No sign of the bechamel that is supposed to be atop the pastitsio (even says it on the menu!).  The \"macaroni\" filling was actually giant pieces of penne, and there was no hint of Greek spice anywhere.  The moussaka was even worse: same Italian sauce and cheese on top, but filled with what appeared to be peelings from zucchini and eggplant, all rather al dente.  I sent it back.  The pita wedges and the hummus on the appetizer plate were very good and the best thing I ate.  

Service and management were both quite good; they kept my water filled and offered to bring me something else for free when it became clear I wasn't happy with my food.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"After arriving in Scottsdale from our 5 hour drive from San Diego, my friend and I were starved! We decided on Greek and decoded on this place as neither one of us had frequented this chain before. Atmosphere: chic meets Applebees. We sat and ordered; actually a bit disappointed in the menu selection... too Americanized for my taste. Settled on the pitas with Greek fries. Food came super quick which was great. The food was decent. Our server however was not the friendliest, think she's in the wrong job as people skills were not one of her best qualities. Would I come again, sure if friends wanted to go here but I would not suggest this place/chain myself."}
{"text":"Craving lamb kabobs we tried MBFGR.  My guest ordered the lamb kabobs that come with roasted potatoes and a broccoli/cauliflower mix.  He loved the lamb, nice portion.  But the potatoes and vegetable mix were unremarkable.  Passable.  Perhaps a little garlic on the vegetables might have helped.  I had a pork souvlaki.  It came with a greek salad.  Pork was perfectly cooked and delish.  I am glad I didn't have the full dinner only to  suffer with the potatoes and tasteless veggies.  Management:  fix those veggies.  Do something!  
We found the desserts to be overpriced ($7) so we didn't partake."}
{"text":"Food was great, the portion of whatever I got was huge (wish I could remember after food coma) and wait staff was awesome, even with the kids."}
{"text":"I can leave it short - won't go again.
Food was below any restaurant standards, waitress are  clueless, even have to ask for fork and knife, since she did not get, that the dish she brought was no fingerfood"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and the food is average for greek food.  Im from chicago and would always go to greektown there  so I am stilll searching for a restaurant up to that par. I usually love greek chicken but found the chicken was a little bland here. The lemon rice soup was ok too but I noticed both times I had it it was only lukewarm. The servers I had both times were very nice."}
{"text":"My first visit and I will go back tomorrow   First the hostess was amazing  Greeted us like we were family and show us to our table quickly.  Our server was just a continuation of the hostess.  She brought our drink order and we ordered the Calamari as an app.  That was the bomb Calamari and the sauce was a perfect accent.  Now let me tell you about The Big Fat Greek Burger.  A true work of art    A perfectly cooked medium rare patty with sliced greek beef and the feta cheese and  tzatziki  was a cool refreshing accent but the sliced cucumber put it over the top!!"}
{"text":"After going here for years the Greek fell out of our grace with a menu change and tini Martinis.   Well were pleasntly surprised to see our fave items back on menu (Fetta Burger) and real sized Martinis.   Mike G. was great, pleasant and efficient.   Plus they always honor any Yelp coupon, unlike other Greek restaurants (Zorbas).  Bravo Greek...."}
{"text":"Lots of great things to say about this location which now serves a huge breakfast menu. The Sausage Sandwich is amazing as are the pizzas especially the \"Chopped Pizza\" You will experience a wide variety of choices on the menu all the food is fresh and the service is outstanding. Plenty of outside seating and a bar area with flat screen TVs. Greek is not always my first choice of food however this quality casual dining experience keeps me coming back. Opa!"}
{"text":"Love their \"2 for Two for $20!\"

We had 2 dogs with us and we asked if the restaurant was pet friendly.  They said that the city of Tempe won't allow it, but if we sat next to the sidewalk and kept the dogs on the sidewalk, we'd be welcome to stay.  We did, enjoyed it, and appreciated the staff going the extra distance for us.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  Good food, good prices, good service and the happy hour is awesome!  There have been times that I have eaten here every day.  My favorite things on the menu would be the Greek Salad with chicken, flaming saganaki, keftedes especially on happy hour, and the kyrokefteri dip not sure if I spelled that right.  The pita bread is unlike any other Mediterranean restaurant its a better quality thicker, buttery tasting and just amazing.  Thats just a bonus to the great food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"Being a die-hard Greek food fan, I was hesitant to try a Greek chain. But lo and behold the food is actually pretty good, even if it veers slightly askew of \"traditional.\" 

The tzatziki is amazing, but heavy on the lemon flavor. The spanakopita is huge and delightful. Their gyros come wrapped in a green tortilla (wha?) but are otherwise tasty. Baklava - get it! - but don't share if you don't have to. Oh, the baklava is big enough to share, but you won't want too. I love going in early on a weekend when the place is practically empty."}
{"text":"Visited 5/28/12...

This was a whim on Memorial Day Weekend. It was very quiet.  Which means quick service for us.

Had the Gyro Platter.  As appetizer I recommend the Greek Fries.  Also the Flamming Feta.  I did have a side salad.  Disappointed that it lacked the olives that would make this better.

Dessert, we had Flamming Baklava.  Yep, that did it..

I have been to this chain several times.  Never had a bad meal.  Great for lunch too.  Sill the best Gyro I can find around."}
{"text":"All I can say is - YUM. Hubby and I went in last night for dinner because we had a www.restaurant.com certificate. We started out with the Flaming Saganaki, which was soooo delicious. And I loved the way they flame it at your table! Although it was a bit on the small side, it definitely made up for itself in taste. I ordered the Gyro Platter with a pita on the side, and hubby got the Braised Lamb. The entree portions are huge! My platter was very tasty, although I didn't care for the potatoes. That's just a personal taste, not that they were bad or anything. The gyro meat was a tad on the dry side, but that just might be how it always is. I tried a bite of hubby's lamb and it was also very good! He couldn't stop raving about how he loved it even when we got home. Our bill was only $27 after our certificate! How awesome is that?! The Braised Lamb alone is $19.99! Service was great, and it wasn't very busy so that was nice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We go often with family, and the place is pretty good. 

They recently stopped their happy hour inside, which is one of the reasons that I've downgraded it from a 4-star to a 3-star. They only have it on the patio and the bar, where before they had it all over the restaurant. It's summer; nobody is going to want to sit outside in the baking heat for happy hour when you could go somewhere nearby and get happy hour prices. 

My husband and I always get the Aegean club and split it. It's great--chicken, bacon, and gyro meat on pita bread with lettuce, tomato, and onion. Perfection. The red sangria is awesome. My in-laws always get the stuffed peppers, and they are ALSO divine. 

The last time we were in, there was live music. The gentleman who was performing was wonderful. It was the only time we'd seen there. 

The silverware is often dirty (I've had to exchange mine two of the last three times I've been in) and the service is just okay, but the food makes up for it. If you're craving Greek, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"my husband and i ate here thursday night. i had chicken skewers and veggies, and lemon roasted potatoes. the dish was amazing. my husband had the gyro meat platter with rice and veggies, and it was also incredible and full of flavor. the service provided by hannah was excellent. we are from out of town and highly recommend this restaurant. a+ thursday 6:30 pm"}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite until the food started going downhill. But, they have reversed this decline!! The last two or three visits have been excellent. I don't know if they got a new chef, or, manager, but, it has certainly improved. Their Calamari Salad is now back to excellence. The gyros had gotten dry and tasteless, but, no more....flavorful and moist. Whatever happened, keep up the good work...."}
{"text":"Just ordered a Chicken Pesto Pita with a greek salad for lunch as takeout... 
Not sure what secret code you have to input to have the salad come with dressing, but it did make the bag lighter to carry. Luckly they made up for it with an inedible pita featuring burnt chicken, disgusting pesto, and the saddest tomatoes I've seen outside of a Veggie Tales movie. 

I'm not sure if they've just completely given up since Pita Jungle is opening just down the street, but this place used to be much better. As it stands now it can't seem to get much worse."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had any issues here, and my husband and I have been multiple times since its switch from a TGIFs. Please note- this review is only for the bar. I haven't sat in the dining area before. 

We usually get the gyro salad, and always love it! But, surprisingly, their absolutely best dish is their Greek gyro pizza. Yea, pizza. It is BOMB! And so bad for you, but so good! And it's a lot for only about $11 so I can take 1/2 home with me and eat for the next day's lunch or dinner. We were told their items are made from scratch, which is cool knowing they're not just using frozen dough. 

The only thing my husband didn't love was their spaghetti and meatballs, which I am not sure why he ordered that in the first place... from a Greek restaurant... yea.

Go during happy hour- they have $3 SKYY vodka, which is pretty much the best vodka deal in town, usually only well vodka is that cheap. You also get a lot of hummus for only $4. The flaming cheese isn't a lot, but eh, it's $4. 

Daniel, Brandon and Julie are the best bartenders, too! They always get us drinks fast and keep 'em coming."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent price, easy to get take-out.  

I ate here  while at a work conference at the Sheraton across the street from the Arizona Center.  The place was almost empty on a Friday night.  I got take out, which they prepared in about 5 minutes, and I was on my way.  The food was good, and got the job done :)"}
{"text":"Small selection which I love.  I hate going to a place that has a hundred menu items because you know it's all frozen and it's hard to figure out.  Cheesecake factory is a prime offender. The beef and lamb are very good. The Zeus beer is excellent as well. Nice atmosphere.

Update: 
The last time I was there someone broke a plate and everyone yelled opa!  I thought that was a fun way to make light of someone's mistake but when it happened every thirty minutes I realized this is their dancing gimmick like at Texas road house or joes crab shack. It scared the crap out me every time and is no welcome when I'm trying to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Service was friendly with the just the right amount of attentiveness. Lunch prices were reasonable. I had the gyro with Greek salad. This was certainly edible but nothing special. The tzatziki was a little bland, the lamb was a bit dry, the pita was good. Also shared a calamari appetizer which was ok. The outdoor patio was large and the noise level was mild. Overall, it was a satisfactory dining experience."}
{"text":"I first visited this location a few months ago for lunch. My pita and sweet potato fries tasted great, and the price was extremely reasonable. The service was OK, but since I was eating lunch with friends, we focused more on our conversation than on our server. I returned last week with my husband for dinner, and the experience was not as positive. The restaurant seemed pretty slow, and wait staff were milling around the register at the front (which seemed unprofessional). Our server was friendly, but he gave inaccurate advice about menu items. Consequently, I was unable to eat my selection. However, he did apologize and bring over the manager, who deducted my entree from the bill. I do appreciate them making it right, but I didn't order anything else and filled up on my french fries, instead. My husband thought his stuffed peppers were OK. They were prepared as described, but he just didn't love the taste. Our chocolate desert was pretty good, so our experience ended on a decent note. The restaurant's decor is Mediterranean-inspired and quite attractive. The menu seems to offer a nice range of authentically Greek/Mediterranean food, which is a unique departure from the dull chains scattered throughout Gilbert. However, the restaurant just lacks energy, and I fear it may not survive the Crossroads corridor for long."}
{"text":"Everything was fine.  It just wasn't good enough to warrant a return.

We were seated quickly.  My girlfriend noticed some of the restaurant looked a little dirty and out-of-date.  

Odd to say, but the water tasted terrible.  I guess that's a way to get you to order a drink.  The food was good.  Big portions for sure.  We ended up wrapping up a good portion of our meals to have for lunch the next day.

As we try more and more restaurants in the area, it seems like the bar is raising.  Unfortunately, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is good, but doesn't quite make the cut."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to this store. The food was great and the servers were friendly (especially Jeff who gave my roomie and I a sample of some tasty sangria). I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent prices.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food and fast service. Flaming feta was excellent and the gyro platter was excellent."}
{"text":"We have never been to this restaurant and wanted to try it out.  We went two weeks ago on a Monday and were seated right away.  The food was fresh, the staff seemed friendly and all was well.  I was even going to give this place 5 stars due to our dining experience.  We paid with a visa for our check and left our waitress Ashley a tip for her not stellar but good service of about 15%.  The next day we went into our account only to find out that the original amount was taken out plus $10, since it was still pending we didn't think nothing of it.  Two days later it posted and thankfully we had a copy of our receipt that showed a zero for the tip since we had tipped her cash.  We called management and they wanted a copy of the receipt which we then preceded to drive back and hand it to him personally.  He took the receipt to the back and brought a copy of what Ashley the waitress had turned in and to our disbelief SHE had written herself an additional $10 tip apart from the cash we gave her.  The manager was in shock and reimbursed us right away; he handled it very professionally.  I might call to see if they still employ this dishonest worker and if they do; please beware and CHECK your receipts. I wonder how many more people she ripped off. As long as Ashley works there we will never step a foot in that restaurant."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, an extra star for the service.

I met my girlfriend here for lunch on a weekday. When I arrived she was already seated (right next to the door so we got the hot breeze anytime someone opened it...oh well) and our server was right there so he brought mine and my kids drinks right away. The longer we were there, the more packed it became. This place must do really well during the week for lunch.

I ordered the gyro with fries ($8) and my kids both had mac and cheese with applesauce ($4.99). It's surprising that there is nothing \"greek\" on the kids menu. Instead, it's your typical \"I can get this boring, typical kids food anywhere\" food. My girlfriend ordered the pork souvlaki sandwich, per our servers recommendation, with a greek salad (also $8). The servings were a good size, her salad was pretty big, and the fries portion was large too. We ordered the sun-dried tomato hummus but it didn't come out so we asked about it when he brought our food. Apparently the kitchen had the tickets messed up. He comped us on that, and it was pretty good. Small portion for $5 and not enough pita. 

I think that they have deals every once in awhile on groupon, or living social...not 100% sure which site I have seen them on. I would snatch one if I saw it again, and use that to come back. There are tons of other options out there if I am paying full price."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite places for lunch ... love love the jalapeno hummus ... and the chicken breast pita ... try the Greek fries they r to die for"}
{"text":"Tonight, I dined at my big fat Greek for the first time at the Temp location. I was served byJoe. He was a wonderful server, knowledgeable about the food and drinks. And as long as their are employees like joe that work here, then this is great restaurant to dine at."}
{"text":"There aren't many times in my life I have to send an entree back, but this is one. Bland. Alfredo. Sauce. My worst enemy. I get the same crap back with a discussion that back of house has altered the dish to my taste. Note to the GM. Don't lie to the guest, when they know bland food when they taste it. I gave you leave to amend your defect and I get a defensive GM. Sorry shouldn't ever be in your vocabulary. Fix it. Say you were wrong, and fix the damn dish. You had one chance, and blew a second. I gave my leftovers to a homeless person, and he thought it  was crap also."}
{"text":"We had a motorcycle meetup at this restaurant, and I was positively impressed.  Bathrooms are clean.  Restaurant is clean.  Service is excellent.  And I had a vegetarian pizza, which was very good.  The location is great with plenty of well lighted parking.  Overall, I would say this restaurant is an excellent choice for eating out because the menu has lots of different food choices (ex. I like to eat vegetarian).  Quantities are on the large side, so you might want to split some items with another person in your party."}
{"text":"Wow...tasty, tasty, tasty! The variety of hummus is amazing...warm, toasty pita...the lamb was so tender and the spices were amazing! My friend who's shy about trying new things dabbled in everything, but most of all loved the flaming cheese, Saganaki...OPA! We usually pass on dessert but who could pass on the baklava cheesecake! The staff was so polite and just so on top of everything! The owner came over to chat and it was wonderful to learn he was Greek and we really appreciate the Ouzo shots...talk about Greek hospitality! I wish we had one of these up in Flagstaff. The food brought me back in time when I was in Mykonos! Can't wait for my next trip to Phoenix to try something different at My Big Fat Greek restaurant and to enjoy the nice patio!"}
{"text":"So let me begin with the dessert! OMG! Cheesecake done Greek: TO DIE FOR!!! I have been without my husband for six months and this is the closest thing to a \"moment\" that I have had!  hehehehehehe!!! I cannot wait for him to get home to take him there if only for the cheesecake!

My meal was yummy as well!! The serving was a great size even if the meal was a little pricy.  I will surely go back there to eat again.  

It isn't a place for the romantic meeting due to the closeness of the seating but it is still a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Lunch special is a total steal. Got two gyros with a side salad and the specialty Greek fries for under $15 plus tax. Would come back for just the specialty fries. Fries loaded with Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, and this super yummy lemon sauce. Apparently they can do a loaded version with bacon, chicken, gyro meat on these fries. That sounds amazing right after a long night of partying!!"}
{"text":"The food was alright but not amazing, and the atmosphere lacking. We both had a Pita, and while my Gyro pita was good, my friend's pork pita wasn't and she said the meat was charred and dry. None of it was special enough to go out of our way to come back however. For a Greek restaurant this was disappointing. I still have it 3 stars because it's not terrible"}
{"text":"If you like lamb you can't go wrong with some Lamb Chops or the Lamb Shank! The service is excellent and quick."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, don't come here. We began with trying to get the waiters attention and our experience we down hill from there. We ordered the flaming feta. When it arrived, the smoke that came from the plate completely filled the place and lingered. The quality of the feta was the worst I have ever eaten. So salty, it was UN edible. The Greek salad was bland and the lettuce old. The spinach pie was a basic spinach pie that you can buy at a supermarket. Not only does this place have horrible food but it has terrible service."}
{"text":"Great-tasting food that caused both my wife and I to get sick later. Horrible waitress and manager. We won't be going back... ever!"}
{"text":"Meh, I tried both flaming cheese appetizers, my dish (some chicken) and the moose caca (I'm going to be hug alive for that one).

This was one of those dates you go on and its supposed to be the perfect match for you....you smile and laugh at all the strategic times, say your gonna call...and well then do the respectable thing and don't...ever...

Its kinda like that here for me.  It just didn't do it for me, I tried I really did, but I lost the number (or something)..."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere!  MUCH better place and less expensive than the Greek restaurant that we walked out of!  (See my previous review)."}
{"text":"Service - Horrible. The restaurant was nearly empty when our party of 8 sat down for lunch. The waitress did not seem to want to be there. The service was slow and unorganized. We requested additional sides (several times), which were not brought out until the end of the meal when all food had been eaten. Drinks were not re-filled until the end of the meal, and the food took a long time to arrive. When it did arrive much of it was cold. The server never came back to check on the food quality.

Food - We have been eating at this restaurant for years. My go-to item is always the gyros. The meat this time was cold and bland. The waitress forgot my tazyki sauce on the side and did not bring during the meal. The pita bread did not seem fresh. The only item that seemed unchanged was the rice and fries. Our table had mixed reviews of their food. Some really enjoyed it, while others were unimpressed.

Ambience - the restaurant decor is family oriented. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated very quickly. As mentioned previously, the servers have all changed over, and seemed to be very uninterested in taking care of their customers. 

Coupons - the waitress refused our coupons citing some store policies. Again they did not seem willing to try and help or provide a good solution. Not an issue, but a poor cap at the end of the meal. It was a perfect opportunity for service recovery for a relatively minimal investment or at least a customer friendly explanation. 

Although we have been patrons for years, I do not foresee rushing back. The service and food have really gone down hill."}
{"text":"I love greek food, and I love big portions, but yet I would still just rate this place 3 stars. The best part was our starter, which was the hummus sampler. Each hummus was tasty and flavorful. They were sort of skimping on the pita bread, but did not hesitate to bring us more when we asked. I ordered the falafel gyro, and it was good, but not great. I've definitely had better- even at the chain Pita Jungle. My dad ordered the Moussaka, and he thought it was delicious. Maybe if I come back, I will order that instead? My favorite part of the meal, as ridiculous as it sounds, was the massive water glasses. I guess I consume a lot of water with my meals, and always feel like I have to bug the servers to bring me more. Well that's definitely not an issue here! Overall, A-OK pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"Very authentic Greek restaurant. Excellent food quality and service. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome food. Had the gyro, greek fries, and salad. The calamari was alright, was not too impressed. Customer service was good. Parking is kind of hard depending on time of visit. Quick service though! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Big Fat is always good for a quick bite to eat. This location is hardly ever busy, but the service is always fast, friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night dinner a while back and it didn't disappoint at all. The food was amazing, the steak was delicious and however they season the potatoes is to die for. It was a little on the expensive side but the food, service and atmosphere were great. We have been and will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant the last time I was in Tempe, and liked it enough to go back a second time. Be sure to try the tyrokafteri appetizer -- it's like pimiento cheese with a kick! The food is decent, and they serve large portions; you'll have leftovers to take home. I see some complaints about slow service in the reviews, but both of the times I've been there it was perfectly acceptable. This place is definitely on my go-back list."}
{"text":"I LOVE Greek food.  Love.  I could eat greek/mediterranean food every day and be perfectly happy.  

I do NOT love MBFGR.

I went to MBFGR for lunch with some of my co-workers.  3 of the 5 of us are vegetarians, and MBFGR has several veggie options.  

I chose to have the \"regular\" sized greek salad.  It was the size of a dinner salad with iceberg lettuce, tomatos, feta, cucumbers, and greek dressing on the side.  It normally comes with onions and red peppers as well, but I didn't want them today.  It was a basic, run o' the mill greek salad, nothing special.  

The dressing was good, but not spectacular.  It was definitely not made in-house (it had that egginess that store bought dressings sometimes have).

$12 for a side/dinner salad and a drink is too spendy.  It was good, but come on!  I would have rather spent my money on the dry grilled cheese from Tom's Tavern!  

My lunch-mates had falafel, the veggie wrap, and a chicken wrap.  All thought the food was good.  

Maybe I will order something else next time (but I hope there is no next time.)

Don't go here.  Go to Athenian Express instead.  If you are a vegetarian, get a Veggie Pita with a side of fries or a salad, and be happy."}
{"text":"Worst service I've EVER EXPERIENCED at a restaurant. Sat there for 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. So if you like tap water and have lots of time on your hands try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great flaming cheese appetizers...but entrees are on cold plastic plates.  Nothing stays warm on their cold plastic plates.  If they could serve their hot food on heated plates like in most Mexican restaurants, the food would be more enjoyable to eat warm.  Same goes with the pizzas.  By the time the food is served, the plastic plates have sucked the warmth right out of the food, so the food is cold.  Plastic is okay for salads, but, please turn up the heat on the hot food dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happen from me previously eating the chicken soup but it didn't have that excellent lemon favor it usually had. It was a bit dull. Had a Cesar salad which dry but the chocolate cake was worth it."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give props to Greg (manager) and Alina (waitron) for helping us throw a surprise birthday party that went off without a hitch and was an enormous success. Delicious food, tremendous service for our large party and a very fun atmosphere. A wonderful experience was had by all!"}
{"text":"We had the hummus.  It was average nothing to write home about.  I had the beef and lamb gyros with salad.  It was your average gyros served with a Greek salad with iceberg lettuce. For the price not too bad.  It was lunch time on a Monday not too busy.  Waitstaff should people only have about an hour lunch.  Waitress disappeared on us, we finally got our check.  Again not bad and price point was good."}
{"text":"Tried the Grecian Delight Pizza and Aegean Club sandwich. Large & delicious portions! Would definitely recommend this location! Great service too."}
{"text":"Another fine dining experience. I love having Chelsea wait on us because everything. Is always perfect when she does.  Thanks for the consistent level of excellence."}
{"text":"Gyro pita/fries: $7. I always drink a lot of tea/water/whatever, so the large drink glasses are a plus right away. Huge outdoor seating area, subtle Minoan reference in decor and symbolism is very nice. The Gyro was a tad dry, but overall good. Service fast and courteous."}
{"text":"This is now \"My Greek Restaurant.\"  I do not know what is going on, but there were only two servers, a cook, and no manager.  There were just a couple of other patrons.  The food tastes odd, not Greek at all.  I tried getting my money back and was told there is no manager and they could do nothing.  They did give me a coupon but it is just a form with no phone number.  This is strange."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to eat at when I am in Arizona. I tell all my friends and family to check this place out whenever they're going to be in the area also.  I never have a whole new perspective on Greek food now! I love the Greek fries!!! My personal favorite is the Grecian Delight pizza. The specialty drinks are really yummy. The staff are really nice and attentive and prices are very reasonable. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Generally I'm a huge gyro person, but I guess I don't know my greek food well enough. We tried the flaming feta (nice fire/cheese display-it's an appetizer-crazy I know). I'm not a kefalograviera (greek cheese) fan, but if you are, you'd like it. Their portions were pretty big, the chicken souviald plate had sssooo much food on it, I wondered if we were ripping them off. 

Plenty of meat, potatos and vegetables. I barely put a dent in it since it was a lot of food, it was $12.95. Their drink cups are HUGE. I have no idea why, but it reminded me of those monsterous cups-Big gulps, that's right. Not bad. Waitress was pretty hot too, lol. Very nice, she made the suggestions for the food, it was great food, I'd like to go back!"}
{"text":"$4 appetizers, 1/2 off drinks during happy hour. 

We tried the hummus trio, Mediterranean crisp, shrimp & salmon. All delish and cheap!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food!

As cheesy as the name sounds, this restaurant doesn't disappoint!  

The food is excellent!  The menu is varied enough to please everyone from those with an experienced Mediterranean palate to those with very simple tastes.  

The flaming saganaki is a great combination of unique flavor and entertaining presentation.  The portions are large.  I have never had a larger gyro anywhere else.  If you like to experiment with different flavors and you like dips, I would recommend their combo dip appetizer..."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Been in a few times for lunch.  Get the salad with your gyro or chicken.  I am far from a salad tosser (haha!), but this salad is outstanding.  You'll spend less than you would at Subway for a far healthier meal here.

An additional bit of genius is serving their water in huge cups.  Don't have to keep bugging the staff for water if you happen to be really thirsty.  Every restaurant should do this."}
{"text":"Seriously, people. MBFGR is \"Mediterranean\" food capitalizing on a hokey movie that for some reason some people liked. There's a lot better to be had out there- try Pita Jungle, Flaming Kabob, or Byblos, for examples. I have also eaten once at the Mill avenue location and both places have been a testament to mediocrity-and that's being complimentary. Every server I have had here has been....well, let's just say \"special\"- or maybe stoned. The food served and what the menu describes are seldom the same. Please, I beg you, avoid this chain and get some real food at a local establishment crafted and served by people who know where Greece is."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time my wife and I have ever dined at MBFGR. I do not understand why so many people are crazy about this place. There was little about this restaurant that I found superb. 

Atmosphere: 4 stars 

My wife and I sat on the Patio since the weather was quite pleasant. They have candles lit on all the tables with grapevines draped above. The patio was well-equipped with space-heaters. The Silverware was neatly wrapped in a fresh linen napkin. 

Actually, I was quited impressed with presentation on some of the menu items. Our bruschetta was presented beautifully on a tile-like designed plate. I've rarely seen a restaurant use such expensive plateware. 

Food: 3 to 4 stars 

The bruschetta was excellent. I'd possibly go back just for that. However, this was NOT your traditional recipe for bruschetta. Most recipes, and therefore restaurants, serve bruschetta on a very hard, more thinly sliced, crusted bread. This was much softer which was very refreshing. Also, they serve it with a marinara sauce for dipping. While the sauce itself was nothing special, it is a nice twist on the recipe. Oh yes, its still topped with the usual tomatoes, Parmesan, balsamic vinegar, and what's that?? green onions?? yup, good stuff. 

For entrees, my wife ordered a White Pizza which was a pizza with Alfredo sauce, mozzarella cheese, basil, and chicken. I had a couple of pieces. I was not impressed. Too much chicken, not enough basil or Alfredo sauce. It lack great flavor. 

I ordered a pita since that's what I was craving. I was hoping for so much more from a well-reviewed Greek restaurant in the valley. No, romaine lettuce, only iceberg?! The Tatziki sauce was SO BLAND. I'm not even Greek and I make better Tatziki than that at home and I don't even use real Greek yogurt in mine. Also, the chicken should be a bit more chopped. The big pieces don't allow for proper and even distribution between the chicken, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, etc. 

Simply put: I'VE HAD BETTER PITAS AT THE MALL. 

Service: 2 and 1/2 stars 

Having worked in the restaurant business, I know that patio sections are not always staffed with it's own server. You can usually expect slower service on the patio. However, definitely did not pay us enough attention. 

She did not introduce herself -- no name. She did not mention any of the extra charges for substituting items. Not cool. And she did a 
\"fly-by-how-is-everything?\" once without even taking time to stop at the table. She literally did not stop walking past us while she asked. 

Now, the food-runners were extremely helpful, polite, and understanding. If it wasn't for them, I would've been so upset I would have asked to speak with a manager. 

Cleanliness: 3 and 1/2 stars 

The bathroom needed some deep cleaning attention and restocking. But other than that, the restaurant look clean overall."}
{"text":"We went there in April 2011. We ordered three dishes. The meat (kabobs) was moist and flavorful. However,  the rice was just too salty. There is a difference between flavorful and salty. The rice is just salty."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp & chicken souvlaki kabob w/ pita bread and veggies. It was a bit overcooked yet still flavorful. Patio dining with a beautiful scenery made it extra special."}
{"text":"There was four of us who went here today for a late lunch.  My wife Carol, our friend Kathy R. and a close friend of mine from Oaklahoma Cliff Y and of course me.

I don't even know where to begin about this restaurant, right from the get go I knew there was going to be problems. We started off with  appetizers. When the dolmades was served it was slightly warm to the touch. The Flaming Saganaki (slice of cheese set on fire) was excellent in addition to being an impressive presentation it was darn cool.
 
So our food comes out, this is where things turned bad...here is what we all got:
Our friend Kathy R. -  Mousaka - When it was served the Sautéed veggies were somewhat warm but more on the cold side. The Mousaka was frozen in the middle. She asked for it to be reheated. Her soup was not hot so she also sent that back to be reheated. Of course when the Mousaka and soup returned both were very hot.  BUT when Kathy tasted her dish she said this is so bad it it was inedible and didn't eat the Mousaka. I thing she had her soup.

My friend Cliff Y. said he enjoyed his Gyro plate and told me everything was fine. But that was probably because he was extremely hungry before his food arrived or he was just being polite.

My wife, Carol had  a a combo pork and chicken kebab. It came out , marginally  warm this included the roasted potatoes, veggies and meat so she sent it all back to be reheated. When her dish returned she ate it and enjoyed her food.

My dish - I ordered a combination plate which consisted of a Beef & veggie kebab. I started off my meal with a side salad, it was good but a salad is a  salad. The Beef and veggie kebab like everyine elses that was served during our visit was barely this included the roasted potaotes, meat and veggies. I was so disappoinyed I simply pushed my meal aside and did not eat it. There is nothing more discusting as food served lukewarm. Ontop of everything else my beef kebob was over cooked and dry. Yick! When asked if I wanted something else I said no just take it away. 

With all the food that was sent back and our comments / complaints during dinner to our waitress the manager never came out to speak to us. Instead another waitress compt'd us a couple of deserrts and gave me two $10.00 gift certificates (good for one gift certificate per table per visit) for on our next vist. This is one a $96.00 bill. I was curious about the restaurant so I asked \" Is everything made in advance and just reheated here\". She told me all the food is prepaired fresh and cooked daily. I seriously doubt it.

FOOD: Honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me. A real disappointment. The presentation of the food on our plates was impressive but that is where it stopped. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: Our waitress Mercedes was polite, attentive and courteous.  AMBIENCE: The restaurant is pretty and has a lovely atmosphere  CONCLUSION:  I left so upset, disappointed and unsatisfied. I wasn't a bit Impressed. I can say with 100% certainty, I will not being going back... fhe cold food did me in."}
{"text":"Two words: Lunch Special. This place has reopened after a grease fire almost a year ago. I was never inside before the fire, but they have a nice long bar and good seating and most importantly great food so far. The lunch special pitas are all 5 bucks and can be taken to-go which I did - to the lake. I ordered the falafel which was three giant spheres of fresh falafel laying gently inside a warm open faced (but foldable) hot pita. The sesame sauce was on the side (nice and thick) and onions, lettuce also included. For 99 cents extra, you can add fries, rice or greek salad, so a top notch lunch is available for just $6. The rice was pretty good too with fresh cut peppers inside and on top. Looks like this place will be great for lunch and the flaming cheese is on the menu here also, a must have for a good greek joint. Dinner way more pricey."}
{"text":"My first time to this restaurant and the food was amazing ,delicious and very fresh.
The staff was so nice and very helpful, especially. Nicole....great place . We\"ll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I thought they had really turned things around for a while there.  I have ordered a few salads to go and only been in a handful of times since the reopen.  Quality of food and service had gone up however my recent experience was back to the usual lower quality presentation and the same low quality service that I had become accustomed to prior to the fire. On our most recent visit My husband and I came in with friends and I didnt want to bring attention to the really bad attitude the server had but when we got home my husband said something about how rude and weird our server was.  We definitely noticed the same thing so I am sure my friends did as well.  That alone is enough to not want to make another visit.  My salad was not at all what I would usually expect.  I took a picture of the sad little salad.  This one was definitely the worst they have ever made for me.  I got a picture of it just to remind myself not to bother coming back again.  My server had such a crappy attitude that I didnt even want to say anything about the salad.  Not sure what his problem was.  The restaurant seemed pretty empty and we made 0 complaints and still got treated like crap."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is just, alright. I came here with a bunch of co-workers for lunch last week, and wasn't very impressed. I got the hummus which was pretty good and the lunch special which consisted of a beef gyro and Greek salad.. it was decent, but I wasn't floored with the quality of food. The price was perfect though, a good deal for the amount of food they pile on the plate. I will give them a star for the sheer fact that the cups they serve their drinks in are enormous. I dont think anyone needed a refill. The passion fruit tea is tasty, the waitresses are really friendly and the atmosphere isn't completely terrible, its just the food that was the Debby downer, kind of like this snore-fest of a review."}
{"text":"I had the Mousaka. It was tasty but a little 'mushy\" it was served with rice or roasted potatoes and steamed veggies.
I got the rice. A little salty and too soft for me.
My husband had the gyro with a salad. It was good. The Mythos Greek beer served in a bottle was also tasty, light and a good summer beer.
The baklava was exceptional! 
Service was good. 
We will return to try other Greek dishes."}
{"text":"I pretty much get the same couple things. Spanikopita &/or Greek salad, or Gyro. I recently tried the chopped pizza. Surprisingly good!  A thin crust pizza with chopped toppings including gyro meat and pepperoni. I also like the lamb shoulder (not sure if all locations offer this). Its so tender a flavorful! You can't leave w/o having the Baklava for dessert! 

I think kids under 12 eat free (perhaps select locations)! That's always a bonus for parents! The only 'bad\" thing for me is their wine selection has alot to be desired. Great Happy Hour btwn 4-7 and a Reverse Happy Hour after 10. 

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"i have to admit that i was surprised that the food wasn't as bad as the movie. generally, it goes it against my principles to eat a chain restaurant named after a movie, but when i'm forced to go with friends, its not so bad."}
{"text":"Very good service and awesome food! Our server was Mike G and he was informative and knew the menu well! We will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"I usually eat lunch here and have enjoyed each visit over the last three years. The ambiance is fun and bright along with efficient servers and fantastic food! This restaurant is located in the Arizona Center complex so park in the garage or along the street."}
{"text":"Had the calzone with mozeralla cheese, spinach, Alfredo sauce, jalapeños, and onions. Amazing taste. Definitely recommend all vegetarians to order this next time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food here is great. Delicious. I want to lick my overstuffed plate. Drinks are potent. But it's the other stuff, the small details...

Like how the last time I went, we were one of only 4 tables in the place but they were seating everyone along the same row of booths against the wall. So, they wanted to put me and my husband, on a date, in between two tables of unruly children. Oh hell no. They were very cooperative and prompt when accommodating our request to move elsewhere. 

And like how our flaming saganaki was not flaming. It was hot and melty, so perhaps they set it ablaze before it reached us, but that rather defeats the purpose, no?

But the staff is always very friendly and, as I said, the food can't be beat."}
{"text":"Some of the best baklava you will ever have! Not so sweet and right on the spot with the cream served. Their lamb leg is awesome along with all the cheese platters. Greatservice and location."}
{"text":"We asked to sit inside (party of 9) but they sat us outside... no biggie.

Hummus was incredible, but not enough pita.

Falafel was terrible. Dry with little flavor. I heard the gyros and chicken were decent though."}
{"text":"My husband and I went  here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  We had previously been to the one in Goodyear which has since closed so we went up  here .  The atmosphere is not as good as the old restaurant it is basically a regular restaurant that serves greek food.  The food was good however the service was not.  I asked for a glass of water and was half way through my meal when I fially  got it.  Also my husband asked the waitress what the vegetables were and she just said I don't know, I know they are steamed and never offered to go check to find out.  He played it safe and ordered something else.  Obviously we didn't see our waitress much while we were eating,.

As I said the food was good so if you are just looking for food you may want to go, if you want a restaurant with atosphere I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Can I give ZERO STARS? Went in for lunch today. Sat in booth for about 15 minutes with not even an offer of water. Left without ever seeing a server. Each of the tables around us were receiving service by multiple servers. Asked a few people outside walking into a nearby restaurant and they informed this was pretty typical of the \"lack of\" service."}
{"text":"The Agaean club sandwich, if I spelled it correctly, is friggin' huge, and amazing, as are the Greek style frnch fries..stunning fries of the finest caliber, but you HAVE to ensure they are the GREEK style from the menu. The flaming Greek cheese is absolutely amazing, as well as the hummus - cannot go wrong with the hummus."}
{"text":"Just to start - have a homemade Margarita.  They come in several different flavors.  The staff is super friends and knows everything about the menu.  I have not had anything bad here that I wouldn't recommend.  I did try the variety of Humus and was not thrilled with all of them - but anything else was AMAZE!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is really good. The flaming cheese is a bit expensive for the portion size though. I also wish the staff would learn about bar drinks. I ordered a Lemon drop. It is suppose to come chilled,up in a martini glass with a sugar rim (that's what makes it taste like the lemon ball candy) it is NOT served in a highball glass over rocks with straws ."}
{"text":"Awesome service + delicious food .. and they had a good live band playing as well !! We ordered the gyro platter and lamb chops ... lamb chops were cooked well and the gyro was tasty also."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Beautiful, great variety, wonderfully served, friendly service. Best gyro ever!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was slow. Never offered refills and took about 10 minutes to flag someone down to seat us."}
{"text":"We felt like trying a new greek restaurant. And this was the closest on our GPS. Everything was good. I had baklava for dessert it was even better than I remember baklava being. Try it !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here this afternoon to get the lobster ravioli, which is delicious. We were seated only to find they did not have that dish at this location! That was disappointing. 

Started with the jalapeno cilantro hummus, it was pure deliciousness. My boyfriend got a burger, and I decided to go with the grilled shrimp and salmon salad. I asked for it without red onion. 

Our food came quickly, and to my dismay my salad was infested with not only red onion, but white onion too! White onion wasn't even on the description of the dish. The salmon was tough and tasted absolutely horrible (couldn't decide if it was cooked frozen or just expired!). The balsamic dressing lacked flavor. The only edible thing in the salad were the shrimp, and I think there was only four of them. It was disgusting, do not order it.

My boyfriend asked for yellow mustard for his burger, and they didn't have any. They serve burgers!!! Why would they not have that?! There are many neighboring restaurants that I'm sure have it, and it was slow. Our waitress could have easily gone next door and got some. He doesn't like ketchup, so he decided to just take it home and eat it with mustard rather than eat it plain at the restaurant.

After about twenty minutes our waitress dropped off the check. She didn't even ask how the food was, or give me a chance to tell her, and both of our plates were pretty much untouched at this point. After waiting twenty more minutes, she brought the credit card back so we could leave, and we did. 

I give it one star because the hummus was delicious, and my boyfriend told me he enjoyed his burger when he had it at home. Service was lacking. It is a server's job to take care of the guests of the restaurant, and I did not feel that we were taken care of today. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The family platter with everything Greek blew us away......huge platter piled high with chicken, gyro, lamb chops, steak skewers, Greek style potatoes, rice.........if you're in Tempe you must visit!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Hot food which is increasing rare to be served these days. Fresh and tasty,while the atmosphere was  relaxing, sat on the patio surrounded by tall palm trees lite with decorative lights.The service was friendly and prompt. Great for larger groups of people."}
{"text":"My wife and I flew in from Minnesota today and our wings were very tired.  We got a recommendation from the motel desk and trotted down there.  A nice looking place with a homey ambiance in student central area on Mill St.

Nice menu...three of my favorites and something that looked really good: Greek spaghetti.  garlic, extra virgin olive oil, feta, Kaseri.  since I loves spaghetti con aglia y olio from the Italian camp, I had to try it.   delicious. 

We shared very tasty fried calamari.  The white sauce had an interesting touch of heat.

My wife loved her sweet and sour grilled salmon on the special.  And I liked it a lot, too.  Raw baby spinach with an interesting dressing on the side.  

The congenial manager or owner dropped by our table to check on us and we had a nice chat.

Frankly, this place is a better meal than the three Greek places we enjoy in Rochester, although it was a bit spendier.  

Our meal with a glass of wine, and a pint of ale ran $50 before tip; we'd be happy to go here again next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a buddy of mine after golf for lunch, and we both really liked it.  I had a gyro and greek salad, and both were very enjoyable.  I loved the taziki sauce. (I think thats right).

As noted is some of the other reviews, it is casual dining.  Plastic plates and all.  I just didn't mind.  

Service could be a bit faster, but the food was great.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for several years now, back when Eva use to be the bartender on Friday/Saturday nights. The place has unfortunately become more deserted since then and I have noticed the portions have gotten smaller and smaller.  The waiter/ waitresses have become more, for lack of a better word, colorful. Pink hair, tattoos, excessive facial piercings and highly unprofessional attire and attitude. This place use to be one of my absolute favorite spots and now I seem to avoid coming back. I was here for lunch last week and I was again unimpressed. The plate I was served was cracked and it seems as if there is no more pride in serving great food on whole plates. Again the serving size has been cut in half, however the taste of the food is still there."}
{"text":"Was in AZ for work purposed and I'm so sad I discovered this place towards the end of my stay. My co-workers came here twice and we loved everything we ordered. I personally loved the chicken plate and the hummus sampler, but one thing I adored was the dessert . . .Greek Honey Balls! This has got to be one of the best desserts I've had. It makes me sad we don't have this place in CA."}
{"text":"Had the gyro. Was great also tried a few desert. All were good. Decent price good food good service, fast and friendly"}
{"text":"So I came to this joint today for lunch with my wife and and a coworker of hers.  I ordered (of course) the Greek Salad with gyro meat on top.  Our waiter's name was Jeff, and he was great.  He introduced himself and also reminded us halfway through our meal of his name again.  If that doesn't show confidence in his work I don't know what does.  He kept our glasses filled, and our food came incredibly fast.

My salad was excellent.  I ordered the regular size and it was huge!  God forbid I had ordered the large one, little ethiopian kids would have been cursing my name!  The meat was a little too thin for my liking, but it was good.  Honestly when I ordered the salad and a gyro I expected to get the gyro in sandwich form (inside a pita)... but its coo.  I'm really not one to complain if the food is good.

My wife got the veggie wrap and a side greek salad.  It looked good, but I'm not a big wrap person unless its extremely unhealthy.  Like a chipotle chicken wrap at Tacone or something... You know the one.  With the spicy orange mayo throughout it.  Anywho, this place is excellent for lunch.  They get you in and out and the food is worth the price.  I think we ended up paying $22 for both of us.

Clean plates
Great service
Pleasant buzz
Delicious food"}
{"text":"Big fat Greek restaurant great place to some great food. My husband and I love big fat because it is cheap and we always use restaurant.com gift cards. Our favorites are the meat kebabs and I like the gyros and beef pasta dishes.  Alcoholic drinks are not that expensive either."}
{"text":"We like Greek food. This is the best in the area though it is not as good as some in other cities. We came for lunch. My wife had the souvlaki plate which had pork and beef souvlaki, I think as well as some sides on the plate. I had Athenian pasta which was noodles with different cheeses including mithra which I like.  This was very rich and I remembered it later through indigestion. I paid extra for a Greek side salad. It was not well put together compared to others I have had being a lot of lettuce, about 1/8 of a tomato in cubes and one kalamata olive in a place of honor. There may have been some cucumber slices too. Retsina wine is my drink of choice at Greek restaurants. It was ok here. Service was not good.  We waited several minutes to be noticed once seated. The waitress was nice but I hate the excuse of being short staffed as a reason for bad service. I did correct the bill which otherwise would have undercharged us. We will be back though not immediately."}
{"text":"The meat lovers platter was awesome and HUGE. I had the Mousaka which was alright nothing special. The service was great though you may have to wait a little if you have a large party in which I did.

Be aware of the cheese aroma here. I crave for fresh air or better ventilation."}
{"text":"Simply the best Meditteranean food in AZ. I love their Lamb Shanks and when im not too hungry the Gyro wrap or the Pork Souvlaki is spot on. The service is great and I love the Greek beers on tap. The calamari is a must. When my son was little he was a big fan of their avgolemono soup."}
{"text":"Great food! They have something for everyone here.  The vegetarian Mousaka is one of my favorite thins on the menu.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"The gyro wrap is great for lunch and in will be going back again soon.  The fries are just okay, but the mt Kilimanjaro serving will appeal to the glutton in you."}
{"text":"Love the Greek salad with chicken...and a glass of Reisling really set the tone. The pita bread?? Aww, forget about it! It was so delicish!

The place was slow for a Sunday afternoon. Staff was very attentive. Food and beverages came in a reasonable amount of time. And the serving sizes are very respectable! 

Indoor/outdoor seating available. Or call in and pick up. Your choice. 

Love the atmosphere, quality of food, friendliness of staff...and parking is so convenient. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Maybe I should preface this by saying that I come from Chicago originally where we had a \"Greek Town\" where we could get great Greek food.

Dorothy, you are not in Kansas anymore (or ws it Chicago?).

I have walked past the place many times (I live a block away).  The name was too kitchy, it looked like a chain and it was in a touristy shopping center, all alarms.  But, my lovely wife wanted Greek food so off we went.

They have a very large place with plenty of tables. We were there on a Saturday night and they were not even 1/3 full.  

Things that went wrong:

- They burned the saganaki.  Not only ours, but we smelled a couple more burned attempts during our meal.
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
- the food was soaked in oil.  I mean soaked!
- when asked what vegetables were included if we picked them over the rice or potatoes we were told \" sautéed carrots, peppers and cucumbers\"  \"Cucumbers? are you sure?\" was our response.  \"Yes, I think so\"  we ordered them assuming our young waiter was wrong.  Of course he was, they were zucchini.  How can you have a waiter not know the difference between cucumbers and zucchini at a Greek restaurant.

We will not return unless we have a great coupon and a greater need for Greek food."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to this restaurant after a really grueling Saturday swim endurance practice, and it turned out to be a good choice. The staff was friendly and attentive, our appetizer (sun-dried tomato hummus) and entrees (gyro dinner, pastichio) arrived fast, which we appreciated because we were really hungry. The food was good and the portions generous. Although I would have appreciated brighter lighting, the dimly lit evening atmosphere did make for a more relaxing experience."}
{"text":"This was a good place for me to find food and refreshment while I waited for my friend to finish transacting business in the nearby Tempe City Hall. The restaurant is located in the heart of Tempe's near-ASU commercial area of Mill Ave, so while the location is convenient, parking was a bit of a problem. I was not anticipating a long wait for my friend so I ordered just some apps: sweet chill calamari and Greek fries; both were excellent. Because I was going to drive soon, I limited my drinking to just a tall glass of refreshing iced lemonade. Service was friendly, seating was comfortable, and the food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"\"Meh\"

Yep.. that's it folks. Big portions, slow service, bland sides. The best part of the experience was the platter we had. The hummus was pretty tasty as were the zucchini thingies. I had a Chicken Souvlaki and Shrimp Souvlaki with potatoes and veggies. I question whether either of them were completely done, but the meat was quite tasty.

I looked around and it seems that it had a meh experience for most of my dining party. I won't be back anytime soon, but glad I got to go."}
{"text":"Good Greek food, but a little pricey.  We enjoyed out meal and our little girl had a nice time in their outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"This place was pretty dead on a Friday night. 

Maybe it's because there are a lot of other options in this area. I know there's a Z Tejas around the corner and another trendy restaurant near here too.

That's kind of a shame. It always sucks to see more staff members hanging around than there are diners. 

I ordered the feta burger. I've had this several times before. It's really good. I ordered fries along with it and I wasn't too pleased with them. It tasted like they gave me the \"end of the day\" fries. It was very oily and not too fresh. I only had a few bites. 

My wife got the spanikopita. That was good. The waiter let us sub out the rice and stuff for pita bread.

The server was nice. But for really no one inside the restaurant, the service was very slow."}
{"text":"this place is beyond good, i like the food and the ppl are very nice. service is exceptional and very friendly and customer oriented"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Ordered the feta burger. Service treated me well. I would probably just come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"From my prior tip, yes, we had a big fat Greek lunch here yesterday, and it was GREAT!  This is epic so brace yourselves.  

This is the only BFGR location I've visited and we always have a great time.  I've taken Mr. M, I've taken a group of girlfriends, I've taken a group of coworkers and they've never let us down. 

I'm still thinking about yesterday's lunch so that's what I'm going to write about.  We sat at the bar and each ordered a glass of retsina.  It took awhile for the wine to make its way to us.  Our server was very nice, but at one point she stopped by with two wine glasses and said, \"I'll have so and so make your sangria because he does a better job.\"  I politely reminded her we had ordered 2 glasses of retsina, and she gave me kind of a blank look and said, \"Oh, I don't know if we carry that anymore.\"  Uh....we had ordered it about 12 minutes and 47 seconds ago....

I happened to glance over at the wine/beer cooler and saw a yellow label that looked like it had Greek writing on it.  I asked her if that was it, and sheepishly, she said \"Yes\", and immediately poured us two healthy glasses of that wonderful wine.  

Ah.  I'm happy.

Mr. M was Jonesin' for a gyro so that's what he ordered with the Greek fries.

I ordered one kebab of chicken souvlaki and one of the beef souvlaki with the Greek potatoes and a Greek side salad.  

Everything was delicious.  We were passing the gyro back and forth.  It was overstuffed and had all the right flavors and plenty of gyro meat stuffed in that soft pita.  And the Greek fries....don't get me started.  Those are ridiculous with the feta cheese, seasoning, and sauce they drizzle over those.  I don't know what it is, but we OD'd on those for sure.

My kebabs had a wonderful smoky, grilled flavor, the chicken was tender and the steak was cooked a perfect med rare.  My roasted potatoes were nice and tender and I proceeded to stuff myself with even more potatoes.  Roasted taters + Greek fries = carbo overload.  My plate also came with some nice sautéed veggies, squash, broccoli, carrots, onion.  Very tasty.

The salad that started the meal was crisp and full of wonderful Greek flavor as well.  

All in all we quite happily made complete pigs out of ourselves.  Everything was delicious, and after the slow start with the service, it was great after that, and a couple of other manager/owner types checked on us too.  I love that.

Then....oh yes there's more....we had just pushed back our chairs, were rubbing our full bellies, and here comes another owner/manager type offering us a sample of the new type of roasted potato they are going to offer.  

Oh Lordy.  I am wondering what kind of carb coma I'm going to end up in, but we tried them and they were delicious.  They created a sauce that blends the best of oregano, lemon, and I think white wine and I even think I spied a caper.  Wonderful.  

I want to go back today."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place :) I'm an extremely picky eater and the staff here is always polite and accommodating. The waitresses are super friendly and gorgeous!"}
{"text":"When I am absolutely carnivorous, I come here and I get the \"Aegean Club\"  It is next to impossible to finish.   Unless you are a tri-athlete, or some other high calorie consuming person.  I never finish it, but I still like it!  I get two meals out of it.  

However, if you don't want to gorge yourself, then I go for the \"Gyro,\" pronounced \"Hee-Roh,\" but roll the \"R\" like a spanish person would pronounce an \"R\".  Greeks laugh at people who say, \"Euro.\"  Although there aren't too many greeks who seem to work at this place.....as a matter of fact they didn't know what I was talking about when I said \"Hee-Roh,\"  But damn it, I am not going to say it wrong just for them.  They should have a basic greek terms for the employee who work here.  

Anyway, the lamb in both of these sandwiches is perfectly seasoned.  I haven't had a bad one yet.  This place is batting 1000 with me.  

BTW - If you are having a party there and want to make it festive, you can get one of the flaming cheeses which come out on fire with singing etc...."}
{"text":"A fun place to go with a group or a date!  Be sure to order something flaming cause that's a real treat.  The food is great, I love the gyro platter, and the gyro salad.  The portions are surprising, since if you get a large salad you would be amazed and their idea of \"large\".   The deserts are okay, but I haven't had many of them since by the time it comes around I am ready to be rolled out the door."}
{"text":"Terrific Happy Hour!
Went there with some girl friends and ordered the house Chardonnay for $3 a glass- very good and worth the money.  Also the pizza salad.  HUGE and excellent.  Made for a great lunch the next day too.  The chipotle humus is a must.
You simply need to try their pita bread.  It is the best."}
{"text":"place was very good. The food is good the service was amazing.  Flaming feta Opa!  Finished with the NY chocolate cake, so good. Advertises on http://www.restaurant.com/ Paid $27 after tip for $50 worth of food!"}
{"text":"Love greek food and if you want a great dining experience highly recommended.  Grab a coupon from http://www.restaurant.com/ and save a bundle.  

We headed out for an early birthday celebration this Saturday and had a great time. Food is top notch and I can't get enough of that gyro meat dipped in tzatziki, OPA!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch deals, great food, quick service."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food. I enjoyed the gyro platter with a side of rice and vegetables. One thing that could be improved is the pita bread portioning. Who in the world is only satisfied with three tiny slices of pita bread? Put some more bread on the plate. Then I will up this place's rating to four stars.

Until then, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is okay if you want smiling service and questionable portions."}
{"text":"You people are f-ing nuts.  This place could not be more Americanized and could not taste more like cafeteria food.  It looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is.  \"half off drinks!\" wow, that helps me figure out if this place serves good food or not.  Is Greek beer supposed to be warm and flat as well?  Service was terrible.  Food came out very fast, but it was cold which led me to believe it was sitting there, prepared ahead of time.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Just wanted to write another quick review about this awesome restaurant. My fiance and I returned to this location because the last time we were here the customer service was excellent and the food was fresh and delicious. We were impressed yet again when we returned last week to enjoy another meal. Thank you to Romy and your staff for always making us feel so welcome at your restaurant. :D"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite restaurant on Mill. I had never been to a Greek restaurant before today and I loved it. My friend got the village hummus here which was absolutely delicious. It comes with some delicious, warm pita bread. I'm definitely going back just to order it. I ordered the mushroom burger and it was HUGE but so good and the Greek salad it came with was also super yummy. We sat up and ate at the bar and the bartender was totally adorable and a sweetheart. I'm looking forward to eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"Of the many Calamari Salads I have tasted in various restaurants in various cities, I would have to say this place has the best tasting one. It is cooked just right with outside being crispy and yet the Calamari is never overcooked to the point that it becomes chewy.

The Falafel is also authentic with just the right amount of spices and seasoning. Again, the falafel is cooked to perfection.

The service is average to good, a bit on the slow side. The staff, once you get their attention will be prompt in getting you the things you need."}
{"text":"First, I went into this restaurant and noticed that the setup seems good. The meals were between $8.00 and $30.00 I believe. I ordered a Gyro wrap with fries. Though the service was polite, they delivered another table's meals to our table by mistake at first.
I later received my meal. When I did, it seemed like not a lot of food. The most of the food seemed to be the french fries. However, the lamb, etc within the gyro wrap had a good flavor, which I had enjoyed. I do think that it could have been more food though. But with my meal being on the lower end of the prices, I guess that I should not be surprised.
I don't usually eat Greek food, but my opinion is that maybe this restaurant is good for once in a while. They do have a cheaper lunch menu until 4pm."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my overall experience at the Arizona Center location. We had Yuridia as a server and she was friendly, recommended the AMAZING Grecian Delight pizza that I took her up on, and attentive. I was out with a friend and she didn't come and interrupt us a bunch while we were catching up. My only issue was that on my drinking glass there was some sort of sticky residue on the outside of it, as if a piece of tape might have been pulled off of it. I was thirsty and the inside looked fine, so I didn't say anything about it. I've never been to the Arizona Center before, but if I have the occasion to go again, I'd stop by."}
{"text":"We really like this particular MBFGR - more so than some of the others we've been to. The food seems to be better - and we're not sure why. The lamb chops in particular are really good. This time we had their platter for two with was on special ($10 off). Wow, 4 people would have been full. It had some of everything on it. The sides are quite good as well - my family in particular all like the lemon potatoes (my daughter has decided that's the best potato dish on earth). The rice and greek salads are great, and they do a good job with the grilled vegetables - just right so they are not too soggy or wilted."}
{"text":"When I'm working in Tempe, this is my go-to lunch spot.

Here's what I love:
* Fast
* Friendly staff
* Delicious (and cheap!) lunch specials

My personal favorite is the chicken caprese pita - filling, but not too much. I also love to splurge on saganaki every once in a while. Opa!"}
{"text":"This is one of those great little gems to go to at lunchtime. I've never had bad service, the food is good, the waitstaff friendly and the prices are right. Just all around a good place to go. And the sangria!  Try the red; the white is good but the red sangria is to die for.  If you're a sandwich person, try the Greek Club (not even sure that's the real name of the dish but you can't miss it).  A HUGE serving; two people can split it.  If you're near Tatum and Shea, head in for a great meal any time."}
{"text":"Wow - this used to be a really fun and tasty place to go - it's still pretty good, but it feels tired here.  The tables need refinishing (and better cleaning - my arms were sticking to the table).  The wait staff uniforms just looked less sharp than in the old days (and their performance kind of matched - in particular, a lady was pushing an older lady out in a wheelchair - I watched the hostess/manager walk in front of them and go behind the hostess station, then watched a waiter stop and watch, but nobody got up to open the door for them - I had to get up and walk about 30 feet to the front door to hold the door open - that's kind of an epic hospitality fail IMHO)

On to the food - still tasty - you can't go wrong with the Gyro Pita - greek salad or fries, either are very good.  Didn't get it tonight, but order the flaming Saganaki for an appetizer - everybody needs some Opa! in their day.

Wish the place was more like it used to be - hey BFGR - get your act back together!!"}
{"text":"Mmm... Greek Food.. (mouth watering)..

My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is AMAZING. They have managed to become an impressive chain! I've visited several of their locations throughout the Phoenix/Tempe/Avondale area and have never been proved wrong! As a Greek food estatic I am please to announce this chain will satisfy any Greek food lovers mouth! This place is not like other Greek food chains out there (Daphne's Greek Food). The restaurants always have a soothing design and the staff is quick to serve. I love this place! :) 

Four Stars!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing lunch deals. You can get a big, fat fluffy pita full of fresh vegetables and a side Greek salad for under $7.

Please please please come see Victoria at big fat Greek. She'll take care of you."}
{"text":"Excellent service as always!

Food is awesome too!

And they have a full bar. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This has a super cool patio overlooking some of the larger building downtown, but also the fountains and trees of the area.  The crowd was a mixture of youth (high school) and families the night I visited. Our server was ok, but seemed annoyed when we asked for things. The flaming cheese was worth the other issues.  Nom Nom Nom."}
{"text":"The Beef Souvlaki is by far the best thing on the menu, to me. I would actually recommend that if you're unsure of what to order, any of the Souvlaki options are sure bets."}
{"text":"Most people dislike this place because it is a chain.  I have been here in the past lets say a few years back and the service was horrible... that I do remember.  I also recall that I wasn't blown away by the food.  Yesterday I was craving Greek and thought I should give it another try. I came for lunch and the service was friendly and attentive.  The hummus was very good.  I also enjoyed my falafel pita... not the best I have ever had, but good.  So now that they seem to have improved their service issues I will definitely be back for lunch again sometime soon."}
{"text":"For the longest time I did not come here because the name was a little corny and I thought it would be expensive.  The food here for lunch is really cheap, $5, and it is really great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great laid back culture.  If you like big portions, big food at a great price give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Previous reviewers have compared this restaurant to Olive Garden and a \"Greek version of Denny's\".  That's about right.  I doubt anything was fresh, including the lettuce on our salad.  Save yourself the experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for lunch again yesterday.  Had a restaurant.com certificate to use.  So I had the Greek salad topped with gyros meat and my friend had the Greek Salad topped with grilled chicken.  Both of our salads were very good and tasty.  The portion size was also excellent, and I am a big eater.  

The prices are fair, but with the certificate, this lunch was a steal!  I like this place.  It is smaller than the other franchises but more cozy.  And both times we have been here, our servers were knowledgeable, attentive, and efficient.  Good establishment IMO!"}
{"text":"Actually, I would give them 3.5 stars -- went for lunch last week with my wife. She had the gyros lunch special with a side of Greek salad. I had the roasted lamb dinner with a side of Greek salad. Both meals were very good. My lamb dinner was flavorful and with the three sides and with the addition of the small Greek salad, there was plenty of food to fill me up. My wife's lunch came to about $8 and my dinner came to $20. But with a $10 off coupon that they advertise, we had a great meal for $18! Oh yeah, my wife had a coke for an additional $2.00 (I think) and I had a glass of so-called Greek Cabernet Sauvignon. The glass of wine cost me an additional $10 and it was pretty putrid. Maybe this statement is an over reaction on my part, but being the wine snob that I am, I really thought that it was bad. Worth maybe $4.50 a glass at best. But a decent place for a Greek meal if you ask me."}
{"text":"restaurant.com - bought a $25 gift certificate on sale for about $3.80....so I knew going in that I would be saving about $22. If you do have the restaurant.com coupon, there is a minimum you have to spend of $35 and that only applies to food. We found the best deal to be the MEAT LOVER'S PLATTER aka \"A SYMPOSIUM OF ECSTASY\". It was $18 per person so it came out almost perfectly to $36. 

The platter comes with chicken, pork, and beef souvlaki, mousaka, pastitsio & tzatziki, served with Greek salad for two, rice & roasted lemon potatoes.. And believe me when I say this is a HUGE platter. My gf and I finished about half of the platter and we were still sent home with 3 boxes of leftovers.

Since we don't eat pork, they were happy to substitute the pork for more gyro. The greek salad was a nice way to start of the meal, it was a moderately sized portion that whet your appetite and was full of crisp tomatoes and bitter olives. The gyro had to definitely be the highlight of the meat platter. It was tender, soft, flavorful and completely sent me into hibernation with the tzatziki sauce. The chicken was pretty decent also, could have been a little more moist.  

The lemon potatoes were more filler than flavor. And  I guess I'm not a mousaka or pastitsio fan....they must be an acquired taste but the consistency was borderline human flesh (based on assumptions) and tasted soggy blandish. I would have been happy only eating the meat portion of the platter.

The service was around average. It wasn't particularly busy this night, but I only had my water refilled once and we had finished eating for about 10 minutes before we could get a hold of ANY waiter. That being said, the waiter was still extremely friendly and helpful - just slow and inattentive. 

Overall, I would only eat here again for the gyro's."}
{"text":"We've gone to MY GREEK twice since it changed over. WE LOVE IT! We ordered the $40 family platter and it was GREAT! Our server was attentive and our food was cooked correctly! Salads were great and decor is lovely. A little understaffed since we've noticed people waiting at the door at times for the hostess to seat them. The bathroom decor does leave a tad to be desired, but its not like a Walmart of McDonald's bathroom like Jade is describing."}
{"text":"Tried this place out twice during lunch time while at a conference across the street. Had the gyro lunch plate one day...it was yummy! And at $7, it was a bargain. Had the pork souvlaki the next day...it was good, but not great. Meat was a little tough and cut up in big chunks. Fries were nice and crunchy. I would love to try the Meat Lovers Pizza and the Big Fat Greek Burger. Guess that means I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a lot multiple times in passing but just went earlier this week and I was pleasantly surprised!
We had a pretty big group (10 people) so we made a reservation ahead of time. The place was actually really empty, which wasn't too surprising since it was a Tuesday evening.
The host was very accommodating with people from our group arriving late and ordering at different times. Can't remember his name but he was so helpful and patient the entire time.
The menu selection is pretty big! There's lots of Greek choices like pita, falafel, and souvlaki, as well as a variety of more Americanized options like pizza, pasta, calzones, sandwiches, and burgers. I had the Big Fat Greek Burger and it was a huuuuge portion. Like multiple toppings such as tomatoes and feta, with a burger patty AND plenty of gyro meat, plus it came with fries! Sooo much food.
The portions of other food looked pretty big too; other members of my group got lamb chops, Florentine pizza, calzone (which is also really big!), pasta, Greek nachos, and they all really enjoyed the food!
Plus it was happy hour so they had specials like $3 drinks, $4-5 appetizers, $19 pitchers of sangria, and I think they had half off bottles of wine that day.
Basically, if you're craving Greek food (or pizza/pasta) in Tempe, My Big Fat Grewk Restaurant is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food made with high quality ingredients. Large portions. Service was friendly and helpful, explaining various items on the menu. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place (similarly to Kincaid's) was NOT made for crowds.  

Lunch took effin forever.  My gyro PITA LUNCH took well over an hour to come to the table.  Come on!  It's already cooked lamb!  All you have to do is slice it and put it in a pita.  It's more like assembly than real cooking at this point!

The key difference?  Well, we had additional time AND the waitress was nice and continued refilling drinks and the such.  Unlike Kincaid's.  

Would I come back?  The gyro was plentiful and I enjoyed it.  I'd probably try to wait out the crowd next time.  So the answer is, it depends."}
{"text":"My mother and I stopped in for their happy hour saganaki and it was delicious. And it was quick service and they were kind and just wow! Next we shared the prime rib French dip and it came out quick and since we told him we were sharing it the food came out on two plates with the same amount of food for the price of one! We were both really full and will love coming back here!"}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing Food. We choose to sit outside in December and it was just gorgeous. People walk by and cars drive by on a busy road, but it doesn't bother at all."}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were fair. The service was lacking, though. Our large party had to split our bills individually for business purposes. The waitress brought the checks to our table and literally held them out like a deck of cards for us to choose our own. When we paid, she simply laid all of our change and receipts in the books in a group on the table, not even attempting to hand them to the correct person. If you do go to this restaurant, use the bathroom beforehand as theirs are pretty gross."}
{"text":"Currently this location is CLOSED (Mill Avenue) due to the fire damage - still waiting impatiently for them to open up again, but there are other locations too and the food is about the same. I always stick with a basic gyro and Greek side salad. Can't go wrong with this."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, large portion sizes, great service, and reasonable prices.  All Big Fat Greeks are pretty much the same to me and I love them all.  I know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy, but I don't care.  I enjoy prompt service, large portions of good food, and consistency and this place delivers all 3."}
{"text":"After a long awaited visit to the Mill Ave. location, we arrived to see it had closed. I checked their web-site and it said nothing about the closure. Two years of looking forward to this visit! What a let down. Next time in Phoenix, we will go to another location. 
BFGR, please add the closure to your web-site! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun Greek place. The appetizer sampler is huge but tasty. I usually order the chicken and beef kabobs, and of course the spanakopita (spinach/cheese pies). This isn't your five star Greek place, but it's fun and still pretty good for the price. Be warned, bring your appetites! The portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"It's May 2012 & MBFGR has recently added to their menu.  The food at the Tatum/Shea location has always been delicious & the staff is especially personable with consistent, top-notch service.  So, when I ordered their new Feta Berry Salad I was confident it would be great.  But, OMG - this salad was heaven on a plate!  Crisp romaine & iceberg lettuces were generously topped with freshly sliced, big strawberries (yes, strawberries), candied walnuts & a strawberry-vinaigrette dressing that was phenomenal!!  This is an all-around great neighborhood hangout that has ample patio seating & a casual atmosphere that is always bustling with customers.  There's something for everyone here, especially now that they've added a sumptuous burger, a couple of new entrees, and two or more new salad choices.  If you haven't been to this location recently, do yourself a favor, stop in & have the Feta Berry salad & a few Mimosas, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan at all.  We went because kids eat free after 4pm.  They also have happy hour which made a combo hummus plate and a cocktail pretty reasonably priced.

For dinner I ordered what the waitress recommended... the spanikopita with roasted potatoes and sauteed vegetables.  The spanikopita was okay.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't go to the restaurant and pay $10 for it again.  The roasted potatoes were terrible.  A weird mushy texture and a funky lemon flavor.  I hated the the perfectly fresh vegetables had dry italian seasoning sprinkled on top.  Ick!"}
{"text":"I went here with a party of 8 last week.  This was my first trip to this location and it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  I think the Express in Tempe is bigger.  It doesn't matter though...I was just making a comment.

Anyway, for a chain of Greek joints, MBFGR churns out some pretty respectable Greek food.  And this location isn't any different.  I know its not the best or the most authentic, but it does the job.  Their servings are generous, prices reasonable and service excellent.

Even though I was in a party of 8, the service was very fast and friendly.  It helped that the place was not very busy at all for a Sunday evening.  We ordered 3 of those shared meat platter things and it was excellent.  There was more than enough food for 8 people with some to spare.  If you are going with a bunch of people and want to try something a bit different than this is the way to go.  You get a giant plate of Greek goodies for a reasonable price.

The only problem I have is with the calamari we ordered as an appetizer.  They give you like 7 pieces of calamari mixed with a ton of fried onion strings.  WTF.  It LOOKS like you are getting a decent amount of calamari but when you look closer it is more like a pile of onion stuff.  Lame."}
{"text":"Last Friday, my mom and I went to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant for dinner. Glad we ate there. The food was AMAZING!! The service was TOP NOTCH!! We had Mike as our server and is one of the best servers we've ever had in any restaurant. Ordered a sangria (Mike makes the BEST sangrias!!). For dinner, my mom ordered the Roasted Chicken Wrap. She said it was very good and flavorful. I ordered the Aegean Club which had bacon, chicken, gyro meat, and tzatziki sauce on a warm pita.  For dessert, we ordered the Baklava Cheesecake and wow it was very good!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and large portions for the money. One of my favorite places to eat at. The patio is awesome during the winter time. 

I recommend the Mousaka. That is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Very good food. Cheese cake is amazing, so make sure you save room for desert. The service was great. They have a few different beer options that are different than you can normally find but were surprisingly good. The coffees and latte were out of this world and the group I went with couldn't be happier with this place."}
{"text":"Man, these things are EVERYWHERE now. WHY?!? Oh right, its the huge crowds of people who are apparently in love with movie-to-restaurant spin-offs. What the hell is going on in this city? Are these things this popular everywhere?

Pretty much everything I've ever had is about the blandest Greek food I've ever had at prices that make me sad. The only exception is the Greek fries which you can get as a side to a pita sandwich and will get you through a lunch here if you are coerced into going.

This location probably though should have a 3 star rating or so because of its great spot and huge patio by the waterfall action in Arizona Center which draws in large lunching business groups like I am all too frequently in. However, the below average/average Greek food you get here just makes me angry that a better, more unique restaurant isn't taking advantage of this space."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the gyro pita and I thought it was a deal at $12 for a pita, fries, and a small greek salad.  The food was brought out promptly, and was well seasoned."}
{"text":"In all fairness, I went to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant with a large group and was offered a limited menu. However, regardless of the menu and size of the group, I think restaurants should prepare better food than I was served.

The setting is very nice - we sat outside near beautifully lit, tall trees. Though the evening was cool, the heaters kept us toasty warm.

We started with a selection of appetizers, including their famous flaming cheese, the presentation of which is a lot of fun. The tzatziki was fresh and light, the hummus was tasty and the brushetta was crisp. The disappointment came when entrees were served. We were served skewers of chicken and thinly sliced beef, both of which were salted to the point where we couldn't taste the meat. The vegetables were almost as salty, though I was able to get through them. I left my meat on the plate, making polite excuses for not eating it. The desserts obviously weren't made in-house, and were fine though nothing special.

In general, I was disappointed int he food I found in downtown Phoenix - this restaurant was no exception."}
{"text":"This visit reminded me why I don't eat at chain restaurants. 

I ordered the Angus beef souvlaki pita. It was just ok. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The to-go service was quick. 

I finished most of meal, but only because I was hungry. The beef was ok, but a little flavorless. The dressing for the salad was bottled and the tzatziki sauce was, as well.

When packaging this item to go, they should separate the bread from the juicy veggies and steak. The pita was a soggy mess when I got it back to my office, (right across the street), so I tossed it. 

If you don't mind a substandard salad made with iceberg lettuce and mealy pale tomatoes, then you might enjoy eating here. It is pretty standard for a chain restaurant.

Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Shrug."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is delicious. I went here tonight with my coworker since we were in town for a conference. It is within walking distance to the conference center and near lots of restaurants and a few shops. We ate outside with a beautiful view of fountains. 

I had the vegetarian moussaka, which came with rice and also veggies. The moussaka was great, it contains eggplant, potatoes, cheese, spinach, and sauce. It was really hot when it came out too. The rice is a yellow rice and has a few carrots in it. The veggies were carrots, broccoli and zucchini. It was really good. My friend had the caprese salad, which was pretty substantial. I thought it would be more like an appetizer but it was pretty big and filling, she really enjoyed it. I really wanted to try the baklava but the entrees were really filling and the prices are very affordable for dinner. 

The staff was nice, seemed very attentive. All the food that came out to the tables near us looked delicious. The waters we got with our order were huge too, they definitely make sure you stay hydrated in the dry heat of PHX. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're here at the convention center."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food in AZ!!! Coming from a family of foodies we are pretty picky. The flaming Saganaki is my favorite. Where else can you experience flaming cheese table side?! The ambiance is fun with a classic Greek flair. It has the perfect indoor/outdoor seating areas for any party size and occasion. If you have not tried this place it's a must! Ooooopha!!!!"}
{"text":"New ownership = small portion sizes of the \"pricey\" items like salmon and shrimp and poor service. Combine with the worn-out decor...not what it once was"}
{"text":"Loved the place.. the decor.. the atmosphere.. the waiter was a 5.. BUT.. and heres where I know I get picky.. Ive been to Greece.. the Greek Islands, too.. I just wish there were more authenticity to the menu .. THE entree menu.. gyros yes! Pasta???? What? I found the main menu to be more Italian than Greek.. with the exception of the appetizers.. which I adore.. I always get the greek platter.. with dolmades.. meatballs.. hummus, etc. YUM.. Not a fan of the flaming cheese doused in ouzo.. but thats just my own personal taste... Its presented wonderfully.. and flaming! Ooompah to that!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great. Had a great waiter. There was a smell in the restaurant that was not pleasant. 

Went to use facilities and they were not in good shape. A urine smell was also very noticeable in there too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden back from the road, along with a few others, and what appeared to be a deserted theater the night we were there. It was a Tuesday night, so the restaurant was pretty dead and quiet for the most part.

Our server was excellent. He was very attentive and friendly. When we asked to start with a hummus appetizer, he recommended that we opt for the happy hour special they were having for three samplers of hummus for the same price. This gets him a gold star in my book! Three hummus flavors for the price of one!

We ordered sangria, as well. It was decent, by no means the best I've ever had, but you do get around 2 to 2.5 glasses for $6 - a great value.

I ordered the gyro burger, sans gyro meat (lambs are for being cute, not for eating!).At this point, the tzatziki sauce was really what made it a \"Greek\" burger. The tzatiki sauce was good; the burger was just so-so, and that may be my fault for removing one of the main ingredients. My friend had the falafel sandwich, and enjoyed that.

We were also able to dine outside on their patio, which has fans. After being in a hotel in sub-zero temperatures all day, it felt nice to sit in 80-90 degree dry heat for a little bit. 

Overall, the food was pretty good, and it was nice to eat some Greek food on a trip, rather than the usual Mexican places."}
{"text":"This is by far the best My Big Fat Greek Restaurant location, and I've eaten at quite a few of them. I've eaten here about three or four times now, and the food and the service are always spot-on. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice, too-- it's a lot more upscale than some of the other locations I've been to, and I love that I see both families and couples enjoying their meals.

If you hadn't had it yet, you absolutely HAVE to try the baklava cheesecake. It's a million times better than anything you will get at the nearby Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few months ago while hanging out on Mill. It was incredible! Great food and the price is right. Got an appetizer and two meals for $25 so not bad for Mill Ave. 

We both got gyros with Greek fries. Super rich food but worth it."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Great location, great food, and great prices. I ordered the El Greco Calzone and it was massive and delicious. I seriously don't remember the last time I didn't finish all my food but this thing was huge. Between that and a drink my total check was less than $15 before tip. Thanks for fun experience and good grubbin."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food.  I brought a large group of 30 to eat lunch here a few weeks ago.  We enjoyed the beautiful patio.  The spanakopita was delicious!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place, what happened? SERVICE is slooooow, because they look understaffed. I still haven't seen a manager. I see the hostess running food,bussing tables, bar tending. 1 server having about six tables...where is the leadership these guys need help. I don't want to lose the love I have for this place."}
{"text":"food was good I would give it 3.5 stars, but the waitress was rude, rude , rude. to the point of just ignoring my partner."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at this lovely spot on Mill Avenue Thursday night. Hubby and I took his sister and mom to eat Greek as they were always wanting to try it. We went for HH and were greeted nicely and seated outside. Usually that would not be fun but we felt a cool breeze coming on and it turned out awesome. Kristina was our server and she was wonderful. We had the Mediterranian Crisp and Hummus Trio, both $4 and both delicious. The pita chips that were served with the hummus were hot and fresh. The crisp was tasty, we had ordered chicken to it for some protein and loved it. We all had beers and drinks and with the appetizers we were stuffed. All for less than $45 dollars! We'll definitely be back and you made Greek food lovers out of our family!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the philly gyro melt. Perfection!  The Greek salad was also very good. Calamari was perfectly crispy. The service was slow for lunch. They only had two waiters. All in all, pretty good food. Needs to improve on speed of service. If return and recommend."}
{"text":"I had lunch here a while ago and it was so medicore i forgot to give  them a medicore review food was average service was a touch below that and prices were out of balance w/the other two factors"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for yesterday's lunch at My Big Fat Greek. After looking forward to it for several days, as I had been to a restaurant with the same name at Arrowhead Towne Center and LOVED it. That's why I suggested it when my BFF & I were looking for a place to grab a bite before shopping. 
The restaurant was easy to find. The clean & spacious parking lot offered plenty of open parking spots. 
The larger-than-life menu to the left go the entrance was my first clue that it wasn't the same restaurant as what I was expecting. This menu was more expansive, offering burgers and pizzas as swell as traditional Greek cuisine. 
Upon entering the restaurant we were acknowledged, note- not greeted, by a woman asking how many in our party. As we passed the bar area, I did notice half-full glasses and dirty dishes/plates covered with napkins. Since my visit was at 11:30a.m. I surmise they were left from the night before. 
Dirty dishes invite pestilence & disease. Gross! 
The dining area was expansive and very authentically decorated. The Greek music that was playing was uncomfortably loud, but I liked the rhythm.  
The lady that seated us told us she wasn't our server, but would take our drink orders. We gave her our drink order. The glasses are humongous-at least 32oz! The hostess delivered the drinks without a word, although we would have liked to have ordered an appetizer at that time. 
After watching two employees standing around looking at their phones and chatting, I crossed the restaurant to ask that someone come take our order- of note- we were the only people in the restaurant. 
My daughter& I ordered the original hummus & pita appetizer from the hostess. 
The appetizer arrived quickly, again wordlessly, from the hostess again. 
My first impression was the scant amount of hummus in the bowl. It couldn't have been more than 1/2 cup. The pita was a decent serving size. 
The hummus was not good. My daughter and friend said it tasted like pickle juice. I didn't taste pickle, but I didn't like whatever flavor I did taste. The pita was unremarkable. 
A female server came to our table to take our meal order. My daughter & I ordered the chicken souvlaki with salad as our side. My friend ordered the souvlaki with sweet potato fries. 
Our meals arrived promptly  The portions were appropriate for a lunch order. The side salad Greek dressing was very bland. The only discernible flavor was oregano. Even the feta cheese didn't have a bite, as feta should. 
The pita bread was bland. The chicken in the pita bread was bland and unremarkable. The tztaziki sauce was tangy but didn't compensate for the overall poor quality of the food. 
The server returned to our table. In an incomprehensible falsetto voice, she asked a question that we had to ask her to repeat 3 times. After the 3rd time we gave up trying. We are not hard of hearing, but the high pitch of her voice, coupled with the speed of her speech made her impossible to understand. 
Greek food is my favorite cuisine.  This location is conveniently located; however, because of the substandard service, unclean areas and tasteless food, neither my friend, nor I will ever return or recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Always drop by this place when i'm in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed good meals in the past but my last big greek salad was a disappointment.  Only 1 olive and little if any feta cheese.  We mentioned this to our server but. \".... that's the way it is.\"  A $11 head of lettuce.   I will not order it again ...too bad it was one of my favorites.
 
I will be looking for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"What a letdown.

I was so excited to get a My Big Fat Greek Restaurant here in the Ahwatukee Foothills. I couldn't wait to try it--and then become a regular. I was going to be the \"Norm\" of this location. But, after one visit, I don't think I'll be back.

While this location shares the same name as the Chandler Fashion Center restaurant, it does not share the same recipes, menu, or, might I say, passion. I ordered the exact same thing I always get from the Chandler MBFGR, but this Ahwatukee version lacked in every way. The salad dressing wasn't the same spicy deliciousness I'm used to, and the chicken was dry and flavorless (unlike the Chandler restaurant's chicken, which is flavorful and juicy).

My dining companions' dishes were all similarly underwhelming--slightly off from the same dishes served at the Chandler location. None of us left satisfied. Unless this place changes and starts to focus on the quality and taste of the food they're serving, then this location is just a Kitchen Nightmares episode waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Observations from the other night:
  * The tzatziki was the best I've ever had!
  * The chicken in my pita was dry.
  * The gyro meat was pretty good.
  * The lemon potatoes were okay.
  * The salad was blah.
  * The service was friendly and helpful.

I'm rounding up from a 2.85 to 3 stars. I'll have to come back some time and give it another go though. Seems like this place could go either way (good or bad), and I want to be sure if I like it or not. Right now, I'm just not that sure."}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes. Just very bland, season less gyro meat. I sadly wasn't impressed.  If you are basing this place on portion sizes, it is a 5. However, I prefer taste to size of my plate.  I will stick to Zs Greek for my gyro."}
{"text":"Review is for lunch only - great lunch for the price. They are ever so quickly to get the food on the table once ordered. Ordered the gyro with a salad, which is an extra charge. Best bang for your buck at this joint."}
{"text":"A huge disappointment! The Greek salad was tasteless and no gets cheese on mine, clams were on spaghetti that was sitting in a puddle of clam water and flavor of the white wine and butter that was supposedly on it. Way overcooked, with never go again."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic, but a nice appetizer playe and good kebab dinner. The spanakopita was good and I love their keftedes. Everything else is standard fare. They used to have the fish roe dip, it was great but like most good things, it had to come to an end- though I don't know why."}
{"text":"The falafel here was a Big Fat Greek disappointment.  They were dry and flavorless and the pita lacked any real frills.

We were here with a large group which they accommodated quite well and our split checks did have a 18% auto grad on them. 

The menu has many meat free options, but I felt it was my duty to review every falafel in town, and at $7 with salad or fries it was one of the better values on the menu. My plate came with three large falafel patties inside a peta (its not pita here) with a side of taziki and a small \"Greek\" salad on the side. While the falafel was large, it was hard to eat with out breaking it up, and it was terribly dry and devoid of much flavor.

In summary go somewhere else unless you have a large group and need consistent mediocrity of a big chain."}
{"text":"Greek food in the midst of Tolleson and Glendale? Authentic ? NOT! Walked in here and quickly realized that we were the only customers at 7:30 PM. 
FOOD: 1 star
I have no idea what it was but it definitely was not Greek or Mediterranean of any kind. Throwing feta cheese on something does not make it Greek. And that was NOT souvlaki.
Service: friendly, semi attentive. I had to get up a couple of times for service, despite being the only patrons in the restaurant but overall out server was nice... Just busy multi tasking other functions I guess.

As the other reviews state, it's pretty much greekish fast food with a wine list. Definitely overpriced for what you get, even after the yelp check-in discount."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was very slow.  Ordering s salad took20 mins to get there.  The greek salad was slightly above average, the cheese and pita bread app was below average.  Presentation on the salad was good, the app not so much.

They did not have some items on the drink menu, and the waiter was annoyed when I said I did not want the substitute.

Would not return to this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Pitas and gyros are very reasonably priced! Try the \"Flaming Feta\" appetizer."}
{"text":"This is a must if you are looking for something a little different than the traditional american fare. My family and I went since we had a coupon and we heard good things. Well what we heard didn't do it justice since the food was hot, fresh, and mouth watering. We've been back many times and this is one of the places my kids choose for a special occasion and where my wife and I go for a great date night.

I strongly recommend the Greek Fries, Tyrokafteri and Lamb Souvlaki. I have had nothing that I can say I was dissappointed in but I will update if I do.

The prices are reasonable but I would say try to it out with a restaurant.com coupon if your not sure and go from there.

If you're not wooried about the coupon or price this is a must do for a nice evening out.

I doubt you'll be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I have been have multiple times and will keep coming back! The service here is outstanding! My daughter wanted to have a group of 30 join us for a special occasion and the staff was awesome! From the manager, who closed off a section of the patio just for us and confirmed our reservation, right down to the server (Mike I believe) were all amazing. Even with the larger group the food was hot and delicious not to mention the speed at which they served us. 

The food came out all within a couple minutes of each other which isn't easy considering the size of our party. If you have been to any of the My Big Fat Greek Restaurants you will be impressed by the service here. The size of this location is a little smaller than the one in Mesa but it has a more date or adult atmosphere, which is a nice change from the loud chain places.

The food here is fantastic!!! You must try the Greek Fries & the Tyrokafteri...

This is a great place and coupons from restaurant.com helps ease the cost if you bring a family."}
{"text":"The Gyro Wrap is quite tasty along with the salad and affordable for under $10. There is just enough food for my husband and I to share although I must say he hogs the wrap... The staff is very friendly as well. A good place to try for a good mix of decently priced and good tasting Greek foods. On the weekends they have the classic \"old Greek looking guy\" playing some tunes on his piano for your enjoyment as well."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We've been there at least four times and each time the service was very, very slow. Our last visit, today, will literally be our last visit. We were served by the manager, Brook. She took our order and then brought our food, but we never saw her again. We had to get another waitress to get drink refills and the check. Our waitress, the manager Brook, was standing at the register for 30 minutes. (We timed her). Tables around us were equally frustrated. The restaurant was not busy. The food overall is pretty good, but the service is so overpoweringly slow, it kills the experience."}
{"text":"I always look forward to dining here as I've been here a half dozen times now and it is always great! The restaurant is in a nice location, downtown Tempe where it is easy to find parking. Try the Gyro salad as it's the best I ever had, but then again, we've never had a bad meal here either. Everything we have tried here has been delicious. Service is fast and friendly. You can dine outdoors or indoors. Atmosphere is busy but not noisy. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves Greek food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would.  Waited over five minutes after being seated before being  acknowledged by the waiter.   After placing our drink and appetizer order we received our pita bread and drinks promptly and then....NOTHING!  Watched as the waiter walked around the outside patio where we were seated and never looked in our table's direction.  After twenty minutes, I guess the manager on duty saw me  looking around and came over  and asked if we had a problem.  I told him we wanted our check to leave beacause we had been waiting over 20 minutes to place an order.  The manager then brings over the check and walks away!  I take the check up to him and tell him we want to leave.  The best part is that the check is $8.67 and instead of taking care of it  the \"manager\" proceeds to tell me that he did not see any problems and had been out on the patio walking around.  This large mound is lucky I did not lay him out right there, and the whole time he is talking he is literally looking the opposite direction and won't make eye contact with me.  After running my credit card he hands me the receipt, still no eye contact, and walks away.  If you want crappy service ran by management that will not admit a simple mistake and apoligize then I would recommend this place.  If you want to be served food and enjoy yourself I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Recently there for the 2nd annual Origami Owl convention Grow 02.  We had our \"Pink Owls\" dinner here.  Loved the atmosphere, the food, and staff!  Perfect location, and the ambience was great.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic Greek experience."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Waited 10 minutes to order drinks. Ordered saganaki and cheese plate. They were both tasty. But, how could you screw them up?  Still didn't have silverware when apps came. Ordered horiatiki with gyro meat. The vegetables are supposed to be big chunks of tomatoes, cucumber, onion and olives. The vegetables were diced. Not good. Plus there was green and red pepper. Just not what was advertised. The gyro meat was cold. Just bland food. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Bummer. Trying to find good Greek food since Jim sold Crazy Jims."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch and ordered Greek Salad & Wood fried Salmon. Salad could have been better, and Salmon was so soft.. It was a nice lunch.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is within walking distance of my office and could easily be my \"go to\" place for lunch. The menu has a good variety and they serve quickly. It's a bit noisy outdoors so I opt for an indoor table where I can have a conversation with my lunch partners.

Yesterday I ordered a shrimp-salmon salad with dressing on the side and no red onions. The server was friendly and completed my order exactly the way I asked for it. My first bite of salad was GAK. I then proceeded to dissect the dish and found that in the lettuce mix they were using for the salad, one variety had spoiled. We're not talking wilted lettuce. I'm talking about slimy black leaves throughout the dish. I picked it apart so that I could show someone.

Unfortunately, the server didn't return. Later (40 minutes), the busboy came to take my dish and I said that I wanted to keep it to show it to someone. Then the manager came over and I explained that the lettuce appeared to have gone bad. He gave a nice apology but didn't offer to bring me a different dish. The bill arrived in the next few moments and had a $4 deduction. 

While I appreciate the effort, by bringing this to his attention, I no doubt allowed him to fix the problem for the remaining customers and probably saved him a few more $4 rebates. I think the place could be more generous with their service recovery.

They're off my list for a while."}
{"text":"The one star is for our cute and friendly waitress, and the saving grace of the place. She kept our drinks topped off and was very attentive. Her name has been omitted to protect the innocent.

The lack of 4 stars is for the food and atmosphere. The hubski and I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night- a night when The Keg, The Cheesecake Factory, and PF Changs would all have a line out the door. MBFGR was empty.
We sat outside to enjoy a nice Arizona May evening. We all ordered variations on their Pita sandwich. I had the chicken souvlaki with a cup of the avegolemono soup of the side. The hubski had the same with fries, and our friends had the chicken breast pita with Greek salad. They apparently go quite often and order the same thing. They were happy. Hubski was happy.
I, on the other hand, was not. 
I started with the soup, although it had come at the same time as my pita. The top was cold and the bottom was hot. There were thick chunks of what was formerly soup skin floating around in an unappetizing manner. What should have been a tasty and warm \"I'm sorry you had to fly 8 hours on a stinky plane and deal with lost luggage\" comfort food, was instead screaming at me, 

\"I've been left out all day! I am not fresh, and worse, I've been MICROWAVED!\"

I put the soup aside and picked up my pita. Pita is a stretch. It was not actually on a pita,but rather a flatbread. That would have been fine, but it was also cold. The grilled chicken inside? Also cold.

I ate it anyway as I was hungry and did not feel like complaining. It would have taken another 30 minutes for them to make me another. I am not big on wasting food. Oh right- they could have just nuked it soup- style.
I kept eating until I felt what seemed to be a bone in my mouth. Hmmm. Grilled chicken breast... bone? It was actually part of the burnt skewer that my chicken was cooked on. It was a little longer than an inch- longer than the actual cubes of chicken themselves.

I would have been done then, but our friend wanted to order desert. He wanted the chocolate cake, but it is no longer available. However, we were informed that we can purchase it at a local... bakery? Not quite. I won't mention the place because really, it was a secret anyway. Point being, not cooked on premises. Further point being, not cooked anywhere you would expect to pay $6.50 ish for a slice, whatever the size.

I won't be going back.

disclaimer:
After reading my review of Greekfest, you may think I just don't like Greek food. Quite the contrary. I love Greek food. That's why I am so particular when it comes to my galatabouriko being authentic and my souvlaki being served hot."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Greek food, I am always looking for something authentic, something skin to the Mediterranean Snack Bar where I grew up, burning my little fingers on the hot dish which held my often craved spinach casserole. I sat on tall chairs with my mother, my legs dangling as I looked around at the small restaurant. The meat on a spit, the bright blues and whites of the decor.
The Tempe location of MBFGR gets one more star than the Chandler location, but then my review of the Chandler location was damn near scathing, so that's not saying much.
To make an honest comparison, I ordered the same thing: the chicken souvlaki pita. This time I went with the side salad, which was full of bright colors and fresh looking. The food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty, if lukewarm. The service was friendly, even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas.
MBFGR just does not come close to my childhood memories, but then that was New York.
I agree with Melissa H. that everyone can find something that they like. The food is so Americanized. At least they could serve it hot.
If anyone has any authentic Greek suggestions...?"}
{"text":"Flaming cheese and hummus are the best. They have a fantastic happy hour but the dinners are alright. Go with friends for happy hour and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very tasty village salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, red onion, feta, olive oil and wine vinegar) with gyro meat.  Ample portions and good prices.  It was nice to sit outside on a lovely afternoon and not feel rushed.  Waitress was sweet and funny. High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.  Can't speak about the rest of the menu, since we were just there for salads at lunchtime.  I'd like to try some of the Greek wines they were advertising sometime.  The descriptions make them sound delicious."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the girl who packed up my to-go order. She put everything in separate containers just as I requested (especially the dressing!). Other than that Big Fat Greek would have gotten a measly one star... because no stars is not an option. When I was occasionally eating meat their gyro was dry and lacking in flavor. Now that I'm VEGAN they have very slim pickings for dinner options. The falafel was embarrassingly dry to the point of disintegrating upon contact. To add insult to injury, the warm falafel was placed on top of the lettuce and tomato which wilted and ruined the lettuce. The pita was extremely greasy. The other dish we ordered, the moussaka, was not terrible, but nothing special. It's difficult to ruin cooked vegetables. This is absolutely the worst Greek food I have EVER had. I was also surprised to find that their prices have gone up slightly from the to go menu I had. So you will be paying around a full dollar for your greasy pita."}
{"text":"This was horrible the smell and fumes of the toilet hit you as you opened the door. Then sitting for a. Hour and the order wasn't even taken .. Do Not Eat here"}
{"text":"For what's worth, I totally loved this place.  I'm sure Greek people find it insulting, but I totally loved it!  My gyros plate was awesome.  For $10.95, I got a plate full of meat, potatoes, rice and pita.  I was starving before dinner, so this dish left me more than satisfied.  What a deal."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this My Big Fat Greek Restaurant location.  My friend and I were in town for the Rock n Roll marathon this weekend and decided to eat here Friday night.  I've had some great Greek food locally and traveled to Greece a couple years ago... 

I won't say that this was on par with the food I had in Greece.  I will say it was pretty damn good for a chain.  We had the (regular) hummus appetizer and the pita was wonderful - soft, fluffy and totally satisfied my craving!  Oh yeah the hummus was good too.  

For the main dish I ordered a chicken pita with a greek salad and a pomegranate mojito, my friend was carbo loading for the marathon so he got some pasta and a raspberry mojito.  The mojitos rocked, though after tasting both, i have to say mine was much better.  My side salad was really good and I gobbled it up before I even touched my pita, when I did though - oh man!  Delish!  The Tzatziki was a little different... more of a blue cheese taste than I'm used to, but nothing that destroyed the overall taste of my food.  

Our waitress, Nicole, was EXCELLENT, some of the best service I've had in a long time and the atmosphere at night is great in the Phoenix Center.  No complaints whatsoever!  

Overall I was really impressed and would definitely come back to this location if I'm in downtown Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I have had to visit this place a few times with a group. The food is generally very dry and doesn't seem very fresh. Unfortunately, the reopening has not improved the food one bit."}
{"text":"Mediterranean pizza along with the shrimp  and salmon salad. Wow, this was a perfect meal for the two of us to split - along with a glass of chard wine. The salad was one of the best I have ever had. And the pizza had the greatest crust ever. Our waitress was fantastic. We definitely enjoyed everything about our dinner- and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service was alright, the decor ver tired and teh food was alright. I would eat here in a pinch, but would not seek it out."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our Saturday night dinner at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. This place has ample space on the patio along with strategic placement of the heat lamps. We opted to eat outside on a chilly evening while about 95% of the other diners where inside. So we basically had the gorgeous patio to ourselves and had a great time.

Our server was attentive, although a little too heavy on the upsells. My wife had the Pork Souvlaki which consisted of 2 skewers, house salad and rice. I sampled the skewers and can vouch that they tasted excellent. I had the Lamb Shank in what seemed to be cooked in a tomatoe type sauce along with sliced zucchini and squash with potatoes and a few pitas. I enjoyed my meal. Not the best tasting lamb I have ever had, but enough to get the job done. Our meal was about $40 before tip."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant stood out in a somewhat empty expansive parking lot on Christmas Eve. Nearby Rusconi's was unable to accommodate a party of 7 due to a high number of reservations so we decided to check out the much emptier MBFGR. There were a couple seated at a table and some other customers seated at the bar, so I definitely worried it would be subpar.

Since business was so light we were seated promptly upon arrival. However, service was not as quick as we would have expected since very few people came in after us. When they did serve us, though, the appetizer and entrees arrived at about the same time. Everything was characterized by a certain expectedness/predictability as well as daunting portion size. Most memorable for me was the braised lamb (very tender and savory in a tomato base) though the mousaka was not bad either. 

The fourth star goes to being open on a Christmas Eve, and to the bartender who put on dazzling performances of flaming shots."}
{"text":"I ordered the Aegean Club which features chicken breast and gyro meat. I bit into my sandwich and noticed that the chicken was raw in the middle. I immediately spit it out of course, but now I get to worry for the next 48 hours whether I will get food poisoning or not. I am also pregnant with twins and fear for their safety as well. Yes, they comped our meal, but the cook should have seen it and the expediter should have seen it. The sandwich is sliced into four slices, surely someone should have noticed. If you go here look before you eat this sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here last night not to try Greek food, but because I needed a burger within walking distance (the Hooters in the Arizona Center is currently being remodeled). I ordered mine to go because it was near closing time and I was pleasantly surprised.

I got the Bacon and Swiss Burger and it was very well made. The meat was cooked how I asked, the lettuce was crisp (even though it was the end of the night) and the fries tastes relatively fresh. The burger was a good size and I was given plenty of fries to go with it. 

I didn't even ask for it but they also included not one, but two to-go canisters of ketchup. I got the food quick as well and the staff were very friendly. 

I didn't stay but the seating looked very intimate, with tall booths separating customers and dark lighting. The customers were a mix of casual and dressy. So it has a broad range. 

A very positive experience. I really have no complaints."}
{"text":"LOVED it!! We have been to other locations but this is now our fave.  
friendly service especially Will he took great care of us.  the meat lovers platter for two was incredible and huge, can actually feed four with this!, tasty and fresh food, nice modern atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'd like to go ahead and update this to 5 stars. After returning to the restaurant and having another meal, especially after the owner reached out to me to come back, I have realized that they deserve their five stars. It's this kind of exceptional customer service that keeps them on the top of my list. Thank you, MBFG!"}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Restaraunt isn't the most authentic Greek place (or the cheapest) but the portions are extremely filling.   The main dining area is small, though cozy during slower hours.   

The service has always been very polite and professional.  The servers are knowledgeable about their menu and willing to recommend different items on the menu, depending on what you like.  The food ranges from Greek and Greek fusion to stuff that isn't really Greek at all so even people with narrower tastes should be able to find something they like.

Some entries are a bit pricey but the portions are large and tend to be very filling.   On this trip I got th Aegean Club Sandwich, which was a very satisfying fusion between a gyro and a club sandwich.   A great restaraunt for casual groups, Big Fat Greek Restaraunt's chief drawback seems to be that it might not be the best restaraunt for an intimate meal, particularly if you are looking for more authentic Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"All around, pretty good place!  The staff was incredibly friendly, they all greeted me heartily when I came in. My server - I think his name was Ben... was so polite, attentive and prompt.  I ordered a strawberry basil martini - with fresh muddled berries and basil leaves - it was very good.  For dinner I had the gyro platter with a Greek salad.  The salad was wonderful, the pita was perfect, and the gyro meat made the platter worth paying for.  I wasn't super impressed with the rice, it kind of reminds me of something you'd buy pre-seasoned and dehydrated in a packet at the grocery store... And it was a little mushy and over cooked... But not terrible by any means... Just not on par with everything else.  The potatoes weren't bad either, but just like the pilaf - a bit mushy and not seasoned subtly.  
The portion was huge, so I have a good bit leftover for lunch tomorrow (hooray!)... 
But I glanced at the desert menu and couldn't resist trying the baklava cheese cake (whuut?! ) - yeah, you read that right. I am so glad I did, it was so f@cking good.  So...f@cking...good.  So if nothing else - go for this and their other deserts that also looked amazing."}
{"text":"Our office dines out regularly for lunch and this place is on our weekly rotation.  The staff is stable and already knows our orders by memory and we love that.  They are very friendly and I have never found them hard to understand.  The manager always makes his rounds to see how the food was today and is very pleasant.  I did notice that when Tanger Outlets opened they had to hire additional staff almost overnight who were not as familiar with the menu as the other waitresses.  The food is always reliable and the sauces are to die for.  The flaming cheese is really cool and so is the hummus appetizer.  The pizza salad is awesome, two of us share it because it is so large.  We do like to change it up and their menu has plenty of choices for when we are feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"We had vegetarian spanokopita (spinach pie) and vegetarian moussaka. Both were excellent. Pretty deck but too cold out. Nice atmosphere. Lots of seating. Not fond of partially cooked squash, carrots and broccoli that came on side but potatoes great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! When we go here we always get the meat platter. This plate is huge. Put it this way there is plenty to share & you'll still have to take some home with you. We usually go as a family and I order it for two but it feeds our family of 6 granted two are babies and the other two are under 10.This last time we went we took a friend and her children wanting to ensure there was enough for everyone I ordered the platter x3 and some appetizers. Since it was happy hour we tried the greek meatballs, greek fries and introduced my friend to the hummus.Again plenty of food, Probably could have done with out the appetizers, but hey they were happy hour prices. My favorites on the meat platter are the lamb chops,chicken kabobs and the potatoes.. Yumm!!"}

Both times around 1pm and it was excellent both times! Great $5.95 lunch specials!! Both my friend, my husband and I ordered from this menu and we were totally satisfied! I ordered the chicken sandwich, plus cheddar cheese and a side of mayo with the Greek salad and it is huge and delicious, they have all you can eat soup and salad on the $5.95 and alot of other options:0) their Greek dressing is nice and creamy...so good... My son actually put some of their greek dressing on his chicken sandwich and loved it:0) the saganaki was good, but my friend thought it was a Lil salty, but I like a Lil salty so I loved it! The waiter and waitress that took care if us were good both tines and the place is clean and nice! I'm definitely happy I found this place! Plan on coming whenever my family & I get the craving!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Pastitsio and Spanikopita are friggin amazing.  We also got the lamb chops and they were out of this world.  Dolmades were really yummy too.  I've been in Phoenix for months and hate I didn't try here sooner."}
{"text":"We've gone to several MBFG locations in the valley, and this one was by far the worst we've seen.  We went on Saturday evening (1/25/14) and sat at a table in the lounge. We put in a drink order, which the server dropped at the bar, but the bartender (young, oblivious kid) was too busy chatting it up with a woman at the end of the bar to notice.  Eventually (10 minutes later), our server went behind the bar and poured our beers herself.  There were a couple of off-duty employees of the restaurant eating at the bar, and they were so obnoxious - very loud, shouting over the bar, using obscenities, etc.  Now really, I'm no prude, but we also don't want to listen to that over dinner!  At one point during the meal, a female employee (not our server) came by with a broom and dustpan and literally swept under our chairs while we were sitting there.  We were like ummmmm . . .  really?  Couldn't you wait until we were gone to do that?  Obviously that was her last duty before going home, and she just wanted to get out of there.  We couldn't believe how rude that was.  Who trains these people?  We do have to give props to our server, Nikki, who was awesome (and obviously quite embarrassed) throughout all of this.  She was very attentive, and brought our food and drinks as quickly as she was able to, given the state of some of her co-workers.  Incidentally, I had the calamari salad, which isn't as good as it used to be . . . they used to have the calamari in strips, and these were regular rings and bodies, not cooked crisp, and they were a little cold too.  My husband got the greek salad topped with gyro, which was delicious.  Needless to say, we will not be going back to this location, and we highly recommend that you drive the short distance to a different MBFG location as well."}
{"text":"Tonight was my last time that I will be going there. New management changed the rules for happy hour. There is no longer a reverse happy hour and skyy drinks are now taken off the list. When I called and asked about the reverse happy hour, I was treated as if the question were insane to ask (when I had previously been there). Additionally, going during regular happy hour, my friend and I ordered strictly happy hour offerings and were not told that Skyy drinks were no longer on there. When we asked the manager why we were not previously informed, we were told they no longer give happy hour menus."}
{"text":"For some reason, not every bar in town offers Sangria.  Enter My Big Fat Greek.  Sangria here is good and in fact, I got really drunk off some chocolate martinis there a few weeks ago too.  Nearly forgot about that.

Aside from booze, My Big Fat Greek has great food IMO.  I really like the chicken salad or the chicken pita.  The hummus is also always a great starter.  

I've always had attentive service and like the general Greek vibe I get when I eat here.  Casual atmosphere, great for lunch or for dinner.  Good location in Old Town next to many shops and bars.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good, sensibly priced, and healthy lunch options.  Goodbye to the heavy Kronos branded gyros of the food court.  One and a half opa's to this place."}
{"text":"I had visited the Tempe location before and thought I'd give this one a shot. I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita with a Greek salad. The chicken was hot and juicy, and the salad was also great. Kinda higher priced than I expected at $10, but the food was quality and the service was good. Not sure why it has a 3 star average, ill def be coming back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant! The Greek salads are great & my veggie wrap (served hot) was fantastic. My son had the lamb gyro, and said the meat was very flavorful. He was not able to finish the meat and my other son ate the doggy bag the next day & said it was great. The service was excellent. The only downside might  be the people outside on Mill St. were a bit seedy, but we never felt in danger"}
{"text":"OMPA

I want to start this review off on a positive note.  The staff at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant are friendly, accommodating, and engaging  without being intrusive. My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is the perfect place for large parties, the outside patios are spacious, perfect as the  summer nights start to cool off.

Today we were celebrating my Co-workers birthday.  She had the Greek Burger and my friend and I had the French Dip.  I can  honestly say that the food was ok, but not special. I would even say that the menu is a little overprized as most of the dishes are over 10 Dollars.  Maybe next time I will try a Greek dish a d see what that taste like."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great location (right in the heart of downtown), tasty food. I got a pizza, which was better than I expected (given it's a Greek restaurant, not Italian). My husband got one of the traditional Greek dishes--macaroni with ground beef. I didn't love the hummus we got as an appetizer. Kind of a weird flavor. I have high hummus expectations for Greek places. Other than that, great! We sat on the patio. They have lots of TVs!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. My date and I got the flaming cheese and a large appetizer platter and we were full! I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately at 7:00pm. We were surprised that on a Saturday night this place was dead. The place needs a huge make over.  It's old and needs updating. We were seated in a booth that had a hole in the vinyl seat. The service was good. The food wasn't. I had a Gyro pita and the meat was tough like it was sitting out all day, it probably was. My friend ordered the Pastitzio. It was cold and dry. He ordered more marinera sauce to douse the dryness. The only thing tasty on the menu was the Saganaki. I don't think we are coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"As one reviewer (Trent) said \"Overall, a good place for a decent lunch at a decent price.\"  We brought my wife here for a birthday lunch on a Friday at 1pm.  Just a few tables were occupied.  Nice environment with white table cloths, floors were clean and it was nicely decorated.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We all ordered pita sandwiches, nice fresh ingredients with a lot of chicken or beef and cheese and dressing, worth 3 1/2 stars.  They brought out a complementary slice of baklavah topped with whipped cream and a candle and 4 teaspoons.  Didn't have much taste to it but a nice thought.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch. Service is pretty quick. The beef and lamb gyro is really good. The Greek salad was a-ok."}
{"text":"I've seen these around for a while now.  Several locations.  Well, we ended up with a restaurant.com certificate for them.  So...time to try them out!

The service was reasonably good.  We were seated quickly, and a server showed up not long after.  

We started with appetizers.  There was a craving for calamari, and so some was ordered.  It was good, but I didn't like the dipping sauce.  I prefer the marinara used at Buca.  We also got the hummus variety bowls.  The hummus was really good.

For the main course we ordered gyro and souvlaki.  Both were very good.

The menu also features stuff I don't associate with Greek (like burgers and chicken parmesan), but either way it's a good variety of choices.

Next time we'll have the flaming cheese dessert.  :-)"}
{"text":"The rude service made me not want to eat anything at all. My boyfriend are while I just sat there with him. I've never been treated as terribly at a restaurant as I was here. It was my first time at any Greek restaurant and most definitely my last. We came in at 9. Tried ordering but was told they didn't have what we were planning to order. Had to look over the menu again and was rushed by our waitress because they close at 10. I will not suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I recently called to place a to-go order. A woman answered the phone and put me on hold... 15 minutes later I am still on hold. So I hung up and called back, it just kept ringing and ringing and no one ever answered. This was the middle of the week around 3pm. It's really a shame because I have never had any issues with this place in the past and used to go here a lot for lunch. Now I feel like I wont be back because of rude customer service and the fact that I felt like I was being ignored on purpose by lazy employees."}
{"text":"I don't think there are too many great, high quality restaurants on Mill, but this is definitely one of the better ones! I have been here a few times now; the service is always great, the food is always fresh and somewhat authentic tasting, and the environment is wonderful for intimate or large gatherings! I went today for lunch and ordered for starters a dish of Jalapeño Cilantro Hummus which was delicious and not spicy at all! Very creamy. On the lunch menu, I ordered a Gyro Pita with a side Greek salad which was also very good and the meat was tender. The dressing to me wasn't balsamic(y) or vinegar(y) (if those are even words?) for me. I usually like it a little more bitter and not so oily. The bill was about $15 which I found very reasonable being the hummus was $6! I would definitely recommend stopping here if you enjoy good Greek food and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Yes, the name is quite cheesy, but if you can get past that, you'll find some seriously good Greek food. I always order the Famous Gyro Dinner. It comes with rice, potato's, and the gyro meat with pita bread. The potato's are to die for. They are roasted with some type of lemon herb mixture, and the rice is as well. The pita bread is sooo tasty and fluffy and just amazing, and the gyro meat is fantastic...not too salty or dry. The spanikopita appetizer is delicious as well.The service is great too. Our waiter remembered us from our previous visit and joked around with us which is always nice. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The only reason for the 3 stars is the awesome service Brandon provided for us in the bar!  

We enjoyed the Greek salad last time so  decided to add chicken which was a disappointment because it was so dry!  I had really been looking forward to lunch here.  My husband liked his Parmesan bacon ranch sandwich alright but I didn't care for it.  

I think we will still go back at some point but maybe just for happy hour as we don't feel the quality of the food is on par with the higher price point."}
{"text":"Yes, the name is lame, but the food is good! Wow I just made 2 rhymes in 1 line. Hey that sorta rhymed too. Ok i'm done now.

But seriously, my boyfriend and I went here when we just passed by it randomly. I love Greek food and I thought everything here was pretty tasty. I can't really vouch for authenticity, but I had the gyros plate and it was better than Daphne's. My boyfriend had some sort of lemony chicken piccata type thing, which didn't seem very Greek, but he enjoyed it. The portions here are so huge! We both had to take left overs home. I wish I had saved room for some baklava. Oh well, next time. And I hope there is a next time when I'm in Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"I would give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant 4.5 stars if possible, but since I can't, I'm rounding up in this instance.

We frequent the location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona center. The outdoor patio seating is great, it has a nice view of the Arizona center plaza & park, with the calming sounds of the waterfalls right near the patio.

For starters, try the Greek fries. They serve a heft plate of french fries topped with a tart lemony sauce and cheeses (including feta). This app is delishhhh.

The Happy Hour (4-7pm) specials get my stamp of approval. They offer $3 large beers on tap, including some super good beers like Alaskan Amber. They're worth a visit just for their beer specials.

For the main courses, one of our favorite dishes is the pizza salad. You get a plate of warm, toasty pizza crust with a delicious salad thrown on top. The salad is dressed with feta cheese and a tasty balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It is very difficult for me to NOT order the pizza salad when I'm at MBFG restaurant.

Another good dish is the Vegetarian Mousaka (http://twitpic.com/46x9h ), however it can be a little bit sweet. The lemon potatoes and lemon rice are very tasty, if you're into lemon flavored sides. 

Give MBFG restaurant a try, even if it's just for their happy hour beers."}
{"text":"Almost every single time we go, we have a great experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant. Our latest trip (this past Saturday), was no exception.

Food was awesome, service was good and the overall experience was great.

Vegetarian recommendations: Greek Fries, Pizza Salad (so damn good), Vegetarian Moussaka, lemon potatoes & lemon rice."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I sit here because our waitress doesn't seem to remember we even exist anymore. Not her first offense. Call me a pretentious B- but I've been to Greece before and tasted real Greek. I know what a gyro is-- this waitress clearly did not. I asked if the Pita with chicken was a gyro and she said it wasn't, and then proceeded to explain to me everything inside the dish-- yep, it was a gyro. However, she decided to treat me like an imbecile anyway. Probably not her fault since the probably non-Greek owners labeled any gyros on the menu as just \"Pitas\" and think a gyro is only half beef, half lamb. After this little episode, I was hopeful that the food would make up for it. Spoiler--not in the least! Anyone who gave this place above 3 stars has clearly never had real Greek food.  Not your fault, I'm just saying there are way better and cheaper options in a bankrupt country across the sea. To top off our tolerant visit, we tried some baklava. Overpriced for a piece the size of chihuahua crap. Had similar taste too. So the food and service (thanks to Dora, our waitress) gave this place a single star. I would give it a zero and take stars away from other reviews if I could. Next time your hungry and near here, just go to McDonalds. You'll get better service and food for 1/20 the price. Thanks Dora."}
{"text":"Awful drinks. The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible. Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game."}
{"text":"I have tried other locations and I don't remember being impressed.
Coupons brought me here twice in the last few months.

First time it was for lunch and we ordered chicken and pork skewers. They were both good, meat was juicy and I like the lemony flavor of the potatoes and rice. The rice was super good.

Last night we went for dinner and the hostess and server were very friendly.
We ordered the salmon, gyro plate, and I ordered a pita sandwich with gyro, chicken and bacon. Name was Aegean club. It was really good, all very tasty, with lots of fries. The sandwich portion was huge, it was 2 whole pitas, and cut in quarters, with lettuce, tomato and tzatziki sauce.

We also had baklava, and it was fairly good. Not too sweet.

We ordered chipotle hummus and it was flavorful and spicy. The portion was reasonable and it came with pita and cucumber slices (I like the idea of cucumber).

I like their passion fruit tea

Cons
- Hummus comes with very few pita and cucumber (I think 4 each). We asked for some more pita and they brought a plate with a lot of pita, and they charged us for it : ( 
- All drinks are $3.00 (even coffee). I think $2.00 or less is very reasonable, but $3.00 is pricey for tea or a soft drink."}
{"text":"Service: Very friendly and efficient. Server brought me a to go cup with lid when I was close to leaving. Helpful and nice staff. 

Food: Very good. Doesn't have as big a selection as some traditional Greek restaurants but they have the favorites (souvlaki; gyro platters; various salads; several classic Greek desserts).Their gyro platter is much better than the norm. My favorite is souvlaki, though. You choose two types from among lamb, chicken, beef, etc. Their potatoes are great and veggies were fresh and not overcooked. Generous portions, too. 

A satisfying meal. For $20-$25 per person, you will be stuffed or have tasty leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a restaurant a one star review but this restaurant is special, and you know what I mean by that. I can quite honestly say that  they get the special honor of giving me the worst service I have had in ohhhh about a year. The server never once checked back on my after she took my order. I sat there by myself while she reapplied her lip gloss, talked to coworkers, sat at the bar and ate, etc. You get the idea. After waiting for 20 minutes to get my check, I finally walked up and went straight to the manager and asked for it and explained my situation. Did he offer ANYTHING to recompensed my time and frustration? Absolutely not, in fact when I got my change back they short changed me 15 cents. I mean at this point 15 cents was something I did not want that server to walk away with. I got a shrug and a sorry. It was one of those smug smiling type sorries. Sweety I worked as a waitress for 5 years I know what your smile means. I had to harness the inner ghetto part of me that wants to come out from time to time and walk out of there. 

It really is unfortunate that the manager chose to deal with the situation in that manner. I would never suggest this restaurant to anyone and their lack of service makes me completely not inclined to even address the quality of their food."}
{"text":"MBFGR is a very annoying chain of fake-Greek restaurants, and this is just another installment. If you like going to Chili's or TGI Fridays but you're in the mood for crappy souvlaki instead of crappy burgers, eat here."}
{"text":"Everything absolutely everything was outstanding. This is my new all time favorite place to go for outstanding Greek food!"}
{"text":"The service at MBGFR is simply fabulous. The waitresses are always on their best behavior and aim to please.  

I personally recommend the tzatziki as a starter, although I'd just as soon eat the pita by itself. I've never been given pita that wasn't fresh and scalding hot. 

Most of the menu allows you to add a Greek salad for $2. Other menu items allow you to substitute it in lieu of seasoned fries for no additional charge. Whatever the cost, I recommended getting the Greek salad with your meal. It is infinitely excellent. 

Personally I recommend the gyro wrap. 

And the Baklava is so good you'll want to pick it apart.

It's perfect for a light, healthy brunch."}
{"text":"I feel like a big fatty rolling out of here after I eat my weight in food. It's just that good! I'm a fan of all things Mediterranean and I've always been pleasantly surprised at how delicious MBFGR's food is. I particular like their hummus and gyros and I also really love their Greek french fries. Who doesn't enjoy a good flaming cheese!? I was especially surprised to realize how good their baklava was because I'm never a fan of baklava. However, they do something delicious to it and it made me a fan. This is definitely a good stop along the Mill Ave circuit and especially during happy hour when their pricing is practically a steal."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Authentic yummy Greek cuisine! We had a hummus dip sampler with pita, Greek pasta with mizhitra cheese and grilled salmon, gyro plate baklava and everything was delicious. Some vegetarian options to chose from. Prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere was great. Staff was not the best, service was not that helpful, below average, but the food was quick to come out. Don't have high expectations for service but I will go back because the food was great. Just be patient with the staff."}
{"text":"I love greek food so I was a bit bias.  But I feel like they have the most attractive girls who work here too.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The Greek country salad was actually pretty darn good.  The dressing was very tasty.  Lots of cucumbers,  some tomatoes,  onions, Greek olives and lots of good feta cheese.  The spicy hummus with cucumbers and pita was a great way to start our meal.  The Margarita with Sangria was not only good but the buzz was great.  The best part was I checked in and there was a coupon for $10.00 off at HH..  Glad we stopped here.  I will come back when I am in town.. On another note the service was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night. My dinner was quite good. I had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce. Service was ok.. Not great but not terrible. Giving a one star review however because my wife became very ill when we got home and she puked her guts out for a few hours. So yeah.. If you guys can make sure the gyro meat is cooked all the way that would be great."}
{"text":"I had the mussels and the gyro pita with salad everything was ok mussels had 5 unopened and practically every bite I bit into a broken shell good flavor though but not enough bread for the amount of mussels gyro and salad were good tzakiki sauce wasn't as good just missing something munchies around the corner has a better sauce should have went there now that I think about it good service clean restaurant and bar"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, enjoying lunch outside. You can't beat downtown Phoenix for a great big city experience."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. Had the hummus trio with chicken cucumber added plus a couple glasses of the house Cab - delicious!!!!  Also, had the Greek fries and could have done without them but they were still good."}
{"text":"The lunch gyro is always the way to go for me. The meat is very tender and delicious, and their fries are also very very good. Their cups are over sized so when you are paying $2 for an ice tea (like every where else) at least you don't feel completely ripped off here.

The service is always fairly quick, and there is not a seat in the house where you can not see a T.V, just incase there is a game on.

The only thing that was a little downer was how loud the music was. A group of us from work went there for lunch and WoW.... It was like being in a club. We have been there several times and not had this issue, but last Friday the had it cranked up."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy visiting My Big Fat Greek Restaurant every month or two.  It's a great restaurant whether for large groups, smaller gatherings, happy hours, or special occasions.  I went yesterday with a group of four.  Between the four of us, we got the dolmades, the three hummus dips with pita, a chicken souvlaki plate, and a chicken souvlaki pita.  Lo and behold, all four of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.  Though we didn't order the flaming cheese appetizers, it's always fun to say OPA with everyone else!  

Parking is pretty easy, there is usually a short wait time for food, and friendly service.  While the prices are pretty reasonable for dinner, the lunch specials are actually quite good.  I have been to several locations of My Big Fat Greek Restaurant though the location at Tatum and Shea is the one I've been to most often."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice environment and friendly staff but the food is terrible... I got the grecian pizza and my boyfriend got the award winning gyro platter and they were both gross. The pizza flavor was nasty and too heavily topped. The gyro was really greasy and the platter came with squash (???). The rice pilaf was off too. I also ordered a Strawberry lemonade and it tasted like it was from powder. Not genuine geek at all. Go the Greek restaurant at Tempe marketplace if you want good Greek."}
{"text":"Go here a lot and make it a dinner and movie stop. Service here is always terribly slow! Food is okay at beat but the horrible service ruins the food! Only go if you don't mind waiting forever!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food near Arizona State Campus. Amazing red lager on tap. Had the Souvlaki chicken skewers, they were really good. Sampler was good as well."}
{"text":"After the PF Chang Rock n Roll Half Marathon and the recovery potato chips and sweets, we were all dying for some clean protein and veggies. 

We had the mussels (very good!) and we all had the same dish - chicken something on a pita with greek salad.  

The greek salad dressing was disappointing -  greek salad should have oil and vinegar dressing and the dressing that was on our salads was kind of creamy, almost like a bottled caesar dressing.  

Service was un-notable and it seemed that our server must have been close to his break, as he brought the check while we were all still eating and picked up plates while one of us was still eating, so that she continued eating after our plates were cleared (this is a pet peave or mine)  

It was good...but have more character and authenticity..."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my FAVORITE restaurants in the area. The food is so flavorful, the portions are big and worth it. Like Carolyn H said, the meat lovers platter is awesome, and will leave you with leftovers for days..its 19/person but Well worth it. The service is awesome, the waiters are nice and attentive. We  went the other night and we were the last table there, and our waiter didnt make us feel rushed at all, he even gave us a 10% discount for being his last table of the night. My favorites are the meat lovers platter, the lamb chops, gyro meat, the grape leaves with lamb and the greek salad Really great establishment. If you havent tried it yet, get your butt over there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots!!  Have yet to have a meal I haven't loved!!  The chicken lemon soup  is incredible!  I pick it up any time I have had a hard day or I am feeling a little under the weather, better than chicken noodle!  I always have a hard time choosing what to order because it is all delicious.  The sampler of appetizers is great for a group, the flaming cheese is fun and delicious, the lemon potatoes, the Souvlaki, the hummus, the list goes on!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was just ok.  I got a gyro, and it was filling.  It was good but nothing special.  The service sucked.  I was in with a friend, and we were the ONLY people in the place.  I've waited tables, and I know you hold food so people have time to talk and get appetizers.  But seriously...we waited a half an hour.  And we specifically told the waitress we had one hour for lunch.  Not good.  Especially as there are a million other restaurants to chose from in the area..."}
{"text":"This place rocks! 

On vacation, I got lucky enough to eat here several times with one of my best friends. I learnerd that there is a new owner/manager, (a greek god) who is making this place fun and exciting, while giving excellent customer service.

Every dish was an awesome, mouth watering creation. The prices were great, and the drinks were perfect.

I will be eating here everytime I go to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here often for lunch and they have good lunch specials/prices. You get a lot of food so it's really a good value. I am obsessed with their Tzatziki Sauce and always have to request more. I recommend this place to anyone who likes greek food."}
{"text":"Lamb and chicken slovacki (sp?).  Wow was the lamb good.  Will go back just to have lamb.  Side of rice and veggies were really good too.  Could find nothing to grouse about.  Well done!

Hummus trio fantastic.  Extra pita, no hassle. 

Good service. 

Will return...."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack and a quick drink. I sat at the bar and took it all in. you can watch everyone walk be while at the bar. lots of fun. I had the flaming cheese and grape leaves. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Got the \"Award Winning Gyro Platter\" but I liked my boyfriend's \"Caprese Chicken Pita\" better. The garlic hummus had a little spicy kick to it which made me a bit sad (I don't dig spicy). Love that they served the pita warm. The service was awesome, even the bus boy checked on us and refilled our pita dish almost as soon as we cleared it. The fries with the pita were cold but they brought us out fresh ones. The outdoor seating was very comfortable even in the heat."}
{"text":"Gyros are delicious and price is very affordable during lunch hours. The fries or side salad ordered with entree are nicely portioned! Definitely going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences with the chains on east and west valley. So I came here with friends for convenience.

Not the best experience with the foods. Our hot foods were served cold... as if it's left on the kitchen counter long enough to cool down. One chicken dish was really cold inside the meat, with some pink color... we sent the food back to the kitchen twice.

The friendly manager tried to address our concerns. He took time to explain how the foods were prepared at the restaurant during the morning beforehand. Some of us get vouchers to return.

My friends returned there to use the voucher, with the same bad experience apparently.

Luckily I used mine at the chain in Avondale. No complaint there for me."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience in downtown chain earlier. This was definitely friendlier.

The foods was consistent as expected. No more no less. The service was not very consistent during shift change. There was confusion how to redeem a voucher.

Nothing to go Gaga about, at least no Poker Face here."}
{"text":"If the review was just based on the food I would give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant a 4 maybe 5. However, the service was just so terrible I had to downgrade to a 3. I don't mind waiting for a table on a busy night but it is frustrating to have to wait when you see many open tables and no one really moving quickly. Once we were seated we didn't see our waiter for 10-15 minutes when I finally went and spoke with the hostess. Eventually our waiter came and he was very apologetic but again after taking our drinks went missing again for another 10-15 minutes. This went on for the rest of the night....I don't know if this was an off night?I will say the hummus is better than anything you could make at home and the gyros are delicious. Just make sure to bring your patience"}
{"text":"Had big fat for lunch and it really surprised me how good it was. Our team went here for lunch and I ordered the chicken/shrimp soulvaki platter. The platter was well cooked and was well laid on skewers, it also had a smoky taste and sheeted with mouth watering sauce. I loved it!!!  Everyone else on the team also liked their food. I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the first time we have visited My Big Fat Greek Restaurant; 1/3/2014.  We were very impressed with the food.  Our server, Angelo, was professional, knowledgeable, a nice smile & personality.  He was very responsive & we felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Thank you, Angelo, for the great customer service & our compliments to the chef.  The food was wonderful!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Terrible, horrible no good service and less than mediocre food.
The place was not busy at all. There were only about 6 or 7 tables of customers in the whole place. 
The waitress never offered to give us refills and the food took soooo long to come.
After an hour of waiting and being ignored by our waitress, I asked the hostess if I could speak to the manager. She came back and said that she spoke with our server and our food would be out shortly. So, I asked her again if she would get the manager for me like I asked in the first place. I didn't ask her to talk to our server.
When our server finally came back to our table she apologized in a snarky way and said she got really busy, but like i said, the place was nearly empty.
The manager was nice enough and our food came out as he was talking to us, except for our pizza. The server said that she was still waiting on our pizza... after an hour! When it finally did come out, it was burnt on one side. The potatoes we ordered were extremely lemony and the vegetables were totally water logged and mushy.
I will never again eat here, even if someone paid me to."}
{"text":"Food was OK at best, the presentation of the food was great (food looked visually appealing) but the actual taste was kinda bland. The service was also lacking although there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Our food was excellent, French fries delicious. Waiter was attentive ,a great menu great people.A must try in Tempe."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try My Big Fat Greek Restaurant last night...everything we had was good and our experience was fine, but nothing about it (the food, atmosphere, decor, menu) was spectacular. Even if you don't like Greek food, the menu is large enough where everybody can find something they like.

We started with the flaming saganaki, which was delicious, but can you really mess up flaming cheese?  We also had the tyropita...it was just OK. We've had better at a dive Greek bakery just across from the Ohio State campus.  I tried the Athenian spaghetti for my entree...it was good, came with garlic bread (not that spectacular), and the portion size was just right.  Again, it was good, but not amazing. My husband had the \"El Greco\" calzone, which he said was OK.  It wasn't very crowded when we went in (about 8 pm on a Saturday night) and our waitress was nice and attentive without being annoying.

It's not a bad option if you are on Mill, but not sure I would make a special trip just to eat there."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here.  Another team lunch at work.  We figured we'd stick to something simple and known for the less adventurous in our group.

I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki dinner.  2 skewers of chicken with a nice lemony sauce on it.  Served with potatoes, veggies, rice and pita.  The chicken was good, maybe a tad on the dry side, but good flavor and the sauce helped the moisture factor.  The taters were dry and kinda tastless, I didn't enjoy them.  The veggies were gross, mushy zucchini (I guess my taste is changing though, because the last few times I've had zucchini I've not liked it no matter the way its cooked), the broccoli was okay... and I don't care for cauliflower.  Rice, kinda bland but not gross or anything.  The pita was the best part.  

My boss had the gyro lunch, he seemed to enjoy it but mentioned it was a little dry.

Monty had the falafel pita.  These falafel were retardedly big and round.  LOL, huge balls!  He had to cut one of them in half and take the other two out just to be able to eat it inside the pita.  Come one people, use your noodle here!  He said they were okay... just hard to eat and rediculously big.  He had to ask for tzaziki sauce because there was barely any sauce on the pita... hello!?!  

We also shared the hummus (spicy?), it was green and didn't seem to have any spice - or flavor for that matter.  It was gritty (should be smooth), and weirdly loose or watery?  Strange and not good.

I'm not sure about them but I walked away feeling glad this was on the company and not me. 

Daphne's might not be as nice inside but they sure have better food.  And the music isn't blaring."}
{"text":"I really don't know why my boyfriend and I decided to come here. Not our first visit to a MBFGR, so we knew what we were getting ourselves into, but for some reason we still committed to going again. (Why? I don't know!) The two of us came here for dinner on a weekday, so there was no wait for a table and the food came out pretty quickly. Our waitress was in-training, so she was accompanied by a more experienced waitress. Both ladies were friendly and seemed happy with their jobs. They were attentive but not overbearing, and we never felt rushed. 

MBFGR serves Americanized Greek food that is good but not great. We ordered a gyro plate and the moussaka. Both dishes were greasy, but the portions were large and the flavors were still good. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get, but it's not a very authentic experience and you do feel like you're sitting in a chain restaurant. I would recommend ordering a salad with a side of gyro, rather than ordering the gyro plate. The plate has too much greasy meat and not enough veggies - I left the restaurant with a stomachache (my fault for eating too much meat, but it was on my plate so I couldn't help it!!).

While this is a good place to take a picky eater, or someone new to Greek food, I prefer a more authentic, non-chain restaurant. Come here for Americanized Greek food, but if you want the real deal, do yourself a favor and go to a small Greek restaurant in the area. There are several Greek/Mediterranean places nearby that have much better food and don't give off the \"chain restaurant\" vibe. 

Service 5/5, food 3/5, ambiance 2/5. Parking is available behind the restaurant, but you'll have to pay (that's normal for any place on Mill Ave)."}
{"text":"I was feeling like Greek fries and Gyro my big fat restaurant didn't disappoint me."}
{"text":"ok, this isn't a reflection on the food. really, it's not. i've eaten at other locations, and the food is awesome. i just really dislike this location, and will never visit it again.

i came here to eat with a group of friends for someone's birthday. we were a large group, but hardly demanding - especially when you take into account that it was a pretty slow night in the restaurant. at the end of the night, after waiting 30 minutes post-meal and longer for the waitress to give us a correct bill, we finally received our bill and were shocked to see a 20% gratuity added to our bill... we checked the menu - it said 18% would be added for groups 8+. Ok, soooo .... where does that extra 2% come in???
we asked our waitress (who had never refilled our glasses, btw, and in general did not deserve a 20% tip....and i SWEAR i am not stingy with my tips!!!!). she said that that was how it always was, she just pressed buttons on the register. we showed her the menu, blah blah blah, she ends up grabbing her manager, who actually has to go look at the menu to verify.  he comes back to us and says that it is their usual policy with groups over 10. we very politely said, that that was fine, but they really needed to put that in their menu or tell parties that before-hand. i guess he ended up being nice about it, offered to take the 20% off. we let it go, since at this point, it was 45+ minutes post-meal, and we just wanted to go home. 

anyways. not really pleased with the shady extra tip stuff here, nor the service. will definitely NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I don't know what to make of this place.  I think people in Phoenix, especially in this area, have lost the common sense and therefore customer service gene.  On one hand, they asked our large party if we wanted to split our bills for each person.  Guess they're used to it with business parties and what not.  So that was cool.  Every single other person was a dickhead though.  Ah well. 

They get points for good tzatziki and pita.  I ordered pastitio.  WHY DO YOU MESS UP PERFECTLY GOOD PASTITIO WITH TOMATO SAUCE JUST NO NO NO NO!  No.  Ok?  Got it?  Good.  The gyro platter looked very good.  That's about it."}
{"text":"The Hostess Was A HUGE BITCH! The food was not terrible but I will never go back after how rude the night hostess is."}
{"text":"We have found this place to be really great, inexpensive and easy for take-out.  The Gyros are reliably tasty and the fries are outstanding.  This isn't a gourmet greek restaurant - it's the kind of Greek food we had in many Souvlaki Bars in Australia when I was growing up.  Yum!

We recently went to eat lunch in with the whole family and ordered garlic prawns followed by lamb Gyros.  Unfortunately there was a goof-up between the server and the kitchen and we ended up waiting a really long time for our food.  In the end we had to ask for it to go, but our server and the manager came over and were very apologetic.  The Manager ended up comping our whole meal! We definitely weren't raising hell over it and really appreciated the gesture.  When we arrived home, the meal was reliably delicious as always.

We'll be back for more great gyros!"}
{"text":"This used to be my husband and I's favorite restaurant for many years when the original owner owned it.  Every since then, it's gone through a series of different owners.  For some time, we swore this place off after the original owner left as the food quality was severely lacking.

The food has improved, but the prices have increased drastically and they no longer do a reasonable lunch special.  I ordered stuffed peppers and the peppers were stuffed but tiny, definitely not worth the $16 price.  It seems the food portions have gotten substantially smaller and the food prices have gone up considerably. 

The taste of the food isn't bad, but not worth the inflated price. We used to see a manger on the floor fairly frequently, but now it seems there is rarely/if ever a manager on the floor; service can also be hit or miss. We use to come here almost weekly, but have reduced our visits to maybe a couple times per year.  North Phoenix needs a reasonable/good quality Greek restaurant...Big Fat Greek is not cutting it!"}
{"text":"I love this place every dish is amazing. I go here at least once a month. The food is always fresh and authentic. Staff is always friendly and on top of there game. And there flaming Greek cheese is crazy good."}
{"text":"The people are nice, the food is good. The calamari appetizer is great, the gyro is good, the shrimp is good. Some of the reviews are just not so..."}
{"text":"Wonderful falafel pita wrap. Fast and friendly service, even during the Friday night dinner rush. The waitress was very attentive to my vegetarian diet, which was nice. The falafel was crispy and the pita was warm. Someone in my party had the beef, which was flavorful and very good."}
{"text":"IDK... the flaming feta isn't as good here as the Chandler locations... just feta, tomatoes & chilies... bland :("}
{"text":"Solid Restaurant with a professional and polite staff. While there are a lot of places to eat on Mill Avenue the fact is that most places are geared up for a student guest. I'm not a student but enjoy  the atmosphere therefore My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is a perfect blend."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Obviously it's a chain so the experience is pretty much the same everywhere. My biggest complaint is that everything tastes really fatty and greasy. The appeal of Greek and Mediterranean good in general is that it is fresh and light. My gyro felt heavy on my stomach for hours. It's alright but I would say to try somewhere else if you are looking for something lighter."}
{"text":"Please keep in mind while reading this review that I am a complete wimp when it comes to spicy food.  

I enjoy felafels and have gone around trying them at various restaurants in Arizona. The felafel meat they serve here, is not that bad compared to several other places.  However, I can still tell it came from a box as the waitress confirmed.  And it was too spicy for me.

One of my favorite foods in the world is Tzatziki sauce because it's so cool and soothing with that delicate taste of cucumber.  Today I found out it's the American style Tzatziki sauce I like and not the salty authentic Greek kind because it was, yes you guessed it... too spicy.  Maybe it's the same for the hummus because it had such a zing to it, it burnt my tongue.  It tasted like spicy chunky ketchup with lots of ascorbic acid added to it.  But, hey... this is America.  I don't like the Mexican food down in Mexico either.

The decor was nice.  I liked the dark blue ceiling with white fans and all the Greek looking details they added in throughout the restaurant.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Located right downtown this is a great place to pick up lunch or dine in. Right off the bat, they serve you a ginormous water, which is helpful in staying hydrated in 120 degrees.  The Greek salads are always fresh, never any dreaded brown lettuce.  They use a nice creamy Greek dressing.  The chicken  Souvlaki pita has nicely marinated, tender chicken breast slices which marries perfectly with the cucumber yogurt sauce.  I have had their Greek fries and martinis when they were in Tucson and neither disappointed.  More places should serve french fries with feta.  Service is quick, which is also appreciated.    Next time I seriously need to get my OPA on and get the flaming sagnaki cheese.  

Their gyro meat is craved right off the spicket and not from a gross freezer pack.  

Disclaimer:  I'm from Michigan where there is more Greek Coney Island Restaurants on the corner than chain pharmacies, so this is like an oasis in the desert.  We also have a killer Greek Town in Downtown Detroit.  While they don't have Scordalia it will do."}
{"text":"My mom and I are regulars at this location and tonight was just horrible. We love the greek cobb salad and we both ordered it but had some specifications for each one. Both came wrong. They took them back to fix it and it looked like stuff was thrown off the one and put on the other. The waitress came over and asked us what was wrong and we told her it looked like things were just thrown on it. She offered to remake them. We said okay. After 20 min we got our salads and the chicken and pita that are normally warm were cold like they were from the other salads. The manager came over 15 min later and acted like we were lying. She brought hot meat (which was not even the right kind) and said she saw them remake it which was a lie. We go in there at least 3 to 4 times a month but they will never see us again. The manager didn't even apologize and acted like we inconvenienced her to come to our table."}
{"text":"My husband and I are still looking for a GREAT Greek place. 

We went to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant on a Saturday night.  It wasn't very crowded and so we were seated right away.  The waiter did a good job, and I really did enjoy the service.  They also had a good selection of beer on tap.  The food was okay - no great. 

We started the meal with the humus sampler.  Although the humus was good, there were not enough pitas on the plate.  We were charged for extra. My husband ordered an assortment of gyro meat and I got the Greek salad with chicken.  The food on my husband's plate did not look all that fresh.  It was good, but I've had better.  My salad was okay.  We probably won't eat here again, but we enjoyed our one meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! The beef skewers and lamb chops were the best I've EVER had..we ordered the \"meat lover\" platter and it was so much food! Everything delicious,plus plenty to take home.  Our server Joe was extremely professional and made sure our experience was a delight..if ur ever on mill ave check this place out...great all around"}
{"text":"If there were a rating for NO STARS this place earned it!!!! I have been to this location before and the food was good. However, I came in on a Saturday afternoon and it was a complete 360! The lemon chicken soup lacked lemon and chicken. I swear the meat was pulverized and it was loaded with carrots. I ordered spinakapeta it was burned on the outside and COLD inside. Have no idea how that happens. I was extremely disappointed with the food and the service and won't be back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I did carry out at the Crossroads location and the hot gyro was packed in the same container as the salad.  In addition, the gyro was dry and the lettuce was glassy.  It was a complete waste of money and I will not return there.  On the positive side, the two guys who helped me were extremely nice."}
{"text":"We stopped in this location having never been to a Big Fat Greek Restaurant. The place was empty at 3pm on a Thursday. Our server was inattentive and spent most of our visit chatting with a coworker at a booth. We waited over 20 minutes from the time she took away our empty plates til she brought our check. The server seemed annoyed we were even there. We were one of two couples in the entire restaurant. I normally don't complain about service, however this visit will be my last."}
{"text":"I keep coming to this restaurant to be disappointed by mediocre food, mediocre service and mediocre ambiance.  There are too many fabulous restaurants out there to choose this one again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing to say the least. 
It's been a long time since I've been to this particular location. Happy Hour appetizers are not recommended. While I understand portion control - the calamari portion was so small as to make it not even worth ordering. 
The restaurant was very slow this evening, and yet the staff seemed very mildly engaged or interested in their duties. The overall vibe and experience was not great and not worth a return."}
{"text":"as of 9/25/14 this restaurant and their new one on gilbert road is closed."}
{"text":"Food is good. We do take out from there a lot. Enjoy the Gyro platter with the lemon flavored rice .
The saganaki was a bit of a disapointment and over priced, but the calamari was excellent and great value for the price. 
The chocolate cake was tasty but again a bit high priced"}
{"text":"Went with some girlfriends to try Happy Hour, our server was Nico, and ladies he was good eye candy!   My friend treated us to some drinks and appetizers, I never really know what to order when it comes to well drinks, so I just got a vodka and cranberry, that my dears was a strong drink, told my friend that, she told Nico, and he laughed and said oh most complain it's too weak not too strong  it was funny, he fixed my drink and then it was perfect!

The appetizers ordered where Flaming Saganaki, Hummus Trio, Greek Sliders & some Greek Nachos

The hummus trio had traditional hummus; garlic hummus & smoked chipotle hummus, all of them where good & the pitas served with it were so dang fresh! I love hummus, I really liked the garlic hummus, it was a perfect blend of garlic, not to overwhelming, the smoked chipotle tasted like bacon to me and that threw me off, but I think it was me not the hummus, little bit of allergies making my taste buds wacky.

The Greek Sliders where on a roll that had onion rings on the bottom, gyro meat and a melted cheese, ok these were delish! And disappeared pretty fast!

The Greek Nachos was tortilla chips covered in a melted cheese, but not like a nacho cheese, it was lighter, and had like a chopped Greek salad on top of the chips with fresh sliced jalapenos, This was heaven, who would have thought, the fresh greens with the chips, omg delish!!! 

The Flaming Saganaki was the most impressive on presentation wise, it was a slice of cheese set on fire, pretty darn cool for a Wednesday night I say! It also was served with some fresh pita breads as well.  The cheese seemed to have a little coat of flour on it and it was a salty cheese but went well with the bread, never had the cheese before and though it to be maybe goat cheese but found out the name of the cheese is kefalograviera cheese (damn I'm in trouble if I ever go to a cheese shop to get me some, my theory if I can't pronounce it, I shouldn't be eating it haha) and it's a sheep cheese, well I can honestly say it was my 1st sheep cheese! 

Service was great, company was awesome, and I could see me coming back!"}
{"text":"Kids eat FREE everyday!!! Food and Service is ok.  It is just way too salty.  But it is a nice change from the other chains in the area."}
{"text":"The fly plus the worst Greek food and service I have ever had..... This place was straight up awful. Thank god they served wine out of a bottle they bought from an outside company....."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, not the best I've ever had but not the worst. The flaming cheese is always a fun treat. A friend ordered a calzone and it turned out to be my favorite thing I've ever tried there. Their service tends to be slow, so don't think this is a good place to grab a quick sit down lunch!"}
{"text":"The Agaen Club is by far the best thing on the menu.  Try it once and you'll be hooked.  Can't go wrong with chicken, pita meat, and bacon all on pita bread.  Ask for extra tzatziki sauce.  Fries are really good also.  Drinks are huge!"}
{"text":"Love this place...  Actually, I have eaten at the Tempe location too.  YUM!  The Chicken Souvlaki Pita and with Greek Fries is my favie!!!!  

You need to get the Flaming Saganaki at least one of your visits.  It is fun and good to eat.  OPA!"}
{"text":"Great food here and a good location but they don't serve enough pita with the hummus sampler platter (4 hummuses) and it took a long time to get our extra pita (which wasn't enough either).

The ribeye is really tasty.
The shawarma is plentiful and delicious.
Their lemon red potatoes are really great!
I had their red ale beer which was really good."}
{"text":"Visitng friends in Mesa we all decided to try something we couldn't get in Atlanta.  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant did not disappoint.

For starters we had the Flaming Feta, which aside from the fact that it's a dish that's served on fire was very tasty.

The El Greco Calzone was huge but fantastically good and I was so disappointed I couldn't finish it there.  Your stomach says you're full but your tongue wants more.  

My boyfriend enjoyed the gyro and we took mad leftovers to the hotel.

Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to go back, but I'll definitely remember this for next time."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Chicken skewers are my favorite, but their hummus is legit as well. We've used them for catering also, very affordable especially with how quality the food is. They will remain in the lunch rotation as a go to spot. If you like greek food, look no further."}
{"text":"By far, the worst Greek food that I have ever had.  Granted my experiences are based mostly in Chicago (as well as Greece, NYC, etc.) but still!

I ordered spicy hummus as an appetizer.  It was neither spicy nor that great of hummus.  It was the second course that made me realize that I was in for a bad meal.  My greek salad was an iceberg lettuce with some feta cheese on top.  It did not taste like a greek salad to me.  My entree, shrimp with vegetable skewers tasted really bland.  

I did enjoy sitting al fresco facing the fountain.  It was the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"Love the food, service is mixed.  We were promptly greeted, it seemed busy for  a Sunday night.  Once we got our drinks however and stated we needed a few minutes, one was two, two was three, three was fifteen minutes later so that was a little annoying.  I wanted something new so I ordered the Athenian sphagetti and I added gyo meat with it and had their salad.  We also ordered the hummus trio.  The food was awesome.  My spaghetti was great and I'm not much of a pasta person but my choice with the add on was perfect.  I think if the place hadn't been so unexpectedly busy on a Sunday the service would have been a bit quicker.  I won't hold it agaisnt them as it is hard to find a greek food place open on Sunday.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. I'm visiting in the area and this place was convenient, so I ate here twice in one week. The service was great, both times consistent and friendly. The music is authentic and they have a cozy lit up patio. The gyro platter was ok. Also tried the pasticio and it had too much cinnamon, not my taste at all (but maybe that's what it's supposed to be). Overall, I would eat here again but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Yummy and excellent service! I had the gyro! I was glad I chose them. I'd definitely tell recommend this restaurant! :-)"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. I enjoyed the food, the ambiance and the flaming dishes!!! We dined outside and it was so beautiful under the moon and the flowers smelled really nice.

The only thing was, I didn't know what we were having (my cousin told us it was a surprise!) so when the waiter came with the appetizer (Saganaki flambe) and we were busy talking and taking pictures, I was taken by surprise with something going aflame!!! I thought something caught fire!!! I was scared! haha.

It was amazing =p I would prefer it if I can it with the flames still burning though. It would be more fun! haha!

So we ate the appetizer...I didn't know what it was at first because of the dim lights (we were under the infrared lamp) but it was Greek cheese pan fried with brandy and we ate it with pita. It was a bit salty like all cheeses but it was delicious =)

The next one was the Gyro platter. It had spiral thin sliced meat made from a mixture of beef and lamb, a side of roasted vegetables and a creamy sauce (tzatziki) with potatoes. Well I pretty much liked it =p it was good with the pita and rice =)

For the finale we had a flaming dessert. galaktobouriko. This time we saw the whole thing! It was amazing! I wonder what they drizzle after they set it on fire??? Anyway, the dessert was really good and looked delicious too!!! It tasted like custard (with bit more grainy texture to it) with vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with caramel sauce.

It was really nice coming to such a place once in a while and enjoying your meal with family alfresco style. =)"}
{"text":"Great little Greek gem on Mill! Been here dozens of times and decided it deserves a review. This has become one of my favorite dining spots in Phoenix -- mainly because I love Greek food and you can't beat the location.  The grape leaves, lamb skewers and hummus were both delish!   

Still thinking about the amazing french fries and fresh Greek salad!  Portions are VERY generous and prices are reasonable.

I've been here quite a bit and the staff have always been attentive and welcoming. 

Excellent food, service, atmosphere (outdoor patio-- sometimes with live music!).  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I am torn between 1.5 and 2 stars.  The 2 stars are mostly in credit of the potential--fantastic menu, decent wine selection, could be good atmosphere.  My experience, however, left a lot to be desired.  

It was my first time there and I was impressed with the large selection on the menu and the discovery of one of my favorite wines (Red Guitar) available by the glass.

The Monday evening was downhill from that first glance at the menu.

I sat for at least 10 minutes before I caught the eye of the manager, who then sent my server over to give me water and take my drink order.  The service continued to be very lackluster throughout the night.  The restaurant was very slow on this weeknight, yet we could never find our server.  She seemed to be absent even when she was standing at our table.  Several requests (an item that came out wrong and needed to be corrected, asking for extra pitas) took a shockingly long time to fulfill.

The sundried tomato hummus appetizer just didn't taste right, and the stuffed pepper dish that we got was not at all what I anticipated -- too rich and sweet for my taste.  

I was very disappointed with the evening, and won't be able to justify going there again."}
{"text":"This place should be called \"My big fat ass after I ate here\"  
Drinks are served in plastic cups the size of big gulps and the plates are huge.  All entrees come with boiled potatoes, rice and steamed veggies. All are a touch soggy, overcooked and heavily salted for taste.  Typical mass produced side dishes that have no individual care put into them but are surprisingly done OK. 
I had a Huge portion of Moussaka and it was pretty decent with stacks of potatoes, eggplant and summer squash bathed in a  tomato sauce with plenty of diced onions and peppers all covered in a parm encrusted bechamel sauce.  
Conclusion? Lots of so so food for the money. Probably will not come back except for the baklava which was delicious.  If you're in the AZ center for lunch, go to 1130 the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not really an exceptional experience. Basics were there but no great Greek food. More of a chain greek. Service was slow and not really present. Had to seek them out. Price was ok."}
{"text":"Our server, Kate was excellent. Very friendly, attentive, intelligent and prompt. We had the saganaki cheese, greek fries and falafel. All very good. Even on a crowded day, the service was perfect. Will go back again. Ask for Kate."}
{"text":"I am updating my review.

After I wrote my last review I got an e-mail from the manager at the restaurant saying he was sorry that my service was so bad and asked me to call him because he had some questions.
He left his Cell phone number and I called.

He was a nice guy and asked me to give his place another chance. Then he said he was going to send me a $25 gift certificate so I could use it when I came back in.

Well a week went buy and I cat a call from someone at the restaurant that said the manager had misplaced my address and they needed it to send me the gift certificate. I gave it to them again.

It has been 2 months since then and I never got the certificate. I did go back into the same place for happy hour and the service was average.

I had a friend suggest that we go to My Big Gat Greek Restaurant express on Kyreene and Warner  so we did. The place wasn't as nice but the food and service rocked.

Now don't take this wrong. I wrote in my first review that I would give the place another try, and I did. I never asked for anything but what I paid for but when the manager offers you a free meal and you are told a couple of times that you are going to get it and it never shows up. I consider that not being able to deliver what you promise."}
{"text":"Ugh!

First, a lack of creativity/originality on the name of the place.  Puh-leeze!

Then, I wasn't sure what to order because none of my colleagues had been here before.  So, I thought I'd go safe and order chicken alfredo topped with feta cheese and accompanied with slices of garlic bread.

Stupid me, I should have stopped the minute I had my first bite.  It tasted odd.  I thought it must've been because of the feta cheese.  I just had my first taste of (flamed) feta cheese minutes before that a friend ordered as an appetizer.

Immediately after I had my fill of dinner, my stomach cramped.  blank! blank! blank!

As a result, I was up that following morning at 5am, throwing up...for 12 hours!  Yep, food poisoning!  To be sick in a strange city is not comforting!

Ugh!  I should have trusted my instinct and dined elsewhere.

Like I said...ugh!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Greek food. There are some amazing places in Scottsdale and Phoenix. I saw the reviews weren't great here but it's close to work so I decided to try it. It was so so. The dressing does not taste like any of the Greek dressing I love at my favorite Greek restaurants. I wanted half gyro half chicken and the waitress said you have to pick one. Now at the 2 other Greek restaurants where I am a regular they do anything you want and they charge $2.00. Here they won't do it and they charge $4.00. The people who work there are very nice but it is definitely not up to par with any of the places I have come to love."}
{"text":"I adore, love, crave, & dream about good Greek food. 
That being said, I just don't enjoy My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. (And I really hate when people just call it My Big Fat..how appetizing is that??)

My biggest problem is with the pita. I mean, really, you're a Greek restaurant, you should at the VERY least have good pitas. They taste straight out of the store-bought bag. After that, there really is no redemption.

The menu is very chain standard, and is good for families with kids and big groups. It's definitely good for people with big appetites because their portion sizes are out of control.

There are better restaurants in the area for sure, even better restaurants right there in the AZ Center."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY NOT RETURN
It is no coincidence why I have never seen anyone in this place. 

You would think a restaurant on mill avenue (the most densely populated street in tempe) would have a high standard for customer service. 

As you can see I previously came here I even reviewed it, came back hoping for the same experience, experienced the opposite. 

THIS TIME, was the complete and polar opposite.  We've been craving these delicious fries for almost a week now and had the opportunity to grab a plate. After hours of getting ready, we arrived at the restaurant at about 1105 PM. We were sadden to learn that the kitchen was closed and they could not service. She explicitly mentioned this reverse happy hour was from 9-11 pm. We thought this was a little odd given a week ago we had came at the same exact time, was served, and the waiter had to check if the kitchen was closed around 1145 when we wanted a desert. If closing the kitchen an hour early is normal, I can't understand why last weeks waiter had to still double check; he would have said \"our kitchen closes at 11\" not \"let me see what I can do (the service one would expect).

Shocked outside of the now closed restaurant, we went to the website to review the deal, and low and behold the ad read that happy hour was from 10pm to close. It even made mention of the appetizers!! Frustrated that we were mislead, we went back in the restaurant and simply wanted to let the staff know there was a possible error on the website. After the bartender realized we did not want drinks she wanted nothing to do with us. She was rude, unaccommodating, and had a disgusting hickey on her arm, which in my opinion that sets a low standard for a business and is frankly trashy for this scale of restaurant. She then snootily said, \"Ill get the manager if you want\". We agreed thinking that the manager would be able to clarify the situation and give us some sort of explanation.

 Instead, the manager came out of the back walking angrily like some kind of WWE wrestler jumping into the ring. Her body language told me that she was not very pleased with the presence of customers and that is exactly how it went. Her first words were, \"what can I help you with\". You can tell she was agitated she had to come out of the back and do her job. We showed her the misleading ad and and how her bartender said the happy hour was it was 9-11. In the least empathetic way she said, \"the website changed\". At this point I was very shocked that someone could be so rude, specifically in the brand and name of a business. I showed her how I got to the website through yelp and asked her what the exact website was. She responded with, \"Well, what do you want me to do about it?\". I did not need her to do anything but give me an explanation in a professional manner and possibly find a solution or even resolve the issue. I was dumbfounded at this point that I was being treated like this by a manager who was using fighting words. 

In dismay we began to exit, however I did want to get the managers name to let the company know what happened. She then said \"I don't need to tell you my name\". I was frozen at this point, any proud business manager should not have shame in giving their first name. My friend pulled his cellphone out because at this point we could not believe this was happening and needed to get footage to show to management. Before she knew she was being recorded she said, \"Are you deaf\", after I had asked her name another time. When she realized she was on camera, she threatened to call the police. At no point were we suggesting any aggression. She called them because we were recording; not because she felt threatened. We wanted to know her name and a proper business manager should be able to handle a simple business issue without the negative attention of the police. We then left the restaurant because frankly we were hungry and this was getting out of hand. We had no interest ruining our Friday night and wasting time talking to the police over such a common restaurant scenario. She then began to follow us and harass us into staying until the police came. She was shouting, \"Where are you going, why are you leaving now, why are you running away?\". Friends, I tell you I cannot believe we were being provoked. 

Its really disappointing. It was payday. It was Friday. We wanted wine, appetizers, and maybe even a hot plate. I am very high on greek food and given our experience last week I had high expectations for this place. Yet as a customer service professional myself, food enthusiast, and aspiring entrepreneur,  I ca"}
{"text":"what gives?  they closed  in the middle of September.  that's it...just plain closed."}
{"text":"Great roasted garlic hummus, and their mojitos were surprisingly good too."}
{"text":"I'm Greek, so I wasn't so sure about a Greek chain...Until I had the Greek fries.  If loving them is wrong, I don't want to be right.  The Greek salad and Avgolemono soup are also very good!  Great staff and I haven't been there yet where it's been overly crowded.  Overall, it's good food at good prices.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Found this through restaurant.com, and boy was I glad! The food was delish! Not to mention it was happy hour so appetizers were only $4 and drinks were $3. The atmosphere was very nice; we sat outside among the Christmas-lit palm trees.

For appetizers we had the Bruschetta, Hummus Trio, and Calamari. They all tasted great, especially the creamy, flavorful hummus. 

Grecian Delight Pizza was pretty good as well.

Baklava cheesecake was good but doesn't compare to Cheesecake Factory of course. However, the Flambe Baklava was A-MA-ZING! Crispy ice cream atop baklava, dressed with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and then set on fire with Bacardi 151. As my friend said, \"Diabetes served cold.\" Yummy!

We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I walked past here going to another restaurant (I should have crossed the street to go here.).  I came here the next day and it was great!  
There were minimal staff but I ate dinner early on this day.  I had the braised lamb.  The portions were great and the food...super tender!  The veggies with it was a nice selection but kinda cold.  That didn't detract much though.  I had to wait for another drink but was impressed when a different server got it for me.  Finally, the was a 10% off on Yelp for checking in, but I chose not to use it because the food was so good.
Improvements: pay closer attention to the food temps, eliminate the physical barriers between wait staff and customers or have staff frequently in the dining room, and clear away some of the papers plastered throughout the establishment.  Small physical changes could add ambiance and eliminate distractions.  Also, add more Greek cultural items...besides the beautiful staff."}
{"text":"It was good, service was friendly and fine.  I had the spanakopita, one of my favourite dishes and it was crispy and good.  Hubby had the gyro platter and it was decent.  We'll probably go back and try other items."}
{"text":"They make the only baklava I've ever liked! 
It was softer and not as heavy as the ones I've tasted elsewhere. The honey tasted like fresh natural honey instead of candy. Me likee ;) 

They also have baklava cheesecake, which is their own creation and not offered anywhere else. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was yummy!

I washed both of these desserts down with a glass of white wine. I forgot which one it was, all I remember is it was our servers favorite. 

Next time maybe I'll try a main entree, lol. :)

The service was good. They accommodated a large group of us. Our server was professional & friendly. 


Parking in this area can be a bear, but there happens to be a big parking garage directly East of this location! Very convenient."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this spot and decided to give it a try since we love Greek food and it's not too far from our place. When we walked in we were greeted pretty quickly and asked to sit outside, even though it was a bit warm at the time, they had a great deal of misters. 

We started with the traditional hummus, which was honestly the best part of the whole meal.  If we go back I'll probably just have this as a meal! We also had the Lamb Souvlaki - which was tasty, but the meat was just a bit tough.  The drinks we had were made well by the bartender.

The service was done well, but was definitely on the slow side, which may have been due to us sitting outside when there was only one other group out there also.

Overall: B
Very \"A-OK\" place to go if you like hummus and drinks! We will probably wait on another Groupon if we go again."}
{"text":"Have not been there in a while.sorry I came back, Place smell like Pine Sol real bad! Bearly no meat on the Gyro pita no dressing on the Greek salad."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Not on the menu, but ask for the sauteed spinach. Definitely coming back the next time I am in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Large and tasty gyro pitas.  Great crispy fries."}
{"text":"a friend and i walked in with literally 25 minutes to eat. we told the host and he was like \"yeah, we can get the food out for you\". awesome. we got some nice seats at the bar right in front of some flatscreens playing the giants game. honestly, 5 minutes later our food comes up nice and hot. the gyro platter was pretty yummy. the gyro meat was on point and there was a lot of it. my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs which was also very good. service was great and our waiter was super cute...definitely a bonus. =)"}
{"text":"Posted a review a couple of weeks ago with some complaints.  Got an immediate response from the owner inviting us back to try again.
The server and the owner both made sure to check on how we liked everything. Were very open to our comments and I felt that the owner had definitely tried to improve on everything we had objected to previously. Said they were making further improvements to the menu and to the outdoor seating.
Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I was stationed in Greece for over a year and I am surprised that you can screw up fried cheese let alone Slovaki.  I had a nice talk with the manager who said he was also in Greece, not sure if I believe it, but if he has been there then he should be ashamed of that dry meat.  This chain is a disgrace to Greece.  It's extremely hard to find a good Greek place in AZ, but look else where.  This place isn't worth your money."}
{"text":"Husband and I were at Tanger outlets yesterday and decided to grab a bite to eat at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.  The only reason they are receiving a 2 is because the food was amazing.  However, the service was easily a 1.  We asked our server for a children's menu and never received one, we actually took it off a table that was being cleaned.  Then we had asked for extra napkins, not once, not twice, but four times.  I just got up and went to the restroom to wash my sons hands. Our water and iced tea were never refilled. It was just a freakn mess.  Such a dang shame because the food was amazing, but I'll probably never go again just because of the service."}
{"text":"Voted #1 Greek Restaurant in Arizona for three years, this is my favorite place to go Greek.  
Go to any one of the six locations in the valley, and you will immediately be surrounded by the mediterranean atmosphere of Greece.  Wall murals, paintings with the sea beyond, greek music playing, and of course...the food!
Appetizers, and an empty stomach are a must here.  The helpings from any order on the menu are enough for two, so I would recommend bringing a group so you can sampe it all!
Start with the Flaming Saganaki, the  wonderfully delicious imported greek cheese, flamed at the table with ouzo and metaxa.  ($7.95)  Follow that by the Fat Greek Dips ($9.95), which is an assortment of all the popular pita dips including various flavors of hummus and baba ganoush.  
If you are new to Greek, do the Meat Lovers for all ($16.95), their \"symposium of ecstasy.\"  Lamb chops, pork, chicken, beef souvlaki, gyro, mousakam pastitsio, and tzatziki.  Ideal for two or more, you can sample a number of well seasoned greek specialties.  My favorites are chicken souvlaki and gyro.  The souvlaki is very well seasoned and marinated, and grilled on a skewer.  The gyro is a combination of beef and lamb, carved off a rotisserie, very flavorful, very rich.
For a lighter appetite, there are five different pitas to choose from (4.95), wraps, and many salads.
Wash it all down with some Greek beer, I like the amber Athena.  Should you have room for dessert, try the Flambe Baklava.  It is stacked rolls of phillo dough with chocolate and honey, ice cream ball rolled in pistachio, and a shot of flaming bacardi 151....perfect end!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by accident and what a pleasant surprise!  Started with the saganaki which was the only disappointment of the meal.  It was sliced way too thin and it wasn't coated enough so it wouldn't stick to the bottom of the serving dish.  My husband and I order the meat lovers special which included a little bit of everything,  The portion could have feed 4 people!  Best of all .... everything was delicious. There wasn't anything on the platter we didn't like."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going to My Big Fat Greek.  We love the outdoor area at night and the dining room is not bad.  We have never had a bad dish either and we have gone quite a few times.  The only thing I would say is it is a little pricey, but we always go with restaurant dot com certificates.  Without those certificates I may be a little more hesitant and for the price probably go to a restaurant with a known chef, but for now I will stick with four stars."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Cheap food for huge portions. I mostly end up with the El Greco Calzone, Aegean Club and always the Keftedes. I never go here without a coupon from the mailer and sometime the coupons on Restaurant.com can be good depending on the season."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise from a not-so-tried and true formula. I mean, naming a restaurant chain after a movie is not typically a path to success (was there a book or something else I don't know about?), but, in this case, it managed to work. 

The food is very good, the ambiance is great, and the service is fantastic. I am not a true connoseuir of Greek food like I claim to be with Mexican food, but from what I can tell, the food here measures up nicely. 

Big portions help make this a nice affordable lunch or dinner option around Old Town."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area and beyond!  The service is always great, and the food is always absolutely perfect.  The portions are gigantic.  I always have to share my meal with at least one other person.  My favorite dish is the Gyro Dinner.  It comes with gyro meat, pita,  lemony potatoes, rice, and grilled vegetables.  It is AMAZING!  Also, the  Marinated Chicken Breast is another favorite, and comes with the same things.  Their Pizzas are delicious too, and the Avgolemono Soup is out of this world.  The Dolmades have also become a recent favorite MMmmmmmm!!!!!!!  This restaurant is one of the very few that has never disappointed me.  It is consistently fabulous, and I recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"If we had stuck to the grape leaves with pita and the gyro this might be a five star review.  Grape leaves served warm like my Turkish aunt used to make, great pita, and wonderfully spiced gyro.  Unfortunately, we also ordered moussaka and baklava.  The moussaka was mediocre, way too much bechamel, poor tomato sauce on top and not well spiced.  The pilaf was awful, it tasted like cardboard.  I still can't figure out what they did to get that flavor.  The baklava was an unfortunate mash up of pecan pie and baklava.  It was sweet, but we cut out half the filling before we could make it taste like baklava.  The retsina was also poor quality.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  Ambience nice.  It deserves the three star average it has, but could be more if its other dishes were as good as its dolmades."}
{"text":"Ended up here since Mill was slammed for the ASU game..ordered the souvlaki, one beef and the other lamb.  The lamb was pretty under seasoned, the beef had a better taste except it was chewy and hard to swallow.  Had to spit out a piece in the napkin so someone got a surprise unfortunately.  Didn't think I got enough for what I paid for either.  The veg was also under seasoned, just bland tasting food.  I looked around and most people were ordering Apps like the hummus, so I may have missed something.  The waitress was very good and friendly, the extra star is for her.  Not sure I can go back with all the choices around there."}
{"text":"There $6 lunch specials are fantastic.  Service is always good, waitresses are cute, and the place has a good positive vibe.  I might give them 5 stars after I check out their happy hour or actually go there for dinner."}
{"text":"The name of this Greek restaurant is so bad it gives me shivers. When I first moved to Tempe, I resolved never to go here because the name seemed in such cheesy taste. 

Then came the night when I was hungry for a real meal and everything else was closed. These guys stay open till 11 pm for dinner most nights, and I found myself breaking my pact. I was quite surprised to find a really nice, extensive menu with very tasty dishes. I do love my spanikopita, ovgelamano soup, and Greek salad, and I was pleased by their preparation and large portions. I also must say their lemon potatoes are superb. Kind words must also be said for their appetizers, particularly their bowl of pickled veggies and excellent hummus. 

I'm sure there are people out there who just love the name, and maybe wouldn't even try Greek food unless there was some movie tie-in. But, guys, change your name to make it as good as your food! I'll even take \"Zorba the Greek's!\""}
{"text":"the food is hit or miss. however it is delicious most of the time. a couple times i ordered something weird sounding and it was weird tasting. i wouldn't recommend trying anything you've never had before. however their greek fries, \"fire\" cheese appetizers, and steak medallion entree is absolutely mouth watering. their fallafel sandwich is ok, the greek dressing is good. NOT AS AUTHENTIC AS SOME GREEK PLACES B/C ITS A CHAIN, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD. they don't explain the menu enough though-that is a complaint since it's all in greek words. service was good."}
{"text":"My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in all of eternity is Haji Baba in Tempe. Is it any wonder, then, why I am so deflatedly underwhelmed by MBFGR? If you want a real hamburger, you don't go to Denny's, you go to Chuck Box. My analogy stands. Totally bland and mediocre food, flavors distilled to barely detectable levels for the masses. The saginaki is good, but not bursting with tangy lemony sizzling energy like it should. The server's half-hearted \"opa\" was fitting. They don't even light it next to the table anymore, making me wonder if their liability insurance put the kibosh on such activities after a particular incident, maybe or maybe not involving the singing off of a customer's facial hair. The spinach salad was absolutely coated in a syrupy balsamic dressing that was practically cloying in its sweetness. The pita is good, although its thick, spongy, white-bread consistency isn't particularly what I expect in a good pita. The sangria was a tick superior to Boone's. Meh all around."}
{"text":"I really really wish I could write a great review for this place, but I just can't. It's slowly going down hill.  

The first time I came here was wonderful, the food was great - inexpensive, & the service was too. Our waiter made our experience worth a second trip the following week.

The following week: My boss & I came in for lunch. It was clear they were a little short staffed so we remained patient while we waited to be seated. Once seated the server forgot to leave our menus and were not able to get his attention for another 5 or so minutes after that. We saw how busy he was so we just thought we'd cut him some slack. Another 10 minutes went by before he asked for our drink orders. He took them & hurriedly walked away before we could also give our food orders...5 or so minutes later we received our drink orders delivered by the chef... Then, FINALLY our server came & asked for our food orders. I ordered a Chicken sandwich off the lunch menu, due to diet restrictions I asked for no bun & some lettuce on the side instead so I could make a lettuce wrap out of it. He seemed really thrown off by my request & let us know that I was going to be charged extra...for lettuce............? - Anyhow, the food was delivered. The chicken on my sandwich was EXTREMELY dry. It was like a chicken jerky sandwich. My side salad had to be promoted to my lunch for the day. We left a little unhappy but, decided they may have been having an off day & we'd try again.

The next visit was a month or so later. They ran out of lettuce. Seriously guys? Almost every dish you offer has lettuce in it. Once again, everyone has their days. Things happen, but we were not offered any sort of accommodation for the mishap & that's what solidified my decision to never return to this location."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 star ratings, but this was definitely a 5 star experience. Granted, we were open about wanting to use the check-in offer ($10 off $30 or more, bounus!) so that may have tipped them off that we'd most likely be writing a review. 
They gave us the wi-fi passcode no problem to let us get on our iPod to bring up the offer. Our server was attentive and friendly. Even helped me talk my husband out of ordering soda while he's supposed to be cutting back. We got the gyro dinner and the mousaka, both were very good and much more food then we were able to finish (yay tomorrow's lunch). The manager even stopped by the table to see how we were and offered us a side of marinara to try with the mousaka. We ended the meal with an order of baklava which was great, but kinda small for $4. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great indoor and out door area. Amazing music. Amazing fries ( I call them Crack Fries), Greek bread & hummus. Not a fan of the giant cups that are mostly filled with ice though."}
{"text":"this is my real udpated review.  demetrios sent me my gift card right away and my boyfirend(also a fellow yelper) and i went with his roommate. the service was great- we had the same server as last time and she was really helpful. the greek dressing is amazing- very creamy and very authentic. i got the slouvaki- the only bad thing was that they were out of lamb but the beef and chicken were very good. the mediterranean pizza was amazing and the feta burger was ordered again, this time medium well, and was well cooked. i will be returning and appreciate the chance to give it another try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely has a nice selection of food to choose. The food taste good and really delicious. Really worth every penny for the quality of the food you get here. This place has a nice ambience which really makes it good for fine dining. The service was okay, no problems whatsoever. Although it might need a little improvement in that area. Still a worthy place to go to. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is an Arizona chain restaurant with plans to expand outside the state.

I must say this upfront---this isn't truly authentic Greek food.  Sure, some of the expected dishes were there such as the flaming saganaki, spanakopita, baklava, galacktobouriko,  avgolemono soup, etc. but there were also some Italian entrees, club sandwiches and burgers.  The latter are not things found in a more authentic Greek restaurant but the advantage of them being on the menu is that those who don't like or want Greek food can find something to eat.

We were quite pleased to see avgolemono soup on the menu.  So three of us ordered it and were very disappointed.  It would be a perfectly fine soup if it was called chicken soup but that wasn't what we were expecting.  The soup only had a very faint lemony flavor.  One in our party said that by adding some ground pepper it seemed to bring out more lemon flavor.  It did---to a small extent.

Three of us ordered marinated chicken breast (which is considered a \"heart healthy\" dish).  It consists of a grilled boneless, skinless chicken breast which we all found to be overcooked and dried out.  The sauce, which was lemony (unlike the soup) helped in that regard.  Also, it came with roasted lemon potatoes which were flavorful (why couldn't they do that with the soup?), sauteed vegetables and what appeared to be a saffron rice.  Surprisingly, the rice wasn't all dried out!

One person ordered the stuffed peppers.  After he gave his order, the waitress came back to tell him that there was only one stuffed pepper left.  (I can understand that if we came near closing time but we were here for an early dinner!).  He was given the option of adding part of another entree to his dinner.  Instead, he said to just give him the one stuffed pepper.  The restaurant gladly accomodated him and charged him less for the dinner.  He did like the stuffed pepper and said it was flavorful.  Also, he thought that two of them would have been way too much!

For dessert, two of us decided to share a piece of baklava.  The filling tasted like baklava filling should taste but the phyllo crust---not so.  A good baklava should have a crispy, flaky crust and be drizzled with honey.  This crust was not flaky or crispy.  Plus there was no drizzled honey.

On the plus side, service was excellent and the place was kid-friendly.  

In conclusion, if you go, don't expect a truly authentic Greek dining experience.   Go with reasonable expectations and you will do fine."}
{"text":"Too much salt on everything. Reviews overrate it. Best atmosphere by day. Night feels more like sports & spirits bar."}
{"text":"the only place that was open on new year's day for dinner at 10pm. we drove into phoenix late that night and were itching for some southwestern cuisine. sadly, none of the restaurants in this plaza was open by the time we got there. 

MBFGR was still open so we went in and ordered the three hummus plate, the gyro wrap, and a spanikopita. nothing was horrible or bad tasting. we liked what we ate, though i admit i had better greek food in LA. we got a little jealous that we didn't order the obnoxious flambe cheese that apparently came with an entire show. 

next time, i'd get the burning cheese."}
{"text":"i've been to the Tempe MBFGR three times for lunch in the last two months and used to go to the Scottsdale location 3-4 times a year when my office was two blocks away.
the food is always good - love the Greek fries with the lemon-oregano sauce, and the flaming Saganaki is very good too.  i always have the gyro pita, because it is just so damn good, and reminds me of every little Taverna i stumbled into in Greece and the Aegean Islands.  the tzatziki sauce varies between enough and not-enough garlic, but i always get an extra cup of the stuff,,,, nectar!  Last time we ate there, Liz had the feta burger and she raved about it for a week.
the waitrons and staff are always good and always friendly - i don't know how they do that, but it's true"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Didn't care to much for the hummus which really disappoints me because I believe every Greek restaurant should know how to make a darn good hummus. You know what I'm saying? But maybe it was just a bad batch.

I had the chicken souvlaki meal and it was pretty good but the potatoes were to lemony for my likeing and the veggies were just meh."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place probably a thousand times and always thought to myself, \"self, you should go check that place out\". Well, friends, I am happy to say, the day has finally arrived.

Why, oh why, did I wait to stinkin' long to get here?? This place is amazing!!! The food is flavorful, generously portioned and the staff treats you like family. Oompah!!

Here's a little tip for all of you hungry greek loving people out there, get the meat lovers platter. But, now trust me on this, you can half the size you order. For example, a platter for two will feed four very hungry,  large men, and still leave you will a take out box to go. As the menu description aptly proclaims, the meat lovers platter is a SYMPOSIUM OF ECSTASY. 

If you are like me, and keep saying to yourself \"I should check that place out\", learn from my mistake and get your booty there asap."}
{"text":"this restaurant is disgusting. my shrimp was overcooked, my sister's meat undercooked, and the service was neglectful and apathetic. completely overpriced for the crap they call food. i would never eat there again."}
{"text":"Pretty good greek-ish food on Mill. Its also close to my work and great for big groups. Service is always decent. The lunch menu is great and you can add fries or greek salad for only 99 cents. I have learned to order the regular gyro pita. Its the best. The chicken isn't always fresh tasting. Also, their drink cups are huge, which is great in summer."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 8 and ordered some pizzas to split as well as a few other meals. My sister and I shared a sausage pizza with Alfredo and it went beyond our expectations. The sausage was very obviously made in store which made it ten times better. Our waiter was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a feast, but even with the $50 coupon, it was a big let-down. There wasn't a Greek soul IN the place--flies were buzzing everywhere, my lamb soulaki was overdone, my side dishes were exactly the same as my husband's, and he was supposed to be having a gyro platter--with none of the appropriate sides to a gyro. His meat was stone cold. Everything was very UNseasoned. The only good part was the calamari, but the dips for the calamari were more like salsa or ranch dips--I began to think I was in a Mexican joint instead of a 'Greek\" place--everyone running the place was Mexican. Maybe the chain was originally started and run by Greeks, and the name says Greek, but it had no other connection, having probably sold out to Mexicans years ago....even the wine was lousy.
Next time, go to Carraba's...WAY way better food, service, ambiance, cleaniness, menu, wine."}
{"text":"Friendly service and generous portions. The food was solid, tho not deeply flavored. I'd dig stronger tastes. Immense cups of unsweetened iced tea. The lemonades are very sweet - a bit fruit-punchy - good for the sweet tooth. Victoria was a terrific server, with good suggestions."}
{"text":"Short story: food is delicious and portions are HUGE.

When my friend told me he would take me to a pretty good Greek place, I already had in my mind a gyro...which I did not find on the menu here. Sad. But, I was able to satisfy my craving for gyro meat by ordering a gyro platter.

Served with your choice of two sides and a healthy portion of gyro meat and tzatziki sauce, I felt like this platter really hit the spot. I paired it with fresh steamed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and zucchini) and rice. I was stuffed. My friend opted for the steak platter...not very Greek, sans the rice with Greek spices. And my other friend opted for a calamari salad. When she noticed dressing was delivered already mixed in, it occurred she had forgotten to mention her allergy to dairy products...this was quickly escalated to the waiter who wasted no time confirming all the ingredients in the dish from the salad to battered calamari to the pita delivered on the side.

Excellent customer service.

Two of us were also in SF Giants gear having come from a Spring Training game. Our waiter relentlessly teased us offering discounts if we bought AZ-team jerseys (ain't happening) and a meeting with Freddy Sanchez (who apparently frequents this location Mondays and Wednesdays) - it was a fun (and filling) time overall"}
{"text":"I wish it was closer to home and easier to get to, but then again I would probably put on 10 extra pounds if that were the case.  The Greek Fries are some of my favorite in town, The Gyro itself is the perfect size with just the right amount of lamb meat on there, and most importantly the Tzatziki sauce is amazing!  I find the sauce is what can make or break a good Gyro and if its no good I'm not going back.  Needless to say I will be back to Mill ave for My Big Fat Greek Restaurant but just not on the weekends when ASU is in session."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  Plus, I love good Greek food!

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   The gyro meat was bland, may as well have been hamburger steak.  My side salad was a soggy mess and the tziki sauce tastes like cucumber soup.   Upside, the price was reasonable and the service during lunch on a Thursday afternoon was quick."}
{"text":"I had been to another location, and while the food was acceptable there (not good, just acceptable) it was HORRIBLE here.

Our $40 got us an order of pastitsio that  was so dried out and overcooked we could not split it with a knife.  Not even a steak knife. The slices of crispy edged gyro meat I was looking forward to in our Greek salad were nowhere in sight.  Instead we were given an undercooked cubed version of the same.  Our Baba ghanoush was not the light whipped consistency it should have been.... it was a smoky thick heavy texture.  No one ate it. It was left on the plate.

The patio was nice.  It would have been pleasant to sit there and eat.... if the meal hadn't been so horrid.

The only redeeming quality here was the service.  The waiter a man who appeared to be the manager were terrific.  They were friendly and quick to check on us the whole time we were there.  I hope they find jobs at better restaurants because i would like to be waited on by them again, but I will NOT be going back there."}
{"text":"Came here to treat myself to a Valentines dinner. Even though they were winding down, they treated me excellently. I had a feast of Greek fries, Greek chicken wings, and a cup of soup. It was all very delicious."}
{"text":"For being a Big Fat Chain Restaurant, it's not too bad. They always have really good iced tea, the lemon/chicken/rice soup is good. Gyros, good.

I do want to try there happy hour sometime, I'll report back again after a big fat greek happy hour!"}
{"text":"The transition of moving to the West Valley from Tempe has been challenging when it comes to outstanding restaurants.  The West is more of a Chili's, Olive Garden kind of area so looking at a \"local\" chain wasn't my first choice but Big Fat Greek Glendale is exceptional. We have eaten here several times over the past two or three years and have taken friends and family whenever we have visitors.  Saturday nights a belly dancer thoroughly engaged and entertained our entire party, especially the kids.

The food is outstanding and the portions are substantial. Unfortunately, I am stuck ordering the Gyro Platter every time because it's so good and so big I just can't bring myself to try anything else. Though when dining with other I often sneak tastes and have never been disappointed.  At least twice a month I start to crave the traditional hummus and lemon potatoes.

I have noticed, on occasion, somewhat unhappy tables around us because of service but they seem to be normal experiences when dealing with human beings. We, however, have always had great service and never experienced anything deserving of some of the of the drama-laden reviews people post. I imaging there is always drama where they go.

This is on of our favorite West Valley restaurants. Large beers and great food are a difficult mix to complain about."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it seems to get worse. The Flaming Saganaki was still pretty tasty but everything else we had was generic at best. I'm a self proclaimed foodie, so as there was nothing wrong with this place there was also nothing spectacular. I don't want to eat at a restaurant because it is ok. I want to eat somewhere because it has good food that makes me want to go back because there's no where else that I can get food like that. This certainly does not offer that. Go to any mall quality fast Greek spot and you'll get the same food. Also, the gyro meat was warm, not hot, dry, and bland. This was I think my last attempt at hoping their food would get better again."}
{"text":"In the beginning.... Haha, we had their calamari and it was very rubbery almost like rubber bands. Tables has a layer of grit on them, couldn't even glide your fingers over it. But overall once we got our food it tasted great, and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I pretty much love everything there is about Greek food. I would be happy with absolutely anything off a Greek menu. That being said, you'd think I would be a little more picky considering this is a chain restaurant and not a traditional mom-and-pop shop. However, I've eaten here a few times and I've enjoyed it every time. Since it's a chain I doubt they start from scratch on every dish; however, the food has been nothing but fantastic each time I've come! 
Our server pointed me toward a mid-range Greek red wine which I didn't get the name of but was mildly tart with little aftertaste. The gyro sandwich is enormous and not greasy at all, and the meat is soft and chewy. Didn't come with enough tzatziki but that's because I like to drown my french fries in it as well as putting it on my sandwich! French fries were thin-cut and crispy on the outside, chewy inside. 
Happy hour specials are pretty good and they do \"reverse\" happy hour as well, which is later at night. The happy hour menu includes \"Greek\" sliders and mini pizzas which I don't think are on the regular menu. 
Spanakopita is flaky and the filling is lighter than expected! There is a hummus trio that comes with yet more pita bread, but I found that I prefer the original, plain hummus. The other two flavors I don't remember that well as I didn't care for them much. 
Mousaka is hearty and warm and a big dish. Awesome comfort food. 
For dessert, the baklava, while awesome with complex flavors and textures, was a little heavy (and a little oily on the bottom) and served with whipped cream, which I could have done without.
Overall, I like to come here because I always end up liking what I order."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been mediocre (except for the falafel, which is horrendous. and the lemon potatoes, which are pretty good) and my ex-bf swears their gyro gave him the trots. The spanikopita is greasy and the fries are always cold and flavorless. Why go here when there are a million better Greek /Mediterranean places in the valley?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here when we were visiting family.  The food was so fantastic that we visited more than once.  The skordalia was fantastic and served with fresh pitas!   The gyros were so tasty!  The service was great too!  Wish we had one in PA!"}
{"text":"I've only tried this restaurant twice based on all the referrals from my friends. But it has not disappointed me yet. The service is great, the games are televised, the atomsphere is fun and the food is delicious! I tried the flaming saganaki for the first time and enjoyed it so much that I nearly ordered another for myself only. And don't forget to try their Greek fries. Smothered in feta and their specialty Dijon sauce, ask for extra sauce because it's so good you'll need it for your entree too. I rarely eat Greek cuisine and haven't found a place where I love their gyro meat, but I found it here! I'm looking forward to coming back when I visit again because I'm already craving everything I ate!"}
{"text":"Okay, $10 off $25 or more with a checkin? Heck ya. My 2 daughters and I pulled in here on a whim and were very happy we did. 

We were seated immediately and were served our waters. I ordered a Sangria which was freaken delicious. Food came out pretty quickly and it was great. We ordered hummus and bread appetizer, Greek fries, and split the chicken pita with Greek salad. Oh and cheesecake. 

I was a little worried when we got our check because the girl had never seen the yelp check in coupon. But she came back and said it was all good so my check ended up being $15! Wow. 

Great place. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow...thought I'd try it and had a lot more hopes for this place. Waitress knew nothing of the menu nor the minuscule beer selection. Recommended the special to us, and then had to read the ingredients of it from a cue card, even though she claimed to have just eaten it. Food was ok but we ordered the roasted chicken wrap, and were billed for the roasted chicken wrap, but were served the veggie wrap. Really? Not sure who goofed that one up. I'll stick to pita jungle."}
{"text":"Only my 2nd time at a My Big Fat Greek restaurant. First time at this location though. We ordered the humus trio for appetizer (garlic, roasted red bell pepper, and jalapeno cilantro). The hummus was good. I think I made the mistake by ordering their spaghetti and meatballs dish. The meatballs were more like meat logs and didn't have much flavor to them.  The dish overall lacked sauce, as if their were being stingy with the sauce.  I didn't finish my dish."}
{"text":"Walked in here randomly the food was good.  The place was empty on a Saturday night which i was surprised but figured we would get served faster.  The Gyro was wraped in a tortilla (seriously?) is there no pita's in Scottsdale?  Also ordered the spanakopita it was tiny but tasty enough for two people.  The waitress couldn't wait to get us out of there by the bartender was friendly"}
{"text":"I was in Tempe today unexpectedly and decided to check this place out for the first time in a few years. I mentioned to the server I was unfortunately in a rush. He was still super professional. My food came out and was amazing, he suggested the caprese (?) gyro I accepted the recommendation. He was right. Great choice, and I will be back again. Great experience. Only suggestion would be remodeling the men's bathroom."}
{"text":"It's hard to review Big Fat Greek when you've had obviously better greek food in Phoenix, but here goes.

Great service, they do put on a fantastic show when someone orders the \"Flaming Feta\". 

Their portions are copious, but the gyro is usually dry, the beer is mediocre, and the pita bread was ok.

The positive? Lemon Potatoes. I could eat a vat of those.

And that's why they get a two. Good service, good potatoes."}
{"text":"I ordered a Caesar Salad to go.  Never have I a paid 9.00 for a worst salad. I was unaware the Greeks use brown old lettuce and Romaine"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like a gyro and it isn't the easiest thing to find in this area.  If only there was a Daphnes around!  Even though I wasn't in the mood for a sit down restaurant, I wanted to give it a try.  Went in for lunch and it wasn't busy at all, which isn't a great sign.  I was a little disapointed in the interior.  Although it was clean, it looked really old and outdated.  On the plus side, the menu offered a good selection.  Of course, I had the Gyro plate and was very impressed.  It satisfied exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I've never been to one of these restaurants before. 

Awesome fries. Great lunch pita special. My Hawaiian pita was delicious. Free refills on $3 drinks. Pitas were large and not able to pick up and eat but still delicious! 

Really enjoyed my meal. Price was it was fair. Iced tea was good. They have coke products if you care. 

With Phoenix being full of chain restaurants, it was nice to try something that wasn't in Chicago. This is still a chain but still delicious."}
{"text":"FYI, This used to be the Big Fat Greek that we had stopped going to! It is now the Pita Kouzina and is right at the top of our weekly visit restaurants and it will be yours too. The food is delicious, the portions are large, the service fast & friendly and the new owners, Noel & his wife, are delightful. The dolmades are the best, you will want to double order these. Regular fries are excellent, wish I had of ordered the Greek fries. The muscles are large, fresh and very tasty. If you love beets and salad, you will want to order the red & golden beet salad. I always as for dressing on the side and we weren't bashful about ordering a second serving of the pita. My gyro was perfect, my wife's spanakopita was cooked perfectly and could have had just a touch more cheese. Our daughter loved the kebab. If you love potatoes, this is the place for you. We can't wait until our Greek loving family - friends visit so we can take them to our new Best Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a big fan of Greek food.  That said, I really enjoyed my lunch here.  The location out in Ahwatukee is a nice addition to an area that otherwise lacks decent restaurants.  For lunch, they have their pitas for $5 which has to be the best deal in town.  I had the chicken soulvaki pita with fries and had a bite of the fallafel pita also ordered.  We also had the jalapeno hummus as an app.  Everything was good.  My chicken was a little dry but at $5, that's forgivable.  The hummus was very good and the fallafel was really tasty.  

The food, what I tried anyway, is pretty good.  Not outstanding but a really good option for lunch or a casual dinner.  The value was terrific.  I liked the small patio seating area and the fact that the side windows open up the dining room on a nice day.  I also like the fact that the manager/proprietor sat down at the table next to us and apologized for the poor service the woman received.  He then informed the woman the server was no longer employed but that was no fault of hers and was something they knew was coming.  My only regret to the day was wishing I showed up 10 minutes earlier so I could have witnessed the incident that led to a server getting let go mid-shift!"}
{"text":"Consistently great .... I've been here several times now and have tried many things on the menu. My favorite has been the gyro wrap with a side of Greek salad (it's better bang for your buck than the Greek salad). My boyfriend always gets the Aegean Club which is divine and XXL. 

No matter what make sure you get the Greek fries. You can upgrade any order to come with Greek instead of regular fries (but I suggest just getting the full portion for your table). Seriously so good!!

Also, always great, fast, and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place has potential, but is lacking some critical elements in becoming a great asset to Mill Ave. I have been here twice and both times, the food was mediocre at best. The second time, a bug even crawled out of my friend's salad and the manager didn't even pay for the cost of the salad at the end of the meal. They have some fun items on the menu, including a flaming dessert and some great salads. They have some good deals on the happy hour, including a carafe of sangria - the sangria is pretty sugary however, so don't order it if you like a more traditional wine sangria."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here on a Monday. Staff was super friendly and efficient. I had the Gyro pate with veggies and potatoes. It was very good. They also have a nice outdoor patio where I enjoyed the beautiful 70 degree weather."}
{"text":"My colleague and I went to this restaurant on a recommendation from another colleague and it was really good!  Neither of us are very familiar with Greek food so we went off of the waiter's recommendations.  We shared a couple of appetizers, the dolmades and the flaming saganaki.  We both agreed that the dolmades were good, but the flaming saganaki was probably the best part of the whole meal.  For our entrees, I had the Spanakopita (yum!), and he had the Pastitsio.  His looked really good with the creamy bechamel sauce and he said it tasted great.  The waitstaff was friendly and the prices are extremely reasonable.  

Probably will be back due to the convenience of the location and because we're here on business."}
{"text":"Great food and service --- plus an incredible happy hour. Most expensive appetizer is $6. Drinks start at $3.  You can make a meal out of it. 

Tip - order the Flaming Saganaki Cheese. They set the cheese on fire.

Our server Stephanie was personable and gave some great recommendations. 

Great atmosphere. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Tried the Gyro and love it. Great Patio!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend for anyone to go to this restaurant when looking for good greek food.  The food was a disappointment that can only be explained by the use of store bought products, forgoing the usual homemade variety, which is something that I would not expect going to a restaurant.

   The hummus was so basic that it could not have been made by a chef, it was just chickpeas and tahini, no added spices.  It is something that can be made for under a $1 when done correctly, but they seem to feel the need to charge an obscene amount of money for it.  Maybe a greek restaurant should stick to the more greek dishes, I would consider this arabic.

    The \"award winning\" gyro plate was ok at most with the only authentic part of it being the potatoes.  They also gave way too small of a portion of tzatziki, barely enough to use for the pita and gyro.  However, I was ok with that because I would not consider it homemade tzatziki.  This is funny because all it requires is greek yogurt, cucumber, salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil.  Any beginner chef can make this.

   If under-spiced, store bought, and all around disappointing food for obscene prices is what you are looking for, look no further.  Otherwise, avoid this restaurant as you would vegan food."}
{"text":"Maybe I should give this place another chance but am a little skeptical.  We never saw our server after we got our food. Had to go inside to get our check.  I guess the food was ok--not sure what I expected--but didn't find anything to write home about. It was very plain--you get only what you order:  no sauces etc.   I want to try Greek again--but not there, probably."}
{"text":"My family went in to eat on a Sunday night after eating at other My Big Fat Greek Restaurants in the valley. We were seated right away but we waited about twenty minutes to get our drinks and another thirty minutes to get our appetizer. We asked for our daughters sake if we could have her food first after the appetizer and that did not occur. We got our food and it tasted great but when we asked for extra toppings they never brought them. When we were all done we waited and waited for a check. We asked three different people for it including the manager and he gave us the wrong one. They were not busy so I have no idea what was going on. I know we will not return to this location due to their service, the food was great but their service was bad."}
{"text":"ordered chicken caprese salad with salad sides. it was a great walk from the office and enjoyed the music with the food.  service is efficient and food is good. definitely great office lunch option."}
{"text":"Being so close to the hotel we were staying at, we figured we'd try it out.
In a place where everything on the menu seems so big, (the calzone was almost the size of my friend's face) the waitress was nice enough to offer a side Greek salad; which was the perfect size. 

The Greek Fries were really flavorful. Maybe that's just my way of saying salty...

Other then that, everything was good."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced! I love that Greek salad is an option instead of fries for the same price. I went with my parents for a late lunch and we all enjoyed our meals. I ordered the chicken pita and it was huge. 

I ordered a falafel, which was good, but I really love the yogurt cucumber sauce. 

If I ever visit my parents in Arizona again, I will definitely ask to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  The waiter knew the menu and was on top of things.  The price of food wasn't bad.  We did the 2 for 20 and got a decent amount of quality food.  I noticed the potatoes were a little salty.  The salads were some of the best dinner salads I have ever had.  We complained about the smoking on the patio near open restaurant windows -- the manager made it right and comped dessert.  Really, can't complaint.  Oh, and you have to try the Mojito's!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped here before the Diamond Backs v Padres game on August 22, 2014.  We ordered the gyro pita for $7 each, which came with a healthy portion of salad.  The gyro meat was a bit dry-not as fresh I would have liked.  But it was still good.

Price was perfect for a quick lunch.  Service was prompt."}
{"text":"I can't really compare the Greek food here to anywhere else since this is the only Greek restaurant I've been to, but what I can say is that their Gyro special is PHENOMENAL. I get it every time I dine there. Looking forward to trying the Athenian Spaghetti on my next visit. No complaints from me about this place, and I know I'll be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Since I retired and most of my colleagues work from home, we try and meet once a month at different restaurants.
This month we decided to try this restaurant 'cause it central to the valley.
I had their Chicken Souvlaki which was delicious. The chicken was cut in large cubes and oh so tender.
I've eaten there before when I worked downtown and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Who makes a platter for two for under $20 featuring enough lamb, gyro, chicken, beef, and pork to start your own farm with and then for kicks rice, lemon potatoes, and tzatziki sauce in abundance.  Oops! Did I forget to mention that they also had Pasticio on this platter.  I think I still have leftovers in my ice-box because it was sooo much food.  And it was sooooo good.
I'd give another star if the service was a wee bit more attentive and if the atmosphere were as nice as the one on Mill Ave.  Still, I clearly ate it all up and will return.  Maybe with Michael C.  Spanokopita sounds yummy right about now!"}
{"text":"Anytime I can get live Greek music and saganaki and ktopothes... I am compelled to brandish many stars! The people are sweet, the patio is fortunately positioned for good people watching, and the menu has something for even your pickiest of eaters!  Come here and be transported to Ellada via Mill."}
{"text":"I used to come here weekly, and always when my dad was in town.  Their food was incredible (almost anything on the menu made dad sublimely happy and he's a mega-foodie), their service was so... Greek-like, and the ambience was perfection.
A couple months ago, Dad came to town and insisted we go, it had been too long for him and he was craving it. A big fan of the Moussaka and Oso buco, he ordered what they had on special... and was gravely disappointed.  My salad was bleh, and I mostly just picked at it.  Their whole make-you-feel-like-family vibe had vanished, apparently it was renovated with the interior.  Speaking of, the interior renovations... they did a great job making it look like every other place in Old Town.
I have no idea who is running things, but a pink slip is on order. Pronto!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time because it is so close to our office.  I gave it 3 stars because it is good, not great.  Pita is awesome, everything else is OK.

Nice place, nice atmosphere, good service, but don't feel its overly special."}
{"text":"3 stars for food and 1 star for an excellent waiter.
This place is right across the street from my work so I took my parents who were visiting.  Not sure how accurate this review is on \"Greek\"  food since none of us had actual Greek food.  My dad had a salmon salad, my mom had the daily special of tilapia fish tacos (Mexican), and I had cochinita pibil (Mexican) which was also a special.  The cochinta pibil was ok.  My mom's fish tacos were better.  But of course, seeing as how we all didn't get an actual greek dish, this should be taken with a grain of salt.  
The service was very good - we had Isaiah for our waiter.  My dad liked that he explained everything thoroughly and didn't rush through his explanation.  He was calm and attentive at all times.  Great demeanor as my dad said.  Even the rest of the wait staff was good since they always made sure we had our glasses filled and were great about taking the plates away."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top-notch.  The wait for the food was a little longer than expected (could have been because it was a Friday night), but the food was delicious.  I had ordered the bone-in roasted lamb; it was tender and fell right off the bone.  I'm not much of a desert person, but I tried one of the deserts, the Baklava.  This was the best desert I have had in years.  Maybe it was my cravings, and then again, maybe not.  One odd thing though, the people in the restaurant cleared out by 8pm, which was kind of spooky for a Friday night.  Is there some Friday night TV show I'm missing out on?"}
{"text":"I come to this location every once in a while for lunch. It is located in downtown PHX at the Arizona center.  This is a solid lunch option. Gyro wrap in a pita with a side salad for $7.00. Not too shabby. Good service, food is good, I'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the only way to really enjoy all the many choices ... We overindulged for the happy hour price you cannot go wrong. A

Bathrooms were disgusting and it was a very slow Sunday when we went. Afraid to see what the kitchen looks like.

All the food was good, nothing spectacular but the price was right for it."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for some good falafels and I have a little sister who is not a fan of trying foods more exotic than hamburgers. My Big Fat Greek Restaurant offers Americanized Greek food, so it seemed like the perfect place for dinner for us to both find something we'd be happy with. We ordered a bunch of plates so she could sample some Greek food but also had the safety net of a pizza. 

The spanakopita - amazing. Hands down the best dish we had. Yummy flavors and lots of spinach. 

Falafels - pretty good! I could tell they were shaped by hand and not too greasy. Really moist inside and crispy outside, just how a falafel should be! I thought the spices were okay in the tzatziki. I like really strong flavoring and dill and my not-very-adventurous sister does not, so she happily ate her share. 

Pizza (margherita) - actually yummy for a Greek resturau. Tasted like homemade dough and fresh mozzarella. They were kinda skimpy on the cheese for my taste.

Mojito - the only real disappointment of the night. It tasted like sugar water and fresh mint with minimum booze. Oh well, I doubt the ancient Greeks were drinking minty cocktails.

I'm already looking forward to our next visit. Super vegetarian friendly and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGR's that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2."}
{"text":"On my first visit to My Big Fat Greek restaurant, three of us chose to split appetizers and a large salad for lunch.  An unsatisfying lunch, probably due to our choices, and not ordering a main dish.  

Our best dish was the spanokopita, a phylo filled pastry with spinach and cheese.  The other dishes were just okay.  A flaming cheese dish was tasty, but the 3 foot high flames were just scary - don't come near me with that!  

We tried the baba ghanoush, an eggplant dip, but the pureed mixture was not as good hummus.  Usually a Greek salad is chock full of feta and veggies - this was not!

Our unfriendly  and abrupt waiter was a minus!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials!   I always get the Chicken Caprese Pita with a side salad which is only around $6.50 including tax.  The food is consistently tasty and they have a solid menu.  They also have a full bar and a nice patio area outside. 

Sometimes the service is slow if you sit down at the tables so I always sit at the bar for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch recently, and was somewhat disappointed. Their online specials are advertised as \"half price appetizers\", and \"$3.00 appetizers\". Well, neither one of those advertisements is true. Their \"special half priced appetizers\" are half the size. That's correct, you read that right. It is one of the absolute stupidest things I have ever seen from a restaurant. Half price, for half the size...you do the math. And there apparently aren't any $3.00 appetizers (would those be a third the normal size if they existed?!). And in the same misrepresenting fashion, my falafal sandwich was not much of a lunch special bargain either, as it turns out...it is normally $7.00, and is advertised for $5.00 for the special. Sounds good, right? Wrong! It normally comes with fries, or a salad, but does not on the special. So ridiculous!!!!  The food was decent, nothing to get overly excited about. And our waittress was nice, and did a good job. But between the false advertising, the warm temperature inside (they keep the doors open, it's awful), the flys buzzing around (again, open doors), and the fact that you have to pay to park on Mill ave now...forget it. If you want some similar fare, that tastes better, and costs less, hit up HAJI BABA on Apache (yes, I realize Haji Baba isn't a Greek restaurant)."}
{"text":"OPA! Five stars for this Greek Eatery! 

I never knew I liked Greek food until I tried My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. I was brought her once by a friend, and after sampling her Tryopita I was in LOVE! Tryopita is a baked pita with three kinds of Greek cheese in side. The tyropita as well as most of the Greek items comes with tasty steamed  vegetables, citrus race, and Greek spiced potatoes. Another great thing about this Mediterranean spot is they offer some American choices as well. So don't be afraid to give it a try! Also My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is open for lunch offering some steals on lunch pitas that come with Greek salads. If it's cool enough eat on their beautiful patio covered in little lights that are grapes!"}
{"text":"It sang to us its beautiful lullaby before we spotted it- a lovely waterfall at the restaurant's entrance!  It was a little chilly that evening and I had a feeling that Mamang wouldn't be open to dining al fresco, but I asked for patio seating.  When I spotted a few heaters in place, I knew we'd be fine.  What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.

We shared flaming saganaki, \"award-winning\" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful evening (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she's happier back home... Mamang, next time you're enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you'll think of me!  I'll be there in spirit sipping on another next to you :)

1st con: Poor lighting.  Firstly, my eyes can't feast on the beauty that I'm about to savor.  Secondly, photos taken will most likely be ruined.  Thankfully, my cousin's digital cam had better flash.  Please refer to photos above!

2nd con: Lackluster service.  Appetizer was served, yet we didn't have any utensils on our table.  Couldn't find our server, so I grabbed three sets from a nearby table.  Also, we almost missed the flame shows of both saganaki AND galaktoboureka.  Cousin and grandma thought something or someone caught on fire, haha (in the event of a body, not so funny); Presenter should've given us warning before setting the cheese on fire.  

3rd con: Restroom was in an awful state of disarray.  Counter was wet all over, and the floor was littered with paper.  Total 180 degrees from the awesome ambience experienced on the patio (excluding the poor lighting, of course)."}
{"text":"08/11/10

It's a chain, I know, but what can I say?  I've eaten here three or more times now to know that the food's consistently good!!  Mom still asks me to take her here when she's craving for a great salad :)  I think I'll take her here the next time she feels like dining out...

Today I tried the falafel wrap, which also came w/ a great portion of a side salad.  Mmm... the salad dressing was fantastic!  The size of the falafel patties were grander in size than most of the others I've tried, and, more signifcantly, these weren't greasy or mushy, which could easily have been the case due to the servings' size.  The pita was slathered w/ hummus and topped w/ lettuce, onions, and the tasty falafel, and your traditional Greek salad (lettuce, olives, onion, tomato, and feta).  And all for a great price, under $8!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with four adults  and four kids.  Kids meals were pretty standard. Dad got a Greek salad. Any real Greek place will have a salad with  romaine lettuce, purple onions, Kalamata olives, and a light vinaigrette. This salad had none of that- iceberg, yellow onion,, no olives,and a thick dressing. The falafel was so hard it was like a hockey puck. Also, it tasted horrible. I wouldn't ever come here again.... You have to have good food that tastes good and this place does not have that."}
{"text":"Good solid Greek restaurant in the Westgate area. I've been here several times and have always had good service and good food. I'm fond of the Greek pita with Greek fries. That's all I've ever had but I'd like to try something else next time and I will update my review. As for now a solid 3 star in my book."}
{"text":"Adorable decor, gigantic portion, freshly delicious Greek food. Let my pictures tell the story.:)."}
{"text":"We were here for 3 hours: not by choice, but because it took our server that long to take our orders, deliver our drinks, bring our food, hand us our check, and take our money. 

In that time, I got to eat dried out chicken and luke warm french fries and drink a flat soda. Not only that, but we had no silverware, so I had to personally get up and retrieve forks, straws, and napkins for us to all use. 

I didn't know I had a second career in waitressing. It sucks."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Greek food, I highly recommend this place. The food is cheap and tastes excellent (I definitely recommend the Aegean Club with the salad, and some sun dried tomato hummus!). Plus my most recent service experience was definitely one to remember as I visited with two people who had never eaten there before, our waiter was very knowledgeable, friendly and very accommodating to my guest's need for an MSG free food item. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New menu. No longer My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. Lots of changes. Several favorites are gone. Will write more after checking out the food.

Ordered beef & chicken slovaki. Beef was not as tender. Had lots of cooked zuccini, some lemon potatos & 3 pita slices. Chicken was good."}
{"text":"I don't understand why restaurants can invest in filtered water. The water at this venue is terrible. They use the syrup and Tea to cover up the taste and smell. Ultimately drinking it is not good for your body. Guys and investment in filtering your water will increase the quality of the experience your customers have."}
{"text":"Gyro Pita + greek salad for $7 at lunch is my usual fare when I go. The greek fries are pretty amazing and the baklava is awesome too.  If you notice, there is a 20% off your next visit at the bottom of your receipt which is one of the many reasons that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"The gyros and fries are the best thing on the menu and a great value (especially during lunch). However, the service is absent, but the kitchen is fast. Today the server didn't write down our order and he got it wrong. He also said he would fill my water twice and never did. The floor/grout needs a serious cleaning. Overall, a good place for a decent lunch at a decent price."}
{"text":"They're closed!!  Went to go have lunch there today, door was locked, looked inside and it was empty.  Hoping they're opening somewhere else in the area, but no note on the door.  Very sad..."}
{"text":"Average service, and average food.....Not much more to say.  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is really  trying to establish itself as a chain in every major city and it is really evident by my experience.  When i enter restaurants i either am saying this is going to be a good time or i am not saying anything.  I didn't say much while in MBFGR, except for don't put me at the table covered in crumbs.  To be honest the food was fine.  Good to a degree but as much as i expected being the type of restaurant it is.   The service could have been a little better.  If your looking for an average time and meal nothing special. Try HERE"}
{"text":"The service in the place is AWFUL. It looks like none of the servers want to be there and none of them care. It took forever for me to order and finally when I did,  I ordered a gyro platter and it was horrible.The gyro meat is very dry. Then it took forever to get my check. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THE PLACE EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Every meal here has been great, fun and basically affordable. Staff is nice, food is good and experience is satisfying. I highly recommend this nice place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since the new owners took over. There is no bar tender.I was there tonight and only about 5 people where there . I do not know how they stay open.The name is not the same anymore. It is My Greek Restaurant.The people that work at the restaurant are all very nice."}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are a steal! For $5.95 you have several different options to choose from, including gyros, chicken pitas, and an all-you-can-eat salad and soup option. I chose the salad and soup and one plate was more than enough since they pile on the portions!

The choices today were avgolemono or lentil soup, and Greek or Caesar salad. I went with the avgolemono (chicken lemon) soup and the Greek salad. The soup was very thick and hearty, with a strong lemon flavor, packed with rice. I could taste small bits of chicken in the soup, but after a while, I got tired of the strong lemon taste. The Greek salad was very nice. It was lightly dressed, and had lots of toppings such as (feta?) cheese, with a single olive on top.

Service was good, and our fountain drinks came in a gigantic plastic cup. We came as a party of 5 and they had no problem doing separate checks for each of us. I'll definitely stop by here again for more cheap eats for lunch!"}
{"text":"No bueno. The food here was not that good and the options were limited. I ordered something and they were out of it which forced me to eat something I didn't want. The bruschetta was pretty good but not worth the price. Only came here for the coupon and won't come back. The place seem a little dirty."}
{"text":"My review of My Big Fat Greek Restaurant may be somewhat skewed because I didn't order the Greek items on the menu that others have reviewed. I went with a friend from work and we each ordered a calzone. Really it isn't that difficult to make a good calzone. I ordered the white pizza calzone and while it was descent, there wasn't anything spectacular that stood out. The outer edges were a bit dry, but it improved once I really got into the pie. My friend ordered the Mediterranian calzone and topped it with a side of marinara (to avoid  the dryness). I had a bite and it was good. 

We ordered a slice of baklava cheesecake for the road. I think the mistake was not eating it there. By the time we made it back to the office and actually ate it later in the afternoon, it wasn't as good as it would have been upon first presentation. Added to that, my friend tried to split it in half and ended up mangling the portion, so the visual appeal was not there.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the server was very prompt and courteous. I did think that for lunch it was perhaps a little more than a lunch should be. The cheese cake was $5.95 for the slice. The cheesecake, the white pizza calzone and water with lemon was just over $17. With tip I shot my whole $20 on lunch. 
I wouldn't mind going back and maybe trying something a little more Greek related. But for a calzone, I would find other alternatives."}
{"text":"Greek salad had only ONE olive, no feta and honey mustard dressing!  Very bland food over all. Souvlaki served with less than one pita- odd. Will not be back."}
{"text":"For the price,  I would have liked a little more atmosphere.  As it is, it is simply an American designed Restaurant with a Greek name that serves adequate Greek food.  Plenty of food at a reasonable price.  I went there expecting a taste of Greece, with Greek paintings and other furnishings but disappointed to see it was a very modern American setting.  At BUCCA DE PEPPA, (not the best Italian Restaurant I have ever eaten at) they at least try to get the atmosphere right.  Here, it was they took a typical American eatery and said \"If we call it Greek, and serve mediocre Greek food, they will come.\"  Their seems to be very little in the way of Greek settings, other than banal, average taped Greek music.  Basically, it is what an American might expect a true Greek Restaurant to sound like. 

Having grown up with an Eastern Catholic/Orthodox background, I have been to Greek churches that have served Authentic Greek food and spirits, and MY BIG FAT GREEK RESTAURANT was a BIG FAT DISSAPPOINTMENT. Although the food was good, it was still like eating at an American place trying to do the Greek stuff.  It just does work well. Still, the food was good, and they serve big portions, but for the price, it shuld have been better."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the worst restaurants I've been too. I used to go to the location at Tatum and Cactus which I enjoyed quiet a bit. My son, husband, mother, and I stopped by for lunch on Labor Day. First off the place is tiny, the service is terrible, and the food is decent. It took forever to get any service at all, after which we were seated basically in the doorway, it's silly and uncomfortable. Next we ordered my sons kid meal was brought out about 15 minutes before the rest of our lunch. My mom had a white sangria cocktail which was basically just orange juice, which I have never actually seen anyone put orange juice in white sangria before. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich was basically plain chicken on a bun with a half a head of lettuce, tomato and onion..yep that is really all. The french fries were somehow both burned and undercooked...not sure how that even happens. Finally it came time to pay our bill it came to about $33 which is completely reasonable. I paid with a $50 and was brought my change entirely in ones. This to me is absolutely ridiculous and rude Also I saw the waiter use the money from his wallet (his tips I assume) to make the change which to me is totally unacceptable, you don't bring your wallet out at anytime you're handling customers cash.

Basically you could not pay me to return to this place."}
{"text":"I really like eating here.  I have only been for lunch, and I have found that the service is competent and friendly, and the food comes out FAST.  I've probably eaten at MBFGR five or seven times, and the only time I had a problem was on my last visit, where they served me a plate with cold fries.  This was a mistake, as I had a slight hangover and really, really wanted my gyros pita and fries that day, so I asked for fresh fries.  Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I can't say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries I've ever seen.  They definitely made up for their faux-pas.

I'm a huge fan and will be back many, many times.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Very good combo. Decent options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't had that much of a variety here because once I find something I love, I stick with it. Hands down THE BEST gyro pita I've ever had. It's a mix between lamb and beef and the flavor that explodes in each bite is unreal. Great hummus, the best pita bread I've ever had. Thick and almost buttery in a way. Not thin or cracks apart at all. 

I've had their calamari and that's more like a special treat for me, but it was amazing too. This is the best Greek food I've had, and I know the consistency of flavor and service will be top notch every time I order, which is mostly take out.

Oh yeah, and the Baklava? TO DIE. ;)"}
{"text":"Server dropped the whole glass of water on my wife which left her drenching. We Ordered chicken and vegetable souvlaki, the veggies were raw and uncooked without any flavors. I'd give zero star if possible. When we asked for side of tzatziki to make the vegetables more flavorful, they charged us extra for it. The service was OK after whatever happened. BTW, the restrooms were dirty and smelling horrible I'd recommend some other place or go to Tempe Marketplace nearby."}
{"text":"This restaurant offered a variety of foods but  I didn't feel that \"Greek\" necessarily represented the whole menu. Food was okay. Nothing to rave about. Service was good. Again, nothing to rave about. I'm not sure I would make a point to go back."}
{"text":"I love the Big Fat Greek's lunch menu.  Whenever I go home to Phoenix, I always make sure I eat there.  This new location was a lot nicer than the Chandler Mall location I usually go to, but the food was not as good as the Chandler mall one.  My chicken souvlaki pita chicken was a little dry and the fries were not as good as I am used to having at the other location.  Service was outstanding though!"}
{"text":"Very delightful. Tzatziki was extremely filled with garlic but super tasty! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food isn't too shabby. Am I in a rush to come back? Not really. But would I come back if someone invited me? Sure! 

I got the stuffed peppers and a side of gyro meat. Both could have used more flavor and more heat (temperature)."}
{"text":"Service was pretty fast and friendly.  Would definitely come back.
The Greek fries were pretty good with melted parm and feta cheese. Worth the extra cost.
Nice surrounding with the option to eat outside. 
Really good prices, too."}
{"text":"We came in Wednesday night...we own a motorcycle...and we were dressed in very nice Harley Davidson jackets...we were seated and sat unattended for over 20 minutes...we observed the staff talking amongst themselves, laughing, chatting etc...they never attended to us...we finally got up and left the restaurant and dined at Nick's...had amazing service...and a very nice dinner...we will never return to this restaurant again...and will pass the word of discrimination against motorcycle riders..."}
{"text":"Always loved MBFG!

Me and my date went here before the Michael Buble concert last night. We arrived about half an hour early from the light rail and were quickly accommodated since the place was pretty empty. The food and drinks were great (we both had a pita (gyro and chicken souvlaki), the hummus trio, greek fries, martinis, and the flaming baklaval -- which is DELISH). Anyways, yes, great food, waitress not so great. She would disappear for long periods of time, but I think there were a few managers on hand who quickly stepped in to take care of us. 

Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We were planning to eat elsewhere before but since they were full, we decided to eat at MBGFR. We were seated right away and our server was very nice and attentive. We started off with the hummus (I think jalapeno) and then each got our own chicken souvlaki pita. Everything was A-OK and I'll probably return."}
{"text":"We have dined here twice and both times were impressed.  The Aegean Club sandwich is HUGE with ample portions of chicken, gyro meat, and bacon.  Comes with a ton of fries & I couldn't finish but half of it.  The second time my wife and I both ordered the Gyro plate.  It was excellent.  The only negative was they didn't serve enough pita bread to go with it & we had to ask for more.  The $25 Restaurant.com coupon we used also made for an inexpensive night out.  The atmosphere is fun & service was great, also."}
{"text":"I love that this location participates in the Restaurant.com deals! My husband and I get the $25 gift certificate for $2 and go every month or so. 9 out of 10 times the service is perfect! Every once in a while we catch them on a bad night, but the service the other times makes up for it! The employees are super friendly and kind. We tend to sit on the patio in the nice weather and have only once been forgotten by the waiter. That is a very good track record in my opinion, as we go there quite a bit!

The drink prices are amazing! My drinks always taste exactly as I am expecting, they are very consistent. They do not skimp on the alcohol, I love it.

I would recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in the Arizona Center that's worth a visit.  Good solid Greek food, nice hummus plates, delicious lamb chops ... perfect!  They even do a good calzone.  This is my go-to place for a good lunch downtown."}
{"text":"The gryo was delicious, and our server harry was awesome !! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Greek food. The meat platter here is delicious. I think my favorite thing on the menu is the gyro pita with sweet potato fries though. Its great for lunch or dinner! 

That being said, the service at this place has gone downhill pretty drastically in recent months. Our last visit we had a terrible waitress. We tend to eat fairly early so the restaurant was not very full. However, our waitress forgot our appetizer (we finally got a luke warm, burned appetizer half way through our meal), she left our drink cups empty, and we had to ask for an extra pita three times before she finally brought it. Sadly, it seems the service at this specific restaurant is failing."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Service. Nice and clean Greek food eating experience. If I wanted to improve something It might be the deserts. I'm not saying they are bad. But I have tasted better ones elsewhere in the Valley."}
{"text":"Disgusting ! Look what I just found in my salad I am so grossed out.... I come here a lot but this was the end of it ! I can't even imagine if I had eaten that thing. Literally disgusting"}
{"text":"Crappy chain resturaunt.. Crappy and annoying. Crappy souvlaki, crappy falafel that always hurts my tummy afterwards. Crappy music they torture me with. I'm amazed this place gets so many positive reviews. It must be from the same people that rate Olive Garden as authentic delicious Italian. Go opa yourself."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. Probably the best and most consistent food in Mill ave. tons of specials every day. If you haven't come into the Greek since it reopened you need to"}
{"text":"Great Greek food!  The gyro was excellent and the Greek fries were awesome. Their bar beverages were tasty as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I disagree on this one. I say 3 stars, he says 4. I took into account the value, service, taste and atmosphere and a couple things were lacking. First, service. It took forever to take our order, get our drinks, etc. There were 5 of us and we ordered the hummus trio which was tiny. There were about 2 spoonfuls of each hummus and 2 sliced pita bread. Value was not great for what we got. However, I had the avgolemono soup and it was freaking delicious. My husband had the Pastitsio and adored it. Only it was made with ziti instead of the claimed macaroni. He also loves the gyros there which is why he gives it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service was so slow. The pita bread is fluffy and soft with a mild flavor. The hummus is decent. The gyro is dry and off putting. The salmon I ordered was raw and fishy in flavor. The drinks are extremely large. The best part of the Greek meal was the French fries. They were delicious.
A party next to us ordered some flaming cheese dish which smoked up the whole restaurant.
We ate our food in a burnt cheese haze..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was a complete doll. Very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I gave 4 stars due to two things. First, although my calamari appetizer was delicious and my gyro pita the same, I don't like finding broken toothpicks in with the cucumber (yes, I had already pulled the other ones out completely). Second, my father's blackened salmon was waaay overcooked. I understand one usually doesn't go to a Greek restaurant to order blackened salmon, but cooking fish is pretty basic. In the restaurant's defense the waitress was extremely apologetic and offered to bring him a new plate, but he declined. I didn't mention my toothpick to her, since otherwise the food was delish.

Still the best Greek food I've had in a long time and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"For an early lunch around one this place was near empty. Our waitress took her sweet time and the greek salad was drenched in dressing, other than that the rest of the food was great. Prices are higher than some chains, but cheap for this part of town.

I don't understand how they can charge $5 for a bowl of soup, and then $4 for a cup? You'd think it'd be a bigger difference."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Was opening week, so understandably a little chaotic.  We hope that this location makes it, as it gives us a good neighborhood option to meet friends that isn't a sports bar!"}
{"text":"My review is for the server Kate,  not the restaurant itself.  The food was great, but Kate failed to explain the pricing for a specific menu item.  The price on the menu was not the price I paid, it was double.  Not sure I'd return after that."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing tonight
I had the chicken Alfredo and it was really good
It came with some pieces of bread which were nice and fluffy... And not greasy at all


The Greek blue moon was nice too... Blue moon mixed with peach schnapps and OJ
Fruity and crisp

What made the entire experience great was the service... From our server Andrew... And everyone else who worked in MBFGR. It was so different compared to every other restaurant on Mill... It was just so laid back and everyone was nice! Everyone made sure our visit enjoyable so we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"some of the other reviews of this place are harsh..\"I didn't get sick\" when that's the best you can say about a Restaurant your in trouble...

wow a Restaurant named after a movie how novel...

My Big fat Greek restaurant... I would assume have Greek food... 

What it has Greek in the title but no Baba ghanoush? false advertising... 

the Mucosa was played by vegetarian lasagna and nothing that I expected.

wait there is Ozo and it was good... and the pita might be some of the best I've had. the Hummus was pretty good...

Baklava on steroids? with ice cream? really good... but not what I was expecting...

MB FGR is to Greek food what Chilies is to Mexican...

If your looking for more authentic Greek try Crazy Jim's.

it was good just Americanized Greek food... and at least I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Love the lunch pita! And they always take my change in sauce request, no Problem. I would say the drinking water is pretty bad so just ask for extra lemon or Just go for a greek beer."}
{"text":"Nice people,

Great Gyros, salads, tzatziki, pitas and the flaming cheese.

I'm there once a week at least for the greek salad with gryo meat and sub the village salad dressing - very tart and oh so yummy.

Casual atmosphere and when we have great weather here sitting outside is most recommended."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this big fat greeks before, and after this mornings hellatious commute in on the 10, I thought maybe I should treat myself to some good food.

I sat in the bar area for a quick bite, since it was just me dining alone.  I was greeted by the bartender, who was more then happy to help me. I sat at the hightop tables versus the bar itself, since I had to make a few phone calls on my lunch hour.

I actually placed my order before I even sat down with the cute young bartender.  It took a few minutes for him to bring me my drink, but my food came quickly, which I liked. I ordered the spinach dip, was was quite tasty.

As I sat on the phone discussing this mornings happenings, the bartender was respectful, and was polite about me being on the phone.  He was attentive, kind and nice.  I liked that.

Knowing that this resturant is in a business district, and that a lot of people are on lunch hour, I think they do a good job of keeping things moving quickly.  Theres nothing worse then getting held up on lunch hour due to poor service.

I would gladly return to this location.  I do have to say, after eating at the other BFG in Chandler near my house last saturday, I do not have any excitement to write about in this post.   No resturant fires, bad dates, or cute fireman to speak of.  But, never say never, right?"}
{"text":"Be sure to try the hummus sampler!  Different flavors that I have never enjoyed before, all really good. 

Loved the outdoor seating, perfect for a sunny, spring day!

I tried a lamb dish...silver skin was not removed before cooking = WAY TO TOUGH TO EAT!  Others in my party really enjoyed their food.  I would give it another try...just stay away from the lamb.  Sides were good."}
{"text":"This place has awful food.  Every dish was so salty we could not eat it.  The appetizer (calamari) was also too salty to eat.  We will never go back again."}
{"text":"So very disappointed. We have enjoyed this restaurant so much in the past. We attempted to dine here two weeks ago, but after waiting at the hostess table for more than 5 minutes without anyone arriving to acknowledge our existence, we walked out. Last night, we thought we would give them another chance. We were hopeful when we were greeted and seated fairly quickly. After that.....nothing. No waitstaff ever approached our table or even made eye contact to let us know they knew we were there. We waited 10 more minutes and left, again. Now, after reading the recent comments I can see we were not alone in this major disappointment. I hadn't realized they were under new management or had changed the name to My Greek Restaurant. I give them 3 months, and then I am sure I will see an empty building. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Everything is HUGE there... The drinks, the food, the people!  I love the place and food is good.  The reason for only 4 stars is because it just gets old to go there after a while, there isn't anything special about the place that would want you to keep coming back!  The service is good but nothing over the top... Good place but nothing spectacular"}
{"text":"Took my daughter tonight for her birthday.  Well where to start  we never ate, menu items not available on drink menu, server never came to table, never welcomed,  we stood a long time at door waiting to be sat, 6 filthy tables no one was bussing, we drank our tea and left, left cash at front no one ever came to collect my check. Service poor.  7 pm friday night and almost no staff in site."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food and good service. I had the chicken souvlaki pita with Greek salad and both were very good.  My friend had the gyro wrap and fries and said it was also delicious. I also had the baklava cheesecake and it was definitely an unusual dessert, but extremely delicious. Lastly, you can't go wrong with the check-in deal!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. This restaurant location is NOW PERMANENTLY CLOSED!!!

Open three weeks ago...now closed. Empty. Dark. Closed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this has no reviews yet... perhaps there's another entry for it. Anyway, I think this chain has fairly consistent food and even more consistent service... both range from decent to excellent. I have to admit that the Tempe Mill Avenue location is better, but this place is good as well. The portions are large, so show up hungry. If you are having soda or water with your meal, expect a gigantic 64 oz glass to drink from. It's ridiculous, but I'll admit that I've had a refill here. 

Prices are fairly reasonable for a mid-upper scale chain restaurant. The food is tasty and typically good. The service is usually really good as well. I can't see a reason to give it a bad review. It's definitely not Mediterranean food for foodies.. it's more for casual diners or the uninitiated. They have good hummus and pitas, but it's basically just another American restaurant with a slight Mediterranean accent. Very accessible.

This place barely earns a 4.

Edit: ok, I found the entry for this place on yelp by looking at a map of the area and local places... I just did a search and found the other entry for this place (don't know why yelp does this). So there were other reviews for this restaurant already."}
{"text":"I like the setup and atmosphere. Good service, no long wait for the food, lots of good drink choices but the food is just okay. Good recipe ideas and plate presentations but lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes and the service was very good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar. Awesome happy hour deals and the service was great. Nice clean restrooms. Awesome patio.....Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"The patsitsio was amazing!

Roasted red potatoes and rice pilaf with a pasta dish may be starch overkill, but to it's all good!

The hummus was delicious, with a nice bite to it.

I love sitting on the patio and people-watching the folks on Mill Ave. stroll by.

Don't get down to Mill a lot, but when I do, I try to get some Opa!"}
{"text":"The food is great!  very authentic, especially the starters (Humus, tseziki, dolmades...). They have a plate with all kind of starters that is very delicious!!!
We came back the day after and had Musaka that was very tasty

They don't have  sophisticated place, but if you are looking for great and tasty Greek food - this is definitely the place"}
{"text":"We were greeted and sat right away by a very gracious man host...the waitress was very sweet, but that's it.

It wasn't even busy and this gal was the ONLY Food Server waiting on tables and the \"gracious\" man was assisting...still resulting in SLOW service. UGH! 

Why bother having a dude standing on the corner spinning a sign to bring in MORE people if a place can't handle the existing diners?

Add to this a trio of HIGH MAINTENANCE old people who suck up any time or service for other patrons in the place. So inconsiderate!

We had to ask for our hummus appetizer after 10-15 minutes of waiting...maybe they were out picking chickpeas to make the hummus??? I dunno, but HOW long does it take to scoop it into a dish and deliver to a table? 

Hummus was average and pita quarters were soft and fresh.

If it took a long time for the hummus, you can bet that it took even longer for the food to arrive too. If you are on your lunch hour, then you can guarantee that you'll be late to work.

The kitchen was SLOW getting food out, maybe there was just one person cooking back there??? 

Greek salad was a good portion, but the dressing was like bland watered-down mayo, it wasn't even a greek yogurt based dressing. The grilled chicken was so salty, like it was soaking in a salt bath for days. 

Did we have to ask for the check? Yes.

Were there still dirty dishes on the table after we asked for the check? Yes.

Did it take even longer to pick up the check and run our cc? Yes.

OVERALL SUMMARY: SLOW, slow, but friendly service and average food."}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area for a couple weeks... I'm a big fan of Greek food and this was my first visit to a MBFGR. This one is in Westgate but it wasn't busy on a rainy Tuesday evening. 

First, the service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly, efficient and knowledgable about the menu. The portions were LARGE. Be prepared to take food home if you're not super hungry. I had the Greek salad, which would've been better if it'd been dressed with an olive oil/vinegar dressing instead of what seemed to be a creamy, mayo-based one. Tried my sister's gyro sandwich, which was excellent! The meat wasn't greasy and was perfectly spiced. 

The prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

All in all, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The food has good flavor, and the portions are decent - their gyro cobb salad is big enough to share! Prices vary in terms of what I think are fair or reasonable. The salad I mentioned is $10 and very big, the gyro wraps with (very good) fries are around $8. But drinks (even soda) are too expensive, and add-ons are a rip off. I ordered a side of feta, which was 2oz, and I was charged $2 for it. I paid it since I didn't ask, but that's a bit much for some cheese!

Regarding service, we haven't had problems in the restaurant, but I was dissatisfied with takeout. I was brushed off and pointed to the bar when I arrived, and there was nobody at the bar. A waitress counting her tips avoided eye contact until I interrupted her and asked her to call someone over for me. Meanwhile, the bartender arrive and pulls my food from a counter behind him, where it was sitting getting cold (there aren't hot lamps in the kitchen?). I'll only return for dine-in service.

Lastly, the locations in the Phoenix area are owned by different franchisees, so not all menu options are available at all locations. Just beware if you love a certain item from one!"}
{"text":"A Groupon got us here as it is a bit out of the way. We came here for my mother's birthday. 
Nice atmosphere and good food. The service was good as well. Very friendly and attentive server. They sang for my mother. She really enjoyed that.

I would return with or without a Groupon."}
{"text":"After a full day of Phoenix Comicon, my party of three was famished and in need of sustenance. My Big Fat Greek Restaurant didn't have a long line or crowds at 8:45pm. We were seated on the patio. It was dark so we couldn't see the garden, but the vibe was lovely and the misters made the temperature perfect.

We ordered a variety of sides to share: calamari, flaming saganaki cheese, tzatziki with pita, and bruschetta. I have to say, it was all quite good. Calamari isn't my thing but I tried some and the texture was just right. The flaming cheese was fabulous! The pita hit the spot, too, though I have had better. The tzatziki sauce had a nice, cool flavor. The biggest surprise was the bruschetta. I tend to not like it because many places use hard bread. Here, it was soft and toasted, and the flavors were excellent.

Our biggest issue was the lack of service. Our food was delivered (with one wrong thing brought out and taken away) and then our waitress vanished from the patio. We could see her inside the restaurant as she chatted with co-workers. Not cool. We understood it was near the end of her shift--heck, we were run down by a long day as well--but it's like she forgot we were there. Just when I was about to go inside to ask for the check, she came out and we waved her over.

Overall, good food and a nice environment. I wouldn't mind eating at this restaurant again or another location, but if I was burned on service again, that would be it for me."}
{"text":"It was good and decent pricing. It's very large in there so it looks like lots of family like to come in after church. We were seated quickly and the server was fast. He always kept my glass full!

I had the chicken kabobs with vegetables and rice. The vegetables were well prepared with zucchini cauliflower carrots squash and broccoli. I didn't like the rice so much. I was hoping for like a bismati type rice. 

The chicken kabob was good and moist. It was a decent size serving and leaves you feeling full. Check in with yelp right now and get a 10 dollar coupon off 25 dollars. How great is that?

The table next to us ordered the Greek salad on the side and it looked really colorful and phenomenal... I would consider that next time."}
{"text":"I thought the service was good. I wanted to try the food that other yelpers recommended so I had the flaming feta which I HIGHLY recommend. I was surprised when she lit it on fire. It was very tasty. Good if you have a salt tooth. Also had the greek fries, they were good as well. The baklava cheese cake was delicious. I would return here for more items in the future."}
{"text":"Hmm, 5 diners at the restaurant, 5 servers.
5 servers sitting at a table by the door chatting... No service.

Sort of a Denny's of Greek Food. Food lacked something... All the parts were there, but the magic of Greek Food was missing.  Food Court Greek?

Gyro meet is good, service Hilarious... l thought we were being punked ;)"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but the last few times I was there, I was completely disgusted.  You ask why did I go back?  Well, I decided to give them another chance since a) I had a Groupon and b) it's the closest Greek place to me and I was craving Greek food.  Anyway, big mistake.  They must have changed owners or something recently, because the place just isn't the same.  

1) Iced tea came with a hair on the orange garnish - great start!
2) When I asked the waitress to deconstruct my daughter's gyro sandwich, she hesitated, said the kitchen couldn't do it, and put up a stink.  She finally offered us a compromise, but it suited her/them, more than it suited us.  Heck, she's 9 years old and all we asked for was to put the meat, sauce and pita separately on the dish.  Really?  Too hard for the kitchen to do?
3) The gyro meat was cold and completely dried out.
4) The French fries are home made and could have been good, if they weren't reheated.
5) The gyro meat that did come inside my daughter's sandwich was enough to feed a bird.
6) My salad came with barely any dressing on it.
7) My pork souvlaki had 4 small cubes of meat in it.
8) The tzatziki that came with both of our sandwiches was barely enough to fill half of those little silver cups.  
9) I asked for extra onions for my sandwich and they wanted to charge me.  For onions?  Seriously? I declined.  I then asked to get my daughter's onions and they obliged, and it was still just a few small chopped pieces.  I asked where the extra onions were, and she said those were it.  I said then where are mine, and she pointed inside my sandwich to show me the 2 petite slices, (if you can call them that) of onion.  If her finger slipped slightly, it would have been inside my sandwich.  They were still invisible.
10) I asked to see the manager and complained about these issues.  He was nice enough to agree with what I complained about and offered to bring out more gyro meat, salad dressing, tzatziki and onions.  This certainly helped, but you shouldn't have to ask for what made up a normal portion, barely.  He sent the waitress over with these extras and he never came back to see how everything was.
11)  The passion fruit iced tea was tasteless.  Basically, it seems as if they are skimping on everything and if you have to limit the amount of tea bags you put into a jug of water, then things must be really bad.

And that about sums it up.  I'll never go there again and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  If you order the falafel pita, fries or a salad and a drink between 11am and 4pm, it will only cost you around $7-8...not bad, not bad. 
The flaming saganaki cheese with the warm pitas is really good too and you'll notice that pretty much every table will order one.  
They have quite a few vegetarian friendly options, including some really tasty dips, spanakopita and dolmades.  
My friend got a chicken pita when we were there and loved that, but that's the only meat item I can vouch for.  
This location is fun too, because it's right in old town and easily accessible to all of the bars and clubs nearby."}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright but that I've definitely had better. I tried their gyro with greek fries and it was good (you could see them carving it) but I have experienced better & after a little the fries were a little much."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are already drunk! They will take advantage of you!

A couple weeks ago, my husband and I did a Mill Ave pub crawl. This was stop #3 (I know - it's not really a \"pub\"! - blah blah blah!) - we wanted a couple appetizers and a couple shots of ouzo.

I should have known I was too drunk to be around big fat Greek restaurant waitresses (BFGRW) when the waitress started caressing my arm while I ordered cocktails, and I didn't pull away. That's just a bad start.

We ordered feta and olives and a *small* greek salad. The Feta and olive plate should be called 'feta plate w/ olive garnish' - there were only 8 olives on the entire huge plate. When I tried to articulate this, the BFGRW wanted to sell me more olives! I was too drunk to explain that the plate didn't actually have enough to begin with, so we let it go and didn't order any more. The *small* greek salad was interpreted by the BFGRW as the \"large\" greek salad - she obviously realized she could have her way with us. We also ordered their flight of cocktails - I would not recommend this - it tasted like gummy bears in three flavors. 

Mrs Big Fat Greek Restaurant Waitress - I may have been too drunk to defend myself, but I remember everything! You will not be a stop on our next Mill Ave pub crawl!"}
{"text":"This place is a fav now.  This was our first visit and last outing during my most recent visit to AZ.  My sister and I like the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix, for lunch and shopping.  The chalkboard advertising Sangria for happy hour really caught our eye.  It's HAPPY HOUR!!  

Great selection of appetizers (Opa...tizers  hehehe) for $4.  Red and white sangria made to order and other drink specials.  The service was super friendly and welcoming.  I can't believe there was no one there on a Friday at 4:30pm during happy hour.  This place is a gem! 

The Saganki was great, the service was great, the drinks were the best. Check them out."}
{"text":"Three (more like 6!) strikes, you're out MBFGR! I have given you every opportunity I can think of to correct your mistakes, and you continue to disappoint me every time I visit. Explain to me like I am a 3 yr. old, why, if the place is empty, and servers are standing around looking for something to do, and I am the first guest to arrive, that it should take a 1/2 hr. to prepare a burger? I'll answer my own ?. Because like everything else, you did not pay attention to what you were doing. I ordered a burger, (simplest thing on the menu!) MEDIUM. Not burnt to a crisp with every last drop of flavor charbroiled out of it. Why can't you get this right?! What is the problem? Ask me, I'll show you how to do it, if that's what it's going to take! For crying out loud, this place just cannot seem to get their S*** together! Evidenced by how EMPTY the place remains all throughout the week, even during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Yay!  This place knows what it's doing.  It's slightly cheesy, with the canned greek music and the painted indoor frescos.  But the restaurant embraces its own qualities and it really works.  The service is great, the food was delicious! and the tumblers are gi-normous, which means you never ask for a refill.  

My friends and I ordered the sun-dried tomato hummus dip with pita wedges.  My mouth is still watering.  The pita was toasted and buttered and so flaky and delicious.  The only problem is that there wasn't enough pita to cover all the hummus.  Solution:  50 cent refills of pita!!

Then we had the gyro sandwich platter, the vegetable moussaka, and the \"famous\" gyro dinner.

um... YUM.

The french fries are the thin-sliced, crispy kind (which I love).  The greek salad is p.e.r.f.e.c.t.  The platter came with rice, pita, enormous amounts of meat, steamed veggies, and tzaziki sauce.  The moussaka was also great.

And, although I'm a girl, in the interest of full-disclosure.. I don't think I've ever seen more gorgeous waitresses in shorter shorts."}
{"text":"I ordered the Peach Iced-Tea, Beef and Lamb Souvlaki (skewers), Greek Salad and Baklava Cheesecake for a grand total of $28.31 (wow)!  Now, the Greek Salad was very tasty until I bit into something that didn't belong (something quite bitter, couldn't place the taste)....  Weird....  Then later that night back at the hotel, I found a piece of spinach in my Baklava Cheesecake... Ugh.... There's no way it could have came from my salad because I had the cheesecake boxed up to go from the kitchen.  

The Souvlaki was awesome.  The meat seasoned well, and quite yummy.  The cheesecake was a bit too rich for me...too much cheesecake and too much baklava.  It wasn't blended together just simply baklava sitting on top of a cheesecake.  The pita bread was the best I've tasted.  

Somethings were truly  hit and missed here!"}
{"text":"We have been occasional patrons of My Big Fat Greek, but this location outdoes the rest!

Since these are franchise locations, every one is different with regards to the owners and the way the restaurant is managed. The food here is absolutely mouthwatering and home-made, but above all else the service is the most accommodating we've encountered and is personable and friendly.

It's a small restaurant, unlike some of the other locations, but the atmosphere is warm and inviting. This food is best enjoyed with a group where it can be shared and sampled around the table. Every so often flaming platters are brought out to the tables around the restaurant, which make for an exciting show of fire.

As far as the food, everything reminds us of our home-made meals and everything was moist and tender. If your party likes meat and likes sampling a little bit of everything on the menu, I would recommend trying the meat lover's platter, which needs a minimum of a couple people to order. The price may be steep on this platter, but it is enormous and can feed several people and still leave enough for leftovers.

The prices in general are great, considering the portion sizes, and we are told that the lunch specials are dirt cheap. This is definitely towards the top of our list for Greek and Mediterranean restaurants. The close proximity makes it a fast and easy choice for a last minute dinner."}
{"text":"My first stop in Scottsdale was the fashion mall, and apart from viewing some of the top tottie of the 'Valley' and checking out Barney's for $300 shirts (no thanks) and some of the Italian restaurants there, nothing spectacular.  

Next stop was the olde towne Scottsdale, which looked weak (thank god for rental cars in Phoenix) but around 5th I noticed a Greek joint.  

Unless you live in an igloo in Alaska, you can get Mexican/Southwest whatever anywhere.  Like I said the fashionista Italian joints seemed over the top to me, but I wanted something not burgers and not chili-whatever corona lime margarita.  

This place saved the day (or lunchtime).  The heat of the afternoon met the cool attitude of the place.  I had a greek pasta which was great, my companion had a gyro with a pesto wrap and a greek salad which combined trad greek with contemporary.  Not that pesto wrap is new, but it works, baby.  

They had ouzo shots on special, some overpriced Greek beers (I don't know any Greeks who drink that stuff) but it beats the hell outta the options I found that day."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, having spent 10 days in Crete and Greece a few years ago, where I experienced the real thing.  I only ate here once while attending a nearby conference.  I decided to stick with a gyro rather than something a bit more exotic. If I came for dinner I would be more adventurous.

Let me say, I love gyros, even though they're a bit different in the states than in Greece, where they often put French fries in the middle. I realize that in many ways gyros are to Greek food what Taco Bell is to Sonoran cuisine; still they beat most lunch fare and all fast food, in my opinion.

MBFGR's gyro was excellent. The pita flatbread was thick and chewy and was piled high with thick slices of spicy meat. There was too little tzatziki (on the side) in my opinion, but I love the stuff and that's my issue.  Fries were thin and crispy.

The setting is beautiful, near an open plaza with a fountain. In October the temperature was just right. I imagine that in July it might be a wee bit toasty sitting outdoors.

Service was quick, even though they were quite busy with the lunch crowd. Great lunch under $10 plus tip."}
{"text":"As a real Yelper, gotta say I think some of the 1-stars are b.s... Esp  those with few other reviews or others who say \"go to xxx instead.\" PLEASE.... 
ANYWAY... FANTASTIC Village Salad (horiatiki) - feta chunks, greek olives, etc, no lettuce, real Greece-style. The dressing has red wine vinegar but it doesn't have the stinging bite, absolutely FANTASTIC. Also LOVE the chicken on skewers, tender, flavorful, WONDERFUL. BONUS: SANGRIA ROCKS!! I try it a lot of places & the way thru do it here is Mt favorite style... Strong bite yet sweet. The fettucine Alfredo is GOOD if you like it LIGHT - we do! Not gooey, more milk consistency, nice nutmeg touch to it. FRESH veggies as a side, nice & crisp, sauteed lightly, which is what we prefer.

2nd time here- different chef, we can tell, but just as good!"}
{"text":"My Big Fat Cell Phone...

You're probably asking me what does this mean? Well I went to this place and forgot my big fat Nextel Cell phone on the table, as soon as I realize it, I rush back (10 minutes later max) and the cell phone is no where to be found. I asked the waitress, the hostess, but no one had turned it in. I tried to call it, and it was shut off. What happened you say! The Bus Boy took it! Yes, the damn busboy, stole my big fat cell phone. Ironically I'm glad he did, because I hated that phone and wanted to get a new one, but had no good excuse to buy a phone at that time. 

Food wise, this place is pretty good, and inexpensive. If you like Greek food of course. I consider this the Applebee's of Mediterranean food,  so don't expect to be wow'd with uniqueness, expect consistency and a decent experience. It is grab a  quick lunch here and just relax kind of place. 

This place deserves a 2, but since it was a catalyst to me getting a new cell phone I bumped it up a notch. So all of you people looking to get rid of old technology, bring it t MBFGR, and leave it on your table, the bus boy, just may take it!

(evil laugh)"}
{"text":"The Yelp two star guide says it all, \"Meh, I've experienced better\".

I used to come here on a weekly basis for lunch with coworkers because the location is very convenient and the prices were very reasonable for Old Town Scottsdale.   The food has always just been ok to good, three stars at best, and the service has always been hit or miss.  After going for lunch today, I remembered why we stopped going; the prices really aren't that good anymore and the service really stinks now!  The $6 lunch special ends up costing $12-$13 with a soft drink, making it about the same price as all the other lunch specials around Old Town. 

Service has gone downhill.  Today I had a $10 coupon, which I gave to the waitress before we ordered.  When she brought us the bill she gave the $10 coupon back and said it wasn't valid for use on the lunch specials, of which we ordered three.  You would think she could have mentioned this before we ordered.  As she told us this, I remembered another co-worker had complained about MBFG not honoring coupons several months ago. Even though the coupons fine print did not specify it was not applicable for use with lunch specials I did not challenge the waitress and instead put MBFG (all locations) on the ban list.  So now they lose potentially hundreds of dollars in revenue, because they are being shifty with their $10 coupon. Excellent management!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon and found the place to be pretty empty even though it was prime lunch time. I ordered the salmon which was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. The service was good too and the ambiance was casual. It was a bit pricey for the quality of food we got."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch every now and again. Great gyros and salads, but service has always been really slow here. I guess at lunch it makes sense, it can be kind of busy - but most of the time it really isn't that busy. The manager mostly just sits and watches tv (or maybe he is the owner?) and doesn't check on any of the tables. Have had dirty silverware and glasses on 2 occasions which is never good."}
{"text":"If you want real Greek food, don't eat here. One look at the menu and I was concerned. They had pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches and burgers. The Greek fare was limited to the most popularized dishes. Maybe you could say it's a Greek-inspired menu. They seem to want to cover all the bases. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and this place reinforced that.  If you want a more authentic Greek food experience try Greektown on 7th Street.

This restaurant has been around for years and I know people who think it's great. My brother and his wife eat here regularly and have good things to say about it. So when they invited us to tag along, I thought why not? I should have declined. I am sure I'll never eat here again.

We were immediately turned off because there had been a cigar smoker out on the patio (turns out it was the owner)and since the doors were propped open, you could smell the cigar inside. Gross. We asked to move to another table further away.

The best part of the meal was the calamari appetizer, which was nicely battered and not overcooked. It was served with a marinara sauce and a roumelade sauce. A nice touch perhaps, but that's not Greek. We shared a pitcher of red sangria which was overly sweet and didn't taste like it had much wine in it.

I chose the lamb shanks which were OK but nothing special. They were served with lemon potatoes which were extremely salty and steamed veggies which were pretty limp. This dish also comes with Greek rice but I asked not to get a second starch in lieu of more veggies. If we got more veggies then it was a pretty skimpy portion.
My brother got the gyro platter. The meat looked like leather. I tried a piece and it was dried out and unappetizing. Hey, gyro meat should be one of the best things at a place like this. I cannot recommend this restaurant. 

Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"Wow! I have eaten at many Greek restaurants in the valley. I have to say this has been one of the best yet. Their Gyros taste great and are tender. Not salty like a lot of Greek restaurants. Salad was delicious as for the flaming cheese. The service is pretty good! Very good experience! Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"The only thing I really like about this downtown eatery is the sprawling outside patio. The service and food were definitely sub-par and I doubt I'd ever return for lunch again. 

For starters, the service was ridiculously slow. I understand that it's downtown and it's crowded at lunch but the servers need to be better at managing the lunch crowd. Lunch crowds order less and need to be in and out and any good restaurant in a business-oriented area will be good at that revolving door model. I mean, it's not like we're waiting for hand-rolled sushi or hand-crafted cocktails here. We simply wanted to place our order in a timely fashion, get our sodas and waters quickly and then have our food come out in a reasonable amount of time. None of those things really happened. 

I was also super unimpressed with the food. Being a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish, I was immediately drawn to the baba ganoush. I figured I often have falafel and that it would be nice to try something new and a bit heartier. I realize that that dish is supposed to be a bit mushy (sort of like ratatouille), but it was literally soggy and dripping with oil. The rice on the side was also dry and the bechamel sauce was overwhelming and flavorless. It also really turned me off that I couldn't get it on the side because according to the waiter, it was \"already mixed in.\" I'm all for no substitutions or changes, but not when the food's not actually faster as a result. 

This place is a lot of hype and not a lot of substance and I think your money would be much better spent at more of a hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean joint. If you're feeling like a quick drive down Van Buren, you could even check out Al-Hana, the extremely affordable and delicious eatery inside the Baiz Market."}
{"text":"My husband would give My Big Fat Greek 0 stars, but I'm going to give it 2. We actually used to go to the location in Scottsdale, and we've also been to this location many times. We always enjoyed our meals there.


We didn't have it tonight, but I especially like the Bruschetta. It's a huge portion. I like the grilled foccacia and all that tops it, including tomatoes, basil, hummus and sweet balsamic reduction. It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk. This is the highlight.

On this trip I got a large Greek Salad. I like the creamy type greek dressing.. it's atypical for Greek salad, but I'm into it. I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl. I get a little side of jalepeno cilantro hummus and dip away. 

My husband got chicken and lamb souvlaki tonight. The wooden skewer broke into his lamb so he had to do surgery to remove it. The lamb had gristle, the chicken was under seasoned. The side vegetables were undercooked and cold, and the rice was tepid. 

When the manager came by asking how everything was, my husband gave him the FYI- and he was kind and ordered us a dessert. We declined. My husband was turned off by the chipped plate of his appetizer salad, a cricket crawling along the ground (in all fairness the door to the patio was open), and the light above our table flickering on and off. 

We had a savvy dining coupon for buy one entree get one free and our bill still came to $30. We had to order two drinks to get the coupon. My husband got a Sprite, and I asked for a hot decaf tea. They said they had chamomile, but then came back to tell me that they're out of all decaf teas, so I got an apple juice I didn't drink.

The $30 meal included:
Lamb and Chicken Souvlaki meal with side Greek Salad
Large Greek Salad with ramekin of hummus
Sprite
Apple Juice

We thought it was pricey for a buy one get one deal. The drinks were $3 a piece, so really we just got $3 off of my salad, because if it weren't for the coupon we wouldn't have ordered drinks.

Our waitress was very nice.

Edited: I had to drop it to one star. My husband had serious stomach issues the whole night."}
{"text":"My friend and I were down in Phoenix for a poetry show that night which ended about 10pm.  We hadn't eaten anything since lunch and were on our way to the hotel we were staying at for the night just around the corner from this location.  We wanted to eat prior to checking in- so we stopped in about 10:30pm to grab dinner. 

The restaurant was almost vacant, there were maybe 5 other people eating in the space and a rowdy group of about 10 people at the bar.  The guests- or so we thought- at the bar were quite a distraction- yelling screaming and carrying on.   We know the restaurant must be closing soon so we quickly put in our orders- Falafel pitas with Greek Fries- one of their specialties.  

We quickly discovered that the rowdy bar crowd we were seated right in front of was not locals, or a big group of friends watching the game but were off-duty EMPLOYEES of the restaurant who were CLEARLY INTOXICATED.  This could be deduced from them knowing all the staff that was working and who kept going back to the bar to hang out.    

Our food came out fairly quickly and looked and tasted alright.  Right after we started eating an older blonde woman in all black came up to our table and stuck her face less than 6 inches from our plates and began to examine our food.  She didn't touch it- just stared at it perplexed and then asked \"WHAT did you order?!?!?\"- we told her \"Falafel pitas and greek fries\". She scowled and exclaimed \"That's a lot of cholesterol!\" She then went to the table next to ours- who still had people eating at it- and asked if she could get them anything else- because she was a WAITRESS! 

I might add that our waitress was fairly polite and generally just looked like she didn't really want to be there.  

While waiting for our bill- because at this point we really just wanted to leave and go to our hotel- the phone rang- the hostess told one of the bar crowd members that she had a call.  She ran to the hostess station to take it- immediately started using loud profanities and talking about how she didn't want to go to her \"babies daddy's house tonight\".  This went on for several minutes.  At one point the manager came out and asked her to quiet down- she was nearly shouting- but didn't ask her to take the call elsewhere.  

Needless to say we paid quickly and RAN out the door. 

Later that night we were both up vomiting- more than likely from food poisoning. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant ever again. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"I visited this venue looking for quick lunch and a gyro was what was on my mind. I was greeted quickly upon entry to a vacant restaurant. Not sure if this was a good sign or just a slow period of the day. The venue looks nice, was clean, and a little bit confusing. Greek restaurant over powered by Skyy Vodka??? Say what? Moreover, and although a cold mixed drink would have nice....lunch time was my target. Also, I was searching for a nice new venue to visit during my lunch break, etc.  Now here comes the low down.....a 5 dollar lunch menu...sweet! Until I got my gyro and fries....thats where it went down hill. For 5 bucks a gyro should be filled with meat, lettuce and whatever the white sauce was. Instead I got a gyro with 3 - 2 inch long strips of meat....wtf? The fries (which were an additional 99 cents extra) were nice and crispy. That gyro was damn pitiful and for that this place gets 2 stars. Lets get some more meat on them and Ill reconsider....for now consider this to be continued!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and so was the service. The food came out super fast and was expertly prepared. Tangy and oh-so-delicious. I had a Greek salad with gyro meat added and loved it.  I also loved that the sodas came in great big glasses. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are in town for the weekend and found this place at Arizona Center.  The food was SO GOOD!  We had the Village Hummus plate and the Pizza Salad.  The staff was friendly and attentive as well.  I highly recommend it :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone gives this place such terrible reviews, as I find the food here very tasty. The service complaints though, I can understand. It is L-O-U-S-Y! The portions are very generous, and quite inexpensive compared to other Greek establishments. BTW, has anyone found a good Greek place in this city? Much like Sam's Cafe, the patio is the #1 selling point, with the beautiful water features to look at. Overall I like the restaurant, and think the food is pretty decent. I have referred a lot of friends, family, and colleagues here and they always like it as well."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal. I had a gyro with a greek salad. It was a large portion for $9. Everything tasted great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because it was within walking distance of our hotel and we both had flown in earlier in the day from either end of the country and were too tired to go drive somewhere. The food was good and flavorable. We both ordered souvlaki, but different types. The wait person informed us we could mix and match the different types even though the prices were different. We enjoyed that suggestion and ordered one stick of what we wanted and one stick of shrimp. I ordered the lamb. Both types were very flavorable. My boss had a beer and was surprised at the size of the glass. I had water (diabetic). It was unfiltered tap water and had the aftertaste I remembered from the time I lived in the valley. It would be great if they put a filter on the tap to get the minerals out of the water. My boss had the Greek salad and said they didn't miss anything there. I had the avgolemeno soup. It was good, but not as creamy as others I have had. We also shared the saganaki. It was flavorable and wonderful to eat. The only down side was the waitperson who brought it (not our regular waitperson) did a hurried lighting ceremony while standing behind me and without warning, so I missed half of it. They also split our checks, which was a great consideration.

It surprised me to read the other reviews and find out this was a chain restaurant. The food was much better than I usually find in the chains."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill so badly that they have fallen off the cliff!  Husband and I went on a Saturday, the day after Valentines Day. They weren't swamped......but they weren't dead, either.  

Strike #1  hubby asked about beers on tap, was told that they \"are under new management, and ........uh..........the manager is making changes, so we won't have beer on tap.\"  Hmmmmm......okay. 

We ordered the still-running Valentines Special, which started with the hummus trio.

Strike #2 I don't know what that slop was, but it wasn't hummus. None of the trio even vaguely resembled hummus. It did, however, resemble poi. Too bad we weren't in Hawaii.

Salads arrive. I have always loved a good Greek Salad. They're hard to screw up---greens, onions, olives,tomatoes, cukes, lemon juice and EVOO. 

Strike#3 CREAMY salad dressing?? What the --??? This tastes like Ranch Dressing with some feta cheese!

Dinner arrives. The chicken and beef skewers were good. The pork was so-so. The gyros meet was good. The vegetables were overcooked mush suitable for toddlers or people with no teeth. The potatoes were so over-flavored with lemon (and I love lemon) that they made me want to pucker up.

Then our included baklava came. I should maybe disclose the fact that my grandmother was Lebanese, and I learned to make baklava when I was less than 10 years old. I have made and enjoyed all different kinds, flavors, methods, and ethnicities of baklava--some great.....some not so much.  

They should be embarrassed to try and pass that off as baklava. Yia-yias all around the world are turning in their graves as I write this. My own grandmother probably cursed me even eating this. THIS WAS NOT baklava!

They slapped some layers of phyllo dough on a sheet, didn't butter between them, dumped some sludge of honey and chopped walnuts on there, and topped it with more unbuttered phyllo. It was an awful mess. Then, the most absurd part:  they served it on a bed of whipped cream, drizzled with honey. My grandmother will be haunting me in the weeks to come, I am sure.

It's really a shame. My Big Fat Greek is the place that brought Greek food to the Valley, and made it mainstream. They have lost sight of their vision, and are trying be like every other mediocre chain restaurant. We won't ever go again"}
{"text":"Great food. Chicken Parmesan & Garlic Shrimp was amazing!

Logan our waiter was outstanding! 

Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good!!!!! They have a great selection of hummus. The village hummus (spicy one) is my favorite. Along with the grilled chicken salad. They have a good and sometimes cheap selection of flavored mojitos. I prefer the regular ones but they are all pretty delicious. There aren't too many places on Mill to just go and eat and not get caught with bar food or super greasy food so this is a great change of pace and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Overall a solid value for lunch - The Gyro's here are well done and the hummus is fantastic. Try the plain hummus with diced Jalapeno's on top - Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on mill, but this was a pleasant surprise. I liked the atmosphere and the service was outstanding. I wasn't too adventurous and neither was my girlfriend. We both had the gyros and they were great. The wine was good, as was the calamari appetizer. The other couple dinning with us also enjoyed their food. Would  I go back, of course."}
{"text":"I usually get the gyro here, but it was happy hour so we went with the $5 appetizers. The calamari was good as always, the flaming cheese was decent, and the hummus  was pretty good. Lots of pitas too, most places don't give you enough. The drinks were cheap and tasty, and even though it was right before an ASU football game and was packed, the service was still good. I was upset that my beers were in a plastic cup, but once the crowds cleared out that changed.  Try the Athena draft beer, its great."}
{"text":"Located in the Arizona Center, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was conveniently situated near downtown Phoenix hotels and offered something different from the usual Southwest or American fare in the area. 

I came here on a weekday during happy hour. It was dead in the restaurant. Thankfully, service was friendly and attentive; not slacking despite the slow night. I ordered the gyro platter with greek salad and vegetables. It was a good amount of food. There was plenty of thick, shaved beef/lamb meat on the plate, but the meat tasted bland. Good thing there was two cups of yogurt sauce to dip the meat in! Gotta love sauce. I also wished they gave me a few more pieces of pita bread. With a glass of wine, overall I was satisfied with the meal.

Price: $12 for the gyro platter, $3 happy hour house wine.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. Great place to hang out and enjoy great food. Not to noisy but not a ghost town either. Food portions are very generous and usually we take home left overs."}
{"text":"Close but no cigar....

On the plus side...good portions, food is decent, not great Greek food.  I thought the appetizers were the best - try the Keftedes.  Hummus was pretty good, but it's hummus.  Cheese and olives was more cheese than olives - they should cut back on the cheese a bit and toss in a few more olives.  Saganaki was good.

Who ever heard of a creamy Greek salad dressing?  Very disappointing Greek salad.  Gyro platter was ok - too much rice and potatoes and give me a whole pita please not triangles!  Tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it.

Patio chairs are very uncomfortable and turn the damn TV's off - how about some nice Greek music in the background instead.

Service was ok, friendly but nothing special.

Been there for lunch - a better deal than dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Hair in the food.  Food served in plastic wrappers straight from the microwave.

The appetizer was microwaved in a plastic wrapper and served to us in the plastic wrapper with the hand written label on it.  The plastic was melted but the food was frozen in the middle.  We pushed it aside.

The lamb was cooked in a microwave and dried out ridiculously to the point where it wasn't edible.  It shattered when a fork touched it.

We were seated and 15 minutes later we had water.  We drank it down and never received refills.  The two servers on staff just stood by the bar and did nothing.

I'm not picky on food.  This place SUCKS!  Too bad, because it's right across the street from work and we all eat at the 6 or so other restaurants that neighbor it.

I could not imagine a worse dining experience without them breaking laws.  From time to time, we joke about how terrible this place is and that somebody must be losing a fortune keeping it open.

I make sure to tell friends and family how bad this place is.  We lost $40 that day."}
{"text":"This review was supposed to be for the location in Phoenix.  I'm trying to delete it."}
{"text":"this place is now closed and moved to a new location in glendale"}
{"text":"Well, I see tons of reviews with little to no stars, but I've eaten here three times and the food was really good each time! Yes, the ambiance isn't 5-star (with the dusty fake greenery and dated tile throughout, but c'mon - it adds charm)! The last time I went, we got the $5 pita lunch specials. A lot of food for a mere $5. My pita (the caprese) was loaded with chicken and the pita was definitely fresh. With an appetizer the bill came to $18! My only complaint is that it took a long time to get our entrees, but otherwise, I'd recommend going."}
{"text":"Came for lunch during the week. The gyro was absolutely delicious! I got the gyro plate and I was definitely very happy with my choice. The wait to get our food was quite long & we began to wonder what was going on. Before we knew it though, the restaurant manager came to our table to apologize to us for our food taking longer than it should have, and he gave each of the 4 of us a $10 off coupon to use on a future visit. We were all very impressed because we hadn't said anything about the wait. The food ended up being well worth the wait & we were all very happy with the manager being proactive like he was."}
{"text":"Great falafel pitas and the Greek Fries are a family favorite!  Great location for the Fall-Winter-Spring as they have decent outdoor seating.

The service is hit or miss; sometimes great, sometimes absent, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food.  The garlic fries are very good and the falafel is solid.  The Mill location is fun as is the location in Chandler."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro + greek fries are my go to here. The lemon sauce they give with the fries is always so yummy! I have yet to eat inside of the restaurant, however, I do order it to go and the food is made fresh and I've never had any issues with the food. This is definitely my favorite place to go to in Tempe for Greek food!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice with my friends and once with my family and the food has been amazing every time. For some odd reason the food always puts my friends and I in a good mood. I've actually been to Greece and I can actually say that the food is up to par with real Greek food. You definitely must check it out and i'll be back again many times."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before.

Saganaki was delivered without Opa!  That is part of the delivery in every Greek restaurant I've been to.

Food not as good as before. Gyro lukewarm, not hot. Fries came crispy just like I ordered. Bread DELICIOUS. 

After food delivered never saw my waitress again. Had to stand at the register to get my bill and even then, she was talking to another worker. 
Why is it so hard to provide good, if not exceptional customer service?

I'll try another Gyros place because this one doesn't seem to want my business."}
{"text":"The worst meal I have eaten this entire year...AND the year is almost over.  8 of us  shared a birthday dinner...5 of us got sick.  I had a lamb dish (u know, greek specialty) and found that most of it was in the toilet by 2am....I then spent the next 30 hours in bed, with no strength due to food poisoning.  O MY food poisoning is not f-u-n.  I give this eating establishment ZERO friggin' stars.  I also need to mention that several friends (after my mentioning this meal and occurence) have said the same thing about this particular location of My BIG fat Greek restaurant.  They too have gotten sick after meals here."}
{"text":"After having been in a few times for nothing more than beers and hummus, I finally had dinner here and it was great! The vegetarian Moussaka was to die for- extremely flavorful and well put together. I'm not really adding anything new by raving about the lemon potatoes and the rice pilaf, but yes, they were awesome too. 

The service was just okay, but I've had worse. I think the waitress got annoyed with me when I asked her if I in fact received the vegetarian moussaka, when I mistook some pieces of veggie for ground beef when she first brought out my dish. I got a snappy \"yes\" and she sort of ignored me for the rest of the night. Regardless, my experience was a good one and I'm sure I'll return."}
{"text":"Good food.  Trio hummus appetizer was very good.  We shared the meat lovers platter.  Due to experience we ordered for two but there were four of us.  It was still a silly amount of food.  Great atmosphere.   Fun part of town."}
{"text":"First time here. I stopped in to grab a quick bite. I LOVE gyros. So I ordered one. It was pretty average. Not too busy on a Monday night. Service was pretty average too. Overall, pretty mediocre and I wouldn't come back and pay $9 for subpar gyro."}
{"text":"Very tasty! We had the dolmades, the flaming saganaki, spanokipita, & gyros platter. The bakalava was good, but very cinnamonny. Would recommend this place to a friend. The staff was also very good."}
{"text":"The best way I can describe my experience here tonight is just meh. Everything felt phoned in, the food, the service; mediocre is even giving it too much credit. No wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley. I won't be coming back again anytime soon. This place has went downhill in a serious way since I was last here. Most unfortunate indeed."}
{"text":"I hated Greek food, until I tried this place. 

My \"health nut\" girlfriend had to drag me to this place, kicking and screaming. After all, my long ago experiences with Greek food consisted of soggy grape leaves and poor little baby lambs. 

On my first visit, I ordered cautiously: a grilled chicken pita with French fries lunch platter. The chicken was well seasoned and the pita bread nice and chewy. It was filled with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, red onions and served with a side of delicious tzatziki sauce (refreshing cucumber yogurt). I couldn't believe how much I liked it! A few days later, I dragged my husband in, kicking and screaming like I had done before. Surprise - he loved it too. In addition to the pitas, this time we ventured out (a little bit) and ordered some different items. The Greek fries - wonderful golden crispy fries covered with both feta and Parmesan cheese and a tangy lemon mustard sauce. And the Greek salad, a tasty blend of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, peppers, olives, topped with feta cheese and tossed with a creamy Greek dressing. Since then, we've eaten here many times and continue to explore and expand our menu choices. So far, so good. 

Now it's our go-to place for healthy eating and also if we just want a fun atmosphere. There's music and often Greek dancing in the aisles and sounds of \"OPA!\" coming from the kitchen. Nothing better than to sit back with a pitcher of Sangria, a good meal, and enjoy the fun."}
{"text":"Baklava Cheesecake.

That's all I have to say.

Okay, no there's more.  Graham cracker crust with a thin layer of filo, then thick NY style cheesecake...cinnamon, crushed pistachio nuts, shredded filo on top, sitting on top of a light drizzle of honey with more crushed pistachio decorating the plate.

So good that the meal before it seems like a dim memory...although the gyros are pretty darn tasty too.  Succulent pieces of lamb, thick fluffy pita.  You have to ask for feta on the side otherwise it doesn't come with any.

Also tried the avgolemono soup...creamy chicken rice lemon soup.  Unfortunately, this one was the deal breaker.  The chicken was old and multi-colored and the soup was a little too sour.  I've had it before and really like it normally.  I just don't like it making my mouth turn inside out.

Another sour note was what seemed like the manager yelling in the open kitchen asking his staff if he could meet their girlfriends and how old they were.  Ooooo-kay.  I didn't realize I was in My Big Fat Greek Real World.

The good news was the soup was first, and the cheesecake was last, so I left an extremely happy Margaret.  The waiter was really nice about the soup, and very attentive.  Good enough to make me want to go back sometime."}
{"text":"Went here in one of those moments - \"I am too much of a food snob. Chains can't be that bad.\"

(1) Well, they can. 

(2) I would rather be a snob than walk through their smelly bar for the mediocre entree, salt over dozed appetizer (feta cheese) and tasteless sides (rice). 

It would be far stretched to say I had food poisoning, let's just say my tummy wasn't too happy after. 

 I would attribute the two stars to the great service and the patio/weather. The service was top notch. Friendly but not interfering. The weather was perfect and we sat out on the patio - always a fun experience on Mill. Yes, little to do with the food itself, which is no go for me."}
{"text":"Consistently good Greek food, fairly inexpensive if you go at lunchtime. The gyro is really good, the souvlakis decent. The falafel used to be AMAZING but they changed it and now it's only so-so. Would have gone to four stars if they still had that falafel, that brought me in twice a month, now my patronage is much more spotty."}
{"text":"Had the bruchetta and the Aegean Club. The bruchetta was okay, but the club was AMAZING. Ask the best they had to offer in one lovely and huge sandwich. The fries were the best kind and reminded me of some I haven't had in years and missed greatly.

Had a sip of Zeus beer from tap and it was awesome. Great smell and full taste. Price was nice, too. $4.75 for 16oz and $5.99 for 20oz. 

Overall, very lovely and would seriously do again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately i was not cheering OPA! After my visit here. I heard great things, and i just did not experience these great things.

1) I have had better hummus
2) I hate when the sides that come with the entree are better than the entree itself- this happened here
3) I enjoyed the wine more than the food, and when my tummy is not happy, well.. i am just not a happy girl. We are team my stomach and I and we both agreed that we have experienced better together."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a couple of times.  I really love the food I've had, albeit a bit on the pricey side for what you get, but the service sucks.  Was here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was not even half full yet, it took forever for the server to even make an appearance and even longer to get our food.  

The waitress was clearly forcing her \"friendliness\" and no it's not cool to call someone \"sweetie\" especially when your attitude is funky.  Had to ask the hostess and other staff for things like salad dressing, to go boxes, the bill etc. because our waitress disappeared for long periods of time.

In my opinion this place has no character and the staff have horrible customer service skills and seem to lack ability to appropriately interact with customers.  There are more than a handful of reviews on here that say the exact same thing about the staff's attitudes and the poor service.  I've had enough personally and will take my money and business elsewhere.  I cannot see how a business like this will stay open for long with the high prices and awful service."}
{"text":"Much better than I remember since they reopened. I have been in for lunch a few times recently. The service has been much better and that point is illustrated by the fact that it's not always dead in there anymore (prior to the fire it seemed like it was headed downhill). I've worked at many restaurants in Tempe and it can be hard to get people in for lunch, but they have been busier and I think that's great! 

I tried a summer shrimp salad, the chicken pita and hummus. All were very good. Especially the salad!!!!! YUM :)"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a zero?  Apparently not so I'll stick to the one.  

I went here with a friend of mines and my fiance.  Within' 15 minutes of having their food, my stomach was hurting so bad, I force my fiance to take me home.  Whatever I ate gave me the stomach flu right away.  I've never experience anything like it.  My fiance on the other hand started feeling bad a few hours later.

Let's just say I'll never eat there again even if you paid me.  So not worth it."}
{"text":"We were suppose to go to Paradise Bakery but we passed by this place when a light bulb went off in my coworker's head - \"i want lamb!\"  So, there we were, ordering chicken and lamb souvalaki for our lunch.  While the service was good, the food was subpar.  The meat was overcooked and tasted dry. The pita bread was a tad bit too hard for my liking.  However, the french fries were yummy.  Unfortunately, this isn't McD so I'm not going back just for fries..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read some not-so-good reviews about this restaurant, I did not have the same experience as others.  The service was great - everything came out quickly and we had no complaints about our server.  My husband and I shared a gyro and it was really good, I was happy to see that they had a lamb/beef combo.  We also ordered the Greek fries (fries with feta and tzatziki) and they were excellent!  The portions were also very generous, we were both full from our shared plate.


P.S. The fries earned a star all on their own.  They were that good!"}
{"text":"I've been several times and almost always enjoy the food. Some sides are bland and sometimes the fries are soggy, but food and service are usually what you'd expect. The atmosphere is nice inside and wonderful on the patio, weather permitting.  If your in the mood for Greek, you'll likely enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to put just one star so I relented and gave it 2 stars.  We were in Phoenix getting together with some friends who were there on a business trip..  So somehow we wound up at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant downtown Phoenix.  We live in Tucson and I heard that this chain in just fair.  But majority ruled.  There was a reason I didn't want to go, it was pretty bad.  I had the gyro.  Hard to mess that up, but they sure knew how.  Tasteless and dry.  Hubby had the mousakka  and some very spicy potatoes.  Save your money and skip this one.  I guess a lot of people may not know what good Greek food is like.  Best to try a non chain place.   When we come up to Phoenix we usually go to Phoencia in Tempe.  Now that's good. Sorry guys, I don't like to nix restaurants, but just want to let you know all the facts."}
{"text":"Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations. 

The service was particularly good at this location. We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.

The atmosphere was par for the course.

All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area! (Food-wise)

If you like Mediterranean (American styled, of course), this is THE place to eat in Phoenix. The lamb is great when cooked medium rare, which is VERY VERY hard to find! 

The atmosphere is Greek flaired, but nothing incredible. The service is spectacular. But it is always the food that makes or breaks the place, and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant hits the spot.

If there is any down-side, it is that every time I finish one of their ample sized plates, I have to hit the gym to avoid becoming a big fat something else.

Get the Slouvaki plates!"}
{"text":"This place is a must have! I've been visiting Arizona for over 15 years and I still continue to come here for my favorite dishes. Try the flaming saganaki for a fun show and melt in your mouth cheese with pita. The jalapeño hummus is also great paired with fresh cucumbers. I normally get the steak souvlaki or gyro platter because of its flavorful and mass amount of meat! I always crave the rice pilaf and veggies that accompany it also. During ASU games this is the place to be. TVs, drink specials, busy atmosphere and outdoor seating which overlooks Mill giving it a great place to people watch!"}
{"text":"While out in Arizona for a wedding, my friend and I wandered around downtown Phoenix for something to eat and something to do.  Little did we know that this would be a pretty difficult task.  Who knew that there was so little going on in a downtown area!  Wow - I was blown away at how quiet and boring this place was.  I digress.  After finally having found a small shopping plaza by following a small group of people walking towards something, we decided that this area was going to be our best bet as far as finding something to eat that wasn't fast food.  

Well having walked around the small shopping plaza, we stumbled across this place.  More drawn in by the name than anything else, and having recently seen an episode of Bourdain eating shwarma, Greek sounded pretty good to me.  

As we walked in, the initial person to greet us seemed occupied with something else and decided that he would just go about doing whatever it was he was doing and leave the seating to someone else.   Well, we stood there for a while and after about a minute or two, another employee came and seated us.  Having taken a long time driving around for something to eat, my friend and I took a quick survey of the menu and quickly decided on our appetizer (feta fries) and our entrees (I had the Gyro plate, my girl had the steak kabobs). 

While I was not very impressed with much at this place, I will give this place credit for the feta fries.  They were hands down the best part of the meal and possibly the best feta fries I've ever had.  The cheese was delicious and there was a light rosemary based sauce drizzled on top which was just a perfect compliment to the fries and cheese.  Unfortunately, this is where the good part of the meal ended.  Having waited a good half hour after we had already finished our fries, my gyro plate was nothing to write home about - it was your usual fair with somewhat over cooked rice, sauteed vegetables, and way too little pita and tzatziki sauce for the amount of meat.  My friend's steak kabobs were all but inedible - cold and seasoned with entirely way too much salt, the meat was salty to the point that it was borderline bitter.  Poor girl just ate the rice and veggies and left the kabobs all but untouched.  

Well, overall, this place did not impressed.  Not only was the food not very good, the service was also pretty terrible.  From the half hour wait for food to the server not even taking notice to the untouched steak, I can't say that I liked this place much.  The only reason I would come back would be for the feta fries...mmm...so good."}
{"text":"Friendly place, reasonably priced in attractive location. A natural for hosting friends right? Easy Kemo Sabe! The food can be quite good to downright poor. Like Zorba with arthritis. Can't figure a pattern to it, but its a value/convenience roll of the dice"}
{"text":"Easily accessible for downtown and everything you would expect out of a quality Greek dining experience! Great gyros!"}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant.  We ate here during the Tempe Festival of the Arts.  The food was good and was served quickly. The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that the waitress never came around to check on us. We had to flag her down once to get refills on our drinks. 
The menu seemed to have a lot of options, the prices were decent and the view was nice. I'd go here again."}

{"text":"Nice menu selection; food was tasty.  Good atmosphere.  Wished they had a restaurant in the LA area."}
{"text":"This place has good food if you like their type of food. I do. The Chicken is perfectly seasoned. The hummus is good. The potatoes are probably going to be an acquired taste for many but very nice. So, food a 3.5 stars especially for the price. 

A big plus for this place is their patio. On days like this past weekend, those are the only places I want to go. Sit outside, enjoy the warm weather and the sunshine. Check them out on the weekend in the afternoon after two o'clock for their happy hour and a late lunch / early dinner. Also, at least as of this weekend, the Yelp mobile app is offering a $10 off when you purchase $25 or more and that includes the entire bill."}
{"text":"My Mom says that the food here is very tasty and good and very reasonably priced. Must be, she took us there to eat ate at least four times in the three months that we were in the Scottsdale area, which is very unusual for her, she rarely eats in the same restaurant twice. This place can be extremely noisy, however, especially for us service dogs and our extraordinary hearing."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple times and I have liked it! The hummus is really good! I recommend getting the Jalapeño Cilantro hummus! The service is meh"}
{"text":"Restaurant.com certificate brought me here, and brought me a bill $25 less than it would other wise have been!
That's a \"Yea!\"

The food was all prety good.  We got the Meat Lovers Platter, which for $18 per person (regular price) gave you what the menu described as \"A Symposium of Ecstacy\"

Uh, say what?!?.  Even if we give the benefit of the doubt and use the ancient Greek definition -- a drinking party with intellectual conversation -- it's hardly a fitting use of the word 'symposium'.  

It was more a smorgasbord, or a cornucopia...
heck, let's just call it a Smorgas-copia of Meat.

And to blashpeme the word Ecstacy with such a lame use of the concept!   (although, \"try my meat\" and just maybe...)

There was a huge pile of thick gyro shavings, two lamb chops, one each of beef-chicken-pork kabob skewers, two piles of rice, a bevy of lemony roasted potatoes, a mound of moussaka, a dish of tzaziki, and several stacks of pita wedges.

Volume and quality of the meat was just fine, with the kabobs really outshining everything else, especially the lamb chops, which were actually my least favorite meat item (fatty and almost flavorless, what flavor was there had me wishing they WERE flavorless).

The sides were beyond underwhelming.  The potatoes were over lemon-ed and under anything-else, as far as spice/taste.  The rice was very Minute Rice in consistency, you know, not a grain sticking to another grain; it was annoying, though, with a feel more like orzo than rice.   Tzaziki was really great, but the pita was more like the flat bread they make Gorditas and Chalupas out of than actual pita bread.

Service was friendly when present, but minimally requisite.  I did not feel any inclination to tip over and above the 18% required by the Restaurant.com certificate.

The patio-like area enclosed with glass walls makes for a nice view during the day I'm sure (but of what? the stadium parking lot?) but it also made for a horrendous echo that eventually got quite annoying.

The deal with the certificate was good enough that I'll do it again, but I'm seeing if they offer another location.

PS: it wasn't me that did it, but don't tell a 13 year old girl about lamb"}
{"text":"Considering the fact that I frequent Daphne's in California, I was a bit let down by My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.  The service was alright, and the food was edible...but it was loud because of the bar and smelled funny (I think from burning Ouzo...).  They had the air-conditioning on so high that I found myself shivering in the desert!

Their gyros were decent, but a little on the dry side compared to what I am used to.  The focaccia was exceptional though, and I could have eaten an entire meal of it.  This place is good for the novelty (Greek dancing and a flame-blower), but the food is only OK."}
{"text":"It was ok. Too much of a chain feel to it for it to be considered authentic Greek food. Try Pita Jungle instead."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a quick bite on Mill Avenue. This is also a great place to go with a big group if you aren't sure how much money people want to spend and need an affordable but fun place.  Definitely get the flaming cheese!"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal here. Our waiter was great.He was very attentive and visited us often. I don't understand why others have written about poor service."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has all the ambiance of the Parthenon. There is Greek music in the background. Someone bring out a flaming dish and everybody hollers \"Opah\". The Gyros are some of the best that I have had anywhere. Try the humus. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was not what I thought it would be. The waiter was terrible and barely came to check on us. We waited around 20 minutes to even order our food. The potatoes we were served smelled like vomit and tasted the same. They then lit cheese on fire for the table next to us which blew the smoke on top of us and it was foul. We waited another 30 minutes for our cheesecake to come which the waiter told me they didn't have the right ingredients to that had been promised on the menu. Horrible restaurant would not recommend for anyone that can smell."}
{"text":"My friend Pammie and I get together for lunch about once a month for general chit-chat, catching up and gossip. Everytime we start planning a date, we don't even both with the location - we know: it's always noon at Greek in Chandler.
Love the hummus, love the greek salad with chicken souvlaki, love the big booths and love the atmosphere. It's such a fun place to eat, and while it's not the best Mediterranean in the world, the fun atmosphere and warm pitas keep me coming back every time."}
{"text":"We just popped in here for some lunch.  It wasn't great.  We ordered hummus to start with.  The hummus was okay, but I didn't love the pita.  I prefer the pitas that are used at Pita Jungle

For lunch I ordered a small caesar salad.   First, they brought out a large.  Second, it was AWFUL!  I couldn't even eat a few bites, it was that bad.  I pushed it to the side of the table.  It was really salty and it tasted of anchovies.  I know they are used in the dressing, but you never taste them really.  You could actually taste it.  It was really weird.

The waiter came over and asked if I wanted the food taken away and if I didn't like it.  I thought that was nice because oftentimes waitstaff just ignore it and then clean your plate without mentioning the fact that you barely touched it.  So I liked that he actually asked if I had a problem with it.

The manager came over and asked what was wrong with it.  He was really nice about it and asked if he could bring me something else to eat.  I told him I was okay since I ate the appetizer and shared some of my boyfriend's gyro (which was good!)  He then told me he would comp the salad.  I thought that was really nice of him."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed, as I had been excited to try this place out for a while. We were seated in a corner booth and the walls around us were visibly dirty. The server, though friendly and attentive, was pretty clueless.  I told her that our daughter had a peanut allergy and if I could see the food allergy menu.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  When we asked if there were any items that have peanuts in them or were cooked with peanut sauce or peanut oil, she said the hummus.  While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.  As food allergies are becoming more common and some are potentially life threatening, such as a severe peanut allergy, I think it's important that the staff is more knowledgeable and better prepared to handle questions about their menu."}
{"text":"The place
The place was loud, but what restaurant isn't these days. If the goal is to distract from the mediocre service and food, it didn't work. It really wasn't that bad, however we seemed to have a problem with our chairs sliding around on the tile floor - not a good scene with kids that ant sit still anyway. 

The food
The food was exceedingly average.  When I go to a Mediterranean restaurant I'm looking for bright fresh flavors and at the fat Greek it seems like things are more subdued, almost to the point of being, dare I say, bland?  To top it all off, my wife ordered moussaka and they brought it out cold.  Seriously ... cold!  The waiter took it back and they brought her another plate, but this time it was a totally different dish. Oh goodness.  The third time was the charm - but at no point in this escapade did we hear an apology, no offer to comp the meal or any other action to say \"hey - we messed up\".

Bottom line
There are plenty of other places to find really GOOD Greek/Mediterranean food - skip the fat Greek.
(this review was from a visit a while ago, I hope things have changed)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Had the falafel gyro with greek salad. It was one of the lunch specials so the price was nice. It was just ok, the falafels were over cooked and pretty hard. There was not a lot of tzatziki sauce so it was kinda dry. It came with a side of hummus so that helped some.  There were very few people there, should have been a clue for a restaurant in the middle of ASU territory."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and this is my favorite Greek restaurant that I've found since I moved to Arizona two years ago.  The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the staff is great. We came in last night with a large party and they were very accommodating and happy to have us.  The gyro platter is my go to every time.  But one of these days I'll try to the flaming cheese!"}
{"text":"Always impressed!  The olive plate is a great starter.  Or the feta cheese plate.  My favorite entre is the Tyropita, which is vegetarian.  The vegetables served on the side are flavored with a little lemon, which is so nice.  Mmm!  I also really enjoy their cocktails and beer selection.  The lemon martinis are great!  My mom likes to celebrate her birthday here, and we've been to the Tempe location as well.  The flaming baklava was burned the last time we ordered it, but, other than that, very good experiences here."}
{"text":"I was walking down mill with my girlfriend and was starting to feel hungry. As I passed My Big Fat Greek I was welcomed by a very kind girl (I think her name was Demi...) anyways I sat down looked at the menu and was overly impressed. The pizza is the way to go I should have taken a picture of my dish it was amazing. 

The one thing I found odd about the whole experience was a banner with graduation specials... wasn't ASU graduation on the 10th of May or something like that???

Yet another fantastic restaurant and if you haven't already give this a shot."}
{"text":"Good find.  Food came out fast.  It was basic and good Greek.  Can't beat the prices.  Location in center of town"}
{"text":"I came here randomly and had the beef Angus souvlaki and it was AMAZING. I'm not sure how to describe something so delicious. It was to die for. I wish I could throw it up and eat it again. That's how good it was. Besides the deliciously amazing food, they had fabulous customer service!! The waiters were fun, friendly, and very attentive to our needs. Our waiter was actually a new guy, and this was his first night. He was excellent and his supervisor even came by a few times to make sure we were having a positive experience. I would not only come back everyday and try something new on the menu, but I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. A++++++ FABULOUS food and customer service."}
{"text":"Wow. I have known this place existed for years, but I always figured it was just a chain and probably wouldn't be very impressive. I went here for lunch the other day for the first time, and it was soooooooo good!!! I just got the basic gyro pita, and it was really really tasty. Probably the best gyro I have ever had (and I have had many). Everything tasted fresh, the meat wasn't too greasy, the pita was soft and fluffy and the taziki(sp?) was very good. The fries were also delicious. Nice and crispy. My lunch date got the Greek fries which were other worldly. I will be ordering those next time! Their prices are very reasonable, and our waitress was nice and not annoying! I will be getting lunch here more often now, especially since I work directly across the street!"}
{"text":"mmhmm....strictly average. We ordered bruschettas for appetizers and they were so disappointing. The bread was soggy and the dip was inedible. The whole dish was LIBERALLY laced with some sour condiment, like tamarind juice! We were really hungry so we ate it all up.
 
For the main course I got chicken souvlaki and my friend got the gyro dinner. My souvlaki was good (nothing outstanding). The chicken wasn't dry. It came wrapped with a decent amount of veggies in a falafel. I got a huge side of crispy fries. They were supposed to be seasoned...but I couldn't make out any seasoning. 

My friend's dish was huge. He got deliciously done lamb and beef strips with a side of mildly seasoned rice and steamed veggies. He also got a side of potatoes, which I thought should have been cut smaller and cooked better. My friend discarded them anyway because of the carbs!
One saving grace: our server definitely had some Greek looks :) Just wish he smiled a bit more!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on 1/18/13 with some coworkers.  

I ordered the gyro platter.  The meat was good, though a little of it was a little jerky-ish.  I'm not sure if it was overcooked or was just hard from being re-heated.  It was tasty.  The mixed vegetables were very good. The potatoes were good, though not hot.

The Greek fries.  Oh, the Greek fries.  If you like French fries, and want to try something absolutely freakin' amazing, go to this place and get a platter of the Greek fries. They are soooooo good!  

The service was adequate and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"This is another great iteration of \"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant\".  I've also been to the Old Town Scottsdale and Tempe locations and this location is just as good.  The food is great and the service is fast.  Try the \"Meat Lovers for All\" giant platter of goodness: yum!"}
{"text":"Always happy when a chain restaurant has decent food. First off I thought they might be closed because it was completely dead at the Arizona center. They were open, and yep we were seated right away. They cover the pickiest of eaters who might not want Greek food.  I had the gyro platter and was very impressed. Generous helping of meat, veggies and potatoes. Drinks came in what looked like a half-gallon glass. If the other locations are like this one I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The one in Phoenix was really good and I expected the same here. Not so much, but it was edible. The gyro meat was a bit dry.  The hummus was pretty good and the pita bread is always fresh and warm. Service was really good, even during the lunch rush.  If you happen to be on Mill Ave. and suddenly want Greek food, it will do."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, and overall we were all very pleased.  We ordered the the flaming cheese (not sure on the name) for appetizer.  It was okay.  We then ordered the Meat Platter which had rice, chicken kabob, lamb chops, gyros meat, and other goodies on the platter.  It was enough to food all four of us, fairly priced, and even had some leftover to bring home!  The whole platter was tasty, especially the lamb chops which were my fave part.

In summary, good food, okay service, good prices."}
{"text":"Pita anyone?  

Surprisingly good food really.  I love their super mega sampler appetizer!!!  With a table of 8 we were still nibbling politely as our food arrived.  With a table of 4 it almost could have been dinner.  

And everything is good and you can read other reviews about the valley locations to hear about the huge platters of food, the friendly service, the fun presentation and how cute the place is decorated.  Here's what you need to know - CHEESECAKE.

Oh yes.  I said it.  Cheesecake.  So we got a tip from our server that it's this super secret recipe that their head Chef only makes and then send it over to all locations to sell.  It's been in his family for years and it's won all kinds of awards.  How could we not try it?

Oh my freaking goodness.  It is the bestest cheesecake ever.  SO good.  Skip all the great Greek deserts, and get the cheesecake.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that this location closed yesterday (11/05/2013). Not sure of the reason, it seemed busy when ever I went, which was not often.  It had a good $5.00 lunch."}
{"text":"We went based on the Yelp reviews using the Restaurant.com coupons.  Everything the users have said is true. You are in for a completely average experience. We asked our waiter 4-5 times to bring us Splenda and he never got around to it. The food was stunningly average and the prices just okay. The atmosphere was fine but I wouldn't write home about it. Watch the movie instead if you really are in the mood for some greek culture."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here a couple of days ago.  

First, Alexa, our waitress was a sweetheart, ask for her when you go to My Big Fat Greek Resturant.

Second, the food was delicious, especially the Greek chicken soup. Almost as good as my moms!

Third, we ordered the fries with feta, delicious.  I've had them in Greece & this place did an awesome job on them. The gyro was great & my husband had the platter, which was over board.

So let me finish by saying that we over ordered & didn't get to try our Greek salad, but it looked really good.  Not sure why a couple of people complained, maybe they haven't eaten at other Greek Restaurants.  We'll be back?"}
{"text":"The service was good, but all of the food I had was lacking.  I won't be back.

Appetizer \"Greek\" salad: The lettuce wasn't of good quality, and the toppings were severely lacking.  There was just ONE olive, a few small pieces of cucumber and tomato, and a very small amount of crumbled feta.  The dressing was also creamy concoction instead of oil or balsamic, which was very odd.

Entre: Gyro Platter: This is always something I think is hard to screw up, but alas....
The meat was ok.  The tzatziki was a bit strange...WAY too much dill, and was very thin.  Platter only comes with a couple of small pieces of pita bread, which were soaked in oil from my side of vegetables by the time the plate go to the table, making everything a soggy mess."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I have been coming here for years and the food is the best it's ever been. They recently changed their falafel and it is AMAZING. It used to be a little soft and doughy but now it's nice and crunchy  just how I like it. Harry was our bartender and the mojito he made us was so good I probably could of drank the whole punch bowl to myself  I'll def be back next time I have a falafel craving!"}
{"text":"It's basically the best you can do in the (pathetic) Arizona Center. It's a touch expensive, but then again, you're at the Arizona Center. Flaming cheese is always fun and the servers are nice guys. Wine is overpriced, but you do get a lot of food with the entrees. I like the shrimp appetizer while the gyro is pretty solid too."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Amazon and will never eat anything from here again. My husband's gyro was inedible. The website had salads accompanying the pitas, which is what we ordered/wanted, but instead we were brought cold, super soggy disgusting fries. The pitas themselves were very VERY oily. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"There are many Greek spots in San Diego and they are normally hit and miss.  This spot is on Mill St and it gets alot of traffic due to the college being down the street.  Although a little windy we opted to sit outside cause the weather was nice.  We got a booth for 4.  We let the frequent comer order the famous fire cheese Saganaki!   This was excellent!  Never had it before and will start ordering while in Greek spots.

I ordered the gyro burrito with a side salad.  Gotta say, the salad was ok, but the burrito was great.  i had to force myself to finish it after being full with the first half.

The only reason i didnt go with a four star was because the outside seating had toooo many flies.  they could have put up some repellent of some sort.  but the food was good.  I would come back but sit inside."}
{"text":"Very small bar, but they did offer a Greek beer or two which was nice.

Flaming cheese and assortment of appetizers was fairly good (hummus, baba, etc.) but pricey.  Falafel was among the worst I've had in the valley - larger balls, but very dry and too dense inside.  Not many other options for those of us who normally stick to falafel."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Had a chicken gryo and it was very tasty. The outside seating is wonderful as it overlooks a square with fountains. Many options to choose from!"}
{"text":"First time I have been to this restaurant.  Portions are INCREDIBLY HUGE.  We ordered the Fat Greek Combo appetizer and Meat Lovers platter for 2.  Each of those dishes are really made for 4+ people.  Price is really cheap and the food is definitely authentic. The service here is amazing.  My cup of water never reached below half way and the waiters came to refill it constantly.  Everything was cooked perfectly!  We will DEFINITELY come back to this place again whenever we have a craving for Greek food!  We have enough food to last us for the next 3 days.  Now its time to pass out from the food coma."}
{"text":"I was super turned off by the dishonesty of our waitress. My bill was $18.53 (or .50 something) and I put $40 cash in to get change for a tip. When our waitress brought my change back over 5 minutes later (and me having to ask for it) she only bought back $20. 3 5's and 5 1's. Thinking I couldn't count I gave it to my friend to count who also counted $20. Now $1.50 isn't that much but it was MY $1.50 to decide about. We took the change up to the front and asked where the rest of our change was. The person disappeared with out bill and our waitress came back to...no...not apologize but to claim that there was $21 in there. That she had \"kept $19 for the bill\". I hadn't realized that by paying in cash that meant that the waitress got to automatically keep any change that should have been in there. Granted I would have left the change in there anyway but it was MY money to decide on. She went so far as to ask me if I wanted to count the money again. Of course there would be correct change in there now. She had just gotten the chance to add more. We had already counted it several times before complaining. It was only $20. I still left her $3 which, when combined with the change she already kept, brought her to a $3.50 tip. A fair tip for an $18.50 bill but had she been honest she would have gotten a $5. I was so disgusted by her lying and then trying to cover it up that I will NEVER eat there again. EVER."}
{"text":"Love it!! I have ate there several times now with my family.Affordable prices with generous portions, If I had to pick a couple of my favorites I would say the Athenian spaghetti and Gyro wrap.I have had their other meals and they are really good too. Their cheesecakes and mousse omg sooo good!!"}
{"text":"The Big Fat Greek has zesty and flavorful food at a fairly reasonable price.  I have gone here for dinner and lunch time.  The ambiance to this place would be great for a dinner date.  I have tried only their chicken dishes, but it meets my standards in comparison to Greek food in LA.  I usually order the plate, which comes with a delicious Greek salad and seasoned fresh potatoes.  

The service is very attentive and caring.  I felt like I got water or drinks every 15 minutes refilled."}
{"text":"This place is great - absolutely killer hummus, and they have one of the best gyros in town.  On Thursday, they have fantastic live acoustic music.  Also, the servers here are all great.  Brad the bartender took care of us, and was really attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, I was prepared to hate this place. I was pleasantly surprised - the service was great and the food came out hot. Their tzikzi sauce is phenomenal, and the lamb skewers are really tender and tasty. However the cooked veggie side wasn't all that great (selection of veggies was average at best). Overall, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick $5.95 lunch.  Was not disappointed.  Portions were large, salad was crisp, cold, and just as I like it.  My wife and I certainly will go back especially for the value offered at lunch."}
{"text":"The fact that this place has some lunch specials that are reasonably priced makes it a favorite of my co-workers.  The food is always consistent and service is also good.  I can't complain. ;0)"}
{"text":"Well, if you have been to a MBFGR before then you know the menu. The one in Old Town Scottsdale closed a couple years ago and the one by Chandler Mall is always crazy busy so it had been a while for me. The food was still tasty and a good value at this location. The downside is that a large portion of the restaurant is open to the patio so that makes it pretty hot in the summertime.

An extra star for them since my waitress Anna was super sweet and very professional. I am assuming she's a student but she was very competant and I had a really pleasant lunch thanks to her."}
{"text":"I recently broke my no reviews of chains rule and so now I am writing reviews of the few that I do frequent regularly or that I think are particularly horrible.  I have a friend who is a gyro fanatic and so we go here for dinner pretty often.  I think the food is actually really good.  I am a big fan of their lemony-potatoes, I haven't had those anywhere else.  I usually get the moussaka since that is my favorite Greek dish.  The fact that they have a decent wine list and an upbeat atmosphere makes it a good girls night option... though since it is close to the mall it can sometimes have kids present, which kills the mood."}
{"text":"Two words - Greek fries! Start off with that and end with some baklava to share and your night will be just right.  
Service was a little slow and it was hard to get refills and order tings in a timely manner which is the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. But the servers there are nice and the food is so delicious! I'm a VERY picky eater, I could eat things plain if I had to and the though of lamb makes me cringe but this place really opened me up to some great flavor combinations. 
A must try at least!"}
{"text":"So I came here with my best friend and her daughter.  By the time I arrived (I was running late and they were already seated) she was seriously annoyed with the server and the appetizer they ordered, hummus and pita slices.

After I finally got seated and ordered a drink we ordered our entrees and I got a pita with a side of sweet potato fries.  I liked my sweet potato fries, but the pita was nothing special.  She hated her food, and insisted it was nothing like the other Big Fat Greek Restaurant location she'd eaten at before.  My niece pointed out that the Greek Salad that she had didn't come with traditional, mellow red onions, but bitter yellow onions and she was very displeased.  Also, I tried some of their hummus because they kept insisting it tasted weird...  It had a very strong overtone of pickle juice.  It WAS weird.

Our waitress was okay, except for the fact that she talked like she was trying to squeeze out her sentences in a high pitch voice and as fast as humanly possible.  She asked us if we were interested in ordering dessert, and I swear to glob I had to ask her to repeat herself three different times before I was able to decipher the word \"dessert\" and piece together what I assumed she was asking.  Seriously, it was ridiculous.

Also, the music blasting overhead, while very Greek sounding, was just this side of deafening; it was hard to converse without shouting in there."}
{"text":"So this place used to be a Fridays or some such thing.

First up, the parking lot in this end of the plaza is a zoo. Traffic coming in off of Gilbert road and people trying to get to or from the In and Out and Chick-filet make it wildly dangerous.

If you survive the parking lot then its time to eat.   I've been there twice and they couldn't manage to deliver hot fries either time.  Of course you don't come to a Greek restaurant to eat fries.  The \"Greek\" food part of the menu is serviceable but nothing special.  Ordered a gyro and after 3 tries they got it right (no lettuce, no tomatoes).  Never got the fries hot, but eventually got the gyro right.

Probably a 2.5 in reality but that wasn't a choice."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times, and it's been great every time!  We always order the combo platter and split it (Dinner for 2 for under $20 is extremely affordable in Scottsdale).  The platter has hummus, babaganoush, tsatziki, little Greek meatballs (I think they are called keftedes, but i don't remember), Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice) spanikopita, and pita bread.  We love to just mix all 3 sauces together and put them on the pita bread with the meatballs and chow down.  The spanikopita is also delicious dipped in any of the sauces.  The atmosphere is always warm and exciting, and the staff is always friendly.  This was such a fun place to go on our first Valentines Day together :)"}
{"text":"My sister and her husband insisted that I eat here when I came to visit Arizona! We ordered a little bit of everything (which was mostly delicious), but the flaming saganaki was truly my favorite! 

The staff was friendly, but somewhat MIA. It took forever to track down our waiter to refill our drinks and to get the bill. My sister said the service is normally better so I'll just assume it was because they were extremely busy that night."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there 4 times for lunch. There is almost never anyone in the restaurant at lunch time. Not enough going on at West-Gate to bring people into the area for lunch unless you work close. I always get a Village salad. I don't know anything about their other foods. Why a village salad. I was in Athens for 4 days and every day I got what they called a Greek salad. Their Greek salad did not have lettuce  in it. When you order a greek salad you get lettuce in it. Their Village Salad is what I was getting in Athens. Confused now??? Well that is why I go there. I can get a salad I call a Greek salad just by a different name. If you like Feta cheese, Cucumber, Greek Olives, Tomato, Onion, touch of olive oil and basaltic vinegar. You will like their Village Salad. 

Decoration is appropriate for the food they are serving. Everyone has always been friendly and helpful. The place has always been very clean. 

I don't know anything about the rest of their food. I go there for the Village Salad and I like it."}
{"text":"Man this place was goooood. My husband and I shared the greek fries (he doesn't like feta but scarfed these bad boys down), then shared the Aegan club and Baklava cheesecake. Everything was very good and very filling. I would recommend to anybody that likes Greek food."}
{"text":"I love this chain of restaurants, but this location failed to meet the MBFG standards.

I so wanted to like this place because it is insanely close to my home and is practically adjacent to the Safeway I frequent.

I.  Just.  Didn't.

Here's why:

1.) It was hotter than heck in here.  Today was a hot day.  I understand you want to save money by keeping the a/c off as long as possible, but keeping a restaurant at an estimated 80+ degrees is never acceptable.  

Now, I know I may be more temperature sensitive than other folks, but c'mon folks.

2.) They had happy hour specials on appetizers, but they were only in \"the lounge.\" 

Here's why this doesn't work for me.  There is no real separation between the \"dining room\" and the lounge.  There is no physical barrier whatsoever.  

The sign outside the restaurant does not indicate the specials are only in \"the lounge.\"  Had I known this, I would have asked to be seated in the lounge, which was only really different because there were different chairs there.  It would not have mattered to me.  In fact, I would have preferred it.

3.) After asking what was in the Oscar sauce on the pasta with spinach and artichokes, the server said she did not know.  I indicated I had some  allergies so I needed to know.  She sort of ran off to the kitchen and then came back and told me there was \"no seafood in the sauce\" but wouldn't say what was IN the sauce and then said \"but we don't have that anyway.\"
 
Excuse me?  The menu has a little tag next to it that says \"NEW\" right next to it.  I guess it was not good enough to keep around.

4.)  $40 check versus $25 check at MBFG Express.  

The price difference is not justified when the service at the Warner Rd. location is so much better than the service here.  

5.) They need shades on their patio.  This is really part of #1, but different because it also references the fact it is WAY TOO BRIGHT on their patio.

I won't be in again unless I happen to make it in for their lunch specials.  But maybe I should ask about if those are only good in the lounge, too.

Oh... and I almost forgot.

6.) The cloth napkins had food crusted on them.  Just.  Gross."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location three times, the first time because of a Restaurant.com certificate I had.

All three times the service was SPOT ON.  

My DD loves the Greek music they play in the restaurant.  I loved that they actually encouraged her to dance to it instead of giving us the \"evil eye\" that we've seen in other establishments.

We tend to visit restaurants at family-friendly times, so most of the patrons in the restaurant are either senior citizens or other people with children.  I prefer not to bother other patrons who might be anti-child, especially since my child is particularly friendly and loves to socialize with whomever is seated next to us.

We have tried many of the menu items, but I have to call out the Meat Lovers Platter as being particularly indulgent.  It is $18 per person, minimum two people.  However, the waiter told us that the platter could easily serve four to six people... and he was right.  

We ordered two other entrees and a kid's meal for the five of us and had FIVE FULL boxes of leftovers.

If you're really hungry, there is nothing else you need than the Meat Lovers Platter.  Nothing.

The only reason I don't give MBFG 5 stars is that it just irks me that MBFG Express has many of the same menu items for cheaper.  Since this location actually has some ambience, I can understand paying a little more.  However, I just can't give them 5 stars when the cost of their dinner pitas is $9 when a lot of the same pitas are only $5 at MBFGE.

Overall, this is my favorite MBFG Restaurant location.  I have been to the one in Tempe and the one in Ahwatukee, but this location is top notch for service and ambience."}
{"text":"I dined here at this location for the first time as part of a CMYE.  Since I have been to several other MBFGR restaurants in the valley, I had some expectations coming in.

The hummus and pita appetizer was really good.  I had never ordered this here before, but I would order it again.

I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner, as I do most of the time.  It was a bit dry, but otherwise it was tasty.  

The reason I can't rate this restaurant higher is that on my end of the table not everyone had as good of a meal.  For one, someone ordered a steak and shrimp combo that arrived with the tiniest piece of meat I have ever seen served on a dinner plate.  It was appetizer sized, and overcooked.  The shrimp on the plate came UNDER cooked, as it was served still partially grey.  

When she asked for steak sauce for her overcooked meat, she was asked if she would like A1.  When the bottle arrived, there was only one drop of sauce in the bottle.  When she asked for another bottle, she was told they don't have another bottle and they normally don't have steak sauce.  Hmm.

The other person on my end of the table also had a dry chicken dish.  The kitchen seems to have issues with getting food to the proper temperature.

Honestly, the service was just okay, with me having to hunt down my server for a bag and her not being available for drink refills during most of the meal.  That was surprising considering they knew we were all Yelpers.  

While I would dine at another MBFGR, I would not go out of my way to return to this one."}
{"text":"I'm Greek, and usually very picky about my Greek food.

My Big Fat Greek Restaurant has a modern, fun ambiance paired with classic greek favorites.  When we came they had most of the seating reserved because they had a party of 50 coming in.  Even with the place packed we had speedy service and delicious food.

Try the flaming feta and humus.  For a great american/greek fused side try the greek fries.  To DIE for."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service.  I've been multiple times and often I get my food and then I am ignored until I walk up to the hostess stand ask for my check."}
{"text":"Killer food. Great service. 
Calamari was wonderful.
Souvlaki fantastic 
Greek salad was good."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour in a whim with a group of six. Sat on the patio, which is huge and actually really pretty with all the lights on the palm trees. Three of us ended up with drinks that were not on the happy hour menu- mojitos. Oh gosh they're so worth it and not even expensive though, only $7.50! I've had cocktails for $11 that were just not as good.  We literally ordered everything on the happy hour menu, only $4 a plate. 
The flaming cheese is a must. It's lit on fire table side and pretty fun to look at. But seriously, it's gooey, a little salty and crispy and just amazing spread over a little warm pita bread.
The hummus was good, calamari was great (albeit a little salty but it was perfect with a little alcohol) but the portion was pretty small. Mini pizzas are good, the white and the greco are probably the yummiest two. Good environment, good food, I'd definitely go again. The split check was hilarious to look at for six people though- 67 cents for each happy hour plate per person. So down."}
{"text":"Couldn't eat here today and I'm very dissapointed.   The food smelled great.  Unfortunately my husband saw roaches in the restroom just before I sat down.   Please clean up so we can try again the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"great food, huge portions (though wouldn't mind some more pita!), very friendly waitstaff, and they never disappoint.

the lamb souvlaki is AMAZING, the zucchini cakes, greek fries, gyros, desserts, and pastas are all good... everything we've ordered (and we've been here a lot) has been great

can't think of anything negative really! five stars it is"}
