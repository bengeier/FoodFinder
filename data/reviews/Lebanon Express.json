{"text":"Went there really late around midnight after meeting my friend and i was really hungry as i ate  early in the day. Ordered Chicken Shawarma platter. Price is usually the same for every Shawarma point out there. Taste was good, quantity of chicken pieces was moderate and the spices were a little too strong for me. Service was good and fast. Will give another try and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times.  Garlic sauce is really good as is the hot sauce.  The quality of the chicken isn't that great sometimes.  Once i found a small piece of plastic in my shawarma. Trying to convince my coworkers to try Tummy Time down the street instead."}
{"text":"A lot of shawarma places in this area and this is a good one! I like how they cut they cut the chicken right off the rotisserie into the wrap so it's not dry, and very garlic-y sauce too. Finally, when I went in there was lots of Arabic being spoken with customers - I always take it as a good sign if customers are from where the food is from."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. Amazing value, excellent food, fresh and healthy! Sometimes ordering is a little hectic and confusing but it's well worth it. Portions are HUGE! I think I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"All you need to know is that the chicken was extremely dry. If a shawarma place can't get that right, is it really worth trying?"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best shawarma in town. The wrap and the platter. Great value for what you pay and  tastes a lot better than most places"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, delicious, healthy food. Very friendly people. A few times I've been served complimentary tea or fruit. And they stay open later than anyplace else on Ronces. The only complaint I have is that the falafel wrap is over-filled and always ends up a mess, so don't try to eat it without a plate and fork."}
{"text":"This place is great. They are very friendly. The food is fresh and very tasteful. I love the shawarma here. I have to eat here every time I come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Been going to this place forever because of their generous portions and great staff. Well not anymore. Today i got told that apparently pickled cabbage is not included in your shawarma. It was included for past two years but not today. So i had to pay $4 to get some cabbage. What a cheap cheap customer service. Off to finding another shawarma place. Will never be back again. Way to lose a customer over a bit of cabbage."}
{"text":"Needed a simple dinner we could take back to the hotel.  This satisfied and then some.  The fish was well cooked, as was the falafel.  The have lots of salads, including beets, lentils, tabouli, peppers, all really good.  It's a bit of hole in the wall, but the guys are nice, they have good food, and the prices are really reasonable.  You can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"THE BEST. My Fav out of all (of the very many) shwarma places in the area. And in general. This praise comes for many reasons, including the following:  - Serving size: monster shwarms - Quality: literally one of the best tasting shwarmas Ive ever had - Service: Anone and Harry are 50% of the reason I go back. I swear. These guys are beauties. Anone sorry I spelled your name wrong big man. Correct me when Im in next.   - Hours: Ive gone at dinner time, and its good, but some how always tastes better on my way home from work at 230am on a Saturday night.  - Vibes: generally good vibes. good area. good people. good food. GO HERE.   ** only drawback, pickles are cut as cross sections not as longitdinal slices to match the turnips. Frustrates me. BUT I LOVE IT ALL THE SAME. Give the place character.   COME HERE YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED"}
{"text":"Best shawarma plate ever!!! The chicken is always moist and tender and the sauces are great! I always come here when I'm in need of middle-eastern comfort food!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place about 5 times now and I haven't been disappointed once.  Going into it you know this is a fast food Lebanese joint, not a fancy restaurant. A place for a good quick eat.  I normally would order the chicken shawarma sandwich but the last couple times I ordered the plate. It comes with rice, potatoes, picked beets, salad (with beans, lentils, lettuce, capsicum, onion and much spice) hummus, garlic sauce, pickles, pickled cabbage, pickled turnip all topped with chicken and hot sauce. For 10$ it is a large portion of food. I can only finish it on a very hungry stomach.  Today when I visited it was better than ever. Flavor explosion! Bring water as I am sure you will be thirsty afterwards.   The only gripe I have is the cleanliness. The place is a bit grimy but that comes with the territory unfortunately.  Service - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Atmosphere 3/5 Value - 4/5  Overall - 4/5"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Would come by every once in a while after class but not sure if they changed owners or so. Prices are way higher than what I remembered. $14 for a chicken shawarma plate. Flavours are also off. They used to have the best hot sauce but it's just not the same. The chicken was a bit dry, the salads were okay, there is still quite a bit of variety in the box including a pita on the side. But I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"It's slightly embarrassing to count how many times I've eaten here. You get a massive amount of food, def your money's worth (and more). Chicken shawarma plate is my jam. They have some of the best garlic sauce and hummus around.  It's more of a takeout place but they do have a few seats to eat in if you want."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawrma plate. Great selection of salads and very fresh. They also give a very large portion for just under $10. I thought the hot sauce tasted a bit different to what I'm used to, but not in a bad way."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic takeout experience.  I had a mix of a lot of things and I like this style of food because it is protein rich, easy on the carbs, and nutritious.  The flavors were amazing! I was really garlicky afterwards and had a meeting the next morning, but I would do it again, and again. The staff was super kind.  If your flight arrives after usual dinner time, this late night option will not disappoint."}
{"text":"After a couple more visits I'm finally going to pass judgement on this shawarma place. My first visit was at peak lunch hours & it was busy so I was a little more forgiving. My next 2 visits were not during peak operating times. The food was fine nothing really to say. You can get the same quality at any other shawarma vendor in the city.   How they treat each customer is an issue for me. When one group of people receives preferential service over another it's discrimination in my eyes. I don't want to use the \"R\" word but if it walks & talks like a duck then this place is definitely quacking. So if you are Caucasian, Middle Eastern or Black, count yourselves the lucky ones.  And just today I helped the owner lift the cash register table up so an elderly employee could put a wedge underneath. Did I get a thank you or any acknowledgement? Well I'm not one of the \"lucky ones\" so what do you think!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shwarma plate for delivery. The chicken was very dry and bland and cut into way bigger chunks than you'd expect for a shwarma. My side was a kale-apple salad which was way to vinegary. They also forgot the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Walking through Parkdale, we worked up an appetite.  We figured we'd check out the Roncy stretch and see what might catch our attention.  We saw a guy eating a massive plate that looked amazing so we decided to give this place a try.    We ordered two plates (one shawarma and one kofta), so we were able to taste different meats and sides.  I enjoyed all of them!  I did find the shawarma meat a tad dry but with the sauces it was fine.  The kofta was flavourful and straight off the bbq.  Beet salad, yum.  Roasted cauliflower, potatoes, and eggplant, yum.  Tomato and cucumber salad with parsley was okay.  FYI: I never order salad but today I did because their kale salad really caught my eye.  It looked so fresh and colourful!  There was an abundance of ingredients and it was so well dressed.  I loved it!  Apples, cranberries, etc.    Solid portions and overall delicious!  I'd definitely come back.  :)"}
{"text":"You have to try the baklava. And the French fries are delicious with the garlic dipping sauce and hummus. The salad bar is varied and fresh. This place really is quite stand out in its quality. Recently under new management?"}
{"text":"Been here many times mostly for the beef and chicken shawarma plate. Good flavour, lot of choices for salads (unlike Ali Baba), large portions and friendly service. They'll also give you a toasted pita (if you ask). I would give them a 5 star if that time I had a samosa it wasn't cold and wet (near closing time though). So just have the shawarma and you're good."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers and had the chicken shawrma combo/plate that came with rice, potatoes and a mixture of salads.  It costed just over $10 including tax.    What I liked: -They have more salads than your typical Middle Eastern place and it's fresh.  They have 5-6 different types of salads. -Your combo comes with potatoes, salad and rice -The beef shawrma was quite tasty.    What I disliked: -Pricing is very confusing. They have like 3-4 combo's of what seemed to be the same thing.   -It's slightly dirty or at least very messy.   -Seems pricier than your normal Middle Eastern joint  Verdict: It's decent food and fresh, but I think it's kind of pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to come across a Lebanon spot so close, but with such poor service and food. I ordered a chicken shwarma and a falafel. The employee serving me couldn't have cared less as he prepared my food - luckily I like everything because he didn't ask me what I wanted on it.   The food was dry, not flavourful, expensive for what I got.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Salads are delicious here ! I ordered a chicken shawarma salad and now I'm totally hooked on this place. Huge portions and you can pick four different salads for your order. I had a kale salad with apples and cranberries, a mixed peppers/cucumber salad, a chickpea salad and a beet salad. All were delicious and it comes with lots of pickles, hummus, sauces and plenty of chicken. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Healthy, Good Prices... definitely would recommend. Chicken shawarma is great. They serve huge plates"}
{"text":"No better value for Lebanese food on the yonge street strip. Ordering can be a struggle sometimes, but you're basically able to fully customise any dish (without extra cost, which is unusual). The quality of the salads (they have about five to choose from) is the highlight. And the baklava makes up for any thing that went wrong in the ordering process! It's incredible. Take out at this place, as only a few eat in seats."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Canada, by far. Really fresh, tasty ingredients. These folks really know how to craft amazing Lebanese food. Very friendly too. They also have delicious fresh made juices. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food, poor service and unfriendly staff. They will fill up you sandwich with cheap vegetables and very little meat.   The meat is dry and portions of meat inadequate.   Not sure about the other reviews but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times since being in the area. Fast. Friendly. Once it was almost midnight and the boys were amazing. Fresh for sure.  The other time was on the patio.  Fresh.  Good value for your money.  Clean service."}
{"text":"There is way too many better shawarma places in downtown. Even cheaper too. Falafel n Halal bros just a few examples. The meat is bland n average. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"First thing you'll notice, the smell! like holy sh!t, The strongest and best smelling shawarma place when you walk pass!. The plate and wrap portions are good as well as good tasting, although i feel like their falafel wrap isn't as tasty as their shawarmas. One thing i notice is that one of their vegetable i believe is more sour than other places, so you have been warned. Taste-wise compare to other places around, it tastes similar but different than Pita Way, which is around the block."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good prices. This is actually a great place to get quick lunch or dinner. Chicken shawarma plate is the best I had in a while. I like that chicken is all white meat, no fat pieces as in other places. Their hummus and falafel is very good, as well. And they have so many salad choices. Located close to subway on Yonge."}
{"text":"Me and my bf have found it hard to find god shwarma downtown. He has always wanted to try this place and went for lunch one day. He convinced me that it was really good and that it was! Finally a place that has a legit shwarma. Very juicy and delish chicken, and fresh veggies inside. The sauces are full of flavour and the staff is super nice. Since Pita Nutso is my number 1, this i will give my number 2. For sure will be visiting this place again and again for that good house made shwarma."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The service was a little scattered late in the lunch rush and the employees could all stand to speak up a bit, but the food is excellent and quick and reasonably healthy and fairly priced. We loved the moussaka and the wrap was definitely enough for two servings!"}
{"text":"We make it a point to eat at this hole in the wall every time we come to Toronto.   both the beef and chicken shawarma are great, and the sides are amazing, from the hummus and garlic sauce to the tabbouleh, salads and rice. Have yet to try the falafel."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!  This is the best middle eastern place in downtown Toronto! The chicken shwarma plate and piping hot falafels are my staples but they do everything well here. The chicken is fresh and good quality meat. The portions are generous and so reasonably priced! Icing on the top is that the servers are really friendly!"}
{"text":"Whoa, talk about not judging a book by it's cover....  When you look at it from the outside, Lebanon Express looks like a fairly generic shwarma place. I was done with a walking tour just before lunch, and was super famished when I chanced upon this place that looked like it could provide me with sustenance on a budget. So in I went, and got a very pleasant surprise.  It got the chicken roll and boy was it full of flavor. You get chicken, hummus, garlic sauce, the standard shwarma veggies, rolled into a pita that is toasted. Everything was fresh and delicious. I lived in Copenhagen before this where they swear by their kebabs, but this place throws Copenhagen a pretty mean gauntlet. And bonus, there is Arabic and Bollywood music playing on a loop on youtube on their TV. :)  Cheap and good. Do go."}
{"text":"I don't know why people give this place hard reviews.   They do very impressive fresh looking salads (even for late January, when it's the middle of winter and veges tend to be blander/less colourful).  I went the other day and found bright colourful salads; many kinds.  It puts most shwarma places in Toronto to shame.  The chicken they also serve actually looks and has the texture of real chicken, unlike many of other greasy shwarma places.  If people of Toronto think this place offers crappy food for downtown, they are kidding themselves.   It's also very reasonably priced for downtown standards.  highly recommended for a simple bite to eat, particularly if you're craving a salad with all kinds of veges, lentils, chickpeas etc."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto for only a few days and this place happened to be right by my hotel.. And I'm glad that it was!   Excellent, polite service, large portions for a reasonable price.. And the food was great! Spicy, flavourful, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff.  Walking down Younge and wanted a quick bite, shawarma was solid, and baklava was extra-good.  Bang for the buck as far as price.  I'll happily go there again."}
{"text":"A rather objectionable smell hit me when I entered this place but I was so hungry I decided to still give it a try - my roommate recommended it after all and I haven't had shawarma in years.  Well... plenty of the chicken pieces were so dry, they already felt crusty. I only managed to taste the hot sauce in the very beginning, so either they only put it there or it was so mild that I couldn't notice it any more after two bites (and I don't even eat a lot of hot food). What they definitely just put on the other end though it seems was some sauce with herbs and spices. All stuck in the very last piece of the shawarma - which made that bit pretty unpleasant in terms of taste and I would've loved to know how it would've tasted had it been spread evenly across the whole thing. Also, overall, the place looks rather cheap to me and I found it slightly annoying that there seems to be only one source of napkins. Maybe i'm just spoiled but i think either giving a napkin to each customer or at least one such thing with napkins per table should be doable.  Service was rather friendly and fast though."}
{"text":"Getting late in the evening and needed something quick.  Went walking and found this place in 5 minutes. Large group taking up most of the seating was loud and having fun which I take as a good sign.  No wait when I walked in. Greeted quickly but not friendly, the employee took my order and got to it.  Asked my preferences with each step and gave a generous portion.  Chicken Shwarma Salad Plate with a helping of all the options minus beets.  Garlic sauce was good not great but complimented the meat well.  Its easy location to home and a positive first impression will likely make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"Seriously. This place sucks!   I never went there before the \"management change\", but currently there are two dudes, one can't hear or understand what you've ordered and the other has a badly infected eye that's been running (yes... like flowing with tears) for the past couple weeks. You order one thing and he tells the cook something totally different. It'd be kind of comical if it weren't your food they were preparing...  Their salads are literally soaking in vinegar. Whom.EVER.THE.FRIKK told them to do this? I suspect it's to \"preserve\" the stale salads ... it makes the experience extremely intolerable and noxious. I got a Fattoush+chicken salad and the dude put some pungent sauce on it WITHOUT asking. plus the salad had already been given a bath in ... I dunno, Lemon, Lime, Lye, Chlorine?? who the F. knows! It was in-edible !!  I don't think I'll ever go there again.   P.S. A big F.U. to the Toronto Food Inspectors who let establishments like this do business without enforcing even the bare minimum of controls. Is Yonge street up to bloor just a forgotten wasteland as far as restaurants are concerned because only the tourists are stupid enough to eat at these establishments? Huh?  ZERO STARS for TO Food Inspection Unit!"}
{"text":"This place was my favourite shawarma place in all of the GTA, UNTIL the new owner took over. It is now disgustingly bland, and tasteless... they have completely changed the recipe. I'm really disappointed to see such a great place go downhill. I should have known not to buy as soon as I did not smell the authentic smell that made this place unique, and the absence of music outside of the restaurant.   I'll be on the lookout for a replacement. Bye Bye Lebanon Express."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Ubereat.. worst taboule ever had , super sour . Paid 16 for the dinner plate, such small food portion,, and I am not even a big eater , still not full after finished eating . Disappointing !"}
{"text":"After trying some not so good mediterranean food, I am glad I stopped by this place (located close to Yonge and College subway station). The food looks and tastes really good, very flavourful and fresh. People working there were very friendly and nice. Helped with the menu and even gave us some samples before buying. Falafels were made fresh right in front of me (we took extra falafels that was $1.99 for 3 falafels - very soft and good). The salad bar was tasty too, loved the beets, tabouli salad with lentils or chickpeas. Very delicious potatoes and chicken shawarma! I was very impressed by this small place (they have few tables where to sit and eat. Or you can have a take-out.) Have to admit that chicken shawarma was one of the best I have tasted in the last year or so. The pieces were white meat without any ugly or fat pieces as I have been served in other places. I highly recomment. The prices are okay, as the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"This place really gives you your moneys worth. I ordered a fish plate, which comes with a fish fillet, your choice of three salads, rice, a potato piece, and your choice of sauce PLUS a pita. I wasn't too keen on the pita. And their fish was a little on the oily side but besides that well worth the money.  Not to mention they greet you with a smile, not robottically like their neighbours. (chmmm California sandwiches)  I would definitely return and try other menu items."}
{"text":"First off have to say they have some amazing french fries. Just love them. Crispy on the outside, potato goodness on the inside.   The rest of the place is about average.   Fin."}
{"text":"Best falafel I have ever eaten, so fresh and tasty, we ate there two days in a row.  Perfect quick place to grab a quick lunch.  The variety of salads are also excellent, fresh, and tasty.  Will go again.  Very affordable and healthy."}
{"text":"OK if you are hungry at 1 am. Decent and so much fresher and nicer staff than the Pita Way around the North corner (which is often empty... for a reason!)."}
{"text":"Some of the best falafel I had in a while. In town for a quick lunch off peak hours. Abundant portions,very good salad.I wasn't fond of the fries but everything else was great. The staff was very friendly. I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"We were walking around and found this place and it was shocking what was inside. Fresh, Fresh food that was so unbelievable I still cant believe we found it.  I asked her to make a  plate with a little bit of everything and I think its the best food I have had in years."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad. I've tried the chicken and beef shawarma so far as well as the falafels. They have different daily specials and the prices are relatively low compared to other similar joints. The beef and chicken can be dry at times depending on when you go and who's working there, but the falafels are usually a good bet"}
{"text":"YUMMMM. Ordered Lebanon Express today from Uber Eats and it was so good. Also, so much food. I ordered the falafel plate and it comes with all this: four big falafel balls (not the freshest, but still good), saffron rice, two sides (I picked the beet salad with sumac and the kale and apple salad but there were like six to choose from), basically as many sauces as you want (I got hummus, tahini, and garlic sauce), and pita bread on the side. I was starving when it arrived and finished maybe half. Was enough left over for a little afternoon snack and as a side with my dinner - great deal for the price. Would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"our middle eastern neighbourhood fast food joint, much better than the greasy Ghazales around town! great location with fresh food and plenty of seating specially with the patio when it's warm enough outside. we eat there every now and then! prices have gone up but it's still worth ut for the big healthy portions."}
{"text":"Sadly, this weekly favorite recently changed hands and the quality of the food declined. First to go were the delicious eggplant sandwiches. Tried the new veggie sandwich which sadly only contained only potatoes. Then the quality of the remaining ingredients began to decline (tabouleh with vinegar?). The result, I have been searching for another place to satisfy the hunger for a decent falafel or eggplant sandwich."}
{"text":"Raised their prices starting November 2016 buy their shawarma wraps are filling, healthy and flavourful. $10 per wrap and try heir been samosas; spicy and will clear you out. I remember working downtown and if I was hungover or felt like shit, this place would set me straight. bathroom is small but they have a Dyson."}
{"text":"great place for a quick bit, however a couple of things  they were out of shrimp when i went, only one server was working, on a Sunday, which lead to a line up and people walking out. the a.c was broken so the restaurant was very very warm. negatives aside, this was an amazing place to try, loved the serving, and the food.  the tzatziki is STELLER, my mouth was burning from all the garlic, which was amazing.  not the best i've ever had, but better then normal :)  will definitely come back"}
