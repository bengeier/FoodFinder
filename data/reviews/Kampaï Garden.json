{"text":"It was ok.  Atmosphere gave it a 3. Food was super tiny, not cheap, and under average in taste. Drinks were ok, they went crazy with the ice. Pool tables were a plus."}
{"text":"This place is so underwhelming and overrated. The food options are limited so don't come here if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Quelle déception!  L'architecture intérieure est intéressante, mais pour moi dès qu'un endroit est aussi grand, il perd son âme...  C'est une véritable usine!!!! Les plats sont très très décevants... Ils manquent d'assaisonnement et ne sont pas du tout généreux! Fade fade fade! Et rien d'original! Le meilleur plat qu'on a gouté est l'assiette des frites! Les boissons sont bonnes mais leur sélection de bière n'est pas varié. Enfin, l'endroit est TRÈS snob et s'oppose à l'esprit de tout beer garden... Je n'y reviendrai certainement pas!"}
{"text":"Stick to the bar have liquor and beers avoid the food /da cocktails and u will have a good time (it get really busy"}
{"text":"Went in for a drink on a Saturday night.  Place was a third empty, but Asian Maitre'D told me you need a reservation.  For the bar, place is empty?  Pretty idiotic, good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"I am giving these guys a 3 based on my mixed experience over 2 separate visits.  The first, which is getting a 1, was when they first opened.  They either weren't answering or did not yet have set up a phone number for Kampai as it was so new, so I called Apt 200, one of their sister restaurants, to have someone there set me a reservation for the following week...a Thursday night at 9:30 for 20 people from my work.  We were having a holiday party that night at the office and wanted an official afterparty pre-planned.  Jasper, who took my number and information from Apt 200, assured me that with 500 seats at Kampai, they would be able to accommodate my group no problem.  When we arrived a little after 9:30 (about 5 minutes late) we were told our reservation was never made and that someone had communicated that to me over the phone (not true).  Furthermore, the bouncers thought they worked at a Michelin rated restaurant in New York City because they took their jobs way too seriously.  The crowd is very grown up/dressed up and no one was making a scene save for the doorman who want you to wait out in the cold if you don't have a reservation even though the place was not full.  They were also rude/put their hands on people if they simply leaned against the pool tables (no one was sitting on them...again, this is not a college or high school crowd).  Very rude!  The only saving grace is that I went solo with my boyfriend this weekend and we didn't have reservations but they led us to one of the standing tables next to the open kitchen and once a couple left their seats, we were able to grab them.  They were super busy and the food came about 45 minutes after we ordered, but the manager was generous and kind and gave us a round of drinks on the house and a heartfelt apology for the wait.  It was worth it though because the FOOD IS AMAZING once you can get it.  My boyfriend who has been a chef at some of the highest ranked restaurants in NYC really did like the food and that's saying something because he usually hates to eat out.  Net net.  I love the food and friendliness/service of the main staff (hostess, coat check, waitress, manager), but the bouncers and the wait for the food leave more to be desired.  Will go back and hope to update the review with more positive news next time around."}
{"text":"Kampai is beautiful as all the other reviewers have remarked. The interior is huge. It takes up the entire lower level of the part of the Fabourg it occupies and it's become the go to spot for basic Montreal biddies to get dolled up and take photos.   As a result, this place has become CROWDED. Unbearably so. Even though there's a line around the block most Friday and Saturday nights, there are always way too many people inside making the Kampai experience less than ideal in terms of service speed and comfort inside.   Kampai has a decent variety of interesting drinks named after some relevant pop culture figures. We had the Pikachu and were tempted by the cocktail named Starboy. The drinks were delicious but light on alcohol. At 60oz for $30 it wasn't overly pricey and reasonable to split between friends. Pitchers of beer will come in similarly at $25/60oz.   The food is okay. I wouldn't come here for a meal necessarily because it tends to be quite loud and appears to be much more of a drinks place.   The lower level has some games such as basketball and foosball.  Overall a good concept but maybe wait a few months for the crowds to die down before making the trek to Kampai."}
{"text":"The experience was very poor , although the food was ok . My entire party felt very pressured to eat and drink fast so we can be out by the time the next group comes ... it wasn't very pleasant . 2 of my friends came. A little late due to parking and the manager refused to let them in and was Very rude to me ! Management #101 : it's always about the customer and he failed to realize this . I won't really recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"J'y vais premièrement avec un conseil. Arrivez tôt la fin de semaine (17-18h). Lorsque vous serez bien installé, vous remarquerez la superbe ambiance et la musique qui fait bouger sur notre chaise. Commandez un cocktail. Je vous suggère le pikachu ou le lucky peach. Côté bouffe, les portions ne sont pas énormes. Prenez au moins deux ou trois plats. Le tofu croustillant avec la sauce aux arachides, les dumplings au porc et le tartare de boeuf sont d'excellents choix.  Si vous voulez être tendance, prenez le poke bowl. Il est excellent!"}
{"text":"Nous arrivons à 18h30, le resto est peut être au 1/3 plein mais pas de table. Nous nous asseyons au bar, pas grave. Par contre, on s'est fait entasser avec d'autres couples au bar, alors que le resto était toujours au tiers plein plus la soirée avançait... peut-être offrir une table et spécifier l'heure de la réservation aux clients ? Parce qu'être assis dans l'entrée ne permet pas de profiter de l'ambiance du resto...   La carte d'alcool était intéressante, variée. Par contre, si vous demandez un cocktail plus classique, il y a des risque qu'il ne soit pas bien dosé, comme le fut mon gin tonic. Les tapas étaient délicieux ! J'ai pris les nouilles udon et le saumon sashimi. C'était super bon.  Service ok, un peu difficile d'attirer l'attention de la serveuse qui était aussi barmaid pour tout le restaurant.   En somme, ce doit être bien si tu veux y aller en groupe et que tu as réservé d'avance !"}
{"text":"C'etait sympa mais sans plus, un peu surfait et overrated comme bar/restau, alors oui c'est super trendy mais attention les prix. Pour de menus tapas what you see is what you get pour un prix que je trouve démesuré."}
{"text":"I've visited Kampai Garden with my girlfriends on a Thursday evening, we had chosen this place for drinks, it was my first time there as I wanted to wait for the frenzy to go down before visiting.   We arrived around 5:30, the restaurant was not busy but started filling up very quickly around 6:30. We ordered a variety of cocktails that are only served in pitchers: Jungle Juice Margarita, Kampai Mojito, and Passion Fruit Splash as well as appetizers: Fried Chicken, Hush Puppies, and Pork Dumplings.  Unfortunately, we were not impressed by the drinks, one of them in particular, which left us all an unpleasant aftertaste, the appetizers were ok but nothing out of the ordinary.   The place is well decorated if you're into the neon-catchy-phrase type of ambiance. The service was great and very quick, however, I was not thrilled by the food and drinks experience... Overall experience: 3.5."}
{"text":"I had pretty mixed feelings after leaving this restaurant. The decor is beautiful, definitely a prime Instagram location (for all us millennials...) but the menu options are quite limited. I was under the impression that it was a beer garden but the beer selection was super small. We opted for the 'Jungle Juice' Margarita which was pretty tasty. It had flower petals inside which was interesting (and pretty)!   Our waitress was informative and attentive. She explained the tapas situation and we chose to sample two items: the shrimp tacos and BBQ ribs. The ribs were spicy but overall quite good and we LOVED the shrimp tacos! That said, the portions were very small for the price tag.   Also, there was a small misunderstanding with the bill and our waitress immediately offered to correct it--no hassle--which was great. Weirdly, they don't offer drinks by the glass (other than select sangria options).   We left feeling pleased overall but probably wouldn't jump at the opportunity to go back. I would say it's worth a try!  EDIT: They do serve regular cocktails by the glass but not signature cocktails. Our server just didn't communicate that clearly."}
{"text":"Good food. Good cocktails but not very boozy, gorgeous place.   We had a reservation for 18 people, celebrating my friend's birthday. We started with cocktail pitchers and really liked the lucky peach which does that taste like peach and is closer to a monitor with that minty fragrance. However after drinking 1 medium pitcher, I was getting no buzz at all; these drinks should be stronger if they are gonna cost that much.   We order 5 tapas style plates between my husband and I ; carpaccio beef (OK but too much Dijon), carpaccio tuna (delicious), poke bowl (wouldn't recommend it. Good but had 2 tiny pieces of fish for 18$), fried oyster (it is 1 giant oyster so hard to share. Was very good, but only if you like that fishy taste) and the best dish was the crispy tofu. I think I would go back just for that!  The place is really beautiful and I had to remind myself that I was at the faubourg.   When we left around 9:30pm (Saturday), there was a crazy line-up of millennial hoping to get in. I think that's a bit much.   Nice place, nice food, but expensive and small portions. I wouldn't line up for it."}
{"text":"Mon amie et moi on aime les lieux dits 'fusion', où tu sais pas trop bien quoi répondre quand on te demande 'c'est quoi le style de bouffe?'. Ben le Kampaï c'est un peu ça. Des tendances asiatiques, avec des mixes d'ailleurs. Par exemple on a pris des 'tacos' qui étaient plutôt une galette a base de riz et épicé au curry, donc indien peut-être, avec une garniture de crevettes, clairement pas indienne, mais pas mexicaine non plus... mais tellement bon! Mon plat préféré lors de cette visite. Ils proposent des plats de type tapas à partager alors on a fait un petit assortiment et au final c'était un peu trop de bouffe mais on a quand meme fini. Le décor est intéressant, moderne, fusion, donc difficile à décrire, un peu comme la bouffe finalement. Je serai pas rentrée spontanément si ma copine ne connaissait pas deja le lieu et je suis bien contente de cette découverte. A priori les fins de semaine c'est vraiment plein et il faut réserver. Un Lundi soir c'était ok de juste y aller. La carte des cocktails était intéressante, proposés sous la forme de pichet, ca permet de partager et c'est moins dispendieux. La carte des vins est assez longue mais peu de choix au verre et que des verres a plus de 10$ donc t'abuse pas trop! Le serveur était sympa et de bons conseils, l'ambiance détendue et propice a la discussion. A retenter en fin de semaine pour voir la salle bondée et tester les cocktails!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food but this place is ALIVE on a Saturday night! Wishing we had a place like this in Vancouver. Loved the decor, music and people! The tables were all sold out but Willson did his best and my girls and I had table service right on the bar! What?! I know right!! Our last night in Montreal was done right!"}
{"text":"Le service etait un peu long, mais je dois dire que la place est très belle ! Je ne pense pas y retourner etant donné que les cocktails ne m'ont pas vraiment impressionné, mais je ne peu pas juger la bouffe car je ne l'ai pas essayé !"}
{"text":"Second park place I've been to and although the drinks were wonderful and a nice place to go to, the food was much like park were it left you wanting something more. The dishes in no way we're bad, they just didn't impress. It's clear that there requires a greater emphasis on flavour.   There was no standouts dishes which is always disappointing.   Go for drinks, order something to munch on but look elsewhere for a meal."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to Kampai Garden. The first two visits didn't catch my breath- although the decor, music and the ambiance were great - the food was average. Most dishes are meant to be shared, with prices averaging around 12$ to 20$. The dishes I tried included (rating on 5 *) the shrimp tacos (2 pieces)****, chicken wings *, calamari *, beef tataki ***. As a main dish the poke bowl *** was pretty filling. However the flavours had no kick.  This time around - We got there at around 5:40 pm hoping to get seats at the terasse- just to see what the hype is about that Mtl bloggers are claiming. We were a group of 7 and told that the terasse is available on a first come first serve basis. once we arrived -we were told that it was only for a max of 6 ppl. It makes no sense to have a no reservation - first come first serve policy and then put a cap on the number of seats!   The menu had significantly changed introducing a selection of new cocktails and dishes (ex duck bowl). For drinks- I didn't like that the starting price for cocktails was 20$ for a 32 Oz pitcher leaving you no smaller size options to try for a cheaper price. (Not to great for your liver!) The cocktails reminded me of the terasse bonsecours sangria - not crazy about them. So I stuck to a usual glass of red for 10$ which was a safe choice.   For my main course - I chose to Kampai Garden salad for 24$ - Magnificent! I was blown away by the portion- this was easily a salad for 2! With over 3 types of sauces( green, Thai and soya sauce) a boiled egg, soya beans, sweet potato noodles ****, green salad, seasoned tofu, Kim chi pickled veggies  and much more. I did manage to finish it because I was so hungry!    I'm slightly impressed this visit - initially this venue didn't own up to park's title but I'll be open to see what summer menu awaits"}
{"text":"Kampai...it should be more like KamFRY Everything on the menu is fried and overpriced  The beef tacos are good as well as the Michigan hot dogs...but overpriced  The fried Oyster is the saltiest thing I've ever eaten, The Poke bowl was extremely small and tasteless.  The decor is nice and the place is always jammed. But would not go back as it is over priced and not worth it even though Antonio Park is involved......"}
{"text":"Such an amazing time out there!  We met the manager Wilson Luu who made us feel like home! Everyone from the bartenders to waitresses were super friendly too! Also food was really good. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very lit and great food. Frankie is the dopest bartender and host! Ask for the Frankie Special I didn't even know it was a real thing I just made it up while drunk and Frankie pulled through with the best tasting drink!   Would defs recommend and go again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Kampai Garden! The ambience was pretty good, the food and drinks were excellent, but the service was a little slow.   Their concept in Kampai is to share the menu, both drinks and food, which I thought was super cute. We got the black bean udon dish and a cocktail that I forgot the name, but it was the only one with vodka in it. Oops. Their place is very much a Japanese fusion, so I didn't expect the dish to be authentically Japanese (especially since there's no such thing as black bean udon in Japan lol), but I really enjoyed it! My friend and I savoured it and also enjoyed the drink, which was a really refreshing sour one.  The decoration of Kampai is so cute, I adore it. It has a very classy black and white theme from its floor to the tiled tables, and some neon touches on the walls. Some seats have a sofa-like feel to it, with the cushions and everything. I noticed that their utensil holders were also wasabi pea cans, which I found to be a cute contrasting touch to the modern vibe they were going for.  One last thing, I'm just going to say that I love their bathrooms. It's on the mezzanine floor and you would see \"BOYS\" and \"GIRLS\" in front of you, but what I didn't notice at first was their gender-neutral bathroom, \"WHOEVER\" on the right. I flipped out and got really happy.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience overall and I appreciate that this place is right near Concordia, where I study! I'm looking forward to take my other friends there as well."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It's called a beer garden and yet the beer selection is laughable. I opted for a small pitcher of mojito, came down to just under $30 after tax/tips. Besides that, I get that everything is very Instagramable but the decor doesn't feel authentic. You want authenticity and aesthetics why not go to Riverside in Saint-Henri, or Sainte-Élizabeth in quartier latin?  Overrated much."}
{"text":"J'ai été là pour prendre un verre après un superbe évènement Yelp. Étant parti en voyage....j'en avais entendu parler vaguement...mais sans plus...En étant dedans je me suis souvenue que c'était THE SPOT ben à la mode donc plusieurs parlent.   Un mardi soir..c'était bondé ...tsé il y avait très peu ou pas de table vide qu'on pouvait voir à partir de la vitrine qui donne sur Ste-Catherine.  Mais bon vu que ça avait d'l'air cool..je suis rentré avec mon amie. Les 2 hôtesses me disent de laisser le manteau au vestiaire..qu'il n'y a pas de charge et tout. C'est ce que je fais. Je n'étais pas habillé pour sortir et 0 maquillage, bref je n'étais pas le client cible et sa paraissait.  Les 2 hôtesses me demandent si j'ai une réservation, je dis non, elles essaient de trouver une table...et je leur dit...Mais je veux juste prendre un verre. Alors une hôtesse nous dit..ah alors je vais vous amener au bar.   Mais oui toi...je ne savais pas qu'il y avait un beergarden derrière avec des sofas, des plantes, des tables de pool, des petits plats et de l'alcool!   On demande un pichet de bière au bar. 18$ pour le pichet et plusieurs format...on a pris le plus gros. La serveuse super mais super sympathique.  Elle nous a demandé si c'était notre première fois ..nous a parlé du menu etc etc. La carte de mon amie avait un problème..j'ai donc dû aller chercher ma carte au vestiaire pour payer. La chère barmaid blonde aux cheveux long bouclé a été hyper compréhensible et zéro stress.   Comme on avait déjà manger avant on avait pas faim, mais les plats sentaient hyper bon!! C'est sûre et certains que j'y retourne. J'aimerai ça y retourner plus tard en soirée..tse quand la musique forte commence et le monde est drunk et la piste de dance se forme..! Reste à voir si c'est vrai qu'ils sont si select le soir et autant rempli comme les autres avis le mentionne!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty. Love the Amazonian look. The service seems confused. We were introduced to one waitress but then served by another waitress throughout of our stay. The drink were very good, but the food presentation was not appealing. The taste was strictly ok. During our dinner, the busboy kept coming to clean the table for little drops of food or drinks that it was really becoming annoying, plus you can smell the residue of the cloth. I would recommend the place only for drinks."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, très grand et très stylé, avec beaucoup de plantes La bouffe est bonne de ce que j'ai entendu dire (tacos) Par contre, ce qui me freine beaucoup est le prix des boissons: 12$ pour une bière, ça fait un peu cher! A ce prix là, on n'a pas forcément envie d'en prendre plusieurs... Dommage!"}
{"text":"Fun bar but the bouncers are psychopaths and the lines on the weekend are NOT worth it. Went on a Friday night with a group of girl friends, heard one of the bouncers make multiple racist comments about people in line, and verbally harassed multiple women in line as well. If you go for dinner/drinks the inside of the place is big and has a good vibe with decent food, but I will never give my money to a place that hires people like the guys they have working the door there. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Small plates but with lots of flavour. A little pricey for what it is and the ambiance doesn't quite make up for it. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"It is not the place to get drunk but to enjoy and relax with its spectacular vibe and music. On top of that, the food is beyond creative and delicious. I sat down at the bar area, and the server (Sebastian) is extremely professional, easy going, friendly, hot, and know what he is doing. the alcohol (I had cocktail) here is really delicious, but again, it is not for people to be drunk. A fun, vacation- like bar."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10 and it was great! Unquestionably the food I awesome, very awesome. Impressive quality/price ratio. It's in a college area so by 10 it gets crowded with younger peeps, it is what it is. Good drinks, hit and miss on the staff but understandable, it's busy. The ribs, the dumplings and the fried chicken are to die for. Try them, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars on location, décor service and ambiance! It's really amazing from try moment you step inside all the design and decor is really jaw dropping considering the huge size of the place. In terms of the foods it's not terribly expensive however it's not amazing either... Be ready to share because the menu is made that way, it's a lot of small tapas. I tried dumplings, tacos, beef tartare, calamari and the list goes on!!! Mostly crowd favourite bar dishes which is nice and fun for a group. That said mostly too oily and fried foods and can't say anything was really all that great or memorable in fact below average on most dishes so I probably wouldn't go back except maybe for group events. Also won't get into details that my stomach of steel was quite upset after my visit ..."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place, with great selection of drinks, excellent staff and overall great music mix"}
{"text":"Great venue and nice (not unique) concept. The \"cocktails\" are literally full pitchers of ice cubes and the staff who served us was rude"}
{"text":"Despite the beauty of the place and its potential that has to offered... Kampai was pure DECEPTION. Two planned birthdays parties with reservation confirmed were flushed out by being rejected at the door for 60 ppl. Reason was that the place was over maximum capacity. We were 3 lucky of the group that managed get in early and we're waiting for our friends to come in at our reserved spot completely empty. I don't run any bar/restaurant but on a commun sense respectful behavior towards your customers...a minimum could have been done! Kampai management team...Your level of professionalism is to question!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I walk by this building every single day and my roommates and I were super excited for this place to open in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, like other reviewers on here, I was turned away at the door at 10pm on a Thursday under the pretext that they \"were not accepting anyone at the moment.\" I wanted to get a late night snack with a drink or two and the place was clearly empty. I was shocked because it was marketed as a restaurant with hundreds of seats, not as an exclusive bar where you need reservations like apt. 200. Last time I checked, their website didn't even have a phone number to make reservations! Way to get some love from your neighbors guys."}
{"text":"First the food is great. The atmosphere hopping. But it's strange. We had to get a stamp just to walk in. The music was super loud but ok. But the wait staff have rules that are funny. You cannot order your food until the drinks come. And a busboy tried to take a still filled pitcher of margheritas away. Almost causing a fight. Lol. The dishes are really small and expensive. But as I said delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I decided to give this place another chance last night. While the menu options I made yesterday were way better than during my first visit, the restaurant failed to mention whether on their social media channels, a sign on the outside of the resto itself or the bouncers/hostesses that I had to engage with before being seated, that there was a private event starting. Literally, I had to engage with 3 different people before we were seated and no one mentioned it.  The entire point of going back was to enjoy their ambiance and play pool, at the owner's suggestion based on my last review. Because of the private event, we were not allowed to check out the pool table area so once again, it was just a place with small, overpriced plates.   Completely ridiculous. The next time someone suggests going there - I'll make sure we go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is ok, Drinks are good and service is awesome, if you here to drink its good place food, I wont encourage to try it here"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, really feels like apt.200. Ive been 3 times now and my experiences at Kampai started from great to horrible. The food is great but really is like overpriced izakaya food. The drinks taste cheap which is not something you expect from such a beautiful bar.  Most importantly, the last time I attempted to go, they rejected a reservation for a close friend's birthday party. What kind of place accepts a birthday reservation then doesn't let the guests in? It really shows the lack of structure from this place!  Really wanted to like you Kampai, but youre so disappointing."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go to this place after reading some of the reviews. We are SO glad that we did. We were seated right away, the service was excellent,  and the decor was on-point. We ordered a 48 oz pitcher of the Lucky Peach Mojito. I would definitely recommend it!  For food, we ordered the fried tofu, dumplings and kampai hot dog. The hot dog was definitely the star of the show."}
{"text":"Came last week with a few friends, and we were glad to have made reservation. We were promised a table and we did get one.  The food is great and the drinks as well. Great ambience as well.  The only con is its price for what it offers, but its uniqueness speaks for itself and it is worth what we pay.  Be advised, call for a reservation a week in advance even if you are 2 or 4, and call back to reconfirm."}
{"text":"Ambiance : 5/5 Alcool et bière : 3/5  Bouffe : 2/5 et encore...  Nous avons pris:  - la salade thaï : trop salée et manque de subtilité - la salade kampaï : bien goût équilibré - huître frite avec nouille : des nouilles à la sauce Hoisin...très plate. Une huître qui a perdu tout son goût. - le tataki de thon : passable - le tataki de boeuf : passable - le poulet frit : deja vu - les calmars frit: déjà vu - le poke (quinoa et saumon) : très bon, mais où est le saumon - les frites maison : patate en julienne et bien assaisonnée  - les edamames : ça reste des haricots...mais très bon  Et avec tout ça ... je reste sur ma faim...compte tenu du prix et du manque de saveur...  J'y retournerais pour un 5@7 seulement."}
{"text":"30$ the largest pitches mojito only can share with 5 little glass....edamame cost 8$.... we almost eat nothing there but cost 140 in total... won't come back again cause the price is too high to afford it"}
{"text":"There's no guest list at kampai. The bar is completely empty and the line to get in is over an hour. They try to make this an exclusive place but it's really not. The bouncers are all disrespectful.The drinks are okay but the sangria leaves a bad after taste."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, very big and good service but very cheap and expensive.  Sorry but I can't recommend this place.  They don't have any real meals only taps that are really small. The entire point of the restaurant is to share but how can you share a tiny plate that I wouldn't even call a taster.  I had to admit the calamari and the spicy sweet potato are good but drink price and portions are a joke."}
{"text":"I went with our meetup group of friends... We ordered many of their plates the tapas style, we shared everything, even the drinks... I can tell some of the plates were amazing and we ordered same plates again, such as the shrimp tacos, the fried calamari, and the tartar of meat. But others we did not like. The service was very good and friendly.   May be it was before their rush hour or so, because we were already done by 9pm. We came at 7pm and left at 9pm and it was ok. By the time we left we saw a long line-up in front of the main door, and lots of cars waiting for the valet parking service provided by them.  I recommend it for the early evening, but I do not definitely recommend it for after that, it will be too crowded and definitely the service will not be as good."}
{"text":"Had such a great time at Kampai. Amazing atmosphere and great music. I haven't been for dinner yet but I'm going to be giving it a try really soon! I'll definitely be back for the music :)"}
{"text":"So glad we found this restaurant! As a New Yorker traveling in Montreal, I definitely recommend it to tourists for the ambiance and drinks! Love love love the ramen (no soup base) and their rum drinks! On the flip side, the shrimp tacos and the yakitori were okay, nothing special.  They did have amazing r&b throwbacks from the 90s! (Music is too loud to bring your parents)"}
{"text":"Went there for a small birthday diner with friends and the vybe was pretty chill along with good music. We ordered salmon tataki which was good but pricey 12$ for 3 pieces, both regular and sweet potato fries along with two orders of fry chicken. I don't understand how you are suppose to \"share\" these plates when the portion is so small and overpriced. The pitcher we ordered was full of ice with barely any actually cocktail inside so we decided to add extra shots into it which didn't make much of a difference because it was so watered down. The service was amazing until our waiter started to be super pushy towards the end and repeatedly tried to convince us that we should order our drinks at the table instead of at the bar where we wanted to play pool (obviously to increase the bill thus his tip) which was a total deal breaker for me to never come back. I highly do not recommend, from the food to the drinks nothing was out of this world for me & this place is definitely overrated."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying Montreal is an amazing city with lots of night life and great restaurants and I try to go as often as I can. We stayed at the gouvenuer hotel and decided to venture out we found this spot and decided to go in. We sat down at the bar and waited about 10 mins to get asked if we wanted something.... with that being said it was an empty bar it should of been almost instantly. The server approached us and handed us menus with a couple glasses of water, and asked if we wanted drinks? Obviously we wanted drinks we were sitting there for 10 mins.... we order the sangria which was mediocre it came in a plastic jug and and was very bland... over all nice place and this the reason for the 3 stars however I don't think we will return..."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot to hang out in Montreal! It has a variety of seating including bar chairs, sofas and lounge areas. It's a fun blend of industrial and tropical for different types of outings. Before 11pm, it's a restaurant/bar where people can sit down and grab a bite. The pool tables are open then. After 11, the music gets louder, the pool tables are closed, and it turns to a club-y vibe.  It's a place where people can feel comfortable to hang out. There are dressed up crowds, as well as casual people.  I haven't tried the food yet, but the drinks are quite interesting. There are beer selections, as well as cocktails to share. They come in pitchers of 32, 48 and 60oz. You can really taste the alcohol in the cocktails. :P The place does get super crowded so it's recommended to make a reservation before you go!"}
{"text":"Love their poke bowls, edamame, the drinks, the atmosphere and the decor! Service is also always great."}
{"text":"First and last time I go, bad servive and horrible management.    My party and I had to wait over 45 minutes to get in even if we had a reservation made 2 weeks before and they called to confirm we were still coming 2 days ago.   When we finally made it in. The tables we had reserved weren't available anymore and we had to stick to the crowded bar.  What's the point of booking a reservation if you still have to do the line up and your table is simply handed to another group?"}
{"text":"Wanted to go in for a drink and maybe some snacks with 3 friends (the place was basically empty at this point) but the hostess was quick to inform us that they were full for the night in the rudest tone possible. Never heard of a bar where you need reservations to have a drink. Based on this incredible first impression, I'm not sure I'll even bother trying to go back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool spot. We made reservations to get a table for a Friiday night at 9 pm(the only other option was 11:30). The place wasn't packed when we sat down, but our waiter was really attentive.   We ordered a medium sized pitcher of the rose sangria(which was FULL of ice) and didn't give us a buzz whatsoever. I would recommend a large for 2 people.... and maybe to ask for less ice.  We also ordered the 2 mini desserts which were chocolate pudding in a mason jar and some white vanilla pudding. They were $4 CAD each and pretty good.   Got 4 tequila shots for $20 CAD as well which was great.  The overall vibe of the place is really cool and when we were leaving around midnight, the line to get in wrapped AROUND the block"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out after one of the lovely staff from Atelier New Regime recommended it to me and my friends. The interiors were lovely--I'd have to experience this spot during the summer time because I'm sure it's gorgeous. Besides the sweet decor, the food was pretty good. We were a group of five and shared a ton of plates. The most memorable one for me was definitely the Black Beans Noodles!   I'd come back here for patio drinks and I love how the back turns into a little bar x pool hall."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal from NYC and thought this place looked cool. The ambience is all it has going for it. We ordered a pitcher of tequila drinks which tasted musty as well as an array of apps. The brussels sprouts were not cooked or roasted as billed, ahi tuna came lukewarm. Fried chicken was just plain *off*. The only highlight was the dumplings which were delicious.   Come here for an Instagram pic, don't stay for the food."}
{"text":"D'abord, l'endroit est vraiment beau! C'est une très belle place pour flasher et prendre des selfies! haha  Par contre, le service était si long (et nous étions assis au bar), que nous avons failli partir. Nous n'avons commandé que des drinks, qui étaient bons, mais sans plus (surtout cher); je ne peux donc pas juger la nourriture! Mais la première impression que j'ai eu ne me donne pas du tout le goût d'y retourner, malheureusement!"}
{"text":"Over hyped,  over  priced, prime example of a chef's reputation leading to an absence of quality of service. Save your money."}
{"text":"I decided to go and try out Kampaï on a Wednesday night to see what's all the hype about it on social media. It's only been two weeks since Kampaï opened his doors.  We were a party of 8 and got there around 8:30 and immediately were assigned to our table. The place is really big and vast and is broken down in different sections, there is a bar, a section rather calm, an other one next to the open kitchen with high tables and sofas as well as a nice bar at the back with pool tables. The interior is really nice and the way it is structured makes Kampaï a convenient  place whether you want to have dinner, go for a 5 a 7 or even for drinks later.   We sat down at the table and when we asked for coat check, the hostess informed us that it was not available at the moment but they will have the feature pretty soon.  We then proceeded to the order, their menu consists of plates to share, salads, sides and deserts as well as some cocktails. We decided to order and share everything so that we can try and taste as many items as possible. We had the pogos,tempura, tuna tataki, beef tataki, dumplings as well as the noodle salad and the fresh salmon and tuna salad with rice and other items. The food arrived very quickly (they started serving within 10 minutes of the order). The portions were fair, neither too big nor too small compared to the prices, however some plates failed to impress me and the rest of the table; the fresh tuna and salmon salad with rice and quinoa lacks composure and balance with too much rice and vegetables and not enough fish, the tuna tataki was a little fade and the noodles salad was good but too much salt. I really enjoyed the dumplings, the tempura and the code.  Even though the food arrived very quickly the manager offered us some complimentary dishes on the house to apologize for the delays (we thought that maybe he confused us with another table) and it was a really nice gesture from him."}
{"text":"Great bar / restaurant. The food and drinks are very tasty and there are a few options that are made to share. A prefect spot for a date night, an outing with friends, or a 5 à 7."}
{"text":"Disappointed in management. Left us waiting for 30 min and then didn't let our party in when we reserved 2 weeks in advance. If you could not accommodate a large group it's important to last us know in advance instead of ruining a birthday. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"'basic in 2 weeks'  moi et mon ami avions entendu parler du nouveau restaurant d'Antonio Park, et c'est ce qui a motivé notre visite.  Assis directement au bar, nous avons eu un excellent service de notre barmaid, qui était très souriante et chaleureuse. À un point même où nous nous sommes demandé si elle pensait que nous étions critiques de restaurant !  Concernant le menu, il s'agit d'avantage 'd'appetizers' que de repas principal: 2-3 salades, un poke, des trucs frits. Bon pour une entrée de 5a7 ou une fin de soirée. Rien de bien spécial, un menu ordinaire et déjà vu.  l'ambiance était bonne, autant pour prendre un verre que jouer une partie de billard entre amis. Sur ce point, je n'ai pu m'empecher de remarquer que le décor ressemble en tout point à celui du Fitzroy sur le Plateau. La différence se situe dans la crowd qui fréquente l'endroit, un peu moins étudiante au Kampaï.  Bref, un restaurant un peu décevant qui ne fera pas beaucoup jaser et qui perdra de sa nouveauté sous peu. On y retourne pour un 5a7.   IMPORTANT  - réservez avant de venir. Impossible de même s'asseoir au bar sans avoir appelé 20 min d'avance."}
{"text":"Sad to say, this place had potential but really messed up with their reservation. Let people freezing outside and almost ruined our night. Its convenient it was in downtown so we were able to go elsewhere after receiving a bad service and was treated poorly."}
{"text":"We had wonderful time at Kampai. The service was great and very attentive.  The food was quite delicious too. The fact that we visited at 6pm on Saturday certainly helped as there were less customers and the usual line up to enter Kampai starts later. The restaurant and bar are truly occupying a huge space and managing the place must be an impressive operation.   We kept our drink interests simple and limited to pints of beer, there were nice varieties on tap. The food is of tapas style, our hostess explained all the specials and popular dishes from the menu in details. She recommended to order only few dishes at a time as to avoid clutter on the table and slowly enjoy the menu. The beef tacos were pretty good as well as the Bahia salald, but if you'd like to keep it simple just order sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo and edamame with Montreal barbecue spice, both are divine and perfect snack for drinks. Another enjoyable dish was one of the daily specials, marinated whiting, well prepared and served with toasted very thin slices of bread. I believe my friends ordered almost every dish from the menu and raved about most of them. We also ended up with two complimentary servings of papas due to misunderstanding of our order, this dish I can best describe as fried mashed potatoes with salmon or beans in the middle or whatever else the chef would like to add, frankly I was less impressed with it.   Sometimes in the middle of our dinner we were approached if everything is Ok and if we have any recommendations how to improve Kampai. My only comment is I would love to have paper table cloth or cover for the table we were seated at as the surface was a little bit scratched, but here I'm really nit-picking. In the end we collectively concluded Kampai is a place we would gladly come back."}
{"text":"Speed with which we were welcomed and asked for our order: 5/5 Food: 3.5/5. Quite tasty, spicy, lots of dipping sauce. However it's a kind of food that I'll forget the taste of the next day. It's above average but too expensive for what you get. Also the drink cocktail was quite a watery let down.  Service at table: fast. However maybe too fast. My plate was cleared as I was taking my last bite. That was not great. Also it was very hard to get the attention of the waiter/waitress when help was needed. 2.5/5 Atmosphere: loud pub vibe but we could still hear each other. 5/5 To sum up. It's a nice place, but too expensive for the value. There are much better places"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 9pm for a group of 6 and honestly that's the way to go if you're trying to go here as a late-night bar - when we walked out at 10:30pm there was a line of people waiting to get in.   It's a drinks and small plates place. Food is good but I'd recommend going if you're not super hungry! Noodles were my fave dish. Love their pitchers to share!"}
{"text":"Attention to Kampai Manager.  A couple months ago my friends and I wanted to pass by and check out this place. Your staff was friendly and helpful, the crowd was amazing, and the decor was on point. In my humble opinion, your signature alcohol drinks were extremely weak. I suggest you perhaps reviewing the recipe and alcohol portion. Regardless this place did not stop me for wanting to organize my birthday party in summer 2017- I truly believed in your business. I left that night satisfied and only said great thing to my friends about your business.    Unfortunately, last night completely changed my perspective of your business and staff- something must've happened because 60 of my guest for our birthday party was refused at the door. This reservation was made beginning of December and we received a phone call Wednesday, January 4th to confirm our reservation. We indeed confirmed for 60 people.   If someone should take responsibility, here is a description of your staff who initially took the reservation: Tall, slim-figure, wearing glasses, late 20s early 30's.  Last night entrance was entirely a huge mess and I have a video that i can provide to you upon request. What happened?   Our guests were told by your bouncer to wait outside, in the cold- again this reservation WAS confirmed, yet my guests had to wait under -20 degrees for over 45 minutes? Let me remind you that our table was ready and the birthday girl was inside waiting for us.   Shortly after, we started realizing that none of us was able to get in because according to one of your staff, there is no reservation made after 11.   Again, we are talking about a reservation that was CONFIRMED for 60 people.  So the birthday girl @natalie pham stood up from her reserved table and left.   Here is a personal message for your bouncer last night:   Regardless of your job description, you had absolutely no right to aggressively push my girlfriend. I can empathize with your frustration, having to deal with your surrounding and the people- but goddamn learn how to control your emotions. Literally shoving my girlfriend was not an answer, she was just trying to leave Kampai and apologize to her 60 guests that were waiting outside for her.    So dear Manager of Kampai, I am genuinely so disappointed in your business and how things were handled last night. Please have a meeting with your staff and restructure the business. Your staff is the image of potential future business.  I was honestly excited to throw my birthday party this summer. Ask anybody, 16 bottles of alcohol and magnums at Soubois- my friends know exactly what I expect from staffs and friends. I genuinely do not ask for much, except for treating my guest with kindness and fairness.    And Kampai, you failed on every single aspect.    Amongst all 60 people on the guest list, you have rejected doctors, pharmacist, lawyers, business owners, restaurant workers and owners and last but not least: passionate foodies.   Not only have you lost me as your current and future client, but you left a disgustingly bad taste to all my guests.    I hope this was a lesson for you as much as it was for me.  Our entourage is immense, and unfortunately bad news spread fast.    As for me, you will no longer receive a single penny or investment until the situation gets cleared."}
{"text":"Great vibes if you're young. Really good for groups and had nice simple dishes, love the drinks heres!!"}
{"text":"I've heard lots of hype about this place, then heard negative comments about the service and so just kinda pushed it on the side of my list for a later time.  It is right next to my work now so a couple of weeks ago when it was really sunny, my colleagues and I decided we'd go have lunch outside. As Kinka was completely full on the terrace, we popped over to Kampai instead. It was almost empty, with maybe 2-3 tablea occupied. So I figured we were in for it....   To my surprise, the food was actually quite good, service was nice because there was pretty much no one (lol!!). It is a little higher priced than other Japanese restaurants around but the quality felt better and we were quite happy with what we got: Grilled hot bowl and Poke bowl.   I'd come back again for a sunny lunch on the terrace :)"}
{"text":"We came here as a large group for drinks on a Friday night. I was a little disappointed with the experience , especially after i had heard so many good things about Kampai garden. The good points were that our reservation was honoured and we were seated immediately upon arrival , which was nice and the decor inside is absolutely gorgeous, its casual and elegant at the same time and feels very inviting. Theres lots of space inside and is a nice venue for a group or a date. The atmosphere is very lively and energetic without being too loud, our whole table was able to have a conversation without feeling like we had to talk over music or too much noise. The issue everyone seemed to have was the price of the pitchers of beer for their size and the fact that the house made cocktails had way too much ice and were very sweet. A few people ordered some small food items which they said they enjoyed (id like to try the food myself next time around and add that to my review). Our servers for the most part were very friendly but we had to remind them a few times before they brought us water (understandable this can happen given how busy the place was on a Friday). However, we were coming up on the end of our allotted time slot for our tables and we had to ask multiple times for our bills so that we could clear the area and respect the time frame and while waiting we had a staff member come and tell us in a very rude manner that we had to leave the table right away. We tried to explain that we were just waiting for our bills so we can pay and go but his tone remained the same. This kind of ruined the experience especially when we were simply waiting with our jackets on to pay our bills for a group of about 15 people. But I dont want to let one person ruin the whole place for me , so I definitely want to give Kampai another chance, likely with a smaller group."}
{"text":"It was my wife birthday dinner, her first birthday since we're married.  For the occasion I've made a reservation 24h ahead online and got a confirmation by email and SMS.  When we got there, we were squeezed into a small corner. A few moment after we sat down, the hottest came back said she wanted us to change to a better table. I was really happy and appreciated the offer.  The food is just meh... Not surprising at all, didn't had the WOW factor.  The food... Taste is okay... But the presentation is so random. Good thing the light were dimmed otherwise the beef tartar would killed the appetite.  Overall, the atmosphere is great and the service was stunning.  I do think, they have a lot to improve in their menu and their food.  Thanks."}
{"text":"This resto bar is pretty big! I liked the vibe and it was happening on a Friday night. We had dinner at 9 pm and ordered what the waitress recommended. The highlight of the night was the beef tacos. OMG!! It was so good! The meat was so juicy and full of flavour that it really didn't need all the stuff on top like the slaw for example. We ordered the shrimp tacos too but it was nothing special. The beef tacos really stole the show. We ordered it twice. Because we were three people at first I asked if they could  add an additional taco since the plate only came with two tacos but they didn't want to. They seemed very strict about not changing the menu even the drink menu! We ordered two cocktails in pitcher format (60 oz) and they were both so watered down. We asked for them to add an additional four shots of gin to it. We ordered the Baby Girl What's Your Name (Jameson, sour mix litchi and lavender, cranberry, tonic, and lime juice ) followed by Lucky Peach (Beefeater, peach, ginger, ginger beer and mint).  We asked for them to make the pitchers stronger and put less ice in them but all they were willing to do was just add more juice. That's so not what we wanted. :( The drinks tasted good but would have been much better if we could taste and feel the alcohol. We then decided to order a bottle of sake to play it safe.   Now back to the food... we also ordered the maple salmon salmon sashimi. I liked it. It wasn't sweet like you would imagine it to me. The Kung pao beef Tartare was pretty good too. I wish they gave more bread with the Tartare. The pork dumplings and the shrimp pogos were meh. The latter had too much batter and not enough shrimp. I don't recommend either of them.   The crowd is very young (early to mid twenties) but I guess its expected since it is close to Concordia university. I won't lie, I felt old. It probably wouldn't have been an issue if the cocktails hadn't been so watered down and I had a good buzz going lol."}
{"text":"Je suis allé mangé samedi au Kampai Garden et je n'ai vraiment pas été déçue! Quand j'ai appelé pour réserver il y a 2-3 semaines, j'étais très septique. On a seulement voulu nous réserver 12 places et on m'a mentionné que nous aurions la table seulement pour 2 heures. En raccrochant j'ai pus réserver 4 autres places en ligne... Finalement en arrivant tout s'est bien déroulé, ils ont accepté d'ajouter 2 chaises à notre table principale et tout le monde a pus s'assoir ensemble. Et nous avons eu la table pour 3 heures! Le service était parfait!! Le serveur était présent et à l'écoute le service de l'alcool était super rapide et les plats arrivaient à un bon rythme nous permettant de tout apprécier sans se sentir pressé!   C'est un menu à partager donc mon copain et moi avons partagé 6 plats. Tout était bon, les portions étaient convenables pour le prix (surtout les salades et le ramen au boeuf). J'ai adoré tout tout tout! Surtout le décor wow!   Vers 9h30 on a quitté la table pour se diriger du côté bar.. tout était parfait aussi! On apprécie les tables de pool en soirée et l'ambiance club plus tard aussi! 5* bien mérité! :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with some friends and it was all our first time coming here. It's a good place to hang out, have some drinks, and relax. There is, however, nothing too special about the food (for the exception of their fried chicken!), and most of the items on their menu are a bit overpriced in my opinion. The service was a bit slow, we had to ask our waitress about our order before finally getting it. Their drinks, however, are too beautiful to drink (shoutout to the bartender!)... a little goes a long way (they're strong! do drink with moderation)."}
{"text":"I don't know how good the food is there, but their cocktails are delish! It's a cute, nicely decorated place which I heard is popular spot for dancing later in the evening. Downstairs, they have a super fun bar with reasonably priced cocktails (almost a liter for $20 is a bargain)! They also have pool table which makes it a perfect spot if you're in a group consisting of drinkers and pool players or just feel like enjoying a yammy drink while playing pool. I have to go back and try their food now!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Kampai after the huge hype we've been hearing all over the news/internet. After about 10x trying to contact this restaurant for a simple reservation, I decided to give up on this place. I haven't even walked into the restaurant and I already got a bad impression. First, I called at 2pm and left a message to reserve since they only open at 5 pm. Then, they called back but I wasn't able to answer. By the time I called back, they still didn't answer and so I left another message.  Then, I went to Facebook to make my reservation through their FB page. They answered saying that someone would contact me, but they never did. I decided to call the place the night that I was planning to go (yesterday) myself after 5pm. I called the place about 5 times after 5pm and no one was able to answer the phone. They really need to organize their reservation strategy. Maybe try online reservations (ex: opentable) ? Anyway, due to the experience of trying to reserve to eat here, I will not be going / trying Kampai Garden. DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"I've been to Kampai Garden twice and I really enjoyed the food, especially the fried shareable ones, such as the fried chicken and  fried tofu. I also loved the miso cod, but found it harder to share with more than two people as it sits in a savoury soup. The pokebowl was decent and the duck tataki was mediocre. As for the rolls and tacos, they are also great for sharing, but didn't blow my mind away. I don't think that the value is great as the dishes are pricey considering the amount served, but  overall, the food is good and the environment is nice. I would happily hang out with friends here."}
{"text":"Came here with another Yelp Elite friend and I must say that I really enjoyed my time here. It was smack in the middle of 5 a 7 and I was whisked to some prime seats at the bar straight away by a very cheerful hostess. This place is HUGE, like, massive. The decorating is lovely and unique and there is a lot of huge windows letting in natural light and the various sections range from rowdy, to intimate to classy. We were by the pool tables and had a great bartender who answered our many questions. Had some appies: shrimp pogo and calamari both of which were tasty but not especially out of this world or anything.  The only reason why I am knocking a star off is that I think the prices are a bit high for what it is and some things on the sharing menu only come with something like 1 oyster, how are you supposed to share an oyster exactly?? Also, the cocktails: they come by the pitcher, so if you're flying solo, you're going to get fairly wasted (not that that's a bad things necessarily, but come on!)"}
{"text":"After a misunderstanding with management and the bouncers, Kampai was incredibly accommodating and understanding, and so we gave it another shot.  All of the food was amazing - there was not a single dish that disappointed, but the highlights were the oysters (sooo fresh), the cauliflower, the tuna tataki, the ribs and the fried chicken.  Their pitchers of cocktails were also so yummy, pretty, and quite strong. We had the passion fruit, the peach, the moon rush colada, the Lime mojito, and the Tokyo grapefruit (which is the only one we didn't really enjoy).  All in all, the experience exceeded my expectations and really changed my view of Kampai. The only caveat I have is that the plates are small and meant to be shared, so it can get pricey pretty quickly. Otherwise, the decor was beautiful, the servers friendly and helpful, and the food just absolutely delicious.   Also, apparently Alexis Ren was there at the same time, but we didn't see her."}
{"text":"My friend reserved for two on a friday for 8pm. We arrived at 7:55pm and were told that our reservation was at 7pm. However, the hostess told us to wait to see if they can give us a table which is what we did. After 15min, we finally got a place to sit.  The night didn't start that well, but luckily, we had a really nice waitress who was pretty available to our questions and our table was always cleaned-up when we finished our plates. As for the food, it was alright. The price, meh. The portion, meh. But they are tapas so I can't complain about it.  The drink... this is probably what make me give them a 3 stars... I enjoyed their cocktail pitcher but the amount of ice vs the cocktail itself... it's a total rip-off. Also, Kampai is described as a beer bar, however, there is no beer menu (actually, we were told it is still under revision). So if you want to know about their beers, you must ask the waitress/waiter.  Also, expect a good 10-20min wait for a (free) coat check.   I'll come back, but probably during summer just to avoid the coat check or way in the future just because I feel like there is still some improvement they can make, especially when it comes to their reservations systems or staff communications."}
{"text":"Guess Canadians don't Yelp? This spot would be like a 4.5 in the US for sure.   Sum it up: Like a Midtown NYC spot, beautiful people (staff + customers), friendly/prompt, high quality food and drinks.   No brainer. Poke in for food or the after party."}
{"text":"This place do not care if you reserve for a birthday party, they will just treat you like shit and leave u speechless at the door. Avoid everyone!"}
{"text":"Tres correct, bonne ambiance et decoration, assiettes honnetes, plusieurs tables et grande vitrine qui sert de terrasse."}
