{"text":"The McMurray location looks great.  Potato Pancake Reuben is awesome, a tasty twist to a sandwich.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Tiny casual restaurant with a very accommodating chef. I am gluten free and though they do not have a gluten free menu he came out and helped me choose a meal that would be good for me."}
{"text":"I would be leery about ordering a salad or any type of vegetable from Open German Italian Flair.  I placed a pick-up order for a garden salad with seared salmon and a side order of roasted beet.  The garden salad with seared salmon is one of the more expensive dishes on the menu, around $10.00 and some change. When I opened up my salad it was iceberg lettuce that was wilted and slightly browning around the edges, the only other vegetables in this meager looking salad were 2 black olives and maybe 2 cucumber sliced diced into small pieces.  Let's not forget that there must have been a quarter cup of black olive juice that the lettuce was swimming in.  As for the \"seared salmon\"...well there were several small pieces that looked like they probably came out of a can of water.  The smell was awful and so was the taste.  I asked for a vinaigrette dressing and got something along the lines of creamy Italian.  When I decided after several bites that I was not going to eat this salad I moved on to the roasted beets.  The beets were way over salted to the point where I couldn't even take another bite.  The salt was visible all over.  I called to speak to the owner who happened to be the chef who prepared the meal and he was very apologetic and offered to give me a credit for the next time I returned or offered to refund my money upon my return to the restaurant.  I really do not have any desire to return or order another meal based on this experience and also becasue I am limited to what I can eat on the menu. Overall it was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good place but very small.  takes awhile to get the service plus your order.  Will probably not go again.  Table had mixed emotions.  Half going back, half not."}
{"text":"Place is a hidden treasure!  Everything is so good!  Their Rueben is the best rueben I have EVER had!  Seriously, no Reuben ever comes close.  I've never had a bad meal there and the serving sizes are enormous.  Fridays during Lent are always incredibly busy as their fish sandwich is to die for."}
{"text":"After hiking in Mingo we decided to try out this new restaurant.  I ordered a Reuben and it was good.  My friends wanted to split a sandwich and we told that it was a $6 upcharge.  What?  I've never heard of charging to split a sandwich.  Maybe a fancy restaurant in a big city might have an upcharge but this restaurant is under a post office in the middle of nowhere.  The seats are simply wooden benches and the owner's kid (maybe age 2-3) greeted us at the door and was a bit of a pest during our meal.  It was hardly a fancy dining experience.  My other friends both had a sausage sandwich and they said it was only fair at best.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be back.  Too bad, because it is very close to home and the area is devoid of restaurants."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my son and I was very impressed, the food was great and the service was excellent.  Went back the following week with my husband and our dinner was equally as good. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!! True German food and very personal service.  You choose your meat entr√©e and sides from a large selection of German basics.  We choose potato salad, sauerkraut and red cabbage; all were excellent.  The Bremen platter had pork loin, wiswurst and bratwurst."}
{"text":"Enjoyed. Will go back.  Cozy informal place, byob, reasonable prices, attentive staff.  Reuben 8.50 w side of slaw, very lean, good bread from Cibrones, enough to bring some home.   Behind post office on Venetia Rd.  Sandwiches $5.50 and up.   Pasta $9 and up.  Some dinners $12-14."}
{"text":"Had the reuben, the bread was burnt, hardly any saurkraut or cheese.   the meal was lousy and they took the sandwich off of the bill but charged me $2.50 for the 3 tablespoons of coleslaw that came with the meal.  Very poor taste on their part if you ask me.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came to Open for the first time Saturday night around 6:00 PM.  The place is tiny, I think maybe 10 tables.  It was not packed, which was good for us, but maybe not for the restaurant...being Saturday at 6 and all.  The menu is BIG and very diverse.  Anything from sandwiches to veal to burgers.  We got the fried zucchini, which honestly didn't have much taste to it, but I will say the marinara was delicious.   I ended up getting the Italian open sandwich for dinner, which was HUGE and loaded with meats.  It was good, but not excellent.  It was actually a little too big to eat very well.  The fries were delicious.  Overall, I liked the place, because I like places that have a wide variety but I will need to try more on the menu to get a real feel for it."}
{"text":"This small place which is BYOB and accepts credit cards is located in the basement of the Venetia Post Office around the backside facing the Railroad tracks.  This place has fewer than ten tables, and accepts reservations for parties of 5 or more.  The overall feel of the restaurant is somewhat divey -- the dirty and missing ceiling tiles don't help the decor.  You come here for the food, not the ambiance.  The service I found friendly but full of excuses.  \"I only work here one day a week.\" Or \"This is my second job.\"  Friendly or not, I just don't buy the rationalization that somehow it's acceptable to deliver borderline service. The waiter had to come back and clarify what we ordered a couple times because he couldn't read this writing.  He couldn't identify which 'wurst was which. In a German restaurant. 'nuff said.  The menu is large, consisting of mostly German and Italian dishes.  There are also sandwiches, which were very reasonably priced.  The overall prices were reasonable, but the portions were on the small side.  The VALUE of everything seems just odd -- somethings are a great deal, and somethings are overpriced.  We had three appetizers: the sausage and poblano peppers, which was tasty, the potato pancakes also good, and the fried zucchini which was a big thumbs down.  The long triangular cut zucchini weren't cooked long enough to soften them, and the breading barely adhered to the vegetable.  I MUCH prefer the thinner sliced and lightly fried zucchini at a place like Franco's in Dormont.  The entrees were good, including the previously-mentioned-too-hard-to-identify \"Wurst case scenario\", three worsts.  I chose it over sauerkraut with red cabbage on the side.  The sides were very good in general.  The ultimate sampler, which we chose the schnitzels and the pork loin were very good, but again small portion sized for the price.  The Jaegerschnitzel with mushroom sauce was by far the best thing I tasted off of their menu and I would order it again.  When we asked for bread, they took a loaf of generic white bread out of the freezer, defrosted it in the microwave, and served us that.  Surely they can do better than that!  While I'd like to give this place four stars, I just can't bring myself to do it.  The service (strike one), the ambiance (strike two), the inconsistent food quality(strike three), and questionable value(strike four) just has too many problems for a four-star restaurant.  The majority of the flavors and originality of the dishes has me intrigued, and we will likely go back to give it another shot.  If my experience improves next time, then I'll update my review accordingly.  Total Cost for four, not including tax, tip, or drinks (BYOB), but including appetizers, a couple salads, bread (ahem), (5) entrees, and one dessert: $125."}
{"text":"Open is open for business in a location that is a bit hard to find. It is actually in the floor BELOW the Venetia post office. To get to it, you turn onto Sugar Run road from Venetia Rd and then turn to the parking lot on the left. Once you find it, you will find a nice little cozy restaurant with a combination German/Italian menu and a chef that is committed to doing things the right way. The feel of the place is almost of a diner, so do not expect anything very extravagant as far as the decor goes. Also, it is a BYOB, so bring your own if you're interested in alcooholic drinks.  The main reason to go to a restaurant, of course, is the food. And in this, Open excels! When you take a look at the menu you will see a long column of German dishes, a middle column of sandwiches and burgers, and a column of Italian dishes.  All the standards are present from Lasagna, Ravioli, Bacon Cheddar Burgers and the like, but the more unique part of the menu is the German menu. There are not a lot of places around Pittsburgh that serve German food at all, and this one has many of the favorites. For instance: six different versions of Schnitzels; three different Wursts; Potato Pancakesl Spaetzle; and, of course, Sauerbraten. For those who want to experience different things, there are combination plates that allow you to mix and match.  Our party of four was interested in trying many things so two of us got combination plates while a third got the traditional Italian dish of Chicken Marsala. The final member of our group trie the Potato Pancake Reuben. This last was a traditional Reuben sandwich where instead of the bread, the corned beef and sauerkraut were placed between two potato pancakes. It was quite delicious as the place makes its own Corned Beef. Actually, most everything is made on the premises from scratch. We had a chance to speak with the chef and he shared with us his committment to doing everything right from the Corned Beef through to the roasted beets (most excellent); and the sauces. This extends to the whole menu. One of my pet peeves is how hard it is to find people who make the proper Marsala sauce. In some cases I've been given some red or white concoctions and told they were a Marsala sauce (in one especially notable case, the Marsala was somehow converted into a red and green pepper medley!). Here, at Open, it was done properly and you could taste the Marsala wine flavor and had plenty of mushrooms on a perfectly sauteed chicken.  I can go on and on about how good the food was, but instead I will encourage you to go and try it for yourselves. The prices are incredibly reasonable with the total tab for our party - which included the main dishes and several sides - was less than $20 per person. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The worst food EVER! I ordered penne, and got angel hair pasta! Their special was lasagna, which was cooked God only knows when then microwaved. My pasta (haha) was a blob. The salad and bread where the highlights of the meal. I can microwave better! I couldn't give ZERO stars, but wish I could. Don't try this hole!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Totally blew my mind! the food was so good and so special! German meatloaf is a must! All the food I ordered were worth the price. The location ain't that great but the food is quite the opposite. Recommend this place to everyone who wants to try out home made food."}
{"text":"Being from Germany food not like home. Potato salat is sweet! In Germany its tangy w/ a sweet n sour taste."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with we once had a great experience a few months ago at their now closed second location, so we were excited to bring our kids this time around.   We were big fans of the potato pancake Reuben the first time and this time when my husband ordered it, it was nearly inedible due to how salty it was. My son's potato pancakes that accompanied the Wiener schnitzel were pretty mushy instead of crisp and flavorful and he ended up eating a few bites with applesauce, but left the rest uneaten. The Wiener schnitzel was pretty good. My daughter ordered the wedding soup which she enjoyed. I had the kaese spaetzle which was spaetzle covered in a creamy, gooey Gouda sauce. Everyone at our table liked it and it was finished so that was the clear winner. The helping was generous and the two entrees we ordered came with a pretty standard iceberg lettuce salad. We hoped to order the German potato salad which was really delicious the first time and assumed we'd be able to get it again, but we were told they were out.   We dined on a Saturday evening and there was only one other table with customers, but the food, except for salads and soup, took nearly an hour to come out. Our server was kind and friendly, but given the fact the restaurant was not busy, we were perplexed as to what took so long for food.   Our family was very disappointed in this dining experience."}
{"text":"Open is great! One of our family's favorites. Space is definitely limited, so try calling ahead or getting takeout. Friendly staff. Interesting mix of German/Italian, but it definitely works. I get either the lasagna or one of their schnitzel dishes."}
{"text":"If you want a meal that tastes home cooked perfect and sits well in your stomach, I highly suggest Open. A very small, quiet and hole in the wall place so don't bring a large party. My girlfriend and I usually explore a lot of restaurants to see where you can be serviced truly good food. I moved to Venetia recently and saw a nearby restaurant called Open so I figured what the hell. When you first enter the restaurant it's nothing special to look at but it's not dirty and seems well kept. There is a sign that says \"No cellphones\" but that is merely a joke. I'm was completely unsure of what to get so I got the #1 seller, the potato cake rueben and it was absolutely fantastic. Everything from the corned beef to the sauerkraut to the fried grit styled potato buns were exceptional! Got a side of fries that were taken care of just as well as my main entree. My girlfriend got the build your own pasta with just Cavatappi pasta and Alfredo sauce, the sauce was 100% Home made and made the dish fantastic. I'm happy I have a girlfriend who doesn't mind me eating a lot of food off of her plate, which in this case didn't seem to matter because of the large quantities provided. Now I'm not really that old, I'm 19 so when I walked into this place it had seemed to draw an older crowd (older than me anyway) which I feel sometimes creates an unsaid tension between young and old because young is \"reckless and rude\" (which I am 100% not). This at first made me think I was going to have an awkward and silent dinner with my girlfriend. This wasn't the case at all! The waitress was very down to earth and even the older couple next to us were very nice too! The main cook came out and was the exact same way but even better! The gentlemen was asking us how our meals were, what to try for desert, and even told us what other places to try! This made me very pleased and showed a positive incentive in the ownership and how things are run/done around there. Now lastly for desert, since this is a German Italian place I wanted to get something new like all places I go to. German chocolate cake was the decision and it was pretty damn good. Everything from the chocolate cake itself to the coconut paste that it devoured the desert was interesting but in a good and satisfying way. I had a lot to say because this place deserves it! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch by chance. Seated after several minutes. Received menus after wait of 10 min. Place was very busy. Could only see 2 staff people at that point. Waitress took order after 20 min. Long wait for meal to arrive. Observed several unsanitary practices. Waitress (who turned out to be the cook as one staff member had called off).  She pulled out straws for child's drink and rubbed her hands across the bottom and top trying to find which end went it the top. Observed her pushing coleslaw up into bowl with her hands. Gross and unsanitary. Handed money and set up tables without washing hands I had Reubens sandwich which had so much sauce on it that it bread slid when you tried to bite. Average taste. Not impressed with or one and only visit. Also had to tern cell phones off when you entered. What? I understand that restaurants don't want people talking on phones when visiting there, but having to turn it off, please."}
{"text":"Nice out of the way place to visit with a menu so diverse, it will please everyone in your family! My husband is German, we lived there for 4 years together & our kids have grown up visiting Germany, with his Oma's homemade cooking. The food was really good. The Spaetzle my children ordered was fresh pressed & delicious. The Wiener Schnitzel & Potato Pancakes looked authentic & hubby had no complaints. The Kartoffelsalat is not the authentic German variety, but the sweet PA Dutch type. I went Italian & ordered Wedding Soup & the Caprese Chicken Sandwich. It was delicious! I can't wait to go back & try something new. I know we'll be back many times, their menu is exceptional."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on Friday. I had the fish sandwich, fries, and cole slaw -$10.99. I was very pleased with my meal. Also, I ordered the potato pancakes--3 for $6.95. They were the best that I ever had. For a small place (seating for 30), they are drawing me back with BIG tastes."}
{"text":"I must admit I had my doubts about a restaurant \"specializing\" in both German AND Italian food but my wife suggested we go there.  I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality.  The jaeger schnitzel was pleasantly tender, thick and nicely breaded with a savory, but not overpowering, gravy, sides,  The accompanying roasted beets (made fresh) and a tangy, yet sweet, German potato salad perfectly complemented it.  The homemade, delightfully flaky, apple strudel with a mysterious, delectable drizzle, was a perfect end to the meal. Our server was very attentive (albeit it was a slow night).    There were some minor nits to an otherwise wonderful meal.  First, the lemon in my first iced tea, which was refilled quite attentively throughout the meal, may have not been kept cold enough as evidenced by a slightly carbonated and bitter sensation it imparted to my drink.  Also, the hot bacon dressing was quite heavy on the vinegar which made me unable to taste the almost pulverized bacon pieces mixed in.  They would be better off using recognizable pieces of bacon, a bit of sugar and a lot less vinegar.  Lastly, this is the only time I have ever been to a restaurant where no bread is offered with the meal, which I must admin I am very partial to having, so its absence was noticed.  These concerns will not be enough to keep us from returning (although I may try a different salad dressing next time)."}
{"text":"Open is a very small, family-oriented BYOB restaurant that is hidden underneath the post office.  Nonetheless, we went on a Friday night after making reservations and found it packed.  Having been born and raised in Germany, and not having found any good German restaurants in this area, we were a bit skeptical.  However, we were pleasantly surprised.  We tried, as appetizers, the mussels and potatoe pancakes with all sides, both of which were delicious.  As an entree, we had the Weisswurst, Jaegerschnitzel and Sauerbraten along with the potato salad and red cabbage; Spaetzle with a side of red cabbage; and the mustard-glazed salmon with red beets.  Everything, except for the potato salad, was absolutely fantastic and just like homecooked food in Germany! We couldn't have had a better meal!  The cook came out later and talked to everyone.  All waiters and cooks were super friendly. I would definitely recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"We had eaten at their small restaurant in Venetia and was really happy when they opened another one in McMurray, but last night something happened that really put a bad taste in my mouth. I ordered the large German Ultimate Platter and because I was ordering Red Cabbage as one of my side dishes asked if I could substitute Apple Sauce instead of the Tossed Green Salad. I couldn't believe the response.....our waitress said \"absolutely not, no substitutions under any circumstances!\" I have never in my life heard of something so ridiculous. I could understand if the substitution was a premium cost product, but APPLESAUCE! Our server said, \"our owners made it very clear that we cannot EVER substitute! It was weird and unfortunate as the food was tasty. Gotta be honest....when management is that tight....doesn't bode well. Second thing, all their beer is warm, bottles or tap. Kinda yucky."}
{"text":"Stopped for a bowl of wedding soup.  The soup was loaded with real chicken and other meats.  Much better than your avg wedding soup.  I will return for a real dinner some day - for sure."}
{"text":"We like supporting small businesses, so while traveling through Venetia we decided to give this restaurant a try.  We are definitely glad we did! My husband and I had German food options, while my 11 year old opted for lasagna.  All the foods were homemade, and cooked to perfection.  Our host/waiter was super nice, and helped explain some of the German menu items.  If you're looking for ambiance, this won't be your restaurant-but if you're looking for good food, actually made with care and not mass produced, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Really liked the \"post office\" location in Venetia, but was very disappointed in the new location in Peters.  The salad and bread were great there, but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  We were there on a very quiet weeknight night and still the service was slow.  Our entrees were barely warm and the potato pancakes tastes like there were made several days ago.  Not up to the high standards of the original restaurant...what a shame!  I hope it improves because we really love German food which is hard to find."}
{"text":"Love Open! This place is 5 minutes from our house and even though the food is heavy, it is definitely comforting. They always have a few vegetarian options and the service is friendly and efficient. It does get busy on weekends so you might have to wait. We like telling our friends that we're going to eat a restaurant in the basement of a post office."}
{"text":"The place ia adorable and intimate, the food reviews were mixed amongst our table. Vodka sauce - delicious! Bolognese - ok (not great). Marinara pretty good. Fish - really good! Potato pancakes were pretty good. Service was awesome! They were out of a bunch of stuff we wanted (speatzles amd spinach) so that was disappointing. That is all"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is homemade, the best potato pancakes anywhere, what ever your hungry for is on the menu. True German and Italian dishes made as if you were at a Pub in Germany or Cafe in Italy."}
{"text":"Just awesome food with a very down to earth and friendly staff. Even more awesome is that it is in the basement of a post office. Small inside with big, bold, bright flavors featuring the food of Germany and Italy. You owe yourself this treat!"}
{"text":"New location in McMurray, PA on Center Church road. Open for lunch and dinner. Very good food!!!!"}
{"text":"Awkward, small, and delicious. I would recommend the sauerbraten. It wasn't a perfect dining experience, but I will definitely be back to give it another go."}
{"text":"First time here but I will go back. It is BYOB so I will bring a six pack. Extensive menu of German and Italian entrees plus a good selection of sandwiches. I had the sampler with 3 veal choices. All were excellent. Very light compared to other German restaurants where I have eaten. The potato pancakes were slightly over cooked but still very good. Good sweet and sour cabbage and very good roasted beets.  Entrees come with a salad which had a nice selection of greens, not just iceberg lettuce. The blue cheese dressing was home made and it showed. It was very tasty. The server was very friendly and attentive. The only flaw was not staging the courses well.  I hate it when my entree comes out before I finish my salad but everything else was so good, I didn't hold it against her."}
{"text":"In a world of fast food and chain restaurant, it's a breath of fresh air to have something even somewhat made to order.  The portions were huge, the food flavorful.  The main stays, the pork loin, the schnitzel, the latkes, the pasta sauce, all were terrific.  A ham sandwich at the next table looked and smelled fabulous.   An old, local favorite poplar at all local establishments back in the day is the fish sandwich, they are over the top here.  A personal favorite of mine and brought back fond memories of my childhood when the Mon Valley was hopping.    Yes, you could nitpick, even the finest restaurants you can nitpick, lighten up Francis.   Fabulous food, great local atmosphere, BYOB (a Sauvignon Blanc, pinot gris maybe or a Beaujolais would be great with most things on the menu), if you want a roll with dinner bring it or ask.    It's great to see a good local business presenting a strong offering.  The price is fair, it's not a volume business so if they charge for a role or to split or what ever, it's local and it would be great to keep it that way.    I'm from here but live out of state now and eat frequently in the cities.  I love places with heart and local flavor.  This will be a staple when I come home going forward!"}
{"text":"This place is in the basement of the Venetian post office. It's around back. Anyway, they don't have a ton of seating so don't bring a party larger than 4-5. The place is owned by a couple. One German. The other is Italian. The food is BOTH. I had German. It was awesome!!! My waitress was really cool and knowledgeable. I loved the German food she recommended to me.   This place is BYOB and they don't like cell phones. Give it a shot. It's cool."}
