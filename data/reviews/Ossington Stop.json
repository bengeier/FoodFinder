{"text":"Poor service, treated my friends and I like we didn't exist. Previously it was OK (which is hard to imagine considering it wasn't great in the 1st place) but has degraded in the last 3mos. I'm basing this review mostly on previous experiences, based on this experience I would give it 1/5."}
{"text":"Wooow! I went to Ossington Stop around to 3 times with friends and all times the staff is very very friendly and easygoing. You can order different combinations. 
The owner is the chef. 
The Cabagge Roll is perfect! Is to die!!!!

I really recommend"}
{"text":"We went there on a hot summer night for some good music and some cheap beers and that's just what we got! The bartender was super friendly and the small space allows for conversation with other bar-goers. 
Though early in the evening it was pretty empty we were told that it usually fills up later in the evening, which it did.
Over all, fun intimate atmosphere and great vibe. 
Of note though - they don't do mixed drinks, so you are limited to beer or straight liquor."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite places on on the Ossington strip. While the Ossington Stop has gotten more popular over the years, Dennis's enthusiasm and excellent customer service remains.

The food is still delicious, fresh and homemade. My current favourites are the dumplings, but there are often off-menu specials such as potato salad, crepes and stews.

If you haven't been, you probably should. It can get pretty packed on weekends and it's a relatively small space, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall with beer and perogies what could be bad? I had a very reasonably priced Jameson here and enjoyed the ambiance and friendly service. Seems like there are only 10 seats. The perogies and borsch smelled amazing. I'm keen to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Dennis is a real jerk, certainly not a personality you'd want to know. His cooking abilities are second rate anyways, the place had such great potential when it opened but Dennis let the place slip. When did Russian cuisine become popular? Oh yeah it didn't"}
{"text":"The Ossington Stop will be my new neighbourhood go-to spot for drinks and a meal with friends.  It has a friendly vibe and the food is affordable, healthy, and fresh.

I shared the following things with one other person: stuffed crepe with mushrooms and kale, 2 khinkali dumplings, and borsch. 

Dennis, the owner and operator, is really friendly and flexible.  He served us sweet crepes for dessert even though these aren't on the menu.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best Russian food I've had in the city, cheap drinks, great atmosphere and great people! The music is awesome, owner does a great job trying to accommodate everybody at once. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great and affordable spot for dinner and drinks. The short menu filled with hearty Eastern European classics is an instant win. Do not miss the dumplings. The mac and cheese is covered in fried delicious bits, which will leave you drooling for more."}
{"text":"The Ossington Stop ranks as the top bar near Ossington and Dundas. It's the perfect hang-out with up to 3-4 friends. The food is exceptional! Their cabbage roll is to die for and for $7, just take my money, here - here! The kale salad is also light, refreshing and delicious. Warning: They pour strong drinks! Service is awesome possum.

{"text":"Service:
It's a one man show here, where the owner is the chef, bartender, cashier, and server. He's usually pretty tentative, but when the bar gets crowded it might be hard getting a drink.

Ambiance:
It's a really small shop with a few high top tables. Good if you are going in as small group.

Food:
Haven't gotten a chance to try the food yet, but they have a pretty good selection of beers and specials."}
{"text":"I almost reviewed this place the first week it was open, and I'm glad I waited. This candlelit snack bar with drink specials is really coming into its own. 

This corner isn't necessarily known for its drink specials, so when I can get a shot and a pint for $9 without leaving my hood, I'm a happy little lady. 

I look forward to returning (when I'm not out on a strictly-liquid evening) to this tiny stop and trying their fabulous looking food."}
