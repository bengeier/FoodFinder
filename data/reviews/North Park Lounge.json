{"text":"I only gave this four stars because yelp + business owners remove all low ratings and i felt my experience should be published.  I'd love to provide a review of the food here, but unfortunately I can't because we never had a server come to our table.  The hostess seated us and gave us menus, and that's the last interaction we had with any employee in the 15+ minutes we sat there.  For the first several minutes we though maybe its because they were busy.  But as time went on and we were passed by numerous servers, we started to wonder if we were invisible.  For the next several minutes we amused ourselves wondering how long it would take a server to eventually come to our table, and we spent the last five minutes discussing where we were going for dinner after we left North Park Lounge.  No, we weren't in a remote corner.  We were front and center at a table that every server had to walk past to pick up their orders.  Our table was right beside the hostess station where two of them were working.  Sure, we could have gone to them and asked for a server, but that's not our job.  Besides, after waiting so long our appetite for this place had soured.  There are enough restaurants around that we don't need to help ourselves.  The purpose of a restaurant is to serve food to their customers, and this place failed us.  I have a one strike rule with restaurants.  As I said, there are plenty of restaurants, and we will opt for other places in the future rather than risk another poor experience here."}
{"text":"Awesome is the best way to describe North Park Lounge. My son came home on leave and surprised his girlfriend and her family during dinner. The staff worked with us to pull off the surprise. They were very accommodating. After we were done with dinner and asked for our bill (there were 7 of us) our waitress said a few of the girls got together and took care of our whole bill!  Words can't express how grateful we are to the staff to make my son's homecoming special. The staff was wonderful and food was fantastic!  I highly recommend North Park Lounge."}
{"text":"Best wings in the 'burgh!  Great bar food and decent prices.  Service is usually good too."}
{"text":"It was crowded as expected on a Friday night.  We were seated in a booth with a huge tear in the seat.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar/restaurant, but was hoping for a better meal. We ordered the fried zucchini  appetizer and was very disappointed when the plate arrived with 4 tiny strips.  The rest of our food came quickly and was just ok.  Probably won't return because of the disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I used to come here occasionally and like the wings and the sandwiches. The last three times have been progressively worse over the last year. The pasta overcooked, the sauce thick and tasteless, the salad rife with old refrigerator - you know what I mean, the wings and fish and french fries as if they came straight from the SYSCO truck and then to the freezer then to the fryer. If you don't know what I mean then by all means keep eating here. Clearly the food does not deter the masses who pack this place and Olive Garden etc. I'm sure the bar is a good time. It is too bad that even a local small chain has let the food go like this. I imagine they are resting on their reputation. The service is friendly and the outside patio is nice but I will not return because of the food."}
{"text":"NPL seems to be going downhill. Horrible service from the hostesses, waited 45 minutes for a table we called ahead for and was told upon arrival it would only be a 30 minute wait. Hostesses were rude and lacked any welcoming presence, they seated a larger party that came in after us with no real excuse. The waitress was wonderful but the food was lackluster...burned chicken parm and uncooked baked potatoes left the entire table disappointed. Manager took the chicken parm off the bill but offered no real apology or explaination. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Never ate here before and I'm always up for trying new places   We were greeted immediately and promptly seated.   I went with with a group of 3 adults, 2 teenagers and a child  Our drink order was also quickly taken.   We started off with lounge fries and fried cheese The lounge fries were a meal in themselves and super delicious. The fries cheese was also very good.  Between us we ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, 2 taco salads, child's pizza, pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and an order of chicken tenders.   Everything was delicious. They accidentally made my chicken wrap plain grilled without buffalo sauce...but I'm not one to fuss even though the waitress offered to fix it for me. I just had her bring me a side of buffalo sauce and all was well.  The taco salads are huge and come in a tortilla she'll as the bowl.  After we ate the youngins took off to the arcade where they played games and won tickets to exchange for prizes.  We were there for about 2 hours and most of that time was hanging out and waiting on the kids as it was not a busy time.   Our waitress was fantastic and on top of keeping our drinks filled and checking in on us.   I would recommend this place to anyone and will go back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for seating.  Hostess kept calling wrong number.  Not worth the wait for regular bar food.  Not the best bar selection."}
{"text":"North Park Lounge is a great place to meet friends for Happy Hour drafts and fish sandwiches on Friday after work. The best bar food around the North Hills and a friendly atmosphere make North Park Lounge a place you want to hang out with your friends and relax.   In addition to the fish sandwiches, the barbeque chicken dip is always a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. When this place first opened I thought it was a godsend. As the years pass I can only see negatives each time I'm sitting at the bar that resembles a fraternity party, or watching hardworking wait staff being harassed by incompetent \"managers.\" It's basically a mediocre sports bar with a lackluster menu and warm draft beers. Not to mention the outrageously priced drinks. They have a target audience of Murrysville socialites with deep pockets. Sadly, that seemingly unattainable desire to become a 5-star destination restaurant is only causing an unhealthy and stuffy workplace. I wish the wait staff all the best with some of those mangers basically harassing them for their own enjoyment. Needs some major adjustments, especially with Bella Luna right down there steet."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other night because BJ's was too busy.  It's drab and the food is just okay.  I don't care how busy anything else is, I don't see myself coming back.  Maybe when I'm 90, actually, because that seems to be their primary demographic."}
{"text":"Went to NPL with a large party of over 50 people. We had two severs who for the whole group and never once felt forgotten or didn't get food/check/refills in a timely manner. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Love that they have different food deals each day of the week. We went on a Monday and got the the pasta deal. For $10.99 I got a salad, three garlic rolls, huge pasta dish (chicken and tortellini alfredo), a drink, and a dessert. Food was pretty good- definitely enough to make another meal or two the next day- and the boston creme pie I had for dessert was awesome! Daily deals are definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I love this place for pizza and sandwiches. I love the turkey, ham,swiss on a pretzel bun. They have a delicious Reuben too! I have had the fish dinner that was good too. Several times I have had Mickey as my waitress when I sat inside but the past several times she has been in the outside bar. She is the absolute BEST!!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price and the service is always on point. Have gone for girls nights, family dinners, and just meeting a friend for lunch. Lots of seating options, love being on the porch! They started building an outside bar last year but it never progressed. Hope they finish and open it, would be a great addition!"}
{"text":"The family wanted to meet at NPL for dinner on a Friday early evening... kept checking the No Wait App and if indicated no delay ... \"Come on Down\" it said constantly.  Upon arrival we were told there was a 40 minute wait!?!?! I opened the App and showed the hostess that it still showed   No Wait.  Her reply was ... oh ... duh ... and offered no excuse or apology whatsoever.  Ended up at a nearby competitor and have a great meal with cheerful and courteous waitstaff.    If they indicate participation in the seating App, they should take the time to actually update it accordingly and not treat their customers with such indifference.  If I could give Zero Stars I would ..."}
{"text":"Went there on a double date. Nice neighborhood bar and grill. Food was mediocre - not special about it. Garlic rolls were fantastic. My wife got a ruben which was standard, kinda dried out though. They have free popcorn which comes is different. I got the meatloaf which was good but obviously not healthy at all. Overall, we will probably go back in the future."}
{"text":"Great blue collar, Pittsburgh atmosphere...cozy & warm. The wife and I both had salads that were fresh and flavorful. I had the buffalo chix salad and she had the strawberry chix salad. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and our waitress was really trained well. The food was super salty...leaving me feeling ill after the appetizer and unable to even eat my meal.  My husband agreed about the salt and didn't even take his leftovers home. I do not think we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere!   However, very disappointed there is no smoking section.   I had to go outside to smoke a cigarette!  Not fair."}
{"text":"The lounge fries... are the BEST!  And for those of you who love ranch, this is by far the best ranch I've ever had.  NPL is a great Pittsburgh feeling stop, with tons of locals and great service.  Tons of TVs so you can always catch a current game, and they even added small TV screens to the booth tables.  The owner is very personable and you can see him checking in with tables on a regular basis.  Definitely a recommended stop if you are in the area but are not familiar with NPL."}
{"text":"Where's Joanie? You fired the most experienced professional in the place?  Went for dinner and most servers were young and inexperienced.  Service was slow and the employees were observed gossiping and socializing rather than checking my beverage levels.  It felt like a college bar more than a local place where adults dine. What were you thinking North Park Lounge??!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the original NPL, and this obe had the same great food plus a ton of room including a massive outdoor bar. You really can't go wrong with ordering here. Personal favorites are the cajun pasta and catholic knots, and the Lounge Fries. Be prepared to share."}
{"text":"Not worth the trouble. Tough to park, an hour to be seated for bar food. Have been to the original,  take my advice and drive there. Same food, better atmosphere,  and service. Definitely will not be back. I'drather go the gateway grill. Better service and food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for dinner with my parents since I was a kid.  If I were to rate my first 30+ trips here I would give this place 5 stars, no questions asked.  The service is always great, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious.  However, if I were to rate my most recent experience here I'd have to give it only 1 star. (Leading to my overall rating of 3 stars). I absolutely recommend coming out to the lounge for dinner, but if you're looking for a reasonable breakfast spot I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  I recently visited the lounge for one of their lesser-advertised events: their Sunday morning brunch buffet.  From the moment I stepped in the front door I felt like this may have been a mistake.  The hostess looked at me and my guest and, rather than delivering a pleasant \"Good morning, are you here for brunch?\", she said to us \"You do know this is a buffet, right?\". (Is this a \"fat joke\"? What a nice way to greet your guests).  From here, the visit only got worse.  Rather than offering us a seat near the food or even in a reasonably located area in the nearly empty restaurant, the hostess took us to a booth in the back corner, DIRECTLY next to a table of people whose chairs were blocking the entrance of our booth. (We literally had to ask them to move their chairs in every time we got up from our table).    The food happened to be the best part of the visit - unfortunately, it was only on par with an average college dining hall (read: burnt bacon, cold biscuits and gravy, rotting fruit).  Additionally, since they don't offer a menu or even mention a price online or in the restaurant, please know going in that this will cost you $11.99 per adult (as of today, price likely to rise), not including drinks.  And if you do get a drink, this will cost you just shy of $3 for a 12 oz glass of milk, juice, or other standard breakfast drink.    Another heads up since there are no prices listed (no menu) and your waitress will not tell you - refills are not free or even discounted.  In fact, I wound up spending nearly as much on drinks (non-alcoholic - I had milk and my guest had OJ) for my guest and me as I did on the food.  I understand that a restaurant has to make money, but I do believe they should have prices posted so you know what to expect when the bill comes.  To recap: If you're looking for a reasonably priced local restaurant that provides quality service and a nice meal at dinner time I absolutely recommend coming to NPL on Babcock.  However, if you're looking for a reasonably priced local restaurant that provides quality service and a nice buffet at breakfast time I sincerely recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great new Murrysville restaurant with an excellent beer selection and a nice variety of salads, sandwiches, pizza, and hot entrees. They will soon have an awesome covered outdoor bar/eating area as well as a separate fire pit sitting area.  We started with the zucchini plank appetizer, which was good. We had the pulled pork sandwich and Cuban sandwich on a pretzel roll. Both were unique and outstanding. Great chips and sweet potato fries.  Even though they've only been open a few weeks, it seems that they've gotten their systems working smoothly and their servers well-trained. We visited on a busy Friday evening and we had excellent service; our appetizer and meals arrived quickly and completely. Our server checked on us several times during dinner. I spoke with two managers who appeared to have experience and who had a good handle on what was going on."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar/restaurant with plenty of comfortable seating.  The servers are good and so is the food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Try the fish sandwich (it's gigantic!).  Moderately priced.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Can't come here without having the lounge fries. Great for watching games because they have tvs everywhere and now they even have them in booths. Great happy hour specials if you sit at the bar. Overall a great place to go to if you like beer and sports."}
{"text":"NPL is very close to home and I have come here with my family for a quick dinner or to meet the girls for a drink and some appetizers. The food is typical bar food, fair to middlin' in taste and quality. The service has gotten worse and worse and today had to be the worst of the worst. We waited for over 5 minutes to place our order although we expressed that we were ready when we sat down. The sliders were overcooked and the buns were burnt. The soup we ordered was runny, oily and although it was wedding soup, it only had three pebble sized meatballs. To top off the visit, the server placed dirty dishes from another table on our table when we were getting ready to leave. Having been a server and bartender in the past, I would NEVER think to leave dirty dishes on a table, especially dishes from another table. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Great crowd for happy hour, excellent service! And a very upbeat fun atmosphere I definitely recommend and my wife and I went on a Tuesday can only imagine how much fun on a Friday!"}
{"text":"Just visiting area staying in a nearby motel. Drove by and saw a parking lot full of cars so decided to give it a try for a casual dinner. Both wife and I picked the \"small\" fried cod fish sandwich. It was great. A thick piece of flakey cod fried to perfection. So big it stuck outside the big bun about 1inch on both sides. I can't imagine the size of the large sandwich. Actually, my wife and I could have split one sandwich and been satisfied.   Sandwich came with an over abundance of French fries and a tasty dish of Cole slaw. Service was most friendly and meal was served most promptly. We would both order the fish sandwich again at the NPL. There were many other interesting options. Place was very busy and TV's filled the walls. Will return when in town."}
{"text":"We went for dinner in New Years Eve & it was an impromptu visit. We were headed to Moe's for a quick bite & didn't realize they closed early.  North Park was busy but still had room for two.  Wait staff was very friendly & food quality was very well for the price. The New Year's dinner special was right on for pricing & options.  My boyfriend was expecting a sirloin steak & he was served what appeared to be a flat iron in visual view & texture.   It was still good but not what he thought was on the menu.  4 stars for that reason otherwise I would've given 5"}
{"text":"Pretend you own a bar/restaurant. A pitbull look-alike wearing a polo visor, accompanied by a party of ~50, begins spitting on the floor repeatedly, screaming high pitched 'woooo's in customers faces, and approaches tables and threatens to slam them against the wall, enters your bar. How long would it take for you to cut this patron off and send him home? It took north park lounge about 3 hours."}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the last 20 years.  The place has gotten to be dirty, less friendly and most of all it doesn't have very good food.  Me and my family visited the restaurant on September 5.  We were greeted by two younger girls that were accommodating when we asked to be switched from one seating area to another.  Things stated off ok.    We ordered all of our meals (5) and asked for the \"lounge fries\" as our appetizer.  The came fairly quickly and looked good, but once we ate a few we all noticed a stinky dish rag smell to the fries.  They also had a nasty taste to them.  Then we get our meals and two of us ordered the grilled chicken wrap with mild wing sauce on the side.   The wing sauce was just so bad; it was literally a droplet of Franks Hot Sauce and the rest was grease!!!  We asked the manager about it and he said that was exactly what it is and that is the way they make their mild wing sauce!  We have made a decision not to visit this place any more based on our last 5 visits it so."}
{"text":"The NPL is a \"Cheers\"  type of bar/restaurant. A lot of the patrons appear to be regulars, judging by how often I hear a waitress greet a party with a Pittsburghese \"How ya doin', hon?\" They have an extensive menu with many of the expected items such as a giant fish sandwich (and I mean GIANT), hoagies and burgers, as well as a good number of full entrees featuring chicken, steak and pasta.   The walls are decorated with large pictures of golden age movie stars and Pittsburgh sports themed items.  They also serve some things you don't see everywhere else, like a sandwich with ham, fried egg, tomato and french fries. Decent beer selection. Daily dinner specials.   I'm a fan of the giant fish sandwich, the cajun pasta and the italian hoagie.  They have added an outdoor dining area to their already large seating area. Don't be apprehensive when you see a crowded parking lot - they can accommodate a lot of diners. But Friday and Saturday nights will probably mean a wait at peak dinner hours.   The service is always friendly and prompt. Prices are on the low side of the moderate range for meals.  Review based on about a dozen visits."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this choice.  A huge menu and bar area will satisfy even the most picky eaters in your party.   I have never had a bad thing to eat here.  They also have a great selection of wings and draft beers at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The lounge fries. Oh god, god yes. That's all you need to order, and that's all you need to know.  Oh, and the beer and the people are also both great."}
{"text":"Greaseball Supreme  North Park Lounge apparently specializes in super greasy food I had the misfortune of eating there recently. I like to eat relatively healthy - I am far from obsessive about it. But NPL offers nothing but unhealthy fare unless you just want a simple salad I ordered a fish sandwich with no bun and a side of broccoli raab instead of fries. Even after removing the breadibg the fish was still greasy and not very fresh and the broccoli was soaked in oil. I called the manager and he seemed to be confused but offered me a coupon. But why would I want more nasty food? If you want unhealthy greasy food and fishy fish then this is your place."}
{"text":"Service is always prompt. Beer selection is pretty good. Food is above average for a sports bar. The pretzel appetizer is huge, and taste great. Burgers are good. This is a great place to go for groups, or to catch a game on tv."}
{"text":"Lounge fries, lounge fries and more lounge fries! This place keeps me coming back. Step up from basic bar food, always have a drink special and they have little tv's at the booths to watch games. I started coming here more and more now that rumrunners is steaming pile of poo and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years.  We never have a bad meal.  The fried zucchini is great.  The garlic rolls are to die for.  The salads are really good.  My husband likes the pot roast and meatloaf."}
{"text":"5 stars!  I really liked this place when we decided to stop here for a late lunch.   We were seated immediately in the small bar section.  The woman tending bar gave us our menus and adequate time to decide on on our choices.  Weekly lunch and dinner specials are offered and the prices are very reasonable.  For an appetizer, we tried the stuffed pretzel. It was delicious. I got the 1/2 sub and 5 wings combo, while husband picked one of his favorite sandwiches, the Reuben.  Everything was perfect.   This is only the second time I have been here.  The first time was in the evening when the bar was quite crowded. Even then, we had great service and food.   When the weather turns warmer, it will be nice to see what the patio section is like."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but can be a bit expensive compared to some other places for certain dishes. Their drinks are also pretty pricey and I had a special mixed drink that they had... It was awful. But my friend got a different mixed drink that was blue(some drink that was a seasonal special) and it was ok. The atmosphere is very nice, I love the patio... Even when it's cold because of the fire. They also have a birthday wheel, so that is a fun bonus for a celebration! I would suggest the NPL!"}
{"text":"A decent local place to get some food. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of beers they had, both on tap and draft. There was a pretty good crowd for a Saturday night too. The outdoor porch was covered and heated, which was actually very nice to sit in despite how cold it was outside. The food was very good! A giant pretzel for an appetizer was delicious, and my salmon was perfectly cooked. Good atmosphere, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"NPL is a great restaurant and I go there weekly.  The good: - Tons of appetizer choices for sports bar food. Wings, Pretzels, Big fries with cheese/bacon, nachos that are good but will make you poop green, onion rings and other things. - I love their burgers. My mom hates them but I really enjoy them. - I don't eat much fish but everyone loves their big fish sandwich. - You will have something to take home, especially if you have an appetizer. - The walking manager is really a great guy. He is the heart of NPL.  The bad: - The bus boys are like hawks preying on little birds when there are empty plates or glasses around. They watch and wait and glance at you multiple times, begging you to finish. It gets annoying. - They have TV's at all the booths, however, the TV's have maybe 6-7 channels. 1 is some kind of poker game, 1 always has no audio and if there is a Pittsburgh sports game on, it will be on multiple channels, meaning you get maybe 3 different channels to choose from.  - They have new booths and there is one by the door that is only meant for people under 150lbs. It was the first booth I couldn't fit in ever in my life.  TIPS: - They take a long time to make burgers and other meats. - They \"stagger\" food and appetizers. This means that after you order an appetizer, they will wait however long they feel to put in the order. Tell them not to \"stagger it\" and you will be out of there A LOT quicker."}
{"text":"Food was very good, decent prices but I felt like I was bothering the waitress with wanting food containers, refills and she wasn't very friendly. I usually tip 25 percent. I didn't this time."}
{"text":"After looking at reviews, my wife and I decided to try NPL on a Friday night.  Like most restaurants on Friday, either show up early or be prepared to wait.  Even though it was a cold night, we were sat on the patio.  It was nice because they had a fire place and heaters and the patio is less crowded and cramped than the seats inside.    The wait staff was ok, but i was not overly impressed.  It is tough to judge on only one visit, but I don't like to have an empty drink cup for as long as we had.  The food was above average bar food.  We ended up ordering the Lounge fries and the giant fish sandwich with a side of onion rings.  The cheese sauce on the fries was delicious and much better than the neon orange cheese sauce you get at a lot of other places.  The fish was cod and was pretty good but a little greasy.  Overall, we did not leave hungry and I would order everything we did again."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Specials from 5-7 on bar food.  Plenty of TV's, and Buzztime NTN Network to play trivia.  Staff is friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Terrible. Turned off jukebox at 6 on a Saturday night. The manager was very inconsiderate of our financial loss. They let parents get hammered in front of their kids but do not allow any uptempo music. Priorities. Food was mediocre and the bar was very boring. Would never come here or recommend to any friends or family. Seems like a silver sneakers club."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner at NPL on a Thursday evening, and it was unbelievably packed! Little did we know that their special was \"Taco Thursday\" with additional Mexican dishes on the menu. Also, there was as Steelers preseason game on that will help draw a crowd.   To my surprise, we did not have to wait to be seated. The walkways between tables are very narrow and make it  difficult to pass guests/employees if you must pass them by. I like the variety of food that NPL has to offer. Anything from sandwiches, salads, and burgers, to pasta dishes, pizza, and wings. With so many options, it was hard to decide! We settled on the cheese stuffed pretzel for an appetizer - now, I expected this item to be a soft pretzel filled with cheese. Nope! It was one of the pretzel rolls that they use for the sandwiches with slices of cheese melted in between. I was not impressed, however, it tasted ok especially when dipped in honey mustard. For my dinner, I ordered the 6\" hot Italian sandwich  with a side of sweet potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised! The sandwich was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed the fries although they didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce (and I wasn't going to dip them in ketchup) which was a slight disappointment. My meal was very filling and I was able to take half of the sandwich home to have at a later date.   I'll give props to this place for the atmosphere they have developed: a popcorn machine filled to the top with freshly made buttered popcorn, a spinning wheel for entertainment, and TV's everywhere to watch any game. Of course, they have an extensive list of beverages for you to enjoy as well. A screened in porch provides an opportunity to sit outside when the weather is nice.  Every staff member we encountered was very attentive and nice.   Overall, my experience was satisfying. Decent food, reasonably priced, friendly staff, and a lot events/specials going on at all times. We will probably be back for some football this fall."}
{"text":"Always good food, can be crowded so expect a wait at times. Service can be lacking at times but that doesn't keep us away. Like the food, the stuffed pretzels are delicious and most of the sandwiches and salads are good. Can't go wrong visiting here"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight during Happy Hour for drinks and dinner.   They have a large drink menu - anything from Moscow miles to wines to cocktails. I ordered the White Sangria. It was super fruity, just like I like it! My friend and I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip to start. It's large and comes with great pita bread. I've eaten a lot of spinach dips and this one is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it if you are a dip person. It's very large easily serving 3 people.   For dinner I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad. It's comes with blue cheese, but I asked for it to be removed. Be aware the salad has a lot of mozzarella cheese on it! Over all it was very good. Nothing extremely special. The portion size for the salad was also very large and worth every cent.   This is a great place to stop if you are traveling through Murrysville to or from Pittsburgh. They have a Private parking lot near several other shops."}
{"text":"NIce and clean setting. Great service and good food. Server was very responsive about allergy concerns, specials requests etc.  Chicken salad had fab ranch dressing and chicken was tender and flavorful. Could have more tho and more than just iceberg lettuce. Friend got chicken tenders and got the equivalent of 2 whole breasts."}
{"text":"Overcrowded with seniors during week for lunch, so noisy!! My waitress should have retired 20 years ago, slow as moses, and had an attitude!! The pulled pork sandwich had zero BBQ sauce, no taste with some foreign Cole Slaw. High price, bad food, bad service. Hire some younge girls, geez its summer!!! Hire more cooks who can actually make what is on your menu!"}
{"text":"We hit North Park for lunch and it was OK.. The menu is bar food with nothing outstanding. The burger that I had was not exceptional but OK. All in all if your in the area and you have this as an option, you won't loose."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout the other night and everything was prepared on time and exactly how we asked for. They were incredibly busy, however the bar tender was very friendly when I went in to pick up my order."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere. I never knew this was here! I really loved the patio. Very large bar with an adequate number of bartenders. We had pretty good service for how many people were on the patio and at the bar. My entree was a normal nothing jump out at you steak salad and I had a strawberry Moscow Mule that was pretty good. I'll will definitely try this place again. The person next to me had a pizza that looked amazing.  Yes, I'm looking at future food while currently eating."}
{"text":"Food and service has always been very good. Frequent here at least once every two weeks since it opened. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"If you want to watch a sporting event this is the place to come.!! The fish tacos are one of the best in the area! I highly recommend bar seating for the best service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I. Love. NPL. This is such a staple for my friends and I. Great drinks and great food. I must say, I always get the same thing when I come here, but I can't help it because it's so good- French onion soup and steak salad. Their French onion soup is some of the best I've ever had. It's always super cheesy and extremely tasty. The steak salad is an awesome portion. Definitely very filling and it's real strip steak, not just a lame cut of beef. I also really enjoy their drink selection. They seem to always have seasonal drinks, such as pumpkin cider or a caramel apple milkshake for Fall. They also have different deals on different days, such as burger days on Wednesday which you get a burger, fries and milkshake for $10. Great place, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go to get your drink or grub on...  We went on a Sunday afternoon and had lunch.  I ordered the Colossal Fish w onion rings, my son ordered the Chicken Flatbread, other son ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and my wive ordered the Cuban.  The fish could feed 2 people, the flatbread was delicious and the quesadilla was gone before I had a chance for a bite.  The Cuban was the only problem.  It came out w a full plate of fries but the sandwich was very 'wet'. Not sure if it was butter or what from putting it on the griddle but even after sipping it up w a napkin- it wasn't very appealing.  The inside filling looked great but the wet bread kinda ruined it.  Watching all the other delicious foods coming out of the Kitchen ensured we'll be back and I'll be the one to select my wife's meal."}
{"text":"Good food and the prices are fare. However, the service is inconsistent and if you are handicapped forget this place. I can't figure out how a public place that was remodeled 2 years ago can avoid handicap access .....  Shame on McCandless township and the owners of this establishment for your bathrooms."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for their burgers. They are the best I've had here in Pittsburgh. Their meat is so tasty, wished I knew their secret. We have gone to this location as well as the one out past Ross Park mall and the service has always been real friendly and attentive. Especially when we have come with our two small children."}
{"text":"This place always has great meals!! Appetizers to lunch or dinner!! You can watch a sports game and hang out with good people.. when I lived by here in the late 90s I  used to go more than 2-3 times a week. Whenever I'm in the North hills it's a must visit. The staff is AWESOME! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Not sure we would try it again. We arrived at 6:20 and were seated by 7. The bar was packed - so we just stood inside the front door to wait it out. it would have been great to have some wait seating - but that's not the worst part. We ordered 2 burgers (glad we could order rare and med rare) & the large beer battered fish sandwich.   Both burgers arrived WELL done with cold (yet somehow very well done) fries - the fish was not as described. It was a thin crumb coated slice of fish. My husband cut it in half and stacked it on the bun - not LARGE, not BEER battered. His fries were also cold - and the small plastic cup of slaw was spoiled. it was not cold - so guessing it had been sitting out for some time.   The service was slow - 40 min to get the food after we ordered. We did let the waitress know about the burgers and fries and she did offer to have the burgers recorded - but we declined - honestly too hungry to wait another 40 min. We did ask for hot fries. A manager brought us over fresh hot fries by the time we finished the burgers - and that was appreciated - as they were very fresh (and seasoned MUCH differently) than the simply salted fries on our dinner plate.   Our water glasses were all empty - and the waitress (who only offered to get a second round of beers when she brought the food) did not offer water refills.   The manager did take 50% off of our bill - which we were grateful for - and did not ask for - but we would have been happy to pay the full price and just get our food cooked as we ordered - look as it is described in the menu with hot fries. Here is the thing about the burgers - if the kitchen staff does not know how to cook anything but well done - just do not offer cooked to order. lf you can not find the 12 oz beer battered cod to prepare - just let the customer know when the item is ordered.   it's too bad - because Murrysville really could use a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Wheat beer an more wheat beer. Taps are terrible. It's either wheat beer or an IPA that's it.After all this they let a bunch of drunks in and served them. They didn't control the situation awful experience. I had to confront the unruly gang an was thanked by the other patrons for putting the drunks in check. Drunk golfers that get to much sun."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check out the restaurant.  We came in on a Monday night after the evening rush.  The two hostesses greeted us as we came in.  One asked if we wanted to eat inside or out.  Since I just got done installing a new air conditioner at my mother-in-law's house I wanted inside.  She took us to a table.  There was an open booth but a table worked.  We sat and checked out the drink specials in the menu, we watched the screens and the beer menu cycled around.  Since no one came to take our drink order we looked over the menu.  We talked about what we wanted.  In the same time the booth was filled.  Drink order taken and received.  We after 7 minutes decided they did not want out money and left.  --- interesting we saw at least 7 or 8 servers plus a few others and no service.  It was very appropriate that we saw an advertisement for a front end manager cycle through the tv screen for the Murrysville location.  It was obvious that the manager was missing on Monday night."}
{"text":"We order to go from here all the time. The burgers are really good to go and so are the fries. The one word of wisdom I have is, do not order lounge fries to go. They lose their magic and appeal."}
{"text":"Excellent menu. Good Food. Great daily specials. I enjoy the different combo meals and the great Garlic rolls. A definite must try."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years and really enjoy the huge variety. Everything we have ever had has been great and cooked perfectly.  We placed a large catering order for today and I just wanted to say how wonderful everything was!! We ordered 400 wings, cheese fries and stuffed mushrooms. Everything was delicious, hot, and packaged perfectly.  We were given a lot of ranch dressing and carrots and celery too. It was so nice to have a party and not worry about the food at all. I will use NPL next time we host an event like this and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a large carry out order."}
{"text":"I had an appointment yesterday afternoon, so hubby and I went to North Park Lounge for a late lunch. If you are looking for something fast and not special it is the place to go! The staff isn't the greatest (not very friendly). I would be more inclined to go when there is a game on all the TVs, and for drinks not food."}
{"text":"I really like it here! Let me just say...the garlic rolls are A M A Z I N G!! We were a group of 10 and all got different things. Our server was amazing with getting everything right (we are a little difficult with substitutions or eliminations). She was even able to split the check 3 ways which doesn't always happen with larger groups. Let's see we got, salads, wings, pizza, sandwiches, garlic rolls, did I mention garlic rolls, oh, the garlic rolls!! One person in our group got the large pretzel. OK, large; perhaps a bit bigger than your hand. Nope, guess again, it was the size of a pizza tray!  We did have a lot of leftovers as the portions are bigger than one person can eat. But, that just helped to keep the party going the next day! We will all be back!"}
{"text":"We just recently visited this location for the first time. We had a larger group and they were very accommodating. The food and service were both excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is so goo here!!  The service, wonderful!!  Love the outside patio!  The Patio should be open year round.  Looking forwards omitting out there in the snow!  Order the jumbo wings or the burgers. Both are exceptional!"}
{"text":"When you arrive at 12:30pm and the buffet ends at 1pm, you don't expect much. Wow, did North Park over deliver! Our group of 5 all took advantage of the extensive buffet. My plate included tots, a blintz, pancakes, a freshly made waffle+toppings, mac 'n cheese, an MTO omelette and who knows what else? Throw in a chocolate fountain, multiple dessert options, amazing service and a $14 bill and you've got a fan.for.LIFE!"}
{"text":"This place is listed twice, so both listings get my review since it is a duplicate listing...  I have been to North Park Lounge a few times now, and this past time was the first time I ordered food.  First the good, and actually the great thing about NPL is the outdoor bar area, something Murrysville bars/restaurants don't have.    It is large, on a big deck covered, but open, with a ton of seating and a big bar equipped with several televisions for your viewing pleasure.  They also have a fine selection of drafts, and next year plan to open a cabana bar, which could prove to be pretty awesome.  So now the not so good.  Last time I stopped there was late on a Thursday night.  I was starving, running around all day, and literally had no food in me, so my mood was hangry.  Being hangry I swear I probably could've eaten about anything and thought it was good or better.  No so much this night.  When we got there we went to the outdoor bar.  As we were sitting down on the stools a bartender stood in front of us.  Both hands spread out on the bar as he leaned in at us and stared us down.  I looked up, said \"hello.\"  He does return the gesture but the stance was awkward and unwelcoming.  He asked what we wanted to drink.  Never asked if we were eating, so I said \"you're still serving food right?\"  He said yea and went to fetch menus.  I ordered a beer while I perused the menu.  Okay this menu is ridiculous.  It has to be 8-10 pages.  Way too much.  Also with all kinds of food options like pizza, wings, taco's, hamburgers, sandwiches, pasta's, ribs, fish dinners and many more.  The point being is the menu is so vast there is that great feeling that nothing can really be done great, or fresh cause there is just too much.    I decided on a Reuben sandwich with my thought process being, who can screw that up?  I'm starving and Reuben's are usually big, and it's an all around comforting food when you are dealing with a case of the hangrys.  My husband got a pulled pork sandwich.  Mine came with regular fries, his sweet potato.  So we waited for our food.  The servers all seemed to be a little immature.   They would gather and talk not really walking around cleaning up things or making sure people were taken care of.  So out comes our food.  First impression.  Damn this is a small Reuben... I mean pretty damn small...   The meat was skimped, as was the thin bread, and the toppings.  Next the fries.   Bloody awful, stone cold and hard.  They were clearly made a while back in large batches and thrown on my plate with my sandwich.  I couldn't finish one of them.  They didn't even attempt to warm them just bring them out cold.  This became obnoxiously obvious when I tasted one of his sweet potato fries, which were not only warm but crispy.  Yep, it's safe to say they make at least one kind of fry to order.  Moving on my small sandwich was not pleasing.  I was so hungry I swear I could have eaten a boiled flip flop.  This sandwich had a very funny metallic taste to it.  I ate it, mostly because I was so hungry, but it really wasn't good.  I took the last few bites and tried to dissect where the weird taste was coming from.  I tried the meat alone and it seemed okay, but when I got to the sauerkraut and the sauce I could detect the rancid taste stronger.  I didn't finish that last bite, and the bartender took my plate away without asking how it was or even commenting on why I didn't touch the fries.  My husband's sandwich was also a fail, the pork, was dry yet greasy, and they bottom part of the bun disintegrated when he picked it up for the first time since it was saturated in grease.    I will come back here to drink, since their outdoor facility is so nice, but I highly doubt I will ever eat here again.  If they can screw up the simple things, I can't imagine something more complex in there overstuffed menu."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years. The food was plentiful and well prepared and the service was great."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner/ happy hour. Ordered a salad and some beer and my husband ordered wings and some drinks. I called before we came to ask about specials and I believe it was Josh who answered the phone and was extremely helpful. We sat at a table in the bar area and it was the perfect time to go, since we seemed to beat the Friday evening rush. They have a great outdoor open bar area with some decent beer specials. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating. One down side is that wings only come in 5 or 10, not 6 or 12. All Memorial Day weekend they served about 8 types of bottled beers for $1.50 each. It's a great place to be in the summer for games, drinks, or just the atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Food was great everything was so fresh. Fish tacos are a must and a do over!!  Turkey bacon on pretzel bun sounds simple but wow the bacon and that bun!  Keep up the good work. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"We had a very large softball group of 30 plus.  Our waiter Joshua handled us ALL on his own!!  We never had an empty glass or waited for nothing!!  This guy busted his butt!!!  They better recognize this guy and keep him around!!    Food prepped were amazing as well!  Everything came out together and in a timely fashion!!  When does a group of 30 all get their food together!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was just as good. Actually took a chance on the chicken parmesan (wasn't in mood for burger or sandwich) and was much better than I expected at a bar restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"North Park Lounge is close to home for us, so its always a good option for a dinner out when we dont want to drive outside the neighborhood.   At this North Hills location there is often a fairly long wait on weekends, but of course you can grab a drink from the bar while you wait -which makes the wait not so bad. I have never had unfriendly or bad service here and the food is always solid, although it is also fairly average. However, I have never had anything come out cold or not the way I wanted it. Their french onion soup is AMAZING and the lounge fried and burgers are really good - juicy, hot and never dry. They are always a winner.   Other menu items like their salads and other non-burger sandwiches are just OK and slightly underwhelming...Ive had the grilled chicken salad with the fries and the buffalo chicken salad- they are just average for me - Its usually just a lot of lettuce with few toppings (chicken included) - I like a lot of \"stuff\" in my salads and if I am eating a large dinner salad out, I want it to have a good lettuce to \"stuff\" ratio, which these often don't. But this is just a personal preference.   I'm not from the North Hills, nor am I from Pittsburgh originally. I find that those who grew up in the area are pretty loyal to this place and it almost has a cult-like following for them. As an outsider, its just a pretty average neighborhood place to get a burger and a beer. Still wont stop us from heading back for dinner in the area, or if the mood strikes for a crock of french onion soup close to home."}
{"text":"Came here with family for lunch last week. We had a party of 6 and a toddler and they accommodated everyone well. Our server was friendly and attentive -my water glass was never empty, which I always appreciate. I am giving this review 4 stars as our waitress was very good.   We started with the large fried pretzel and dipping sauces. The pretzel itself was good, albeit a bit oily and the sauces were also good. The honey mustard and ranch were tasty but the cheese dip was nearly flavorless and a little too orange for my liking.   I went with the buffalo chicken salad for my entree. This is my second and last time giving the NPL salads a go. My salad was just a huge bowl of iceberg lettuce with minimal chicken and toppings. The buffalo chicken was fried tenders just thrown in some Frank's red hot. I kind of wished it had been a more flavorful housemade sauce, but it was lacking. If I am going to eat a dinner salad out, I like it to have a solid toppings to lettuce ratio, which these never do for me. I am paying mostly for the chicken and other toppings, not the lettuce, which is unfortunately mostly what I got. It was OK, but I dont feel it was worth ordering again.   The restaurant itself was clean, well lit and really nice inside. It has a lot of large open space - there were different bars and rooms for seating, and also a patio for outdoor seating in warmer weather.   NPL at all locations is just fairly average, but consistent food. Typically isn't my first choice, but I wont put up an argument if someone I'm with suggests it. After all, there is always the french onion soup and a burger on the menu."}
{"text":"The fish sandwiches at the North Park Lounge are legendary.  The fish is huge, and it's cooked perfectly.  I never order anything else here, but then why would I need to?  It's the place to go for fish sandwiches. The service is excellent, and the fish sandwiches come to your table in just a few minutes.  I like sitting out on the patio.  They have a nice fireplace there, and it's quite cosy."}
{"text":"We discovered this place on yelp based on positive feed back and here is one more vote for this restaurant. Service was quick and friendly, positive atmosphere and delicious chicken jerky salad."}
{"text":"Came get after a futsal tournament at nearby laroche college , Saturday night prime time and they handled a party of 22 with a minimal wait. The staff was spectacular , and the food was fantastic . Huge party with burgers , salads pasta and kids meals everybody raved about the taste and the portions were spot on for this hungry crew .  Kudos to NPL.  A true  gem  on the north hills ."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch games. Booths have tv with the NFL ticket so you don't need bar space to catch the game you want to see. Wings are on the pricey side at $6.49 for 5 or $10.99 for 10, but this can be easily avoided by ordering the pizza (which is actually pretty good) and wings which comes with two decent sized one topping slices and 5 wings for $8.99.  Best homemade ranch dressing ever!  It's a really decent deal when combined with a $2.50 Coors light on NFL game day.  I also had the munchies platter for $12.99 which was probably almost enough for three people.  Is the food the best, probably not, but hey, it's a bar, they have the NFL ticket and cheap beer, so what more could I asked for beside some good old bar grub?  Looks like their sit down dinners are pretty decent too, but haven't had them yet.  Portion sizes are very favorable. Place is usually busy but it is big enough where space is not an issue. Oh, and FREE POPCORN at the Hostess stand.  Updated: I love this restaurant, why not give it five stars!  A few imperfections can't slight the fact that it is always a wonderful time."}
{"text":"We came in with a large party of 20-25 people. We didn't call the restaurant before hand to let them know that we were coming in, and they were still able to accommodate us, no problem.  I got a Coney Island root beer, and I have to say, I think I like the Coney Island brand better than Not Your Fathers. I also got an Italian hot sub, and it was perfect. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely stop by for some good eats."}
{"text":"We just went on Wednesday a little after 5pm, and it was wonderful. Before sitting down, my son decided he wanted a booth,  and the hostess was able to switch our table. Our waitress was attentive, fast, and very polite. The food came quickly. We shared a stuffed pretzel. My son had the buttered noodles. He complained about too much butter, and there was a lot pooled in the bottom of the bowl. We just put the noodles onto a plate. I ordered 5 mild wings and a chicken bacon ranch flatbread. It waa huge and delicious - took a lot of it home. Husband ordered a roadhouse burger abd substituted onion rings. The portions are large and filling, and there's leftovers to take home. My husband also got to spin the birthday wheel. We will definitely be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Went on Friday, March 24th at 6:30pm as a work dinner. We reserved a table and were able to be seated on time. Our waitress was phenomenal.  She had 2 large parties and was still fast and attentive. Our food was great and arrived quickly. Portions are huge! Our waitress checked on us and kept our drinks updated. The only downfall is that parking is HORRENDOUS and the place is extremely loud. We were in the patio section, but the windows were closed. We could barely hear each other."}
{"text":"Rude manager. My party had reserved a table for 14, but we had some newcomers, which at every other place we go is fine, but when we told the server the manager said to us \"why is it 16 all of a sudden? You told us 14 earlier, now we have to get two extra chairs\" as if it was the worst thing to say. The server ended up to be nice, and the food was aight"}
{"text":"Dining on the patio is fantastic. Great atmosphere, drinks have been consistent and tasty. I have had several entrees and liked all of them to date. Cajun chicken pasta was one of the best pasta dishes I've had! Thoroughly enjoying this new addition to Murrysville"}
{"text":"Have been to north park while in town on business couple times. Usually good but be aware that if you have an injury or handicap that prevents you from sitting on a high bar stool and wish to enjoy a happy hour pricing, this restaurant will not accommodate you. They would not give happy hour pricing because my friend could not sit in the bar on those stools. Sadly, I believe there were several ways they could have accommodated but waitress nor the manager did. Just a sorry from manager - \"it is something we'll keep in mind.\" Both were young so we'll leave it at that -- young and inexperienced. Couldn't bring myself to provide a good tip and probably won't return on my next visit."}
{"text":"We went here once with our relatives while in Pittsburgh. Such a nice place with obvious history. The menu is enormous and everything we ordered was fantastic. Probably the best service we've ever had in PGH; fast, friendly and spot on the entire meal. What a great experience, and we will go again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The North Park Lounge in Murrysville, sits off of Rt. 22, in the new Blue Spruce Plaza. We drove by the Plaza many times, but never stopped. We were only at North Park Lounge once, for lunch, on a Sunday afternoon, before a Steelers game.  The lounge was starting to gear up for the lunch time sports fans.  The lounge has a large dining area, as well as a large bar area.  There are plenty of TVs for watching any sporting event.  They built a large outdoor patio that people love to sit out and are able to watch sports from out there as well, in summer or winter. It has a great sports bar atmosphere.  I honestly can't say anything great about North Park Lounge, but can't say anything really offal about the lounge either. Our server was friendly and refilled our drinks regularly. I can't say I loved the cheeseburger. It was okay at best in my option. The serve was great, however, the food was slow in coming to the table. As a prior restaurant owner, I know the time it takes to order, prepare and serve.   I think the lounge is a great addition to Murrysville. I don't think it is on our restaurant rotation list, but I won't say, I won't return. I don't think I would come here to watch a game, unless a group of people where coming here or a special occasion. I like to watch sports in not so crowed places. This is a great place for those that enjoy that larger crowed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have not Yelped my goto spot for lunch when I am town.   I have been here atleast a dozen times, mostly lunch.  Lunch is pretty busy.  Sit outside in the bar area, it is super nice.  If you are there for a game, the TV's are at all angles, all around you.  Man, I have had so many dishes.  Pizza, wings, burger, salad with fries (it is a Pitt thing), wedding soup.  It is all terrific.   My all time favorite is the Turkey Bacon Swiss Pretzel.   So good, so perfect.  Totally awesome comfort food.  Check out their daily specials.   If you are a craft beer lover, they have an extensive local craft on draft selection.   See you there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We got here often, the place is almost always busy and service is great.  I love the meatball & salad dish but the soups are good and our kids love the milkshakes, too.  Burgers, fish tacos and flatbreads are also good - never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The North Park lounge will not blow your mind, but it's consistent and decent food.  The general vibe is a neighborhood bar feeling, similar cliental to an Applebee's.  But I'd rather service a local establishment.  There are tvs everywhere, which is slightly distracting.  I've never had great service here, but it's typically at least acceptable.  I usually order the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it still packs a punch.  Otherwise, I wouldn't get anything exotic here, but the standard menu fare is just fine.  My only complaint is you cannot really eat \"healthy\" here if you so chose.  The portions are outrageous, and everything comes with French Fries.  Would a fruit side without an up charge kill anyone?"}
{"text":"Very Popular Spot. Good menu selections.  Very friendly and perky server.  Had to send the mules back due to lack of alcohol.  The garlic bread was fantastic.  The onion soup was very good too."}
{"text":"This is becoming a weekly after work visit for us. Always such a nice staff and never  have to wait for a refill on your drink. Huge menu selection. We got the flatbread pizza and a steak salad. They were both huge in portion and delicious in taste. Worth the try!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here this past week.  I had heard good things and the experience did not disappoint.  The inside is kind of setup like a dive bar, but there are plenty of seats away from the actual bar area.    For an appetizer we had the barbecue chicken ranch dip.  I am a huge fan of buffalo chicken dip so I figured I'd give this a try.  It was delicious.  The bbq sauce had a great tangy taste.  The chips were not the best and I think flatbread or pita would go better with the dip, but I still really enjoyed it.  For my meal I had the A1 burger, which I ordered medium rare.  It came out closer to medium, but was still juicy.  It was an above average burger, but did not live up to the \"best in the burgh\" claim on their website and menu.  The meat blends just didn't seem to be a great combination, too lean a ratio possibly.  Like I said though it was juicy and had some good flavor.  The fries were your standard bar fries, they would have been just ok, but the quality ranch dressing they had made them a good side.  My wife had a chicken quesadilla which was delicious.  I definitely want to return to try some of the other things on their menu.  Great first trip though."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Plenty of big screens!  I ordered buffalo chicken with jalapeño wrap, it was good...fish came on a hamburger bun, it was good (not super huge) about 12 oz   Best thing about the npl was the atmosphere, food is decent, look forward to going and trying some other things"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the recently opened North Park Lounge in Murrysville .   This place was really jumping!  It was very busy and extremely noisy, even in the back room where there's carpeting. Lynda was our awesome waitress.  She was really sweet, attentive, and helpful in making dinner suggestions.  I had the chicken fajita flatbread without the chicken and had extra roasted peppers, onions and jalapeños. It was delicious and there was enough for 2 more meals.  My husband had Cajun Pasta with chicken and a salad with 3 garlic rolls. He said it was excellent with just the right amount of \"kick\".   Everything on the menu was tempting.   There were a lot of younger people there and I imagine the younger crowd will also very much enjoy the outside bar and cabana bar once they open in another month. I would have given a higher rating but it was a little bit too noisy for my taste. If you go for dinner, be sure to ask for Lynda as your server. She was excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food, Great service, awesome full bar, always have a great time at this place, the little bit of a wait on the weekend is worth it,, one server name Eric does a fantastic job, we recommend you sit in his section, we've always had a good meal good drinks fantastic time here,, I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The most amazing \"jerk chicken salad ' ever!!! I ate the whole thing it was sooo good, and I never thought I would since it was huge!! We'll be back...soon"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after shopping in north hills one evening.   I ordered a fish sandwich and fries. It wasn't bad. It was also filling.   My bf ordered the eggplant parmesan entree. He felt the sauce on the pasta did not taste homemade but loved the actual eggplant and meatballs. His entree was also served with garlic knots and choice of soup or salad. Great entree deal.  Not a bad option for north hills"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing!! Great bar atmosphere! But compared to the other locations they own, this one is bad!  Tables are cleaned half ass and gross. They have tv's at booths but never clean them off I barley want it near my plate let alone change to the game I want to see. Lately the staff has been very rude. Other than the bar tenders that are always wonderful. The waitress and waiter the past couple of times have been very rude to my group feeling rushed out the door. I don't want my check when I'm planning to stay and drink for the night why hire a Dj if your going to rush me out the door? Let me tell you when I'm ready. Then when things are brought to the table they have been basically tossed onto the table other than your plate of food. You have to wave them down to get a refill on your drink. The staff is in huge need of being retrained. You don't need to be a 5 star restaurant to give 5 star service."}
{"text":"We eat here several times a week.  I LOVE the salmon salad. The salmon is always cooked to perfection and it is a large piece. They are generous with the dried cranberries and candied walnuts that come with it.  It comes on a large bed of mixed greens. I also have their burgers.  They are better than Burgatory's which is in the same  plazza.  I'm not much of a drinker, but they have a great bar scene. The bar area is noisy, but we find it very lively. We love the addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"First time trying out an NPL and it was a positive experience all around. Got there around 5:30 on a Saturday night and were expecting to wait 30 minutes but we were seated right away! We sat in the front area. Bar was connected to the front area by a large doorway and there were a lot of people at the bar but the noise level of the front area was fine. Fast service despite the dinner rush. The food was very tasty. Wings, subs, fries, wraps, it was all great. We will definitely be back.  Downsides to this place are parking and if you have to wait to be seated there is not much of a waiting area."}
{"text":"NPL is a tucked-in local dive bar with a great vibe that only locals and fans know about.  Typical divey atmosphere and locals with their -not-from-round-here guests.  It's what places like Applebee's wish they were.  As for the food - the burgers are SO GOOD!  Honestly, I don't know what kind of cows they get, but these burgers are not to be trifled with.  I've eaten here twice and both times the beef was *perfect*.  Nine bucks and your snarfing down a gold-standard burger and loving life.  Yum!"}
{"text":"North Park Lounge is a place I go to regularly because it's just so darn good and consistent.  Get the Lounge Fries (maybe with a side of Lipitor??) because they're fried, cheesy glorious-ness.  They are a must have at NPL.  As far as entrees go, I have many favorites.  The Black and Blue cheeseburger is delicious with caramelized onions and bleu cheese on a 1/2 lb quality patty of beef.  The Italian hoagie has the perfect ratio of toasted crustiness to softness of the bread.  The meat isn't that mystery meat you get at other places but lean, flavorful Italian meats.  The French Onion soup is served in a generous crock with an even more generous portion of cheese melted and gooey on top. So good on a fall or winter day.  The salads are huge.  The steak salad is one of my favorites in the area and is served \"Pittsburgh-style\" with French fries on it (of course!).  The servers are friendly and many of them have been there for years.  Always quick to refill your drink or give you a recommendation if you can't decide what to order.  There are a TON of TVs, so definitely a great place to catch a game.  They have lots of events and contests that go on (Karaoke, Trivia night, etc.) so something to check out when you're there."}
{"text":"This place is alright....I personally enjoy the North Park Clubhouse better, but as a whole the menu is standard bar food fare with a few dinner options available.   I have always received good service though which makes up for the middle of the road dining food options."}
{"text":"I've heard both good and bad things about NPL but never made it out here myself until last night. The larger 'outside' bar / patio area was packed, so we opted to sit in the smaller bar area. There were a handful of people at the bar and another group at a booth behind us. Our waitress, Dana, was very friendly. We told her that it was our first time here and she gave us some suggestions. The menu is a little big, which I am not a fan of. I prefer a smaller menu, with a few great options done right.   I ended up going with the Salmon, Apple, and Walnut Salad ($11.99) - which was a large piece of salmon on top of a bed of mixed greens, crumbled blue cheese, craisins, and candied walnuts. My husband got the Cajun Pasta ($13.99), which is penne pasta tossed with chicken, sausage, tomatoes, and roasted red peppers in a cajun cream sauce. Also comes with 3 garlic lover rolls. My husband really enjoyed his meal. I took a bit of both the pasta and a roll, and had to agree that both were very good. My salmon salad was also very good - light and refreshing. I went with the balsamic dressing, which I also liked. However, I didn't like the candied walnuts, they were too sweet and I only ate a few of them. The apples slices were fresh and the piece of salmon was huge. My only complaint with the salmon was that I like all of my meat cooked medium well - yes, even fish - and I felt it could have been cooked a little longer. I'm sure any one else would have thought it was fine, though. Can't fault them, as I should have spoken up. My only other grip would be that there was way too much lettuce compare to the amount of apples and other ingredients. When I was done eating, there was a ton of lettuce still left on the plate.   Our waitress was attentive and came over to our table just enough. A manager also stopped by and asked how our meal was. The restaurant was busy, but was kept very clean and the bathroom was clean, too. NPL also seems to have an extensive draft beer list, although I didn't look much into it as I've been trying to stay away from alcohol unnecessarily - packs on the lbs! Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would definitely return, especially to sit on the patio or to watch a game."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about North Park Lounge (NPL).  So far my guy and I have come here twice, once for a Friday evening dinner in February and once for a Tuesday evening dinner back in March.  On both occasions my burger and sweet potato fries were solid, but other aspects of this place have left me feeling as though NPL isn't quite the place for me.  NPL was packed during our Friday night experience, and I don't doubt that's the case most Friday nights.  The wait wasn't so bad, though standing around near the bathrooms and claw machine wasn't an ideal waiting scenario.  During our wait we got a good look at the clientele situation, which is basically everyone--college kids looking to let loose, middle-agers equally letting loose, families, couples.  I noticed at least 2 toddlers in attendance, which was odd to me being that NPL seems to be just as focused on the bar/lounge aspect of the establishment as it is on the food and that most customers appeared to be enjoying more than a couple adult beverages.  Anyway, NPL seems to be a place where everyone is welcome.  During that first dinner Husband's fish sandwich was terrible--very bready with just a thin, dry fish fillet.  A shame for a region that boasts some pretty amazing big fried fish sandwiches.  (In case you're interested, I think the best fish sandwich is at no-frills Harry's Place off Route 51, about 30 minutes away.)  My burger, on the other hand, was solid.  It was cooked close to the medium-rare I had specified, and the seasoning was in-your-face but not totally overwhelming.  The sweet potato fries, which I order often at various establishments, were very good.  The White Russian I had with my dinner was the worst I've ever had.  More on NPL's White Russian in the next paragraph.  During our second dinner at NPL we kept if safe and ordered burgers.  Our waitress that day wasn't particularly pleasant, but because she was chatty I did take the opportunity to ask her about the White Russian before ordering one.  She explained that at the bar the beverage gun has a button specifically for White Russians.  In other words, the bartender pushes a button and White Russian spurts into the glass, no mixing necessary.  Needless to say my Tuesday night White Russian was just as bad as the Friday night White Russian.  Funny how some bars employ \"mixologists\" who are so into preparing pricey handcrafted cocktails with a hundred ingredients, and other bars have guns that not only measure the alcohol but that actually go a step further and mix the drink.  The dichotomy of bartending!  I prefer a happy middle ground.  I like that I can come here for a decent burger; however, I can't currently justify giving North Park Lounge more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's funny to see a \"North Park Lounge\" situated just after the large, Welcome to Murrysville, the Gateway to Westmoreland County, sign.  But hey, sometimes when North meets East it is a good thing.  And in this case, a very good thing. The North Park Lounge is situated off Rt. 22 in the new plaza that once housed the Old Blue Spruce Pool.  This is a large establishment with dining that includes booths, high top tables, and a large bar area.  Plenty of TVs for watching your favorite Pittsburgh teams and a lot of seating to meet with friends.  In warm weather they have garage door walls that open to let in the warm weather.  In the winter there are large heaters kept running to keep things warm. Great specials on pizza and wings combos.  For Lent, they have a great fish sandwich that I dare you to eat all in one sitting.  Lots of beers on tap and the service is pretty quick.  This is a great addition to Murrysville."}
{"text":"Their lounge fries are fantastic. Always get them. Service is usually very good and I have never had a problem. Another good menu item is their buffalo chicken flatbread."}
{"text":"Average bar food and average service.  We met up with family one night for dinner one weeknight because someone suggested The Lounge. The name didn't spark confidence and we feared the worst from looking up Yelp reviews but overall was not too terrible.  Our waitress was forgetful...we watched her take our beer to the opposite side of the room before bringing it back to our table for instance.  The fried zucchini appetizer was good...thick slices breaded & topped with parmesean cheese. For me it was the highlight of the evening.  Hubby had a burger that he was satisfied with. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The chicken had a nice char but needed seasoning.  They had a good selection of draft beer so we ordered. Both glasses arrived with no head. Very disappointing.   Family ordered crab cakes and they looked full of crab meat. He also ordered risotto which I did taste...it was rubbish don't waste your money. Another ordered fried chicken strips which she enjoyed.  Overall, I was fed but I don't see us returning."}
{"text":"I've been to the NPL several times before, but just for drinks. I visited this week for dinner and I was satisfied! First of all, the place is a sensory overload. Lots going on. Fun decor, games, a prize wheel and a popcorn machine. This definitely is a great place for kids!   Service was average and the waitress was friendly. I ordered a turkey pretzel sandwich. It was good, however a little small. My upgraded to sweet potato fries. Still good, not great, but good. My bf ordered a chicken wrap and enjoyed it.   Basic bar food with some homecooked weekly specials. Kitchen is open late and definitely a place where you can have some fun. Parking is always available!"}
{"text":"We had 21 family members here last night and this was the perfect place for us to come. We were loud and drinking margaritas, but the food was great and the service was outstanding - so much so that even today our crew is still talking about how great our server, Jaymee, was. None of us had an empty glass all evening, and when the bill came we were shocked at how inexpensive it was for the amount of food and drinks we had. Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Really awesome! Love the wings....made me and my boyfriend really gassy...we were farting all over each other the whole night... But worth it"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Lounge for years with my family and it is always a place we take out of area visitors to.  Like stated before, it's a 'Cheers' type place, but almost leans towards a TGI Friday's type place, but with a friendlier staff.  The service has always been quick and prompt and the staff is friendly and treats you respectably. Any requests are normally handled without and issue. Quite often the owner, Mark, will stop by your table to either ask how things are going or even deliver your food. Its definitely a quality I like to see in a restaurant when the owner is so involved in his investment and is there to ensure that everyone is enjoying themselves.  As for the food, I doubt theres much, if anything that is not good to order. I have tried a range of their food from the Lounge fries, cheese steaks, burgers, fish sandwiches, and wraps, and have never been disappointed. Now I'm not a huge salad fan because I love sinking my teeth into some type of meat, my mother and sister always enjoy them and rarely order anything else.  There beer specials are also quite good and for a first timer, I'd suggest getting some Lounge Fries (Cheese and Bacon with Ranch dressing) along with a beer and the Giant Fish sandwich. *drool*"}
{"text":"Love the pizza the steak and cheese and the place.  Try to hit one of their restaurants every time I am in the Burgh.  Plenty if TV screens to watch the game and just a good local joint.  You can always count on a hockey game being on during season in this place.   Hoping Detroit beats Boston tonight in this sudden death OT. Go wings  Had the worst bar tender in a long time. She is more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care Had the worst bar tender in a long time. He is more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care of.  Still a 5 even with a horrible bar tender"}
{"text":"Though NPL boasts an extensive menu with lots of good choices, I'm awarding a fourth star for one appetizer (which might as well be an entree): the delicious, creative, and well-executed BBQ Chicken Ranch Dip.  A multi-cheese blend is swirled with barbecue sauce and a hint of ranch dressing, topped with a generous helping of chicken chunks, and served next to a basket of tortilla chips with which to scoop the gooey and hearty symphony of salt, meat and cheese.  I haven't had the chance to explore a significant number of the offerings, but I suspect there are a few other gems scattered throughout the less impressive options--which are still not bad."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, lots of fun. The food is good but they need a wider selection on the menu.   Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Drink specials are always good. Every day of the week. The food is not the best. Got a roadhouse burger and chicken salad and three beers all together. Check was $30.00. The salad was head lettuce, a few chicken strips, and the top parts of the celery stock no one eats. Not worth almost $11. I'll be back, but not for the food."}
{"text":"I will say this, i  haven't had a bad experience here in the many times I have attended and I will give you a tip...if you are going on a Friday and think you will sit at the bar, be forewarned,  you probably won't. The place is full of regulars who arrive an hour early , at least, just to get a seat at the bar and they know each other so they are watching and waiting for seats to open. It is a great crew,  a family really,  and fun if you can be so lucky to be a guest with a regular. Go anyway, but be ready to wait regardless,  it's busy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Update: so I went back here and had a steak salad. The whole experience was decent. The next day I was out and about and I realized I didn't have my debit card and I realized this was the last place I was. I called and explained the situation and the man on the phone told me to hang on and he would go talk to a manager. After being put on hold for about 10 minutes he gets back on the phone and says that they were a little busy right now and they asked if they could call me back in a few minutes. I said okay fine. Almost two hours go by and no call. I decide to just go in and ask. I had to wait about 15 minutes for the manager to find time to go check to see if they had it. They did, thank goodness. I was just a bit ticked off that they couldn't take the 5 minutes to check for me while I was on the phone. Kind of rude to treat a paying customer that way."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food. Definitely worth coming back and the food prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Good solid place for comfort food.   Garlic rolls are amazing. I had the Reuben.  Good flavor but only on the good side of average.   My wife had a cheese burger and said it was very good. Family friendly atmosphere in the restaurant and a fun atmosphere at the bar."}
{"text":"Average food, with a busy atmosphere. Home to many regulars which may or may not be a plus for you. The bar is definitely the focal point and main reason why people go. The service is average and may or may not result in a decent experience. I would suggest this place to someone who is looking for an average meal with and average price. Lots of options to choose from"}
{"text":"The salted pretzel milkshake has more salt in it than any other drink I've ever tasted. Very bad. This was however their first month of operation so I will change my review if the second trip is better"}
{"text":"In general, I am always satisfied with NPL. I live close and it's always a go-to for a quality, delicious meal at the right price. My boo and I stopped in for lunch and sat ourselves, but didn't realize the table was dirty till we sat. A lady came over to wipe it and did not acknowledge our existence whatsoever ... Super awkward and she looked miserable as all hell. Lucky this woman was not our server. We were greeted shortly after and from that point the service was very commendable. My boo got the giant fish sandwich and as you see in the photos, it lived up to its namesake. I got the BBQ chicken appetizer dip as my meal because I had t before at the cranberry location and it was fantastic... This time tho it was not as delicious. Also I asked for flatbread with it instead of chips and was told it was a $1 upcharge. That didn't make sense to me because the spinach artichoke dip comes with the flatbread and it's the same price... But whatever. Chips were stale and I ended up getting the flatbread anyway which was very good. Overall a pleasant lunch experience for the most part ."}
{"text":"Local restaurant I always visit when I am in town. Solid pub food that is reasonably priced and usually good service that is friendly and sincere.   My go to are wings or the Italian Hoagie."}
{"text":"Ate outdoors on this occasion on their covered porch.  It's huge, noisy as all get out as it is and then the music played over the loud speakers was loud as all heck, too.    TVs are everywhere if that's what you came for.  Food was decent enough for me.  I ordered habanero/mango fish tacos and they were good and not all that spicy.  There were three huge tacos which were one more than I could eat.  They came with chips and salsa which was pretty good.   My husband complained that his burger ordered medium rare was more like medium well-done.  His complaint, as with most burger joints, is that why do they advertise that you can order the temperature, when they obviously just cook all of them the same way.  \"Sigh\", says he.  Service was ok, food was ok, atmosphere was loud."}
{"text":"A dive bar with a family atmosphere, north park lounge is a great place to hang out. The food did not disappoint and the service is very good. If you're looking for the American experience, it's here, with televisions at every table in addition to several larger ones at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a vast improvement from when I used to come here before I moved to Tampa. The menu has better items and a variety. One thing is in Pittsburgh you always get fries on a dinner salad! That was something unique to here. The restaurant was very cold inside. There was 10 of us and they automatically added gratuity but the severs were still very attentive. I got a burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was good but the fries were not great they tasted like regular fries that were colored Orange...Very bland. They have huge fish sandwiches and my uncle ordered pizza. It looked lack luster as well. Like a kids pizza not cheesy at all. It's a good place to come for familiar food. Nothing special but still good. It was very busy and it's one of those restaurants everyone congregates at in the suburbs on a Friday night because there is nothing else to do. By the way the dessert options suck. We would have ordered one but they were weird. Like who doesn't have a brownie with ice cream...cheesecake...etc they had apple tart and some French thing trying to be like an upscale restaurant lol um no."}
{"text":"Mmm. That pulled pork.  The food was so good. For takeout, I'd put them in my top 5. My sandwich was hot and fairly neat in the takeout container, everything that was supposed to be crisp was, and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Median age is 80.  If you are coming in for a quick beer, forget it.  The employees are much more interested in talking to each other than in serving you.  It's hot, it's cold.  The temperature is never level.  I felt menopausal just sitting at the bar.  I have seen them serve parents (with their children at the table) alcohol until the police have been called.  People are loud and obnoxious.  Never again."}
{"text":"Always so yummy! I had the cheeseburger soup and buffalo chicken wrap which were both delish! always such a fun spot to hang out in - lively! And the wait staff is always really good and friendly! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty busy but the place is seriously huge, multiple rooms, so we didn't have to wait for a table or for service.   The food: GOOD. they have a pretty big selection: burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, something for everyone to leave completely satisfied. Prices are so reasonable especially since the portions are HUGE! My table reacted with a \"wow that's huge\" when we got served our food as did the table behind us...so I'm sure they hear it pretty often!! The food isn't out of this world memorable probably because they just stick to basics but what they do make...they make it right because everything really was so freaking good.   The atmosphere is great too. Like I said it's huge, plenty of rooms and plenty of space. There's lots of TVs so I assume they always have some type of sporting event on. There was absolutely nothing to complain about during our visit here! We had great food and great service from Nicole who was so nice and so attentive but also so chill! 10/10 would recommend this place for a nice little lunch or dinner spot"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome and they serve you Pinot Grigio in a goblet. Nothing beats a fried shrimp platter and a copious amount of wine in one glass after a long day."}
{"text":"Vegetarian options are always a disappointment. I've ordered every meat free option on the menu & the food always tastes bland."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great food specials, all the food is delicious, and both the bar and dining areas have great ambience. Outdoor patio bar has roll down windows for when it gets cold. Casual setting, you can go here on a date, with coworkers or with a family. We've tried the fish sandwich, Pittsburgh salad, the pork tacos and the boneless wings (mango habenero) and everything was great. Fantastic service"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to grab some standard bar food with a beer.  They also have all the games on on Sunday and hockey throughout the week.  The staff have been great and very friendly; my wife and I are new to town and one of the be tenders (I believe her name was Amber) was very kind in referencing some ideas for us to do and check out...I had their classic cheese burger and it was excellent.  The burger was large and cooked to my liking perfectly.  I highly recommend this place for a great local feel."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have always had tremendous service while enjoying a fantastic meal. I have had the Texan burger, Apple Walnut salad, French onion soup, lounge fries, the nachos, Turkey bacon Swiss pretzel sandwich and the Cajun chicken pasta which is by far my favorite, but they are all excellent choices at a fair price. The portions are huge and you will most likely have leftovers. Parking lot is huge and there are plenty of spaces. Tv's are throughout the restaurant and have a variety of different games on."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a busy Wednesday night. I was originally told it would be 50 minutes for a table of 6 (which i understood with them being new) and got a seat at the bar while I waited for my party to arive. The beer selection is excellent, while the wine could have used a little bit of work. The bartenders were quick and attentive.  We were seated within 30 minutes, which was nice considering the original wait time i was given. Our waitress was extremely friendly and on top of everything. The food was all on point: the burgers, salmon strawberry salad and jerk salad (or something of the sort), pulled pork sandwich, fries....all great.   I am only giving this place 4 stars due to the outside cabana bar not being finished yet, but overall we really enjoyed our meal here. This place is exactly what Murrysville needed. I am looking forward to returning for a drink on the patio eventually!"}
{"text":"Great place been going here for years. The Pizza, French onion soup, Cajun pasta, burgers, the list goes on have all been good. Whenever there was a probably they've always took car of it. Can really busy during games."}
{"text":"NPL in Murrysville is pretty huge.  And pretty loud.  Great place to go for animated discussion and mostly bar food.  The service was slow and blamed the kitchen for any glitches - and there were a couple of them.  We started with the nachos and a couple of the signature drinks from the 'breast cancer awareness' drink menu, in support of one of the employees who is going through treatment - I thought that was a great show of support from the establishment.  Hubs had the fish sandwich and proclaimed it to be very good.  I had a salad, which was good.  Would I go again?  Probably not, there are too many really great alternatives to settle for middle of the road."}
{"text":"After two subsequent visits we are giving this place thumbs down. Their steak sandwich' is nothing more than steak ums, piled with french fries (Pramanti's rip off), and lousy tasting overall. And for close to $9? I don't think so. 2nd visit: 'giant fish' sandwich had absolutely no flavor! Guiness beer on tap special was watered down. Wife had steak salad with wilty lettuce. Wrote to them and they told me nitrogen valve on the keg tap was faulty...maybe so but don't they taste test their tapped beer every day??? Seems like this should have been a protocol. Overall...so-so to lousy food, lack of quality control beers, noisy, crowded, and terrible to find parking. Never more."}
{"text":"Good, dependable, bar/traditional american food. A staple in the North Hills for years. Great staff and attentive management."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places and i think my husband's favorite place for his burger, better than actual Burger places. The patio/outdoor bar is entertaining and the food is delish! Their homemade dressing are so fresh tasting and the salads are huge....the giant pretzel is a big hit as well. Can't wait to come back, next weekend :)"}
{"text":"Murrysville. Finally a few new restaurants are coming here. I think Dick's Diner was the only place in town for years. Couple pizza joints and a Mickey D's. That was it for a long time. (I like Dick's Diner, but...)  Fast forward to today.  Lots of new places. Don't have to go to Monroeville or points west to eat. North Park Lounge is one of the new locations. Casual bar food is the fare. And they do it well. Good sandwiches, salads and the like. They keep churning it out and we'll keep stopping by. Grandkids like it too."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I come here for lunch several times a week. The wait staff has come to know us and do all they can to help us speed through the lunch break, since we get only 45 minutes!   The food is terrific, especially the French fries! And we all love the homemade ranch dressing.   They have a lunchtime loyalty program, and if you go on your birthday, you get to spin the wheel for a variety of prizes! Lots of fun and great food . . .what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food is great. I have been here a few times. The outside deck is sweet heated as well. I just don't like how loud at the outside bar the music. I like loud music but so loud even if you scream the person next to you still can't hear you. Try turning down 3 to 5 levels lower so it's still loud yet the guests can leave with out bleeding ear drums."}
{"text":"Had the turkey pretzel sandwich with chips on the side, it was fantastic.  The price was great. Our whole meal with 2 kids and one appetizer clocked in at around $40, so I feel like we got a great value for the money spent.  This is a new incredibly clean amd friendly upscaleish sports bar type atmosphere.  I was very glad to see bo shellfiah on the menu as I have a severe allergy.  We will definitely be back.  I hope to try the burgers or a reuben and maybe an appetizer sampler next time."}
{"text":"$8 for a Sam Adams stout !?!  The italian hoagies are good. I've heard that the pizza is good. The wings are just ok (too salty, too fatty). I think the food at the Route 8  NPL clubhouse location is better."}
{"text":"I visited  this restaurant since they open..good food with a  great view * few restaurant pittsburgh had a similar thing*"}
{"text":"NPL is our go-to place.   Great happy hour and I love their combo specials."}
{"text":"Outdoor bar service was horrible. The waitress skipped over us for about 10 minutes as if we told them we had other guest we were waiting on. Once they finally acknowledged us there was no apologies, no excuses just a \"what will you all be having\"?  After that we proceeded to watch the staff give prompted service to other guest at the bar. Needless to say there was no words said nor no tip left for their poor service they provided. Thanks for a great first (and only) time experience keep up the bad work."}
{"text":"Good happy hour, always get the grilled chicken salad and content with it. Very good service and fun on birthdays"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to meet some friends for dinner.   The waitresses and the hostess were very nice , hostess had a booth cleaned just for us even though there were empty tables.  Our food came really fast, and everything was good, I had a sandwhich with a pretzel bun very good!  I got one of there specialty drinks the strawberry palmer, it was good.  One of my friends got a cosmo and said it was too strong she couldnt even drink it.  The food is pretty good here and its really cheap.  We were there on a tuesday and they got really busy, looks like alot people stop there after work."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a couple of weekends ago with our nephew and it was awful. First this place was built to suit, and yet it's awkward inside. Nothing has a proper place and little rooms for seating are just shoved all over the place. I had to walk through the kitchen area to pee and I had to dodge servers. Plus the women's bathroom was gross. Not clean, my toilet didn't flush and paint was chipping all I've the walls. The service was horrendous. It seems like they hired a bunch of young rich kids from Murrysville that have never worked and don't plan to it ever. On two occasions while we were there I saw people leave because the hostess wasn't around. She was too busy chatting up her buddies in the kitchen. Our food took forever! I got the pizza and salad combo. The pizza tasted like skating rink pizza. Just straight shit. Service took 2 1/2 hours for lunch. I will never come back. I was actually embarrassed for them."}
{"text":"Their sweet potato fries are so good! Unfortunately, they didn't come with my burger but they were so crispy and flavorful. I like that all the burgers have NPL stamped on the bun! Fun! Prices are okay for the burgers and sandwiches; it's what you would expect.  Our server was friendly and the atmosphere was lively but not overly loud. For some reason there were so many babies and families on the night we went...  Location is nice and tucked into a modern little shopping strip. Nothing special, but good for a simple, all-American meal."}
{"text":"The wife and I came here on a Monday night for dinner.  The inside seating is nothing spectacular, but the outside area is awsome.  Nice bar, lots of large flat screens, and some decent beer selections.  I ate the cuban pretzel sandwich which was very good, but it was so small.  I got about 13 fries with it as well.  I don't usually gripe about portion size but come on!  My wife got wings and hoagie combo.  The wings were definitely all right with the hot ranch sauce.  The itallian hoagie seriously tasted like a Fuzzy's band hoagie.  That's awful or anything just disappointed.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  I'll be back but probably just for beers and a ballgame."}
{"text":"We have been to North Park Lounge many times since they have opened here in Murrysville.  We usually come here to have a few drinks while watching a game or if we want another drink before we head home late at night we stop by here since they are open late.  It's really nice that they are open until 1am and they are less than 10 minutes from our house.         We have eaten a  few times here too.  My go to is their Italian hoagie with a slice of pizza.  The hoagie is good and surprisingly their pizza is good as well.  It's not the best pizza around but it's good which is ok with me.  We have watched Pirate and Penguins games here and have had a good time.       I'm finally writing a review for NPL because we started coming here for their Tuesday trivia night.  It's in the bar section which is opened up in the warmer months.  That area is really nice especially when it's not too busy.  There are a lot tv's around and it's a good atmosphere.  The trivia is fun but we have seen better.  The girl that hosts the trivia seems like a rookie and it's hard to hear her if your not real close by.  Trivia night is newer there so there is room to improve and hopefully it does.  Regardless we have had a good time during trivia there on Tuesday nights.  They have specials on Corona and Miller Lite that night also there is a special on pizza.  So Tuesday's are a  good night for us to go to NPL.       The beer here is ok.  With such a big bar and draft list we would think they would have a lot of beer that we like.  They really don't.  You have your usual Miller lite, Bud, Yuengling, and other traditional beer.  They have craft beer but nothing outside of the box that we really like.  So we are down on the beer list here.      Overall we do like NPL.  Is it our first or second choice when we go out?  No it is not but it is a decent option and I do recommend trying out trivia night here."}
{"text":"Every time I go I try to order something different off of the large menu and have yet to be disappointed. I think my favorite thing so far is the Lounge fries and all of their cheesy, bacon-y (Is that a word?) goodness. The fresh garlic rolls wlll absolutely leave you stuffed and the potato skins are the perfect thing to sober up after a night of $10 Rum Buckets (4 shots of rum plus a ton of fruit juice) The buckets also come in Vodka but I haven't had that one. They have awesome daily drink specials including the aforementioned rum buckets being only $7 on Sundays! A large draft selection, but not so large you ever have to worry about getting a beer that has been tapped for 3 months. As far as wine goes they have a nice enough selection for a sports bar. Oh and if you like sweet drinks you can't go wrong with any of their Island Oasis bevvies. I'm not a fan, but the girlfriend says they are all excellent. The indoor bar is really nice and tends to be a more laid back option than the outdoor bar. And if the bar isn't your scene they have a nice seperated dining room. Above all else I must admit I am always impressed with how clean the place is considering it is always packed when I go. I can't wait for the Cabana bar to open next year, this place is exactly what Murrysville needed!"}
{"text":"Completely unremarkable - for me it happened to hit on a couple particular button issues.  The decor and service we very nice, as a met a client for lunch this week.  We were in no rush and we took a while to order, drinks were prompt, and the cheerful server stopped by frequently.  The miss was the food - the fish sandwich was not beer battered ( it was breaded) and was clearly not cod.  From the menu \"Six ounces of our award winning cod dipped and breaded in our secret beer batter and fried to a golden brown. Served with fresh cut fries and cole slaw.\"   I would love to know what Award this won  (Why restaurants insist on saying BS like this and \"world famous\" I have no clue)   The fish was fine, not old or off-tasting, but just seems to be out of the (secret) freezer and deepfried.  It seemed like one person wrote the menu and another makes the food.    The fries - SHOULD have been good (had been fresh cut, and cooked, seasoned OK) but were lukewarm and had been sitting around for a while -did not finish them.  Being a business lunch I did not say anything to the server - but I do not know if I would have - these issues typically go much deeper then can be corrected by one customer's comments."}
{"text":"Used to love to get their fish sandwich which was always a good choice. Went today and got an over-fried breaded piece of thin fish on an oversized not-fresh bun. I recall the menu stating beer-battered but this hard piece of fish was breaded which gave an entirely different taste. I would have given 2 stars but the waitress was super nice and friendly which amped the rating. Draft beer was not very cold. Will likely not be returning to NPL for a long time."}
{"text":"just eat the chicken salad...... or the shroom swiss burger.....nuf said"}
{"text":"Can't beat the atmosphere outside at the bar.   All of the food I have ordered has been very good.   Great value for lunch specials.     Sometimes service can be a little aloof, but it is something I expect with a brand new restaurant and wasn't bad enough to be a turnoff."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice covered patio to sit under. Great place to watch sports or have a nice lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to get lunch, dinner, or a late night snack and a drink. They have combination dinners that are amazing (pizza slices, hoagies, wings, salads) and a hidden gem is the fish tacos. Used to go here all the time when I was in the area but still make it a point to visit there when I am in town. The bar has a lot of televisions as well so if you are into sports or anything you will love it! They offer take out too and the food is still amazing in the container. Probably the best restaurant out of their chain in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was pretty good. I was impressed with the size of the place. Form the outside it doesn't look any larger than a typical restaurant, but once you're in there, it's massive. Two dining areas indoors and a cabana bar and huge patio outside. I had the fish tacos which were pretty good. They have a huge menu so I'm looking forward to trying something new next time. Staff is also friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I visited here many times over the years.  As my diet changed, I stopped visiting due to no good vegetarian/vegan options.  I am happy to say that I stopped by on the way back from a softball game in North Park for a beer and discovered the Roasted Zucchini & Hummus Flatbread.  This is and appetizer that eats like a meal.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EATEN IN MONTHS!  DELICIOUS! Thanks for offering an option to continue coming back..."}
{"text":"I don't go to Pittsburgh that often, but when I do there is always a stop at the NPL.  This place has an extensive menu (including lounge fries), access to every game through one of it's plethora of TVs, a decent sized bar, and a wheel of prizes that you get to spin on your birthday.  What more can you ask for?  The downside is the occasionally long wait.  not many other options in the area and you can tell."}
{"text":"Travel to Pitt for work and this is always a must if I'm in the area. Burgers, fish sandwich, and pizza(total surprise) are all great and huge beer selection. Staff and regulars are all awesome. Huge Pitt sports fan base that welcomes everyone. Great time."}
{"text":"I stop here regularly for lunch both on my own and for work. I never have a bad experience and the food is always great. The outdoor seating area is amazing in good weather and bad.  The walls they add in for the winter are great and keep the cold out along with the many fireplaces and heaters.  We always sit outside.   The food specials are nice and rotate through the week and the salads are huge. I would definitely give this place a go."}
{"text":"Great place, been to the other ones in the past and this one was my favorite . Clean,  stylish, roomy, great beer selection, food was awesome as well . Staff was super nice and made.the experience a very nice one."}
{"text":"Worth the trip just for the ranch dressing alone!  I haven't been here in years and as native Pittsburgher returning to the area - this is the kind of food I've been missing!  Good service, lots of choices, fast and fresh!  I had the chicken tortellini salad....and I'll be back to have it again and again!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but on certain days the food is bland - it all depends. I come here when there are certain foods that we want to have.  Altogether, this place is always pack when I drive by and when I do come here, the wait is usually 5 minutes. This a great place to take people that do not live in Pittsburgh so they can have that \"Pittsburgh hospitality\" style meal. :-)"}
