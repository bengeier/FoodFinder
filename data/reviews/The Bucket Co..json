{"text":"Ever the fan of Newmarket Main Street and it's best in class Mexican restaurant Made in Mexico, I was more than a little excited when I learned that the owners would be opening a spin off restaurant directly across the street from their current location.  But why open a Mexican restaurant across from a mexican restaurant? Well, I wondered this as well until I stepped into The Bucket Co for the first time. TBC is Mexican inspired seafood with a Tex-mex flair. And in addition to the bounty of seafood options, we've finally we've got somewhere other than Lone Star to visit for sizzling fajitas, and freshly made corn and flour tortillas (and we're talking made to order fresh).  In terms of design concept, it's very similar to its sister restaurant, Made In Mexico but with a little less Mexican schwag and a little more cheeky art work describing the benefit of tequila (there are many).  Being thirsty upon arrival my DC and I haphazardly ordered the 2L pitcher of freshly made sangria for $28. Now if you've never attempted to split 2L of sangria, take it from me - this is not a two person feat. Despite the affordable price 2L is enough for 4 people to easily be satisfied. My DC and I were stuffed and swimming by the end of the meal. But man was that delicious!  Wanting to sample as many options as possible we decided to share an appetizer and two main courses. For the appetizer course we shared the Cheese Empanaditas (small sized deep fried cheese Empanadas). These were served piping hot and gooey with cheese (just how I like' em). What I liked even more about this course was that the Empanaditas were served with a side of freshly cut and deep fried potato slices (almost deep fried to chips). These made great dipping companions and a nice break from the hot cheesey goodness of the mini Empanadas.  It was then that we realized our hunger got the better of us as our two main courses hit the table. 1) Lobster Tacos, 2) Surf and Turf (steaming) fajitas!  1) The lobster tacos were unbelievable! If you see my picture you can see that they spared no expense on this dish as the lobster was literally pouring out of the three flour tortillas they were served on. The filling with the Lobsters was so delicious that it could easily stand on it's own, BUT adding some cooked peppers and onions, refried beans, hot sauce and freshly squeeze lime only made the experience more incredible. I'm not sure how they make money on this dish because I've been to Red Lobster and not had this much meat.   2) The Surf'N Turff (steak and jumbo shrimp) fajitas were likely the BEST I've had in the GTA/Toronto ever. Not only was the steak cooked exactly to my liking (medium/medium-rare), the shrimp HUGE and plump, and the peppers and onions perfectly seasoned and cooked BUT there was SO. DAMN. MUCH!! Easily could have been shared with another person. I would come back for this once a week an shamelessly stuff myself. No Problems!  At this point I had thrown in the towel and was trying to polish off the bottom half of my mini Sangria Keg with little luck. Then came a special treat that we weren't anticipating. Somehow between breaths we were talked into trying their deep fried cheesecake chimichangas..... let me write that out again:  Deep Fried. Cheese Cake. Chimichanga.  Alone any of those three items would be enough to stop a mans heart, but combined as one item and stuffed into my gut against my will (seriously) and I nearly exploded.   ************************************ Fast forward to days later when I finally awoke from the food induced coma this meal put me in and for some sick reason I was hungry again and craving another trip to the bucket co. Give the newest spot on Main Street a shot, but heed my warning: Large portions, low prices = gut busting Mexican Seafood inspired food coma.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"It was our first time \"back\" to the previous location of Made In Mexico. The menu is much more slanted towards seafood and the addition of fajitas.  We had guac and chips to start because the homemade chips are the best I've had anywhere. Thankfully they're still doing it the same as across the street.  My wife and I shared the lobster tacos as an entree, which were new to the \"old\" menu and very good. Decent portion size (3 tacos) filled with nicely prepared lobster meat.  For dessert, the churros are a good bet as was the deep fried ice cream.  The Bucket Co is very similar to Made In Mexico. They made subtle interior changes to the restaurant. The menu is quite different but different enough to make it worthwhile.  We like both places and we'll be sure to frequent both places.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Gotta give this place a strong 3 star but I was really hoping it would have been a 5 star. I love good Mexican food. Chips and salsa were just bad. How do you mess up chips and pico?? I ordered a steak fajita style entree that was ok. Also had the carnitas that we really didn't enjoy. Sorry to say I won't be back to eat here."}
{"text":"Headline: Not for the faint of heart, or for those who want to stick to their New Years' resolution.  They provided the food for a Yelp Elite soiree in January 2014 at Tequila 185 in Newmarket.  I have to say the food was superb.    *Basa Fish taco - so I'm not the biggest fan of basa, but it was nicely breaded, crisp and still had a hint of fish.  Add the guac and salsa, and absolutely delectable.   *Chicken taco - very fresh, nicely seasoned.  I added  the sauteed veggies with haberno salsa and it was awesome. WARNING - haberno salsa is VERY HOT!  Tasty though.   *Deep fried cheesecake chimichanga.  I don't like fried food, but these were absolutely awesome and the churros - OMFG! Fresh, hot, crisp out of the oven! I wanted to keep eating them!    Verdict: Next time I'm this far north, I'm definitely going to pay this place a visit and I suggest you should too."}
{"text":"This is the first time We went to the Bucket Co. Friday night for some drinks and food around 8 pm. The restaurant was busy but only had to wait around 10 min. for a table. The restaurant is not that big and is the sister company Made In Mexico.   Our drinks were alright, nothing crazy special -very standard.  Our food took about 40 min to receive. . Service was slow.  We ordered a sampler platter which was not good at all - it was full of grease, calamari tasted like rubber, the stuffing in the other items was almost empty and mainly only deep fried wraps.  Our friend ordered a battered fish bucket with coleslaw as the side. He said it was pretty good assuming you enjoy fish and chips. The chips were deep fried potato chips essentially.   The servers all were very nice and couteous. We also noticed the bar tender talking to many different tables to say hello. Our waitress noticed we ate less than half our platter and had offered to take it off our bill... which was nice of her to do so since we were prepared to pay for it.  Overall,  if you enjoy fish and chips and your food deep fried then this place would be a good fit for you.  Otherwise, this would not my first choice of restaurant recommendations.  We most likely would not visit the restaurant again because of the menu options."}
{"text":"Lobster Tacos? Probably not in Mexico, but when I saw it on the menu, it was a go!  3 nice sized tacos with my choice of sides (Frijoles Charros and slaw) quickly arrived at my table.  Substantial lobster chunks in a rich sauce and smothered in cheese - very good.  I am especially fond of the beans, rich in flavour, unlike the typical sweet baked beans in southwestern fare.  The only thing that struck me as odd was the layout of the tacos.  Three tortillas were laid out in an overlapping pattern on the plate, so only the first tortilla had a full measure of the lobster mix.  However, when I picked up the first taco, a solid third of the mix fell onto the next tortilla.  The same thing happened when I picked up the second taco, so I really did get 3 nicely filled tacos.  I hear from Kris U that the Bucket Company is an offshoot of Made in Mexico and coincidentally occupies the former location of MIM, but with a largely seafood oriented Mexican menu.  I also hear that I will be back.  Frequently."}
