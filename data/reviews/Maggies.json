{"text":"Breakfast.  It as not good and it wasn't cheap either.   Avoid the vegan 'gypsy' sauce which tastes exactly like thickened gelatinous  squash soup.  Wish is across the street.  And  Seven is 50  steps west.  Trade up."}
{"text":"This place really does hold up to its reviews. Excellent staff, great food, and amazing atmosphere. Breakfast is hearty and full of flavor. I had the eggs Benedict and was quite pleased. I've been in this neighborhood for years and had no idea this place was here till I found it on yelp. Fantastic place and great people."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with family on a Sunday, the company was great, food was not. 

I was pretty excited to try the garlic fries since I love garlicy things, however out of 6 people who got it only 1 person got \"good fries\". Most of the table got overcooked (dark brown) hard clumped together fries with no garlic, 1 person whose meal arrived a little later than the rest of the party got golden fries with nice garlicy aroma. Very inconsistent.

I got the tuna platter, first of all given that it was one of the more expensive items on the menu, several of us on the table presumed that it would be \"fresh\" tuna, but don't be fooled, this is CANNED tuna dressed with lemon. The pita that came with this platter was cold, not even toasted. The green salad that it came with was ok, everything else was unappetizing. I ate most of my food because I was hungry and didn't want to be rude (since I was with family), but I didn't enjoy it one bit.

My husband got the salmon frittata breakfast which came with fresh fruit and garlic fries. His fries were amongst the garlicless, clumpy, overcooked fries group. The frittata was way too dense and has too much potatoes and was crusted and fried. The only good thing about this dish according to my husband was the fruit and few small strips of salmon.

The good thing about this place I guess might be free coffee refills with brunch meals, but really we were not pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Place is cute and small, staff is friendly. The menu is nothing special, though. Vegan options weren't brunchy or exciting. Wilted salad, mushy waffle, too expensive for what was on offer. There are plenty of yummier places to go for brunch in the neighbourhood, where you get better food for the same price."}
{"text":"We've been to Maggie's several times, they have a small but functional patio that gets crowded on weekends.
Breakfast is the typical fare eggs, bacon, french toast.  The garlic fries are delicious, served nice and crispy.  Our friend orders the vegetarian hummus platter which is quite tasty.  Good neighborhood breakfast/brunch place at a reasonable price.
Service is fast and friendly.   The place could do with a bit of fixing up though."}
{"text":"Maggies is a place for breakfast and lunch, which makes me wish they were open at 7am. So, I found myself in need of lunch and ordered the eggplant stew. It was served hot and mildly spicy with a salad that had big slices of peppers, hummous, tabouli and some warmed flatbread. It was a lot of food for lunch, and it was served quickly. The eggplant stew was great, the coffee was good, the service was pleasant, and with tax it was just under $15. The inside is small but there's a patio. They take debit, yay. The bathroom was out of order that day, but good thing my hotel was close."}
{"text":"Just about the only place left near Yonge and Bloor to get a proper diner breakfast. This morning, mine was very good: eggs were cooked just right, not dry; bacon was extra crispy as ordered; garlic fries were as advertised (though I would much prefer a home fries option); and it's nice to have multigrain toast rather than the usual white-brown duopoly. Coffee was OK. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The place is a bit of a hole in the wall tucked back almost a block off Yonge St.  But the food and the friendly staff sure make up for what the brick and mortar is lacking.

My dad and I had the Classic Breakfast.  It's HUGE! and well prepared.  The garlic home fries are amazing (bring gum or mentos for later)  and coffee is included in the $8.99 price.

Definitely worth coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Maggies is your neighborhood greasy spoon but without the charm.
Located across the street from the glamourous Comfort Hotel, this is a convenient place to go for breakfast if you are a hotel guest and you don't know where else to go.

This place is always busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table.  
I like how the space is bright and it's nice that they have a patio for the summer.  Sitting by the window, it's always fun to people watch.  With a shelter across the street, people passing by were a mix of homeless people, condo dwellers, and shoppers getting ready to hit up Bloor street.

The breakfast menu had your standard breakfast items.
* The portions are large, but nothing that I couldn't have made at home.
* I can burn my own bacon too and it would cost me less than 10 bucks to do it.  
* Garlic fries with breakfast are alright... but I think I'm a breakfast hash type of girl.

The service was average at best.
I don't require that my coffee cup be filled to the brim all the time, but I also don't think my cup should sit there empty!

We sat there for awhile until we realized that you have to go up to the front to pay.

With other brunch options in the neighborhood, I don't think I will be returning to Maggies.  The food was overpriced, the service wasn't great, and I don't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give Maggie's a higher rating, but there were some things (most likely out of the restaurant's control) that made the experience basically A-OK.

Intro. My boyfriend and I happened to be in the area and Yelped for brunch places nearby. Maggie's popped up and he was especially sold on the description of their eggs. We arrived at around 11 and soon lots of people came after us. As a tip, just watch out for the queue of people - the owner (I assume) called a man WHO CAME AFTER US to the table meant for us. My boyfriend just talked to her and we were clearly in the restaurant before the other guest arrived so I don't know what happened. To the other guest's credit, he said that we arrived first, but it could have turned out pretty bad. 

Food. We ordered the regular eggs benedict with ham and the Florentine benedict which is basically a vegetarian option of the benedict (with spinach but you can also add meat for an additional charge). The sides included garlic fries which were very good but nothing I would come back for and fruit. Unlimited coffee came with each dish. I have to say the eggs benedict were very good (I could taste the vinegar they eggs swirled in which was okay for me). Two dishes with an extra hot chocolate came out to be $30 plus tax and tip.

Service. I didn't find the service particularly friendly. Because there is only one other waiter, it is hard to flag him down sometimes. I may come back here or I may not but I know there are brunch places aplenty so no lost if I don't.

There was a very nice patio which was opened today ad-hoc. This place is definitely very busy and if it were not for the patio being opened, about 10 people would NOT have had a chance to eat here (or would have had to wait about an hour)."}
{"text":"Maggie's was a bit disappointing given some really good reviews on yelp about it.  It's true that as eric g. says, this is probably the last breakfast/brunch diner in the area so it does have that going for it...

The food wasn't too bad but it wasn't something I'd wait over an hour for again.  I like myself some eggs prepared in a benedict fashion but I find milestones eggs benedict as good as this place...and I get seated immediately there.  The garlic fries are a great touch and the fact that the fries aren't all one size allows you to get a good mix of the small burnt and crunch vs the big hot and kinda soggy types...so each person can get the type of fries they prefer in one batch.   I don't know if thats something they are aiming for or just luck.  I do think though that many people may shy away from the garlic fries but I don't think I saw an option to alternate but may be something you want to check.

The location is pretty small.  Max seating is about 25 people.  This translates into longer wait times than normal.  They had to open up the patio to create some seating when we were heading out but they didn't do that while we waited for people to leave to be seated.

A couple of negatives:

1) A couple people came in while I was waiting and requested take out.  They were told it would take 30-40 minutes.  I don't know if this was my stomach being cranky 30 minutes into my wait, but the vibe I got from the lady (who seemed to be the owner) was like she was trying to push away business.  Take out business should be great business...they pay the same as seated customers but don't take up any overhead costs in the form of your server or seated space.  Its a gold mine.  Second, most restaurants will still take 20-30 minutes to get the food ready because there is a queue to respect of orders in the fryer (pun intended), so I felt that her emphasis on the wait time really made it seem like it was a long time.  They left without ordering and that was a great lost sale.

2) Queue of people.  It may have that small business feel, but it needs to get a big business front desk.  There is no system of highlighting who came first and i saw it a few times where they would receive a burst of people all crowding around the front door.  Unless the staff had a great memory they could make an error in seating people and create a sour experience for a potential future client.  Getting a piece of paper and writing a name down would be a useful sales expense...

I will say though that the owner does keep a sharp eye on the seated people.  Our single server kept going to tables around us and never coming to us after he dropped the food.  After I turned around and started looking for him, I saw her see me and literally guess what I wanted,and send the server to us...with ketchup (too much garlic)). 

So for what it's worth, I think I may have come on a bad day but I probably will stick to a milestones if I want some eggs next time...."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's the only place I can drag my coworkers to when I want breakfast for lunch (which happens quite a bit) because they can order salad and sandwiches off the lunch menu.  While there are lots of breakfast places in the Yonge/Bloor-Church/Wellesley area, a lot of these places only offer breakfast to a certain time and some are just breakfast all day.  Not so with Maggie's.  You can get breakfast at any time and your picky coworkers can get their so called lunch.

Likes: Love the omelettes and the garlic fries.

Dislikes: Lunch menu

Verdict: Cometh here and bring forth coworkers when thus crave some breakfast nosh."}
{"text":"Maggies is one of those weird vegetarian/vegan restaurants that you would think is healthy but in reality serves really greasy food.

I ordered eggs and bacon and I remember everything being really, really heavy but not so great on taste. The service was good, and the restaurant was super busy. The meal was definitely economical and you got a lot for your dollar. 

But if you love yourself a good, hearty delicious breakfast, I wouldn't go to Maggies. Try wish across the street for a much tastier (albeit more expensive) breakfast. 

Their vegetarian food might be better but I wouldn't recommend it for a morning meal."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed, given the reviews on yelp seem to hold this restaurant to a higher standard than what I had experienced myself. 
The service was okay... I got the boss breakfast. Don't get me wrong the quantity was very large but the quality was less than impressive. The bacon was overcooked and over salted. The bread was so stale it quite literally fell apart in my hands, I couldn't even eat it. The only part of the meal I actually enjoyed was the two pancakes that came with the meal... but let me tell you my guest did not feel the same way, there was some sort of curry sprinkled on his pancakes and he was not impressed. 
The service was quick, we only waited probably 10 minutes for breakfast, but it still wasn't worth the wait. 
And one last point... for hand squeezed Orange juice, it sure tastes a whole lot like minute maid. 
I certainly would not recommend this for their breakfast menu, and I am not willing to go back to taste their lunch menu."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast spot in the Bloor/Yonge area. The service is fast and friendly, and the portions are generous. The western omelet is my go-to here, and it comes with garlic fries, toast, and LOTS of fresh fruit including mango and pineapple (not just your regular bowl of cantaloupe."}
{"text":"I went here with some colleagues primarily because the restaurant beside it was book full. To our pleasant surprise, I found this place fairly empty on a weekday for lunch. 

Staff were very friendly, and easy going. Looks like they enjoy what they do.  Food was delicious- if you like big portions! They also have a good variety of fruit - not your typical one strawberry cut into slices and spread across the plate to look bigger. 

I'd come back- definitely recommend this homey place compared to sunset grill a block away."}
{"text":"Our family went to Maggies for breakfast based on advice from our hotel concierge.  We are thrilled that we went there.  The breakfast food was excellent.  I had the classic eggs benedict and enjoyed it.  My kids had pancakes and waffles.  The pancakes had confectioner sugar and cinnamon on them.  All of the meals came with fresh cut fruit and a side of bacon.  The service was as good as the food.  The owner came out to check on us more than once and made sure that we enjoyed our meal.
My oldest son said that he wished he lived in Toronto so that he could come to Maggies more often."}
{"text":"Someone once said to me that I had big eyes and a small stomach because I would always order a lot of food, and then be too full to finish it. But I knew that at Maggie's, whatever I could not finish I could always take it to go. Though thus far I have always managed to finish everything I order at Maggie's, I just don't eat anything else for the rest of the day.

Now, what did we think of the food? We thought it was good. But being food obsessed, we had to nitpick. In terms of my dish, I am not a big fan of garlic on my fries, but I did find that the garlic was contained on a couple of fries, so I removed these fries from my plate. The cheddar frittata could have been a bit smaller and flatter, since the center tasted a little bland. But it was nothing that could not be fixed with a little salt, and I did have all the other components on the dish to balance out the flavors. For the hollandaise sauce, I am usually a fan of hollandaise sauces that are on the lighter side with a fresh herb added to it such as dill. But these are minor adjustments that would have made a great dish spectacular. The french toast was a good portion and still moist even after having it sit there for over 20 minutes while I finished my main dish. I thought the French toast was delicious, but maybe best eaten alone and not as a side.  R's crepe was light and thin. There seemed to be too much jam, but we both agreed that it is always better to have more than not enough stuffing.

Overall, we were very happy with our meal and service. Our coffee cups were always being refilled and were given water upon our request. The waitress checked in on us just enough, and we felt well taken care of. This experience has reinforced why it is that I return to Maggie's every time I need to be comforted and I am craving a great breakfast. I may be in the minority here since the online reviews for Maggie's are not great, but if this place is so terrible, then why is it always full? Even at 10 am in the morning on a Friday (not a holiday), there were only a couple of seats available.

**Addendum

I visited Maggie's during the week for lunch and I did not like the service or food. I will continue to visit Maggie's but only for brunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Two words for Torontonians: conditional pass. I noticed that sign after I ordered. I try to avoid those ones but I don't usually look. I had to send back the sandwich as the bread was disgusting. It was oily and had some random soggy brown and grey bits on it. Then when it came back on different bread, it was better but I had to take half the bacon out because it was too salty. Overall, a disgusting sandwich. The salad it came with was fresh and tasty--definitely the highlight of the meal. Some fruit came with it too, which wasn't bad. Service was pretty friendly. The sandwich was just so bad that I can't give this a pass. It's not absolutely horrible, it's just kinda bad. They have a patio, just watch out for bird droppings... I got some bird poop back splash onto my leg during my visit."}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast place. 
Friendly staff, large fresh portions, affordable and always consistent. 
I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is great for eating breakfast at lunch time. They have quite a few vegan options and it's nice to find a place that has healthy options that actually taste good!

It can be very busy in the summer and we've often had to leave as there were no tables available at lunch time. In the winter it's a bit easier to find a spot. The interior is small (seats 25-30) and the patio seats another 20 or so. 

Service is very friendly.

They have all-day breakfast (eggs, crepes, pancakes, french toast, omelets, etc) most which can be served with salad or fries and/or fruit salad. They also have sandwiches, burgers and some Mediterranean food. Their falafel  platter is amazing.

Prices range from about $8-$12 per meal. They always have a daily specials board with 4-5 options priced at $7-$9. 

Portion sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Maggie's for a few years and it is my go to spot for brunch, but only on the weekend.  While I find the weekday staff friendly enough, the service was not as good and food was undercooked or generally low quality.  I've been to Maggie's dozens of times on the weekend and never once has the food been subpar.  The veggies are always fresh and the service is pretty standard for Toronto.  Go on the weekend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic breakfast or lunch place, this is it.  Eggs Benedict is good, garlic fries outstanding, lunch sandwiches are made to order.

It is small maybe 30 seats, the summer patio is great.  The only negative is it needs a thorough cleaning.  It's not dirty, but not clean everything looks like it is coated with a layer of grease topped with dust.  Lots of clutter on the bar and by the cash register.  If they did a deep cleaning I would have given it more stars."}
