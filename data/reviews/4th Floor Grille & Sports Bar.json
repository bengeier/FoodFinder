{"text":"Food absolutely horrible.    We went there because of the reviews on this yelp.   Chips are stale.  Burgers burnt.    Took forever to get waited on.   Worst meal in Arizona.  Horrible ....yuk!"}
{"text":"Ditto all the positive comments from other reviewers!  My 1st experience @ this sports bar was last Dec. when my daughter and I needed a late-night meal due to a very late arrival.  We were pleasingly surprised when we shared a very generously sized salad AND order of sweet potato fries. (one never knows about the quality of late-night offerings)  During our 7-day stay, we ordered other items but the sweet potato fries were our favorite.  Now, 2 mos. later, I took my husband to this bar so he could try those fries I've been raving about.  He, too, says they're THE best we've ever had.  That says a lot since we've traveled around the country.  One extra important comment: Bartender Debbie is one of THE most personable bartenders I've ever met.  Her terrific service made all of my visits really enjoyable."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here and it was amazing, the atmosphere was nice and classy, as well as clean. The staff were very friendly. I didn't have to wait too long for the food, the side salad had amazing croutons. I ordered the prime rib, and it was delicious, as were the fries. Would definitely recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Food here is great. My family & I have staycationed at Chaparral Suites for years. But tonight's service experience changed all that. Here for college football championship game. There is essentially ONE server waiting on approx. 15 tables with c. 4 persons per table. It's a madhouse! Shame on manager for not anticipating a crowd on a game night at a place that touts itself as a sportsbar. Cmonman"}
{"text":"Lady Di and I are still looking for the best Sports Bar in Arizona. 4th floor was very surprising. TVs are great, the pizza is amazing. I had the Rebel IPA, delicious!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and are first night there we went up just to grab a bite to eat. What we got was great service and great food at a good deal. We liked it so much that we went for lunch the next day and as the night before excellent. The service was some of the best I have had in a long time and there b.l.t I had for lunch is one of the best I have ever had in a restaurant lot's of bacon. Good job guys next time I am in that part of town I will be coming up for a bite"}
{"text":"The best hidden spot in town. I could ramble on, and on. The food and drinks are bomb. Staff is wonderful, always personable and they all know what they're doing. It's a comfortable, clean atmosphere. I'd recommend it to anyone, personally or professionally."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I caught this place on and off night or the people that are rating it so high have a lower standard for service and food quality than I have.  The décor, as a lot of folks have described, is incredibly outdated.  I'm not one to really comment on décor, but this was really something out of \"That 70's Show\".  The TV's were great(that's where they get the two stars from).  Service?  What service?  I sat down at a table in the bar area and waited for almost 10 minutes for the server to ask if I needed anything.  There were two other tables with guests at the time, so I couldn't understand why it took so long.    After I ordered my glass of wine, I reviewed the menu.  Decided to start simple with the chips and salsa.  I was long finished with my glass of wine and looked around to locate her.  She was at her terminal reading and sending text messages on her phone.  I was able to catch her attention and waved her over and placed my order.    About 10-15 minutes later, chips and salsa came out.  Half of the chips were stuck together and under done.  The salsa was made up of mostly seeds.  Literally, seeds.  For dinner, I ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs.  HORRIBLE!!  Mostly fat.  Almost no meat.  They do get some props for the fries, though.  When it came time for the check, once again, server had disappeared.   Two or three more tables came in, so my urgency to get settled up ramped up.  Since I couldn't get any attention when there were only two other tables besides me, I didn't want to hang around when there were four or five.  I turned around, once again, to see the server texting on her cell phone.  I don't get to Scottsdale often, but if I do come back, I won't be returning to this place.  Lot's better in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hideout... The Fourth Floor Grille is located on the top floor of the Chaparral Suites Resort. You can choose to sit in the restaurant area or go to the bar side. I sit in the restaurant for business meetings but I really like the feel of the bar.  The food is always great I love the Chaparral sandwich and the Scottsdillian Salad with pesto dressing.  The portions are huge! This is the perfect place to get away from the hustle of OT Scottsdale and just relax grab lunch, a beer or catch the game. Parking is always easy as well.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Okay so we spent a week at the Chaparral Suites and this is the restaurant attached to it.  Naturally, we ate there for dinner on the first night...I was shocked by the service and quality of the food in all the best ways.  There are two sides to the restaurant - the bar side and the dinning side.  We spent all our time in the dining side because of our group size, but 1-4/5 people would do just fine in the bar side of things.  There's a menu left in your room at all times so you can order their food as roomservice and here are all the things I tried:  -The Cowboy Club: Amazing variation of a club sandwich that I will have to make at home because it's probably one of the best i've ever had.  -Bbq Chicken Pizza: Shared on the first night, this thing is massive but for 6 people was just the right size (a personal size pizza is about the size of a medium 10 slicer from pizza hut while the full size is as long as the round table we were sitting at).  Highly recommend this one, amazing flavours!  -the 1/2 order Macho Taco done with the breaded fish fillet: unless you can eat a horse I don't recommend doing a full order, these things are huge, but they are so insanely good you have to try at least one!!  I did mine with fries and honey mustard dip.  -Soups:  I did the Gazpacho, the Chicken Tortilla, and the Chicken Noodle...I loved every single one of them.  The chicken noodle was on the menu the day the bf needed it the most and we all had some with garlic toast.  -Garlic bread basket: you get a ton but it's absolutely delicious!  Soft and flavourful, not dry and crunchy.  -Fries: If you get the sweet potato I suggest you ask for the chipotle mayo, if you get the regular they're lightly battered like some fries are and they're great with any dipping sauce.  -Scottsdalian chicken salad: Massive but absolutely delicious!  The pinenuts and pesto sauce just make it work.  And they aren't skimpy on the chicken!  -Onion Petals or Fried Zucchini: I suggest you go for both...seriously...the onion petals were just right on the onion to batter ratio, and the zucchini came as rounds not sticks and the batter was seasoned so they were super delicious and not so juicy they were scalding like you normally get!  -Florentine Cheese Dip: it's like a queso cheese sauce done awesome.  You get enough to share and it's got a huge punch of flavour you just won't get enough of!  -Chicken Tenders: Again not skimpy on the chicken and cooked just right!  Highly recommend with either the bbq or honey mustard sauces.  Done buffalo style they're delicious!  -Rib Eye steak dinner: Great steak, they know how to treat a rib eye cut properly!  The baked potato needed a bit more sour cream but I'm a sour cream addict so it may be just right for normal people ;)  The vegetables that came with the steak were simply impossible not to inhale!  The front of house manager was a hoot the entire time we were there, though we only saw him the first two of the dinners we had in the restaurant proper, and as a treat for their anniversary he had a dessert brought out which was their brownie sundae...not recommended for a single person (unless you skip dinner), it was absolutely delicious and very easy to polish off between the six of us.  The manager also was kind enough to send a bottle of merlot to their room as a surprise, what a nice guy!  We will definitely eat there again even if we're not staying in the hotel next time."}
{"text":"Let's face it - this is a tourist bar. I should not be going here, but needed a drink within walking range. It should be renamed Midwest Sports Grill. All the annoying Chicago types who think they own the town in the winter. They rival the Scottsdale douchebags for annoyingness if that is even a word. The beers are reasaonable at $4 a pop for Bud Light, but the food is very average. It might be good if your a hotel guest and are clueless about the area, but that's about all. The corned beef in the rueben is of sliced deli variety and that just leaves the whole sandwich at average to below average. I suppose they can say they have good, beer battered fries, but that is not something that wins awards."}
{"text":"The food was really quite good at this hotel restaurant/bar. The service tended to be on the slower side so eating here during lunch breaks from a corporate meeting wasn't an option, but we ate here for dinner several times throughout the week we stayed at Chaparral Suites.   I like that they had room charge set up, especially since the food was billed to the company card :)"}
{"text":"This place definitely is a favorite for me and have been going there for the last 5 years everytime family comes into town. this is the perfect spot for large gatherings without a bunch of noise or crowding! It doesn't look all that nice walking in but once you're seated, you feel right at home!! Excellent wait staff and the same hilarious manager has personally checked on our table every time, great sevice. They have a pretty small menu, but are always willing to go above and beyond and have good food so it works out! Overall a great place to take the family!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are great! Love the atmosphere...and the service is wonderful!! Our Waitress was Roberta and she did a great job helping us decide menu items and catering to my gluten free needs. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chaparral salad.  I had it twice this weekend.  Sports bar is fun an lively and everything is as good as it gets....  We happen to be staying downstairs,  but I would drive to this place.  I wish we were staying longer to enjoy the Friday night fish fry :)"}
{"text":"Check this place out for their Reuben and Onion Petals...EXCELLENT. The fact they have MULTIPLE HD screens tuned in to the World Series and the OU vs ND game is irrelvalent. GREAT, FUN CROWD !!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the most unassuming location - in the back of Chapparral Suites  Went in at 8:55 PM on Mother's day with my fiance and my grandparents who were visiting and staying at Chapparall suites.  The restaurant closes at 9, so i figured they would be rude and try to rush us out.  However, the exact opposite happened.  David, the manager, waited on us and made us feel very welcome.    My grandma is one of the most annoying people to wait on, but David was courteous, answered all of her questions, and she was able to order exactly what she wanted.  I asked for a hamburger, but instead of a beef hamburger, for a piece of salmon - which was not on the menu.  But David obliged and it was a delicious salmon burger with a very nice side salad for like 10 bucks.  My fiance' and grandma had the portobello melts which were pretty awesome for what they are - they came with grilled onions on them and almost tasted like a real hamburger.  My grandpa had veggie quesadallia which was a huge freakin portion and loaded with veges and cheese.  I will be back here due to the service, quantity of food, taste of food, vegetarian options, and price of food.  I suggest you try it.  It also is nicer inside than one would expect."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Scottsdale for the July 4th weekend and found this sports bar for lunch one day.  It's a bit hidden inside a hotel and odd to find (up an elevator, past many hotel rooms) but all was good.  There were many TVs to watch sporting events; I bet it's great on a Sunday during football season.  Food served was typical of a sports bar and was just fine. Everything was what was expected. The service was good."}
{"text":"Great serving sizes - I had the Mac & cheese, and it was amazing! Pepper jack cheese sauce and cavatappi - SO GOOD! I didn't even have room to finish the amazing looking corn bread that accompanied the bowl of mac. The prices were reasonable, and the service was decent as well. Don't know that I would go back - they didn't knock my socks off or anything, but damn that mac & cheese was good!"}
{"text":"Had the \"Blue Burger\". Very nicely cooked, lots of cheese, onions and mushrooms. The bun was quite large, the only true negative about this burger: So much bread. The fries were crisp and delicious. Server Matthew was very polite, knowledgeable of the menu and a comfortable host. Both affordable and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars not because the food was like, the best (it was 4 star), but because it blew my expectations away.  My girlfriend and I came to stay at this hotel for her high school reunion, and decided we should eat beforehand. It was 122 degrees outside and my skin was catching fire, so we ran in to the hotel restaurant for a bite before I expired.   Service was super friendly, place was clean and well-organized, and the booths were comfy and classy. I ordered the macho tacos and asked \"How macho are they?\" and the server said \"Pretty macho' and hell yeah he was right. Two large flour tortillas with cabbage, pico de gallo, some sauce, and sides of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. I got one with pork and one with fish. The pork was pretty decent, but holy crap the fish taco was delicious. Breaded perfectly, a large, tasty portion - I was blown away at how good it was.  My girlfriend got some turkey, bacon, and bleu cheese salad that she was raving about all day. It was a gigantic portion, too.   When I first looked at the menu, I thought the prices were fairly average, but with the quantity and quality of food in this place, it's a definite hidden gem. I would absolutely eat here if I lived in the area and not even stay at the hotel. Definitely not what we expected from a hotel restaurant. I was really impressed."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed!  In any case, naturally I ordered a burger since I gather its sports bar and all.  The Arizona burger was actually pretty good and the portions were fair.  I generally order a medium done and they hit the spot.  Love the steak fries that came along with it!  Overall food was real good.  Ambience is my problem; I gathered it was for patrons of the hotel.  However, what kind of patrons; I don't know.  The place seemed outdated and very conservative.  Yawn!  Sports bar?  Did anybody catch that play on the old CRT TV screen....haha okay that was a joke, they had LCDs.  Point being it was a quiet night I attended and since our group was pretty large we sat in the \"bridge\" room I call it.  Since it connected to the next building.  Needless to say too quiet for my taste.  However, service was good.  The food came quick and the waitress was extra careful and sensitive to our time.  Kudos!  Overall, if they can just bump it up a notch to make things more exciting this place was be fine. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Yes, I am a local, and live down the street.  Probably affects my excitement a little.   The bartender Jon will remember your name, and he greets all the people that come in and sit at the bar.   He puts his hand out and introduces himself!! Not just a 'what can I get you?'   This peson alone has made me a regular.  I feel like NORM!!! when I walk in!  How cool is that.  You too can have this feeling after just a few visits.  I have noticed other regulars, like Stuart and Sam.  Everybody knows and likes the bartender Jon and comes back.   The mac and cheese on the menu has a zesty bite to it.  very cheesy!  Something you will order again!   You can make many new 'friends' passing through town at this place.  Just depends on your personality.  The gentleman that commented about the 'bridge' area being quiet, is correct.  It is set to far away from the bar.  I think they just added tables to a walkway because they could.  Find a seat in the bar for a nice time."}
{"text":"Good food. Much better than your standard pub grub. The garlic bread is especially awesome. Nice wait staff and a few TVs to watch."}
{"text":"Yummy is my description. Love coming here to watch football. Today it's futbol. (Soccer)  Food is really good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we found this hidden gem in Scottsdale.  It's located on the 4th floor in the back of the Chaparral Suites Hotel.  When we were walking towards the restaurant, we thought it might be a disaster of a place but we were pleasantly surprised.  Here's what we ordered over several visits:  Florentine Dip http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4th-floor-grille-and-sports-bar-scottsdale-2?select=DQmZq13xUN-ra3zvVjmoKg#DQmZq13xUN-ra3zvVjmoKg  Baby Back Ribs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4th-floor-grille-and-sports-bar-scottsdale-2?select=Z6Fhf1gkRQaZ3Jk0u2ESGA#Z6Fhf1gkRQaZ3Jk0u2ESGA  Western Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4th-floor-grille-and-sports-bar-scottsdale-2?select=jferQYYFaJ0Sq411lksDdA#jferQYYFaJ0Sq411lksDdA  Ribeye http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4th-floor-grille-and-sports-bar-scottsdale-2?select=F55s06-FF8ERfsfJtjFgkw#F55s06-FF8ERfsfJtjFgkw  French Dip Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4th-floor-grille-and-sports-bar-scottsdale-2?select=V30yOHNPj2GB3BJGIMqs4w#V30yOHNPj2GB3BJGIMqs4w  The Baby Back Ribs, Western Burger, and French Dip Sandwich were awesome.  The Ribeye was very good too....and the Florentine Dip was amazing/addicting.  Soooo good!  The Wine selection is basic, go for the Beer or Spirits here.  The servers are friendly and attentive.  Overall, a nice spot.  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"Came for the fish tacos, did not get to eat fish tacos. Apparently they can only be ordered at the bar during happy hour and \"since they aren't on the normal menu, we can't make them\". What?! You have them on your happy hour bar menu and are fully capable of making them throughout the day if you already have everything you need to make a fish taco ready to go in the kitchen. I ended up getting the chicken apple walnut salad which wasn't bad but the apples were mushy and had no taste."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Almost empty; staff is nice. We ordered the meat lover pizza! Big enough for two hungry guys!"}
{"text":"We visited our family who was staying here and ate lunch with them at the 4th Floor Grill. We had a large group and the waitress was helpful and got all of our orders correct.  I'm writing this review with 5 stars for the sweet potatoe fries and Mac and Cheese. It was a delicious plate of creamy Mac and Cheese with a kick! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Solid menu for a hotel restaurant with great fresh selections and good portions for the price.  Good for lunch, the bar area has comfortable seating and several TVs to watch games."}
{"text":"Um, okay. Another interesting experience with my coupon-collecting pal. So, picture yourself in the middle of 55 and over section of Scottsdale, on the fourth floor of some hotel. There are conferences and trainings going on in some large room on site.I was told the guests fill the place at times.  So you wander into the bar and what do you find? 55 and over. Now, I always say how great it is to be the youngest in the room, right? I am talking by 40-50 years. I am sure the place gets \"crazy\" when the lottery numbers are announced. Otherwise, though, it seemed none of the peeps there was paying attention to the games on the multiple TVs, A few even brought in their own alcohol, SWEAR TO GOD. I guess a free place to sit and meet with friends without spending your pension? One guy about sat on my friends lap, she kept inching over towards me. We took pictures to prove this and they remain funny as heck. As for the food, we ordered some wings (all drums) which were really not so bad. It was the legs rubbing against ours that sent us packing. The stars are for the bartender. He rocked."}
{"text":"So I had family in town and they stayed at this hotel.  I had no idea that this place existed. I didn't even want to go eat here.  Really?  Some hotel?    Uh... best burger ever.  Seriously.  The bar area was packed to the gills so we went over to the restaurant side.  The menu consists of sandwiches, some entrees, your basic fare.  Then I happened to look at a burger being served to the table next to us.  Holy crap.  We each got one of the burgers. I got the Phoenix Burger and my relatives got a variety as well.  These are handmade, huge, juicy but not overly greasy. the grilled onions were delicoius, the buns were toasted, and the fries were fantastic.    I coulnd't finish mine it was so huge.    Who knew this random hotel has a fantastic grille/bar?"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect, but glad I didn't have high hopes as it was average at best. .     Came here around 6pm and it was dead.  Aside from a few people in the bar area watching the game we were the only party in the dining room.    Service was ok. Waitress was friendly, but they were terribly slow (not sure why as there weren't other guest). It took about 10 minutes to even get water and put our drink order in after we were seated. Not sure if she was the only one working the entire place between the few in the bar room and us in the dining room.  Seems she did her best.   Now for the food and the real reason for the rating.  I ordered the Sport Club sandwich. It was ok. Just your typical ham and turkey on toasted wheat bread.  Slightly greasy which was odd.  Nothing special. A few in our party ordered the Apple Walnut Salad.  This was highly disappointing.  Unfortunately expecting fresh crisp apple slices would have been too much to ask as the slices had the consistency of soggy pears. Had to be canned slices, or they just committed a hate crime against a regular apple. This was the same for both salads Rest of salad was bland and equally a let down.    The entrees were highly over priced ranging from $12-$27 but with quality that should have ranged $7-$12.  Guess now it was obvious why we were the only ones in there."}
{"text":"Monday night at 9:00 they had \"reverse happy hour\" which meant cheap drinks and a cheap limited menu. Barkeep was VERY busy but attentive and nachos were decent."}
{"text":"Most unremarkable below average place I could imagine.  80's decor, flat soda, bland food (burger, chicken tenders, Chaparral sandwich), slightly high (but not preposterously so) prices, blah service. Really just quite a depressing sort of one notch above Denny's establishment.  Two stars are for the friendly and personable manager who was the only bright spot in the joint. Hope he finds a better gig soon."}
{"text":"We've stayed at The Chaparral many times and never eaten here.... Except the kids have had room service in the past.  Found out this visit that we've been missing out. The 4th Floor has great food and great service. Our server Debbie was friendly, helpful, knew the menu well and made good suggestions. Another gentleman kept our drink glasses full. Highlights for us.... Wings, fish tacos, burger, sweet potato fries.... Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The gay waiter with the glasses was kind of an aloof dick, but hey, I get it... We can't all be fabulous at our day jobs.  He was courteous to our table of 50+ patrons and the blue cheese burger was pretty fantastic.  The night staff manager woman is awesome and was willing to deal with me in all my annoyed self when I ordered drinks.  The signs say that service ends at midnight, but the security staff was escorting people to the bar as late as 12:15, so there must be some leeway...  All the TVs were suspiciously silent for this being a sports bar, another plus...  I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! They accommodated us and turned the tv to UFC on Fox even though they normally don't show fights. We ate and had a few drinks and had an awesome time! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can find the words to describe how much this place exceeded any expectations I had walking in. I ate here twice for lunch during a business trip. The first time out of convenience and the second time because the first visit was so good.   Between the two visits I tried: A small house salad which was fresh, served on a chilled plate and had homemade blue cheese dressing.  A turkey club which had guacamole, chipotle mayo, bacon, pepper jack cheese, plenty of good quality turkey on toasted 9-grain bread.  A burger on a butter-toasted bun with my choice of guacamole,carmelized onions and bacon. It was clearly not a frozen patty and was cooked perfectly medium and juicy.   Everything I ate was of very good quality, tasty and was matched with prompt and friendly service. I would come eat here even if I weren't staying at the hotel property!"}
