{"text":"Great food. Amazing service. And the best gluten free, vegan bhajji's in the WORLD! Call ahead to get most of the food they serve freshly prepared and packaged for takeout. LOVE THIS PLACE.  Honestly everything here is so delicious"}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!  DO NOT EAT OR ORDER FROM HERE.  We ordered from here off Just-eat.ca and what a shit show. We ordered a small tandoori chicken and they called to tell me that it doesn't come in small so I said we'll take the large or whatever size they had. We also ordered a small butter chicken and some rice and naan. It took an hour and a half before our food came, only to find that there was no tandoori chicken, a samosa (which we did not order) and the food was cold. Looked at the bill and it showed that we were charged for the tandoori chicken. I called the restaurant and there was no answer.   So I called just-eat and they got a hold of them and the guy (Joseph) on the phone tried to explain that instead of giving us tandoori they gave us a medium butter chicken (instead of small) and a samosa to account for the missing tandoori... unbelievable! Seeing that the price of the tandoori was not equal to upsizing the butter chicken and we didn't want a samosa, I demanded that I wanted a refund for the tandoori and he argued with me. I threatened to write this review and he agreed to give me the refund which I have a feeling I will never actually see.  On top of this, later in the evening just after we go to bed my girlfriend is hit with a wave of nausea... Yep, food poisoned from the indian food we got at this place. We ended up calling 911 because of how violent the illness got and the paramedics came and treated her. She is ok now, but wow, amazing what damage ordering from this hell hole can cause. Be warned!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some lunch here with a friend .... Counter service style curries. Butter chicken was very tender and tasty. Service was friendly. Only downfall garlic Naan was microwaved. Would definitely return for some butter chicken while on the go!"}
{"text":"The minute I walked in I was greeted with great enthusiasm and was told to not hesitate to ask for a sample.  As I browsed their menu and looked at each dish (dishes were pre-made), I was also given  a breakdown of their specials. After much consideration I decided to get their combo with rice, butter chicken and lamb curry for $8.99.  In addition I ordered a samosa for .75 cents,  a naan with butter for $1.29 and a mango lassi for $1.49. I had been on the fence about the lentils and ultimately decided to hold off and try them another time. I guess I must have looked really sad by my decision that I was offered some to take home for free. Now that is service!  So this is what I thought....  Service  Great! My questions were answered with genuine kindness, and I was offered the opportunity to try any dish I wanted. I was also given a brief tour and encouraged to let them know if there is a dish I would like to eat but it is currently not on their menu. They seemed eager to please and accommodate their patrons.  Sitting  There is no sitting except for the table and 2 chairs situated outside. It's really a take-out establishment rather than a restaurant.  Packaging  Not a fan, but then again I can't come up with an alternative option. I really do not like it when my food mixes together, but when it comes to Indian food it is best to mix the food anyway.  Naan  It was too tough to eat. It was soft when I first unwrapped it from the foil, but once it cooled down it became too tough to eat. This was really disappointing since I am normally a fan of naan and to see it go to waste was a shame.  Butter Chicken  It was creamy, sweet and more importantly the chicken was tender. No complaints.  Lamb Curry  It was tender but not spicy enough for me. It really needed a kick. Sadly the butter chicken overpowered the lamb. When does that ever happen?  Lentils  It was good. Though I felt that it needed a kick of something to make it great.  Samosa  Nice and crispy. A bit smaller than what I am used to (I usually buy 3 samosas from a corner store on Bay and Wellesley for $2-3 for $2), but it was still tasty. Oh how I miss the Scarborough prices. I remember buying 6 samosas for $1.  Mango Lassi  Favorite part of the meal. It really did taste like you were drinking a shake made with fresh mangoes and milk/yogurt. I am not sure if they used milk or yogurt. But whatever they used, it was delicious. The only downfall was the container it came in. I tried to insert the straw on the lid and it just would not let me. In my attempts to stab the straw in the lid I ended up spilling a lot of the mango lassi to my dismay.  I am still not convinced that there was a hole on the lid for me to stick my straw into to begin with.  Overall I did enjoy my meal. It did seem to be on the safe side, but overall there was nothing majorly wrong with each dish except for the inedible naan. Again, remember that I am super-picky when it comes to Indian food. Plus I like my food spicy.  Addendum:  Received a message from Bombay Express asking me to tell my friends and those I know about them.  Yet, they did not offer to at least exchange the naan, or rectify some of the problems with my meal in any way. For an establishment that is trying to get business, I suggest to step-up and correct some of your blatant errors. Until then, I will find another place to order my food from.  One place that comes to mind is King Palace on Church and Yonge which I recently visited. You pay more, but the portions are bigger and you get what you ask for; good food with edible naan."}
