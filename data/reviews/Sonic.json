{"text":"Worst sonic EVER. Received raw chicken here once and have been skeptical about it ever since.  Only go for the milkshakes and haven't been in forever because their not half off anymore.   The signs say \"open until midnight or later\" and the cups say it too which is a lie they're only open until 10. I was excited about sonic when they first built it in the gib but this is the worst one ever."}
