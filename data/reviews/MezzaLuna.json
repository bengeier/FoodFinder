{"text":"As a refugee from the East Coast, I can say that Mezza Luna makes the best NY Style pizza I've had in CU.    Good cheese, tasty sauce and a perfect crust."}
{"text":"I've never met a pizza I didn't like. That being said, MezzaLuna's pie is quite good if you're in the mood for a crust with a bit more dough. We've tried the Chicken Cacciatore and Shrimp Primavera. Both are delicious. Added bonus: they deliver. Check it out."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the pizza, but it is the best hand-tossed/NY-style in town.  They also serve alcohol now, so it's a fully capable restaurant.  Comparable in price to Papadel's and Jupiters.  The lunch buffet is surprisingly high-quality as well."}
{"text":"I've only been to the lunch buffet.  The service is slow, but the pizza is good and the price is right.   Ask them to put in a chicken-bbq pizza for the buffet, they're really good."}
{"text":"Minus one star for not serving alcohol.  Who opens an Italian restaurant without serving wine?!?

Minus another star because the garlic bread is made out of hot dog buns.  The good kind of hot dog buns, granted, but they're still hot dog buns.

Minus another star because of the copious amounts of salt in everything, especially the garlic bread.  I went through three glasses of water during our short meal and was still thirsty.

Minus another because both the lemon in my water and the tomatoes in my salad were green.

Minus another star because we placed our order, received our bread, then our salads, then our entrees (which were supposed to have been be baked ) in under 5 minutes.  So clearly things are being pre-made and reheated, which was also evident in the taste and texture of the food. Yuck.

Minus another star because the marinara tastes like it came out of a jar, only saltier. 

Minus another because, considering the poor quality, the food was pretty expensive.  $12 entrees are more than fair when the food is good, ridiculous when it isn't.

So.... I ran out of stars awhile ago, didn't I?  Guess that means I won't be going back to MezzaLuna any time soon."}
{"text":"Three stars?  Four stars?  It's pretty solid, but they don't serve alcohol and there's no BYOB option.  Write me if that changes, I'll bump to four.

The pizza is good, east coast-style (shut up - my dinner guest hails from Jersey), kinda thin softish crust that you can fold up and the orange grease dribbles out.  I had some good lasagna, which was super-rich, so eat slowly - I could only finish half, it was that huge a serving.  $10.99 gets you just about any entree.  I'm talking about big entrees, with garlic bread and salad included.  Husband enjoyed his calzone.

Really nice guys working last night.  Very casual place."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of coming home one day expecting a home made meal from my mother. Maybe some potato curry? Or even okra curry? I was told my brother had gone to MezzaLuna to get us dinner. 

When he came back, he tossed a box at me. Opening it, I saw a Calzone. Now, I'd never had a Calzone up to this point and didn't quite know what to expect. So when I dipped it in the included tomato sauce and bit into it, I wasn't expecting a flood of oil to overwhelm my mouth. A few more bites later and  I realized my relations with the Calzone weren't improving. I threw it back in it's box and refrigerated it. 

The box sat in the fridge for the next couple of days. Every time I'd open the fridge to contemplate my dinner, I'd first take a look at the box, realize I could improvise something from the fresh, organic, and locally grown vegetables next to it, and reach for them instead. 

Eventually, I tossed the calzone. The thoughts of the flood of oil on my first bite weren't particularly appetizing and thinking about that moment every time I opened the fridge kept my stomach feeling queasy.

Whee. Test test."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Italian food I have ever tasted. No joke. This place is on par with Fazoli's and you pay a lot more, which would in my book make Fazoli's superior. At any rate, the salads are terrible, the service is really bad, the garlic bread is vomit-inducing, and the entrees are cheese, noodle, and marinara sauce. Way to not try or be innovative in any way."}
{"text":"I had only been to Mezze Luna at lunchtime, and wasn't particularly enthused at the suggestion to go there for dinner tonight with friends, but was up for something--anything--different than what we usually do.

That being said, Mezze Luna was a fantastic surprise.  To the reviewers talking about no alcohol, you'll be happy to know that they now serve.  I had questions about a couple of the Italian wine varieties, and they brought me tastes of the wines so I could decide.

I had the cannelloni and it was FABULOUS.  My friend had the chicken parmesan and loved it as well.  The men both had pasta with meat sauce and raved.  The toasted ravioli appetizer and garlic cheese bread was awesome, and the house balsamic viniagrette was terrific on the fresh salad with wonderfully soft and tasty fresh mozzerella cheese.

I wasn't expecting much at all, but was VERY pleased with our find this evening.  We will be back!  :)"}
