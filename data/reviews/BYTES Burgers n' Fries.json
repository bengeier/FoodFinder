{"text":"Late entry, but Overall: 4.5 stars..

Food:
Delicious burgers, gravy and fries. I had the kilobyte burger (aka cheeseburger). Burger was notable for its soft sesame seed bun, fresh toppings and also their special sauce. Food is fresh and made to order. I enjoyed the food here thoroughly. I would much prefer coming to this restaurant over the fast food chains across the street. The fries were hot and the oil used to fry wasn't old either. Personally I thought the seasoning made the fries slightly on the salty side. I haven't tried other menu items, but the first experience was good enough that I'll be back. 

Service:
This has a home style feel to it. Reminds me of when I was in high school and went to the local family owned burger joint. The server and cook were both friendly and very helpful with the menu. I personally have a soft spot for independent chain restaurants! 

Parking:
Tricky to get into the plaza if you're driving north on Bayview or east on Major Mackenzie. I had to turn around to southbound Bayview to get into the plaza. Parking was easy though once I got in. It's a bit limited though, so I'd keep that in mind during busy hours. 

Overall:
Delicious burgers, great atmosphere and home feel. I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up and I have to say it was quite pretty darn good. Got the kilobyte burger, byte size spicy poutine, and chicken souvlaki for the cost of around $20.  Pretty cheap considering the size of each dish. The burger and souvlaki comes with an abundant amount of toppings and the byte size poutine is huge!  In regards to their poutine I got the spicy special that included bell peppers and 2 onion rings on top of an over flowing amount of fries and honestly even though I love spice, I would recommend the regular poutine.  The bell pepper marinade takes away from the taste of the gravy and cheese which I consider the whole point of getting a poutine! It was still very delicious as was everything else but I think it would be even better without the spice addition.  For the burger though, the bell peppers added a nice kick to an already delicious package. As I have stated many times already, portions were large, I could barely finish the burger and poutine. So far my favourite burger joint to date."}
{"text":"It's okay, nothing special though - just a regular franchise fry joint with a 'digital' gimmick to the names of the items on the menu.  The frozen meat in the burger was very salty and the toppings (pickle, tomato, peppers) had no flavour at all.  There is way too much bun for the burger as well, and I had their 'gigabyte' size which is the 2nd largest I believe at 1/3 lb, and I had easily 2 to 3 large bites of just bun remaining.  The staff is very friendly and eager to please, and the restaurant appears clean.  The pricing is reasonable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I were hungry and in the area, I might try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Tried this on a quiet evening because it had great reviews. We had the cheeseburger, chicken strips, and fish and chips, with poutine and onion rings for sides. The fish was very odd and not traditional fish batter - some spices and a lot of breading. Some might like it, but it wasn't for me. The hamburger was too greasy and tasted like sausages. The poutine was ok and edible, but nothing special. Onion rings were over fried. Making up for the food, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I like supporting a small local business but I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place. Their veggie burgers and fries are to die for. Chris is a lovely gentleman who runs the business - it's family owned. The woman who puts the toppings on the burger is so precise and clean. Even the son is very kind. Overall, great food and customer service."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a burger because I was hungry and in the area. This place is right across from a high school so it does get super busy at various times throughout the day.

I ordered the 1/3 lb burger. I didn't really pay attention to what they slapped on the grill, but I'm assuming this was a frozen burger patty. If this was a made in-house burger patty, I would be shocked. Shocked. The patty was very finely ground, had almost no discernible beef flavour, and had that spongy texture of binders. 

Why would I give a frozen burger three stars? Nostalgia, dude. This burger reminded me of a Lick's burger. Not Lick's in its awesome made in-house heyday, but Lick's in its mass-marketed frozen patty stage. I got some special sauce and garlicky pickles on my burger and it totally tasted like a Lick's Homeburger with Guk sauce. Despite the frozen, bland patty, it hit the spot.

Aside from the nostalgia factor, the bun was really good. Soft and squishy. And the service was very friendly.

I suppose serving frozen burgers to teenagers is a pretty good business model, but true burger aficionados are not going to drive out of their way for a frozen patty. Unless they're really missing Lick's."}
{"text":"Before I get to anything else about this restaurant I have to give a huge shout out to the staff here. From the moment we walked through the door they were friendly, inviting, and helpful. And the whole time we were there they did everything they could to make the visit a great one. They even thanked us for coming out and giving them a try. 
And the place was nice and clean. The restaurant itself was immaculate. And even the bathroom appeared regularly tended to - along with nice polite signs posted to let people know how to behave in them. 
I liked the food too. We had a souvlaki wrap, the 1/3 lb cheeseburger, fries, and drinks. I only had a bite of the souvlaki, but it was amazing. I honestly think this is what I'm going to get next time! The burger was good, but I wouldn't call it great. Good size, and tasty, but the bun was a little wrong for the burger (a larger bakery bun that didn't give too well to the teeth, so biting it tended to squeeze all the toppings out of the burger), and it was a little short on toppings. Lots of sauces to make it messy, but I had asked for extra extra tomato, and got two small slices. 
Fries were just everyday frozen Crispy Coated ones. Cooked well enough, but I'm always a fan of having fresh made fries. Especially in a place that talked about making a lot of the other things themselves. 
With great staff, a nice place, and some pretty good food choices, we're already making plans to go back."}
{"text":"I usually go and eat at the places recommended by yelp but this is the first time that I ever posted a review. This just shows how great the food here is. There's really nothing else to say."}
{"text":"One of the workers like to keep pointing out 'ladies first' when it's time to choosing toppings. I understand chivalry is polite but it kind of came off creepy. Especially when I wasn't even there to choose any of my toppings yet."}
{"text":"I have never posted before but this place is the epitome of a small town burger joint done to perfection.  Great friendly staff,  good burgers and selection of canned drinks for combo, cajun fries.  Their terabyte burger is Wendy's triple baconator should be x10.  Get the special T sauce. For normal people a mega or gigabyte burger will hit the spot. They also do soft serve ice cream with cutely named candies like gummy glitches and pink pixels.  I just watched the staff kindly sit down with a barrier free customer to deck out their burger!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try out this place and as you can tell from the rating I loved it ! I loved it the minute I walked in. The owner is super friendly and nice and there fries are the best fries I've ever had in my entire life and I hate fries. They're so crunchy and soft and inside it was amazing. their burgers were very good. And I got a combo with bacon cheese for $10. Megabyte burger was amazing. I loved it here. Definite would go back! On an empty stomach of course. Also if you go on weekdays around 11:30-12:30 a lot of kids because of the schools around so beware 10/10"}
{"text":"The owner, Chris, is a very nice guy. The food is fantastic delicious, I love home made fries they made! If you tries with McDonald's , you should give it a try! You gonna love it. You won't believe the burger taste so good , you have a lot of choices on the topics. I order the bites burger and I come back again in the same week! However, they closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Richmond Hill , Ontario  . So clean, friendly and delicious food ever. I recommend to everybody try it , excellent Burger so yummy yummy"}
{"text":"The positive reviews are for REAL. I put this place as my go to burger and fries place if I'm not feeling McDonald's or Wendy's. Sorry hero burger.. Similar price but more value and taste.

They stayed open for our order on a  Friday night. Very friendly staff and clean establishment. I can't remember the name but I ordered the bacon cheeseburger meal. The fries are Costco style fries with the bit of crispy coating. My friend got the poutine and it was quite good for a non smokes poutine. Fresh toppings to choose from and the bytes sauce is great! It's similar to big Mac sauce.

I can't recommend this place enough. I've been making excuses to return here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I get the same thing every time because of how great the food is. She gets a Byte burger with onion rings and I grab a Byte Burger and fries with gravy on the side. The staff at Bytes Burgers are extremely polite AND they serve fantastic food as well. The prices are more than fair and you pay for a quality product from great people. The burgers are made fresh from scratch and they take some time to prepare. Nothing sits under heat lamps and you're served a juicy hamburger that was MADE TO ORDER. You can tell they know their stuff because they are organized, clean and time the cooking perfectly. Have you ever been told that your food takes 10 minutes to cook and then you have your fries sitting on the counter going cold? Not here! Chris, always makes sure that you get your food hot and fresh. The second time we came back, we ordered on the phone ahead of time and everything was made to spec. Chris even took the time to pack them in seperate brown paper bags labelled \"His\" and \"hers\". Just goes to show you how they are willing to go above and beyond expectations. I'm sure they understand that you can't eat burgers and french fries every week but when my girlfriend and I do come here, we know we are in for treat. You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and great service.  The burger is a probably.from a frozen patty and not freshly made like other burger joints around the area.  The fries were great but for a independent burger joint, I was hoping that it would be a freshly made burger not from a frozen patty.  It does satisfy a quick fix if you are in the area, but drive a few blocks north, South or west you can get better burgers."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday afternoon, way passed the hour of the school across the street so it wasn't busy at all. 

I ordered the fish and chips and my boyfriend got the chicken souvlaki on a pita.

The fish was okay, the batter on it was quite thick. As for the fish itself it was very flakey, not sure if it was fresh or frozen. But the fries they put their own seasoning on them and it was finger licking good! Also their homemade tartar sauce is one of the best I've ever had!!! 

The chicken souvlaki was pretty good, the chicken was still moist and flavourful. The tzatziki sauce was okay, I didn't think it was as flavourful as opa. But than again I only had a byte (pun intended hahaha)

Overall it was a good experience, I'd come again for lunch. And I do know the owner does read reviews! A young lady walked in and he thanked her for the review she wrote."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, very juicy patty with fresh toppings and the bun is lightly toasted which is a nice touch. The chef was also friendly and cooked the burger how I wanted. For the price you pay and the portion you get you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great burger place. Tons of ways to customize your burger, the fries are to die for and the prices are reasonable. I've been there twice now and will definitely be returning. Customer service is also great they make you feel at home. Small tip: go there from 12-1 as it is next to the highschool and can get busy outside of that time frame during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for group outings, a (relatively) quick bite, comfort food, decadence, etc.

The staff and service are among the most hospitable I've seen in a while. The chef, especially, is a masterful cooker.

Their burgers come in different sizes. I recommend the Megabyte or Gigabyte burgers, or the Terabyte if you're feeling ambitious. Crunchy fries, rich in flavour. The poutine is quite good too, but perhaps a bit too cheesy (literally).

If you're a student at Bayview, you NEED to try Bytes out. The diner setting is a welcome change to the bubble tea and fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"I had the juiciest burger I've had in a long time here! The bun to meat ratio was perfect. The bun was nice and fresh. Great selection of toppings for the burgers! Menu has a lot of things to choose from as well! Get a combo! It's great value for your money! I tried some soft serve as well...it looked so good and I couldn't resist all the toppings to choose from! Definitely checking this place out again! Did I mention the friendly staff! Although they just opened, they seemed to know what they were doing!"}
{"text":"Clean,  decent, and  food not bad for fast food joint . But abit pricey. I Still recommended"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, delicious food while being served with perfect customer service, look no further! BYTES is a small family owned shop that serves burgers, fries and lots of greek infusion dishes. 

I always come here for their crispy fries with just the right amount of seasoning. There must be some secret seasoning they use because I simply cannot get enough of it! If you're craving a burger, be sure to try some of their crazy burgers with 2 or 3 patties. 

When the owners serve the burgers they have an array of toppings and condiments you can apply to your burger. You HAVE TO ask for the BYTES sauce because it adds so much to every bite you take. 

Overall, the customer service is what differentiates BYTES from other competitors. As a student, it is hard to feel welcomed into a restaurant but here, the employees care a lot for what all their customers have to say. Props to you guys!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken souvlaki sandwich. Been in many places for chicken souvlaki including G.T.G. 
Taste was like very homemade and better than GTG. Recommened those look for less salty chicken souvlaki."}
{"text":"We were looking for burgers in this area that weren't franchise chains. 

Nice, simple burger joint with fresh ingredients and delicious buns! Price is great for the amazing quality of food you get. The fries were perfectly made and perfectly crisp and golden. 

Staff are really nice and friendly. 

would totally come back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch! It was pretty empty when I arrived and we were able to order right away, there was almost nobody in this restaurant. However, it did take them a while for them to prepare our order, maybe this is because we were there before the rush. This place had a great, clean interior and really nice staff. Their menu is really cute as the naming of the burgers follow the metric naming system for bytes. Like their burgers are named byte burger, kilobyte burger, megabyte burger, etc.

The fries were really good, and they seemed really fresh and a bit crispy on the outside which is how I like my fries. The burger patty was a bit dry and felt too thick, too compressed, I think it was slightly overcooked, besides that the rest of the burger was pretty good. It was pretty greasy and it tasted a bit more bland than other great burger places I've had. I had the megabyte burger which came with bacon and cheese.

The nice thing about this place is they have a lot of free toppings you can add to your burger and home-made sauces you can add on your burger."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and the boss (I think?) was the only person there and was very courteous and friendly.  I wonder if the boss was a former computer guy as the burgers are named after bits, bytes, mega and giga.  Lol.

We picked up a burger, poutine and fish & chips.  It was pretty good and I would go back anytime since it's so close to my place and a great, quick  burger option.  Plus supporting a local small business as well (the last two restaurants in that location shut down...boo)."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in the area. Great quaility ingredients and some of the best fries i have ever had. You gotta eat here"}
{"text":"The burger and fries at Bytes are really good, and the service is great. The owner was very informative, and the staff was polite and accommodating. They have a vast selection of toppings you can add to your burger, and these days when restaurants seem to be charging a premium for everything, it was a welcome change. My only wish was that the burger wasn't frozen, and was formed fresh in-house. You can honestly taste the difference between frozen and home-made instantly, but nonetheless, it was still a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Really good spot if you want a quick \"byte\", get it? Food overall was delicious. I got the chicken soulvaki pita. Usually from other places, the chicken is dry, however very juicy here! Instead of fries i decided to get the salad, which was very good as well, only critic i have about it was the sauce which was a little bland.

Food also came fairly quick too! 5/5 service and taste."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in the neighbourhood randomly. The bun is really good, although the patties were very juicy. The guys working are really nice. It's better than your average fast food burger for about the same price. They also have a home made byte sauce, and all the fries are Cajun fries. Really good portions for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Bytes Burgers just opened up a few weeks ago and I was washing my truck and got hungry. Decided to head over to the new place and try out a burger. I got the 1/3 lb GiG w/ cheese and was disappointed that my first bite was that taste of distinctly highly processed frozen patty. Bread and toppings were great. Reminded me a bit of Harvey's and I know they use a ton of filler in there meat. I hope there will be a homemade option even if it's a limited time offer. Gordon Ramsey would not approve of the current menu, however, if you have kids, I'm sure they would love it."}
