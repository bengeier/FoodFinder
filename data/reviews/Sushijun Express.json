{"text":"Love the bento boxes for lunch. Only a few tables so can be hard to get a table. Order ahead for takeout! Great prices for what you get"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi. Very fresh and well executed. You can tell the chefs are very experienced. The service is great, very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend the spider role and dynamite role."}
{"text":"Neat place off of Dixie and Courtney Park.  Small restaurant with a modern decor and very limited seating.  If you have a party 4 or more... call ahead to reserve seating. You can order ahead for takeout.  Place seems very busy during lunch hr.  I am told by my sister who is a regular that it is only open Monday-Friday for lunch time only.  The food here is surprising very good.  From their bento boxes, udon soups or rolls.  Fresh and portions are generous.  Staff is friendly and remember their regulars orders."}
