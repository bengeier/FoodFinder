{"text":"Lobster bisque taste like water and very pricy for the plate entree portion. I don't even want to waste my time to talk about the dessert and the tea. The table is dirty and the cups have lipsticks on!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my recent visit for their 3rd anniversary 2 meal for the price of $19.99 available daily after 6pm. They have about 6 entr√©es chooses from the menu ranges from lamb chop, rib eye, lobster salad, lobster pasta, etc.. We ordered the lamb chop and lobster pasta. the quality of the food is ok but the portions are very small. I need to find more food to eat after the meal. The meal comes with a soup or salad. Good value and great for small eaters."}
{"text":"Went there last week during the buy 1 get one free promotion, and there was a long line up for the restaurant. The food was not bad for the price, $20 for two people, but the portion sizes were small. Lobster bisque was watered down, but clam chowder was better. Had the steak, it was decent for the price. If they could include a drink it would be better."}
{"text":"Came here because I've noticed the restaurant advertising a lot of promotions making the place more affordable then it used to be. When I entered and looked at the menu I noticed a substantial dissonance between the restaurant decor and the actual menu. The decor looks like a typical run down and affordable Hk style cafe, while the menu sounds like a pricier HK style cafe on par with Dickens Cafe or something. I was surprised to see really Western items like Chicken Cacciatore which isn't common at all at the typical HK style Cafe. That being said, for westerners ordering these familiar sounding, seemingly Western items, please do not have the expectation that the food will be what you expect. In fact you should expect it to be a Hong Kong interpretation of the dish.  Now with the food, it was generally pretty medicore! I was surprised that the soup that came with my meal wasn't the typical boring white soup with a few pieces of corn floating in it. Definitely a plus to get REAL soup for once at a HK cafe. However it went a bit downhill when I got my pasta dish with chicken. The chicken was poorly seasoned and so was the pasta sauce. However despite this disappointment I would like to come back for their dinner special (2 can dine for $20), since I saw that they had a lot of steak/ seafood dishes which would make the promotion an extremely good deal. Overall though, this is only a mediocre place for lunch. If I wanted to go to a cheap HK cafe, I have Sugar Sweet Cafe, if I wanted something more expensive, I have Dickens. So really not much reason to come here except for that dinner promotion. Hope it hasn't ended yet though!"}
{"text":"\"Um....?\" Take note if your ordering beef: It's not beef at all. It's basicly just some kind of meat. Proof: Look at the size! I like how the beef has vechables on the side, and most other food.  Bread, and salad for the start is nice. There are (2) soup for the start too, but I try avoid ordering them as much as I can."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and the food was surprisingly good.  I ordered the smoke salmon and chicken pasta with white wine while my boyfriend ordered the baked Portuguese chicken.  My dish was not worth $10 because I was given little smoke salmon and only two small pieces of chicken. It was mostly pasta.  Their baked Portuguese chicken was really delicious.  I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to trying their dinner menu some time in the future because their selection looks good and cheap."}
{"text":"Well this place is interesting.  I thought having 2 dinners for one price was too good to be true. Nope! Less than $20 before tax can fill two stomachs on a weekday. The food itself is more than the price's worth as well!  The soups are Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque, as Jennifer mentioned already. The Clam Chowder is delicious, and my dad says the Lobster Bisque is just as good, so you can't go wrong with both.  My favourite is the seafood pasta (well, because I love seafood!). My dad took the sirloin steak. We had some of each others dishes, and they were both equally as good.  The iced lemon tea is acceptable, but I've been to better places."}
{"text":"The food is just mediocre, although their promo prices are pretty good $19 for 2 entrees. Pasta is bland and no better than what I could do at home. Lobster bisque was okay, just watery and lacking. Mixed Seafood dish is skimpy on the sea part, way too much pasta. I unfortunately ordered the $3.99 coffee and dessert add on, and the coffee was terrible and tastes like day old. Random dessert was offered, no idea what it is but it was made of egg white and sugar.   2 stars for a mediocre seafood meal for $13.99.  1star if I had to pay full price of $23.99.   This is a place for a cheap meal to make you feel rich and enjoying 90's pop hit cover artists."}
{"text":"Used to be my family's canteen 2 yrs ago, but we stop going cause the food quality is getting bad.  Been there again during this summer, food is ok but not impressive.  Esp I love their homemade bun very much in the past, but they switched to garlic toast now.  Soups still taste very good, that's the best part I like.  To me other dishes is just so so, but if u like light taste, then this is a place for u."}
{"text":"Right across from World Bowl on Leslie North of Hwy 7.  If you want a place that serve cheap chinese/western food, this is not for you. The price is not rock bottom cheap but with the price you paying, you do get well prepared food with fresh ingredients.  All the main course comes with a choice of soup (Clam Chowder/Lobster Bisque) or Salad. I really like their Clam Chowder, it is on the creamy side (I know a lot of calories) but it is so yummy! And every course do come with 2 piece of garlic bread (that can be a hit or miss, sometimes it is warm and tasty, sometimes can be cold and chewy).  For main course, they have the Monday - Thu special for $10 each, with the choice of grilled sirlion steak, mahi mahi, seafood pasta, tiger shrimps.. Only comes with soup or salad, no dessert.  On weekend they has the 1/2 lobster and steak special for $19.99 which comes with coffee/tea and a dessert when we were there last time.  I really enjoy their mango pudding dessert! It is really tasty with real mango inside.. and for the tea, it is not HK style tea so if that's what you want, you will be disappointed.  I usually order the grilled filet of sole with crab sauce. I found the fish is always fresh and tasty. And of course this main course comes with the dessert!!"}
