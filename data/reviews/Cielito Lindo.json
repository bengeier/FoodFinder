{"text":"The 'atmosphere' is pretty much non-existent, but the food is great and the prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Yummm!  Very good food!   Haven't eaten in always take out. But food is oh so yumm!"}
{"text":"If you want fine-dining, this place isn't for you. But if you're looking for a home cooked taste and feel, you'll love this place.  The owner is a sweetheart and the food is very delicious. Restaurant reminds me of the old authentic Mexican Restaurants we used to have in Toronto (Bloor & Bathurst) before the big chains opened up.  We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Food was original and amazing. Priced well. Give this restaurant...for taste a 5 stars. Just a small mama pa's but amazing food."}
{"text":"Eating my taco salad made me feel like I was in a college dorm eating refried beans from a can. I felt like I was eating the cheapest of ingredients here.  Yuck."}
{"text":"So I found this place years ago while coming back from  fishing trip and I was surprised of the authenticity that is provided both in culture and food.  Being a traveler to Mexico I know what the real deal is when it comes to food so I can honestly say that this place always bring me back to Mexico and the good times and good food. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for good authentic Mexican food... It doesn't get any better than this especially in Canada."}
{"text":"Went with a girlfriend of mine a few nights ago and I was reminded once again why this pace is one of my favourite places to go.  Of course we had the Chorinachos and for once I decided to have the Camarones with the Borrachos sauce (wine and garlic sauce).  Only down part is that there were only about 5 pcs of shrimp, however they were cooked to perfection.    My friend, who was a first time visitor to the restaurant, had ordered the Basa Fish which I had a piece of and it was perfection.  The large fish filet was lightly battered and perfectly fried.  It was covered with the most amazing tasting sauce which was also accompanied by a generous amount of shrimp.  What was very impressive was how crispy the fish was even with all the sauce.  This is probably the best fish dish I've ever had in town (GTA).  The next best fish dish I've had and will never forget is Red Snapper at Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita in Mexico so that says a lot!  This particular dish is part of their special menu but great news; it will be part of their new menu very soon.  Definitely 5/5."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service at a cute little yellow-walled restaurant. Love that they give you nachos before your order. Would definitely recommend - everything is delicious."}
{"text":"While the decor is not much more than a lot of stereotypical Mexican souvenirs, it's alright because all the attention is focused on the most important thing, the FOOD!  I've had a number of items from their menu and my recommendations are the nachos with Chorizo, and the Chicken in a poblano cream sauce.  The nachos are made with handmade tortilla chips, in-house made chorizo, beans and cheese.  The presentation doesn't do it much justice but once you put one of these chips in your mouth, you experience the spiced pork goodness.  I brought a friend with me to have these and she wanted another order after we finished.  As her entree.  The chicken in poblano cream sauce is a house speciality creation, not the most authentic Mexican dish but the chicken breast simmered in this flavourful sauce is tender and so delicious, that when I order take out, I try to save the extra sauce for later just to dip bread in - or pour over anything I can think of.  On the menu you'll also find  enchiladas, chimichangas, camerones (Shrimp) and rice.  All dishes are served with a small salad, and beans topped with queso fresco on the same plate.  (Even the beans are really good.)  They make their Guacamole fresh to order, sometime table side if it's not busy. Nothing is terribly spicy, but everything is very flavourful and you can tell spices were carefully selected to draw out certain flavours.  If you want something made spicy, just ask!  If dining in, the staff - it's a family run establishment - are very nice and very accommodating.  They have a few Mexican beers such as Modelo, Dos Equis, and of course Coronas.  Their margaritas are really good too.  The food is amazing.  I eat here often.  I dine in, and order takeout.  If I go without my husband, he gets upset.  The menu is of a good size, and everything is authentic.  If you order anything with chorizo, or the poblano cream sauce, you will make it a point to make a return visit.    The family and their extended family own restaurants all over the Toronto and Durham region, having visited a few others, this is the best one.    Oh I forgot to mention, the food besides being amazing, is also very reasonably priced, a couple can dine for $50 with an appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink each!"}
{"text":"I only recently found this place despite living so close. I'm so glad I did, though: I'm definitely going to become a repeat customer.  Cielito Lindo's is in a rather non-descript plaza, with (as others have mentioned) less than stylish interior décor, but that doesn't take anything away from the food. The staff are kind and this is very much a family-run place: I think I actually saw the owner's young daughters sitting quietly at a table, playing on their iPad.  I recently ordered the Tabasco combo, which includes one beef burrito with a spicy red sauce and one chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce. You also get a portion of rice, refried beans, and simple salad. Before your entrée, you also get a healthy complimentary appetizer of tortilla chips and two sauces (a mild salsa, and that spicy red sauce -- definitely keep some water on hand for that.)  It's a good amount of food - I was stuffed before even finishing either my burrito or enchilada. I preferred the enchilada over the burrito (liked chicken better than beef), but both were delicious. I don't know what they do with that tomatillo sauce but it's SO GOOD. I just wanted to dip everything in it and then lick my fingers afterwards.  My meal was about 12 bucks; totally worth it.  The only downside to this place is that it is tiny. I would love to come here with a group of girlfriends, but I don't think we'd all be able to fit (assuming other customers are there - and there are ALWAYS customers there.)  I would love to see this restaurant grow into a huge success, offering the owners an opportunity to upgrade and maybe move into a bigger space. With their food, I'm certain they could fill a place three times the size easily with hungry customers."}
{"text":"Complimentary appetizers at a resto is seldom that when I actually get it from a casual dining spot I'm happily surprised! Nothing fancy but the nachos and simple salsa were a great start.   The chimichanaga entree was good. I tasted the beef. It could've been seasoned more so of course I reached over for my partner's mole sauce and covered my chimichanaga with it! Mole sauce on errthing!   The chicken enchilada with mole sauce was the better dish. The mole sauce is slightly sweeter than I'm use to- more sweet than spiced but I liked it like that!   This is my 4th time here. The closest Mexican resto spot in Scarborough without having to venture out downtown. Ya know when you're from Scarbs, anywhere outside of it is a little journey! Lol"}
{"text":"love this little restaurant, really fresh and tasty food, just one down fall is don't go there when its busy or expect a loooong wait for your food"}
{"text":"- good mexican food for the heart of pickering - very simple place with tacky decor - always go for the specials. had the pollo pablano today.... really nice chipotle sauce - i'd come back - i do wish they had more types of tacos like al pastor"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. And the owner is a great guy! Really takes care of the customer. Makes food with passion. U looking for real authentic mexican food. Well this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this Pickering restaurant for something different and were pleasantly surprised..   The restaurant decor was pretty basic but the quality of the food and the portions were both very good.   We tried the Pollo Mole and the Enchaladas Suisa with a chicken filling.  We'll definitely be exploring more of menu in the near future."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews I thought I would try this place.  The food was okay but nothing special.  The salsa was really bland - ranks as probably the worst salsa I've had.  The flavor of the enchilada and burrito I ordered was okay but lacked something.  Nothing to do with the food but they were playing Puerto Rican music videos on TV's and some were borderline inappropriate (entire screen filled with barely clothed women's backside shaking).  Not something I want to see while eating (nor my kids if they were with me.  I was eating with a Mexican friend who told me they were Puerto Rican videos.  With other Mexican food options in the area I will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"This modest, family restaurant became a staple for me and my family, but I wasn't aware just how great it was until I moved out of Pickering and tried to find anything that compares. There is nothing that comes close further east, on the Danforth, Burlington way - better Mexican than even in Mexico.   Others don't compare to Cielito because they are a combination of overpriced, have inferior food, or provide average service.   I always have the Tobasco, and then invade everyone else's plates. The style of cooking is definitely regional, homestyle, and fresh.  But I never leave before having their Fried Ice-cream which is always made to please and the very best around.  This restaurant is great for hungry families, budgets, and casual fun dates who wish to experience a king and gracious staff. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ive been there twice and both times had different dishes and they were both delish. Great authentic food. Background music also is nice, adds to the ambiance.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of four.  Delicious Mexican food.  We had various dishes -- flautas, fajitas, tacos, and other things.  Everything tasted delicious.  Portions are pretty large.  The server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Food: Amazing food! The portions are large and the drinks are well spiked.! When you go, try the enchiladas, enchiladas suizas, or chimichanga. Delish -accompanied with rice, re-fried beans, and salad. They usually serve you homemade chips to start. ....though you should really order the guacamole -so good, and in a great presentation dish. The dessert is okay. The main dishes is what do it for me.  Service: The service is okay. Sometimes you have to wait a while for the food to get to you, but once you get it, it's worth it.  Venue: The place is small. The actual size of the restaurant is pretty small -with maybe 10 tables at most. The atmosphere is great there though. They're always playing the latin american music, the walls are decorated with beautiful artisan pieces from Mexico, Mexican sombreros, and parrots of different sizes.  Price: Pretty affordable. An enchilada dinner, for example, is about $10 flat."}
{"text":"Been coming her for 2 years and the place is absolutely good ! The owners are very friendly. Totally recommended"}
{"text":"So I'm on the phone with my insurance company complaining about... I mean... \"enquiring\" as to why my insurance has gone up when the girl on the other line asks where I live. When I tell her, Pickering, I didn't quite get the response I expected.  \"Hey, have you ever been to Cielito Lindo?\"  I had not and of course, if this is the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of Pickering, I clearly needed to find out more about this place.  We had a nice chat.  The long and short of it is... there were more accidents in Pickering this past year... oh, and I need to go to this restaurant.  Now I'm new to Mexican food... I haven't even had as much as a burrito. I pleaded ignorance to our server and she was more than happy to walk us through the menu and help us make our selections.  My husband opted for the Tabasco from the 'Create-A-Combo' section ($11.95) and I went with the Pollo con Mole ($14.95)... I'm sorry, did you say chocolate? Sign me up! Both dishes were served with rice, salad and re-fried beans.   We were first presented with a complimentary platter of what appeared to be, homemade tortilla chips accompanied by a red dipping sauce. Absolutely delicious, and a nice way to start the meal.  The Tabasco came with one beef burrito with red sauce and one chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce. Simply a plate of comfort food. Each bite was fantastic and with just the right amount of heat.  My Mole was outstanding... even though I don't really have anything to compare it to. I know what I like... and this is it! The chicken strips were tender little pieces of happiness coated in a wonderful spicy... chocolaty... heavenly sauce which I couldn't get enough of. Holy Mole!  Did this delicious experience soften the blow of my insurance going up? Not really, but I know I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ay caramba! This place has a real latin feeling going on!  I always get the chimichangas. The refried beans are perfect. The salad is always crisp and fresh. The service is very sweet and hospitable. I'm getting hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop shop.  Bets to go during a busy meal time, food is fresher.  The family owns a chain of these restaurants. i think 5 of them.  this locations is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Went here for the first time on Sat, March 4 for dinner. Not a big place so it's better for couples and small groups or families. Decor is festive and loved that you can watch and listen to music native to this family's home land. We ordered Calamari and Nachos Fiesta to start. Entrees were Fish tacos, Beef tacos and the Tabasco combo. For dessert, we had deep fried ice cream. You can tell the food is made with love here. A little bit of a wait time but it's all worth it!  This is the real deal! They've been open for 10 years now and we are sure to come back (all the way from Vaughan!) This place is as authentic as you can get."}
{"text":"This place got a lot of raves, but to me it was just okay.  Would probably not come back.  Chips were not fresh, guacamole had no cilantro and no visible chopped tomato pieces and an outre flavour (could not quite put a finger on what it was).  The salsa served with the chips was flavourless and seemed like diluted tomato paste.  Main dishes were reasonably generous though they did not come with  warm tortillas on the side.  The burrito in one of the combos was much more like an ordinary enchilada. Refritos were a bit too runny.  Flavours were okay but could be a bit spicier.  Kitchen was extremely slow (one cook on a busy night).  One positive thing I can say is that it is an open kitchen and seems reasonably clean.  Good selection of Mexican beer; we did not try the margaritas.  Small storefont so not good for large groups.  I have given up on finding good authentic Mexican food in Canada.  Either it is overpriced and made by gringos for gringos only or it is reasonably authentic (like this place) but just not that good.  For now I'll stick to burrito joints and indulge my taste for more authentic Mexican when I visit the States."}
{"text":"Visited their Pickering location last week and ordered camarones nopalitos and a acapulco combo.  While we were waiting, they served us some house made tortilla chips with their very well balanced red sauce for dipping.  Soon after arrived 6 large shrimps cooked perfectly in a slightly tangy and spicy green cactus sauce in my very reasonably priced appetizer with a side of garlicky bread.  The beef burrito and chicken enchilada were both very flavourful in a mild red sauce (tasted similar to the sauce they served with their tortilla chips earlier) with moist meat inside.  They are now licensed and we enjoyed bottled tecate with our meal.   The meal was very satisfying and we will definitely return to try their steak."}
{"text":"My brother and I were really craving Mexican food but didn't want to drive out far from where we were. Searched on Yelp and found this place 5 minutes away from home. It seemed to be a small little family owned restaurant, in the plaza beside Swiss chalet.   The woman who was serving us was incredibly nice & welcomed us right away. The food took a little longer than I would like it BUT it was so worth it because it was well cooked, and was delicious. You could tell that the owners appreciate the business they get and really take the time to make sure their food is served well & full of flavor.   Will definitely be coming back again to order. New favourite spot in Pickering."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food at very reasonable price, simply loved it. Will soon come again with kids."}
{"text":"Hidden Mexican gem in Pickering. The place has a good selection of different unique Mexican dishes such as shrimps in tomatilla sauce. We went here on Wednesday night and there was a constant flow of customers to eat in and take out. The food does take longer because there was only one cook, however it was worth the wait.  I would recommend this place for casual dining."}
{"text":"Found this little gem about 3 years a go and been going ever since. The Decor is very simple some  tacky decorations and Spanish music witch is a nice touch.  But don't let the decorations fool you this a awesome little restaurant. I usually start with a shrimp appetizer witch comes with toasted bread for dipping. Next I get a shrimp burrito witch comes with beans rice and a salad. Have also that their guacamole is to die for. Prices are decent great little place if your hankering for some authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"Popped  by for a quick dinner yesterday.  Ordered a glass of red wine sangria which was good.  The guacamole was very good! It tasted very fresh.   I got the appetizer portion of the shrimp in garlic and wine sauce. I got it with bread instead of rice. It was good too.   I live in the west end of the city and am rarely in Pickering but I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I been going to his restaurant for many years, here food is amazing, been to Mexico many times and there's no difference in taste. The husband a wife handle the restaurant do a amazing job in the coming aspect and taking care of clients"}
{"text":"Sat in for Monday evening dinner. Gestured to sit by a smiling middle-aged woman. Already knew we were off to a good start.  Ordered chorinachos, the enchilada suiza, and fish tacos between 2 people. The chorinachos were unlike anything else... the Mexican sausage did not overwhelm the other ingredients but at the same time took centre stage. It was served pipping fresh with a good amount of crunchy nachos versus nachos completely obscured in toppings, just how I like it.  The entrees took a while to exit the kitchen but not a person in the restaurant seemed to be effected by this, I can justify insofar that when it did arrive on the plate before me there was only love. Just love. The enchilada was a delicious extravagance of beef, cheese, sour cream, and green tomatillo sauce. Though it was not seasoned (read: over-seasoned) to my usual taste, only deep appreciation for the interaction of ingredients as they should taste could be had.  The fish tacos were good but the least outstanding of this meal. No complaints but would explore other menu options before reordering them.  The service and interior of the restaurant was nothing short of charming, however quirky the bird decorations were. I would recommend this hidden gem in Pickering to everyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food was good. Nice fresh chips and salsa.  I had the steak, nice spicy touch and the price was fair. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Excellente!!! Absolutely delicious food. Fresh, hot, perfectly seasoned. Clean, friendly and authentic. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We tend to get the same thing every time: Guacamole (with nacho chips) and chicken burritos.  The quality and taste if these are consistently great each time.  I wish they would enlarge the height  of the pickup window and update the decor."}
{"text":"This place is the typical don't judge a book by its cover. The decor and the upkeep of this place is not the greatest, however the food is pretty great! They have beer and some mixed drinks. You get complimentary nachos and salsa while waiting for your food, which was hot and the green and red sauces were tasty. I ordered a Chimichanga which was huge and stuffed with meat, served with side of rice and guacamole. My partner ordered the chicken fajitas, also served with rice, this was also very tasty. Portions were great for the price, we couldn't even finish my meal. They do have dessert but we were too stuffed to try it. We will definitely be visiting again! Delish!"}
