{"text":"The Teutonia Männerchor is a private club promoting German cultural traditions in the Pittsburgh area. It has over 2,000 members from all walks of life. Mostly, the Männerchor is known for its Ratskeller bar and lunch restaurant and the many German cultural food festivals it has throughout the year. At Lunch, you often find a good German buffet and inexpensive German beers from their bar. Their German cultural festivals are usually well done and very authentic, but mostly populated by an older crowd. Membership (or the company of a member) is required to eat at the Ratskeller for lunch, but non members can attend their German festivals. This place is by far the most \"authentic\" German club in the area and the food is mostly good. The beer selection is great and the prices for everything are reasonable. If you like German food or have a connection to Germany, you should try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The lunch buffet is incredible and a great value.  Our whole family has enjoyed the Oktoberfest events, which always sell out.   I highly recommend stopping by if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"Tetuonia Männerchor Hall is a testament to Pittsburgh's German immigrants, and their desire to keep alive their cultural traditions.  Through food, drink, music, dance, and fellowship, this private club has been a gathering place for Teutons since 1888. 

Located just across the Allegheny river from downtown Pittsburgh, the club was a social anchor of the once-predominantly German \"Deutschtown\" neighborhood. The Hall was constructed using a \"fachwerk\" timber framing method, which features  exposed posts and beams, giving the building a decidedly European flavor.  The neighborhood has changed significantly over the decades, yet the Teutonia still stands, with a vibrant, enthusiastic membership...continuing the German traditions today.

Since this is a private, members-only club, guests are admitted by invitation only. Additionally, proper attire is encouraged in the upstairs banquet hall.  This means dress slacks and jackets for men, and dresses for women.  Traditional Bavarian folk attire, including lederhosen and dirndls, are always in good taste.

The downstairs Ratskellar serves up delicious, authentic German cuisine and hosts monthly social gatherings, including a billiards league and a \"66 league\", where members and their guests play an old German pinochle-like card game.  The original Ratskellar was constructed and finished by founding members, and the pride still shows, as is evident in the craftsmanship of the bar, the woodwork and beautiful murals in the dining room. 

The upstairs Hall, complete with stage and a full-service bar, is the home of the Männerchor and Damenchor--the choir groups that are the namesake of the club

Along with a co-ed group, the three choirs perform not only at Teutonia, but at parades and festivals around the Pittsburgh area. They share usage of the hall with the Alpen Schuhplattlers, the Hall's resident dance group. The Schuhplattlers perform a variety of Bavarian-Tyrolean dances, incorporating traditional costumes; often accompanied by one of the many local bands that regularly perform at this long-standing club. A charitable organization, the Schuhplattlers perform at German clubs across the Midwest, helping to foster a better understanding and appreciation of Bavarian-Tyrolean culture. Their outreach efforts include a children's Kindergruppe, helping to instill German pride in the next generation.

Constantly looking forward, a new biergarten offers food and festivity under the stars. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004, Teutonia Männerchor offers a rich celebration of German culture and camaraderie.

{"text":"I was fortunate enough to enjoy a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration here this past weekend. A friend of mine is a member of this private German heritage club, and got tickets for me and our lady friends for this celebration.

We brought our own steins (which cost varying prices to fill throughout the night depending on whom we asked), but were always full of beer from excellent breweries like Spaten and Hofbrauhaus. We enjoyed a phenomenal buffet, with two delicious wursts, pork cutlets, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, and a whole mess of tasty German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age, drinking beer and enjoying awesomely German music from \"Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine\".

What a great time this place was! I've never had so much fun being 1/4 German in all my life. If you have a chance to visit, take it!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple Fridays ago to go to for lunch. Pretty cool place and the food was pretty good. I had the sausage platter, sauerkraut, coleslaw, and red cabbage...mmmmm! I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes. My only complaint is that the beers were a little small."}
{"text":"We were invited to Teutonia by a club member for their Sunday brunch.  It was crowded so definitely make a reservation, I don't think we would have gotten a table if our host hadn't called ahead.

They had a variety of sausages and sauerkraut as part of the buffet along with eggs and potatoes - all of which were tasty.  The had a pastry table and there were omelets made to order.  

I had always been curious about this place and was glad to have been invited to brunch.  The outside of the building is very unique and looks European as does the inside.  If you get a chance to visit, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Das ist fantastisch!

The Teutonia Männerchor is bar far the most authentic German beer hall and restaurant in the Pittsburgh region. With it's historic ratskeller and saengerhalle, this is a place that truly can't be missed. It's quite deceiving from the look of the outside as well. Although not located in the best of neighborhoods, it has spacious parking and I can assure you it's very safe indeed. It truly cannot be missed, if you're in the Pittsburgh region and in need of a cold beer, authentic Deutsch food and friendly and warm company. I should also mention, the prices are right, very affordable for what you get, I advise the Lunch Buffet's on Wednesdays and Thursdays."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The beer is good, the atmosphere is great, the people are friendly.  Private, yes.  Get an introduction and join !"}
{"text":"Private Club - good German fair when serving. Like the place and am a member."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm biased because I'm actually German. And in Germany I'd probably never set a foot into a traditionally designed beer house - just because I'm from Berlin and this is more stuff Bavarians would do.

But I was in Pittsburgh so different rules. Came here for brunch on a Sunday because of an invite. You're not a member? Sorry no entry. Luckily, my accent gave it away and apparently Germans are always welcome.

They serve proper Bavarian food - Wurst, Bacon (?), Red Cabbage, fried potatoes - pretty solid. You can also get omelettes together with a Krug of German beer. Is that what we Germans do for breakfast back home? Maybe in the Bavarian woods, I'm not sure, but it is definitely something.

The interior is quite unique - imagine Oktoberfest in 1935 and you get the idea. Fun fact: not everyone in there speaks German and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade. I do, however, appreciate that this Pittsburgh institution is around for more than 100 years and hope they'll stick around for a while.

Maybe, in another 100 years, even the neighborhood won't look as dodgy as it looks right now."}
