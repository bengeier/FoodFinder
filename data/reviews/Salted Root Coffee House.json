{"text":"Super friendly barista and good coffee. Got a coffee with a shot of espresso for $3.25, which is pretty reasonable.

Good free wifi, nice background music, lots of power outlets. Great place to do work or chat."}
{"text":"Yum!!! 
I'm excited about this new place! The staff is really friendly, and the lattes are yummy!"}
{"text":"Love the usage of space very open and it flows. Love the staff, they are soo nice! The one bad thing I had to say is that I ordered a chai latte from there and it was watery but I don't know if that has anything to do with it being the last chai the day.(my friends hot chocolate was really good though)"}
{"text":"Updating my review to add more good news-- I got the grilled cheese, which had multiple kinds of cheese and some sort of red wine chutney on it, and it was amazing!! Also comes with a bag of chips. I'd previously only gotten espresso drinks but I got just a regular drip coffee last time and it was still wonderful. They also now have a list you can be added to to get deals texted to your phone, and they have adult coloring books out to use-- I love it! My go-to place. Just wish they were open past 5pm."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with a lot of charm! I stopped over there for some quick ice coffee and loved it. They serve all sorts of coffee and have a few tables for people to study. Apparently they offer services to help charge your phone? I didn't ask but there was a sign saying they would. That's always nice when your phone goes out in the middle of work and you forgot your charger.
The coffee was very good as well. They have a large array of flavor shots and I opted for coffee. When I went, the shop was not to busy. Not sure if that was because school is out, but it would be a great place to study during the school year when all the libraries are packed."}
{"text":"Great, cozy atmosphere with good drinks and a yummy selection of sandwiches! Highly recommended"}
