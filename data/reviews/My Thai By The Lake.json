{"text":"Gave this spot another shot today. I ordered delivery and it was really quick and friendly as always. I ordered the green curry and an order of spring rolls. I won't order the spring rolls again, they taste weird, maybe over fried or old oil. Also I think there's potato in there which is weird. The curry was pretty good though.  Nice and spicy and coconutty. Meh, I don't know what to think."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and this will definitely be a regular take out spot! The dishes we ordered were all good. Basil beef and Panang curry were excellent and included steamed rice. Vegetable fried rice and stir fried veggies were fresh and not greasy, if slightly lacking in flavour. Some things have a pleasant hint of spice even if not indicated. The price is very reasonable and the food took only about a half hour to be delivered."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and the food arrived hot and fresh. Big portions. We enjoyed leftovers for days after. We ordered mango salad, coconut rice, pad Thai, ginger chicken, and yellow curry."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. It's the best Thai food I've ever eaten, including the nice expensive downtown spots. They've got generous portions, not greasy food, all in this unassuming little restaurant. Most people come here to pick up because there are only 4 tables total and the space isn't too nice. If you're willing to sacrifice decor for taste, I couldn't recommend it more! If you are ok with takeout, do yourself a favor and try this place. Everything is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy spicy noodles, great family run place, not A lot of seating but the food was good and tasty"}
{"text":"This was quite a find as we walked along the Lakeshore. Very unassuming with only about 6 tables. Their food is excellent and really reflects the freshness of Thai food. We have been there about three times and every time the food has been excellent. Their use of fruits (mostly mango) is superb) and vegetables is great. Quite a diverse menu and they give brief explanations of each dish. It's not like a lot of places where you feel that something is pulled out out of a steaming dish...appears to be made to order. As members of the community it is nice to order from the hood instead of something like Spring Rolls. The Lakeshore (especially in New Toronto) is hurting badly. We need more places like this!  The servings are quite large, we ended eating leftovers at home instead of regular leftovers which are left until you play fridge CSI. The family has kept it simple and it is a formula that works.  It's also easy to get to, even if you live in one of the new condos by the lake. Direct run on the 501 car."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. The food is always delicious. Big portions! Staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I popped in here one night to get take-out. I think I ordered Thai Spicy Noodles with Beef. The lady was very friendly and prepared the food for me right away. The portion size was generous and the meat and veggies were very fresh - I could tell they used good quality ingredients. The only downside was that the noodles were a bit overdone. HOWEVER, that could have been because they went directly into the take-out container, which steamed them. Judging from the other reviews, I'd likely return and try something else."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Family run, look forward having them at the end of my street when I move close by!  A small humble dining room, only a few seats, so probably best for take out.  Got an easy order of spring rolls and 2 pad thai's. The spring rolls were good and hot, lots of sweet and spicy sauce with it. The pad thai's were pretty standard but the container was bursting full, pleased with the amount served!"}
