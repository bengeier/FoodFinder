{"text":"Their meat is amazing! We bought some for news years, once in a while for dinner and I just called to check something and I will definitely be ordering very soon for an event.  Ive called a few times to ask for a few things and Annette usually answers the phone and she is so polite, has patience and is very kind!   ANNETTE SI LLEGA A MIRAR ESTO: muchas gracias por siempre ser muy amable. Y por contestar el tel√©fono contentamente."}
{"text":"We purchased the marinated chuckroll and the marinated chicken breasts and made some of the best street tacos I've ever eaten. Our guests couldn't get enough of them and La Herradero helped make me the hero of my own party. The chuckroll and chicken were cut so thin they cook up quick. I was able to prepare 11 lbs of the beef and 6 lbs of the chicken in less than an hour on my charcoal and gas grills.   Their produce is fresh and the garlic bulbs we picked up seemed to have more flavor than the ones you get from the big box supermarkets. Their red and green salsas were spicy and tangy and a nice accompaniment to the tacos. We picked up a cake for desert, too, and it was moist and delicious!  I'm telling you, this place will help you make a dinner better than anything you will ever find in a Mexican restaurant here in the Vegas Valley. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get your carne asada meats. The meats are marinated perfectly and after grilling, they come out tender and flavorful. I used to go to Cardenas to get my meats until a friend turned me on to this place and I am so thankful he did. We actually use this place to get meats for our company BBQs as well. There are never any leftovers and always rave reviews on the taste of the meats. And the prices definitely make the bigger mercado's look silly. Don't be dissuaded by the looks on the outside or when you walk in. This is definitely a diamond in the rough."}
