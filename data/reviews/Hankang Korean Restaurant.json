{"text":"Only Korean restaurant i've been too in Calgary and in my opinion, I have no desire to even try any other place! The service is excellent and the food is absolutely delicious. Always come here at lunch to pick up meals for everyone at work and the owner/waitress is always so kind and she always remembers me now and even my orders. 

Great restaurant, great food & great service. 5 Stars for SURE!"}
{"text":"Love Hankang.  I've been coming here for lunch for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed.  The chicken and beef lunch special are very reasonably priced and always excellent.  Both are approximately 10$ each and come with potatoes, salad, a couple of spring rolls, as well as a starter soup. I highly recommend the chicken lunch special! 
Atmosphere- not exactly cutting edge but very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"It was really good back then when I was in high school (2006-2009). I went back to this place recently and noticed that food portions was smaller with less meat and vegetables and prices much higher. Flavor can't compare to high school time as well. The food is just ok now."}
{"text":"We came here because the Yelp reviews were pretty good.  We ordered 2 beef rib lunch specials and an oxtail stew.  The beef ribs were on the sweet side but was still tasty.  The oxtail stew came out tasting like water.  The server gave me a little dish of salt and pepper for the stew.  Because the broth was lacking meat/bone broth flavour, my stew ended up tasting like salted water.  As nice as the service was, I would not come here again."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family run Korean restaurant.  We had to travel from Lake Louise to Calgary for a medical emergency. When everything turned out ok, we sought out a lunch treat, and boy were we happy we found this place. Terrific food and reasonable prices. The restaurant is run by a lovely couple who went out of their way to make us feel at home.  We returned on our way to the airport about a week later and were greeted like part of the family.

On our first visit we had the lunch specials.  The price was incredibly reasonable, the portions gigantic. I had short ribs (yum) and my wife had pork bulgogi. Each plate came with tofu miso soup, two spring rolls, crispy potatoes in a sweet sauce, rice, and bapsang (sweet and sour daikon radish salad) practically overflowing the large plates. We are major foodies with a taste for Asian cuisine and we agreed that the spring rolls were the best we'd ever had. Everything is homemade and simply delicious. At the end of the meal we were served a unique and delicious probiotic Korean yogurt, a perfect ending to a scrumptious meal.  

When we returned, it was dinnertime so we ordered a la carte, dol sot bi bim bap and beef bulgogi. (If you haven't had dol sot bi bim bap, it differs from the ordinary variety in that it's served in a hot stone bowl, which crisps the rice again and again.) Once again everything was delicious. We just had to get an order of those fantastic spring rolls again (5 to an order!) To our surprise and delight, dinner came with misomsoup again, delicious kimchi, bapsang, those wonderful potatoes, and a tempura style sliced zuchini that was out of this world, topped off with another Korean yogurt as a finishing touch.

These folks know how to cook and they know how to make you feel at home. A warm hug at the end of the meal was welcome and seemed totally natural.  

We loved this place. Having come for the amazing scenery of the Canadian Rockies, we were so happy to find such great food in a little neighborhood mall.  When we return, we'll be stopping in again for sure.  You won't regret seeking Hangkang restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Loved the service--they were super attentive to our needs and assisted in helping us get started on our orders. The servers were polite and friendly.The restaurant was kind of on the smaller side but we went in the early evening to not be a ruckus with our large party of 8.  We ended up ordering the party meals to try a bit of everything. We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the various meats, soups, and small dishes. They also provided complementary small yogurt desserts. The owner, knowing that it was my birthday, actually went out of her way and gifted us a package of small yogurts! A+"}
{"text":"Finally! A Korean Resto I'd like to go to, again and again.. 
I found this through Yelp, thanks for the reviews , I decided this is where we go to celebrate our anniversary and we called in for a reservation, we arrived on time and was ushered amply to our seat, very friendly staff, after much deliberation,  we ordered fried dumplings as our appetizer and samgyeopsal as our main with makkoli (rice wine) as our main drink. The food was served with side dishes of kimchi which I find fresh, sweet and tangy , a very refreshing taste, the best kimchi I had so far, and me, not being a fan , I'm actually a changed person and decided to give this a try, then the pickled radish is also as good, not too sour nor sweet, a nice combo of seasonings.. I'm actually impressed. Then sweet potatoes, wow, best ones I've tasted so far, I must commend the chef! Hats off , indeed! Not too sweet, just enough flavors to keep the flavor at bay. The fried zucchini is also good, a little mushy but being served alongside the best side dishes, I couldn't ask for more. Finally, the samgyeopsal, I love the seasonings, how the serving is not just for 2 people but for 4-6 even, except the garlic oil with too much sea salt on it, I love the bean paste ~ I can say, it's the bomb! Thanks for sharing your passion and love for food and sharing it to us, this is a Family Resto that's deserving of being the best korean Resto here in Canada. Daebak! (Awesome!) Btw, I'd be back for more! And I'll take pictures next time since I was was too hungry I didn't mind to take one and just savored the food"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place in NW great location near Northland mall.
Food was good over all. Great service, the servers are really attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff was extremely kind and friendly. They were generous with food servings. Went here for the first time for mother's day dinner and they even gave my mom some treats which she absolutely loved! Will definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking in front. Reasonably priced large portions, tasty white rice and crispy dumplings and great service. However, the meats and banchan were very different from the Korean food we are accustomed to in New York city - too much sugar and not enough garlic."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Overall, check this place out since this is one of the best Korean places in Calgary for authentic Korean food. 

Hankang is one of the best Korean places in Calgary to go for authentic Korean food; owned by Koreans. I suggest you check this place out if you are craving Korean and in the area (it's right across from Sir Winston Churchill High School). I only gave it an 'overall experience' a 3.5 because among my favourite Korean restaurants in Calgary this one is kind of on the bottom and will only pay another visit if I'm in the area. However, it's still a great place for terrific food. 

I stumbled upon this place after my bf was craving Korean and I happened to have a discount card to Hankang. Most items on the menu come with (miso) soup, rice, and side dishes (kimchi, garlic potatos - my fav, zucchini, bean sprouts and sometimes deep fried tofu). If you want more, you have to pay an extra $2 which is one thing I don't like about this Korean restaurant.

Tried the Beef Jeon Gol hot pot stew for two ($29.95) which is a Korean style beef soup with mushrooms and vegetables.  As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I don't really like Korean hotpot as much as Chinese because it already comes prepared and you just have to turn on the burner and wait. It's also not worth the money. Thus, if you do come here I highly suggest you try their meat BBQ. The last couple of times my bf and I came here, we almost always got the BBQ beef because it's super flavourful (one of the best places to have it at) and the portion was enough to feed both of us. I suggest you try their beef bulgogi ($15.95), or if you like spicy their Jeyuk Bokum ($16.95 spicy marinated pork with vegetables), or Osam Bulgogi ($17.95 spicy marinated side pork and squid with vegetables). They are all equally tasty! The meat comes out sizzling on a hot plate and the aroma gets your taste buds going. Our meal ended with a cool lychee served in its juices which is refreshing and cleansing to the palate.

Just to mention, you can also do your own BBQing here, but might end up smelling like it since there is no ventilation. Either way, the restaurant will have an amazing aroma!
 
If you're looking to pair the BBQ meat with something, then try the Chap Chae which is seasoned glass noodles with beef, mushroom and assorted vegetables (Sm-$10.95; Lg-$13.95). You can't go wrong with Korean glass noodles especially if you're looking for something non-spicy. It's been very good at almost all the Korean restaurants I've been to.  

HanKang also offers lunch specials which I got the chance to try with a couple friends after class.Their lunch specials ($9.53) consists of a choice between short beef ribs or chicken bulgogi with steamed rice, two pieces of spring rolls, a salad and soup. I got the chicken bulgogi lunch special which had a good portion of meat but the chicken bulgogi was was kind of disappointing because it was under seasoned. Don't let this tiny detail deter you from the rest of the BBQ meat though! Overall, it's an OK deal and I was definitely full by the end. However, I still consider Sura Korean Restaurant's lunch special top notch and well worth the money (see my other review). 

The atmosphere is really nice, kind of old fashioned/traditional but still warm and inviting. The owner is always there and he is a really nice and friendly person. Although he and some of the servers don't speak a lot of English, the service is still good. Since the restaurant is small, a quick glance around the room by the servers is just needed to make sure your cups are topped off or if you need anything else. It's a tad bit more expensive (maybe a dollar or two more) than some other places but the food and environment makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've been going here since high school, as it's right across from Churchill, and I've loved it ever since. The owner is so lovely and so nice, and all the other staff members are incredibly lovely too. Food is great and the prices are awesome considering how much you get for one order. Wish they had a bigger menu, though."}
{"text":"Very good family owned Korean restaurant, dinning room is average size, a little older decor but clean.
Good service, friendly staff. Good place for lunch too.

{"text":"I've been here twice and have tried the chap chae and the beef bulgogi. The bbq dishes come with rice and some korean condiments such as kim chee and sprouts. You also get a bowl of miso soup to start. It's decent food and good portion for the price. The chap chae was not my favourite. I've had better at other places but I enjoyed the bulgogi. Service is friendly and I love their water glasses, they are sort of a diamond pattern on them and they have them in different colours, it just makes you feel like you're drinking something more than water. Service was friendly and the boss lady comes around to check on you and to make sure that you're doing ok."}
{"text":"The boys and I were craving some good, affordable Korean food for lunch.  Our friendly server quickly took our orders (my son and I ordered the BBQ beef ribs(LA kalbi) lunch special for $12.40; hubby had the pork bulgogi) and promptly brought our miso soups to the table.  This was followed by a huge plate of kalbi, rice, vegetarian spring rolls, romaine lettuce, pickled daikon and carrots, and garlic (glass) potatoes.   The BBQ sauce on the kalbi was a bit too sweet for my liking, but at least the ribs weren't drowning in the sauce -- they were tender and grilled perfectly.   
Hubby and I didn't care for the sweet yogurt drink served at the end of the meal, so our son inhaled all three yogurt drinks in a few gulps.
We will certainly return to try the other items on the menu (hot pots, seafood pancake, glass noodles, rice cakes)."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, and nice atmosphere.

I can't get enough of the lunch specials, they are amazing. The service is fast. The people are nice. And the restaurant doesn't feel cramped like many other Korean places."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their korean food is excellent. We live nearby so every time we get lazy and don't want to cook, we would come to hankang for their dol sot bul go gi. So delicious and reasonably priced! Highly recommended to korean food lovers. What I love about their bulgogi is that the rice is nicely browned and crispy in the stone bowl and the veggies and meat are nicely flavoured. Their side dishes are great too! Service is always excellent and we never have to wait for our table. 5/5 for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time that I had eaten Korean food. This could very well have been the first. Hankang is tucked into a strip mall out of sight from the main road. You'd either have to know about this place or be actively looking for Korean restaurants to find this gem. Having never visited before I asked the server what I should order. They pointed out a small lunch menu with beef, pork or chicken dishes for $10. I ordered the beef.

The meal came with a miso soup (Japanese?), rice, two lightly fried spring rolls, garlic potatoes, small salad and some sprouts. The beef portion was more than adequate. It was around 1PM and I hadn't eaten all day yet this meal was more than enough to satisfy my hunger. The flavors were fantastic. I especially like the BBQ beef.

After reading some of the reviews on Yelp afterwards I've come to realize that the remaining menu leaves a lot for me to explore. I'm looking forward to returning and trying some of the Korean hot pot."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a strip mall behind another strip mall, so it has zero visibility from the street. My family and I tried the lunch specials: my wife and son each ordered the BBQ short ribs and I had the pork bulgogi. The meal is served with rice, salad, and a miso-style soup. Portion sizes were generous, and more importantly, the food was tasty and served at the right temperature. Included was a small yogurt drink, but it was so sickly sweet I couldn't finish it. The service was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Real Korean food in the NW!  I've always wanted to try this restaurant and finally had a chance this evening.  Restaurant is actually a little tough to find, opposite Winston Churchill High School on 52 Ave NW, behind Yamato Japanese Restaurant.

The dishes we ordered were:
- Appetizer:  Seafood pancake - Delicious fluffy & spongy omelette with fresh seafood like squid and shrimp, green onions and comes with a vinegar dipping sauce.  The \"spongy\" part is like a tapioca-flour mixed with the egg.  
- Note - all entrees come with side dishes - KimChee, Garlic Potatoes, Zucchini, Bean Sprouts and Tofu.  If you ask for more, it will cost you $2 each.  Also, a bowl of miso soup was served to each person.
- 2 orders of Bulgogi - Marinated beef in a sweet sauce, with some onion on a hot plate - comes with a bowl of rice
- Wanted to order the OxTail Soup but it was not available - opted for Bulgogi instead.
- 2 orders of Hot Stone Rice or the proper name is Dolsot Bibimbap - Hot Stone Bowl with rice, vegetables, black fungus, seaweed and a dousing of hot bean paste.  Mix it all up with your silver spoon.
- Dessert - little pineapple-stuffed rambutans (like lychees); eat with toothpicks provided.

Ambience of the restaurant:  Small family-style restaurant.  Furniture possibly needs an update.  Needs more ventilation 'cos there's Korean BBQ and Hot Pot.

Price:  about $15/person for dinner

There is also lunch specials at this restaurant for $9.53 - beef or chicken, steamed rice, 2 spring rolls & soup.  Will try this out next time."}
{"text":"I first fell in love with this restaurant when I attended the high school across the street - their lunch specials were amazing (delicious, great value, and excellent price point). I recall the lunch specials being less than $8-9 back in the day. I went back yesterday since I had the day off from work, and was hopeful for the same nostalgic experience. The prices went up, the chicken and pork lunch specials were a bit over $12, while the beef lunch special was just over $13. Admittedly, I was a little bummed out by the new prices, but a price increase was to be expected.

The lunch special included a miso tofu soup and a plate that was filled with the following: pickled radish, lettuce salad, Korean sweet potatoes, 2 spring rolls, an ice-cream scoop sized rice, and the meat of your choice. Interestingly enough, the radish and salad were all placed underneath the meat so we had to dig around to get to it. We got the beef and chicken special, and everything tasted the same. The spring rolls were exactly the way I remembered it, and the chicken is still the best Korean marinated chicken I've tasted in town. The only thing that was disappointing were the potatoes, it was not saucy enough, and therefore not as sweet as I had remembered them to be. This made me really sad because I always thought Hankang had the best Korean potatoes in the city. We were in and out in less than an hour, so I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the NW and in need of a quick bite. The price makes me a bit hesitant since I recall lower price once upon a time but for the variety you get, not too shabby. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We tried the seafood pancake, chicken and the spicy tofu soup. Everything was just okay; the one dish that was good was the spicy tofu soup."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch combo. Was tasty.
Seems like they cater a lot to the students across the street.
Large portions."}
{"text":"Still the biggest fan from the first time I visited! My last review for Hankang was a few years ago and I haven't seen the owner...not sure if ownership has changed but if it has - it's still just as amazing. 

The lunch special is my all time favorite in the city! Such a good deal and you get a huge portion. I always order the short ribs! Their honey glazed potatoes are to die for."}
{"text":"I've been to Hankang a few times and its usually been quite good but the past few visits I've been very disappointed.  The food is just painfully bland.  The sides and mains are all just tasteless, even the supposed spicy ones.

Time to find a new place for my be bibimbap and japchea."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop shop with great authentic Korean. Would recommend!"}
