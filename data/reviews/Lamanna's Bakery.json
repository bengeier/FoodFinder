{"text":"the store is nice and spacious after the renovation however the service is still very slow. it's seems disorganized. I enjoy the pastries and continue to go back because they only 7 minutes away from me. The gelato is amazing but very expensive-that I will not buy again!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love! Can you tell how much I love this place? Lol I dream about their desserts especially their custard pastries! Mmm! Can't wait to try the hot food. Going there tmrw!"}
{"text":"Cakes and desserts are amazing. Not too sweet and made fresh at good prices."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place following the renovations. It is a gem within scarborough. I have been here a number of time. I really like their pastries, cookies and donuts. I had their eggplant and veal sandwiches, which were quite flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"I love the cannolis and pizza! I can't wait to try their coffee, gelato (coming soon) and other goodies!  The pizza was fresh, and came in a big portion. I loved the pepperoni, but I liked the vegetarian one even more.  I've never had a cannoli until now at Lemanna's (so I have nothing to compare it to), but I enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Solid 5/5! You wont believe you can find top notch quality in east scarborough! Ive been to many 5 stars hotels, and the pastry here feels like it came out of four season! I ate the lobster tail, not expensive at all 2.99. So many crunchy layers, as you eat towards the end the more layers it gets. Service is top notch too!! Bloody amazing, the environment and atmosphere is something you would find in a more high end shops, yet the price here is too incredible. I wouldnt mind paying mote for it. This place can secure a high end location in downtown without doubt."}
{"text":"We've bought multiple birthday cakes, pastries, entrees and coffees from this place. Glad to have it in our hood. It can get super busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"All the pastries we ordered were incredibly fresh and amazing. I can't stand soggy cannolis and this did not disappoint! We had cannolis, eclaires, tiramisu, and napoleon cake. Prices were reasonable as well. We also ordered a whole house made cheesecake at $26. I'll give it a 4/5. It was missing the vanilla flavor which I love so much. The place was under renovation and the line ups were pretty confusing. They have a hot order and pastry order counter. A few others were complaining about it as well. I didn't get service right away and was confused about where to stand, but hopefully once the reno is completed, it will become more organized. I'll definitely be revisiting this place!"}
{"text":"You can taste the freshness of the ingredients they use here.   My favourites here are the lobster tails and the lasagna.  To die for!! Friendly service and reasonably priced.   This will be a regular visit spot for me."}
{"text":"Good veal sandwich! & great desserts. Place is always busy. Great customer service. It would be nice to be able to buy a piece of cake instead of offering the whole cake. Best cannoli ever!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery. Cannolis are terrific and the cakes are beautiful. The pizza is tasty with a decent marinara.  The only thing is that I wish people wouldn't start lines all over the place when it gets super busy."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of selection.  A neighbourhood gem, creating a family warm and welcoming family atmosphere.  Line ups are less with the expansion, but still really busy at meal times! Servers are friendly and most helpful. This family run bakery is worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Lamanna's for lunch.  The food was very good and a great price.  However, for first time visitors it is very confusing.  When we walked in, there were three separate  busy lines with absolutely no signage as to what we were suppose to do.  The line on the right seemed to be picking up boxed cakes and coffee. We couldn't tell what the middle line was for but we could see the pasta etc. off to the left...so we lined up there.  When we arrived there were no empty seats, so after waiting in line about 10 minutes we saw a couple of free seat at the harvest style table.  We left the line to go put our coats on the chairs so we'd have a place to sit.  Then we had to line up again...when we finally got up to hot food counter we were told we needed 'a number'.  Really?  We left again and went to the front of the store looking for a number dispenser...nada.  Since we could not figure out how to get a number we went to the r line on the right (now the shortest line) to ask where to get a number.  That's when we found out that this was where we were suppose to go originally to  order and pay for our food...again there in signage stating this.   At this point every one that was in front of us were long gone however the lines were very busy.  We were both annoyed at this point and rather hungry but I have to admit the girl on the register was a gem and explained the set-up and apologized for it taking so long.  I guess it's a great spot when you know what to do but for first time visitors it's very confusing but as I said we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"New expansion  is great. The gelato is delicious and fairly priced, and always lots of new and exciting  flavours. The hot table is good too and I can't wait to try their pizza. Many beautiful desserts to choose from. Most of the ones I have tried have been good, but found the macarons  disappointing. Overall, nice atmosphere, lots of goodies to choose from- you can't go too wrong."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, however the service is VERY slow. I come here 2-3 times a week and there is always a line up -around 7-8 people ahead of me. I don't see more than 3 people serving and it normally takes me 30minutes to get in and out.   I always get a veal parmesan or chicken parmesan sandwich with cheese and mushrooms which costs about $7. If the food wasn't so good, I wouldn't voluntarily come back to spend most of my time waiting in line.   The servers are super nice and their almond cookies are delicious."}
{"text":"Great meals,  fantastic prices!!! Don't get me started about the awesome rice balls!!!  Sooooooo goooood!"}
{"text":"Superb cakes. Its our go to place when we want a good cake. It's a pain though at the counter because you have to ask about each cake to find out what is inside. Fix that and I'll give you a five. One of the few places around that sells the ten ounce glass bottles of Coke. I wish they were open a little later on the weekends."}
{"text":"Only place in Durham that serves good deserts. Pizza is good too. Only 3 stars because service here by 2-3 staff members are awful.  They weren't friendly at all."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for baked goods; love their fresh gelato; tasty hot table and sandwiches. It's the only bakery I go to for cakes and cheesecake. We also order large trays of chicken parmegiano and lasagna for big family gatherings. You just nees to order a few days ahead."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the decor is lovely. I always come here for their delicious pizza and lasagna, or whenever there's a birthday- I gravitate towards their yummy cakes!! I love everything about this place! They expanded their store, which is amazing because it has become so busy and popular in Scarborough. Definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Yum. Blessed are those (like myself) who live by this place and get to stop by frequently. This Italian bakery was renovated not too long ago so it has a great open atmosphere and they have regular meal options too like delish sandwiches, pasta, pizza, etc. I frequented for the strawberry cheesecakes but they don't have them as much anymore -- hence 4 stars."}
{"text":"Tried the lasagna, veal cuTlet sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs,and fungi pizza... All amazing!  Also had their gelato, can't go wrong with any of the flavors !"}
{"text":"Delicious Just find the ordering process a bit jumbled for hot food, as well as bakery it gets a bit chaotic, everything is great quality though."}
{"text":"The bakery items are always fresh and very affordable, they also have a large variety of items. The pizza is very unique for the area it reminds of New York style so if you are tired of chain pizza this is a great place."}
{"text":"Joined a friend for coffee. Even at 2:00, the room was very full of people eating lunch; the staff were too busy to wipe the tables or empty the garbage. They were still pleasant, though. The latte was very good, but I found the peach gelato cloyingly sweet. The high ceiling magnifies the sound of many conversations--not the best place for a quiet chat."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! You won't believe the size of one slice of pizza.  Amazing pastries and gelato!  Don't miss this fabulous restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good , the veal parm is a favourite of my family.very quick service. Good desserts although some are a bit tooo sweet for me. Some of the pastas are a bit oily and the veggies are mehhh ( and I really like veggies ). .. good if you want a quick dinner but still want a home cooked experience!"}
{"text":"Love their lasagna and carrot cake, fresh and a hit with everyone.  Would be a 5 star but the  ordering and payment is confusing for customers but everyone is friendly and helpful.  They are a go to for family gatherings."}
{"text":"Okay, so I need to give some background information. I've now come to this bakery 4 times, and I need to explain that I live in Toronto; it's close to 30km for me to drive to here. My husband and I discovered the infamous \"Lobster Tails\" when we were in Boston and when we found out there was a bakery near Toronto that made them we had to make the trek. So the first time we came, there were no Lobster Tails, I think we came early in the morning, 10ish I would say, so we tried an eclair and let me tell you, it was delicious. Flaky and truly amazing.   The second time we came, again no Lobster Tails but we tried something else, I think I remember lemon and something, again, very tasty. The third time we came, I think it was close to 4pm and there was a woman in front of us who had nabbed the last 3 Lobster Tails, we had been talking to her and we told her that we had driven to this bakery 3 times now and they never have any Lobster Tails; she gracious gave us one of her Lobster Tails (if you're on here, thanks again). My husband and I were really hoping it would be crap so we would never need to drive out here again, it was delicious, seriously so good. So you're wondering why the terrible rating right?  I went again this morning and they only had cakes in the pastry case. I asked about Lobster Tails and the woman said they didn't have any yet. I laughed, and asked if they had any kind of system because I've now come in 4 times and have only managed to get one, not one time, but literally one Lobster Tail; I would buy an entire box, if I could JUST FIND THEM. The woman didn't seem to understand me (perhaps a language barrier) so she asked another woman to help me. I again ask her, if there's a system, if there's a better time of day. The woman tells me they open at 9am but the case isn't full until close to 11am. What kind of bakery doesn't have a bunch of fresh baked pastries at opening?!!! At that point I was just so irritated, I left. I really want to like them, I've given them four chances but never again, I'm done.  I went to my car and went to yelp to look for an Italian Bakery in the area and found Ora Mangiamo in Pickering, less than 5 minutes down the road. It wasn't busy at all and the pastry case was full. Save yourself the grief and go there instead."}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery. I love the service, and all the food and beverages are incredibly fresh. Italian food is authentic, coffee is strong and delicious. Multiple visits are necessary because everything on their menu must be tried at least once. And a different dessert every time!"}
{"text":"Since I've been buying stuff regularly for the past few months...i think its time for some honest reviews! IAM NOT ITALIAN so I don't know what traditional italian food tastes like... PROS 1. Pastries and lasagna are the best  2. cheap and delicious 3. Service Is friendly  CONS  1. The taste of aluminum shows up on the lasagna! Would be nice if they start serving it in plastic containers 2. Sandwich are very questionable! They don't have a toaster... And the meat is cold... Doesn't matter if they serve chicken or veal... I honestly felt ripped off after having a sandwich 3. I do see they are renovating .. But there are very few seats to sit down and enjoy some coffee 4. Out of town ( it takes me 30 minutes just to get to this place but I do love returning home with a full box of pastries..."}
{"text":"This bakery is a old style Italian bakery that provides top quality baked and hot and cold fresh items.  Reasonable wait times and lots of staff to serve you.  Located east Toronto this restaurant has expanded their size and maintain the decor and quality.  Excellent place to get good Italian baked goods and gelato.  Highly recommended to visit on the east side Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Italian bakery in Scarborough! The place is always packed and the line up is usually out the door. They have a large variety of desserts, pastrys, food and gelatos for very reasonable prices. The service is always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Get the lobster tails! Overalls their pastries are very good. The only thing I haven't tried is their hot deli foods.  Their prices are little a little more but you get good quality. They don't open late so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great food and baked goods.  I always order the meat lasagna.  Very tasty and generous amount of meat.  For the price it's filling and satisfying.  Try the meatballs as well.  Tastes good.  Meaty and dense.   I've tried every pizza flavour they have.  Favourite is porchetta.  I get pizza at lunch and its always freshly, tasty and great quality ingredients.  For dessert, try the lobster tail and cannoli. Also, nutella and pistachio cream puffs are worth checking out.   Personally, I'd skip the gelato and donuts.    Service is very poor and lining up can be tricky. The servers are very slow and not friendly at all. I'd give this place a high rating but it is a shame they're lacking in the service department."}
{"text":"Had the most delicious tiramisu cake from there yesterday! I'll be buying tiramisu from there again. Also has a great selection of freshly baked Italian pastries with an espresso bar, and on the other side has a hot table section. It was busy on a Saturday afternoon, and on a Tuesday morning when it just opened, they already had quite a few customers there for their morning coffee fix."}
{"text":"Dropped by today and bought some pastries and lasagna, the cakes are sooooooo good! Especially the strawberry tart and fruit Napoleon (I'm not sure what exactly the name is), but they do make the BEST custard in scarborough! And also cannoli and lobster tail are both very nice. However, the lasagna is very disappointed since it become too soft and can't taste the layers.  I think the price is very fair as well, at least affordable for everyone.  This is a 4.5 and definitely will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you're looking for comfort food this is the spot. I've tried many items from the hot food section. The lasagna is my favourite and it definitely satisfies my cravings. Mind you this place gets extremely busy and sometimes they run out of food and you'll have to wait 15-30 mins until the new batch. I still think its worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Loved their baked goods. Would recommend others to try them at least onc."}
{"text":"This place has been around for some time now and only recently have I tried it which is quite sad since I live literally about 3-minutes down the street.  The place is very casual with a cafeteria type setting and a good amount of seating.    I have yet to try their food, though I've heard many good things about it.  One of my good friends, who is the human clone of Garfield (the cat) really enjoys their lasagna so that says a lot.  My mom too enjoys their lasagna and she's the hardest woman to please on Earth.  Another friend had recommended their popular pastry, the Lobster Tail and ohmahgoodniz... I'm pretty sure that God handmade this heavenly dessert or that perhaps God is actually Italian. Definitely a MUST when visiting Lamanna's Bakery. 5/5.   The Gelato too is a must try here.  I've only had their Hazelnut flavour but I'd go back just for that.  They have tons of other flavours so I'll update my review accordingly as I'm sure I'll be back for more. But for now, I'd still give their Gelato 5/5."}
{"text":"They're pizza is bomb, and the ravioli is too die for but the rum soaked cakes are legit rum soaked. I bought one and it was basically like taking a shot."}
{"text":"Really great pastries. My husband and I enjoyed the lobster tail, mocha cream puff, cannolis and Portuguese tarts. We had high hopes for the tiramisu cream puff but it didn't quite do it for us and I didn't like the eclair. My beef with this place is that apparently they don't take orders for Friday and Saturday which I think is completely nuts. When else do people do their celebrations?! I already had another bakery in mind...Francesca and I immediately headed over. They did a great job with my son's birthday cake."}
{"text":"i always pass by there on the way out to the burbs to visit my family (who grew up in t.o. but has a suburban affliction).  the lasagna is good, but the desserts are meh.  i don't think they are made in house.  we had a chocolate cake made for dessert for 10 it was awful.  too sweet, dry cake just terrible.    i wouldn't drive there for the lasagna, but if i was in the hood i would stop by for that.  price point is ok."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, I have no idea why I haven't thought to leave a review. The good is amazing, the dessert is amazing and the people are always nice. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place!! There's a reason it's usually always busy! I think the bakery is slightly better than the kitchen. However the must try is the rigatoni with meat gravy. I also think the staff are very friendly and helpful! I want to give it 4 and a half stars but yelp won't permit that lol."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to live near this Italian bakery.  The proof of Lamanna's success is that they are expanding and took over 1/2 of the Roger's store's space to expand.  there's always a line up, so if you are getting hot foods go straight to the back.  Hot foods are good here and so are the fresh baked twists.   Pro tip: order your hot foods first then cash out and order your baked good there."}
{"text":"All reviews are correct. GREAT food, with total chaos when ordering. I had the lasagna, cappuchino and cannoli, while my husband had the veal sandwich. I found this place to offer even better food than some bakeries I have been to in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I went here to grab a slice of pizza for lunch. It was very busy at lunch time with a line up and tables mostly full. I went in the pizza line up as they had others too.  My husband and I ordered the 5 cheese slice and one veggi slice of pizza. We ended up not loving it as the cheese one was wayyy too much cheese and the veggie one was just okay. The slice of pizza is pretty big, so can fill you up. I think others may love it but for me I would rather just go to pizza nova!"}
{"text":"A real gem in Scarborough....with authentic Italian food.  Great to grab pizza slices while on the go or order take-out pasta dishes for the family. The dessert counter is mind blowing with the array of cakes, cupcakes, cookies & gelato.  All the portions are very generous.  Love the espresso and lattes. My only wish is that they were opened later so I can visit more often."}
{"text":"Came by during lunch on Sunday to order their huge slice of pizza. We waited about 20 minutes. While waiting, we people watched and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of this place.  Brought the pizza home to eat and can I say how delicious it was! Their homemade pizza sauce was so refreshing and had a nice sweetness to it. Their pepperoni had a zing to it and they seriously load up on the cheese! The crust was good but was super thick on one side so it was a bite of a mouthful. Nonetheless, we (obviously) couldn't finish the pizza so ate it a couple of days later (cold) and it was still delicious!   We paid almost $25 for the pizza which is equivalent to roughly an XL which is expensive. I probably wouldn't get it again but I will definitely come back to try their other pizza!"}
{"text":"Best lasagna I had. For under $10, you can get your tummy fill. Pochetta is available only Friday in a bun or on a plate"}
{"text":"VERY good food with crazy customer service. By crazy I mean all over the place, literally and metaphorically. As I'm sure every other review has stated, there is no obvious system as to how to order at this place. There are three registers which all take orders for anything in the store, but when the girls are in a bad mood they will tell you you have to order from the one they are not standing at. It's still worth it though. Try to avoid peek times which are from 11:30-1:30 and Fridays are just a write off. The lasagna is their best dish, it's huge and homemade. But everything is a close second. The pizzas throw a lot of people because they want a basic pepperoni and cheese, but the pizza dude has some actual taste and puts some really authentic Italian ingredients together. The pastry's and cakes are flawless but pricey. I know a few other places in Scarborough where you can get near the same quality for much cheaper."}
{"text":"My go to bakery for cakes (chocolate cakes specifically). Also love their individual dessert selections specially the ones with custard (not sure of the names but they are usually topped off with fruits. One is custard with sponge cake, he other is puff pastry). Canollis are ok but lobster tails are the best here. Gets busy during the weekends and rush hour weekdays."}
{"text":"Great place from decor to service. Always busy. The only issue is parking and the huge line ups. Expect to wait most days."}
{"text":"Have only had the desserts here. Always taste fresh. Only complaint is the service is a bit slow. Next time going to try the pizza and pastas. They looked great"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in east Scarborough! Home made gelato, excellent coffee, pastries and cakes, cookies to die for. Yummy hot table and fresh inventive pizzas made all day long. A real treasure. No need to go into the city for Italian heaven."}
{"text":"Local Italian bakery that's very popular. Love the owners and love the atmosphere. Food and dessert are great for it's price but definitely not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love their Lasagna and pastries. Service is top notch, friendly people and always polite. The owner and the family are very helpful and so nice, regardless how busy the store is."}
{"text":"Had the BIG slice of pizza!!! Absolutely delicious.. will definitely be back! Staff was very helpful and courteous!"}
{"text":"Two words for you LOBSTER TAILS. Flaky, crunchy and an amazing filling.  I would have taken a picture for you of the food but I ate it too fast. The lobster tail is perfection- flaky, crunchy and crisp and a perfect filling that was slightly sweet. I will be visiting again for this.  I went on a Friday afternoon- it was busy and there was a quick moving line. Many people picking up ordered cakes, pastries. I tried the lobster tails, and the chocolate and dulce de leche eclairs which were total wins! The chai latte was good as was the affagato with a chocolate gelato!   Do keep the pastries in the fridge if you're saving them for the day. But it's truly a good quality bakery.  YUM!! Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"Best lasagna I've ever had hands down, they also include bread with it  The pizza is massive one slice is like 2  The sandwiches can be pricey as you add cheese and other stuff but buy is it good,  also make sure to ask to see the bun before specifying which you want insider tip  Baked cakes are amazing moist.   Espresso is strong and very rich thick bodied, I think they use dark roast beans.  Pretty much everything they have is amazing but the lasagna is the staple in my opinion"}
{"text":"I've been going to Lamanna's bakery since the beginning.  Love the pizza! the smoked provolone with mushroom is probably the best pizza I ever had.  Pastries and cakes are amazing.  It's nice that you could dine in now after the renovation.    Cannoli on point"}
{"text":"Lasagna is amazing as well as the sandwiches.  A bit pricey but worth the authenticity!  Try the cannolis!  A must!  Expect line ups."}
{"text":"I love this place!  One of the top two or three Italian bakeries in the city (or not-quite-in-the-city, I guess).  As others have suggested, you cannot visit this place without some cream-filled lobster tail pastries, I also love their tiny Portuguese custard tarts, mini pecan-pie tarts, but especially the delicious pizza slices and meatball sandwiches, with hot peppers and provolone!  There's always something interesting in the hot table, like teardrop-shaped arancini, or meat lasagna, and what's more perfect with sweet Italian pastries than a nice espresso or latte?  First order your hot food from the cash register on the west side?left?of the store, then line up on the?right?east side of the store to select your baked goods and pastries, while they prepare the hot food, for maximum efficiency.  There's usually a line up, but it moves quickly because there's lots of staff to help, and it's all worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I swear those cannolis keep calling my name and it's the main reason I keep coming back. Luckily they are doing renovations to expand the bakery as it's pretty tight in here. They gave a deli and hot section with amazing lasagna. They have a great selection of desserts but I wish they would label what they all are as they seem to get annoyed when you ask what's inside. Well how else am I supposed to know? Their cakes are very fresh though. And their ricotta cannolis are perfection. They have chocolate ones too but the ricotta is way better. This place is always busy. And the lineup gets confusing so people are always cutting in front and it gets annoying. Definitely try to avoid going during high peak hours, especially when they're about to close. Holidays like mother's day is another nightmare too. Hopefully with the renovations it'll bring some order in there. But must must go for the desserts and food. It can be a bit pricy but you are paying for quality"}
{"text":"Found out about this spot when I googled Tiramisu cheesecake. Although they didn't carry it, the had a WIDE variety of other pastries that I will be trying. I purchase the Lasagna, which was good, along with the hazelnut cannoli to start. Definitely will be going back (tomorrow) lol"}
{"text":"Delicious cakes and desserts. Prices are reasonable given you are bound to impress or be impressed with your choice. Good lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bakeries. Amazing coffee, spectacular pastries, gelato is to die for and don't even get me started on their pizza! I stop by every single time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"While the staff was friendly, the service was poor. It took 15 mins while being served and another 10-15 standing in line. They box up the pastries very nicely however they take forever. The food and bakery section look amazing but the place is brought down by slow service."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing. All of it! I always come back craving something! The hot table is fabulous as are the desserts.   However. The ordering system is confusing and not streamlined. It's nuts sometimes, and it is not because it is busy, but rather because of the random ways they have you purchase items. For example you must purchase hot food items at the deli or bakery. Okay - but the hot menu is not at those spots ... So you neeed to fight through the crowd waiting for their orders at the hot table just to look and see what the menu is and what they have available that day .... Then you have to go back and join the proper line ... That is now 3-4 people longer than when you entered."}
{"text":"Lamanna's has great food and baked goods. Many times I've just run in for lasagna slices (on those \"no time to cook\" nights). I have used their catering services in the past and have been satisfied with the selection, quality and quantity. They are not a nut free facility so I can't always get their cakes (as we have relatives with nut allergies) but when I am able to, they never disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough. The hot table always has something great, my favorites are the lasagna (meat or veggie, both fantastic), the rice balls, and porchetta (which is only served on Fridays but worth the wait because it is amazing!). They also serve stone-baked authentic pizza pies, the toppings do change daily but I always find one I like. The pastries are always amazing, you can get small one-serving desserts or buy cakes & pies to take home. Coffee is superb, gelato is served in the warm months.  Two negative points: 1.hours are short, they close at 6 PM Tuesday to Saturday and 3 PM on Sundays. They are NOT open Mondays. Keep in mind though this is a family owned place. 2.the ordering system is very confusing. There are two cashiers which take all orders, plus a separate line up for the hot table. First-timers will get very confused by this system"}
{"text":"Terric lobster tails and croissants!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Lamanna's for a few years and I have never been disappointed with the with the quality of the food. The lasagna is always a big hit with our guess.  The pastries are totally amazing."}
{"text":"Where do I start this place is awesome!!! The lasagna is just delicious and the pizza if you like the za with a home made taste this is the place. I always go back"}
{"text":"Cute fresh bakery cafe for a quick bite or takeout! A great variety of italian pizza, pasta, lasagna & veal chicken sandwiches. Their sweets bakery is amazing as well! The only downfall was we found a piece of blonde hair inside the veal chicken sandwich which was a little upsetting."}
{"text":"Love the bakery. Love the food even more. Hate the service.   My first time coming here, I decide to order a simple gelato. My server, who is quite nice, tells me to wait by the side to be served. However, ten minutes later, I still haven't been served. With the feeling that she must've forgotten (even though im right there in front of her), I ask if I can be served. \"Oh of course, just a moment.\" Five mintues pass, and I'm a little annoyed for having to wait fifteen minutes for a scoop of gelato. A new customer goes up to the counter, and orders gelato. The server, still the same girl, says, \"Oh of course.\" IMMEDIATLEY, this girl be sprinting to that gelato bar, scooping up this lady's ice cream like its nobody's business.  \"Um, excuse me, could I get my gelato as well?\"  \"Oh of course, just a moment.\""}
{"text":"Try their cannoli and lobster tails you will not be disappointed!!! By far the best bakery I have been to in Scarborough. The servers are extremely courteous and fast. Even with a big line up I was in and out of there within 15 minutes. A bakery that's definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Tl;dr: great flavour, very reasonable prices, I recommend the meatball sandwich and gelato.  This restaurant/bakery resides on the very border of Pickering in Scarborough. I came here for a Friday lunch and it was quite busy. The seating area holds about 35 people.  Today we tried the lasagna, porchetta on a bun, veal cutlet sandwich, and meatball sandwich. We got all 4 dishes for about $37 which includes tax and the extra toppings we got on a few sandwiches.  I started off with the porchetta. The filling for the sandwich was very rich and creamy. I expected some crunchy notes but there weren't any. It did have the very porky, salty and spicy flavors I wanted though. I highly recommend it if you feel like indulging.  Next was the veal. We paid extra for it to be topped with some peppers. It was pretty good. It didn't stand out as much as the other dishes though.  After that was the lasagna. It is a pretty generous serving, with at least 6 layers of noodles I think. It wasn't over the top in meat or cheese, just classic, tasty lasagna. It came with a bun on the side.  Lastly I ate the 3 meatball sandwich with mushrooms and peppers. Even though was my last dish and i was already stuffed, this ended up being my favorite. The meatballs were meaty and flavourful. The sandwich wasn't flooded in sauce, but the taste of sauce really shone through. And they were very generous with the extra topping we ordered.  We capped off the meal with gelato and lattes. The gelato was rich and creamy, a suitable end to an indulgent meal. I got the coconut and hazelnut. The coconut was good, but the hazelnut was amazing. The lattes were also good, but I admittedly usually get very sweetened coffee from Starbucks.  Overall, incredible restaurant and i recommend anyone passing through to stop by.  Next time I will try the pastries and other desserts."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area my whole life (21 years!) and I only recently discovered this place which really is a shame because I've been missing out! As soon as you walk in you will want to just buy everything you see it just smells and looks amazing in here.   I typically go to grab my Saturday morning coffee along with  a dessert and out of everything I've tried I've never had one bad experience."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a weekday afternoon to try a couple of their pastries.  Got a lobster tail and a lemon roll.  Generally their pastries looked fresh and good and the prices are fair. However, there were a lot of cakes in the case without labels and I'm guessing they were waiting for pickup. Wasn't fun to see them and not be able to try them nor know what kind of cakes they are, so it would be nice if they give people the options to purchase pieces to try.  Back to my purchase. The lobster tail, it was humongous with a nice crunchy shell and a very generous amount of filling. I personally find it a bit heavy and you may want to share with 1 or 2 other people. Lemon cake tasted a bit artificial to me and wasn't anything special.  Service was ok. Staff's attitude seems alright but speed was very slow. We waited almost 5 min by the case before we were served.  I took a look at some ham sandwich these ladies bought and was eating there. Doesn't look special either, just a bun with a couple pieces of pastrami?? Looks dry with no other apparent cheese or condiments.  Overall, I guess it would be ok to come if you are close by. Their other items such as cheesecake and cannoli might be good. But coming from 2 highway exits away, the products I've tried today wasn't special enough for me to make my way back here again."}
{"text":"This place is great and the food is awesome!  There are only two things I wish: 1)It was so busy I wish it was bigger with more seating 2)I wish the lasagna had ricotta, but that is just my personal preference for lasagna. It was still awesome.  This place is a great bang for your buck! Side note; I read that they have a gelato station but I did not see it while I was there!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and check out this place.  So far their cake is excellent and also the pizza slices.    Newly renovated,  communal tables, casual but chic."}
{"text":"I stopped by post renovation.  The store is a lot bigger and now has a seating area.  The set-up is a little off - one cash for the deli and pizza slices and two shared cashiers for the deserts and hot plate items.    I ordered the veal parma on kaiser and two sections of lasagna to go.  The wife and daughter really enjoyed the lasagna. The veal was just as good as I have had at the St. Lawrence Market.  Since this review   We have found the pizzas here to be amazing.  The slices are generous and the range of styles from veggie, to cheese & pepperoni, to salami & mushrooms are delicious.  We have even ordered whole pizzas for get togethers and even picky eaters enjoyed a slice.  My personal favourite slices: vegetarian; Quattro Cheese and the provalone, sun dried tomatoes and salami."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Friday. The parking lot was a nightmare. Walking in was overwhelming. People were all over and it's not really clear where you're supposed to go. I saw various lines then groups of people standing around by counters. One sign said line up here, so I did. Turns out that was the line for the dessert counter. Very confusing.  Finally got to the till and decided on pizza. Something simple. Slice of pizza and a water $5.30. I went to find a spot to sit at while I was waiting for my cousin. She was getting lasagna. It felt like a long wait for hers. Tables are limited. Lots of people take theirs to go. The coffee area looked good but I didn't get one. Would I return? Probably."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Lamanna's 4 times in the past. I live in the neighbourhood and they opened a few years ago. They are so popular there is usually a line up. The serving staff at the hot food counter have seemed either stressed, or awkward handling food. Maybe I was here when new staff were working or just at busy times. They close at 6pm daily I think. That could cause some rushing because they close so early.  There is a.big nice peasant table in the middle of the room with 12 chairs.  Ordering food was awkward with the system I used for the first time. You can't see the food you're paying for because you pay BEFORE you get your food. There are 3 cash registers in this one room! 1 for pizza, and 2 for baked goods. So yu have to butt in front of people getting served to see what the food looks like before you decide what to order. When you pay they give you a number.   The lasagne was cheesy with ample meat and sauce but there seemed to be no salt or garlic. The sauce was a little sweet (and thin). I looked all over for salt but there wasn't any. A man talso tried to help me find salt but no luck.  My meatball sandwich (3 ample meatballs ) was imposible to eat because the server sliced the bun thin on top and thick on bottom. I paid extra for mushrooms. They had no taste at all. Were from a can I'm pretty sure. So everything fell out of the sandwich which I ate 1/2 of it worth a knife and fork. The meatballs had a little basil but no garlic or salt again and lacked flavour. The consistency eas good though. One unforgiveable thing was the meat was very pink and undercooked in one of the meatballs! I posted a photo.   I don't think I'll eat here again... but maybe for pizza slice ..... they looked good but a little dried out from sitting.  All this place needs is a few tweaks mostly to.improve their product.  Today I had 2 items."}
{"text":"The lasagne deserves 5 stars. The line-up system deserves 1 star, in my opinion.   It is difficult to know where to line up. They need some signs! Or a \"take your number\" system.  And why is the bread queue right in the middle of the sweets line-up and the deli queue, and it's not really clear where you should line up if you want to order hot food to go?  It's possible to just stand there for a while, thinking that you are lining up to buy, for example, a frozen lasagne. As you stand there, with your fingers beginning to turn numb because of the chill of the lasagne, you realize that, after all, you were not in any line at all. You step up to the cash, a chorus of irate customers berate you for cutting the line. Surely, a few tweaks with signs or cordoned areas could fix this!!  Some other line-up plans spring to mind, for example, in some of the Italian Bakeries in Etobicoke (examples: LaRose, TreRose) have designed European line up systems which function cleanly and smoothly. You leave Lamanna's tasting the ashes of a one-star line-up experience (like Soviet flashback). However, the sun rises when you arrive home and eat your 5 star lasagne. The food is brilliant. Note: I've been there three times. The first time, I fled in panic after the irate customer chorus. But I tried again: the food is very good."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian bakery I've ever been to...everything on the menu from the sandwiches to the hot drinks to the gelatos have been on point! I have a friend who everytime our small group goes there, he always mention how the bread is......I can't even copy everything he says...but yeah; I truly recommend it if you are In the Scarborough/Pickering area"}
{"text":"For this area of town, it's probably close to a highlight for local residence and workers. The doors here are constantly being opened and for good reason. The Veal Sandwich was priced at $4.99, toppings extra.   The Elektra Espresso Machine made Italian Espresso beverages although it can take some time as multiple staff serve multiple guest with a single register. Confusion can occur at times.  As my friend was occupied with a mouthful of Individual 2-bite Cake/Pastry and Latte, I looked up at the large LCD with a Soccer game on while enjoying my Italian roast Cappuccino.   Raspberry White Chocolate Cheese Cake($1.49) was presented like a Soft-serve which will attract many. The Tiramisu($1.29) was not my favourite as it was somewhat overpowered with Cocoa Powder. The sizes do make it easy to be excited as it means you get to try a few without overspending.   Typical Italian style Bakery/Bistro meant you can grab some Bread, Olive Oil, Pasta Sauce, Balsamic Vinegar, Dried Pasta, Hot Table items. What sets the mood here is the Vespa and the Soccer theme."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bakery east of Toronto. From cannoli's to lasagna to pizza....everything is magnificent! Great quality ingredients - it is evident that they don't cut corners. Staff is friendly and pricing is surprisingly low. Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"Miss this place  Again this is a place where when I was living in Highland Creek that I frequented  The hot menu is delish  Chicken or veal sandwiches are definitely something to order for a lunchtime bite  Baking is yummy  Cannolis you cannot go wrong  But the kicker is the Sfoya cake..... Never tried it till I met my wife  Now it's my favorite cake!!!!  Nice that they expanded the place  Will have to pop in again!!!"}
{"text":"Super packed on a Sunday! Barely any seats and my boyfriend and I had to share a chair.  I heard about this place from their advertised giant pizza slice. We went there to try it but they only had regular sized slices so I guess you have to order in advance or something.  Weird that the pizza wasn't heated up! It was just room temperature...so eh, not the best.  Amazing variety of food though. From pizza, lasagna, to pastries, gelato and specialty items for sale.  Think I'd come on a weekday so it's less busy and I can actually see what's in the display cases."}
{"text":"Five stars all around! Beautiful cake designs, amazing pizzas, lasagna yes please! Anything we've tried from the bakery has been incredible. Friendly staff who clearly love being there and are passionate about the food. Have not yet tried their gelato but the flavours look incredible. It is a beautiful shop and I am always glad to see how busy they are, lets me know they'll be around a long time! I have waited 20 minutes in line for the bakery before at Easter and would do it again for those delicious pastries. Cannoli's are a must and my absolute favourite is the lobster tail, the pastry cream is just perfect and the crunchy pastry shell is so light and flaky. I'm drooling just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Mmm. Had two slices of pizza (or well, two halves of two different slices of pizza). My brother brought them home for me and I put them back into the oven to reheat. When I put them in, they were connected. When I tried to pull them out as one piece, they separated. THE CHEESE MADE THOSE LOVELY MELTY CHEESE STRINGS. When was the last time you saw a pizza that did that? I can tell you that it's highly uncommon in my experience (I clearly don't eat good pizza enough). One of the two slices was mushroom and onion. The other was hot peppers, green olives and some kind of deli meat. Both were very good. I'd get them again."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery-- everything tastes sooo good. Must try the lobster tail roll and their lasagna. :)"}
{"text":"I knew was a fan as soon as I walked into Lamanna's. Just by looking at the all mouth-watering food and baked goods, I was already impressed. The fact that this place is always packed with people further reinforces Lamanna's as a popular option. This place is awesome and I would gladly recommend to anyone who is a fan of good Italian food. However, I think experiences here can vary in terms of customer service. More on that later.    The vibe of this place gives off a classical, quaint yet modern feeling with plenty of Italian food items on shelves, in a clean simplistic manner. Ordering is a bit confusing I would have to admit as you can order anything from any cashier and the fact that there's just so many people, the lines can be a jumbled mess.   There's so many food here I wanted to try everything but I ended up going for their meat lasagna, meatball, and their gelato and was really impressed with their food. Their lasagna was huge and is a great value. There was plenty of cheese, sauce, and meat, and I counted around 10 layers of pasta alone. Their meatball was also delicious and you could taste the complexity of it. To pair with the meal, I had a Chinotto which tasted  like a coke with a bitter aftertaste. It was definitely interesting.   I had their pistachio gelato and thought it was as good, if not better than the gelato I had in multiple places in Italy! It was just super creamy and rich, and the texture was wonderful. In a previous visit I had some of their cheesecake and it was really good as well.   Okay now, I came with three friends and we all ordered the meat lasagna and all the orders in front of us also ordered it so it was going like hotcakes. I got the last piece in the tray, while one of my friends was offered the vegetarian one and the order decided to wait for a new batch. He waited over 20 minutes just to be told he had to wait another 10 minutes, by then he just decided to get the vegetarian one. I guess it's fine if you're willing to wait as the food is fantastic after all.   I'll definitely come back to try the rest of their items and I have no doubt they are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I've had the lasagna, veal sandwich, macarons, various pastries, gelato, and espresso -- all delicious.  I'm giving them four stars because I agree with the other reviewers -- the ordering system for food makes no sense.  Now that I understand it I have no problems.  Unfortunately, when I'm there I see many confused patrons that I end up having to explain the system to.  Why not just implement a better, more sane ordering system?  It's been this way for years and I really don't understand why."}
{"text":"I randomly met a lady who told me she drove 30 mins for a cannoli. She didn't buy a box she bought one. I went in to see what she really drove that far for and to only leave with one. I went inside and this place is magical! I live 2 mins away and never knew this gem was tucked into this corner. I ended up leaving with pizza lasagna, cupcakes, and cookies on my first visit. It has been my go to spot ever since. I love this place! Thank u kind stranger for introducing me to this beautiful place"}
{"text":"A little disorganized but really good Italian sandwiches.  Generous size gelato.  Very busy lunches so go off times."}
{"text":"Very modern, many tables to dine in, reasonable price, and most importantly, good food!  I have tried one of their pizza slices (forgot the name, but it was pesto based. The highlight of that pizza was the crust! def. recommend), meat lasagna (tomato sauce was on point. it was OK, nothing too special about it), and lobster tail (dessert pastry, filled with generous amount of custard-y cream. The best item I had from this bakery).  There were customers coming in constantly which is a good sign. I recommend this place for people going to Rouge park or near the area. I still think Sanremo is the best Italian bakery in GTA."}
{"text":"\"Best place of all time. Their lasagna is to die for and their pastries are amazing\"- my little brother.   He took my phone and asked to make this review because he loves this place THAT much. It's a cute little cafe/restaurant place with about 5 counters.  First counter has coffee, espresso, & other hot beverages. Next to that counter is the gelato (with 2 displays worth of gelato, many delicious flavors).  The 3rd counter has their cake and pastries (i've had their red velvet cupcake, its amazing) The fourth counter is where the hot food is, think pastas, lasagna (which my little brother can't live without), chicken, beef, etc.  The fifth counter is their pizza station, assorted kinds. My fiance has had their Hawaiian-type pizza, he liked it. I had their white pizza and it was good. Thin crust, pretty big slices too.  In the middle of the cafe they have bench style seating, as well as tables along the wall.   It's not that big, and they're pretty busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I am always so hesitant to give a less than 5 star review to a restaurant/cafe I visit often, and I find myself at Lamanna's Bakery almost weekly. However, in the last few months I have noticed a definite decline in the cake quality. Sadly, other than our family fave: strawberry messy cake, I will not be buying any more cakes from here.  Onto their food. Okay, the lasagna & rice balls are outstanding/memorable/won't look at a lasagna the same way again.  However, the service & process is so agonizingly slow & disorganized that I have found we are starting to skip this place for dinner more & more. Just to clarify: this is not a restaurant.  You walk up to a counter and point to the food you want from a selection of foods already prepared, they wrap it up & off you go. Simple, eh? Well this process can take well over 15 minutes and I can't seem to understand why. 1 cash? Only one server who is responsible for preparing everything & cashing you out?  I don't get it. There is also a lot of confusion over bakery/hot counter line ups, ordering & cashing out. Unfortunately the result is a strange, silent chaos where patrons mill & stumble around trying to figure it out themselves. A tip: if you get hot food you magically skip to the front of the bakery line to pay. Ya, it's awkward but it beats waiting!!   Anyway, enough venting! Food = amazers. Dessert = only trust single serve desserts & service = see above.  Ps. I hear they're expanding, so these problems may just resolve themselves! (let's hope) Pps. The staff are actually quite nice and you can tell they are totally overwhelmed with the wall of people demanding fresh lasagna & cannolis at dinner time!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lamanna's way too many times to count - I am sure that my waistline could shed a little light on this little situation.   The bakery itself is cute and welcoming. During three of my visits here, it was pretty much a hang out for senior Italian men caught up in a serious discussion about the purity of the cannolis, perhaps.   Lamanna's preps a mean espresso with a punch, but the piece de resistance is their stream of pastries. Well executed, delicious, and photogenic. I've packed a box of various tiny pastries for one of my friends and they looked so scrumptious in the box. It took every ounce of my will-power to resist the temptation.   Pastries to try according to yours truly: Cannolis Tiramisu Cheesecake Lobster Tail Random assortment of mini biscotti and cookies  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"It is a Family owned Italian bakery they have one of the best cannolis In GTA, line ups are long on weekend best time is to come during weekdays."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday after watching that BlogTo video about the gigantic pizza slice for one.  The pizza slice takes about 30 minutes to make. It costs $21.99+tax. It tastes AWESOME might I add (as pizza should). I ordered that with a hot chocolate on the side. It was more chocolate-y than sweet, and a bit rich for my liking. Some whipped cream could have easily done away with that and made a nice balance/  I can't give this place a 5 simply because of the setup of the interior. I appreciate how they have two cashiers going, one on each side. Everything in the bakery is split. Food/pasta/pizza is ordered on the left when you go inside, and baked goods, hot drinks on the right. The problem is, for people who want both, they don't know which line to stand in (and it can get quite chaotic, especially during a busy time, like when I went). BEFORE YOU GO: look at what you want to order. The cashier on the baked goods side told me that depending on the size of the line, your entire order (food and drink) can be placed solely at one cash. There's no signage to explain that particular rule, though."}
{"text":"When I feel for real pizza I come to Lamanna's!!! I can't only speak on the pizza and some of the desserts. Their desserts are delicious and there are sooooo many to choose from. Their pizza is my fav!!!"}
{"text":"YES!!! Exactly what I've been looking for and I would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone! Though honestly, doesn't seem like there's anyone who doesn't know about this spot already haha! It's always packed when I go and well worth the wait!  Food, service, pastries are all amazing! The only bump is the plaza parking can be really difficult since it's a small lot and there's not always a space to eat in. Luckily, most people grab to go so just be patient for a spot :) I would say though that the bakery is a bit confusing. There's two separate lines for the hot food and the pastries (makes sense) but it isn't executed in a way that is easy to understand. Sometimes they just have crowds of people in the wrong place. I would recommend they rethink their design and maybe invest in some stanchions to help separate the lines and crowds. Anyway.. ONTO FOOD!  I always get the meat lasagna. It's such a hearty meal and you can see all the different layers. I think there's about 9-10 layers at least and each layer is visibly appealing and delicious. The lasagna is heated all the way through and the sauce and cheese are always just enough without drowning the whole thing. The portion is massive. I always end up taking half to go. The flavours of the sauce are fresh and you can taste different layers to it, so it's not just some basic tomato sauce.   We've tried the pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs before. I would say it's delicious but can't take me away from that delish lasagna.   Don't leave without grabbing a pastry to go! I've tried the famous lobster tail (cream inside what looks like a puff pastry croissant). It's yummy but I think I much prefer the more complex desserts. I love the cannoli's. The shell isn't too thick and they keep the filling minimal. They've got an assortment of eclairs which are too sweet for me but the hazelnut is something you gotta try atleast once.  Don't skip the gelato bar! Tons of flavours to choose from. and they always seem to give a big portion. :)  Staff have always been efficient and friendly enough considering that they're working really fast and don't exactly have time to smile and chat.   I am in Pickering once a week and this is 1 out of 2 spots I would go every single week. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic Italian Bakery? You've found it. I absolutely love Lamanna's. It's been around for awhile and it's owned by an Italian family.  Whenever I walk in, there's always a group of older Italian men drinking espresso and just chatting (old school feels). They have everything here from cakes, pastries, espresso, gelato, sandwiches and an Italian hot table. I think I've tried everything here except the coffee - the almond croissant has to be my favorite. I love the cakes, not too sweet and super moist. I always get two for birthdays. The Ice Cream sandwich is pretty tasty, made with fresh cookies and gelato. The newest creation is the giant slice of pizza! It's a cute gimic and very tasty. I also like their sandwiches, mortadella and salami with gardinere.   The one thing that I'm not a fan of is the operating hours, I wish they opened up earlier then 9am. It also gets very busy especially on weekends - so be prepared to wait!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Overrated IMO. Lamanna's is a legend around here, and it's just OK. On the bakery side, I've tried Portuguese custard tarts (soggy crust), some sort of sugary little cake that looks like a beautiful peach but is bone dry, cream horn (OK but unremarkable). On the lunch side, lasagna was under seasoned, arancini likewise bland and too much rice/not enough filling, tomato sauce (which should be spectacular) lacks flavour, pasta with olive oil, spinach and sun dried tomatoes unremarkable. Cheese pizza was delicious but reeealllly salty. (Maybe that's where all the seasoning from the other dishes went?) People rave about this place and it's always busy. I'm going to try it again, but thus far, meh. Just average.  OK, just returned from second visit. The veal and spaghetti was quite good, and the macarons were delish! Lasagna was better with some extra sauce and the baguette was good too. Really depends what you have, I guess. Will have to try the Gelato next time."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian bakeries I've been to in Toronto. Pretty much all their pastries are amazing - very authentic and quality ingredients used. My favourites are the eclairs, lemon tart, tiramisu and their amaretti. The hot table is great as well - try the meat lasagna, veggie penne  or potato pizza. Always long line ups here during lunch hour! If you're only ordering from the hot menu, you can order that at the cashier on the left to avoid the pastry line."}
{"text":"Pizza is 12/10, would eat again many more times. The tomato sauce on the pizza - my slice also had whole black olives, long slices of sopressata and banana peppers - was in the top 5 I've ever had. Busy place but the turnover is quick so you should be able to find a seat. Amazing desserts. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for several years to get pastry whenever making the trek DT was not possible.  Casual joint that serves a variety of Italian food.  Most come for takeout as it's not really a restaurant style place.  You order your food at the different counters and find your own seat after picking up your order.  Good selection of pastries that taste decent at a good price point.  They also have a salumi, pizza, hot food and coffee counter.  Thin crust pizzas with good quality toppings.  Baristas at the coffee counter knows what they are doing.  Hot food serves your typical pasta and veal sandwiches.  Overall an average place for Italian food.  My one issue with Lamanna's is their service.  They have the worst customer service EVER.  I've been here plenty of times and not ONCE have I experienced or seen decent customer service.  They are rude and impatient when taking your order.  Getting annoyed at you as you tell them which item you want.  It's like they can't be bothered with your business and just want to get you out of there.  I do not appreciate the undeserved attitude.  The three star is for the food but they do not deserve a star for their customer service.  I'll be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza , hot table, pastries and gelato!  My only request is that you stay open later in the summer for Gelato nights;)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Italian bakery, hands down. The staff are absolutely amazing and so friendly, and the food.. oh my goodness, I have not had a single thing that does not make my jaw drop. My personal favourites are the pizza, because who doesn't like a huge perfectly baked slice of hot pizza?! They do an incredible job of offering different flavours throughout the week, and there is always a good selection. I also highly recommend their sandwiches, they are all made fresh and sliced and piled right in front of you. Also the lasagna, it is so cheesy and melt in your mouth tender. Heck, just get everything! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Lamanna's is sort of on the border between Scarborough and Pickering. It's a bit out of the way for most, but it's worth the drive via the highway 401 if you want some great baked goods and Italian faves. I like to consider this establishment \"Italian-Canadian\" rather than just \"Italian\" because they offer more than a typical Italian bakery, such as cupcakes. Their sugar twist donut is amazing, with lots of fluffiness and a bit of lemon zest flavouring. Their pizza is good, and they have that giant pizza slice thing that can be shared with 3-4 people. The facility is on the small side for a place that gets a lot of customers (it is usually packed), so I hope that they expand some more. Lamanna's is a great place for take-out as well, to bring the taste back home. Best \"Italian-Canadian\" bakery out there! :)"}
{"text":"Ok so this place was recently featured in Blog.TO and their pictures looked insane - so I had to check it out for myself. I went twice in one week (and it's completely out of the way - but hey! Life's short so make the journey).   Decor: this place has been properly designed and boasts seating, organized queues (on the weekend), a numbering system, and great friendly service.   Food: Oh my. It's amazing. On the right side of the restaurant you'll find an espresso bar and all of their handcrafted delicious desserts. At the back, is their hot plate style dishes. Lasagne, spaghetti, veal and chicken cutlets, meat balls, the list goes on.   On the left side is their deli and cheese section and well as their PIZZA'S! Their pizza's are incredible.   Just go and taste for yourself. Come here starving, order tons and enjoy to you hearts content!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I want to like it more than I do but I have to rate it based on my experiences.  The food is good and the portions are very generous, same as my previous review. Unfortunately, I found their ordering system even more annoying this time and I wasn't the only one with that sentiment. There are no clear directions telling guests to order and pay at the cashier and then wait for their number to be called. There is no menu at either cashier, only at the back of the restaurant.  I ordered the veal cutlet with mushrooms and an arancini. I was pleasantly surprised when I received one and a half pieces of veal. Did I look hungry? The mushrooms were from a can and the portion was more than what you'd find in a regular sized can. For 75 cents, maybe I should buy all my mushrooms here.  The monstrous arancini (rice ball) was as big as my fist (I wear size XL gloves)! It was served on its own plate and covered in tomato sauce. Cutting into it revealed a stuffing of meat and cheese. On another day, an arancini and a salad would have been a very adequate meal. Hmmm, I don't recall seeing any salad on the menu. Unfortunately, the middle of the arancini was cold (refrigerated), hence partially responsible for the lower rating this time around.  Their pastries look good, I should have taken something home for dessert. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for a place like Lamanna's Bakery in this part of the City! You can feel the Family run vibe in everyone working there. Delicious pastries and take out pastas. The arancini is huge and one is enough for 2 people as a side.   Their coffees are also fantastic. There's one guy who works at the espresso bar who makes the best cappuccinos. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I heard about the giant slice of pizza, it started in NY, we thought about doing a road trip just to get our hands on it. But as soon as I found out, this bakery has Toronto's very own giant slice pizza, we had to support our locals.  A very authentic vibe to the bakery, little seating areas so I wouldn't suggest big groups. I would say do a take out and find some where nice and warm to enjoy the food.  It was pretty busy when we got there. We ordered and got our food pretty fast, food is amazing, tasty delicious. Friendly staff, just a good positive vibe environment.  Please note, if you do try to attempt the giant slice pizza... bring more than two people. My boyfriend and I tapped out about half way. We were both so optimistic. I had to meal prep and freeze whatever I couldn't eat because I would have gotten sick of it.  Our pizza got cold pretty fast due to the in and out of the entrance. It's pretty chilly in the bakery as well.  I applaud whoever can finish the pizza in one sitting. :)"}
{"text":"One of the greatest bakery in town! Though there's a constant line up for either hot meals or the bakery side, if is definitely well worth it!! Their cannoli is a much try! Actually all their pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"This bakery is always very crowded, but the service is SO fast that it's really not a problem. They've got delectable pastries, I recommend the lobster tail pastry (it's called that because of the shape, it doesn't actually have lobster in it) and the eclairs.  Prices are pretty high, though I suppose that's normal for the high level of quality they put out. Highly recommend this regardless of the price, it's a really good Italian bakery (and they even have gelato in the summer!!)"}
{"text":"I went to lamanna's yesterday since I can really only make it on weekends. Again, I love the food/treats here but there's always something about my experience that holds me back from giving them the full 4-5 stars! I finally managed to grab one of their cakes for an event I was heading to later that night.  Of course the place was filled to the brim and the wait took some time. I'm fine with that. What bothered me was the person who was helping us was the least bit happy to be there. She was young, sure, but chewing gum and POPING  gum bubbles while taking an order? Seriously? She just didn't care about anything. Slow to respond and then when she does there was a hint of attitude. I'm surprised there isn't a rule which prevents front staff to actively chew gum while interacting with customers.  Rude and unappealing on all levels.  Besides that, the cake was reasonably priced and yum as expected."}
{"text":"Lots of foid to choose from, pizza, pasta, dessert, cake, ice cream, coffee etc. Good portion for the price."}
{"text":"Funny enough, I guess I am considered one of the locals and I rarely ever come into Lamanna bakery other than for the occasional birthday cakes, pastries and some bread.  I have bought some cold cuts here as well as sandwiches which were all just meh.  I lived in Woodbridge before moving here a few years back and coming into Lamanna is always a laughable experience in comparison.  The place is always busy though and it's probably because there is no real competition in the area.  Their hot table is a sad excuse for anyone who's been to a real Italian bakery and the flavours lack tlc.  An Italian bakery with ho-hum tomato sauce is always a bad thing.    On the upside are their cakes and pastries.  Mind you, most of their cakes come from La Rocca, I've seen other patrons picking up some larger birthday cakes they've pre-ordered.  I've only just bought the La Rocca cakes so I can't say anything about their cakes.  Pastries on the other hand, may be made there.  They always have a tower of very attractive looking cupcakes along with a good variety of small desserts.  On a couple of occasions when I bought some of their croissants (chocolate and raisin), they were just a-ok.    There really is not a lot of seating to speak of as most people just come in to grab something and go.  Am I a happy camper because Lamanna is in my neighborhood?  Really....I couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. Very very busy.  Odd setup with ordering on one cash and picking the food up when your number is posted at the hot food station.   While waiting we had a slice of pizza, no lineup at that cash at that time. It was the best pizza we had.  Definitely will come back to order a whole one.   Tried the tiramisu and it was delish.  Got to try some more pastries for sure.   In the summer I can see us having some ice cream there.  Will Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried some of their baked goods here. Overall it was pretty good but what really blew me away was the (Lobster Tail pastry). It was light, crispy, flaky and so yummy. The cream filling on the inside was also light and smooth and not overly sweet. Its a perfect dessert. I would come back just for the lobster tails."}
{"text":"I have been coming & getting treats here for years. It's a nice place, service is friendly, atmosphere is pretty nice. I wish it wasn't in a strip mall but they made the best of the space they had. The coffee's & drinks are my favourite, breads are really yummy. The cookies & little treats they have are good but damn do they look amazing. The cakes people seem to like but for me are not so good. I don't know what it is about them ( I've had a few) but they're just not doing it for me. Overall I think check the place out if you're in the area but not worth traveling to get some goodies from here."}
{"text":"The cheesecake cupcakes are heavenly, as is the banana chocolate chip cake. If you're lucky, they might have Creme brûlée on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Lovely big Italian bakery! One side is for coffee and mouth watering desserts ! The tiramisu was excellent!  The other side is for hot Italian dishes, very fresh! We had the lasagna and meatballs. Both were delicious .  It's a bit busy on weekends and seating is limited ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great fresh yummy italian food and gelato! A bit crowded and finding parking spaces are a bit of a challenge though."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, dinner and dessert at a fair price. Excellent vegetarian lasagna and an amazing selection of daily creations of both fresh entrees and dessert. Follow them on instagram if you like teasing yourself with delicious looking anything. It is often quite crowded in here because, well- they're just that good. Worth the wait every time, and the trip out East of the downtown Toronto core. Some of the best Italian food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This bakery never disappoints. My personal fave are their lemon anything, but come early because they get sold out fast! Lasagna is delicious...both veggie and meat!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place today after a recommendation from a friend we had the arranchini the veal sandwich and the lobster tail dessert. Let's start off with the arranchini the tomato sauce was excellent not to overwhelming and the inside of the arranchini tasted delicious it's a rice ball but had an amazing texture to it. The veal sandwich was phenomenal the veal was perfectly cooked. And the sandwich was ginormous.  For dessert the lobster tail first off I really hate sweet desserts and the lobster tail was not too sweet which I liked really delicious filling. I will come back here to try their gelato next time"}
{"text":"Amazing! Have ordered and sampled just about everything here from the hot table foods to the bakery items.  Cakes are fresh and decorated beautifully.  Hot table items are fresh and authentic- docked one star for the slow service and chaotic, disorganized set-up for ordering."}
{"text":"The first time i came here I tried their deserts and gelato, they are awesome! I particularly like the hazel nut filling chocolate puff! The gelato are smooth and not too sweet. So I decided to come back again and try out their pizza, and I am satisfied. Hot and melted cheese with crispy crust! I will come back again"}
{"text":"A Scarborough community gem for a broad range for homestyle Italian food. I recommend the vegetable lasagne, along with at least one dessert (I usually go for tiramisu or the hazelnut eclair)."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. Service is a bit slow so I had to wait in line for a while but I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind.  I was a little disappointed that they don't make all their cakes. Some of the cakes are by La Rocca. However, that's fine since the prices aren't bad (my rectangular coffee cake is $15).  They also have an assortment of baked goods such as macarons, cupcakes and cake slices. There's also a hot food section that I would love to check out.  I'm a sucker for bakeries and I'm definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"I have to update this.Since my first review I have been back a few times. We were not served cold veal again . I was right that Sunday it was so busy I was served a cold piece of veal . Since then my husband has ordered a few times their veal and meat ball sandwchches.Of course it is not as good as his mom's ( and yes his parents are immigrants from Italy) but I do have to admit my mother in law is truly hard to top ! lol They come close and one of the best bakeries. It's a family business and I have to tell you that the men working have a much more friendlier attitude then the women , but still it beats the service by far ,from the Italian bakery I use to go to at painted post and markham rd! Best of all it is only 5 minutes away from me :) I even stopped going to belaggio's in PIckering  for Lamanna's :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised when Italian cafes started popping up in my old neighbourhood in rouge hill but it was a good surprise because there weren't many food choices to begin with. I came to this place around the Christmas season and it was crowded with people trying to get takeout for special occasions. It was confusing because they had like three cash registers for different types of food. They didn't also maintain cleanliness and I saw a lot of garbage lying around.   When I looked at the hot counter food with main dishes, all I saw was a sea of red. I know tomato is a main ingredient but there was no variety or uniqueness in the way the dishes were displayed. It may be because it was busy but the lumps of lasagna and red penne looked unappetizing. The cashier was pleasant but because it was busy I had to ask for my pizza even though it had been reheated in the oven for a while. I got the potato pizza. It was good except I found it too oily. If there was less oil though it would be fine. My friend also had pizza and she felt sick after because of the greasiness. This was after we both blotted the grease off so imagine how much oil they put. Would I go back? Maybe for something else. But the amount of grease really disturbed me."}
{"text":"A gist of the review: food is amazing. Totally worth the drive from Brampton. I envy my  older sister for  working so close to this place, but at the same time, I'm also quite happy (for both my wallet and my heart lol).  Their portion sizes are pretty good for the price you're paying. The lasagna, both meat and veggie, is super amazing. And goodness gracious is it huge! The sausage is pretty good too. As for the desserts, man oh man! Their lobster tail is oh sooo yummy! I loved their nutella heart donuts as well. The Tiramisu is so so, not really the best.   One thing that irks me about this place is how rude their servers are. If you dont want to be working there, please do everybody a favor and quit."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Ordered several cakes and they don't disappoint. The carrot cake is by far the best. Also gotten  pastries, cupcakes, cookies, macaroons, etc., all really delish. Always a lineup when I come but worth the wait to get some yummy treats."}
{"text":"It is more a 3.5* for me.   I really WANT to like this place considering the many good reviews from the other yelpers, but when I went today it didn't really cut it. It was my first time there and I almost got lost. The bakery is located in a smaller plaza and it is in the corner with a huge sign, but if you are coming from 401 EB, you have to make a left turn at Kingston Rd and then make a U-turn at Port Union in order to get into the plaza. It is very hard to see from this side of the road.   The bakery itself is quite big. As soon as you walk in there are tables for people to sit and eat, coffee and gelato bars, pastries/cakes on the right, hot table foods in the middle that serve a variety of traditional Italian items like Lasagna, Veals, pasta, all of which looked amazing! They also have a wide selection of large thin pizzas on the left of the bakery along with some cold cuts.   I intentionally wanted to come here for the gelato but after walking around the bakery, I really wanted to try their veal on a bun ($5.99) and their pizza ($3.99). You first have you order at the counter and then they give you a number to wait for your order. When I was called, the lady at the counter was SO rude and asked me which type of bun I wanted. It is obvious that it was my first time but she was pissed when I asked her the different types of buns that they offered. She was SO rude. I completely understand that English isn't her first language, but her attitude towards customers was just ridiculous. She was very impatient with me and she just didn't want to serve me. One star off for this. The Veal on the Bun itself was only alright. There wasn't enough sauce. It was very bland. Nothing special about it.  The pizza that I ordered had Bechamel sauce, ham and cheese? I forgot the exact name of it. The young lady told me that it is one of their popular ones so I ordered it. I personally prefer thin crust pizzas so I was SO excited to try it. The pizza was alright, but a little salty for my liking. Maybe next time I'll try the spicy ones. All of their pizzas looked great though.   After ordering the hot foods, I went over the gelato counter to order gelatos! Once again, rude service from another middle aged lady! I paid for a small cup (2 flavours for $3.95) and proceeded to sample the flavours. A young lady came over and started serving me for like 2 minutes. She told me that hazelnut flavours are their most popular. When I have decided which flavours to get, I told the young lady but she ignored me because she saw new customers in the line and told me that the same rude middle-aged lady would serve me again. THIS IS VERY CONFUSING. The same person should serve the SAME customer. You don't just run off to serve someone else. Very bad customer service.   I got 2 hazelnut flavours: Nocciola and Setteveli. Both are great on their own but  when they are put together, it gets really sweet. Next time I might try a fruitier/tartier flavour to pair with the hazelnut. The presentation of the gelato wasn't good either. The middle-aged lady was pissed and just plopped them in the cup, but at least I got 2 giant scoopfuls of gelato. There are cannoli cones ($+1.00) for the gelatos, which I will try next time I am in the area :)"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back. I've always passed by it and never really paid attention until my buddy and I couldn't decide what to eat and it had to be good and fast. So we decided to go but it was so hard to find parking and almost left but we got lucky. Thank goodness coz it was such an amazing pizza. The first time I tried a potato and onion pizza. A huge slice but I could have had another one so I bought some to take home. Can't wait to try the sandwiches and desserts."}
{"text":"Best Italian bakery in the east end. Everything is great here from the food and coffee to the delicious sweets. The only place I go to for cake and gelato. Very busy at lunch time. They usually have 3 line ups to the door. The atmosphere and design of the place is also awesome. Owner works on the floor and is very friendly including staff. The only thing I wish they had were panzerottis but it's probably good for my waist that they don't. They also have French macarons made in house."}
{"text":"The best place to buy desserts! Just amazing! Especially the lobster tails. The hot food is great too. The Pizza is so good!"}
{"text":"The best pasteries I have ever tasted! My god I am in heaven with every order I have ever had! My husband and coworkers make a point of being there in the days they have the sausage on a bun, my daughter loves the penne and lasagne, and I love the sandwiches. An excellent choice for a great lunch (make sure your hungry!) there is very limited seating so plan to eat elsewhere, but great catering idea and if you neead a cake or dessert tray put  together for any occasion, this is the place to go! Enjoy everyone, but go hungry!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've never tried anything from here that I did not like. When I was pregnant I used to go in all the time and order cannolis. Mhmmm. Although I do have to say nothing competes to their pizza. It's great how this bakery has such versatility. It's also very clean and well organized. Definitely will always be getting my money."}
{"text":"The best bakery / cafe I've come across. An amazing selection of pastries, breads, cakes, coffee and a terrific hot counter selection - the Lasagna is amazing, tasty, flavourful and the portion is huge - it could easily feed 2 people (about 6.50$ for a portion). They have oven baked pizzas with many topping options! Delicious!! Everything is fresh. They are always coming up with new ideas and products. The line up in a weekend can be pretty long, so pack your patience .... But it's so worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The workers there arent very outgoing, even if you have been going there for years. They don't smile.    The prices are average for a specialty bakery. They have a regular rotation of pastries and desserts and they're gorgeous. Most of them taste nice.  A lot of the cakes and desserts are from third party companies, such as \"Dufflet\" (three locations in downtown Toronto). So I'm not sure which of the pastries and desserts that they actually make.  The donuts, cupcakes and whoopie pies are not so good.  The stuff that is actually made by them is more likely to be the cooked foods.  Otherwise, I recommend the place."}
{"text":"This will be my number 1 go to from now on! They have the best baked goods out of all the places I have been to. People here are nice so it makes you want to go back. They don't just sell breads and sweets, they have FOOD- pizza, pastas, and more! Would definitely try their pizza next time. It's also the place to bring the whole family for brunch/lunch because they have a big space and it's family-oriented. They have ample space for parking which is good. Nothing bad to say to this place so see for yourself!! You'll loved it too!:)"}
{"text":"Great little family run business... It is always busy which is definitely a good sign! I have never had any issues with the food or pastries, as they always seem to amaze me. I have also ordered catering and cakes for special occasions many times and have been very impressed by the quality. I don't mind waiting in line because I know that it is worth it. Also, they just recently added digital screens to try and help the confusion regarding the hot table. I just absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG where do u start? Came here for a coffee and a chit chat with my sister and her finance. The fresh smell of wood oven pizza made or impossible to not oder a slice! I got the veggie slice. It was so hard to decide what to get.  They have a full hot table with lasagna, tortellini, hot chicken/veal sandwiches. On the sweet side, the have a large assortment of pastries, ghelato, cookies and cakes. Cannot wait to come back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Lamanna is must visit stop whenever I'm home visiting family.  This petite Italian bakery is growing as rapidly as my waistline!  The word is officially out and the place is packed most time accordingly.  If you love cakes, cupcakes, Italian pastries, including hard to find authentic cannoli then you have found your nirvana my friend!  In Toronto we take places like this for granted.  Please don't, it's a true gem!  If you are planning a party, you can easily call ahead to make sure your treats are waiting for you upon arrival.  If pastry was not enough, they provide real ingredients to make the best homemade pizza you can muster.  What's that you ask?  Yes, they have fresh pizza dough, fresh meat toppings, sauces and other essentials for fantastic home made pizza.  They also feature Italian sodas, and a small collection of drinks.  All the goods aside make it a really nice place.  The top notch customer service makes it a stand out great place.  When you come enough times, they know you by name too!  It's always fun to strike up a conversation with other friendly shoppers as we gaze onto the case of mouth water treats.  I want that one, no that one, okay, I'll take all of them! LOL  The trendy little Vespa bike, old school movie posters and other frills on the wall add some character in what would otherwise be yet another Scarborough strip plaza.  Cannot wait until my next visit to enjoy the Napoleon cream filled pastry!  Count down begins..."}
{"text":"I have frequented Lamanna's for years and highly recommend them as a local treasure in East Scarborough. Their recent renovation brought with it pizzas, various meats, and a gelato bar in addition to their hot foods and bakery section. We'll pick up their lasagna and chicken parmesan for dinners and are consistently blown away by the reasonable cost and extraordinary taste. Often, when buying enough for multiple nights, the owner Joe will throw in some freshly-baked panini rolls with our order. Besides personal meals, we have ordered full lasagnes for entertaining as well as their ever-amazing baked goods (I suggest the lemon cake; tart and very lemony but not over-the-top sour or sweet). Their small bakery items like bite-sized cheesecake and chocolate chip cookies are heavenly... soft milk chocolate chunks mixed with hard dark chocolate pieces on a giant cookie cannot be missed! While the ordering and payment system could be improved (it can be confusing where to stand for what, and you could end up wasting time in a line that doesn't do what you want), the fantastic atmosphere and mouth-watering foods simply make it a must-stop. If you are in the area, this is THE local authentically-Italian bakery!"}
{"text":"The original cannolis were my favorite on the menu! Definitely my future cannolis-go-to fix. IM A HUGE CREAM FAN & I love love that their creme isn't very heavy nor too sweet! So, I went a bit crazy, I started off with one Napoleon chocolate, one Napolean vanilla & a cup of aromatic espresso, it was quite the trio pairing (wish I had ordered more coffee, anyways I will likely return on a weekly basis). Moving on, the tiramisu tasted typical, it was moist but nothing special. Cream puffs were nicely decorated but the additional icing/cream was too sweet and it overpowered the puff in my opinion (there was also chocolate decors LOL at this point I had also finished the espresso, which was amazing. The barista is very attentive and passionate about every order) - the ambiance feels new and clean compared to other Italian bakeries. This review is solely based on the dessert and coffee. I have yet to try any of the hot food menu though. The bakery is just off the highway of Port Union, if it wasn't such a mission, I would probably be camping there everyday. I'd definitely recommend a sweet visit to pick up a box of if I'm in the area though!"}
{"text":"Lamanna's Bakery is really out of the way for me... all the way out at the Port Union Road.. so far East it is at the border of Pickering. But I think it is worth your while to drop by if you are in the area.  Lamanna's has some of the cutest pastries I saw.. and the best thing is they are small and cheap! $1.49 for the Raspberry White Chocolate cheese cake or a Tiramsu and Cannoli with cream is $1.29. You can ended up eating a few of their pastries without getting a sugar high and can try a few too!!  The interior is nicely decorated with a Tuscany feel... the scooter with the flower basket. And for your soccer fans, they have their flat TV screen tuned into games.  The coffees are freshly brewed even for the regular coffee. The prices are all really reasonable and they serves their cappuncino in proper glasswares.  There are also Italian pasta, sandwiches for sale. A lot of locals dropping in for lunch and even the police officers and fire fighters are their regulars.  Seating are limited but the turn around is fast and a lot of people are doing takeout instead.  I will for sure be back to try out more of their cute little pastries...maybe I can get some for my coworkers and they will think I paid a fortune for their treats!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the pizza is awesome! The cannoli is good, but not the best in the city. And the service is not the best too, people in the pizza part was very confused and not so nice, but I'll totally come back there and try some lasagna that seems to be amazing!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the bakery. It was super hard to get anything from here for the longest while while it was renovating but after it just looks so much better and a lot more inviting. Have yet to try their food but it looks amazing. Really wish they had peanut free opinions."}
{"text":"One of my favourite little places to have a bite at, in the area. I'd love to give 5 stars but the service is just so slow sometimes and the ordering/lineups can get a bit confusing. Other than that, top marks from me.   With that said, once you get up to the counter to order, the servers/cashiers are super attentive and knowledgeable (considering how many items they carry). If you get claustrophobic, this is not the place for you on a Friday or Saturday afternoon. They get really busy but they do keep the place quite clean and free of debris. I've always been able to find a place to sit, even at the busiest times.   Now for the food.  The pizza and pastries are the bomb dot com. If you're looking for a carb/sugar coma, you've come to the right place!  Wonderful espresso beverages made with patience. Lastly, my favourite part, gelato. The gelato is my favourite part because the texture is just right and there's always a fun flavour to try.   Don't walk into this place looking for a deal, you're not going to find it. You will find great thing with a \"you get what you pay for\" price tag attached. Not great for a first date because it can get loud but I've definitely done lunch/coffee dates here that impressed my dates and got me another date lol."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat I've had Italian food all over the city and this is definitely a hidden gem ...........THE PIZZA IS FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place!  Where else can you get good food, good desserts, good coffee and good people?  Here of course!  There's a reason why people flock to this place, it's because the people here cook and bake with love so it shows.  If you've never been here then I suggest making a pit stop.  You'll thank me later :)"}
{"text":"had to come here to try their big giant slice. and its no joke!! b i g !  g i a n t ! s l i c e ! its like 2ftlong! their dough is crispy and chewy! i wish they could've made ot a tad thinner but the huge slice probably wouldnt hold up. they have other hot food options like pastas, meatballs, a variety of pizzas by the slice, baked sweets & coffee! worth a check out for the pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Despite the long line ups the wait is always worth it. They never let me down. I usually order a pizza slice to eat while they get my cold cuts ready. I usually follow all that up with their amazing coffee. I haven't even talked about their cakes. They are second to none. Best cake/dessert section in town.  10 stars. Best of the best."}
{"text":"Went recently, my first time after the huge expansion (which is gorgeous) but I left so disappointed.  I felt that there was much less selection in the bakery. I did grab a few pastries I was craving and they were delicious. However that did not make up for their rude staff that aren't very customer service oriented. As much as I love their lobster tails, two of their employees completely turned me off from coming back.   Only giving 3 stars for ambience and food. They need to better train staff on friendliness or not hire unpleasant people at all."}
{"text":"As the other reviews all say, this bakery has great lasagna! The rice ball with sauce is also definitely worth it, for just under $4, this usually fills me up as I am not someone who eats a whole lot. The lasagna is HUGE and usually takes me and a friend to finish it, which is an amazing deal for under $8!  I've tried a couple of the pastries and honestly, when you've tried one of the cream-filled pastries, you've tried them all. Most of them are made with the same dough, and use the same cream on the inside so when I tried the lobster tail and the little cream-filled pastry with the fruits on top, other than the fruits, they tasted exactly the same. Not to say that they aren't bad, because they do taste good and are worth the money, but if you want to try a whole bunch of different desserts, definitely try the cakes and maybe just one of the pastries.  (The tiramisu is also a delight!)  tl;dr: Great food, great prices. Very cute decor and service is quick and attentive. Definitely worth the visit, even if you're not in the area."}
{"text":"I've been hearing positive comments about this local bakery. I went there to try their famous pizza and got a bit disappointed because it's very dry. Maybe because we did not get the freshly baked ones. Next time I will make sure to order it at the spot to try again and hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"The strip mall doesn't look particularly exciting, but Lamanna's Bakery is great. We had some of their sweets and cappuccino. Everything was very good. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Lamanna bakery. Their coffee is much better than Starbucks next door. Their pizza, porchetta, lasagne, pastries, and cakes are all extremely delicious. Tip: avoid the lineup at the pastry counter -- go directly to the pizza counter to order hot food, coffee and other items."}
{"text":"I go here from time to time to get a nice veal sandwich. Let me tell you, it is awesome. Veal melts in your mouth and the sauce is rich and tomatoey. I always get it with mushrooms and hot peppers on a nice fresh Kaiser bun with a crusty outside and soft inside. They know what they are doing over there with the veal sandwiches... The Italian Big Mac!"}
{"text":"There is not a dessert in Lamanna's that is not divine. It is so heavenly. There is usually a line up at lunch time and Saturday and Sunday afternoons is busy. Best to go first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"What I LOVE about Lamanna's - It's less than 5 minutes from my house and work so I'm constantly driving past it  What I hate about Lamanna's - It's located dangerously too close to my house / workplace!  Lamanna's is much more than a bakery. Not only do they sell an assortment of fresh baked goods and traditional Italian pastries, cakes and cookies they also carry an assortment of La Rocca cakes plus the have a deli with fresh meats and cheeses, they are also a cafe serving up a variety of hot/cold drinks, and on top of all that they have a hot food counter serving up made to order sandwiches (breaded veal / meatball / deli), daily pastas, focaccia style pizza, lasagna, meatballs, and arancini (rice balls)  I can attest to the meatballs, rice balls, and lasagna that they are HUGEEE portions but totally worth it because they are all super delicious and very light on the wallet.  For the baked goods you can't go wrong with any of there homemade Italian delicacies. I love there Amaretti cookies and there Sfogliatelle pastries aka Lobster Tails which are out of this world!  They make mini versions filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream filling which is to die for! As well any of there custard and cream filled pastries and cakes are simply perfection!  Plus they make a mighty good cupcake with constantly new and changing flavours.  Hands down the Best bakery in the East End! There is something here to please and delight every pallet!  FYI Check out there Facebook page to see pictures of what there baking Fresh everyday except Mondays because that's the only day they are closed :   http://www.facebook.com/LamannaBakery"}
