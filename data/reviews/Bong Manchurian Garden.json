{"text":"always closed. The chances of being open is purely based on luck. Likewise, the food to is also hit or miss. Sometimes it is old and dry, while sometime is is beyond perfection. The store is run by one hardworking lady. All props to her, she always make me smile!"}

It's better they close n operate it like a kitchen than a restaurant ."}
{"text":"This place is always closed 
So true, we were here at 8.10 pm on Wednesday 
There was no one at the restaurant 
We waited a while for a woman to come out of the kitchen and she refused to serve food saying they only cater food for parties not a dine in or take away
We obviously were disappointed"}
{"text":"I have tried to get take out from this place on 4-5 different occasions; different weeks, day of the week and even the time of the day. I have been told they are either closed or just about to, or they ran out of ingredients for my order. I still haven't been able to order anything to date. My only tip and feedback is to 
always call them before hand!"}
