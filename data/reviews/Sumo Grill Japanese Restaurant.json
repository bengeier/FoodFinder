{"text":"I can make better ramen at home with real noodles. And the sushi isn't that great either. The fish doesn't taste fresh and the waiters a bit rude."}
{"text":"Food is great but the staff enter in their own tip in the debit machines before handing the machine back for you to pay.  Between 4 couples at one table they racked up a $24 tip and shortly after started to hurry us out the door."}
{"text":"I like the bento boxes here, you can mix and match as you desire and for ~$10 for lunch you can't really go wrong. I usually get the teriyaki salmon and tempura, and you get a side of rice, salad and soup with it as well.  If you're looking for unique sushi - the crunchy salmon roll is the way to go. Salmon topped with sriracha mayo and corn flakes!  Maybe not as \"authentic\", but it's quick and easy and sometimes that's all you need when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Calgary, ever! Me and my boyfriend went for some sushi after shopping a few weeks ago and I have been meaning to write a review. The staff were absolutely wonderful, very polite and attentive. The sushi was phenomenal, very fresh and very reasonably priced. I believe we had the California roll, the avocado roll, dynamite roll and the sushi cone. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with my family as it was my brothers birthday, we had waited for about an hour for a waitress to take our drink and food orders ans when she did she seemed a little distant and inpatient. Food was okay but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The place is conveniently located inside the mall and they have some great prices for lunch. I didn't have dinner so I cannot review their dinner menu.   For lunch i ordered a bento box and a roll.   Must I say, I was shocked to see a \"crunchy\" roll come with corn flakes !!! Never in my 18 years of eating sushi had I experienced that. Maybe it's a new thing? Maybe it's a regional thing? Maybe it's a them thing? Lol   Either way, it was Shockingly OK! Hahaha! I honestly was expecting it to be gross and horrible and I was prepared to send it back. But I actually enjoyed it and ate it up. Was it the best I've had, NO! Was it ok and edible? YES!   Their bento box was big and I couldn't finish it. However, I did enjoy the meal and I would order this again.   The staff isn't very friendly, but I mean, as long as you don't mess up my order, i'm ok! Lol    Would I return? ONLY if I was at the mall, starved and in a rush. Lol"}
{"text":"Overall this was a great experience we went here for lunch just taking a break from mall shopping.  The staff were really friendly and attended to all of our needs they double checked on our table regularly and our drinks never went empty. It was a great experience and the sushi was super fresh.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!!  It also was the right price!  The bento box is an excellent value."}
{"text":"I was recommended this by a co-worker so I went for lunch.  While the service was very slow even by evening standards, the food was fresh.  My order included:  Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll Ebi Sushi Smoked Salmon Sushi Prawn Tempura Roll House Roll Dynamite Roll Green Tea  While the service is slow as previously mentioned, it is pleasant. Hopefully, on my next trip, they will be faster!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible, staff are usually quite rude, the only ones who actually pay attention to you are the cooks when you walk in. I ordered from here for my break, got told it would be 15-20 minute wait, so I didn't take my break until it should have been ready. I got there and my sushi was sitting on the counter but waited 20 minutes until the rest of my order was ready. Wish I hadn't paid before I got my food because there would have been ZERO tip. My sushi was mushy and cold (it was tempura, so it should've been warm). Honestly not worth the money to get treated like crap by the employees and have such gross food. I've given this place far too many chances & this was the last one. It's a great location, wish they would try harder to keep their customers happy though."}
{"text":"Sumo quality is consistent and dependable and with their new Menu which features a good variety of rolls, both vegetarian and fish,  my daughter and I were satisfied.   Remembering that this restaurant is situated in a busy Mall, Sunridge and has been around for over a decade,  it's a place we go when we crave Sushi but don't want to pay $$$ and/or wait for a seat or drive across town. Sumo is always clean, the service is traditionally Japanese and the food is good, solid  Sushi.  For those who don't get the non-engagement of the polite service in a traditional  Japanese restaurant it goes like this.   Your server in a traditional Japanese restaurant is not there to give you a dining experience, make eye contact, smile and introduce specials, the food is supposed to do that.  Also privacy is a very big part of the dining expereince in such a restaurant.  You should be able to have a conversation without worrying about your watier or waitress interrupting. So after a long day of engaging people, my daughter and I were more than ready for unobtrusive,  but politley attentive service.  I did  give a little freak-squeak when I saw the price of the individual sushi pieces.  I'm not used to paying over $3.00 for a single piece of salmon on rice.  Especially not for a late lunch! The manager herself came out and asked if we liked the new menu.     I said I didn't know yet.  That was a big thing for this restaurant.  Managers rarely come to the table unless there is a problem with customer satisfaction so I was very impressed.    That she remembered us made me even more impressed.   And yes, the new menu is good.  The rolls are on par with those at the old Chopsticks restaurant across from Marlborough Mall which was a family favourite but is no more as  the restaurant was  sold and renamed a while ago. So if you like rolls and polite, discreet service, a clean atmosphere, and a break from the noise and chaos of a shopping marathon, Sumo is a good place to rest your feet and savour the quiet. And if you are a vegan,  you can eat there without worry.  The vegetarian rolls are prepared with thought to the vegan palate."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and odd service. One maki roll arrived before the appetizer, the other 40 minutes later. Not really any better than food court food but pricier."}
{"text":"Tourist review..  It's literally lodged between meh and a-ok, but some tasty oysters pushed it over.  Granted I don't know how the japanese food scene is up in Calgary, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but i wasn't a fan..   Sushi in my opinion was pretty expensive and it was a lot of rice w/a thin sliver of fish that didn't have much taste.. didn't soak up the soy sauce at all..   The oysters i did enjoy.  Fresh tasting w/yummy ponzu!  Soft shell crab nothing to write home about..  So 3 oysters, 3 salmon sushi, 1 unagi, 1 soft shell crab and $33 later, i find myself in the food court eyeing all the food there n getting ice cream."}
{"text":"Sushi is always expensive in Calgary but love this location as it provides a great atmosphere to bring kids and family with large tables and private room that fits up to 14 people.   Staff are super friendly and service is great.   Selection is very good and lots of options of sushi and hot food. Lunch menu does have bento boxes.   Great place if you like to try sushi for the first time or try a different place."}
{"text":"We decided to order delivery from SkipTheDishes because our favourite sushi spot Sushi Toki doesn't deliver and my husband didn't feel like going to pick it up. The delivery system was fine, it was fast but the food left something to be desired.  The California roll was OK, the back roll not bad, but the dynamite roll tasted fishy, the flavours of the combo sushi was not great! The beef yakisoba noodles were not good, it looked great but flavour was bland. I did not feel great after eating and when I realized I had already eaten here a couple of years ago with my kids and also did not feel well and I didn't like it then, I wouldn't have ordered from here!!  The rating was 9.8 on SkipTheDishes that is so off base! So back to what I know I love, and never again order from my favourite spot because they don't deliver!! Please be careful when ordering from here, Sushi is not something to be messed with!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Japanese restaurant. Maki were okay but they use a lot of rice so quite large. Service was subpar and not a lot of interaction with table. Very clean restaurant and a bit pricey for quality of fish."}
{"text":"Average sushi place, has a good selection of main entree dishes. However I wish they had \"special rolls\", that sure would differentiate them from other sushi restaurants. If its one thing I can't stand is warm rice with my raw fish so that was a negative. Deserves 3 stars for its nice set up, pleasant service, and average sushi."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi spots, best in its area that I've tried. Take out is quick and delicious, lots of great rolls and hot appetizers. Food is consistent in quality whether dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and were quite hungry, but didn't want to settle on food court food in Sundridge Mall, so we decided to go and eat at Sumo.  Well, we didn't have high expectations, but still the food quality went below that.  The service was great and the severs were all friendly, but the overall food quality and price was not worth it. Way too expensive for the kind of food they serve.  We spent $170 for 5 people. We ordered takoyaki, bbq squid, and calamari for starters. Then we ordered dynamite roll, California roll,a specialty roll, 3 bentos, and yakisoba. None of which were that good - some dishes were too salty/oily and some didn't seem to be seasoned at all.  Probably won't come back, and if in the area or shopping in the mall - I definitely recommend to settle for some food court food instead of paying more money for the same quality of food."}
