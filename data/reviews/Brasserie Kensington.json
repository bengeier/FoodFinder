{"text":"Honestly I don't understand how this place is still open. Me and my husband went for brunch and the food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible. Let me start with the food, I ordered the breakfast poutine and it almost made me hate poutine. The fries were rock hard and the amount of gravy they gave would have sufficed for 1/4 of the amount of poutine they gave. My husbands crepes were also quite soggy and they sat on the counter in the open for quite some time. Now the service it was terrible to be completely honest, but it was most certainly not the waitress' fault. She had so many other tables and I did not see her stop once the entire morning we were there. It was very clear that the morning was understaffed and the two girls working were over worked and even though the manager was clearly trying to help when he could. Honestly it seems like the restaurant hung these two poor girls out to dry as they were the only two on the floor. Honestly I'm just fully disappointed in the entire experience the restaurant has a cool feel but it didn't make up for the lack luster food and service."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND TERRIBLE SERVICE:   I am very sorry I suggested this place for dinner with my friends. First of all, I don't know if the managers of Brasserie Kensington realize this but their menu online is NOT UP TO DATE (as of May 9th 2012). I looked up the menu in advance and so did my friends, when we arrive to the restaurant we get a substantially different menu, not only with different items but with different prices (HIGHER PRICES in the new menu of course) and also I must mention that one member of our party got the old menu so there was literally TWO different menus in our table!  Second of all, the service was probably one of the worst I have ever had in Calgary, our server was CLUELESS, INATTENTIVE and she really did not know the menu at all. She was LACKING that confidence and knowledge of the menu that you expect in a server when you are about to spend a lot of money on dinner.   Needless to say, our food took ALMOST ONE HOUR to come, it was not impressive and I would strongly recommend other restaurants in Calgary with similar menu items over this one. Also, for me it is not only about the food, a DISAPPOINTING surprise like the menu disparity or the bad service are enough to make me not want to come back.   And for those looking for FOOD advice: the saffron broth in the bouillabaisse was not really good, the duck rillete sandwich was really rich and it became really heavy to eat after a while, specially paired with oily fries!, the lamb burger was dry (overcooked), the duck breast was tender but then again it was not spectacular and the nicoise salad was a waste of time.   And there you have it, maybe they should make this restaurant a poutinerie  since that is the only thing people seem to like from this place."}
{"text":"I literally have dreams about the duck and quinoa waffles from here. The happiest of dreams. I wish it was available all day, every day."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard that they fry their fries in duck fat, I decided I had to visit Brasserie. My gf and i made a reservation for 630pm on a Saturday, and the place was actually dead until about 730pm, and remained on 3/4 full.  We started with a shared soft shell crab appetizer. Not bad, a little too deep fried that overtook the taste of the crab inside. But the creamy butter sauce made up for some of that. It came with a delicious asian slaw. I had the hanger steak with mushrooms, and they were concious to cook it the way I liked, it came with their duck fries, and we got duck gravy on the side. I wasn't overly impressed. I found the fries a bit salty and couldn't tell they had been fried any differently. The steak however, was perfectly flavourful, and only $19, which I found quite cheap for the size of the cut. My gf had the Clam Papardelle, which is clams in a light sauce, with pasta, as well as mussles on top. It was delicious, and the pasta wasn't overcooked. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert, but they had a good array to choose from. Service was great, and our server kept tabs on us, but at the perfect times. I would go back again, since there were so many things we wanted to ry - it took us 30 minutes to choose our two mains!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  On a Saturday night out with a friend, we found it energetic and easy to chat and nibble.  We sat at the bar in front of Sous Chef Richard and enjoyed the movement and his quiet and deliberate attention to ever dish he put out.  I could tell it was his passion to cook.  We sampled appetizers and, of course, had a bottle of wine.  We spent hours chatting and watching the kitchen move through its courses.  The service felt and was extremely personal and we enjoyed every minute of it feeling treated to an evening out \"Brasserie-style\"."}
{"text":"Very good food and solid ambiance. It was casual and modern but not overly hipster. We enjoyed our food and the beer selection. Out only criticism was that the ketchup was weird tasting (they got the cheap stuff). Besides that this place is really good and we intend to return."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of first dates some good, some bad and some so painfully dull that Alcohol hasn't a hope in hell of saving it; the date I took to the Brasserie belonged to that category.   The saving grace was the delctable food provided to me here; I ordered the Roasted Brome Lake Duck Breast and it was simply deliciuous. It takes skill to prepare a duck breast properly; the Chef did an amazing job. That dish paired with a nice white wine made an epically disastrous social event into a epicurean delight.   I will return in the future with a different dinner partner.   The only negative is that it is on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch because of the yelp reviews. It 's beer selection was surprisingly varied - this alone would warrant four stars. La chouffe, coffee, halfsies of the special of the day, bacon wrapped meat loaf, and duck rilette with Brie cost about $30 including taxes and tip. The meats were tender, moist and well seasoned but not served warm however.  Same for the duck fat fries, which were too soft for my liking and served cold.  The house salad vinaigrette was the tastiest item surprisingly. Good food and beers but not the tastiest."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I did the Big Taste lunch at the newly opened Brasserie.  We started off with their version of a split pea and ham soup, which was awesome.  It was served with just a few pieces of tender pork, a perfect size for a starter and not overwhelmingly salty!  Our main course was an open faced corned beef sandwich on what looked like marble rye bread which had a lather of some sort of pesto sauce, topped with tender corned beef and either brie or camembert cheese.  It came with fries and housemade ketchup.  This was nothing short of delicious, although it was one of those things where the flavours were stubborn so each new bite wasn't as thrilling as the last.  I'm also not a huge red meat fan, but the beef was so tender and well cooked that a true carnivore would love everything about this.  Lastly was what reminded me of my late Grandmother's deep fried donut holes (I know there's another term for them but I can't recall) that she served with honey and cinnamon.  I believe the waiter said they were \"brigets\"(?) but that is exactly what they were warm \"timbit\" sized pieces of fried dough with subtle traces of honey and cinnamon.  I like sugar, so I could have used more honey, but I scraped up every last drizzle there was and enjoyed it nonetheless!  Overall the place was cute, reasonably priced, service was great, and food was delish.  The only thing I wish different was a better description of what we were eating (especially because it was off of a pre determined menu), although the guessing game was fun.  And the Q-Water, I understand the concept of it but I appreciate places like NotaBLE who only charge $1 for it rather than $3.  But on an awesome note, this place had great music!  Everything from Radiohead to Broken Social Scene and even some Arcade Fire!"}
{"text":"Everyone is really nice here.  The manager Matt is very friendly.  The food is great, sometimes a little bit on the salty side but very filling.  Great location, and if you sit by the window you can people watch a bit.  Nice lunch crowd, sometimes very crowded during the evenings.  When it's really full, sometimes, it gets a little loud.  Everyone working there looks like they're having a great time, which is really important. Having everything fried in duck fat makes it taste really good.  Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"I cant say Im the biggest fan of the restaurant layout of Brasserie, I was there on a rainy Friday late afternoon. Its not cozy to me, but who cares, when the food is this good!! I had the oven roasted \"poulet et frites\" (chicken and fries for those who dont speak french) and my friend had the Brasserie Club sandwich. THe chicken was not a huge portion, but extremely delicious and moist, not over seasoned. The fries were KILLER. I believe they are all cokked n duck fat. The sandwich was huge, and was also delicious. Simple ingredients of bacon, gruyere,avocado and chicken, but the quality is what made it so tasty. Didnt get to try any deserts, but am looking forward to returning..even if its just for the duck fat fries."}
{"text":"Brasserie strikes a fine balance between minimalist hipster decor (dark walls, plain tables, and discretely mounted antlers), delicious interpretations of brasserie classics (heavy in the meat and duck fat end of things), and out there dishes that surprisingly hit the mark (foie gras ice cream sundae anyone?).  Everything I've had here has been delicious, and worth the somewhat hefty price. Fun options include a weekly \"build your own poutine\", with options like fried eggs and foie gras. Their $20 YYC burger week offering was one of the best I had, with a great blend of Beef, pork, duck confit, melted brie, arugula aioli, house grainy mustard, crispy onions fried in duck fat. There is no shortage of manly meat offerings, but the place doesn't come off as trying too hard. In addition to wines, they have a varied selection of drinks including fortified liqueurs, scotches, and unusual cocktails that follow the food ethos: French brasserie inspired, but serving up whatever variation on the theme would be the tastiest."}
{"text":"The Brasserie in Kensington is one of the best meals we've had in Calgary in a long time. To be honest, we didn't expect it - it was such a small place, kind of contrived and trying really hard to be hip.   Fortunately, the place totally exceeded our expectations. The ambiance was cool but the music wasn't too intrusive, a soccer match was on the big screen but, also, not intrusive. Our waitress was excellent - just the right amount of friendly, super-informed about the menu and how food was prepared and willing to make recommendations (which were all exactly right).   We started with a foie gras appetizer which was served with a wonderful onion marmalade.  My hubby had the veal burger (which he said was one of the best burgers he's ever had in the city) and I had the pork-belly sliders. Nice flavors and perfect-sized portions.   Dessert was divine. I had the chocolate mousse which was too die!  D had the creme brûlée and loved it.   We paid a small fee for unlimited mineral water which was lovely and were impressed with the bill (even less then we predicted).   We are so glad to have found this little gem. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I only had mussels here for dinner so I can only rate those things. I have to say the mussels were excellent! They were cooked very well. I hate it when mussels are overcooked and they get almost rubbery so I was very glad to find a place that cooked them as they should be.   Based on this experience, I would certainly return!"}
{"text":"I love the brasserie! Think it is a fantastic beautiful environment with class and a bit of pub flair. Totally happy with the style and just the place I want to bring my friends. I have introduced many people to this place and so happy to keep bringing more.   For this reason, It was foie gras night and I love this stuff! We bought multiples and multiples of these with salads and lots of bread, spent over $100 on a regular Tuesday night. The most impressive moment of the night was the CHEF!   He puts his heart and soul into his work and you can see it. We weren't a big fan of the cold foie gras and asked to heat it up. Silly us, it would melt but instead he brought us some honey and gave us advice on a very beautiful way to eat it. Learned something new and so grateful that he took the time to really show us how food can truly be amazing. Our waitress was amazing, totally accommodating for my foie gras addition and super nice. I have waitressed for 13 years and know what is poor service and know what is excellent service. She was just amazing! On a previous occasion bringing another friend who was new our waitress was amazing. I have never had anything bad to say about the service.   I decided to bring another friend their showing him how beautiful the food would be and eager to get the same great service that I had had in the past. But my experience was much different.   We sat in the booth section in the back seated by our server. He asked what would you like to drink. Usually I love wine and nice drafts but I was convinced to stay on my detox from alcohol that month. Liver needs a break sometimes. lol. I told him in a jokie manner I'm on a detox thinking nothing of it. We asked for water and then ordered cranberry juice. Took a look at the menu deciding on the amazing food we could eat and it was if our water had just decided to shun us. Literly lol. It was very strange.   5 minutes had past and as he would walk by he would turn his head the other way and I thought nothing of it in the beginning. So we took our time deciding and waited, 5 more minutes had past. He had to walk past us every time to pick up an order but turn is head completely in the opposite direction. So I just put down our menus so he would know we were ready and 5 more minutes past. We are now 15 minutes in with 2 waters and juice. There were maybe 3 couples in the restaurant and I would try and get his attention each time he walked past us and his head was always 180 in the opposite direction. I asked my friend if I was crazy and we watched him walk 5 times by ignoring us almost purposely. I was in incredible disbelieve of 20 minutes and maybe 25 times walking by with 3 couples and no service.   Finally after this time he came over and said what would you like. I said I'm sorry we have been really waiting a long time and I am unhappy with the service. He said, \" I am busy!\" I asked for the bill and paid and left no tip.   I would not want to see him on a busy night. I don't know if he was having a bad night or judged me on my detox or whatever this service was all about but all I know that we were ignored and were treated coldly. I hope this is not his service on a regular basis cause that is a true shame to other customers paying good money and hope if he was going through something that everything is ok. We all have bad days.   This left a very sour taste in my mouth. I am sorry to say I won't be back because the Chef is truly a gift."}
{"text":"Loved the duck wings and the bowl of fruit was fresh. Not crazy over the fact that my over-hard eggs order came out super runny and I wasn't too crazy over the bacon either."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice Easter weekend brunch type lunch. Enjoyed their crepes and cup of cappuccino. Cappuccino was mediocre. Serving staff were good though not overly attentive. It looks like they were short staffed when we first came but they were better manned by the time we left around 1 o'clock. The restaurant was comfortably crowded!! Will be back."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewer, Erin G. I can't believe Brasserie isn't busier at brunch time! Although I am reluctant to tell others about Brasserie because I appreciate being seated immediately, and not having to wait in a line outside!!   My bf and I had friends staying with us from Edmonton, and we wanted to go out for brunch on Sunday. We arrived around 11 am and there was only one other person in the restaurant! As we got to the end of our meal, the restaurant got busier, but still not even close to 50% full.   Between the four of us, we ordered two different kinds of eggs bennies, french toast, and cobb salad. The potatoes on the side of the bennies were my absolute favourite kind, sliced in circles and baked or fried, like beefy potato chips! I ordered the cobb salad, which looked and tasted great. I wish I took a photo to show how pretty the salad was! The salad had mixed greens, egg, avocado, bacon and crab cakes. I think cobb salads traditionally have ham? The substitution for bacon was an excellent decision.   The restaurant interior has a contemporary style, and they take advantage of the great view onto Kensington Road with huge windows on the north side of the room.   I will definitely return to Brasserie for brunch, and intend to try out the dinner menu too!"}
{"text":"First visit ever, and no regrets. The chef recommended the rabbit, which was the feature for the evening. DELICIOUS. It came with fave beans and who knew fave beans were so good? Honestly, watching the kitchen was quite exciting too. Finished off with the Earl Grey creme brûlée. I loved it, though heads up, there's quite a bit of tea leaves in the shortbread. It's seriously delicious but it prevented me from falling asleep later.. Oops. If I need to come back to Calgary, I'm headed straight here next time! Thanks to the kitchen and waiting staff for being so nice to me!"}
{"text":"Tasty rich french food with a cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Very impressive. This understated gem tucked away on Kensington Rd proves worthy of its high ratings. Visited for brunch yesterday during a brief trip to Calgary and was blown away by the quality of menu (very innovative!), quality of wait staff and reasonable prices. Menu offerings are diverse with just enough variety to retain excellence in each dish. everything we had was delicious but my quinoa waffles with duck confit was amazing! Do not leave here without trying the foie gras-truly amazing and home made. I rarely give 5 stars but this came close."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have dined at Brasserie Kensington and I am a huge fan. Friendly staff, perfect portions.  I chose the Croque Madame with fries and duck gravy. It was a perfect lunch. The wine list is incredible, location right above the Winebar. Prices are very competitive based on the quality of food.  Also, the have recently gone all duck fat in their fryers which makes their fries even more delicious.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out as I doubt you'll leave disappointed.  One of the owners is almost always there and it's highly likely they'll ask you how your experience was. Top shelf and professional all the way. This place could easily become my new Kensington lunch destination."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Calgary. Such amazing food. Best burger in maybe the world. Not kidding. Their homemade ketchup is awesome, fries with truffle oil and parm is to die for."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time on a date, and had a bit of a mixed experience.  First off, make reservations! We didn't  know any better (and were playing it by ear) so we wound up sitting at the end of the bar, right next to the service entrance to the kitchen. Despite the ambiance of the rest of the restro, the bar is loud - and the tv playing sports is a bit of a mood breaker. Didn't exactly scream 'romantic' - but like I said, that's our own damn fault for not making reservations.   Our waitress was a bit... odd. As soon as we sat down, she asked if we wanted a drink, and then wanted to know what we wanted... 2 seconds after giving us a menu. Ummm... we'd like a bit more time, please. She then came back while we were still looking, and couldn't give us any suggestions. It was only when we were finally ready to order the full meal that she decided to tell us that there was a special menu on - did we want it? Well no, but it would have been nice to know about it BEFORE we were ready to order something else.  She was also rather insistent we should get the half carafe of the wine we chose (a medium bodied Riesling, had a good combination of sweet and tart), despite us both saying 'no, we only want a glass each'.   And then... she pretty much disappeared. If we needed anything, it involved diving across the bar to ask for it -including water refills. Got asked once how our meals were, and then at the end, if we wanted dessert. But it was really kind of weird, and she kept staring at us like we were speaking greek right after we'd said something, vs responding. Ok, we both have pretty strong accents, but making your patrons feel like self-concious FOBs when ordering things (and then ignoring them) is really NOT good manners. If you couldn't understand, for the love of god, ask us to repeat ourselves!   As for the food, we ordered the peppercorn brandy hangar steak and the duck breast with blackcurrant sauce. The waitress insisted my date wanted the steak medium rare, despite his asking for a better done steak. And when it came... it seemed tough. Like seriously seriously chewy. What the heck? I admittedly hardly ever eat steak, but that didn't seem right to me. My duck meanwhile, was wonderful - moist and flavourful. Both meals came with french fries which were... all right. I'm a home fries girl, so the little tiny match stick type don't really impress me. But they were hot, and tasted good, so that was fine. We were never offered pepper for them, however, just had a container of ketchup slid across the bar at us.   For desert we shared the popcorn creme brulee. The brulee was wonderful, the popcorn ball that came on the side... a bit odd and flavourless.   Total bill came to $80 before tip, which wasn't really unexpected when we had steak and duck as mains, but still seemed pretty steep (I'm probably out of touch with prices though).   So, the food was (mostly) good, the service indifferent... so we might go back, and we might not -  but we certainly won't unless we can get reservations (preferably right in front of the windows)."}
{"text":"I love Brasserie, the atmosphere is my favourite kind of dilapidated luxury, with it's rough wooden tables and candle holders, kind of a mod french dinner cafe. The place is fairly small, and even a table for two can be quite the wait if you stop in without a reservation on peak periods over the weekend (I've called and been told that it would be an hour). However, the food is always lovely and the atmosphere is cozy.  I've been a bunch of times, and I particularly recommend anything with duck gravy or foie gras, as it's hard to find it prepared as well or as reasonably priced as it is at Brasserie. In particular, I highly recommend the Roasted \"Brome Lake\" Duck Breast or anything with the duck gravy, like the Brasserie Poutine. If you're feeling adventurous and want something fish-esque I suggest the Saffron Cream Mussels, which are awesome, consistently. If you're feeling unadventurous or want to feel more manly, they also have hanger steak with a few different sauce options, I especially enjoy the peppercorn brandy or the blue cheese, the latter is probably not the best idea if you're lactose intolerant, but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I found out about the Brasserie from browsing Muse's website over the weekend, and decided to stop in for a beer and some moules & frites. We weren't disappointed in anything we had - good service and good advice on the beers and food, excellent mussels and fries, and absolutely spot-on average poutine (it is what it is).   Why isn't this a 5-star review? Well, the fries could have been fresher and crisper (all this hype about duck fat and you give me limp fries from under the heat lamp?! Please), there could have been more mussels in that mussel bowl, and the beers were pretty damn overpriced. But it's Kensington Road, so I'll only dock you a star for those sins.  Keep it up, Brasserie Kensington, and hopefully the good reviews will start to overpower some of the poor reviews below. I'm glad we came to visit on a good service day."}
{"text":"I found someone who loves food as much as I do (maybe even more if that's possible!) and we went to Brasserie upon his recommendation. Not only did we have a great dinner, I was able to photo document every dish. That's right, I got to show my true Yelp self and fear no judgement! (This rarely happens outside my friend circle guys, let me have this one lol)  Tapas style, these were the dishes we ordered: Seared foie gras (on grilled brioche, confit quince and pomegranate) Charred humboldt squid (with crispy salami, frisee, olive tapenade and buttermilk dressing) Caramelized brussel sprouts (topped with crispy chicken skin and a side of pork belly) Smoked & maple glazed parsnips (with cauliflower puree, pomegranate and parsnip chips)   We both agreed, if we could have had the foie gras 4 times over, we would. The rich creaminess with salty crust built from grilling was sooooooo good. I wanted to love the sprouts but I think they were a bit overcooked and the pork belly wasn't crispy enough.   They do base their menu depending on what they can source locally, so if you're loving their winter items I'd check it out soon. Which means that Alberta beef tartare and honey & whiskey glazed duck breast are in my near future!"}
{"text":"This place is not for everyone. Bring your palate and relax and enjoy. It's stellar food prepared exactingly which will delight. In real estate it's about location location location. Food is about taste, taste, tastier and you will get that here.  This place is a deep fried gem overlooked."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Brasserie, with a Saturday night dinner reservation for a date night. We showed up on time for our reservation but found that our table would be at least a 20 minute wait, so we could wait at the bar. We were jammed into an already full bar, stuffed at the end next to the garbage can and wait service kitchen access. A bit of a rough start for this experience, I was elbowed countless times by the wait staff and oddly enough we had a hard time flagging someone down to order a couple of martinis. We finally got our table, and what a sweet spot! such a unique view of Kensington, it was really lovely.  From here on our experience was nothing short of awesome. Our server, was fantastic. Really good table side banter, even told some jokes and was just all around charming. For eats, my date was jonesing for a steak so she had that with pomme frites. I choose the surf and turf from the specials listed on the chalk board, which was Mennonite sausage and halibut.  The steak came out rare, as ordered and was lovely. The sausage and halibut I had were fantastic! The halibut was so juicy and perfectly seasoned, the sausage was salty and crispy from the grill. Fantastic.   To follow we settled on chocolate mouse, and we wanted a hot drink to go with it, but without caffeine. There wasn't any listed on the menu, but our awesome server said to put the trust in him as he had the perfect drink in mind.  He came out with a drink called a Beautiful, which was Courvoisier and Grand Marnier served warm. It was the perfect pairing with the chocolate mouse, the orange flavor was ideal with the mouse.  As for the ambiance, the only downside was the music. Too loud and it just didn't match the vibe they had going. We asked a few times for it to be turned down as we were pretty much yelling at each other in some points (was that the booze? ha ha!!).  I like this place and would really like to try it for brunch as other reviews say it's spot on. Either way, lovely spot for a kensi date night!  Review #4 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I found myself at Brasserie after the kitchen closed so this review is from the perspective of the couple of drinks I had on a Tuesday night. We had a couple of Belgium La Chouffe beers or perhaps more commonly known as the \"gnome\" beer. It was excellent having a subtle sweet taste.    The atmosphere is what stands out. We had a seat near the window giving one a nice view of Kensington from the second floor. Candles on the table give the perfect lighting to the restaurant's darker interior. Very hip place, looking forward to coming back for a meal."}
{"text":"Went for Easter brunch and really enjoyed it, never thought of making a bloody ceasar with gin, turns out its really really goos.  Service was excellent although it was a busy Sunday, and the food was very good. Eggs benedict with a real hollandaise sauce is always sensational."}
{"text":"The best fries in Alberta, hands down!  Not only that, but a warm, inviting room, a multitude of foreign beers on tap, an outstanding wine selection, and food that will get your taste buds hoping. The Brasserie is one of the best, tucked-away pubs in Kensington.  Came here for lunch on a quiet Friday afternoon. Had the club sandwich, which was delicious - and their fries, which were absolutely to die for.  They have Grolsch on tap, which is pretty awesome, and the servers were terrific, taking time to explain the menu and keep our bevvies topped up.   I will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Calgary"}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I have ever had! And I have has lots! Yum!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise in the awesome neighbourhood of Kensington. A small, if solid beer selection and great mixed cocktails too.  The food was very good! At our table we had poutine, a lamb burger, split pea and pork hock soup, trout, a salad and another poutine (yes it was that good). It was all cooked well, very tasty and none of it was leftover!  Their desserts are also very good.  Although the dinning room faces North, vampires should consider choosing another spot, as there is a lot of light when the sun is out."}
{"text":"To be honest, my first visit to The Brasserie about 9 months ago wasn't the best. The food wasn't bad, it's just that what my wife and I ordered didn't quite come to the table exactly as ordered. But not being one to make a judgment based on one visit, we gave it another shot.  This time, it was fantastic. I ordered the beef bourgignon. The beef and the sauce were rich and tasty. I would have loved to have it smothering a layer of spatzle, but the fingerling potatoes were good enough. We opened with an order of their homemade onion rings and they were very tasty.  My wife had the French onion soup and some Parmesan Pommes Frites. I saw the broth of the soup and had to try it. OMG! It was so rich and delicious, I couldn't help but to get a few spoonfuls for myself. Luckily she didn't mind. Our friends had the hanger steak and the schnitzel and they both looked great, warranting a pair of enthusiastic thumbs up from our friends.  A mild warning: Don't go by the menu on their website. It is truly incomplete. There is much more to choose from on the actual menu in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh hello, mes amis! Now this is what I'm talking about...French comfort food with a little something extra.   It was my \"Happy Birthday to me\" celebration with family and a few friends and we had just come upstairs from happy hour at Winebar Kensington. I'm writing this review a little backwards, so let's start with the service...  Our server, Monroe, was amazing. So attentive to our little group all evening. He had excellent suggestions and made sure we were well cared for. When my dessert came out, there was even a little birthday candle on the board holding my Earl Grey crème brûlée.  Yes, you heard me right. I said Earl Grey crème brûlée. This is the very item that tipped the scales during my research for our little soirée. It was exactly as I had imagined. Not ice cold (thank goodness) with a firm crackle of sugar on top. The crème itself was already so lovely, and then the shortbread on the side... All I could say that night about the shortbread was \"it tastes like Christmas!\"  From the steak, to the ravioli, everyone seemed to get healthy portions and great flavour. I ordered the cassoulet with duck and pork. Personally, had there been a magically self-refilling dish I never would have gotten to dessert! The pork and duck meat added great texture to the dish, which is primarily white beans. Seriously, this was the perfect meal on a day of crazy thunderstorms.   The appetizers were also really lovely. Steak tartare, poutine with foie gras, more foie gras...did I mention the foie gras? The poutine showcased it perfectly as the warmth from the fries and duck gravy had the foie gras melting in your mouth. How can you go wrong here??!!  I was so incredibly happy with the evening that I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I went to Brasserie Kensington a couple of days ago for brunch. I had made a reservation via Open Table a few days pervious, and our party of 6 was seated at a large table right next to a wall of windows. The natural light from the windows was nice, and the view of Kensington road below is charming. However the ambiance and decor in the dining room is a little lack-luster. The neutral colors and plain styling is a little boring, and doesn't really please or entertain the eye.   The menu reads very French, with items like the duck confit omelette and croque monsieur. Rich food is definitely to be expected here. After asking the server what she recommended, I went with her suggestion and ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and a cappuccino to have while I waited. The cappuccino was fresh and foamy and satisfying, so I finished it quickly and ended up ordering another one!   When our food came, I noticed the whimsical way in which one of my table mate's French Toast was stacked. In perfect circles in a kind of tower covered in powdered sugar. Very pretty. My smoked salmon eggs benedict were very good. The hollandaise was a little too plentiful for my taste, but it was very buttery and whipped quite light for hollandaise, so it was good. The salmon appeared to have been smoked in-house, but I forgot to confirm this with the server. The fruit on the side was fresh, but there was very little of it and fried potato slices on the side were mostly fine, but some were slightly over-cooked, and i found them to be a little under-seasoned as well. Another one of my table mates ordered the duck confit omelette, and it was extremely heavy and rich, containing omelette ingredients, duck meat, and goat cheese all in one package. Perhaps a little too much for most. But it was flavorful, and if you have the stomach for it, probably worth a try.  All in all, a visit to the Brasserie is worth it if you're in the Kensington area and are craving a French-inspired meal!"}
{"text":"My first time trying the place because I just moved to Calgary and wanted to explore a new haunt. We arrived for lunch and ended up staying for dinner. Yeah. But not in a good way. The food rates an A+, but the service deservedly gets an F. We arrived there at 1:00 p.m., the place was only half full, there were seven (7) wait staff on the floor, and we waited 20 minutes for a cup of coffee and another 20 minutes for our meal. Mine was a Croque Madame (how long does it take to melt cheese and poach an egg?); his was a burger (medium). Yeah, and so ... 2 cups of coffee, a burger, and one cheese and egg sandwich later, we had lightened our wallets by $48, not including tip. On the plus side, the restaurant has great ambiance, the location is fun and energetic, and the Kensington neighbourhood rocks with great stores and boutiques. Good mix of clientele and it was a nice change of pace to go someplace where we could park and then walk a bit. I'll give it another try, but I have high expectations for this place. Don't disappoint me."}
{"text":"Perfect place for brunch! The food was amazing, drinks were refreshing and the atmosphere lively. The place itself is small but it really means there isn't a bad seat in the house. The view of Kensington is perfect and entertaining while you dine."}
{"text":"Our party got the foie gras poutine, steak tartare, and beef brisket burger. All were solid choices and the service was attentive. Would go back again when."}
{"text":"Brasserie is a great spot in the heart of Kensington serving up some delicious, locally sourced food with a dedicated attention to detail. With so much locally sourced ingredients, it's no surprise that the food here is truly amazing. In this casual eatery, it seems that no aspect of the dining experience has been overlooked. It's simply next level casual dining at its best.  The lamb burger is perfectly done with bleu cheese, housemade aioli and grainy mustard that sets it off. I'll also add that the meat here is ground in house, meaning that you can enjoy a juicy, pink medium-rare burger.   There is a duck rilette here that is a delectable alternative to the standard pub steak. This open faced sandwich features tender fall-apart duck with an arugula aioli, brie and crispy onions. I always opt for the fries just so I can dip them in the house-made ketchup.  All in all, it's a laid back old-school meets the new in Brasserie. In other words, they make it look easy. Chef Cam is a workhorse and his team are artisans at what they do."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on our first date night in months, and we are so glad we picked Brasserie. The food is AMAZING we both could not get enough, and that Earl Grey Creme Brulee is insane it so good! The servers we had were awesome, super friendly, gave great recommendations on food and what to have to drink with it. We cannot stop raving about this place, it is actually the reason I signed up for Yelp was to give them a great review. Haha! We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the food is so delicious expecially the beer though i seldom drink it before. otherwise?the waiter is so ebullient and kindful. In belief?it is an amazing dining experience"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. The food, service, ambiance and fellowship provided was nothing short of outstanding. As a frequent business traveler, I get to eat out a ton. Like way too often and this place aced any and all expectation. The cassoulet was quite possibly the best I've ever had and fried chicken skin? What? Thanks to the crew for everything! Will be back and will say not going, is a foul!"}
{"text":"Food and Drinks: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Right when I walked in, sat down, and looked at their menu (all within 5 minutes) I knew this was a clear winner in my restaurant books and a place I will definitely come back to check out again. Brasserie recently opened up (about 2 months ago) and is located right above the Wine Bar in Kensington.   My bf and I came here early in the evening but since it was on a UFC night the place was pretty full and we only managed to get seats by their beautiful hardwood bar. The place isn't too big with around 8-10 tables and maybe 6 seats by the bar and a few right by their open kitchen which I love seeing in restaurants. Brasserie exudes a chic, upscale, yet modern and cozy feel to it. The service is fantastic! Since my bf and I sat right at the bar, the bartender (as well as the host standing near us) was really friendly, engaging, and had a good knowledge of the menu and drinks.   Their drinks cost about the same as everywhere else with a few selections costing a couple more dollars like their pints for about $8. They have a fairly big selection of bottled beers from Canada, US, Germany, Belgium, etc, and a few but unique selections on tap from England, Belgium, Germany and Netherlands. Compared to most places they have a considerably large selection of wine by the bottle and glass.  What I also love about Brasserie is their unique menu which although contains the usual fair of soups, sandwiches, burgers, and steaks, it has a french flair to it. Then you also have your typical french cuisine like escargot, foie gras, croque-monsieur (french version of grilled cheese), crepes, and creme brulee. Defiantly not too extreme for North American tastes and very affordable! Sandwiches/burgers go for about $13-$15, and specialty mains (veal, pork hock, trout, bouillabaisse, duck)  from $20.   They also have a selection of unique poutines including the classic, foie gras, pork hock, and mushroom gravy with cheese curds and truffled porcini gravy ($13.50) which my bf got. The portion size was enough to fill my bf up. My only disappointment was that their fries were a little too small and thin, but there was definitely enough gravy to distribute all the way through. The first couple bites were tasty, but became overwhelming too salty to enjoy the last couple bites. I got the Saffron Cream Mussels with fries ($16.50) which was to die for! The mussels were cooked to perfection (not chewy or gritty) in a very rich, savory, cream sauce full of garlic, saffron, and buttery goodness! Once the mussels were all gone I used the fries to soak up every remaining bit of sauce - it was that good. I loved the flavors of the dish but once again i found it a little too salty.  Overall, this place is an absolute gem- great food, fantastic service, and an amazing decor. I highly suggest a visit for dinner or even for their brunch with a french twist (sat and sun from 9am-3pm)."}
{"text":"We were visiting Calgary and went out of our way to come here after finding it had scotch eggs. We don't find them in the US too often so we were looking forward to trying them here. We ended up going in on a Saturday during brunch. We were about an hour or so too early for their lunch menu. The waitress offered to check with the chef to see if he would prepare them for us. He did and we were not disappointed! They were rich and spicy, but the pickled peppers cut it perfectly. Since we were on vacation, we opted for the fried chicken skin too. The spicy green sauce that came with the chicken skin was amazing. I would buy it if they sold it by the bottle. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We would totally come back again if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"What good seed wouldn't consider Brasserie Kensington as a great place to take their mother out for mother's day? After hearing great things about Brasserie's brunch I decided to book a Mother's Day brunch here. It was quite simple and when we walked in on a sunny afternoon in Kensington, there were still a lot of people sitting and enjoying a meal watching people walk by.  I was quite amazed with their brunch menu. Brasserie doesn't mess around and duck and pork are their specialty. I imagined this place would be an expensive dining experience but the prices were reasonable. Best foie gras prices I've seen. Yes I ate a plate of hate, I'm sorry and will make it up...somehow.  My mom had the special brunch which had duck and lobster benedict. Two meats that during when they were both alive, would never cross each other's paths. Can you imagine a showdown between a lobster and a duck? Theres a Godzilla film for that.  I had Sunnyside fried eggs on farm ham, the Croque Madame. With a side of fries it was filling but not terribly greasy that I felt disgusted with myself after. Thats right you heard me.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Brasserie keeps knocking out of the park for me! Time and time again, I've been so into my experiences here I'm ashamed I started this review with a bad baseball cliche to explain the awesomeness this room has to offer.  No nonsense. The Brasserie knows what they do and they do it very well. On paper, Brasserie is French cuisine meets Canadian meets a hearty chunk of hipster, but here's what it really is:   First, they take something freaking epic, and then they do something freaking epic to it. Every time they do this, the result is exponential, not additive. I know I'm nerding, but here me out.  Poutine = Epic Duck fat cooked + poutine = Epic² Fois Gras + Duck fat cooked + Poutine = Epic³  This means, if you gave \"poutine\" a personal epic level of 3, then Brasserie's Fois Gras Poutine is going to be 27 times as fantastic. Science.  This math isn't just for the Fois Gras Poutine - this ratio also works for their maple bacon donuts (Epic³), house cured back bacon grilled smoked cheddar sandwich with tomato soup (Epic³ + 2xEpic) and countless others.  What really makes this place stand out for me is ever single time I go there, I learn about something that makes me want to go back immediately, like:  Fois Gras Mondays - I can't remember the specifics (because beer) but I remember you could add a crazy amount of Fois Gras to anything for $5. Totally nuts.  Poutine Tuesdays - They give you a checklist card and you build your own poutine from all the epic junk this kitchen has. You could go absolutely insane with this. Totally nuts.  Cask Saturdays - They work with local breweries to give you a special one off cask of beer that the world has never seen, every single weekend.  Hats off to Chef Cam and team. Between Brasserie, Winebar and Container Bar, this is one heavy hitting (baseball cliche call-back) block in Kensington."}
{"text":"The one specific reason we came here was that it had foie gras ice-cream.  Yup.  The things I do for food.  I'm grateful that my mum and my sister are not picky and are willing to put up with my foodie nonsense.  We all split three meals as well as the ice-cream for dessert:  -house caesar salad with french onion soup -seared tuna salad -fried cod with manila clams -foie gras ice-cream  House Caesar Salad with French Onion Soup: I honestly don't really like Caesar salads but this one was actually quite delicious! PROS -great portion: huge in fact -dressing was not too heavy and not overly flavorful: perhaps Canadian caesar dressing is different than American caesar dressing?  CONS -almost too big for light eaters like my sister -french onion soup was really salty but then again, I'm not a fan of overly salty things.  This soup would be perfect for my friend John though who loves all things with a salt-lick.  -----  Seared Tuna Salad: by far my favorite after the foie gras ice-cream.  It had sustenance, great flavor, and was fresh and clean after the prime rib dinner the night before. PROS -great quantity -tuna was super fresh for being in \"the middle\" of the country, good sear -dressing was very even, vegetables were not soggy at the bottom  CONS -none.  -----  Fried Cod with Manila Clams: this was our second favorite.  I love cod in general, and this dish was done really well.  My mum really loved this. PROS -great portion to share or even to eat by yourself -clams were flavorful, went well with the cod -I particularly liked the thin-sliced zucchini.  CONS -none  -----  Foie Gras Ice-cream: truth be told, I had no idea what to expect.  But, when I ate it, it was amazing.  As the waitress mentioned, it tasted slightly like burnt caramel but with a tinge more savory than sweet.  In addition, it had that nice grainy consistency of liver.  Now mind you, it does not TASTE like liver, it tastes like burnt caramel.  all in all, it was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. PROS -great flavor, just amazing all around.  CONS -only one tiny scoop for about $6.  I think Morelli's ice-cream in Atlanta which also has some ridiculously good ice-cream is more worth it.  Then again though, this does have foie gras.  As to how much foie there is, that still needs to be investigated.  So delicious.  That ice-cream was amazing.  But all in all, it was a ridiculously great meal.  We went during lunch right when it opened so it wasn't crowded at all.  It was great service as well.  Pictures here: https://rammiegirl.wordpress.com/2015/08/22/an-atlantan-in-canada-calgarybanff-part-2/  Definitely do go if you have the chance.  Even if it was a crap meal, I hope that you give it another shot, hopefully when it isn't crowded.  While a restaurant may be tested to be truly top during the dinner or lunch rush, sometimes it's worth it to go on the off hours just to get a little more attention with your food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so under-rated on Yelp. I'm love with their lamb burger, which unfortunately, is no longer on menu. However, the hanger steak burger is just as delicious. The patty is flavourful and so juicy. I recently sampled the mussels, which were incredible. To date, the biggest, sweetest and plumpest mussels I've eaten. Not even in Vancouver have I had mussels this good. Of course, the frites and spicy ketchup make for a tasty side. The prices are very good, esp. considering Brassiere is ideally located in the high rent area called Kensington. Can't wait to try more of their food, namely the duck and whatever seafood they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh, I'm not totally in love with this place....but it might have been just the experience I had because everyone else I know is a big fan. We had a very awkward server who just seemed to be off his game this night. He was interrupting us, didn't hear our questions, suggested awful food (IMO), and just ...didn't' work for me.  Unfortunately I didn't particularly enjoy my meal, but I do believe that was to no fault of the restaurant, I just didn't want what I ended up ordering.  So this is my fault.  The place itself is quite cute with great views of Kensington. I could see it being a very romantic date night if done right.   I'll have to be back again and update my review cuz this visit just didn't sell it for me!"}
{"text":"I love French and French-inspired food, and found a great place to try a short walk down the street and across a river from my hotel.  I went up the stairs and was promptly seated by the window by a very friendly gentleman, who was also my waiter.  The place has a great, comfortable, casual, yet cool feel, with indie music playing in the background (my favorite!).  Looking outside, I saw that they also had al fresco seating, which also would have been great, since the temps were in the mid-20s C (mid-70s F).    I asked for a white wine recommendation, and was given a sample before committing (always nice!), and then asked the waiter for recommendations, as I saw 3 duck-related options that all looked awesome.  Since I wasn't tremendously hungry, he recommended the Foie Gras Poutine.  This wasn't your normal poutine. The fries are fried in duck fat, cheese curds are added, it's topped with duck gravy, and then foie gras is placed on the very top.  Every bite was so divine!  I am dreaming of eating this meal as I type.  So incredibly good!  For dessert, I selected the Rhubarb Crumble with Crème Fraîche from off the chalkboard. It was perfect - the rhubarb tasted very fresh, not too sweet, and the crumble crisp - the perfect way to end a meal.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Brasserie is easily my favourite restaurant. Anytime we're in Kensington and hungry this is the stop. Most recently I had the Eggs Benedict with house made sausage and I wanted to lick the plate. Every now and then the service isn't great but the quality of food greatly outweighs having to wait a few extra minutes.   Essentially: I've never had a bad meal here and I never expect to."}
{"text":"Quick taxi/Uber ride from the Westin Calgary. (We coulda walked it, only about a mile / mile and half.)  I saw they had cassoulet on the menu and just HAD to go here.  First, let me tell you about the signage on the building... it's kinda small / hard to see / find. So... look for the outdoor seating area on the sidewalk... then take the stairs UP (not down) to the restaurant.  We had made a reservation for a Sunday evening, but we didn't really need one.  We were greeted and sat immediately upon arrival. We even got to pick our seat. So, naturally I picked a window seat so we could people watch and enjoy the lovely warm evening.  We shared a salad that had fried fava bean skins. It was nutty and crunchy and took the place of croutons which was different and fantastic!  I'd never had something like that so I was really pleased we gave it a try.  The dressing was light and flavorful, and the greens were crisp and fresh.  The salad was also perfect for sharing as a starter... otherwise, it would have been kinda big for 1 person.  I had the Cassoulet (of course) for dinner.  I didn't add any more protein to the dish as it was hearty on its own.  Good Comfort Food!  I enjoyed this dish quite a bit ,,. but I must say, I'm spoiled.  I like the version I had in Paris better.  I know... I know... I'm probably splitting hairs here.  I thought the beans were just a tiny bit underdone.  Now the grilled bread it's served with... Holy Moly was that good!  The Perfect amount of smoke and char and toast on the bread.  My mom had the Duck Breast, and that was EXCELLENT.  The duck was fork tender and melted in your mouth.  She gave me a few pieces and when she didn't finish her dinner, I went back for more.  :)  The broth this dish is served in/with ... is Fantastic!  Light and flavorful... not heavy and not overpowering.    Service is very good and friendly.  Love the vibe! It seemed like a neighborhood hot spot with friends casually meeting up for wine or dinner."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews about Brasserie Kensington, I was so excited when I was invited on a business lunch here.  It was a chilly day, so I was in need of comfort food in a bad way.  I tend to not eat very heavy meals at lunch, as I wind up in a Carb Coma for the afternoon and trying to sneak naps at my desk.  So as much as I love anything with duck, I was very pleased that they had a \"grilled cheese and soup\" combo on their menu.  Very delicious and comforting - perfect on a chilly winter day.  The others in my party equally enjoyed their meals.  I would like to come back for dinner so I can indulge a bit more!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the food was okay, but the service was merely sufficient. We were rarely checked, no course was quality checked, and it seemed to take a while to get our first orders in. Also at the end of the meal I ordered 3 desserts, as usual, and even repeated myself to make sure he understand. He seemed impatient that I repeated myself but alas, we only got 2 desserts. After not seeing our server for 15 minutes I asked about the missing dessert and he got defensive fairly quick saying I hadn't order the other one, the one that I was truly excited to try. Needless to say by this point we decided to forgo the third dessert and went on our way.    As for the food I think this place would do well to bring in a guest chef to revamp some of the dishes, garnishes, and even selection. Some items seemed to be out of style 30 years ago while other dishes need just a little something more to leave me wanting more. We had the feature salad, which was pleasant but had the arugula been seasoned with some nice course salt this dish would have been a winner. The peanut butter ice cream tasted of jiffy peanut butter rather then real peanut butter, the caramel was bottled, and the whip cream out of a spray can? Really?    The plating of all of our foodnwas unoriginal and lacked care, and we found simple things, like the pomme frites, to be overcooked or just mishandled. The aioli they brought out tasted more of mayonnaise then anything and the foie gras was over powered by the apricot spread. All in all not a great meal and certainly not living up to the descriptions on the menu. A culinary over haul would put this place on the map quickly, as well as some server training points.    The music was great though....."}
{"text":"The boys and I came in for Saturday evening dinner after a brief stop at my son's favorite candy store.   The mussels and fries (aka moules frites) in saffron cream sauce were sooo good! They were the juiciest, meatiest mussels I've had in a long time! Caution--the arugula aioli that comes as a dipping sauce has pine nuts in it!  The menu doesn't mention this, so please check with the server if you have nut allergies...  Our son really enjoyed his French onion soup (great flavour from the caramelized onions, and best of all, not too salty) and the house ground 8 oz beef hangar burger(juicy and well seasoned) with smoked cheddar and grainy mustard (sans arugula aioli).        The special was a braised lamb shank with chef's vegetables and garlic bread.  The lamb shank was huge (the size of two of my fists)!!  The meat was falling off the bone and meltingly tender.  While the lamb was definitely the star of the dish, the kitchen's attention to the sides were just as impressive.  My green beans and oyster mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly!       Hubby had the bouillabaisse which had a generous helping of scallops, prawns, mussels, squid, and cod.     We still had room to share a foie gras and sea salt ice cream banana split.  Brilliant combination, I must say...      Overall, this was one of the best dinners I've had.  The servers were pleasant, attentive, and knowledgeable.  We will definitely be back.   P.S.  Try their duck wings, they're to die for!"}
{"text":"OMG.   These guys really know how to handle their meat. I haven't eaten that much pork in ages.   Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere. The place was packed with beautiful people.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a couple of our acquaintances.  We have a couple of other favorites in Kensington so we didn't make it here - until last Saturday.  I will say that Brasserie far exceeded our expectations.  I had the duck which was melt in your mouth moist.  My wife had the filet mignon and it was equally delicious.  We paired them with a Melon de Bourgogne - a grape neither of us had ever had before.  It held up very well even with the beef!  Service was competent and friendly but not overly so.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We looked at the menu before we went, and even then we had a difficult time deciding what we wanted to eat. My boyfriend went with the steak with the blue cheese sauce and I had the veggie burger. Both were excellent (maybe his steak was a tad bit better..) and extremely filling. Minus the fact that the patty in my veggie burger kept falling apart because it seemed like it was a lot of dry ingredients packed together (quinoa, grains, etc.), it tasted awesome.  We also went ahead and ordered dessert. We had the ice cream sandwich and it came with a side of fruits and a tiny little bowl of chocolate for dipping. Divine. Others we were dining with had the chocolate mousse and it looked like a gigantic parfait, and looked delicious!  I would definitely go back to this place. Seems like a nice chill place, without the dirty, grungy pub feel. I have to admit it is a bit on the expensive side, but wouldn't mind dishing out the extra dollars for the great food and service."}
{"text":"So was in Calgary for a wedding and we had just landed prepping to head to a wedding at lake louise. Given that it was a an 1+ hr drive, we decided to grab food as a group in Calgary and after a bit of searching was able to land on Brasserie Kensington. It was easy to score a table online and we walked in at around 1:15 for a late lunch. There is plenty of street parking around so just find a spot and make sure to pay at the machines. The joint itself is up a flight of stairs and has an open feel allowing with plenty of tables inside. The servers were all very friendly and brought over menus quickly allowing us to peruse.  As a group we decided to go with the Poutine with foie gras (of course), butterleaf and frisee salad, olive oil pan bread, a French onion soup, and the fried chicken skin. We had dinner planned a few hours so wanted to keep it balanced and these seemed like the right options. The olive oil pan bread came out first which reminded me a lot of a fusion naan with the lemon ricotta being delicious. All the carb lovers enjoyed this small bite. The French onion soup was good and was thankfully not too salty. There was the right proportion of cheese to it so it was good for what we were expecting. The Butterleaf/Frisee salad was refreshing and with the toppings making it a nice balanced salad for both taste and texture. The poutine with foie gras was good although I was hoping it was going to be a bit more unique with flavor. It was still good so don't get me wrong but perhaps just my high expectations. The winner off the table was the fried chicken skin which came with a side of hot sauce which was absolutely delicious. This thing was like crack cocaine and was absolutely addicting for the entire table. I will be honest in saying I kind of wanted to place another order of it but restraint kicked into play.   This was a solid place for food and is in a nice neighborhood allowing the group to walk around a bit afterwards to digest some of the goodness we just ingested. A good place and somewhere I will be back especially for that fried chicken skin."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. Never had a burger that tastes the same as this one. There weren't many people and it was quite loud, so if that's not your thing you'll want to be aware.   There's enough restaurants I want to try that I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"After seeing my friend's food photos on Facebook, I was delighted to find out she was bringing me here for breakfast. Huge disappointment., and I wanted so much to like them.  They have an incredibly diverse menu using fresh local and organic ingredients, including $4.00 organic coffee. The blackboard specials looked interesting and were priced low., interesting stuff too. Eggs Bennie with smoked salmon and guyere, braised pork ribs with potatos fried in duck fat, Lobster something-couldn't read it, and bacon cinnamon buns.  At first our group had to sit at two separate tables, because the only available tables pushed together would cause a traffic flow issue. No problem. Birthday girl ordered a biscuit straight away, knowing it might take awhile to figure out what to order, and to wait for one other person. She spent the waiting time ranting about how awesome the biscuits were and how hungry she was.  As we imagined, ordering DID take awhile. So did finding another table to push together so we could all sit together. My friend and I ordered caesers, which took over 15 minutes to arrive, and still her biscuit had not shown up. And the caesers? Pure Tabasco sauce. I couldn't taste anything else. The waitress promised to look into it, apologizing because they were slammed. That may be true but...  AHEM. At the risk of sounding old and curmudgeonly, that's a crock. When I was YOUR age, your entire restaurant was the same size as my usual section. I did NOT have a bartender or a busperson. I did it by myself, and you and three other girls can't handle your little restaurant?! Really? Sorry...Hell hath no fury like a former waitress receiving bad service.  Birthday girl asked twice about her biscuit, but when our food began to arrive, she angrily told the server she didn't want it anymore. She wanted it 30 minutes ago to stave off her hunger.  I ordered the guyere and egg crepe with horseradish aioli. It was good. It would have been better had it not been cold, and if the potatos were fulled cooked. The horseradish aioli was gone in two bites. Could they spare it? vAnd the salmon wasn't fresh.  When the bill arrived, we requested separate bills. In retrospect, we probably should have made that clear at the beginning. She didn't separate the bills. She DID itemized it for us, you know, to make it easier for us to divvy up, and she remembered to add the 20% gratuity for a table of seven, lucky us. I was so mad, I probably tipped her more than necessary, just so I didn't have to do the math.  Not impressed. I don't mind added gratuities for big tables. I've had monster tables that run a person ragged and leave crappy tips, so I know why it's done. But if I have to pay it, it had better be good service. The wait time wasn't worth it for me. I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"I visited Brasserie in the first week it opened - was not disappointed. My friend and I shared a mushroom poutine and potato skins. Both were excellent. The tastes were vivid, which I love - why eat anything unless it tastes awesome? Instead of little bits, there were big pieces of bacon on the potato skins. Not only is this better for the average diner, but also for me, as I'm a pollo-vegetarian, so I had to pick them off ;)  The drink menu is unique - you won't see your typical beers or ciders on it. A great opportunity to try something new.  The one thing that chafed a little was the \"Q\" water. I drink a lot of water, so it's a necessity at any meal, but I'd prefer not to pay $3 for it. Apparently other restaurants have a similar system but charge less - perhaps Brasserie could consider lowering the cost a little.  Otherwise, I highly recommend a visit, especially for the poutine!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for Saturday dinner. Started out with saffron cream mussels--best I've had to date, they practically melted in the mouth. As if that wasn't enough, I tried the seafood bouillabaisse, and it was an utter delight. Finished off with foie gras and sea salt caramel banana split, just right for two people to share. Mmm. The restaurant exterior may not look like much, but oh, what a pleasant surprise the food was!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends. Nice atmosphere and staff was friendly. Food was seasoned well but a little overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hit this place on a Friday before a comedy show at the Jube. Great atmosphere, relaxed and communal. Food was a take on traditional comfort food. Good place - would go there again."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 1 star for service... average 3 stars  We arrived for a sunday brunch without reservations, they said we could sit at the bar- totally fine with that.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked if we wanted menus. Yes please. We ordered coffees right away. They arrived one at a time, about 5 minutes apart. We thought that was unusual- they were just regular coffees, and sitting at the bar we could see the server just needed to pour 3 cups from a carafe...  Also, the server seemed really annoyed that we asked for cream and sugar, again she brought enough for only one person- like one sugar pack and 1 creamer... what?   Ok, we shrug that off, and order eggs benny and mimosas. The bartender who made the mimosas actually seemed to have worked in service before, and was great. He actually got us coffee refills and brought cream and sugar to all of us without having to be asked!  I will say the food was really great. A good size portion that I could clear my plate but not feel over stuffed. Hollandaise sauce was perfect- not over salted or from a packet like most places offer.   Must have been an off morning, maybe with very new staff around. Like, never been to a restaurant before and so they don't know how to act new. The food was good enough to warrant a second chance, but maybe I will try them for dinner instead."}
{"text":"Went there for an late lunch with the girlfriends. The food was good but the service was not. Both servers seem to have lack of customer service skills. As someone who ran a restaurant, I felt these ladies didn't deserve any tip but I tip for the kitchen... well hopefully the kitchen gets some tips. Unfortunately this was the second visit in a row that service was undesirable. I don't think I would return, even if the food was good. :-("}
{"text":"OH MY POUTINE SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!!!!!  We were going to head to WineBar but the smell drifting down from Brasserie was calling our names .... Do we ventured up instead and discovered BUILD YOUR OWN POUTINE NIGHT - how did we not know this was a thing?!?!?  DELICIOUS!  The only star lost is due to the servers - we've been back once since and still terrible servers. Good food good drinks fantastic owner and chefs but please step up the server game. If I ask them questions about the food - I would like them to answer with more than an \"I don't know\" or \"I've never tried it\""}
{"text":"Had an early date night dinner here.  Reservations online were quick and painless.  Overall the service was somewhat lacking as it took some time to get orders in even though it wasn't too busy.  But they did check in during the meal and also topped off our drinks.  We shared the Foie Gras Poutine.  This is the first time I have experienced foie gras and it was quite the experience.  Melt in your mouth with a ducky tang and saltiness.  It went great with the fries and cheese and gravy.  Perhaps a little bit salty since the fries were seasoned, the foie gras had salty and the gravy had salt.  I still dream about the smell and taste of this dish.  For mains we had the duck breast and the duck confit/rillette.   The duck breast was great, perhaps a little too rare for my preference.  It went beautifully with the crepe, cherry, chanterelle and sauce.   The duck confit and rillette was good but not amazing in my mind.  The rillettes was the highlight of the dish.  The beets were great with the rillettes and confit.  But I found the confit lacking in duckiness, but that could be because we were spoiled by the foie gras poutine and asian BBQ ducks.  Overall, a good place to get your Western style ducking on.  It's quaint and hipster, good for a fancy date.  For us guys, they have TVs facing the bar so you can watch the game."}
{"text":"A friend and I popped in for lunch a couple weeks ago as she works right around the corner from here. I had only dined here twice before - the first time when I wrote my last review - and the second time only for oysters. I was looking forward to giving it another try.  I knew going in that they wouldn't have any wine for me, and I continue to be less than impressed with their selection. However, I ordered a cocktail and that was fine with me. It was a beautiful day and once again we were seated at the window which allowed for some fun people watching. I ordered the burger with a salad, and we also ordered some fries to share.  Since my friend was on a lunch break, I planned for approx an hour and 30 minutes, not thinking it would take that long, but I paid for my parking accordingly to give us some leeway. I met her at Brasserie at 12pm, we ordered around 12:10, and we didn't get our orders until 12:50. I was a little bit annoyed because I knew she would have to rush to eat in order to get back to work. By the time we ate and paid, my parking was up and I had to race outside to leave.   However, the burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had!! I specifically asked to have it well done, as I'm not into rare burgers, but mine was still a little pink in the middle. I would have been scared/upset if it wasn't so damn good. I have had their beef tartare before, which is about as rare as you can get, so I just tried not to think about it and ate it anyway. The patty was juicy, flavorful, and well executed. I also LOVED the grainy mustard, being a big mustard fan. So good! The salad was also awesome, I really loved the dressing...wish I knew what it was so I could make it at home. The fries were so-so, a little sad looking, and I really didn't like their ketchup (not something that should be messed with in my opinion!) but the salad made up for it so next time I will just skip those. I'd definitely come back for lunch if it took less than an hour and 40 minutes, that's just too long on a weekday when people have to get back to work."}
{"text":"Very tasty but..... Went for a birthday party. Specials were plentiful (6-8 of them written on a board by the door) but waiter never mentioned them. One of our group took a photo of the board and read them out. Drink orders were taken slowly and delivered even slower. Entrée orders taken about twenty minutes after drinks arrived. My saffron cream mussels were very tasty but thankfully we live close by or I would have been escorting them out on the side of the road. I have never had the pleasure of such immediate food poisoning. My companions had sandwiches, duck, bouillabaisse, poutine, and my date and I had lovely salads to start. Though the birthday boy wanted to order dessert we were rushed out (somehow the server found his speed when he was ready to go home and the kitchen staff had wiped down).  So, food tasty but there is a quality issue, and service was friendly but distracted/slow/disinterested.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I was here on Sunday with a group of five.  We arrived at 6:30 to a relatively quiet restauarant.  Our group ordered a huge variety of food, most of which I cannot comment on because I don't eat meat.  I will say that if you aren't a meat eater you will have a difficult time here.  Even the fries are bathed in duck fat.  Hard to get away from it here.  I had the croque madam with no ham.  The group ordered poutine fries, pork chops, pork belly, duck, mussels, and a variety of other side dishes as well.  Nothing left on the table when finished.  Their desserts are house made.  The cheesecake was good but had a bit of an odd taste - they must use a cheese that wouldn't usually be expected in a cheesecake.  All in all I probably won't be back but I think the meat eaters in the group really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Brasserie Kensington has a very good balance of upscale chic and laid back pub.  The later it gets, the darker and more romantic it gets. In the early evening it's bustling and lively. They have a very good selection of beer that the men seemed to be very happy with, and a long healthy list of wine that us women really enjoyed. The menu is a bit confusing. I assumed Brasserie would serve specifically French food, but there's a mix of burgers and fries, some French and then....Schnitzel.  The duck poutine was awesome, my fish was ok. Service was also very ok at the most, but the best part was sitting near the window watching the slow relaxed Kensington life.  I definately love the later evenings of the Brasserie, when candles are lit and the whole restaurant gets moody and everyone is having wine and cheese platters. Two different atmospheres, and I definitely love just one."}
{"text":"Dear Brasserie... this review's been a long time coming.  Whenever someone asks me what my favourite resto in Calgary is, it's without an ounce of hesitation that I reply \"Brasserie Kensington.\" It's an ideal mixture of great service, quality food, an amazing wine and beer list (imported), atmosphere, and prices that don't make me swallow hard once the bill comes.  The first time I ever set foot in Brasserie Kensington was about 6 days after it opened last spring. I was there with a crew from Chef Meets Grape. It was this night that I became familiar with the gnome beer (La Chouffe, it took me several visits to remember what it was called, but the fine folks at the Brasserie always knew what I was referring to when I asked for the beer in the gnome glass) and what gets my vote as my favourite poutine in all of Calgary.  This is the kind of spot that makes me want to move into the neighbourhood, just so I'll be within walking distance and can frequent it on a much more regular basis. The only thing that keeps me from the neighbourhood in general is parking. I hate paying for parking. If I can walk, I most certainly will.  What does it do well? Everything IMO. From the slowest of weekday afternoons to much busier evenings and weekends, service here is spot on. And the food is something to yelp home about too. I love sitting near the big windows in the front and looking out onto the street. It makes me feel like I'm in a little mountain town.  If you're into poutine, my favourite is the pork hock poutine. But there are 5 kinds in total (even a gluten-free one I think I recalled seeing on my last visit). The fries are cooked in duck fat, and a lot of the gravy is made from duck fat as well. Soooo delicious. *insert drool here*. For niblets, try the onion loaf and pickled treats. At $4 a pop, they make for some lovely bar snacks. On my most recent visit I also ordered the pretzel with mustard. Careful on that mustard, It tastes dijon and it's STRONG! It cleared up my sinuses on the first bite.  For lunch, I suggest trying the lamb burger. Lamb is my absolute favourite meat, and the burger certainly didn't disappoint, while the wild boar burger is worth porking over too.  I haven't had occasion to try any dessert yet, I've always been too full. Dessert and port sound like yet another reason to make my way over here soon... oh and brunch. I keep reading ridiculously good things about brunch.  Keep it comin' Brasserie. You're doing something right! Well... everything actually.  Loves!!!  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge: 5/30"}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back!  A small place on the 2nd floor of Kensington Rd this place is a brasserie (had no idea what that was so i googled of course and it's a casual place that serves lots of drinks!) hahah.   Started with foie poutine. Everything apparently is fried in duck fat which is good for you?! I didnt' know but yayyy for duck fat! hahah.  I asked about the pork burger and waitress recommended it w/ a fried egg on top and she was spot on. It was delicious (plus I added a piece of seared foie which is just pure gluttony!) haha.  My friend totally fell in love her steak and my brother ordered some german sausage dish w/ saukraut which was the only dish we all didn't like (the sausage did not have a crisp snappy skin, it was all just mush - would not order again).  Their side salad was tasty (my friend devoured hers cuz she loved the pickled julienned carrots that were in the salad).  Love that they serve seared foie as a side add on (I'm not complaining but be forewarned it's sliced thinly - I'm just happy they offer it!)  Place has the right combo of great service, great food, great atmosphere, great location! Bring a date here and afterwards, take a romantic stroll down the twinkle lit tree lined street  :)"}
{"text":"Dinner for two tonight. We shared the crispy eggplant and inhouse made potato chips. Loved the eggplant but wasn't as crazy for the chips. Our server was pleasant and non-intrusive. I had the rainbow trout and my friend had the duck breast. The duck tasted amazing and my fish was yummy and very well presented. As always, I've never disappointed here!!!"}
{"text":"Service, food & location was great. We shared brasserie Poutine, cassoulet & croque madame- all super yummy. Overall great experience! Would definitely go back & recommend to others."}
{"text":"I emailed the manager to let them know that the menu on the website was outdated.  It was still outdated last time I checked and I received no reply from the manager."}
{"text":"Read about this little place in John Gilcrist's book and knew I had to try it out!!  100% duck fat in their fryers?  So I decided to go for my birthday and I made reservations for a Thursday night for four. Let me just say from the moment we walked in till we left the entire experience was phenomenal.  The wait staff seated us right away in front of the fireplace, nice and cozy. She brought us waters right away and the wine menu.  We had our drinks picked out and wine ordered within 10mins and the wine was at the table right away and opened and presented professionally. We were told the nights specials and given some recommendations and our order was taken and we were not rushed.  We had the crispy chicken skin and then decided to also try the crispy pigs ears...all to die for!!  Our mains all came out well timed and together nice a fresh and hot.  Our server even suggested adding some pigs ears to our poutine and she was right it added the right amount of crunch.  The house made burger was absolutely outstanding!!  It had a very nice smokey flavor and was a very nice pink med rare!!  Our server even informed us of the fact that it would be med rare when we ordered to ensure we where ok with it.  The best burger I've had to date!  The duck rillettes was fantastic and covered in crispy fried onions and matched perfectly with the foie poutine, the pan seared trout was perfectly cooked and de-bonned, topped with almonds and beautiful green beans.   If you have their fries you have to try their house made ketchup...Heinz there is another keinz...it's fresh tasting and not sweet like traditional ketchup.   We each had a dessert and each tried a different one which was great as we all got to sample them.  All I can say is wow..blown away at the flavors!!  I think my favorite was the vanilla semifredo ice cream sandwiches.  We ordered coffee and I had port, unfortunately our coffees got forgotten but they were great at customer service as they apologized and didn't charge us for the port.   All around this was a fantastic dining experience and I highly recommend it.  Keep in mind I made reservations and it was mid week so the place was not overly busy."}
{"text":"I prefer the brunch menu to the main menu, which I finally had a chance to explore last night.  A few of us were interested in sharing the Confit Duck Leg.  It took ages to arrive and when it did, I realized that sharing means you'll get just a few bites at best and it's not worth $17.  I was more interested in eating the orange garnish.  Some of the girls wanted bread and we ended up with the \"Alsatian Fondue,\" which is a joke.  Don't bother ordering this if you're hungry, as I found it tasteless and also not worth the money.   I'm somewhat of a picky eater so I struggled with the selection of sandwiches and mains.  I settled with the gluten free Fish and Chips.  I realized that without smothering the chips with something like ketchup or gravy, I don't actually like the flavor of the duck fat.  The fish was decent but I could have used more lemon caper aioli for dipping.  I didn't ask for more because I was fearful about what I'd have to pay.  The best item on my plate was the red cabbage slaw.  I was stunned by the flavors because it wasn't something I was expecting but this is unique and stellar slaw worth trying.  It has some kick.    All in all, I wasn't excited about anything I ate except the cabbage.  A sad story for such a nice little restaurant with great presentation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and even better, it's just a short stroll from my house! We've been to the Brasserie's Container Bar, which itself is awesome, and tried their poutine fries bathed in duck gravy. We loved their poutine so much we've been here several times just for beer and poutine. Well we finally made it out here for a proper meal and it was Sunday Brunch. Best brunch in Calgary to date. Wife and I shared the eggs benedict, some of the best we've ever tasted. Our friends had the poutine breakfast (which is basically just poutine with a fried egg) and the crepes, all delicious. And best of all, the serve some strong morning drinks including your traditionals like mimosas and more. Going back here soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my holy steak! Alberta beef with foie gras compote butter on top is a way to this girl's heart (literally and figuratively). Brasserie, you really won me over.   Though the weather was quite nice, my friend and I dined inside at a comfy booth. Booths are always awesome, but when there's wine and rich food involved, they're even better. Sink right into your seat as you enjoy the delectable dishes.  Beyond steak, we tried an appetizer of eggplant and speck. Unique and tasty! Also, I had a cauliflower gratin with the meal. My attempt of getting some sort of veg + meat combo in the belly.  Can I say that butter makes everything better? Foie gras butter melts in your mouth and makes a really good cut of beef that much better. Frites to dip said butter/meat juice in after is just plain gluttonous, in all the best ways possible.  Would I go back? You bet your sweet bippy. Would I share my meal with anyone else? Maybe not :)"}
{"text":"Brasserie has got - hands down - the best burger in town. It checks off so many burger boxes! Juicy, delicious, meaty... The burger isn't even that complicated and it's not compensating with any crazy sauces or toppings. It's just a perfect straight up burger. The poutines are also really good and these guys know a thing or two about beer and brown liquor.  I'm going to include Container Bar (their patio) and say that it is such a cool patio and a totally fun experience to eat and drink when it's sunny or even with a little chill in the air."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. The menu is interesting, it's basically a duck lover's paradise, with a Canadian twist. From foie gras to poutine, literally anything on the menu has a twist of duck."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch this afternoon. .. first time there.  i would have given it 5 stars but the service was horrible!  We received our appetizer AND our meals before our drinks got to the table, and that was after asking about them.  The croque madam was fantastic."}
{"text":"Worst pouting fry order I've ever made. I picked up an order to go, got home and there was no gravy, and 3 cheese curds per order! I will definitely never go here again."}
{"text":"Oh Brasserie, why you gotta be this way?  My friend and I headed out for brunch the day before my birthday.  We knew we didn't want to wait in line somewhere, but we wanted something a litte more glamorous than a donut and a double double - afterall, I AM turning 30 again.  It's dead when we arrive and the restaurant is freezing but our server brings us our coffees quickly...along with ice cold milk and a single packet of sugar.  I don't know about you, but I really enjoy my coffee, I like to savour the creamy richness of it, and pouring ice cold 1% in a good cup of coffee is like eating turkey bacon - it might sound like a good idea, but it's obviously a poor imposter for the real thing.  Our server raves about the french toast and sugary carbs seem like the responsible thing to do since we're both drinking diet coffee.  Our meal arrives and it's gorgeous - 5 pieces of french baguette stacked up in a french toast tower, fruit on each piece and pre-syruped.  Wait a second...pre-syruped?  Well maybe that's just to keep the whole tower together....  We dive in and it's immediately apparent that the Brasserie do not understand my syrup needs.  No worries, our server helpfully brings me another teaspoon of syrup.  My friend is less concerned with syrup, and more concerned with the fact that her knife is unable to slice through the crust-heavy nature of the french toast.  I'm having similar difficulties, what the hell is this crust made of?  We both just pick up a piece with our hands and attempt to eat it that way.  I'll admit it, we should have told the server that the french toast was awful.  Though, our quality check was late because she was drinking wine behind the bar and maybe didn't notice us playing Jenga with our food.  We left hungry and unsatisfied, walked down the street to Crave, got our damn sugary carbs and picked up a hot coffee and felt much better.  The cupcakes helped our mood immensely.  I'm going to chalk this up to ordering the wrong thing but I'm not eager to go back.  Damn you Brasserie, you were on my list of places to go and if you can't make french toast that worries me more than a little bit."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Foie Gras Torchon - Toasted Brioche, British Columbia Peach Preserves, Sea Salt Cassoulet - Duck, Pork, White Beans, Grilled Bread Dark Chocolate & Coconut Bread Pudding - Almond and Coconut Ice Cream, Chocolate Tuille, Pomegranate Seeds  Defining themselves as a \"Canadian Brasserie inspired by local ingredients,\" the menu quite French while the design and high Tea service on weekends lean British, Brasserie Kensington has achieved notoriety by way of its focus on simple, honest cooking and bold flavors, lunch at eleven o'clock on a Tuesday finding the frequently-packed space far less buzzy than usual, the first twenty-minutes spent dining in exclusivity.  Open from Lunch through Late-night, a short flight of stairs placing the heavily wooded dining room above a bar beneath, it was with greetings from a youthful gentleman in buttoned flannel featuring wild animals that 'any seat you like' was offered, the front window looking out on the street from which the restaurant takes its name providing a bit of people watching throughout the course of the meal.  Playing music ranging from White Stripes to The Tragically Hip, a television behind the bar showing American football, it was not long after ordering that a two-ounces of creamy Duck Liver arrived on grilled Brioche, the individualized squares from Rougie perfectly portioned and ideal for sharing with a spoonful of Peach Jam, though fans of Foie Gras will no doubt be compelled to eat the whole thing.  Tempted by plats du jour, an absolute bargain for those looking for a substantial-yet-expedited business lunch, any thoughts of braised local Beef were cast aside the moment Cassoulet entered my line of vision, the small-ish bowl without much Broth still packing quite a wallop with Duck and Pork plus the unmistakable flavor of Offal mixed with soft White Beans stewed with Herbs and Tomatoes.  Making the obvious choice for dessert, the Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake in January producing a chuckle while Earl Grey Crème Brulee is simply not my style, it was with greedy eyes that I starred at the lump of Bread Pudding before diving in, melted Dark Chocolate richly infusing every centimeter of the springy Brioche topped in a slowly melting ball of Coconut Ice Cream with the added bonus of Hot Fudge and Pomegranate Seeds."}
{"text":"We freaking love this place. Go at least once a week and can't stop going back. The steak and scotch egg are to die for."}
{"text":"We ordered a French onion soup each, shared a steak and frite with butter, and a bottle of Merlot.  So happy with the flavors, the service, we invited friends to join us for drinks after and they were accommodating for that as well.  The butter on top of the tender steak was heavenly & came with crispy seasoned fries and delicious green beans.  The French onion soup was good; cooked authentically with crisp baguette topped with melted cheese. A French person would approve.   Beautiful French food with French Canadian accents. It's a lovely spot for great conversation and the Kensington vibe is comfortable, relaxed and unique.  Good spot, good food, great service."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and excellent service!!.. The wine was delicious and The French fries are really good!,. And all appetizers recommended by the chef were great. I would definitely go back there...."}
{"text":"We ordered a brasseries poutine which was salty and the fries on the outside were soggy. For mains we had the daily special which was an undercooked risotto with a buttery piece of cod. We also had the brasserie burger which was weird because the ground beef had the consistency of chalk. The butternut squash soup tasted like someone went overboard with the salt."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! My bf took me here for bday (I picked resto), I was debating between fancy or casual and then I happened upon this gem which I haven't been to in forever! We shared the crispy chicken skins, scallops w pork belly, I had the seared foie gras alllllll to myself and then we split the steak frites (with foie gras butter ohhhhh yessss)!! Everything was fabulous and ever dish was carefully thought out with textures and salt and spice levels complementing every dish! Our server Tiffany was a blast and knowledgeable and super fun! The room is quite warm so dress accordingly, will be back often , love!!"}
{"text":"4/5 Came here for brunch today with a friend from Vancouver. Cute restaurant in Kensington with a friendly atmosphere.  Service was great with lots of coffee refills!  I had the egg white omelette with pork belly, gruyere, spinach, and I also added mushrooms. It was a pancake style omelette  (as opposed to the folded kind) that was well seasoned and came with fried potato, toast, and arugula. Along with the house-made ketchup, I thought it was pretty good! The husband and friend both had the lamb hash and both said it was delicious.... as usual I had a touch of food envy! The portion sizes were fair but not massive... big enough that I had left overs but the boys didn't.    The bill for all 3 of us was just over $90 with 3 caesars and 2 coffees. I think it's a bit overpriced here but the food is decent and the service was good. I'll try and come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Today's review is brought to you by the word: Incredible. The word that was uttered by my Father upwards of 10 times during the meal.   I wish I had all the money and could take dear old Dad out to dine all the time because I don't think he understands everything that comes out of his mouth is sheer review gold.   I've been to the Brasserie a few times before, never a full meal just a beer or two and or some late night poutine. But every time I've been here I have been impressed.   The decor is awesome I am so into the rustic look the boar head above the fire place, so cool and the food is REAL food, good portion sizes and quality ingredients. So I figured it would be a safe place to bring the family.   Way back in December I gave my Dad a \"Free Meal to the Brasserie\" for Christmas and since he knows I am cheap we decided to go out before Father's Day so I couldn't re-gift it. Smart Man.   Anyways, when we got there his face lite up with a smile. Keep in mind we rarely go out anywhere other than Montana's or on a fancy night to Moxie's (nothing wrong with those places but... you know)   So since my brother and I were paying we went all out, appies and everything. We ordered the Duck Fat Potato Chips and dear lord the Salty Chicken Skin. Well I tell you that man was so happy with the Chicken Skin. \"If my old man was still around this would bring a tear to his eye, he would have loved this\" we actually had to get ANOTHER round of Salty Chicken Skin. If I would have known that Chicken Skin was all it took to make him happy I would have just said I'll buy you all the Salty Chicken Skin you want.  Main course time, he couldn't believe it could get better than the Chicken Skin. But it did. As a family we ordered 3 of the Beef Brisket Burgers with fries and one order of the Brass Chicken Club with the Potato Leek Soup. All of these where a S-U-C-C-E-S-S every other word was probably \"incredible\" so I take it everybody really liked everything.   Then to top it all off we got desert. We got the Almond Cheese Cake and the Vanilla Semifreddo Ice Cream Sandwiches. Well what can I say it was all so good. I can't comment on the Cheese Cake cause well I didn't get any. But the  Vanilla Semifreddo Ice Cream Sandwiches, WOW. It came with a warm chocolate ganache that had some salt in it which was such a nice surprise. I think now every time I have chocolate I want to have it with salt cause it really brought it all together.   The only thing I should warn you about is they don't take debit. A little bit of a surprise but that's what credit cards are for, holla. Also make reservations it gets busy.   All in all a really good meal. We have decided this is a place they want to come back to. Good quality gourmet food without the stuffy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food - they are very willing to accommodate dietary restrictions. Went with a group and everyone was really pleased with their meal. Gorgeous desserts."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came on BYOB/free uncorking night and enjoyed a bottle of red with our food. Ordered the duck tenders, burger, rabbit stew, and one of the specials, which was a delicious chicken dish (pictured). Definitely recommend-- I imagine you can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Remember that time I dreamt of going to poutine heaven?  - WELL I FOUND IT IN REAL LIFE!!  I'd love to jump out of the gate raving about the poutine, but like anything you gotta save the best for last - so I'll start at the beginning. We were heading to the Fairy Tales Festival and wanted to try something close by. Sure enough the good ol' Yelp map popped up the Brasserie Kensington to which I started reading. Good reviews, good poutine, Wendy's a fan...ok - I'll try it. We show up and they're full.  However, an awesome looking chick with BRIGHT RED HAIR and shocking lipstick gave us a table for an overdue reso which was perfect. The place isn't huge, it's quite quaint really with nice big front windows and an eating bar as well. I quickly looked around to notice that everyone was attractive (distracting much!!) and the clientele was a huge mixture in ages but everyone looked like they had money and nice clothes. The adorable waitress came by to offer water and take drink orders and of course explain a couple specials. The wine menu was pretty decent and the prices were definitely in a good range. A delicious Malbec was ordered.  I perused the menu - and I was lost. How could I choose? So many unique and weird burgers, so many deliciously described sandwiches and of course a large insert of 6-8 ridic looking poutines. I already knew at this point I would have to come back soon. \"House made onion rings\" sat on the table next to me - and it literally took the inner strength of Superman to not take one (especially considering it was two women and they were \"full\". Pffttt..FIT THEM IN). Waitress returns and we place our orders. I have the hanger steak with peppercorn sauce and poutine on the side - OF COURSE. My cohort in crime ordered the Croque-Madame (which sounds very reminiscent of a drag name) with an extra egg on top. Shortly after ordering another table is delivered a full poutine which is MASSIVE and drenched in delicious gravy. Seriously, if I make it to my meal without eating someone else's I'll be a superstar. (Note: I was particularly hungry before arriving).  The meal arrives and it's a far cry from good. It's pretty fantastic. My steak was really, really good and the sauce was delicious. The side of green beans were brilliant green and crunchy. But what ev's..the POUTINE IS WHERE IT WAS AT. It was the basic version, nothing fancy (start small right). The duck fat fries were the best I might have ever had. Perfect cut size and perfect brown. THE cheese was soo good and melty and the gravy was the best in my life. I don't know how they made it or why it's different, but it was. I couldn't even focus on where I was. I had been transported to the poutine heaven of my dreams. A meal well played Brasserie K. The Croque-Madame across me was actually quite pretty and attractive looking and it went down very good as well. The bread was fresh and toasty and the mound of thin sliced ham with grainy mustard and fried eggs. It was a sandwich very well served.   Service throughout was also at a high standard with water filled every 3 minutes and follow-ups done on everything. Quick watch check and its 15 minutes to the movie - WE CAN SQUEEZE  IN DESSERT. I order a lemon curd tart that was in a buttery delicious shell with a really tart and delicious curd (that I was told later contained tequila). Who knew. Across the table was a peanut butter ice cream served on a chocolate terrine - picture dense, mixture of chocolates and very rich. In a great way.  The bill was paid (note here that the price points are actually that of a food chain like Moxies or Joeys and not overly inflated for any reason, which was nice to see) and we had to jet - movie starts in three minutes.  We had a great experience and were brought to a poutine land I need to revisit. Similar to Mario World 4 - I wanted a super inflated huge poutine that my super inflated belly could enjoy.  I shall see you again Brasserie K. Well done this time.  http://brasseriekensington.com/menus/  *Photos posted of meals"}
{"text":"Our group of 11 arrived for our dinner reservation at 5:50 pm and didn't receive our modest dinners of grilled chicken and veal burgers until 7:16 pm by which we were famished and almost through the three bottles of wine ordered.  The wait was not deserving of the mandatory 18% service charge that was automatically levied.  The food was mediocre and the service ok but not outstanding.  I will not go here again."}
