{"text":"I've been back a couple of times for coffee and a snack, and my experiences have been hit and miss.

Twice the Americanos were not very good, although one of the times the machine itself was having technical issues and not producing hot water or something, so that shouldn't count.  On the other hand, either the coffee should have been free, or simply not offered that day.
The 'free' cookie that was placed alongside the coffee was burnt; not just dark in colour but burnt.  Free is lovely, but edible is better.

On another occasion I did share the fabulous flourless chocolate cake, $9, beautifully plated with raspberries.  It was smooth and decadently rich, with the finest of ingredients evident in the taste; but the portion was a little small for sharing, and $9 is a bit much for just me.  Simply my opinion.

Another time I opted for the banana chocolate chunk muffin which was much more affordable, but was also very dry. It was more biscotti than muffin. Perhaps a few seconds of warming might have it brought it back to life.

 On the other hand, my friend had a mango mousse, also $9, which was amazing: tart and smooth and delightful. We shared our choices, and the tartness of the mango gave the chocolate in the banana muffin a definite boost.  Actually, even the muffin's biscotti-like texture was improved with a swish of the mousse.  So for less than $15 combined, those two desserts worked well together.

Along with a pot of ginger tea - no coffee for me, thanks  - and a leisurely sunny afternoon, the visit to Windup Bird was a positive one.

I'd go back, but I'd be careful in my decisions."}
{"text":"I brought my family here for mothers day.

the manager sat us on the patio without menus then came over and blamed the servers. took our order and brought us drinks and food. 
freshly squeezed apple juice was the bomb and my brother loved his waffles.
my mothers was very pleased with her benedict. 
however my plate had a giant hair across it... ok it happens. 
when they brought me a replacement the manager handed it to me without saying a word and walked away. No apology, no cutlery. I was livid.

The only thing that makes me rate with 2 stars is Marko, the serbian server who understood my swearing, came over to our table and sincerely apologized. 

thank you Marko."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for brunch. The food was terrible as was the service. All in all, it was a total letdown. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to this cafe a few days ago i search of a nice spot to read. I had seen it a few times, and decided to check it out. Was it ever a pleasant surprise! The waitress/barista was extremely friendly, and made me a delicious chai latte. There was ample space and tables to choose from. The decor was cute and artsy, not too trendy, just bright and pretty. Although I didn't order food, the menu looked tasty, and I love that they source local food. I think this will be my new go-to cafe, as it was such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was friendly and prompt. I loved the atmosphere, the server was well informed and helped us choose a great dishes for sharing.  The steak is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Cute litte place, servers are polite and attentive. I always get the egg breakfast with avacado, delicious but sometimes the toast is a bit burned but other times ok. Their Americano is one of my favorite. I enjoy sitting out in the patio. They have some cute plants on each table and everything is so neat, simple but unique. The server made a wonderful tonic water with lime and mint. Overall a great experience and my favorite place to go for brunch. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this new place! We had the ceviche and the Arctic char, and both were amazing.  Great service too."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, POOR SERVICE

I want to like Windup Bird.  And in fact the food is excellent.   However two weekends in a row I have tried doing a late brunch in the afternoon, sat down in plain view, and been ignored for ten minutes.  No menu, no coffee, no nothing.  It seems the cook is experienced, but hamstrung with a serving staff transplanted from another industry entirely. 

Last week I waited it out and enjoyed an excellent breakfast. Like I said, kitchen is great.  But the wait was annoying. This week I pulled the plug at the 10 minute mark and am down the street enjoying brunch at Kaplannski's.  Had coffee and a menu within one minute of sitting.  And they are equally busy.  (75% full.)  It's not rocket science, folks."}
{"text":"I've been appreciating the signage and outdoor aesthetic of this place while passing by on the streetcar for a while, but only got the chance to check it out today while killing time in the area before an appointment. Now I'm kicking myself for not eating here sooner. 

I had the hot stone bowl with seared butterfish -- it was dope. Super healthy options with brown rice as the default on all bowls, and tons of great veggies / kimchi / sriracha-style sauce. 

Great food at a great price with great service and I only waited like, 5 minutes for my lunch -- much appreciated by people on lunch breaks I imagine.  

What sealed the 5-star deal for me though, was the music -- nice 70's jams and even a bit of Jackson 5 :)"}
{"text":"The waffles are amazing! Cute little cafe with a delicious menu. Highly recommended for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one day - ordered their peameal bacon eggs benedict and it was well done; the side of kale was very very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice for brunch and once for just coffee.  I've gotten the eggs benny with smoked salmon and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The latte and coffee were both very good and I tried a gluten free chocolate cake that was surprisingly delicious.  I'm new to Toronto so I'm I like to try new places but it's nice to have this place to fall back on for brunch.  Good ambiance as well in my opinion, small and cozy but I've never seen it fill up."}
{"text":"Having spotted this place a few times, I absolutely loved it's unique appearance. I finally got a chance to try the place when I was meeting up with a friend. 

We sat at the patio and it was a little too sunny for me and there wasn't an umbrella over us, also the owner had mentioned that he didn't set it up properly because he was expecting rain. I ordered myself the lamb sandwich, which is basically a waffle burger. It was superb! My only issue was the the sauce made the waffle soggy. I don't think I would have minded having it in a regular bun because the lamb among with its sauce was so good!

My friend had the chicken sandwich and really loved it. She asked the owner regarding the sauce in it, turned out to be a mango chutney (yumm!). 

The service isn't the fastest but if you have the time and are looking for a place to chit-chat and spend a lazy brunch, this is perfect. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Me and a companion traveled downtown and decided to eat here for lunch before heading off to Snakes and Lagers slightly west of here. We arrived at around 3:15 and the lady at the front asked if we would be coming in for coffee. I said we'd be eating some lunch and she told us that the kitchen usually closes at around 3:00 PM before opening up again for dinner later on in the day. After a quick check in the kitchen she told us that they would still be able to cook. Success!

I ordered the Keema Curry with minced pork and beef ($14) whilst my partner had the Baked Vegetable Loaf open sandwich board ($15). Both dishes came with curried butternut squash soup and three salads as a side.

As the side soup and salads came out, my first impression was that everything looked absolutely gorgeous! The mixed greens had an interesting soy based vinaigrette and bell peppers shaved paper thin. The roasted beets were simply made but absolutely delicious. The curried soup was vibrant and flavorful, slightly sweet with a fragrance of curry without the heat, and was portioned in a tea cup to have just enough to enjoy without being too filled with the creamy soup. The mixed beans were somewhat forgettable, especially compared to the other three. Overall it was a refreshing and amazing start to the meal, especially considering how it was just a \"side\" to the main dish.

My Keema Curry was absolutely delicious. The brown rice it was served with was textured on the tooth but fluffy on the outside. It looked a lot more rustic than the other elegant plating designs. The flavors were reminiscent of home cooking, though executed in a way that I would not be able to recreate at home. I would have to say that this would probably be the least healthy thing on the lunch menu, but the taste was well worth it. The portion size was relatively large, especially considering the sides that came with it prior. Although every bite was flavorful, the portion size made the last few bites not as special as the first. I still finished the plate completely, quite happily.

I took a few pecks out of my companion's veggie loaf. It was a lot more dense than I expected - chock full of nuts, beans, mushrooms - it was texturally pleasing in its variety of ingredients and doneness. It had a killer homemade ketchup on top that made it feel all the more like a coarse meatloaf. It came with three breads, baked in house - nice and crusty with distinct flavors and textures without taking away from the veggie loaf. It also had a homemade jalapeno relish (more tart than spicy) and some pickled vegetables (a really nice palate cleanser) to round out the platter. 

Throughout the meal, the waitress made sure to stop by and make sure we enjoyed our food whilst giving us ample time to each other undisturbed. Our drinks were refilled often. Empty plates were picked up promptly, and the progression from side to main was well paced.

The food was amazing, and the price was reasonable for what we got, there were a few minor problems that may have notched off half a star to a 4.5. What makes me happily give a 5 out of 5 instead was towards the end of my meal when the owner was talking to what I believe was artist about painting a mural, he also talked about the restaurant's plans to make a community garden for the children in the area during the summer time, and to have them cook what was grown inside the restaurant. He seemed legitimately passionate about having that happen. It made my day and makes me wish for more entrepreneurs who work towards actively engaging communities around the city.

TLDR:

+ Absolutely gorgeous food and restaurant decor - thematically bright and fresh.
+ Delicious and well portioned food that makes you feel healthy: Local/Seasonal.
+ Owners that work towards engaging/growing the local community and broader social justice issues.

- The kitchen apparently closes at around 3:00 PM so if you're running for a late lunch, some of the menu might not be available. Go in anyways and maybe you'll be lucky like I was and have them still be running!

5/5 - will go again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. I am so happy that there is finally a restaurant with healthy meals and vegetables (can you believe it!). The service has always been outstanding (servers are genuinely very nice). I came for brunch on mother's day and my mom loved it (and she has high standards). Unfortunately, despite having made reservations they ran out of waffle and pancake mix but made up for it by providing free dessert. They also gave ladies free dessert on international women's day. The ambience is very nice. Many of the meals are also GF. The drinks are delicious (breakfast: mix orange and cranberry, dinner: elderberry cocktail). I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"They already had me at the name, but I don't just judge a book by its cover. I was happy to discover that this cafe is fantastic inside and out. Fresh and local goods galore!

The Blackbird Baking Company bread that came with my tasty faux gratin dish was so good that we got another order on the side.

Whimsical touches abound - even in the washrooms!
 
Definitely go if you want to relax and slow down. At times you may feel like your server has gone looking for a missing cat...

UPDATE: 

I've been here a bunch of times and can confidently say that my prior comment on the service is no longer valid and was a one-off experience with someone who no longer works here. There is now a solid group of 3 fine young things who are friendly, attentive and cool. 

The owner is also fantastic and you can see that he really cares about his business and customers. He has a passion for literature and there are great events going on at the cafe on certain days. 

At this point I have tried a lot of the items on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet. Simple and fresh. Just to name a few:

-avocado and smoked trout salad
-wasabi octopus
-salmon board
-ceviche
-the wonderfully tart passionfruit mousse

There are also special deals everyday (e.g. 1/2 off wine wednesdays where you can essentially get a bottle for $16) and nice touches like a fun children's menu.

See you there!"}
{"text":"I loved my hot stone bowl lunch at the Windup Bird, and my sunny seat on a cold day. Charming but not fussy service. If I still had little children, and lived in Toronto, the non-condescending child-friendly food and cheerful ambience would have put Windup Bird at the very top of my eating out list."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on the weekend. I really like the decor of this little place. It is very warm and inviting. The colors they chose to use in the space makes it fun, hip, and cheery. The staff there was friendly. The food quality was very good and the portions are just right. I ordered one of the egg bennys. The ingredients hey used were fresh and I overall just really enjoyed the food and the experience. I would definately come back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to venture to Toronto for a few days over winter break in order to bar-hop a little bit and take in some of the Canadian hospitality we'd heard so much about.  For the most part, this trip was a fantastic idea, and everywhere we went we were greeted with a healthy mix of good food, better drinks and even better people.  The Windup Bird does not fall under any of these categories.

Upon entering, the sweet, cooing sounds of indie rock radio drifted into our ears as a young, disconcertingly perky waitress ushered us to sit anywhere we wanted.  This would have been a nice gesture had the restaurant not been completely empty and devoid of any sort of interior lighting whatsoever.  We eventually found our way to a hap-hazardously arranged table with mismatched chairs and plates, which immediately set a precedent for the rest of the evening.  

Our \"menus\" were brought to us swiftly, however all it consisted of was two sheets of printer paper stapled at the corner with a smattering of food-sounding items that all possessed the common theme of \"vague and vaguely threatening sounding.\"  When your place of business offers more appetizers than entrees and they all sound more appealing than the main courses, we have a  problem.

Before I continue, allow me to insert the fact that my girlfriend and I  both possess absolutely sublime abilities to shrug off even the most infuriatingly incompetent situations in any public forum.  Something about the Windup Bird, at its core, spiritual level however, is just off.  Off in the sense that its aura is dark and brooding, like a hand hovering above the nape of your neck in a cold basement out in the country.  Throughout the entirety of our meal, a small child who appeared to hold some sort of authoritative position in the restaurant's hierarchy was either glued to a laptop screen or prancing around the dark corridors, emulating a Grudge meets Bananas in Pajams type nightmare-fuel.

I got up from the table and braved through the darkness to the bar to get us some drinks, under the pathetic hopes of calming our nerves and making an already unbearable experience just a little better.  I returned, all limbs intact, with a Gin and Tonic and some tall, $15 fruity beverage.  All things considered, these were not bad drinks, but all things considered who can really, truly fuck up a Gin and Tonic?  In fact, if they were somehow able to inherently ruin one of life's most simple pleasures, I would be tempted to raise the above star rating out of sheer amazement at their diabolical stupidity.

It came time to order our food, and through what I would imagine was a fleeting hope that conditions would improve, we ordered two appetizers (the curried butternut squash soup and the \"seafood platter\"), and two \"hot pots\" (one vegetarian and one with \"sausage\").  The appetizers came very quickly, much to our brief pleasure, and honestly the soup was fantastic.  The conditions I would set for visiting this restaurant would be that if you find yourself on College St., somewhere up in the 300's, and you are absolutely craving curried butternut squash soup (AND NOTHING ELSE), this would be the place to go.  However, I'm sure that Progresso has some equally delicious and more affordable options awaiting you at your local supermarket.  

My girlfriend and I ate most of the seafood platter, but neither of us were impressed with its muddled and confusing arrangement and bland taste.  Again, go to your local supermarket, pick up some scallops and shrimp, douse them in butter and lemon, keep them chilled, and you'll create an identical experience for half the price and three times the dignity.

When our \"hot pots\" came, we were greeted with two  bowls filled with beef stock and loaded with confusing, flavorless chunks of vegetables that had been boiled to the point of death.  The \"sausage\" in mine heavily resembled my beloved Jones brand microwavable breakfast sausage from my early childhood.  Heartwarming in a perverse way, sure, but holding absolutely no place in a \"nice\" restaurant.  The phrase \"Fisher Price's 'My First Stew'\" seems far more fitting than \"hot pot\", which I always considered to be a titan of Asian drunk-food, not a bowl of slop served under the guise of \"French Delicacy\".

Our $75 bill and our waitress' confusion as to how her portable credit card reader worked were the final nails in the coffin.  The Windup Bird is piss in a champagne flute, glorified street food served in a golden chalice in the dark.  While their intentions were pure, I'm sure, the sheer gall to serve such utterly reprehensible food under such a hefty price-tag is nothing short of bewildering, if not insulting.  Avoid this place like the Bubonic plague.  Stay home, make some soup for yourself and light a couple of candles.  You'll get the same homey experience they're going for without feeling like your home is one people definitely, definitely got murdered in."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with two friends, one of whom is both vegan and cannot have gluten and the rest of us are not. We selected Windup Bird Cafe as they are able to cater to all of these dietary needs. 

The restaurant is quite quaint with quirky decor - mismatched side plates, bright and vibrant paintings, etc.

We were greeted warmly, and although we had a reservation, it was not at all necessary as there were only about two other tables occupied, so we were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The server was very sweet and when she heard that it was our first time there, she was eager to tell us all about the concept of the place and the various events that are held there. 

I had items 1 and 2 as my main. Items 3 and 4 come with a small serving of the butternut squash soup and a very small tasting of each of the three salads in the 3-kind salad.

1) 3-Kind Salad ($9 - baby arugula w/micro-sprouts, mixed bean, & roasted Ontario beets - vegan and gluten-free)
This was a good dish. The beets could have been roasted slightly longer to become more tender and they could have been seasoned a bit better. 

2) Curried Butternut Squash Soup ($7)
I was really looking forward to this dish as I had read some rave reviews on Yelp. It was a cold day so I was hoping for the soup to be pipping hot. It was definitely warm, but I would have liked it to be that temperature where you just have to give a gentle blow on the spoon before you have your first few sips. You could definitely taste the curry and the soup had a bit of a kick. There was definitely something added to the soup, and I'm not sure what it was (maybe potato?) that muted the flavour of the butternut squash, and I did not like this aspect of the dish. I did not like the bread that was served with the soup. It was more like crostini and it was rather crunchy. I would have preferred soft and fluffy bread that I could have dipped in my soup.

3) Vegetable Keema Curry ($13 - Stewed celery, mushroom, chickpea, onion, carrot, sweet bell pepper - vegan and gluten-free)
This dish was served with brown rice and there were generous portions of both the rice and the curry. I had a taste of my friend's dish and you could definitely appreciate the flavours. There was a strong hint of cinnamon, so if you are averse to cinnamon, I would avoid this dish.

4) Open-Faced Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich ($16) 
This was a chicken breast that was sliced (and appeared to be sprinkled with cinnamon, among other seasonings) served alongside 3 large pieces of bread. The pickled vegetables that the menu's describes consisted of about four small spears of vegetables. There was also a balsamic glaze on the plate as well as three small side dishes of spreads for your sandwich (butter, grainy Dijon, and a red sauce that looked to be spicy). 

The prices were a bit steep for a lunch, but you get a decent amount of food, so it's not bad. However; for a similar soup and salad combo, I would go to the nearby Hibiscus on Augusta Ave for, in my opinion, a much better squash soup and more flavourful salad bowl for about half the price of the soup and salad here.

Our waitress came by after we paid and asked if we wanted some complimentary freshly squeezed juice. She offered us orange, apple, cranberry, or strawberry-basil. We decided to try the strawberry-basil and the cranberry. The strawberry-basil was quite nice and refreshing, and it was the juice we all preferred. The cranberry was fine, but it does not taste like typical cranberry juice. It smelled a bit odd and was not tart or sour like I was expecting when you eat fresh cranberries. Upon asking the waitress about this further, she explained that they do not actually make the juices there, but rather purchase them from another company, and that sweetener was added to the cranberry juice.

I would likely return to this restaurant again, although I will probably stick with Hibiscus as my go-to for a soup and salad combo in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! And the service is even better.

The espresso is on par with other quality coffee shops in Toronto. 

I highly recommend checking out this new coffee shop on College Street."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Windup Bird ever since I found out about its existence a few months ago - anything whose name bears reference to Haruki Murakami's best novel deserves a chance in my book! I ended up finally getting there for a meal with my mum last Thursday evening. (We'll definitely be back to try their brunch at some point, as it seems that's what this lovely little cafe is really good for.)

Overall, Windup Bird made for a very pleasant dinner out. It has a nice, relaxing atmosphere, and our server (as well as a man who I believe was the owner) was really lovely, though he did have a tendency to disappear on us (perhaps inspired by a certain missing Japanese cat?). Some items on the menu ran a bit higher on the scale, but nothing I saw seemed overpriced, with the most expensive entrées (such as the beef tenderloin) clocking in at around $20. 

We both had the soup of the day as an appetizer, a roasted root vegetable soup which was a little bit salty for my taste, though still a nice start to the meal. My main was the lamb burger with fig and lime chutney ($13.95), while my mother had the hot stone rice bowl with pulled pork (also $13.95). My burger was juicy and tasted great, but unfortunately lost its structural integrity fairly quickly - the chutney topping made the bun (initially nice and crispy) so mushy I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The side salad that came with it was surprisingly tasty, but my favourite part of the meal was definitely the duck fat fries - some of the best fries I've tasted! My mom enjoyed her rice bowl, too, though she said it was spicier than she'd anticipated. The pork seems to have been the best part. 

We both tried the dessert sampler to finish off our meal. Oh my goodness. If you need to pick just one course to eat at Windup Bird, then please, let it be dessert! Our plates came with a little cheesecake, a pie square, and their signature gluten-free chocolate cake, along with some cream and fresh berries, and every bite tasted incredible - I could have eaten three of those samplers. The delicious decaf latte I had with my dessert was just icing on the cake.

Bottom line: Good food, fantastic dinner, nice but often absent service. I hope to be back to try more of their menu sometime - like I said, brunch will definitely be happening soon!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Artsy, casual, and cute
Food: Fresh, visually appealing, and tasty! Kale served on the side with the \"Benny\" was fantastic.
Service: Very pleasant and quick (although we were relatively early for brunch)
Would surely come back!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch this past weekend on a Saturday around 2pm (which was their last weekend their nice sized patio was open). I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of the food served as well as how inexpensive it was for brunch (well, if you don't drink booze - my friend's mimosa was $9 which is close to what our dishes cost).

Our server was attentive but was not particularly friendly and seemed incredibly bored. Perhaps it was just an off day for her, I'd have to go back again to see.

The food was really good. I had a smoked salmon benny that came with avocado on it and sides of sauteed kale and potatoes. The potatoes were seasoned perfectly. My friends both got a sandwich, one with chicken and one with fish. I'm told they were very good and they would both order them again. 

I think we'd all return again; it seems to be a pretty popular neighbourhood spot. And while I'm not vegan or vegetarian, they seemed to have at least a couple options for both."}
{"text":"This is a really cute, casual place to enjoy some healthy food and relax! I came here recently with a group of friends and we ended up staying much longer than expected because we really liked the vibe here and the atmosphere is unhurried and cozy. I love the name, as I'm a Murakami fan myself and \"The Windup Bird Chronicles\" is one of my favourite books! They have literary quotes on the walls and were playing the \"Amelie\" soundtrack:) 

There is a small wine list, with reasonable prices. I opted for an almond tea latte instead, which was comforting on a cold day and came with honey. The menu has a bunch of soups, salads and for mains you can go with a hot pot, broken sandwich, or more traditional main course that comes with veggies and sweet potato millefeuille. I went for the hot pot, which was hearty but not too heavy. It was a tad salty for me, but that is probably just me (I often find restaurant food too salty). It had a nice assortment of veggies and sausage, with fresh bread on the side. We also shared the tofu and avocado gratin appetizer, which was a very unique and unusual dish that was really tasty! For dessert, we shared the flourless chocolate cake and berry cobbler. Both were delicious and light. 

The service was excellent. We were served by Sang Kim, the owner (of Yakitori Bar), who had lots of recommendations and was clearly enthusiastic about the food and the place. He split the bill and put the shared items (appetizer, desserts) on a separate bill, which was very thoughtful. Most restaurants insist on one bill for a group over 4 people. I also like that they take reservations through Yelp! On a weeknight, we didn't really need the reservation as there was space, but it's nice to have the options for busier nights. I will be back to try more of the menu and also to try their brunch! I would also imagine that during the morning/afternoon, it would be a nice, quiet place to read."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't understand why it's not full ALL THE TIME. Their brunch options are unique and all delicious. The service is always friendly and responsive. Good coffee, lattes, etc."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of business move in and straight out of this location. Anyone remember this used to be a Kebab house not even 4 years ago?

But man oh man, I really hope Wind Up Bird ends up having longevity here. I really like Wind up Bird Café. When I saw Q Space close down (that place looked and felt sketchy...) and the Wind Up start renovating, I immediately got a good feeling, I was excited, I was ~feeling the vibes maaaan~

So in my excitement, I read up a few promo reviews, and made a date with my best buddy to grab some late evening eats on a Saturday. Just in-case, I called ahead and made a reservation and the girl on the phone was super accommodating and sweet. SO 8 PM rolls around and best bud and I step into the joint and its basically empty (which made me slightly sad). But the girl on the phone remembered my name and graciously joked that almost any seat in the café was available to us, so we sauntered all the way to the back and got settled. 

Menu's were already at the table, as well as two cutesy mismatched side plates with cutlery. Oh, and to the guy who wrote a review here and was all like \"wah wah wah, the menu is 2 stapled pieces of paper wah wah,\" well duh, with a rotating menu that reflects ingredients that are in season, you better damn believe that menu is going to be changing consistently. It's not exactly cost effective to be churning out a brand spankin' new menu all the time to APPEASE YOUR ROYAL TASTE PAPER NEEDS. At least the paper was nice and fresh with no stains. But it would be cool if Wind up came up with a neat concept that elevated their uber simple menu presentation. The space is bright, but the lighting is subdued which made for a cozy feeling.

Since I was on a budget, I opted for their Curry Butternut squash soup, the Berry Crumble and a nice pot of their loose leaf rooibos. My friend had one of their cocktails, the broiled chicken, and the flourless chocolate cake.

THE FOOD WAS AMAZEBALLS. You can tell a lot of love, thought, skill and finesse went into every single thing that came to our table. SO yea, the price points are a little up there for the sandwich boards and mains, but it is seriously worth it. My soup had nuanced flavor profiles and had a nice balance of curry and what I think was Rosemary? They also give it this nice thickness with what I think is some type of bean? Straight up one of the best soups I've ever had.

My friends broiled chicken was awesome too. It came with a dainty side of steamed veggies which had the perfect crunch and they also fashioned a savory meille en feuille out of different types of potatoes that was subtly seasoned and a treat to eat. Her chicken was moist and marinated to perfection.

The desserts are made in house and yea, They. Are. Good. Appropriately sweet, rich and usually served with a dollop of fresh cream. Simple. Elegant. Want. More. Now.

We felt really well taken care of, our server was informed about the menu, as well as attentive, the owner of Wind up floated around and over to ask how our meal was going - GREAT BTW, and I'm assuming the well behaved little girl was his offspring and she was the coolest! My friend forgot her ring in the washroom during our dinner, and this wonderful child came over and politely asked if the ring she found in the bathroom was ours. LIKE COME ON. GO YOU AWESOME KID. GO YOU PARENTS. GOOD JOB EVERYBODY.

The only teeny tiny little criticism I do have, is that they need to change up their sound track approach. I'm pretty sure they played a Botticelli duet about 5 times in the hour and a half we were there. And I get it, listening to Botticelli's voice is like having 5 of the softest baby doves caress your soul with their feathers. But sometimes you just want to hear something else...

However, will be returning here as often as I can to enjoy the gracious energy, amazing food and all around awesomeness that is the Wind Up Bird Café."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. My first venture here was because it was recommended as a family friendly place and we were to meet up with another family. We had brunch in the summer here and high chairs and children's menu were available which was great. Staff was very pleasant and helpful to interact with. Food was good. First time was on the patio and there were a lot of bees which was annoying, otherwise a good time. They don't get too busy which I prefer also. Second time was for a birthday and again, good scores all around. I do recommend this place, I just hope it doesn't get too popular so I can still get a seat when I go!"}
{"text":"I came back here twice this week - and it never let me down.
I had a chicken waffle sandwich for my first visit, and I was truly satisfied. The sandwich had the right type of balance in the combination of waffles, syrup, chicken karaage, and the spicy sauce. To me, the spicy sauce is particularly a huge kick. I think they mixed it with something like hummus. It was really flavorful.
The sandwich comes with green salad & fries, and they were on point - the dining experience was really great.

As for my second visit, I ordered the kimchi benedict again. Ahh, I just love it."}
{"text":"Cute place to dine right at the corner of College and Borden. The decor is a bit quirky but fits the name of the cafe nicely. Fresh flowers on the table and bright decor. The patio was nice too with real candles.

Service was amazing. Only one server and the owner running around. Our water glasses were constantly refilled. Very friendly people as well. The owner was interactive and joking around with his guests.

The food was great. Had the falafel which were delicious. Side vegetables were cooked nicely and very flavourful. Desserts weren't overly sweet. The mango cheesecake was unlike traditional cheesecake (not as creamy) but still good! 

Overall I would definitely come back if I was in the neighbourhood. Has a cute vibe and fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Came here as a group for dinner, and tried their duck fat fries, butter fish bibimbap, and passion fruit mousse.  Comfort foods with considerate menus that have specific gluten and vegan details.  I think the bibimbap's egg was not a \"real\" egg because its texture seemed different from eggs I normally eat (and I eat a lot of eggs), but I will have to try another time to be sure.

Did not rate it a 4 out of 5 because bathrooms are inaccessible."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The restaurant decor is adorable and they have an interesting fusion menu. I came for brunch today and ordered the veggie Benny. The hollandaise was obviously not made in house which is pretty rare to come across these days, and the eggs had runny whites on the inside :( the food just wasn't up to snuff, it was mediocre at best.

Also our server decided that chatting with a table at the back for 10 minutes was more important then bringing the bill for us and the table behind us. 

Maybe dinner is better? I would go back to test out their dinner menu before writing this place off entirely"}
{"text":"Most recently ordered the 2 Eggs for brunch- would order again. Asked for sausages and was disappointed that it was two, quarter pieces of a sausage. 

Have had the Kimchi Egg Benedict's and those were divine- the poached eggs were perfect. 10/10

Had the Avocado and Brie (IIRC) Waffle Sandwich and wasn't a fan of the black sauce.... Fish one was ace, but it seems to have changed since the last two times I've had it (addition of egg tartar & variation of coleslaw as opposed to daikon?). Asked and the owner said he'd customize it in the future which was very generous."}
{"text":"Great little spot we stopped at for brunch.   Lovely presentation and portion for the breakfast served with lightly cooked kale and the home fry type potatoes had diced peppers and a great heat from the spice they used.  Service very good.  Was a little bit of a wait as it seems to be a local hang out for all.  Very kid friendly with menu just for them.  Would defiantly stop here again and maybe come at night for their Raw (almost) menu."}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere, the soundtrack for eating was a great eclectic mixture from Queen to Nina Simone. Awesome friendly service and the price is great for deliciously healthy soul food.  
Highly recommended if you want a good breakfast with a side of hipster."}
{"text":"started with a poached pear and goat cheese salad shared between my boyfriend and I ... Then The pulled pork bowl and my bf had the spare ribs. Was fantastic!! Service had a slow start, but there was only two people manning the restaurant and it was a full house"}
