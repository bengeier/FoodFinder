{"text":"We love this place. They serve Sri Lankan and Tamil for and snack. Taste wise the dishes are extra spicy and hot, but they are unforgettable. Their Samver is really good"}
{"text":"Horrible food.. They give you food from 2 days heated up microwaved!, bunch of drunk people working in the back.. The guy at the front looks drunk .. I don't even know what's happening there I would think twice before buying food from there."}
{"text":"Have been here few times. Love to go here for the spicy food. The outlook of the place needs a little (I mean a lot of) work. There is a big rice dish that they make as a special during the weekends. It is awesome.  The drop in stars are due to the venue rather than their food."}
{"text":"One star is way to many star for this disgrace of a restaurant.   Friend of mine and I went to dinner here last night, and what a disappointment.  Just walking in it looked like a trash dump.  The owner of this place has no pride of ownership over this place.  It was like a sewer infested back alley of a third world hookerville.  Next we ordered some food, after trying to get some recommendation from the guy behind the counter, but it was like pulling teeth, as he was having a - \"I really don't give a crap\" attitude.  His answers were completely nonchalant, and did not want to help us.  After we order, like 15-20 min later, we don't see anyone or hear from anyone.  We only see the television running, fyi TV was next to the food serving area, as it was the most prominent thing that was situated there, and the owner/whoever he was, intensely watching tv, while completely don't care about what was going on in the restaurant.  Let's face it.  This place is straight out of some kind of National Geographic show on third world misery.  It was straight getto.  The food was ready made sitting on metal serving containers, smelling like it was sitting there for days.  It was a mystery why they took so long to bring out food that was already sitting on the counter.  There was bits of paper and trash everywhere on the floor.   I grabbed my friend and we walked out of this getto before they brought the food, which have not come after like 15-20 min, with workers only watching television.  Places like these should shut down, and do us all a favor by selling instead something else more useful, like pokeman cards.  That would be FAR better than what they were selling and serving, which is - I don't give a s*** sandwich.  BB"}
{"text":"I was on my way back home from my Psychologists office when I saw this little restaurant out of the corner of my eye. Surges of emotional thoughts of hunger raced throughout my mind. Lol.  No seriously. Been here before for short eats . They were tasty delicious. The last three trips to this hidden gem have been for the Thali. Seating is very limited so get there early.  Lol. Just kidding. There are three to four tables there if you want to eat in. I ate In my second visit but have now resorted to getting my Thali takeout styles.   It can get a bit cramped if you eat in.  But if you like to look at other peoples backsides then by all means, eat in.  . I recommend that you get there by noon.  That is when they have the full spread out for display on the hot and cold tables.   It all looks so good.  The thali cost me 7 buck tax in. The intimidating yet super nice man (I am guessing he is the owner) working behind the counter will hook you up if you order the thali. You can go all veg or veg and meat. Come hungry because the takeout container is going to weigh about 5lbs when he is done filling it up.  I am so serious. You can feed four people (who don't mind each other's fork spitties) from this one takeout container. I personally can't even begin to name what type of veg dishes that he puts into the container, but they are all so very delicious. Don't worry peeps, no language barriers at this restaurant.  We all speak the language of food love.  Oh yeah before I forget, if you like the spice this place is for you. I still have to try other dishes like the Dosa, Koththu and my other SIndy faves. If you try them first, tell me what your thoughts are.   Oh, I was to scay to take pics of the interior of the restaurant. Like I said earlier, limited seating and backsides. You will understand when you get there. Peace out fellow Yelpers. Did anyone just hear that sound?"}
{"text":"Are you looking to expand your epicurean delights? If so this is the place to go. It is one of the best Sri Lankan carry outs I have tried when in Canada.  The combination of flavors and textures are amazing. The mutton rolls are divine. The spicy meat filling with just the right amount of potato, wrapped in  delicate pancake then breaded and fried to an crispy golden brown.  The fish patties are good also. They are the Sri Lankan version of an empanada but with a more delicate crisp wrapper.  Great with a side of ketchup.  My favorite though is the String Hoppers, typically called Add to dictionary. Is a rice noodle that is steamed to perfection and eaten with coconut sambal and soothe, a milk gravy made with onions , green chilies, tomatoes and turmeric powder.  They also sell a varieties of curries.  I have yet to try those yet but do plan too. This is a must go to place if you are going to be in the Mississauga area.  Great food and nice staff."}
{"text":"In all good conscience, I cannot recommend this place, AND I never even got to eat here.  Sorry, @Benny K!  Came in for dinner tonight with fellow Yelper, Billybob L.  We sat down, decided on a couple of \"sections\", a roti & a curry, and I thought that I'd ask obese chap, wearing a grease stained shirt, behind the counter for recommendations.  Most, normal restaurant owners are more than happy to do that, right?  WRONG.  This dude was soo busy watching some Tamil drama, that he looked bothered when I asked him about some of his dishes.  (Btw, I honestly don't think he was the owner, as no business owner would treat customers like this guy!)  Food was on chafing plates and he just turned the ladle and muttered, \"fish, chicken, beef, mutton\", etc.  No enthusiasm, no nothing.  So after he showed us what was what, we ordered...or at least we thought we did.  I also asked for a Ginger Tea and he said, rudely, \"No, that's for Breakfast!  Can you not see where it's listed??!!\"  Yes, granted the tea was listed under Breakfast between 8-10am (or whatever), so that means you cannot and will not serve it??!!  Then, I go to order a Homemade Mango Juice, NOT under the Breakfast menu, and pointed out to him, \"I can order this, right?  It's not under 'Breakfast'!\"  He muttered something and said, \"We do not have that now!\"  Very bizarro, kinda comical, yet sorta sad interaction.  So we sat down and caught up for a few minutes.  I look up and thought to myself, geez, this guy is not preparing anything, he just sat back down to watch his Tamil show.  And that's when we realised that he had no interest in serving us, so we left!  He was serving other Sri Lankans for takeout, but didn't really appear to have much enthusiasm or friendliness in serving them, but at least he gave them whatever they asked for.  Terrible and ignorant customer service.  Will not be back!  Rather go to my Sri Lankan friend's house where I am treated like a welcomed guest and not a pest!"}
