{"text":"Went by here for the first time after reading great reviews.  All I have to say is that it lives up to hype. Had the po boy and tried the chicken sandwich. Great flavors. Substantial size. Probably the best po boy I've had in the city. The shrimp and the calamari was seasoned nicely and had a nice kick. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard great things from a friend who works in the vicinity. I had the po-boy with spicy slaw. Very welcoming and knowledgeable service. Sandwich was above my expectations and Im a self proclaimed foodie. 
Everything was made fresh and the cilantro was the perfect touch.

Do it."}
{"text":"Yo this place is no joke... Chicken sandwich...yo son that shit is crazzzzy off the hook"}
{"text":"For starters sandwiches are my thing. Whenever I go out to grab a bite, I'll either get a wrap or sandwich and Brock Sandwich knows their shit!

While browsing blogto, I saw that Brock Sandwich got rated one of the best cheap eats  in Toronto for 2013 so I decided to check it out today and it did not disappoint. Luckily I went with someone, so we decided to split our meals and share our sandwiches. I got the turkey club and he got the buttermilk chicken with a side of fries. Both sandwiches were bomb! Like insanely good! Just thinking about them now is making my mouth water. Personally I liked the turkey better, but both were great. The fries were pretty good as well and everything was reasonably priced.

The night before I got to experience the Parts & Labours burger, which got rated Best Burger in Toronto and I would say these sandwiches are on par with that burger, if not better!

When it comes to the shop its pretty tiny, but has a great atmosphere and a super friendly staff.

If you're looking for a quick bite, thats cheap and super yummy, I'd definitely check out Brock Sandwich! As I write this, I can't stop thinking about that turkey club, it was so good! I know I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"*  I had the Chicken Piri Piri

Title:  A Slight Disappointment 

2.5/5 Stars
Get's a pass
Lacks in flavor which is a disappointment since the sandwich \"looks\" well packaged 
The bun was nice and soft
The bacon added some nice flavor to a bland sandwich  
The chicken had a nice crunch on the edges
Sauce and charred onions did not stand out well with this sandwich 
I would order this burger again BUT I would jazz it up with some personal sauce from home to give it better flavor"}
{"text":"I like all of the sandwiches here and they make a good espresso too. I personally recommend the strip bacon sandwich. This is my hangover cure."}
{"text":"So I just ate the Seafood Po boy and it was okay. They only gave me one likkle shrimp and three small pieces of calamari. If you want to order from there I advise that you get the chicken pri pri. I haven't tried but I'll give it a try when I go back there and update you all. Just hope I don't have this same experience again."}
{"text":"The jackfruit pulled pork sandwich was interesting and a bit more acidic than I was expecting. I've never had jackfruit before, but I'm sure this would be delicious for any vegetarian or vegan who has eaten something similar. The salad was tasty with beets, greens, and vinaigrette and I was impressed that the fries remained crispy despite taking it to go. Overall, tasty food for a lunch or snack, but price and portions don't quite match up for a dinner meal."}
{"text":"A friend moved into the neighbourhood and after a very sweaty day of moving we decided to explore the area and grab a bite to eat. This place struck a chord with us and I was accompanied by four stinky boys and they just wanted something really hearty to eat. Although I didn't end up getting any of the sandwiches, (I ordered the poutine) I did get the chance to take a nibble out of all of their orders. The group had ordered a Poy Boy sandwich and a Pulled Pork sandwich. 

The Poy Boy was oh so good. The seafood, especially the calamari was incredibly tender and flavourful and the pulled pork was large, juicy and delicious. My order of the poutine was also very good and the gravy used was something I was no accustomed too. The definitely made it themselves but the flavour was a little more tangy than most traditional gravies. I enjoyed it and really liked the taste of it as did my fellow friends. 

The food is made to order so it does take a little while for preparation, which I am okay with especially if the food is as good as it is. I will definitely be coming back here again. I believe they change their daily menu consistently!"}
{"text":"Listen, I'm not gonna run out and change my name to \"Brock J. Sandwich\" or anything, but their crispy chicken offering was a darn good gnosh. Skillfully dredged, fried, garnished and bunned, this sandwich, while hardly audacious, had its ducks in a row! The Piri-Piri sauce could be spicier, but heck, couldn't we all!"}
{"text":"Amazing. First time here, tried the piri fried chicken sandwich with a side of fries. Totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"Probably best sandwich place. I literally inhaled the pulled pork. Whoever says its \"meh\", gotta check your taste buds. One of the best, well rounded lunch places."}
{"text":"Great fresh sandwiches, reasonable prices, friendly service. Be prepared to wait a little longer than at a typical sandwich joint as they make everything fresh to order. My favourite is the chicken but the beef cheek is also incredible, and their fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"These guys always deliver amazing Sandwiches. They usually have something new on the menu to dazzle your taste buds. Best Sandwiches in city!

The only sandwich that was average was the piri piri chicken.  Maybe not my style.  Pork Prochetta, Back Bacon and pulled pork were so tasty.

The burger is the best that I have had to this day.  

Their new Po Boy is the only Po Boy that brings me back to my trip to New Orleans.  They may do it better at Brock."}
{"text":"We were craving some tasty sandwiches and had read about this spot online. It did not disappoint,we had the crispy chicken and the chili beef.  I highly recommend the fries and and some malt vinegar mayo. They  give you a jug of chilled water and some cups if you're dining in which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches around. They are fresh and wonderfully flavourful. The service is always friendly and speedy. 

I'm with Anthony s in that I'd rarely pay $11 for a sandwich but I was hooked on the first one. The Po Boy is so good I find it hard to want to order anything else, and I'm happy to hand over $11. 

My mouth is watering just writing this!"}
{"text":"I toured canada  the past summer !
This place has the BEST brisket sandwich you will ever come across your entire life .
As I told the man who asked me how was it : I said sir : your sandwich has descended from heaven , it was divine .
That brisket sandwich is second to none. This is coming from a guy who samples brisket sandwiches a cross North America  and try to find the best  !
I sometimes contemplate the Idea of flying to Toronto from south Florida , just to go to that place !"}
{"text":"Really delicious sandwiches. I suggest the peameal bacon they serve on weekends. Delicious. 

Not a lot of seating space, so don't bank on being able to sit down."}
{"text":"I ate at this place today for lunch, and I just couldn't wait to get home and write a review about it! This place, was amazing! It seems like a simple shop with just a few sandwiches, but the quality of food is the best I've seen in a sandwich shop. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The sauce on the pork was tangy and sweet, and it was topped with creamy coleslaw that was just amazing. The prices were great too. I also ordered fries which are seasoned with a blend of spices that make them more than just ordinary  fries and the portion was enough to fill two people. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good sandwich with quality ingredients. The staff are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Loved all 3 times I've been. Friendly, good price, amazing sandwiches. As soon as we walked in we felt like a regular. Welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Tried the pork, the mahi mahi, and an order of fries. Was about $30 bucks. 
The food gave me a very strong feeling of \"meh\". Especially disappointed with the fish! Not that these sandwiches are horrible, but they certainly don't compete at a $10 sandwich level. #sorrynotsorry

Only one small table and some countertop to sit at, so more of a take it and go spot."}
{"text":"This place makes my favourite chicken sandwich. Soft bun, chicken that is crisp, fresh, with just a hint of heat, topped with crunchy lettuce and sweet grilled onions. I literally walked an hour and a half with my girlfriend to get here and it was worth it!

My girlfriend had a sausage patty sandwich, with fried egg and roasted tomato in too. Had a bit of a breakfast feel, much milder than the chicken sandwich also delicious. I took a bite and burned my tongue, which is my own fault for being impatient (or is it the sandwich shop's fault for making such great food? ... No, it's clearly my bad).

The service is also really gracious. Guy at the front counter (I think he is also one of the chefs) was happy to tell us about the items and let me sample the spicy relish. It was quite good - not so spivey as \"spice full\"; I bought a jar and will use it on eggs or when I cook chicken at home.  

The place is small with not much seating so I recommend getting there early or late for whatever meal you want.  But try the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches...ordered the po boy and daily special (smoked cured ham, pineapple, guac, mustard and coriander). The ingredients were fresh and the bun was soft. The combination of ingredients worked really well together. While a little on a pricier side for a sandwich ($10/sandwich), it was worth the extra dollars. Staff were friendly and there were a 2 or 3 tables and a bar table availble for seating."}
{"text":"Just found this place recently and I absolutely love it. The smoked ham is phenomenal.

Can't wait to work my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Portion size 5/5 perfect for a sandwich craving
Price 3/5 good for the size and quality but still seems pricey for just a sandwich.
Flavor 2.5/5 not as good as they look. The prosciutto was pretty boring and the crispy chicken wasn't worth $10. I also think it might be dark meat and not breast.
Something missing maybe sauce or spice.
I'd rather buy that from Popeye's for half the price. I really just wanted pastrami but they were sold out.
Another person said this about the place but it fits perfectly. \"Meh\"."}
{"text":"First off this place have become my fav, blasting upbeat tunes, people coming in and out.....staff are super friendly and always willing to let you in on the process they use to create their goods. Being a vegan dating a non-vegan im always on the search for great places that cater to both of us. Their veggie sandwich always delivers, being tasty and fresh with charred eggplant, sautéed rapini and other goodness but I have to rave about their new vegan creation. You can tell these boys are more then cooks their skilled magicians creating some of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted. Crispy braised fennel battered with a (vegan egg or seaweed extract) charred tomato slices, in house made vegan cashew cheese(so creamy, with a little tang) topped with fresh arugula and a smear of sun dried tomato pesto. Its so well balanced as I slowly eat it to saver every bite I dread that it has to end. Its amazing to see the these young chefs using their culinary genius to invent fun, healthy, delicious and unique treats! Its easy to smoke brisket and make burgers which they also exceed at here, creating tasty vegan food is a challenge and im glad they were up for it! Even if your a meat eater do yourself a favor and try a vegan sammie from Brock you wont be disappointed and its something new!!! Happy eating"}
{"text":"Fries were good. Bought a Po'boy (seafood) which I found disgusting. Too much sauce not enough seafood. Super expensive ($15) for a sandwich and fries.  

Will never return."}
{"text":"Big fan of these sandwiches, living just up the street from this place has been delicious and convenient.  No matter what you feel like chances are they'll have it.  Fried chicken, po boy, porchetta, veggie options.  They keep it simple and fresh.  Would recommend to anyone who just wants a good sandwich.
Small location so chances are you'll be eating take out!"}
{"text":"I often stop in with my Mom to share a delicious dish of poutine. It's the best poutine in the city. May you rise from the ashes."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are absolutely amazing. I am a person that believes in making food at home, I don't really like going out and buying a sandwich because I feel like I can make something similar or better at home...but Brock sandwiches makes me forget all of those beliefs. 
These sandwiches are so fucking good that I'm having trouble thinking of a way to tell you how they are so great.
First I had the fish sandwich. It had a HONKING piece of swordfish (one of the most expensive fishies out there) and came to $13. It was amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly, it had crispy, fresh arugula and house-made guacamole. So delicious.
Then I got the breakfast sandwich, basically a glamourized BLT with egg.. and definitely the most gluttonous thing on the menu. Drippy eggs, perfectly fried bacon, tomato, lettuce, and house made sauce, it was so amazing.  
The I had the veggie sandwich...the eggplant was a bit on the salty side but they were PACKED and maybe he pinched a bit too much into my sandwich because my Mum's wasn't nearly as salty... 

BUT ANYWAYS, this place fucking rules and the boy down below who is complaining about the price is just being cheap. Maybe you could buy 3 subs at subway while you could only buy 2 sandwiches at Brock but you will get 1000x the quality of any other mediocre sandwich shop. 

try it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the Yelp reviews. 

Don't get me wrong, the service is impeccable. The place is spotless and I LOVE how nice they are. They're really good, passionate guys.

..but either my tastebuds are shot and/or Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket is not for me, or ... no, it must be that people have not had good sandwiches before or general sandwich standards are very low.

I got the Turkey Club sandwich, Pulled Pork, and Beef Brisket (yes, I tried all the ones recommended by others). I avoided the Seafood PoBoy because I don't like deep fried seafood. It's a travesty to deep fry something that is already inherently so tasty with just a pinch of salt, and lightly steamed.

You should only deep fry stuff like chicken breast when it's dry, so that no one notices how awful it tastes.

Anyway, here are my reviews:

Pulled Pork / Beef Brisket: Sorry, but Beef Brisket doesn't measure up to Montreal's standards... Both sandwiches were just bland, and the bread choice was too soft. I don't like bread that is so soft that it turns soggy if you don't eat it within 5 seconds.

I found the BBQ sauce perfectly fine (not too sweet), but there's something about Pulled Pork that makes me want to vomit when I eat it, so I think I'll avoid this sandwich in the future.

Beef Brisket on the other hand, I was expecting to be tasty and delicious and it was not. The overcooked, slimy red peppers and onions didn't add to the experience and I was missing some major CRUNCH in there, like a pickle or herbs like cilantro or....... I dunno, something that would have given this bland sandwich some flavour. Maybe some melted cheese would have helped.

All I tasted was the texture of meat, this super soft icky Subway-style bun and the BBQ sauce which was thankfully not too sweet but really not the point of eating a sandwich. You could have put tempeh tofu in there and it would have tasted the same.

Turkey Club: Everything was fantastic on this sandwich EXCEPT THE TURKEY. 

LOVED the bacon. LOVED the guacamole. LOVED IT ALL even the crispy toasted bread. Perfect balance..... that was totally ruined by the turkey.

The turkey was dry and mealy. SO dry and mealy that at one point, I wondered if they had put lean ground beef in here, until I inspected the sandwich closely and realized what I thought was lean ground beef was actually the super dry, white, mealy turkey. 

In the end, the best sandwich is the Turkey Club.

So ask for the Turkey Club, but hold the turkey.

I WILL go back here, but only to try it one more time before giving up."}
{"text":"Visited Brock Sandwich today and ordered the Crispy Chicken sandwich.   The guy who rang me in (the owner I assume - or one of the owners) was pleasant.  He took my order and name and told me the sandwich would be ready in about 6-7 minutes.  While waiting for my food, I noticed these guys really work.  When not busy preparing menu items, they are milling about conversing with customers, getting feedback re: their food and cleaning up after customers etc.   I witnessed the guy who took my order wipe down eating surfaces 3 times in the short time i was there.  Nice to see.  My mom's rule of thumb when she is not familiar with a restaurant is to check out their front windows.  If they are dirty, there is a good chance the rest of the place will be also (especially the kitchen/food prep area which customers typically don't see).  The cleanliness at Brock Sandwich (with its open kitchen) conveys a pride of ownership and puts customers minds at ease re: food handling.  I took the sandwich home (not much room to sit and eat - very small space)  and it did not disappoint.  It was thick, the chicken crispy and flavourful.  The onions were a nice touch.  Definitely filling.  Looking forward to going back to try another sandwich, maybe their soup and a friend tells me their fish and their paprika fries are really good also.  A great addition to the neighbourhood!  Laying flat out on my couch writing this review in a bit of a Brock Sandwich food coma haze - a good thing!   Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The burger and fries werr the best I've had in s long time. We also had a soup and salad that were top tier."}
{"text":"Very satisfying. Burger had the onions pressed in for a very flavourful bite each time. Seafood Po'boy was awesome although was left with a lot of bun after the seafood was over. Great, fresh cut fries. Previously tried the jack fruit sandwich which was different and interesting in a positive way."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here should've been better.  I'm almost positive.  I will have to eat on the premises next time.  Biking with sandwiches for about 15 mins before consumption was doing them no favours.  The fried chicken and calamari were more soggy than anything.  I did enjoy my beef brisket though.  I'm definitely no Hurrier, that's for sure."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.

In a previous visit to the area I had seen this place and wondered whether it would be good or not. When my wife wanted to go out for lunch in the area I thought, let's try this place out.

It's a small place, so if you are coming with a big group be prepared for take-out, but man oh man is this a great place.

They have, I think, a perfect selection of sandwiches to choose from. They also have a salad and Poutine for those not interested in sandwiches. I had the Porchetta and my wife had the cheese burger (w/ Gluten Free bun) and we were very happy we went here for lunch.

The sandwiches are just an incredible mix of flavors and they are just so easy to eat. Some think the prices are a bit too high for the product, but I disagree. Anywhere in Toronto this is the norm: $10 for a decent lunch and that's how much the sandwiches are.

I will be back. This place deserves to have people lining up outside the door on Saturdays.

That's it!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been back since last summer. I had a seasonal lobster roll last year than tasted off to me and so I stopped coming in regularly. However I was hungry and right by the restaurant today so I decided I'd give it another shot. I had the Chile Steak special. The steak was cooked well and as always they have the right amount of filling to bun ratio. Every time I have come here I've taken it home and have been delighted to not have a soggy bun by the time I get there! I think it's a tad overpriced but you pay for good quality ingredients. Overall I'd say I'm glad I have it another shot and I'd probably come back. 

In the past I've tried many sandwiches from here, the best on the menu is the chicken. Juicy and delicious chicken thigh! The seafood poboy and vegan sandwich are also really good. I'd pass on the burger and fries, or poutine which are only okay."}
{"text":"Great, helpful counter service (he will explain everything on the menu for you without any annoyance in his voice); good, appealing choices; fast wait times; and yummy end product.  Good drink selection.  All around an enjoyable experience.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Sandwich shops are a dime a dozen.  I stopped in here by chance after dropping my bike off at Sweet Pete's down the street.  Quick, friendly and tidy service.  Their chicken sandwich was at the top of the menu on the wall and is probably good, but the texas brisket special caught my eye.  I was pretty much in heaven.  This is after I chanced it by keeping it in the bag while walking for a solid 20-30 minutes on a warm summer day.  I expected soggy, especially with the onions and was pleasantly surprised at a sandwich that not only wasn't drenched in oil, but may have even tasted better.  Can't wait to go back to try another!"}
{"text":"I yelped in the area looking for a quick bite and saw this come up with good reviews. Good thing i decided to try it. Their piri piri chicken sandwich was delicious! Their fries were tasty too with a dusting of bbq easoning. My only complaint was they didnt have a straw for the drink and the tv was too loud. I will go back to try the seafood po boy."}
{"text":"Came in while in the neighborhood.  Heard good things about the chicken sandwich.  Rolled on in and ordered the sandwich.  A small place is you looking to stay.  

The sandwich was reality juicy and tender.  I enjoyed the caramelized onions.  I have 

Food 8/10
Ambience 8/10
Service 10/10

I enjoyed the sandwich.  I will say I have had better.  But in no way does it make this one terrible."}

{"text":"Finally visited this place two days ago. Ordered the Cheek and Cheese sandwich and a cream soda (it's been a while!) 

First off, guys behind the counter are SO FRIENDLY. 

Cheek and cheese - slow braised beef with provolone and some other stuff. Came out hot and fresh and all kinds of delicious. The kind of sandwich where you take a bite and need a moment of silence. :) 

Awesome ambiance - menu on the wall in scrabble tiles. Food gets served on a galvanized metal tray (don't worry, it's light) and your food is on top of wax paper to contain the mess (you'll be glad!) 

Only complaint is that I wish there was more seating but it's a small space. Hopefully they get some outdoor seating set up once it gets warm. 

Sandwich was quite large and filling and came in around $8 (if I remember correctly)."}
{"text":"This place is simply outstanding. It's obvious that these guys know what they are doing with their sandwiches and great side dishes as well. I have been here several times and everything on the menu has been top notch. The buttermilk chicken is tender, crunchy and the piri piri sauce adds great flavour to it. I've also had the beef cheek sandwich, pulled pork, beef brisket, cheeseburger and all of them were excellent. Also, the fries and olives are great, I love how they use paprika on the fries! This place and Porchetta and Co are my two favourite sandwich shops in the city. I've always said that Porchetta and Co is the best sandwich place in the city but I am starting to think that these guys are gaining on them. I just wish this place was closer to where I live but I will gladly make the drive to enjoy their delicious sandwiches! If you haven't been here make the trip and try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a sandwich but everyone needs to know that the beet salad is so perfectly delicious! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Also the service was amazing. So friendly and helpful! I loved everything about my experience there today and will definitely be back regularly. Next time I am coming for the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the fried chicken sandwich. Everything else looks great but I have yet to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Great addition to the area! The sandwiches here are amazing. I highly recommend the crispy chicken sandwich or the seafood po boy. Customer service here is tops. Whenever I'm getting a haircut at my barber next door the man behind the counter is nice enough to voluntarily come deliver my order to me when it's ready. They go the extra mile!"}
{"text":"I love supporting businesses in my neighborhood and heard so many great reviews. I reeeeaaally wanted to like this place. Unfortunately I was extremely put off/shocked by the incredibly rude service at this establishment. 

Being that I live close to the shop, I decided to place my order over the phone about an hour before closing. The person that picked up sounded a little short over the phone but I just figured it was because the place might have been busy. I ordered a piri-piri chicken sandwich with fries. 

When I came into the shop the guy behind the counter ignored me as I stood there for over 5 minutes (I was the ONLY customer in the shop at this time). When I finally greeted him and said that I was there to pick up my order, he BARELY looked up at me, grabbed my completed order and plugged it into the cash register. I paid for my order, said thanks and left. Zero communication, eye contact from server. Very strange.

Two stars, one for the nicely lit and cute sandwich spot, the second for the tasty fries. The sandwich was nothing to write home about, the charred onions were a little too \"charred\" and  an absolute attack on my taste-buds.

Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Cute place with amazing sandwiches!! I think it's more of a grab and go place, as it has quite limited seating (probably seats 8). I stayed to eat my sandwich and enjoyed the ambiance there. Guys behind the counter were really friendly too.

On to the sandwiches. Tried both the chicken piri piri and the seafood po boy (split halvsies with my friend). Hands down the chicken piri piri was the winner! The chicken was juicy and tender, and the flavour combination fantastic. I wouldn't have minded more spice/kick to the sandwich though. Pretty substantial in size as well! As for the seafood po boy, it was good too but was outshone by the chicken sandwich. It was less food in comparison, and I usually love cilantro, but found it the cilantro here to be too much.

Would be back! Their vegan options look delicious...mmm."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! 

There's heart to every sandwich being made there. I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the sandwiches. 
Me and my boyfriend shared The buttermilk chicken sandwich, as it was 3pm and we didn't want to get full - it left us wanting more! 
The Chicken was tender and the batter was VERY crispy. The piri piri sauce was spot on and the caramelized onion was so deliciously tying everything together. We sat in a bench outside the shop and chowed down the burger on a Saturday afternoon and people were eyeing our burgers with jealousy! 

It's so good that i will come out of the way to get it again and again and this time I don't think we will share. Sorry, boyfriend.

Note: there's a bit of a wait and not much seats, guess they are still working out the kinks but it's sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like bread toasted almost to the point of being burnt AND so soggy the sandwich doesn't hold its shape, this is the place for you.  They put a lot of meat in their sandwiches, but not much else.  And the meat is dry.  I ended up taking the sandwich apart and feeding the meat to a cat."}
{"text":"I rarely come down this area but since I was there a colleague recommend me to check this place out. No regrets whatsoever. I was greeted by very kind and happy workers behind the counter. I changed my mind three times about whether I wanted to eat in or take out and they were sweet every time. Got the seafood po boy and man it was good ! The flavours were great, the bun was crispy, it was cooked perfectly and the coriander gave it such a fresh taste ! Would totally recommend you to try it out."}
{"text":"I had the seafood po boy which was awesome. I didn't think I would like the Cole slaw and coriander on the sandwich but I ultimately loved it. My boyfriend had the cheeseburger which he said was amazing. We had the fries which were seasoned perfectly and needed no ketchup. We ordered the food to go, and the server made the fries when I came in so they'd be fresh. He was so polite. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"came here with a friend while in the area.  there was not much around the area but this was a welcoming surprise on the street.   small place but comfy and quaint.  clean and has some areas to sit.  

we shared the po'boy - lightly deep-fried shrimp and calamari with spicy slaw and fresh cilantro and the special (smoked ham, spicy pineapple, mustard, guacamole, fresh cilantro).  flavours were excellent and loved the freshness of the food.  deep-fried shrimp and calamari did not taste oily - cooked perfectly.  

would come here again if i'm ever in the neighbourhood or even when i drive along bloor i'd stop by again.  

only wish they could pack the po'boy a bit with shrimp and calamari.  next time will definitely order a side of slaw!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a sandwich one day and were so amazed at how good it was we had returned three days in a row.  The sandwiches are well thought through providing a delicious experience.

The Menu:
The pulled pork sandwich is very unique, big mouthfuls of high quality pork, tender and juicy, with only a light coating of a honey mustard bbq sauce.   
The seafood po boy was our favourite, sweet firm shrimp just barely cooked, and some tender calamari, both dusted with paprika.  Lots of fragrant cilantro, crunchy coleslaw and a beautiful sweet pepper relish added in light amounts, drizzled with avocado sauce.
The prosciutto sandwich had fresh creamy buffalo cheese, arugla, roasted sweet peppers and drizzled with olive oil.  This pairs beautifully with their lemongrass soda.
In each instance the bread for the sandwiches is paired nicely, the texture holding up to the contents without overwhelming the flavour of the fillings.
Fries: We must admit we are not fans of the fries as a matter of personal taste. They're cooked well and a good quality of potato is used, but they are heavily seasoned and too salty for our palates.

The Spot:
It's located on Bloor street amongst a bunch of other little shops and coffee shops. Like all the food options in this area, expect very limited seating.  There are two small tables and then a counter with a few seats.   Take out is a good option, or eat there and make room for someone else to sit down - definitely not a  place you can politely linger while chatting away with friends unless it's during their slower hours.

The Service:
Everything is made fresh to order so if you show up too soon after opening some things may not be ready - like sauces for the po boy for example. They are always eager to provide sincere and thoughtful suggestions and seem to be really invested in people taking pleasure in their food.   The staff is always friendly, and food usually takes about 10 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Everyone loved their sandwiches today!

We ordered a lil bit of everything. The Brisket, the Fennel, Shrimp & Squid Po boy, and the chicken piri piri and a few of the beet salads that were very fresh and delish. They were super nice and patient on the phone when I called to order. 

The chicken was amazing but it can get soggy fast! I wish it were a bit spicier but it was delish! The Fennel was called 'the best sandwich I ever ate' so they don't half ass their vegan sandwiches! 

A+ establishment."}
{"text":"the bad news is, Brock Sandwich aint cheap. However, if you should choose to indulge, try the chicken sandwich (it's tasty and the least expensive) and for the love of god, try the truffle poutine.  The truffle poutine will make you and anyone around you begin to twerk.  The chef will twerk and so will his minions.  At first I was like,\"what the H-E double hockey sticks are truffles?\" and the guy was like, \"smell this.\"  He passed me this greenish oil bottle and I was in. The gravy is so thick and there are just enough cheese curds.  If you should happen to feel aroused after consuming this meal, know that there is a gentleman's club outside of Brock Sandwich, and there's another one up the street, right beside the church. You heard me.  Haven't tried much of anything else, but I look forward to a day when my finances allow me to try the brisket. I can give no less than 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I moved into the neighbourhood a couple of months ago and have visited Brock sandwich a few times, each time being a pleasure. 

My boyfriend's a big fan of the brisket and I alternate between their two vegan options(fennel, and the new jackfruit) which are both seriously satisfying. The guys are always friendly and accommodating and I'm always surprised how fast my food is ready. 

5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good sandwiches. Everything tastes fresh and made with love.  Every time I've been there, I've had great service and left with a satisfied belly."}
{"text":"Most amazing burger I've ever had!!! Everything on their menu is delicious. Ingredients are super fresh, and meals are creative and mouth watering. Definitely be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Brock Sandwich is scrumptious! What a find ! 

These guys DO SANDWICHES RIGHt!  

The food is beautiful visually and delightful to eat but not overwhelming. They don't go over the top their assembly of flavours dance in your mouth - the result is wonderful. Intimate, low key atmosphere and everyone there brings their wealth of experience from working in the best restaurants in Toronto; a humble bunch of guys, who are sincerely flattered and appreciative of seeing the smiles on their customers faces...you can tell they love the experience of food and it show in every bite :)

We have tried the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich ( I believer their best seller ), the Daily Seared Fish Sandwich (my personal favorite) , a very distinguished Brock Cheese Burger and a new addition to their menu; a mouth watering truffled glazed poutine   - melted in my mouth - just wonderful ! 

Cant wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing. Their vegan fennel sandwich is so good, I was heartbroken when I saw the fennel got replaced by zucchini, though I guess that's how you keep the menu fresh and interesting. Gave the zucchini a try but it wasn't the same. Hopefully the fennel will come back, please, please bring it back! The jackfruit sandwich is also very tasty. Watch for their daily specials, they are awesome. I've had the soft shell crab one and the cauliflower one, both super great. Thank god for a place that really understands the art of the sandwich. The ambiance is nice too, really chill, service is really friendly, and orders come promptly."}
{"text":"I came there for their vegan BBQ sandwich which made of jack fruits. It was amazing. The taste of jack fruits was really like meat especially adding their flavourful bbq sauce. The sandwich was juicy and in a good portion. I almost ate it all at lunch time because I spent some time riding bicycle from downtown to there. I found that some yelpers also recommended pulled pork and cheese burger. I want to come back and try them asap but the place was just a little far away from my home."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend now and it has become a ritual. It is still as delicious as ever and they've increased their selection. Tried the breakfast peameal sandwich, brisket, and porcetta - all really good. The few times I've ordered the fish I didn't like as much. Their pirpiri chicken is still our fav."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing. They have a few core sandwiches they always make, and then a few specials that change with some frequency. If you haven't been before get the Piri Piri Chicken. It's probably the best thing on the menu? The place is very small. It's probably best for take out, but there is a bit of room to dine in if you are in a pinch."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me when I complained about the lack of take-out options in my neighbourhood. This is definitely a welcomed food option in Brockton Village.

The sandwiches are pretty heavy-duty. I got the chicken something-or-other the first time I ate here and it was pretty damn delicious, and quite filling. We also split some fries, but I didn't really care for them. They were quite dry and sort of tasted like Shake & Bake sprinkled on potatoes. The last time I ate here I grabbed the breakfast sandwich, and felt like I was going to have a heart-attack while eating it (in a good way). Probably not good for my ticker, but was great for my tummy. Also got a salad, which seemed visually bland, but was very tasty.

The place is expensive. $10 for a sandwich seems like a lot to me, but I guess you're getting some good quality eats. It's not something I can afford to eat on a regular basis but I've certainly been back a few times. I hope they expand their menu a little more though -- only about a half dozen sandwich options at the moment."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but unfortunately the service was subpar. I went on a weekday for lunch and waited over 30mins for a sandwich & fries. Seeing as it was a smoked brisket sandwich (meaning the meat was pre-cooked) I don't understand the wait. To make matters worse I saw people come in & order after me get served first (same orders). When I questioned this I was given a ridiculous answer that they can't make more than one sandwich at a time. That still never answers why I was served a good 5-10 mins after others I ordered before. 

I would only go back if I was in no hurry, but if you're on a lunch break at work beware."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwhich.. it was so gigantic but so good I couldn't help but finish it all. The clogged arteries are well worth it."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here during the big on bloor festival.I had the vegan bbq jackfruit sandwich with fries and it was delish! 
The service was fast and very friendly. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"A gem of a place. I thoroughly enjoyed my schnitzel sandwich this afternoon. The dill sauce and the sautéed greens were an added bonus. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing sandwich ! 
I was a little sticker shocked. It's not often that I'll pay $11 for a sandwich. But I went on a recommendation... And now I want to recommend this FIST of old fashioned GOODNESS to everyone I know! 
Delicious!!!! 
Coming back for lunch tomorrow!
Ps. Cappuccino was perfect also."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and I remember enjoying Brock Sandwich's food months before, so I gave 'em a call and asked what their specials were. The extremely helpful guy on the phone told me Chili Steak and Pulled Pork and that was all I needed to hear.

I took one bite out of the Chili Steak and immediately proclaimed it one of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten. Honestly, it was perfect. The bread was soft yet sturdy, the steak was tender and delicious, and the sauce in there was absolutely delectable. (I think it was a combination of guacamole, tomatillo, and cilantro, plus other things? I'm not sure, but it was perfection.)

The Pulled Pork didn't fare quite as well, sadly. It's possible that it was completely overshadowed by the gloriousness that was the Chili Steak. The meat wasn't especially tender and the sauce(s) in there were far from memorable.

Nevertheless, I have to give Brock Sandwich five stars for that Steak sandwich. Oh my god, I want to eat that all day every day for the rest of my friggin' life."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place. The owner Matt is super nice, the daily specials are DEELISH (as is the regular menu), and because it's small you can sill hear what your lunch date is saying. Don't plan to stay too long though during peak hours, as seating is limited."}
{"text":"The chicken was just out of the fryer and it was so tender and juicy.   The sauce gave it just the right amount of spice but definitely not hot at all."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in my neighbourhood. I've tried almost every sandwich on the menu by now, and they're all very good. Keep an eye out for their specials: my favourite sandwich I've had there so far is their lobster roll which I've only seen on the menu once. 

Bonus to the extremely friendly and accommodating staff. They seem genuinely interested in your experience, and are also just an all-around good addition to the neighbourhood. They are interested in what you have to say, and tell you about the going-ons in the area. I love places like this that add to the community. 

If you're looking for some tasty, quick takeout along Bloor West, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Best calamari that almost had a pork belly consistency. The po' boy was amazing: the bun was perfectly toasted, the tomatillo inspired and the shrimp was so juicy and well seasoned. The mother in law shared a bite of her crispy chicken which blew my mind and the hubby shared his prosciutto sandwich that was simple and delicious. Will be making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about this place that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, but I felt compelled to leave a review anyway because I love this place so much. 

The seafood po'boy is my one of my go-to takeout meals in the city. It's jammed full of goodness and the bun they serve it on is always fresh and delicious. I've tried a few of the other menu items (prosciutto, meatball sub) and they are all fantastic. In addition to making awesome sandwiches, the staff are all exceptionally friendly.

If you haven't been here yet - get to it!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, talk about finger licking good. I'm currently eating their smoked ham sandwich, with guacamole and pineapple and bbq sauce and salsa. I had to stop and write this. I have always been impressed with this place, and today they blew me away. I had an awesome latte, fresh water, and now this sandwich. It is messy. In my personal opinion, that is the only way a sandwich should be. I am so excited this place is just around the corner from me. Thank you Brock!"}
{"text":"Big ass sandwich.

That pretty much sums up what this place can offer you. They have a pretty small but good selection of options. If you come here, make sure you have a good appetite - otherwise you could easily share these sandwiches - that's how big they are.

The spot is small and has a couple of tables and stools, so mainly this indicates the place mostly caters to take-out orders. The owners are super friendly and chatty and will gladly tell you about their specials and how they prepare the food.

I have tried a few of their sandwiches, my favourite is still the Crispy Buttermilk Chicken sandwich (with Piri Piri sauce - OMG!); however, I cant say I haven't liked any of the other sandwiches I have tried there. Most of the ingredients are made in house, which makes this little joint so special. Also try their Yukon potato frites - spiced w paprika, salt - so perfectly crispy. 

It's exactly what this area needed, a little sandwich spot that makes sandwiches right, that I just would not be able to make myself at home. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and price. Two thumbs up guys!! Had the crispy chicken sandwich and would definitely come back to try more. You can tell the owner knows and loves his sammies! Decent prices and everything seems fresh made."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!  I've been to Black Camel a few times, but I like this place better.  I had the prosciutto and my wife the piri piri chicken, both were delicious.  Not many places to get a great sandwich in Toronto, but this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"The best club ever.  Homemade guacamole, no mayo crap, real turkey, quality fresh bread.  Service impeccable.  Place was packed for lunch and now I know why.   I lived in the area for 12 years and it's the best thing to happen for sandwiches here ever. Thank you for opening such a gem of a place."}
{"text":"I called in at lunch, and my order was ready when I arrived. 

Everything was fresh, the chicken sandwich was moist inside, but the coating was arguably a little over-crisped on the corners.

I like what they're thinking with the flavours here, but it doesn't suit my tastes. I find the onions too...i don't know, sour? It's not for me. It's not bad, it's just like some other have said not everyone loves it. The bun was soft. 

I didn't like the fries. Again, i like the idea, but both times I've had their fries they weren't crisp. I don't know what oil they're frying in, or if the temp is too low, but another let down for me. Not bad, just not great. 

Worth a shot, and, I'll be back - it's just not a place that I'll be craving for weeks to come."}
{"text":"Have you ever called a restaurant to place an order and had a telephonic heart to heart about the best sandwich shops in New York over the phone?!  The fact that this conversation took place, and the enthusiasm on the other end are enough reason for me to love Brock. 

Fortunately, that's not where the good news stops. Brock really does make some of the best, most well balanced sandwiches in our city. They're not necessarily the biggest, cheapest or most unique but they really hit the spot and will have you thinking \"wow, that was really good!\". 

Piri Piri chicken might be the best chicken sandwich in Toronto. I always want to try the other items, but this item is more than enough to keep me coming back. Other notable mentions are the solid burger and the steak sandwich when it's on the menu (even better when it's with chimichurri sauce).

Overall, this is as good as a sandwich gets in Toronto. Kudos to everyone involved."}
{"text":"Small shop with great sandwiches! The fries are fresh and sprinkled with paprika which is an interesting twist on fries. We tried the all day breakfast sandwich (which can be made vegetarian) and the chicken piri piri, both delicious. The owner (we think) was super friendly and on it."}
{"text":"if you like good sandwiches you'll hate this place. who puts cilantro on a steak sandwich? did you aunt die and bequeath you a whole bunch of cilantro? NEXT!"}
{"text":"Brock Sandwich is a tiny sandwich shop on Bloor West with a cozy vibe and atmosphere. The staff here demonstrate a passion for making delicious, satisfying sammies. For roughly $10, you can try pretty much any of their menu offerings, which includes breakfast items and a truffle poutine (which I'll be ordering next time I visit).

The sandwich lineup sticks to traditional, classic options in terms of ingredients and toppings. You'll have no problem finding something to try out, as they offer everything from burgers to a vegan-friendly BBQ jackfruit sandwich (which is making noise in the blog world at the moment).

It's not all that spacious of a shop but doesn't feel cramped or uncomfortable. The staff are friendly and upbeat from my experience. They've got breakfast sandwiches and side dishes like poutine and fries, making them a well-rounded option for any meal when you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Another must try, the Fennel sandwich. Yes you heard me right... No meat! The fennel is juicy and lightly battered and fried. It's topped with a delicious homemade tomato sauce and 'ricotta cheese' (which is actually made from cashews to make this a completely vegan sandwich). I normally don't order veg when there are meat options but I absolutely love this sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighbourhood for years and when I'm looking for a treat, Brock Sandwich is the best of the neighbourhood. When I first went, I thought the owner was slightly surly, but then one time my dad and I were eating there and someone was served the wrong sandwich, so the owner asked if we wanted it and i realized he has a heart of gold, and it comes through in the sandwiches (and fries!!) The pulled Jackfruit is so flavourful, and only slightly better veggie option to the fennel.  

Also, the burger and fries are the best I can remember ever having. Where is there a better burger? Tell me! you probably can't."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were a non event, not exciting fall back...until Brock Sandwich opened. I get giddy thinking about their sandwiches. Most ingredients are made in house and done damn diggity well!! Flavourgasms are to be expected. Be forewarned, all other sandwiches will be ruined for you forever after. Try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Open since 2013, I was surprise that Brock Sandwich (@BrockSandwich) was never on my \"list\" before, I only decided to go when I saw a picture of their sandwich on Instagram a few weeks ago.

The place is rather small, more of a take out counter since they have less than 10 seats.

You order at the counter, take a seat & food will be bought over when ready. Love the casual friendliness here, they checked on us twice to make sure we are enjoying our meal.

Soup of the day $6
~ We order the large size and we were immediately offer to split into 2 bowl for us.
~ This was a vegan vegetable and chic pea soups and it was so delicious that I can't believe there's not the slightest bit of meat in it.
 

Brisket Sandwich
~ This wasn't on the menu, we originally wanted to order the porchetta but we were quickly told that the brisket was just done so we switch without hesitation. ~ Love Love Love it!!!
~ It had just the right amount of fatty and it was also perfectly moist. Delicious!
~ Also love how the bun hold up to all the meat and the saucy caramelized onions.
 



Vegan BBQ Smoked Jack Fruit Sandwich $10
~ Pulled Jack Fruit with Vegan Coleslaw, BBQ Sauce
~ OMG!!! Still can't believe it's not meat. When it first came, I almost thought they gave us the wrong order, definitely look like pulled pork to me.
~ Only at my second bite that I felt/tasted the difference in the texture and taste.
~ I feel like the BBQ sauce help in the illusion and the secrets was the canned green jackfruit that they get from Asian groceries.


Verdict:
~ Love 
~ Affordable and Friendly
~ Will have to come back to try their other sandwich especially the Fried Chicken and the burger."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this stop on our quest for Toronto's best fried chicken sandwich. The truffle fries were fantastic. The staff super nice. Unfortunately the sandwich was a bit over cooked. Still you could do worse in the area and the other sandwiches looked great. I would come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Decided to head to Brock Sandwich since i was in the area. Came by on a weekday around 1pm and the place was still busy as ever! Just so happen there were no seats available for me to sit so I decided to get my sandwich to go. The seating is quite limited....around 8-9 spots only (2 tables and 4 individual seats). While waiting for my sandwich someone left and I decided to sit in and eat my sandwich. Staff are friendly and they brought my sandwich and some water to me instead of asking me to go up to get it myself from the counter. 

I got the crispy chicken piri piri sandwich. Although it states that the sandwich is supposed to be spicy, it was barely spicy for me. The chicken itself was very crispy! Messy to eat but is very delicious and will fill you up. I was tempted to try the seafood po'boy or the prosciutto baguette but that will have to wait till another day."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Shrimp po boy is my go-to option. Owner is a no-nonsense super friendly dude."}
