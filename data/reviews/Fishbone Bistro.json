{"text":"We had an excellent meal. The pork chop was perfectly cooked and the creme brulé for dessert was delicious.  The only concern was that they could use more wait staff. Although attentive and polite, our waiter was overworked and service was somewhat slow."}
{"text":"Nice surprise in \"downtown\" area in Stouffville. Small place, but excellent food and really attentive service."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in stouffville and you're extremely hungry and everything else is closed including the local variety store for a bag of chips this would be your best bet otherwise avoid it at all costs. The first thing that hits you is the odd service waiters and waitresses seem to walk by you like you don't exist will spend more time talking to everyone else which should include you but for some reason doesn't. The one selection is not a selection at all very limited seller is what you'll have to deal with. You will find a restaurant extremely busy but they're all locals who have no clue what you eating out is like at higher and restaurants. Overall extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good ! I have worked  in Toronto for the past 25  years. I have eaten at every top rated restaurant in the city. I ate at fish bone tonight and it was excellent ! This compares  to the best Portuguese I have eaten (chiados) etc . I have seen this before in (905) , the town won't pay for good food . Very unfortunate . People you have to support restaurants you enjoy .  To the owner , Ryan is the best waiter  you have going , don't forget about him ."}
{"text":"While one would think this is a seafood only restaurant it's not.  It's a small little bistro with a Portuguese flare.  The menu is small, which is what a bistro should have.  The food was fresh and we enjoyed everything we ate.  The dinner experience reminded me of Europe where you were not rushed to get out.  The servers let you enjoy your meal and company without bothering you like most larger chains.  Great for a date.  The owner also came by to check on us to ensure we enjoyed our meal. The price is a little high, but worth it.  Presentation, atmosphere, and taste were all great. Worth Checking out."}
{"text":"Add this one to your must-try list - it's restored my faith in Markham/Stouffville restaurants. They are only open for dinner service from 5-9pm and it is quite small (maybe 40-50 max. capacity), but in no way do you feel rushed to give way to the next group. The interior is cozy, clean and modern looking without trying too hard; service was efficient, friendly and non-invasive considering the tight squeeze between tables and other servers milling about.   We (4) each unintentionally had a different app, main and dessert, and absolutely everything was spot on. I started with the beet salad with goat cheese and frisée lettuce, which was a nice light start; main was buttery arctic char (with delicious crispy skin) over red/wild rice with enoki mushrooms, baby spinach and some sort of tasty sauce swept around the plate. Dessert was Baileys crème brûlée - I couldn't really taste the Baileys but I didn't care because it was awesome. The menu is partially seasonal and isn't extensive, but there's no need when everything is this good.   Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant has taken the location of what was once known as Main Street Bistro.   The interior of the restaurant has received an update; its much more contemporary now, but it's still a small restaurant. I will admit, it's a nice ambiance.  The menu is pretty small, but what they do, I think they do ok. We had the chorizo sausage to start. It was a nice presentation of one hefty sausage that was flaming while at the table. Pretty cool presentation. I had the fillet of something. It was tasty, but as you can tell, not that memorable. My dinner partner had the whole fish. I must say, it's pretty remarkable to see a whole grilled fish on a plate. However, while the server said it was a bass, when it was present to us, we didn't think that it looked like a bass. It too was tasty, the fish was moist and piping hot. But the potatoes served with it seemed pre-made and sad as a side dish. They were perfectly melon-ball sized...maybe a little too perfect to be made fresh?  We went on a Friday night the restaurant was relatively full all night, with only 1 or 2 tables empty that I saw. So while a good thing that it was busy, the service was as slow as molasses. There was 1 server who was quite nice, however pretty disorganized. It could be due to a lack of experience? There was 1 busboy who didn't seem to know how to set a table and then the bartender/jack-of-all trades who ran the front shop. The restaurant isn't big and you'd be hard pressed to not catch someone's eye if you needed anything, but for some reason, it was tough. We didn't just want to call across the restaurant for the bill so we waited for a cool 20 min after our dessert plates were cleared before anyone came to check if we needed anything else or wanted the bill.  While the food was good, portion sizes just right, yet I feel the prices were expensive, and the service was way slow."}
{"text":"my husband and i went here the first week they were open. we are a young couple.  we stood in the front door with three people behind the bar looking at us. the restaurant was empty. once one of the three had seated us we were asked what we wanted to drink. i just wanted water-the server said they had tap water or carbonated water. stouffville's water is next to pickering's water its just gross you don't drink the tap water. so i asked what beer they had. the server told me the name of a greek beer. i dont like heavy beers so i asked if it was a pilsner. it must have confused him because he just repeated the name of the beer. the whole time the other two behind the bar are talking about us, smirking and staring. my husband asked for a moment and the server left. another couple walked in dressed well. the server was right on them assisting them to their seat handing out compliments to the older couple, telling them about their fresh fish and nice things on the menu. we never got that. i love fish i want to hear about the menu.  we stood up and were laughing aloud as we walked through the front door to leave. never even had a chance to try the fresh fish. i've never gone back. i don't see the point in paying someone money to be treated like i don't belong"}
{"text":"Great little place in Stouffville for seafood.   My hubby and I started the grilled calamari  and crab cakes.   Calamari was good as per other reviewers,  but the crab cakes were even better since it's not heavily battered and really well seasoned.       The mains we both had fish,  he got the grilled whole fish which was slightly dry and parts were a little fishy but well seasoned, while I had another grilled fish which was nice but not that memorable.     Overall given the quality of food, price, service and the fact that we don't have to drive all the way downtown,  we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a dinner with family Great please and very tasty food! Beautiful presentation of the food :) Loved it"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food and service has always been great. We have had the same waiter (maybe the owner?) twice who is very knowledgable about the menu and can make a great recommendation."}
{"text":"Fishbone is such an amazing addition to Main Street stouffville . The food and service is always wonderful , love going there for date nights"}
{"text":"Last night we celebrated my 64th birthday at fishbone stouffville. We had heard so much about it that was good although expensive. We all ordered something different. All 4 meals were salty and app portions small. Cesare salad dry with pork belly cubes that were awful. The fried Brussels sprouts we crunchy and sweet different but not in a good way. My flat steak was sliced into 5 finger size portions but  very small on top of onions and diced potatoes all salty and the steak was not tender for $28 .  The osso Bucco was dry and what it came with salty. The beef cheeks if u could find them among the pasta and soupy broth were ok but broth very salty. The pork chop was OK but some type of slaw that was on top was very salty. The only really good thing was the foccacia bread and olive spread unfortunately  for 4 adults and 1 child we were given a portion the size of 1 slice of white bread cut into 5 strips not even the equivalent of a roll each. The glass of wine just one was in a large glass and only filled the bottom 2 inches.  We told the server everything was salty she asked if we wanted it redone we said no as I'm leary about sending food back. ......just in case it would come back with a surprise ingredient so we ate what we could as we were hungry and after a bill of over $200 we left.  What a waste what a disappointment"}
{"text":"My husband heard about this place and was dying to try it. He's not too crazy about driving downtown for dinner so this place was perfect! We were very impressed with the food, ambience, service and price. From start to finish, the food was amazing! You honestly get downtown quality food for small town prices. I can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've now been to the restaurant on Main St., the Musselman Lake location and used them for catering my too old to mention birthday party. The service is simply outstanding and the food is extremely good. The Main St. location has a an excellent style Portuguese menu albeit short with a European style decor and service staff. The service staff here might be a bit stiff around the collar but helpful and knowledgeable. The lake location is my favorite although only there in the summer. Great patio only with outstanding service. The catering side is the 5 star portion with sky is the limit options and over the top staff."}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law introduced us to this place. We really enjoyed it. I had the chorzio sausage which came in a flaming pig dish (A+ for presentation - a signature item) and the seafood stew which was excellent. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Stouffville. The owner is hands on and often personally caters to his guests needs.  Intimate setting, nice patio. parking on the street or behind the restaurant. Prices are reasonable and the service is excellent.  Nice to get a 5 star meal at a local restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a few times, and brought ur family as well! The ambiance is comfy and elegant with good service.  My favorite thing to eat thus far are the scallops.  They're perfectly cooked, buttery and melt in your mouth goodness!"}
{"text":"I dont really write review but Fishbone deserves my 5 star. Amazing food, and server was super nice! Came on a thurs evening, quiet neighborhood and we just parked on the street. appetizers we got fried goat cheese, honey glazed on top with walnut and apple slices- the best i ever had!! Lucky lime oysters are really fresh!  Mains we had the crab linguine, really love the sauce!  Desserts- poached pear & creme brulee! Lovely lovely dinner!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here - very creative and a nice local feel. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Charming and small. Great service. Interesting menu. Huge wine list.   Definitely an occasion restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! Foodies don't have to travel far to find good food. We had the calamari and crab cake apps - Excellent - I'd order them again! We had the sea scallops and burger mains - again excellent - we loved our meals and would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The burger and fries are amazing! Ask for a side of the lemon chili oil for dipping the fries. The calamari appetizer is fantastic and the scallops on risotto are perfect. A great find in the small community of Stouffville."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and nice venue.   Food was ok...like a 6/10.  Had the scallops in risotto.  Way too salty.  Wife had a pasta that she did not like.  Apps were good.   Service was terrible.  The girls serving us were totally off.  Slow and generally not the nicest.  i.e., went there with a group (with kids)...ordered lots of food and drinks.  Asked for bread refill for kids and they said the first plate is free.  Really???  $800 bill and charging me $2 for bread?   Stupid to be honest.  Will not return on principle."}
{"text":"I was completely surprised  by this gem in Stouffville... and while we had the benefit of the owner (Pedro) taking care of us, I think our experience would have been just as good with any of his other serving staff.  Food was terrific- starter beet salad with goat cheese and arugula, was a highlight.  Mixed seafood grill (calamari, shrimp and octopus), all very good as well.  Portuguese-only wine list had some hits, but were generally pricey.  Agree with an earlier review I read regarding the bright(er) lighting throughout, dimmer bulbs would enhance the experience.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited the Musselman's Lake location of Fishbone (155 Cedarvale Blvd) this summer and had a really nice experience. The restaurant is open-air, on a patio overlooking the lake. It makes you feel like you are at the cottage...so peaceful on a gorgeous summer evening! Service was timely, the menu list short but adequate...and the food more than what we expected. We had the flavourful Brussels sprouts appetizer, crab meat burger, fries and a pasta with chicken, mushrooms and pesto. All items were nicely prepared. The drink list again was not extensive, but adequate for the menu presented. The faint smell of smoke from the wood-fired pizza oven completed the wonderful ambiance. I enjoyed myself so much that I plan to return before the warm weather disappears!"}
{"text":"I had a friend recommend me this restaurant and since we live in Markham the drive wasn't too far. We were pleasantly surprised! We enjoyed 3 appetizers and 2 entrees and everything tasted great! I particularly liked the scalloped on beet risotto. We will definitely come back and would love to try the restaurant by the lake!  The price wasn't bad too!"}
{"text":"food: its not AMAZING but it's good. The chorizo is a bit hard and the seafood soup was just not enough seafood, more potatoes than anything. but overall the food was flavorful. My husband had the Flat iron steak and that was pretty good. Presentation was a good too.   few complaints and hopefully used as constructive feedback because this place has potential and would like to see this place hang around.   1. the place was  too bright, they need to dim the lights a notch or two. I was there on my husband and my 11th wedding anniversary and we would have liked it a bit more intimate.  2. We went around 8:30 sure we closed the place down and the evening was rather quiet..us and another couple, but 3/4 of the night my husband and I couldn't have a proper conversation due the fact that the staff were not so busy so they were able to chat at the bar about their weekend and it was rather loud and distracting. We sat by the window and we could hear their conversation all the way.   3. The wait staff should be a little bit more educated on wine and waht they have as selection....ours had no clue.   4. they brought out the mop before we left.. hmmm.. so the night was ended with the smells of cleaners not the aromas of our lovely dinner.   5. a little suggestion regarding your website if you're reading.. you gotta use another font other than times new roman and remove all the BLUE for links its rather distracting. Also your wine list online is SO hard to read. just not stylized... it looks very amateur and your website is the first impression of an establishment.     we will be back there but hoping it would be different experience for the better."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The bring your own wine feature is a very nice feature. The service is friendly but they seemed understaffed as we were left on our own for lengthy periods of time. The lamb was delicious as was the octopus. There is a great selection of appetizers"}
{"text":"Another amazing experience at Fishbone. The food was fabulous and service was absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Rude reception ! We arrived without a reservation and there were tables open. We were told it would be 10-15 mins wait I asked if he was sure as the there was a table around the corner. He's rude and sarcastic ,\"why would I tell you there was a ten minute wait if I had a table open\" We are now sitting down the street having an amazing meal at the Corner House ."}
{"text":"Chances are you will need reservations here. Great food, small intimate setting and 5 star service. Try the sea bass and for an app try the shrimp tacos. This place is all about the flavour."}
{"text":"A real treat. The sardines are excellent: boneless and moist and packed with flavour. The make their own sparkling water and so you are not stuck with paying a ton  of money to have water on the table. All in all, a real treat."}
{"text":"Ah yes, I remember the first time I came to this restaurant and ordered only the fried calamari. (The soft bread with the yellow spread that I got the first time I was at the bistro was quite light) Now, for the calamari bit. There was a piece of membrane about half an inch long but I sort of brushed it off and enjoyed the rest of the calamari dish. All in all a great restaurant with good food but with staff who look like they met a stranger on the street for the first time or encountered by a stalker. Also, it's best you do not come too early, too late, or during private reservation to this restaurant. Now, if you want a restaurant to give you a warm welcome, go with Guu Izakaya."}
{"text":"Coming here on a Tuesday to an empty restaurant.  Maybe my waiter never expect anyone to be coming in for dinner? He was sure a little confused: gave us the lunch menu instead of dinner, told us the wrong items for the prix fixe menu. Making me more confused.... but as the night went on, he did put himself together.   $25 prix  fixe menu Monday to Wednesday at Fishbone Bistro is quite decent.  Choice of : Soup/Salad, Fish/Chicken and Dessert  Mushroom Soup was tasty and have good aroma Fish perfectly pan fried  Mini banana  Doughnuts with caramel dipping on the side was the best dish of the day!   Seafood Paella ($22) though tasty the portion is really small = pricey!  Suggestion: Maybe a printout or a chalkboard that would be updated with the item selections and a more detail description of what offers. Just telling me Fish or Chicken for the main didn't help me and I felt like I am on one of the flights eating horrible food on the planes.  Fishbone Bistro is a decent Portuguese restaurant, especially up in Stouffville. Good but not amazing. If you are in the area, definitely give them a try.  5/15"}
{"text":"Nice place for a sit down dinner in Stouffville. The restaurant is small and cozy and filled up fast for a Thursday night.  I had the grilled calamari for appetizer ($13) served with hummus and cucumber tomato salad. Calamari was fresh and grilled to perfection. The olive chick pea hummus strangely compliments the calamari well. Tomatoes were fresh and delish. I would get this again.  For entree, we both had braised lamb shank served with basil mashed. The lamb was perfectly cooked. Meat was falling off the bone, and juicy. It came with a generous amount of mashed. I love basil; so needless to say I really enjoyed the basil mashed.  I didn't have room for desserts.  Overall, 4.5 for food quality, price is a bit high, 3 for service (it can be a bit more attentive), 4 for ambiance."}
{"text":"Sublimely delicious food, super friendly service from the hostess and the waitress ... but it was SOOOO slow! Seated right away, 10min wait before we got water... another 15min wait to order drinks... then another 15min air for food... and close to 30min after dinner for bill! If the service was reflective of the quality of the food and the prices... this place would be 4 or even 4.5 stars... unfortunately disappointing in that regard!"}
