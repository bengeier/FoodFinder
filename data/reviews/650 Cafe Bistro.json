{"text":"Although I have been here before for coffee, I finally had lunch here with a friend. The decor/environment is modern and creative. The staff are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. 

There was a variety of dishes for lunch, i had the spinach tilapia with roasted vegetables. It was nicely done and well seasoned. 

Excited to return in the future to try out other menu items!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The decor is really cute too. Great addition to the area. The price is exceptionally good, for the quality and preparation of the food."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly owner. 
Very good coffee and great tea selections. 

Trendy decorations and very welcoming atmosphere but sometimes the place will be full of cooking smells ( especially garlic). In that case, it's better to order your food to go."}
{"text":"Good espresso for a great price! Probably the best bang for your buck in all of downtown Toronto. The flavour is lighter than what I prefer and I wish they had more breakfast options.  Right now they have baklava, bougatsa, spinach pie and some muffins in the morning.  Lunch options are available and change daily. 

The decor of this place is gorgeous. I would decorate my house like this. Outside in front of the shop is a cute little bistro area for sitting. They are doing construction  for what I am guessing is a backyard patio."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here has been delicious! Unfortunately I don't go very often because I always want more! Specifically protein. I'm always still kinda hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Had the lamb shish kebob here. The meat was succulent and tender, but a bit flavourless, both in seasoning and in lamb flavour. However, the tzatziki sauce was delicious and I dipped enthusiastically throughout the meal. The rice was a bit dry. The salad was tasty, with the right amount of dressing and some tasty slices of strong cheese. Small slice of bread was okay.

Overall, it was just okay. The portion was too small for me - one smallish skewer, about a cup of salad, and some rice. Cost: $9.90. Not expensive, but also not filling.

The service was great! They were friendly and encouraging and lively. You order at the cashier, and then they serve you at your table (there was no option to tip while paying)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here regularly for lunch. We've worked in this area for many years and stumbled across this place a few months ago. Best lunch spot in the area. The food is always fresh and cooked right on the spot. We always get the souvlaki with salad. The tzatiki is delicious and is hands down the best part. The meat is so tender and flavourful. The salad it's loaded with fresh veggies, herbs and a huge chunk of feta. Perfect size meal for a lunch. 
The owner is also very friendly and down to earth. 
We have yet to try coffee or desserts but I imagine they are all just as delicious as the souvlaki!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon 650 Cafe Bistro this afternoon, and I am so glad I did. They opened to the public for the first time today, and you could order any drink for free! The staff was so kind and gracious, and very eager to make you feel at home. The restaurant itself is beautiful! To top it all off, the owner wanted my advice on a dish, and brought over a full-size stuffed red pepper and asked for my honest opinion. I was apprehensive because I am not the stuffed-red-pepper kinda girl, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would taste dry, and feared that the rice would be mushy. But no, it was perfect! The cheese and sausage really stood out, and I LOVE cheese and sausage!!!

I recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a relaxing meal, in a comfortable, yet beautiful Cafe!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for affordable, healthy and nutritious mediterranean food. The owner always has something fresh for you, since the lunch menu is limited. However, the options are way better and healthier than anywhere else in the vicinity of 1km. My personal favourite is cod with salad and rice. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend this place enough for a quick lunch that'll be light on your wallet."}
