{"text":"I love chicken and Portuguese chicken but this chicken is very dry!! They offer sauce on the chicken or on the side and both options are dry. Fries are decent but I'd rather go to Metro or CoteStLuc BBQ up the street to get a BBQ chicken"}
{"text":"One the best Portuguese chicken places in Montreal! I tried the 1/4 chicken combo (breast, fries, and salad). Great spices and not dry at all (which is tricky when you grill chicken breast). The fries were pretty good as well. Definitely recommend it. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs poulets portugais de Montréal. Pas la peine d'aller sur le plateau pour se régaler. Le seul inconvénient est qu'ils ne livrent pas... Mais il n'y a pas trop problème ppur se garer aux alentours."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken I've had. I much prefer their approach (basting the chicken with sauce vs drowning it once cooked like Ramados). Makes for a crispy skin and a more charcoal flavour. 

It's a family run business, you'll be served by the owners who are very kind. A must try if you're a fan of Portuguese chicken. I certainly miss having it once or twice a week when my office was close by."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese restaurant!!! They would give generous portion of the best Portuguese chicken in Montréal! You will come back for more and more."}
{"text":"I'm new to Montreal, but I've already tried a few Portuguese chicken spots and Da Silva is definitely one of my faves. The fact that it's just a few blocks from our place makes it our go-to. Food-wise, I can only really comment on the combo (chicken, salad, and fries) and while the salad isn't much to gloat about, the fries are pretty solid and the chicken is the grand prize: not too greasy, and grilled just right for my taste. The family meal is also a pretty good option. The staff are wonderful too. 

One very important piece of advice, especially during peak (lunch and dinner) hours would be to order in advance over the phone. Trust me."}
{"text":"Delicious Portuguese chicken! It puts nearby barbecue chicken places to shame. The guys there are very friendly and even take the time to punch holes in their takeout containers so that the fries don't get soggy. Be prepared to wait at least twenty minutes as they grill your chicken (over charcoal) to order, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese chicken. I had the spicy half chicken, great hot sauce they use to grill it."}
{"text":"Dealt with Grillades Da Silva for a social event with coworkers. Incredibly easy to work with and they got our food ready on time!

Mostly went with their quarter chicken breast, fries and salad. Chicken is great and fries are good but salad was quite oily. Also went with their pastel de natas and they were good but I'll admit I've had better.

Overall a pleasure to deal with, would have appreciated if the food could gave been delivered by the street for the event."}
{"text":"SUPERB. I'd heard about this place, but only made it here when my usual sushi spot for lunch was closed for holidays - and I'm glad I did! I'd had Portuguese chicken only once before, and had been very disappointed, and reluctant to try it again. This is well seasoned, and delicious! I don't even like fries, and those are amazing! So glad I gave Portuguese chicken another chance, I'll definitely keep coming here. 

I've asked Yelp to update the address as they're now on Queen Mary!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. It's a small bland place but the food is out of this world. The Portuguese chicken is grilled fresh and is always juicy, the spicy sauce is just that, spicy. The plates are served with salad with a home made dressing and fresh cut fries with a seasoning. Recently I tried their hamburger and I was extremely impressed. The burger is grilled on the same grill as the chicken and couldn't be any better if you made it on your BBQ at home. All in all it's great food at very reasonable prices. My only suggestion is if you have a large order or are more that two people, call ahead."}
