{"text":"Awesome food with good service. My favourite Chinese restaurant at the moment. Try and you'll be back."}
{"text":"La nourriture est très bonne et servi chaud. Le service est très chaleureux. De l'extérieur, le restaurant a l'air désuet, mais à l'intérieur, c'est une autre chose. Il est très propre et plus contemporain par rapport à d'autres Dim Sum. Cependant, il y a deux points négatifs qui sont le prix qui est un peu élevé par rapport d'autres et le stationnement est limité, il faut donc arriver tôt pour avoir une place. Je le recommande quand même. Il faut l'essayer au moins une fois dans votre vie."}
{"text":"Went last night with 9 friends thinking this was a Dim Sum place.  When we found the place we all asked ourselves if we were in the right place.  Look dingy.  But the service was fast and food was amazing as was the price.  Generous portions with good prices.  They didn't have a Table d'hôte but they did have Sharing Menus at different prices.  We were all amazed at what we received as platters on one of the Menus for 6 people we chose, since on normal situations we would not have ordered these dishes.  Very good Vietnamese food!  I would definitely recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"Great spot for Asian cuisine up north of Montreal (St-Michel). They open pretty late which is convenient after my training or late night practice. One of their signature dish: lamb pot (relatively cheap for what it's worth)!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and the service is fast and great! Since there are a lot of construction in front of the restaurant on Saint-Michel, it's better to come in by the back street if you're looking for parking"}
