{"text":"First off, I found it entirely too difficult to find this place. I drove around for like 20 minutes and couldn't find it. I finally had to ask someone at a gas station for directions. You know what this means. If I was a man, I would still be driving (mwahahahaha!). Anyways, The Blue Moose is located at the intersection of Ridge and Pearl in Parma. You may access the driveway from both Pearl and Ridge Roads. I ended up finding it by pulling into the Family Dollar parking lot on Ridge as this was the way the gas station lady suggested.   I was completely freaked out by the outside of the building and afraid that my friend had made me go to another Scorekeepers by the looks of it and the fact that it was neighbors with a Family Dollar. However, inside, the Blue Moose is fun and not at all like Scorekeepers, the most dreaded bar I have ever yelped.   They have several rooms and a large bar area. It is very good for groups. Too bad it was cold on Friday, otherwise we could have gone onto their huge deck.   All in all, it isn't worth driving to Parma for (duh) but if you are meeting up with some old college buddies or something and need to meet in the Parma area, the Blue Moose has my stamp of approval. Grown-up ladies should be warned; eye candy, it does not have."}
{"text":"The Blue Moose has a lot of wing options and the wings are very good.  They also have an amazing patio with the longest tiki bar I've ever seen in my life.  However, it's still not worth dealing with the worst service known to man.   I've been there several times because I kept wanting to give it chances, but it wasn't worth it.  I just left there pissed off and annoyed every time.  Go there with the expectations of our service taking forever (hours), orders getting effed up, not fixing the effed up orders, being out of whatever you want to order, and waiting so long for the check that you eventually go to bar and ask for the manger, then you won't be too disappointed.  They need to train their employees to do more than sit around and talk about how tanked they got the night before.    This place is a major fail."}
{"text":"I can't comment on anything other than the atmosphere. With that said, I'm probably being generous by giving this place 2 stars. I will say the exterior patio is the only shining star in this eyesore.  I was meeting a friend from campus which is the sole reason I stopped at this place. Before I entered I watched a girl vomit all over her friends shoes as they were leaving (who replied, \"haha, you puked on my shoes!\") and a girl who was leaning on the side of a truck fall sideways and crash into the pavement of the parking lot while making out with a guy.  I gave the place a second try a month or so later with a group of friends. The highlight of my evening was sarcastically asking the friend of a girl I was chatting up if she had some psoriasis on her arm. Excitedly she responded that my diagnosis was correct. Yuck."}
{"text":"Don't trust their security. They don't care if the male patrons of the bar assault women. It's \"not their problem\". . .not my scene anyways."}
{"text":"The wings are great.  The food overall is pretty solid.  In the summers, its a very interesting place to people watch on the patio.  You get to see a ton of Affliction, Ed Hardy and Tap Out clothing.  Good drink specials with a ton of entertainment as far as the locals who frequent it.  The patio is pretty great and it makes for a nice happy hour when the weather permits."}
{"text":"OK, I figured it out -- the burger tastes just like a gyro. Don't know what they put in there, and I don't care. It's tasty."}
{"text":"I didn't stop at the Blue Moose for food on a recent trip to Cleveland. I stopped for a few beers and to rub elbows with some locals. I was literally driving down the road and spotted an outdoor tiki bar. I naturally had to give this establishment a try. It was early afternoon and there was only a small hand full of patrons. They have a great outdoor tiki bar that looks 40 yards long. The waitress was a very attractive, highly tattooed young lady that took great care of me. I had a few beer before the happy hour crew started rolling in. $1 domestics will draw a crowd in any state. This place filled up like New Orleans during hurricane Katrina. As usual, I started up a conversation with some nearby customers and the show started. Within 2 more hours I had met in excess of 20 people and had moved to a table full of locals. They were loud, arrogant and boastful but extremely friendly to this ole southern boy. I sadly had to call it a night because of an early flight home but I most definitely will stop by on my next visit. So, if your from out of town and looking for a friendly bar to have a few drink. I highly recommend the infamous Blue Moose!!"}
{"text":"On our way home from a wedding reception, the wife wanted some wings.  So we go where we always go for great wings - Blue Moose.  When we arrived around 11:30 PM, the bar was still hoppin' with patrons and the music was deafening.    I noticed that they remodeled the place a little bit.  They replaced a row of booths with a small dance floor.  Also, they busted out a wall on the lower section and added a second bar, which was nice.  So the place felt a bit roomier.  Another thing I noticed was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the air.  I can't stand cigarette smoke.  It is my biggest pet peve, illegal as it may be indoors in Ohio.  I went up to the stunning bar keep and asked her for a menu.  She quickly abliged.  I placed our order for 10 Hot BBQ wings and 10 Kentucky BBQ wings.  Our wings were ready in 10 minutes, not hours, as indicated in other reviews.  As usual, the wings were spot on.  Hot, big and juicy and full of flavor and they did not disappoint.  The wings are why we go here and they're always good.  Incidentally, as we had just come from a wedding reception plus we both downed a beer with the wings, we had alochol in our blood.  As I went to pull the car around to pick wifey up in the rain, a cop pulled behind my car with his lights on.  For a moment, I was startled, but I realized he was pulling someone over in the parking lot for God knows what at midnight.  Ayway, I was able to back out of my spot without hitting his patrol car :-)"}
{"text":"I don't go here for the music or the party scene; I go for the wings and the wings alone.  In fact, I don't think I've had anything here other than the wings for longer than I can remember!  One of the bartenders definitely uses her...assets to...augment her tips.  I was almost embarrassed for her.  Back to the wings: Blue Moose Cheese is my favorite.  The teriyaki is great too, as are the garlic parmesan, ranch Tonka, and pretty much every other flavor I've tried.  The wings are big and meaty and always perfectly crispy.  If you want to have some of the best wings in the area, but want to avoid the drama of the bar scene, go earlier than later!"}
