{"text":"Very decent espresso. Selection of vancouver roasted coffees. Nice space and friendly service. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a nicely quaint cafe serves breakfast and lunch. We ordered one of each so can only comment on that. The counter girls were helpful and kind. We ordered the crepes with ham. Picture showed asparagus which we were told upfront that it was not available and spinach substituted. We also ordered the chicken, avocado and arugula sandwich. The sandwich was enough for 2 generous portions so we took half to go. The avocado had an overly lemony taste.  Otherwise it was well flavored. The crepes were disappointing. They are the sweet dessert type crepes and the ham was just a few slices of deli ham. So without the asparagus to round out and fill out the crepe it was less than appealing. Latte was good and ssrvice was good."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The kids had bagels and cream cheese, even though they weren't  serving breakfast. My wife and I split paninis one salmon and one basil pesto chicken, both came with a small salad. They were both delicious and the service was very good. It was a very hot day, and the AC was excellent as were the comfy chairs after a morning of walking around Old Montreal."}
{"text":"sandwiches taste really great, crepes, coffee are good as well. Most food on the menu looks heathy and delicious. Great environment, walking distance to old montreal, and the church.   Price is not expensive at all, service is good. I definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, ideal place to go if you are looking for a quiet place with a nice decor and a relaxing music. The menu covers salads, paninis, hot and cold drinks."}
{"text":"spent some time with friends here on a recent trip to Montreal. Cappuccino was very refreshing after a long day's walk around the old town."}
{"text":"Nice music, great location."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Almost everything can be made to be vegetarian végétarienne or vegan so the menu  which consists mostly of salads and hot sandwiches is great. Beer, coffee, orange juice and carrot juice ir served so there is something for everyone. I recommend"}
{"text":"Très bon sandwich"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with healthier options and just happened to walk by. This place has a great selection on sandwiches and salads. Being a vegetarian it tends to be harder to eat out when you don't know the area, but Cafe Veritas had a good vegetarian selection.    Since the menu has pictures, it's very easy to select something tasty. The service was also very quick and helpful. I would recommend this place for a coffee break or lunch."}
{"text":"If you're as fussy about coffee as I am, you will not be disappointed at Cafe Veritas! I tested out several coffee spots recommended on Yelp in the area and this is number #1 for espresso. They use delicious beans and make it just right. The owners are interesting, great to talk to and everyone is friendly!"}
{"text":"Là où le café est un art! Leur café crème est définitivement un must! Sans compter que les proprios sont super sympa, la nourriture est fraîche et santé!"}
{"text":"Very good and healthy options.  Staff was so friendly, kind and considerate.  Close to Palace de Congres for lunch break."}
{"text":"Great place for soups, salads or breakfast . I had a huge breakfast here for only $9 and it was only $1 more for a delicious coffee to go with it! The service was great and the atmosphere very comfortable. Plenty of room and big windows ."}
{"text":"The cafe is near old port Montreal. I ordered an Americano and a scone for my afternoon tea. It was lucky that I found this cafe when carrying heavy loads walking around old Montreal.The atmosphere here is okay but what I ordered are all good. Even better than Starbucks. It's cheap for most of cafes in old Montreal ."}
{"text":"Food seemed very fresh and everything was tasty. Between all of us we were able to try the fruit crepes and the banana hazelnut crepes as well as a bagel and egg sandwich and a very fresh fruit cup. The food was served quickly and it was all very good. The only thing that was a negative is that I wasn't a big fan if the coffee, but I had drop coffee and not any if the espresso offerings that smelled so good."}
{"text":"Unorganized and chaotic place. Mixed up different tables orders; didn't service food in order it was placed and took 30-40 for a sandwich. Good cappuccinos"}
{"text":"Just for the coffee alone it gets 5 stars. I had cappuccinos there for 3 days while visiting and each was fantastic. Made with love and craft and passion. Pastries are solid too and the staff is very friendly and professional. Glad I found this place ! Thanks, Veritas."}
{"text":"First time reviewer of anything, but I do consult these kind of sites when wanting to try something new. As a regular at Veritas, when I came across some of these bad reviews, I decided to finally write a post for all the Veritas regulars out there. I take a detour at least 3-4 times a week to get a cappuccino from Veritas on my way to work. The caps here as good as it gets and I've always been greeted with a smile. Whenever I can, I pass by for a meal here and it's been consistently great. So, for all you haters out there, I don't get it."}
{"text":"It is well worth the few steps around the corner from that giant coffee chain...  We stumbled onto veritas on our 1st day, and made it our 'go to' for cappuccinos for the next 4 mornings."}
{"text":"Fun space, tasty food and super friendly staff. However, several choice salad options were unavailable because the kitchen was understaffed when I arrived."}
{"text":"I did a whole lot of research to find a suitable brunch spot for both my husband and I for our first morning in Montreal. Since it was a Sunday and a holiday weekend, the place we originally wanted to go to was closed. However, I found a highly rated café quite close to our hotel that offers vegan, vegetarian and non-veg brunch items. Café Veritas popped up in almost all of my searches for a casual but reputable brunch location in Old Montreal.   Well, Café Veritas was easy to find. . . I love how their sign connotes it's healthful and fresh cuisine concept.   The inside was very cool--kind of modern and sleek. The menu offerings were posted sort of like you would find in a food court--with pictures--but believe me when I say the atmosphere was far from food court!   We found ourselves a cozy little corner table., and went to the counter to order.  The woman who took our order was so nice!   According to what I read online, Café Veritas aims to serve more healthful cuisine. They have tons of salads and sandwiches, as well as crepes and oatmeal. They're also quite well-known for their coffee beverages and coffee art. Rather than get a fancy latte though, I stuck with a simple cup of black coffee.   I ordered their \"porridge\" cooked in soymilk, with banana, raisins, and walnuts. It also came with honey, but since all of their food is made to order, I requested no sweetener and they happily obliged.   I have to tell you a few things about this breakfasty bowl of goodness. First, this porridge Is advertised as cooked in soymilk, which made it vegan from the get-go. I didn't have to ask for the soymilk--it is normally prepared that way! Second, it was the best oatmeal I have ever eaten in my life. Step aside Le Pain Quotidien. . . there's another amazing oatmeal bowl in town!   The soymilk made it beyond creamy, and while it was a tad more liquidy than I am used to, it made it have a texture like rice pudding! The bananas and raisins provided the right amount of sweetness, and the walnuts gave a nice crunch. The serving size was perfect too--not too much, not too little.   My husband ordered whole wheat crepes with ham and cheese, and he also though his food was fantastic--it was light and fresh and satisfied him without weighing him down.   Café Veritas is so yum-- I would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy breakfast, lunch, or brunch, but it is especially great for those who don't eat meat or dairy as well. They don't even charge extra if you want your latte made out of soy, which is quite a rarity, as most places do charge extra for soymilk."}
{"text":"A big healthy menu and the food is really fresh and delicious! The price is right and it's smack in the middle of tourist zone so that is a great surprise. Got the broccoli soup, breakfast wrap and the chicken avocado and arugula sandwich that comes with a fresh salad. Definitely recommend what we ordered because it was very good and healthy."}
{"text":"Cappuccino was excellent. Free wifi. Sandwiches are very expensive, the highest prices I've seen in Montreal. Perhaps is normal for the old port, but $11 for a sandwich is crazy."}
{"text":"Healthy, friendly, and delicious! Would definitely stop by again for the soup, salad, or sandwich. Definitely would get the coffee again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their veg sandwitch(Légume Grillés et Fromage de Chèvre). Avacado Salad is decent. Service is prompt and prices are cheap given the location."}
{"text":"Awesome place for gourmet sandwiches, crepes and coffee.  Step away a few steps from the old town touristy cafés and you will be very happy you did:-).  Great prices, great food accompanied by great service."}
{"text":"You know what I like? Paninis. And you know what else I like? Coffee.  Done, and done.   Delicious food, amazing service, and fair prices at this very cozy spot surrounded by tourist traps and subpar food joints."}
{"text":"Good food, very fresh, and super-nice staff! The wifi works better if you sit in the main part of the cafe. If you sit down near the door, the signal is variable.  They also have TVs up showing images of beautiful places and happy people. Very soothing.  The salad with avocado and cranberries is fantastic. Even in the dead of winter, the produce is wonderfully fresh.  We come here for breakfast and lunch several times each trip we take to Montreal. And the staff remembers us year to year, which is even nicer!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop in for coffee, a heavy or light lunch. The beverage and pastry options are great, and the ingredients all great quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! :)  We are traveling from the US and they had English menus which made ordering their great food much easier."}
{"text":"We had the mushroom omelette and grilled cheese panini. The omelette taste very fresh. The grilled cheese was so tasty and buttery. It melted in your mouth. Service was quick. The place is clean. It's very chic. It does have free wifi, all you have to do is ask them for the password. The prices are good as well. Overall I am satisfied."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh!  We shared the avocado/blue cheese/spinach salad, as well as the salmon/arugula sandwich. Both portions were good, and the ingredients were high quality. Oh also, my sweetie had a coffee. Apparently, it was quite tasty. The salad was lovely, with tons of fresh spinach, big crumbles of blue cheese, a beautifully ripened  avocado  (sliced ), and several plump tomatoes.  The bread on the sandwich was perfectly toasted, the salmon was good and plentiful. It came with a mixed  bean salad. Overall, the food was good, but it needed a little something more... more dressing for the salad, more aioli for the sandwich, more anything for the bean salad... even a quick spritz of lemon could've helped.  The service and atmosphere were nice, and the restroom was fine. We weren't able to connect to their WiFi for some reason. This is a good place to stop if you want some clean eating... and apparently also if you want crepes, though we didn't try them."}
{"text":"Modern resto cafe in a great location. They have the average salad/sandwich fare (with veg options which is nice), but perhaps takes attention away from the coffee. Ordered a ristretto and an americano with less water. The cashier was a little confused but the barista seemed more knowledgable, although still gave me a cup filled to the top with water for the americano. They're using 49th parallel which is generally good but both coffees tasted over extracted and were served in paper cups. Overall an average experience-maybe a visit earlier in the day would have been better."}
{"text":"I used Yelp to find this cafe when I was looking for a sit down place that serves coffee in real mugs and not paper cups. Yelp didn't let me down. I had a fabulous crepe along with a cappuccino. Service was excellent and very friendly."}
{"text":"Yum! This was a quick bite as we were walking.  Cute little cafe with delicious and strong coffee, with a chocolate crepe! There's also free wifi."}
{"text":"I had just finished running an intense 3-day meeting in Montreal, was hungry and needed good food in a low key setting. Thank you, Yelp, you came through again. Veritas was just the ticket. Previous reviews pointed me to the veggie and feta cheese sandwich - best ever? - and the coffee was strong and delicious. Friendly, efficient staff in a bright, cheerful setting. I can't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Bons produits, bon service mais un peu cher."}
{"text":"We had two veggie sandwiches, both choices were disappointing. They lacked flavour and were blend. The eggplant in one sandwich was not good for consumption anymore and the tofu sandwich could have used a better sauce. It's nice we had salad with the sandwiches (salad was nice) but the sandwiches had too little ingredients.... Overall, we don't believe we'll return to this place. But this being said, service was good and perhaps the meat sandwiches are better."}
{"text":"Stopped at Veritas for lunch based on Yelp recommendations - it met expectations. Centrally located in Old Montreal the menu has a number of healthy offerings. I had the Sesame Chicken Salad which was very good."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick brunch before going out to adventure around the Port for the day, and what a great choice it was! Eggs were cooked perfectly and substitutes were generously done as we requested with no extra charge. The spinach and sundried tomato wrap with added bacon is a must-have. Try the delicious latte for a morning pick-me-up!"}
{"text":"The cafe looks nice and is very quiet. They have lots of nice seating areas, if you're ever in the area, I would recommend it for students.  I got a smoothie to share and it was delicious, it was strawberry Banana and you could taste all the individual ingredients. It felt very smooth.   I haven't tried the food but I can't wait to!"}
{"text":"Le café est excellent et le reste est aussi bon. Il faut y aller !"}
{"text":"Exactly what I needed after an indulgent dinner the night before.  If I could give this place 4.5 stars, I would. But I'm not normally a fan of raw green leaves but these salads were well done. I can vouch for the following:   - shrimp and roasted onion salad over a frisée romaine and red leaf lettuce mix with corn and tomatoes  - smoked salmon (as good as lox) with a delicious dill vinaigrette and croutons and red onions over spinach   - mixed berry smoothie (a little heavy on the yoghurt for my taste)   Our friends were very happy with the eggplant and mozzarella sandwich and banana Nutella crepe."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you want to get away from tourists in the old montreal area. It has vegetarian food with is definitely a plus. Also the music is good."}
{"text":"Nice spot, air-conditioned and casual. Americano was so-so apparently the bagles are amazing though! Enormous salads, the avocado salad was a killer. Really like the blue cheese instead of standard chevre they used in that one.   Not to expensive and the staff is nice, and if I may say so myself,  quite beautiful as well, always a plus."}
{"text":"So... this place is DEFINITELY NOT vegan.  And not vegetarian either.  It has vegetarian options, which I suppose makes it practically vegan in Montreal, but still.  The vegetarian options they do have, though, are wonderful.  And you can read it in French or English!  I got the Mediterranean salad, for $10 CA, and it was wonderful.  Big and delicious, with massive chunks of feta and juicy kalamata olives.  All the other salads that came out looked great too, and I realized too late that they had my favorite soup-- corn chowder.  Easy walking distance from the Palais des Congres... and right next to Subway.  Makes you wonder how Subway could possibly get any business at all... Unless patrons are turned away by the slightly-treacherous step down to the restrooms.  Completely logical."}
{"text":"We ordered easily and they have a great selection of 'twas (kusmi). When my father in law asked about buying a bag of beans the barista took time to let him taste both before he made his decision."}
{"text":"Good prices. The coffee was very good. They steam the milk automatically for your coffee. Bagel with cream cheese was very good, best part of meal, ordered a side of smoked salmon. Crepe with berries was good too. Roasted potatoes with omelette were a miss, season and flavor were wrong for a breakfast/brunch. Omelette was not good, more of a frittata than omelette. I should of used salt and pepper but did not. Egg flavor was off."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch here. I had the Grilled Veggie Sandwich and even asked if they could swap the cheese out for avocado. They were pleasant and easy to work with! The sandwich was delicious. I also had a cranberry orange smoothie, flavor was great but a little too much pulp for me at the end. Clean, inviting restaurant. Definitely recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here on 3rd morning and was very impressed. Nice big open clean space.  I had an excellent latte and a bagel egg and mushroom sandwich.  Husband had black coffee and egg and herb sandwich.  My daughter had hot chocolate which she said was best she's had and a blueberry muffin.  Prices were the most reasonable we have come across.  The owner was very friendly.  Would definitely recommend.  My favorite so far (also went to cafe mon plaisir and moulin lafayette).  We'll be going back tomorrow for our last morning."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This is not an upscale place but it's just perfect for a hearty lunch that won't break the bank. I ordered their veggie mozzarella panini sandwich which came with a lovely chickpea salad. I am usually not the type to finish my entire meal but after a horrible lunch at some upscale hotel down the street, I finished the entire sandwich AND salad (and that is after already \"having lunch\")  This is not a tourist trap and you will get your money's worth. It's clean and healthy and affordable."}
{"text":"Après une rencontre au palais de justice, j'ai trois problèmes: j'ai faim, jai besoin de café et je dois trouver un endroit où il y a du wifi pour conclure une chronique.  Je m'installe donc au café le plus près. Il peut répondre à mes trois besoins les plus criants.  C'est un espace a deux demi-étages, très éclairé. Banquettes disponibles. Grand choix de salades et de panini.   Je commande un sandwich aux légumes grillés et fromage de chèvre. Voyons, le sandwich est froid, je ne m'attendais pas à ça. Les aubergines dépassent de partout et sont un peu crunchy et il faut les mâchouiller avec insistance. Si j'avais eu les dents un peu moins solides, je serais sûrement encore sur place à mâcher mes aubergines. Poivrons, oignons et zucchini sont aussi au rendez-vous, mais en quantité moindre. Bravo pour le pain, par contre, un très bon ciabatta aux fines herbes. La petite salade de légumineuses qui accompagne le plat était aussi très bonne.   Je commande un allongé noir pour soulager mon manque de caféine. J'ai déjà vu pire café, mais surtout meilleur café. Du 49th parallel est en vente, je crois que c'est aussi celui qu'ils servent.  Le service: accueil sans artifices, menu déjeuner encore affiché alors qu'il n'est plus servi (déception, j'aime les saucisses à déjeuner, ne soyez pas tease comme ça svp), et 3 serveuses qui viennent me demander à tour de rôle si j'ai terminé mon plat alors que je n'ai même pas entamé ma salade. À la troisième, je l'ai mangée assez vite merci!  L'endroit n'est pas très chaleureux, mais semble être très populaire pour les étudiants et travailleurs des alentours qui sont sur leur heure de lunch: à midi, l'attroupement autour du comptoir pour commander était impressionnant.  Bref, c'est un endroit correct pour soulager des besoins pressants comme les miens cet avant midi. Toutefois, l'expérience ne vaut pas la peine d'être vécue à nouveau à mon avis."}
{"text":"I had cheese bagel with salmon and BLT sandwich. Taste awful."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here on our first day in Montreal. My sister ordered a chicken-cranberry salad that looked out of this world. I ordered the crepes with ham/asparagus/swiss. My crepe had a touch of sweetness that I didn't care for in what I expected to be a savory dish, but it was cooked well.   This is a nice casual eatery, with healthy options. I would return...and order the salad. Our meals with drinks cost $30 CAD."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Best tasting coffee we had in Montreal. The staff/owner was friendly and gave us the scoop on places to visit."}
{"text":"Breakfast flat bread sandwiches are great.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelette flat bread sandwich. Very light but filling with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Crepe taste creepy! Very dry and not juicy at all. Disappointed since it has high stars in yelp right now."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and salads... And one of the best coffees in town. I am very picky about my coffees and I must say this is very close to Myriad. Highly recommend this place if you want decent good quality food and don't want to be ripped!"}
{"text":"lovely casual place. but the wifi didn't work for me. bummer that crepes are only served for breakfast!!! till 11.30am.  salads looked huge.  sandwiches are delicious. thanks to the lady's recommendation, i ordered the chicken avocado & arugula.THE BREAD. omgosh. hello there. soft not overbearing. scrumptious by itself or with the sandwich. give me more please. it also came with a small side of quinoa mixed with cucumbers, dressing, red cabbage, etc."}
{"text":"We stopped here to fuel up with breakfast before sightseeing. A nice varied menu - everyone in the family found something they liked, from eggs and toast to crepes. I had the porridge and it was creamy and delicious. Friendly staff, great service. A perfect start to the day."}
{"text":"Great coffee! We didn't order anything to eat so I can't recommend but the coffee is really good!"}
{"text":"The interior appears to have been renovated in approximately 2008 and is starting to look dated. Large menu of paninis, lunch-type food. Coffee was acceptable, a touch better than chain fare but on the whole uninteresting - if you're not pressed for time, Café 1880 on St-Denis or Pourquoi Pas on Amherst are superior options in this part of the city."}
{"text":"Mon go to pour un excellent café dans le coin du palet de justice. Vous ne pouvez tout simplement pas être déçu!  Si vous avez un peu plus de temps et que vous cherchez quelque chose de bon à manger dans le coin et de pas trop cher, tous les plats au menus sont très bons, frais, et les portions sont généreuses."}
{"text":"Nothing special, just a place to get a quick and healthy bite to eat. Disappointed that the Orange and carrot juice wasn't fresh squeezed, the price indicted as such."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove 6 hours fron NY to Old Montreal. We were famished on arrival and as vegetarians we needed to find the right place. Well we sure did at Cafe Veritas. A large selection to choose from, well prepared food and delicious !!. The service was wonderful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick healthy bite.   Food seem a bit uneven, I had a pulled pork wrap, which was the special of the day, and I liked it. 11$99 and it came with a salad, worth it.   Some people were with me and I was not so enthusiast about the other things I tried, breakfast wrap was a bit plain and boring.  And the crepe with fresh fruit was disappointing too.   A mocka to pass this all down, average.  Quick and efficient service, fruits and veggies seem fresh enough."}
{"text":"The coffee service is delicious and the proprietor is Wen is fantastic. He provides only the best service and his staff also doesn't disappoint. Breakfast was very affordable and delicious. For $20 we each had coffee, eggs, ham or bacon, toast, home fries and fruit salad. Only the freshest tasting ingredients were used. I highly recommend for any American visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"El panini estuvo bueno pero en relación al costo-beneficio esperaba algo más, la verdad me lo pude haber ahorrado."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price!  I had the Tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich, which was delicious.  They challenged me to compare their cafe mocha to that 'other' coffee shop's version and I must say it was very good!  If I return to Montreal, I will visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant to start your day, whether you're just picking up coffee to go or sitting down for a meal.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. Just order at the counter and then take a seat, they'll bring your food out when it's ready. I had the special breakfast burger, which was really good.   They have a cool orange juice machine that looks a bit like a Rube Goldberg machine, you can watch as it squeezes your juice right out of the oranges. It's probably a pain to maintain it, but the juice was great and it was fun to watch. Plus, how can you beat fresh-squeezed OJ?"}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee over the weekend. Well-made cappuccinos. Modern, clean décor. Friendly service from the gentleman behind the counter (the owner perhaps?)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff to a foreigner. Exceptional coffee and cappuccino. Recommend this place to locals and out of towners."}
{"text":"Lots of salads and sandwiches. Also eggs and crepes. I had a cranberry chicken salad and it was a generous portion. Friendly service and quiet and spacious. Relaxed atmosphere. The location is elevated, so you overlook the street."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it certainly did not wow me enough to return. I had a chocolate and banana crepe. I enjoyed it as much as any other run of the mill crepe. This could be a case of ordering the wrong item on the menu, but I am a bit perplexed by some of the more favorably enthusiastic reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in here for a coffee and lunch. I ordered the sesame baked chicken salad and a cappuccino. The service was helpful and friendly, my cappuccino art was beautiful and the salad was fresh and delicious. If you are craving some healthy eats and delicious coffee in Montreal this is the place to hit up. I'm coming back for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"It's always great when you can have a healthy option that' also happens to be delicious. This is definitely one of hose places and to make matters even better, this service is excellent.  Stopped in here for lunch after wanting something fairly healthy. I got the chicken pesto panini sandwich which also comes with peppers. It's was absolutely delicious and to make it better its all organic and low in fat. The sandwich wasn't drowning in pesto and even the breast tastes extremely fresh.  The lady who works there could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. She explained almost everything on the menu in detail and went out of her to present it in English since I'm American. Couldn't ask for a better overall experience. Ill absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Discovered it on our short visit here from CT. Coffee drinks are very good, as are the pastries, and the service is excellent. I didn't try any of the breakfast dishes yet but I'm sure they are also good. Wen, who I presume is the owner, has a great sense of humor and gave me lots of tips on places to go and places to eat."}
{"text":"Wandering around old port and trying to find a spot to eat and study, Café Varitas is the spot! Their portions are really big, price is fair (9$-12$ for their salads and sandwiches), unless many places in old port. Their coffee is decent, comes with charming latte art, it was a very pleasant experience and I enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"If you're staying in Vieux Montreal and you're going broke because of all of the fantastic (read: expensive) dining by night, save some coin during the day by heading to Cafe Veritas for breakfast.  Really tasty, healthy options.  And soooo affordable too!  2 yummy egg sandwiches on bagels=$8 CAD.  The staff is friendly.  The atmosphere's clean and cozy too."}
{"text":"Staff were very helpful and a very clean place. Their chairs and tables were wobbly and my tea did not have a lot of flavor.  My boyfriend's lattes were not that bad."}
{"text":"If you are a coffee lover, DON'T go here.  Although its quite true that the decor is really modern and nice inside, the coffee is terrible.  I didn't try anything on the menu, but will never go back here again."}
{"text":"J'ai été quand même surprise en me rendant dans ce café, J'y suis allée pour un café à cause du Indie Coffee Passport et mon latte était pas mal bon. Ce qui m'a surprise par contre, c'est la sélection de salades ÉNORMES en plus de paninis, de wraps et d'autres plats maison. J'ai pris la salade betteraves grillées et fromage de chèvre. Elle était bonne sans rien de plus, ni de moins. Les betteraves n'étaient pas hyper grillées et auraient eu besoin de quelques minutes de cuissons d'extra pour être vraiment bonnes. Le fromage de chèvre est très bon plus la laitue (romaine) était aussi bien fraîche et parfaitement assaisonnée d'une vinaigrette simple sans en être détrempée. Les noix de Grenoble ajoutaient un petit croquant mais elles ne goûtaient pas grand chose. Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, ça me fait un peu penser aux chaînes à café de style Van Houtte ou bien Presse Café, alors ça ne sort pas vraiment de l'ordinaire, mais c'est quand même bien."}
{"text":"This cafe may or may not be the cutest cafe in world and here's why (mind you that I have an awfully weird definition of cute).  First, insert viral YouTube video of the woman peeling the avocado because almost all the salads and sandwiches have this wonderful superfood.  So...Health freak? Check. Nuts (WALNUTS!!!), fruit (TANGERINES!!!), avocado (YES!!!!), cheese, root vegetables (BEETS!!!) are all possible toppings on the set salad you can choose. There's around 15 salad options available, so really the problem won't be finding something to eat... it'll be deciding what to eat.  Each sandwich comes with a little pickled carrot salad (heads up, they look like beets because they're red!) It's not that tasty, but I would say it's comparable to the pink ginger you get with sushi... a Palette cleanser.   I had two things - the Chicken Avocado sandwich and the Porridge.  The Chicken Avocado sandwich was pretty standard. The bread was toasted to perfection (thin, soft, and crispy on the edges). The chicken was a bit bland and dry... not a fan. The avocado was ripe and the rest of the filling was super fresh.  The porridge on the other hand... was absolutely amazing. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and had walnuts and fruits which elevated the flavours of the dish. The portion sizes they gave could honestly feed around three people, and it was only a little over $6+. Not bad!  My friends had the breakfast crepe. They found the crepe to be extremely delicious, but was filled with far too much cottage cheese.  Overall, do come to Cafe Veritas if you are a lover of all things healthy. Don't come here if you are looking for a REAL Quebecois cafe though. Don't be fooled (ironically) by the name - it's not authentic. Nonetheless, it's still fairly good."}
{"text":"Cafe Veritas is a wonderful local cafe in the heart of Old Montreal. Very open layout, with lots of seating, free wifi, and a large menu. The menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads, with some crepes and typical coffee shop drinks. The hot chocolate is delicious here and the service is very friendly!"}
