{"text":"Great service every time!!! The food is sooooo good every time we go! Never yet to be disappointed and would tell anyone who loves good bar food to come here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Large menu   they even have healthy choices on their menu.  Also run lots of specials and have coupons if you go on their website."}
{"text":"The homemade food and quality service make this my go to place several times a week.  Two times a week there is trivia contest, one or twice a week karaoke and live entertainment on many Fridays.
The hamburgers are tremendous.  The appetizers are delicious and a great variety and are on special daily from 5-7.

Don't delay.  Make a point to visit, eat,drink and enjoy a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"The first time we went I was not a big fan. We tried it again tonight and was really good. The stuffed hot pepper pasta was amazing. Will definitely go back, but not on Sunday night...got stuck in the trivia game."}
{"text":"Had the Philly Streak with sweet potato fries. Delicious! The wedding soup is excellent! Everything is homemade. Will definitely come back if in Bridgeville again!"}
{"text":"I had a great fish sandwich here, more than I can eat. It was well prepared and delicious. Patti, the waitress, did an excellent job and was very congenial. I will return."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service...just moved to the area and have to say we'll be coming to Shelby's Station many more times in the future. Had the Thai Burger, Pot Roast Nachos and fried raviolis...had planned on getting dessert but the entree portions were so big I had to push until the next time we eat there! Great place to eat in da 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my wife but I will be coming back more.  My last visit (January 2016) I had a beer battered chicken sandwich with fresh cut fries.  Sandwich was excellent and competitively priced.  My wife had the three cheese grilled cheese which she also enjoyed.  We were here during happy hour so appitizers were half off (breadsticks were tasty).  They also have 2.25 Miller Lites all day Friday.  

The service was better my first visit which is why I knocked it down a star.  It appeared to be during a shift change which might have caused the delay.  

Bar is very clean, has a small parking lot in the back.  No smoking.  It is definitely a hidden gem in Bridgeville.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Pot roast nachos had chunks of beef instead of shredded beef.  Cheese sauce was cold.  Italian hoagie has thick slice ham, dressing was salty, fresh cut fries were loaded with salt, be prepared to have an increase in your blood pressure when leaving this place."}
{"text":"After driving past countless times, stopping in was a pleasant surprise.  This is the kind of place that makes Pittsburgh special.  It is everything a local pub should be:  warm and welcoming with good honest food.  Regular or newcomer, you'll feel right at home.  Even after another cold day in this endless winter, the people in Shelby's were actually happy.  They were decorating for Easter...it was a wonderful pastel kitschy explosion!
The stuffed banana peppers were as good as any I've had and the meat sauce on my ravioli was real homemade...delicious!  Add a glass of decent house wine and what more could you want?  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was moderate and perhaps a 3.5 star. We had from salads to burgers or chicken parm. The desserts were great. We had the tortilla bowl and we had the chocolate cake. The burger was a bit heavy on garlic and the sauce on the chicken parm was very rich. To take the family there is so-so bc it's a all bar setting. To grab a bite and beer with the spouse. .good place for it. The bartender -server was phenomenal but I forget her name. I'll probably try here again but not with the entire family."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the food at Shelby's Station. My favorite is their Italian hoagie but everything is good. The portion sizes are quite generous too. Saturday nights is karaoke & I always have a great time there. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went last night with friends. Great crowd fun enviroment karaoke going on. Busy bar. Food was awsome had abunch of apps and a couple sandwiches. Was with a couple friends. Service was excellent. Never had to wait for anything. Drinks always full and she was so friendly. Great place for a fun night out with friends. We will go back."}
{"text":"Co-worker and I were looking for something to eat locally. We found Shelby's online. We both loved our meals. It's classic American dining, but done right. The ingredients are good, and the flavors are perfect. The best part? The service was perfect too, which isn't a must for me, but is a big plus."}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon for this place and forgot about it until it was near the expiration date...so I grabbed my niece for a desperation-use-the-Groupon lunch.  It's a fairly cheerful little bar with both booths and tables, and we chose a booth.  There were placemats and napkin-wrapped silverware already on the table, and we both became pretty apprehensive when we opened our silverware and discovered that all of it appeared to have been taken from a dirty table and re-wrapped in a clean napkin.  Our server quickly apologized and brought us clean, so we decided to stay.  We ordered the spinach-artichoke dip in a bread bowl to share as our app.  The presentation was nice, the dip was hot and very flavorful, and the bread bowl had the right combination of crunch and soft.  Also, generous pieces of artichoke with none of those nasty hard pieces you sometimes find.  My niece and I both decided on the fish sandwich, she with fries and slaw, I with fries and a bowl of wedding soup.  My soup arrived first, and I have to say that this was THE BEST wedding soup I have EVER had!!  Genuine Italian recipe with finely shredded chicken and teeny-tiny meatballs, and a wonderfully flavorful broth.  My niece agreed that it was great.  Then came our entrees.  The fish on each sandwich was HUGE!  We're talking Trump could use them for his barrier wall huge!  The fries were fresh-cut and fine.  My niece's slaw missed the mark with us--WAY too much vinegar.  You want a bit of vinegar for tang, but not so much that it obliterates the taste of the slaw, right?  Both of us were too full to even try the fish, but we had it later and it was quite good.  Did I mention the wedding soup was awesome?  We got 2 quarts to go!!  As we live in McKees Rocks, Bridgeville is out of the way for us, but we will be coming back, and probably with the whole fam!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, decided to try this place and it didn't disappoint. Started with seafood bisque, which had huge chunks of crab meat in it! It was a tad salty for my taste but that didn't keep me from scraping the bowl clean.

For entree I had pasta with garlic wine sauce. Tomatoes and zucchini on it were fresh and it was loaded with garlic. Chicken was crispy and portion was generous - had to take half of it home.

Service was friendly; a bit slow but it was a busy Friday night. There was live music, which was very good, and there are great drink specials every night.

All around nice neighborhood place, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I was really hungry during trivia, so I ordered something different, the \"Stuffed Banana Pepper Pizza.\"  Finally, something here at Shelby's that I thought was really good.  This was the first time I ever ordered pizza here, and was pleasantly surprised.  Even though it was pretty spicy (hot sausage and yellow banana peppers), I really enjoyed the taste.  I gave one slice to my Mother-In-Law, and she was totally caught off-guard by the heat, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Always a favorite, Shelbys food is soooo good. Tonight was Pepperoni and Sausage pizza. Great classic pizza, one of the ultimate comfort foods. Crust was crunchy and light, great sauce, ample toppings, with a side of Ranch dressing, a great classic pizza. Also with dinner, an order of Sweet Thai Chili wings. A whole wing, crunchy, nice blend of spicy and sweet Thai Chili sauce, full meaty wings, delicious. Shelby's is a favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Really good food!  Try the veal and spinach ravioli. Wings are great as are the salads."}
{"text":"We love coming to Shelby's! Good beer, good food, good atmosphere! A nice local place to come for late night food, and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"The hub and I stopped here on a hunger-pang driven whim. They had just opened, so it was super empty (as sports-type bars usually are that early.) The server was very friendly, and seemingly well-seasoned (maybe it was Shelby herself! ^_^ ) She was pretty cool. 
We had read in the Yelp-Bible that their fish sandwich was pretty good...so in Yelp we trust.
It did take a hot second to actually get the sandwiches, but it was sooo worth it! First of all, they were like the length of my arm..so maybe they should've advertised them as \"subs\" instead. Second, they were so absolutely freshly cooked! Yum! *stomach growls* The batter could've used a pinch of salt, but hey, I had some at the table - problem solved. The coleslaw was unique...I'd never tasted that type of dressing before...it was as if coleslaw dressing, thousand island, and big mac sauce had a threesome and out popped a love child -  but it worked...we both slathered on the tartar (which tasted like it was made in-house) and lumped on the coleslaw and went to town on those babies. I could only finish half of it, but my tummy was a happy camper afterwards! Oh, the fries were good too! Yay!
Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the doors opened about 5 years ago and I have yet to be disappointed. All of the homemade food is incredible and it's obvious that the owner, Michele, puts her heart and soul into everything. The staff is also extremely friendly. It's a very neighborly place where the regulars become friends and friends become family. 
I would highly recommend Shelby's Station to anyone who is looking for a fun and tasty new place to go!
P.S. Try the pepperoni pizza with white sauce. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I had initially had this place 2 years ago, when they had the stuffed burgers on the menu. It was a great experience. I kept forgetting it existed because it is such a hole-in-the-wall.

Fast forward to last Friday. I remembered it during our strategic planning meeting (aka, where are we going for lunch). Everyone was on board with giving it a try. We showed up about 12:15 and there were 4 other people there, it was a slow day, so that was nice. We all ordered burgers. They offered to specially make the buffalo chicken stuffed burger for me, and it was as amazing as I remember. But since it is not on the menu I'm not going to review it. Instead I'll tell you about my coworkers' experiences.

3 of my coworkers ordered their House Favorite Burger. They were all impressed, it was delicious, moist yet not too greasy. They said it was like a BigMac, just done right.

The fourth..well he ordered the buffalo and bleu cheese burger. Normally he is a noncommital person, we'll get a \"That was good\" or a \"Eh, it's ok\" out of him. After the first bite he was \"Wow, this is an excellent burger!\", then between every consecutive bite he would say things like \"Uh, that is good\" or \"Mmmm\". It is monday and he is still talking about how excellent the burger was.

With the burgers came some homemade fries, they were excellent. Not too crisp, not too limp.. just right.

Everybody at work agrees that this is a PERMANENT addition to our lunch roster.

ALSO! I would like to mention their \"Sinfully Shelby's\" dessert. HOLY CRAP! This thing was amazing. It is tortilla, stuffed with Cookie Dough, deep fried, with hot fudge and ice cream! It is addictive and awesome! Though a little small in portions, but cheap."}
