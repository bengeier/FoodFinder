{"text":"I am impressed with the service and food presentation overall. Myself coming from hospitality background highly recommend checking out this place with my friends, family and coworkers. The female server, Jia, whom was serving us showed excellent service."}
{"text":"I don't usually like trying new sushi places but my boss said this place was great! I would definitely have to agree and the service was wonderful!! My waitress was so accommodating im very picky and didn't know what I want and she did a great job at helping me figure it out!! As well as the chef saw I was having difficulty and made me a role he thought I might like the mountain role it was my favorite!!! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Restaurant!! Staff: 5/5 for customer service  Food: 5/5 for quality, quantity & presentation  Chicken Teriyaki: So juicy and thick. I loved how they don't drench it in sauce, just a little glaze, with a side of teri sauce.   Veggie Tempura: A LOT of veggie, little tempura! Perfect crunch and not greasy.   California Roll: Perfect size, simple, not a lot of rice. Perfect!  Shumai: I believe it was shrimp, nice golden brown color, great flavor and the sauce was delicious.   Volcano Roll: Wish it was a little spicier but over all, flavor, texture, presentation and tempura was spectacular.   So glad they're right around the corner!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This used to be our favorite restaurant to frequent as a family.  However the quality of service has dramatically decreased in the last couple of months.    I am actually composing this review from the restaurant where we have waited over an hour just to receive our soup. Upon our arrival, we were seated at the hibachi grill section and had to wait 10 minutes for the server to greet us, another 10 minutes to receive water, and another...hold on...20 minutes to order drinks.  Then after we place our order, the server informed us that they don't have the salad that goes with the dinner, but doesn't offer any compensation or discount.  The cook who prepared our food had absolutely no personality or flare, nor was he a hibachi chef.  We could've gone to  a regular restaurant to be merely served a steak.    Realistically, the 2-star rating is too generous. But I'm hoping that the last 2 experiences are apparitions as opposed to the new standard.   ...Oh, by the way, the server's name is Richard.  He has been terrible both of the last two times we have come.  One time it was busy, the other time it was not.  Regardless, his service is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"We ordered some yellowtail and salmon sushi and were little disappointed of the thickness on the sushi. That kind of thin sliced sushi would be found at all you can eat sushi restaurants. However, it was not too bad at all. The server was pleasant and the interior was intimate and private."}
{"text":"The service sucks here. You wait 30 mins for your 2nd order including bill. My first time here but will never come back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food, great people. Highly recommend this place. One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant food is ok, but the chef and server they don't know the menu, been there two times and they still make me a wrong set, they all need more training...."}
{"text":"Sushi taste really fresh every time we've come! We also like the dinner bento boxes! Great deal for the price and everything taste great! We also tried the hibachi and we liked it as well. We like that they are open late and have happy hour specials.'"}
{"text":"We ordered the sashimi combo, lobster, & ribeye. The sushi tasted really fresh but compared to other places I've been, the pieces were cut a little smaller than what I'd like. Ribeye was tender & juicy that went well with the sauces they provided. Lobster was delicious!   Restaurant was beautiful inside but when we went there was no music & not that many people so the vibe felt kind of dead.   Will come back again!"}
{"text":"We went there to try the all you can eat late last night which was very convenient. My husband enjoyed all the rolls he got. I got teriyaki chicken since raw fish is a no no for me right now but it came out on a hot skillet so it was good! Also our server's name was Derrick and I recommend asking for him because he provided amazing service and really tries to connect with each table!"}
{"text":"First time & I loved it. Clean, cheap, and great happy hour options. Wish we would have taken pictures before, but we just dug in."}
{"text":"THEY GIVE FREE DESSERT FOR YELP REVIEWS...So expect inflated reviews. Very sub-par sushi - the fish wasn't very fresh and had a dried out look and the rolls were poorly/loosely wrapped. This isn't a steakhouse...wasn't a single steak on the menu."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the Southwest. Sashimi and nigiri very fresh, has happy hour and most recently AYCE options. Service is friendly on the two occasions that I've been there. Cant speak for the hibachi side since Ive never tried it but this will be my new go-to sushi spot since it is around the corner from my house"}
{"text":"Bonsai offers a wide variety of Japanese dishes. They have a whole section for hibachi. The crowd there seemed happy but I opted for regular sushi stuff. I had a soft shell crab appetizer and a girashi. The crab was big and well prepared. The fish were fresh and tasty. Their hot sake was good too. Both my waiter and the maitre d were very courteous and attentive. I highly recommend this place for good Japanese food."}
{"text":"Go here next. Great atmosphere! Ric is amazing! Great for work events or date night. Awesome place. Popping music."}
{"text":"This place is garage.  It is bright as can be and completely over priced for what looks like somewhere that would have a drive thru. Customer service at its worst on top of it all. Over all a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing and food was soooo delicious!!! I called ahead to see what the wait time was and they were happy to put me on the list!! The entire staff was very friendly and happy to help each other out. All around a great environment! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family he food is amazing and the people are so nice this place deserves more than 5 stars the only thing I would change is that the bathroom doesn't always smell good but other than that I love bonsai. My family and I have been here more than 3 times  and every time they never fail to disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at great prices! Was really happy with everything we tried. The staff were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean and new. We had the tuna nigiri and it was vey fresh. We also tried multiple rolls and hibachi lobster, it was delicious. This is the place to go for sushi! Plus your first beer is free!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp looking for good sushi around my house. My wife and I love sushi and are semi new to the area so we wanted to find a new place to call our sushi home! It was my birthday the day we decided to try Bonsai so we were really hoping to have a good experience. We made a reservation for 5:45pm and we're running a little late so we didn't make it there until 6:00pm. As soon as we walked in we were promptly greeted with 3-4 smiling faces . We apologized for being late to our reservation and they immediately assured us it was absolutely no problem at all. We asked to sit at the sushi bar which they gladly took us too. Richard was our server and we got our drink orders taken almost immediately. Along with appetizers . We were just going to go with ale carte and order our rolls separate(which was going to be about 3 rolls each for my wife and I) Richard quickly recommended that we do the all you can eat because we would actually be saving money. The 3 rolls we ordered were going to be more than the all you can eat price. So we agreed to do that. Richard heard us talking about it being my birthday and asked me if it was!! I said yes!! He said well you can to the right place because you get your meal for free! (Which was a $26.00 value) The chefs were VERY attentive to us and made sure all of our needs were taken care of! We had a show to go to so we had to leave at a certain time and Richard made sure our check was there and ready so we could be on time . Every aspect of this experience was 5 star. We will definitely be coming back! I recommend asking for Richard because he is just amazing at what he does. You can tel his number one goal is to make the customer happy! Cannot wait to return to Bomsai!! The sushi was amazing !! And they all sang to me for my birthday! What an incredible night!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. Hibachi is amazing. All spices used by chef enhance the flavor of all the food. Definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! First, we sat our self down because no one paid attention or greeted us. We sat at our table for 15 minites, being ignored, until I had to ask for a menu. Water didn't even come until 20 minutes later and that's because I had to ask our server for some water.  They served us our soup and salad (we got the salad for free because the server screwed up our ordered and gave us salad instead of the miso soup we ordered) and once again I had to request for some utensils so we could start eating.  I ordered the fish tempura which is fried salmon and tempura veggies. The salmon was horrible. No season at all. They straight fried it with no seasoning so all you got was a mouth full of panko.  The restaurant been open for 5 months (mind you its a small restaurant) and the servers were struggling with orders and running sushi to the wring tables. The table that was sitting next to us also complained about their service, so I knew it wasn't us and that it was the restaurant that was horrible!  A little advise to Bonsai Restaurant- NEVER IGNORE YOUR CUSTOMERS! ALWAYS GREET THEM REGARDLESS IF YOUR BUSY OR NOT!  Note to self - NEVER go there again"}
{"text":"Great experience. Attentive service. All around good time.    The only thing lacking is the white sauce for the hibachi grill.  They have one, if you ask, in the back and it is basically mayo.  Not the yum yum sauce, or \"white sauce\" from other places of this kind.    We will come back.  The sushi platters with the ice sculptures are sweet."}
{"text":"My sister and brother in law took me here for my birthday. We had the hibachi. The chef was a hoot and the food was awesome. The whole night was one to remember. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! the service was fantastic & the food was great. we ordered 11 items on the menu & our tab came out to only a 100$!! David is such a sweet chef. highly recommended"}
{"text":"Really nice place to eat and the food is so good hibachi is the best and the chef is funny i like him gonna come back for sure"}
{"text":"Uh, it's hard to believe this place has enough friends and family to get 4 stars. We had bad food compounded by worse service. I don't get it: it wasn't busy, considering it was Valentines Day.  We were seated quickly and our drinks and miso soup came quickly. The soup wasn't hot,  the salad was Iceberg with a nondescript dressing soaking it.  After that,  things went downhill. The waitress disappeared to concentrate on a birthday group. We had to ask for everything else from more water to Wasabe. The Rainbow roll was good; the Crunchy Roll had a peculiar texture and was bland. The Tempura Shrimp and Vegetables rank as some of the worst I've had: the batter was so heavy,  you couldn't taste the shrimp; the texture of the batter varied from mushy and undercooked to chewy. When we finally saw our waitress, again,  she brought our bill. We told her we hadn't yet received our Hamachi Kama. She replied they were out and redid our bill.   Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Loved it here, came for my birthday & the staff were amazing! Sat at the sushi bar & was treated like a princess. Food came out quick & fresh. I had the sushi guy make me a special quail egg shooter!   Very clean,  the decor is on point. Restrooms are really clean & they provide mouth wash.   They sung happy birthday to me with dim lights & music. Along with fried green tea ice cream.  I highly recommend this place, cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"ayce. love it. food:excellent decor:appealing to the eye.  would return."}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered the Bento. It came with soup, salad, choice of meat, tempura, California roll, Spring roll or shumai, and rice for $15.95. Quite delicious, not mind blowing but good for sure! Decor is sleek and clean. The plating of the sushi we saw come out was beautiful as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped by randomly and am super glad we did! Amazing food! Best sushi we've had in Vegas and our server Alice was amazing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good.  I used to frequent Bonsai for their sushi lunch specials.  Blue Fin Sushi (BF on Rainbow) opened up closer to my work.  So, I opt to go there these days.  But, for dinner, I hooked up with a couple of friends of mine for a Hibachi Dinner...  It was bland.  Hibachi chef said, \"I don't use salt because I use soy sauce...\"  Dude...just use _some_ salt.  I shut my face just to be nice...  But, in the end....it was subpar."}
{"text":"I went here for the free birthday dinner (no excuse not to try it! but I think you need the coupon..) and invited a bunch of friends. The food was awesome and the entertainment even better. They treated me and my friends and family very well and were very attentive. We were laughing so hard as the chef made dinner I had tears in my eyes. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely great service.  Great staffs and quality of food.  Watch out for Chef Thurston, he has great sense of humor and amazing performance.  Also, Erin is a wonderful server.  Had a great time with the family on my Birthday.  Definitely, this is my new favorite Japanese / Hibachi Restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh meat, chicken and sushi. Great hibachi chefs and servers, especially Ric. Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  My go to in the area.  All you can eat menu doesn't have all there normal sushi items but the ones on there will fit anyone's needs and there is still a good selection.  Service is great.  We've had the hibachi as well and it was very good.  Service was again great and Chef was very entertaining.  Steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and ordered the two special rolls and sushi combo. Ehhhhh is what I will say....me and wife both agreed that their rice sucked ass. It was kinda hard and had no flavor (I guess I've always had good sushi rice that I can tell when someone doesn't put any love in the rice).  The nigiri we ordered were small and if this is the portion size....it's a good thing we had lunch only. We will not be returning back here.....oh ya service sucked ass considering there were 2 servers and about 4 tables that were being served"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Really reasonable prices for bento box or regular lunch menus. Sashimi lunch under $10! Comes with rice and salad. Salad was a little soggy from too much dressing. Fish was fresh and yummy, but we were probably served escolar in lieu of white tuna as evidenced by my tummy's response a couple of hours after lunch. Ample seating and polite staff. Would return."}
{"text":"Best hibachi in town!! You must try it! It's better than Ohjah.  We had sushi and steak. Everything is great. Sashimi is very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Love the entertainment when you sit in the teppenyaki area. The chef and service is great! The prices for their sashimi are reasonable too. You get big portions. OH and don't forget to ask for the pickled wasabi aka fresh wasabi. It's so good."}
{"text":"Another great find in Las Vegas Bonsai Japanese Steak and Sushi what a fun experience without having to go to the strip right here in town. Excellent prices hibachi style dining everybody's wonderful Justin served us tonight just the friendliest guy a must-try if you're in the mood for sushi or hibachi style dining"}
{"text":"Had to come back to this place again.  The customer service here is hands down one of the best. The food here never disappoints. I've had 2 events here on the hibachi side now (aside from me dropping in on occasion for sushi) and it's because Derrick (the manager) makes sure your event is running smoothly. Whether it was an event for 50 or 6 he does it right. Bonsai's my Go To! Great food + great service= return customers like myself."}
{"text":"The Sashimi and sushi combo is a very good deal , food is very fresh and service is great !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times already and we love it! The food is amazing and fresh. My favorite place for hibachi has always been Ohjah, but this place is closer and more convenient and just as good in my opinion. Our dinner was great the first time and their sake selection is great. The 2nd time we sat at the bar and had some baked mussels and a couple of appetizers which were all great.   This recent 3rd visit, we sat in the dining room as we did not want to do the hibachi. It was very slow and there was only one other table besides us at 8:30. We had a new server, said he was still in training. He was very nice and had a personality. Some of the time, I felt he should've just kept comments to himself. He was not rude, but came off like a cocky popular high school jock. We noticed there were some menu errors which was kinda disappointing. We asked about the \"fried oysters\" as it said on the menu. The server did not know so he said he would find out for us. He came back to the table and told us they did not have fried oysters, only raw. I'm not crazy about raw oysters, so we decided to pass. I wanted to try the $45 sashimi/roll platter. The server said he could not tell us what was on it, it was chefs choice. That's fine and I understand they probably use what they have extra of or what is about to go bad before it actually does. But it would be kinda nice to have an idea of what we would be getting, but he said he has no idea. We decided to get an order of baked mussels(amazing) 2 orders of different kinds of tuna(amazing) and the salmon skin salad(amazing). We ordered 4 orders of salmon belly nigiri because we LOVE it. It did not disappoint, tasted super fresh. We had 2 different rolls that were both super great. One was the Odessa and I can't remember the other.   The restaurant started closing before we had our dessert. I work in the restaurant industry and definitely get closing early if there's no business. Helps save on labor, especially if it's been slow all day. I think they should increase their marketing to bring more people in. The food is amazing and super fresh. The staff is always really nice. I love the fact I can go in on a weekend evening and not have to wait, but when they start closing and cleaning before we've had dessert, it made me feel rushed and they wanted us out. Right as we got our dessert(free mochi upon check in with Yelp,) a family of 7 walked in for hibachi. Sorry guys, that sucks.    Overall, this place is a must! Whether you sit at the hibachi table, the bar counter, or in the dining room. Thanks guys for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"We started with Hot Green Tea and few starters like seaweed salad, baked muscles, shrimp tempura. Then we moved to 10pc sashimi which I think is great. Then went on to several nigiri and a hand roll.  The kitchen food is not even warm on the inside which I think mostly we're reheat process, the baked muscles were hot on the outside and so-so on the inside. The nigiri are so-so as I can't taste the fish. The rice is good enough to make two nigiri and imagine that being combined in 1 pc of nigiri... the handroll we ordered came to us as cut roll and they apologized because the sushi chef didn't know  what handroll is... apology accepted. They corrected it and made us a handroll. There was bit of delay and it's not even busy for a 7pm Sunday dining. The best is saved for last, Mochi ice cream! Can't go wrong right :) over all good not sure if I'd try this place again."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and hibachi place.  Service was good and place looks clean.  Price was reasonable.  Im happy that it is very close to my house.  Will definitely comeback."}
{"text":"You walk into the building and you're met with the light smell of fish and grills running. This was an instant appetite builder for me. The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly. He refilled our waters very quickly. My only comment is about filling out the paper: I don't prefer to fill out papers for AYCE, but I can see why it's necessary.  On to the food. It was good. The fish quality was pretty good but the rice was a bit cold and hard. They were also out of a lot of items during our visit. While that is no one's fault, it took away from the value of my visit.  Will visit again when they have more items, but not my favorite Vegas sushi spot."}
{"text":"You will not find better sushi in Las Vegas.  Service is average at best, but the food is amazing.  It would rate five stars if the wait staff were more professional and attentive.    My favorite choice is the Red Lobster Roll.  It is insane.  The restaurant often has two for one specials so you'll get your fill.  If this place were in a better location it would be packed every night."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the sushi or tempura they have always been good. As for that house salad, I could've gotten a better salad at the gas station. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Fresh fresh fresh!!!!! Moved here from redondo beach, ca and FINALLY found this!!!!    Just an update after many more visits!! Rick has been our server a couple Of times now and we love him!!!! Alice the manager is always smiling and so friendly! If you're looking for a new regular sushi spot look no further!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. Chef Jeff is hands down the best. All food is cooked to perfection. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat!!"}
{"text":"Great chef . Great food nice staff they even gave us free beers . Was fresh . Design was also very nice ."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick bite or stay for a while. I specifically love there Tuesday all day happy hour, we usually have 2/3 bottles of $18 Sake followed by $3 supporro, the food is really good everything on the happy hour is solid. My personal favorite the Salmon/Tuna Tar tat served on a Pringle chip (WHAAAAT) and the jelepeno yellowtail .. overall you get a good bang for your buck when you go for happy hour. Even if you don't it's still worth it.. good spot and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Lent Friday meal with the fiancé - no meat on Fridays. It was a pretty relaxing/casual experience overall.  We liked the wait staff for friendliness and efficiency. The food was good too, and we had Teriyaki Shrimp and Teriyaki Salmon, which came with a side of either miso soup or salad. The teriyaki came with sautéed green bell peppers, onions and steamed broccoli on a fajita plate. We also had the Las Vegas roll, which was more breaded than crunchy, but had decent flavor in it. Can't go wrong with mochi ice cream at the end of a meal either.  This is some place I'd go to if I were in the area. Fiancé says we should try this place out again once Lent is over and we can have cocktails with our meals, probably even try the Hibachi area with family/friends."}
{"text":"Our first time here. It was excellent. Our server Ric was awesome. He sat down to take the time explain the menu, very friendly, and attentive to our table. We highly recommend the Godzilla and Cowboy sushi :)"}
{"text":"Would I come back? Any trip to Vegas means going to a AYCE place. For this trip I decided that I wanted sushi instead of the usual casino buffet, so my friend recommended this place.   You are able to make reservations for this place so I thought it would be busy. When we got there, we were seated right away and there was maybe 3 other tables. Towards the other side of the restaurant, they have teppanyaki but only one party was there.  They have a wide selection of different items on the menu. When you order, they will bring out the appetizers first, followed by the sushi and rolls. The fish was fresh but the nigiri had soooo much rice in it. Coming from Southern California, the AYCE sushi places there know that if they want our business they need to put as little rice as possible.   Other than the gigantic amount of rice in the nigiri and our server messing up our drink orders, the experience was pleasant. A couple items that were great included: yellowtail with jalapeno, ono, salmon tataki, halibut, red snapper and veggie tempura.   The cost of dinner was $27 per person and they share a parking lot with multiple businesses. If you enjoy eating copious amounts of rice with your sushi then this place is for you. For me, I like my nigiri with little to no rice. I will pass on this place and make my way to other places when I am visiting Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times in total now and it gets better each time! Food is great especially for the price and customer service is always great! Vibe is nice with the hibachi in the back and the booths/bar up front. You can be in a quiet setting when desired too. We just had Richard as our server and he was great! We've had Heath and Adrian as well but everyone is always incredible! You have our business now!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Vegas, fine dining, great atmosphere and amazing service - the hibachi menu is a must - Enjoy"}
{"text":"The presentation of the sushi was really pretty and tasty. We got the cowboy And twice the odessa. Wish it was all you can eat. The shumai on the menu was steamed but I got them to fry it- much better. They have a hibachi section too. Waiter was super attentive. Sushi came out fast."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love coming here, we come around once a week. The sushi is AMAZING. And reasonable prices, which is why we come here so often. I love that they have sushi and hibachi, as my fiancé doesn't like fish. So we both have something we enjoy and can eat together. The few months we've been coming here, we've had decent service, nothing impressive. Except for the waitress who has served us the past few times, Erin, she's very sweet and always offers if we need anything additional. Other waiters would not even really speak. Thank you Erin (: Also, best part is they have an A for health inspection, which I LOVE."}
{"text":"Close to home so we wanted to give it a try. Ordered a couple rolls (no avocado), tamago and a beef bento box. They made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. I felt bad but I asked them for no avocado when I ordered because I'm allergic. Also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm.   Dined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. It was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. Ah, so weird. There must be something else you could be doing...  The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side. The waiters reached across and in between the two of us throughout the meal. Just may be inexperience. There wasn't any consistency in service either. Check took forever to get. There were a total of 6 guests in the whole restaurant.   Overall, the service was interesting. I'm no food expert but the food is okay and I left feeling uncomfortable and awkward. Oh, it's probably from the chef watching us eat the whole time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service reasonable prices and the hibachi gill chef was hilarious.  Had the ribeye and he cooked it to perfection!  Will definitely be back again with the rest of the crew to try the seafood and try the sushi bar.  They gave us a complimentary mango mochi ice cream. Good stuff. Be sure to come in whole all their new promotions are running!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST sushi place ive ever been. People BEWARE! These 5 and 4 stars comments are friends and families. Service was bad. Got AYCE sushi and the servers dont come to you until you raise your hand (which i find hilarious lol - cause you really gotta raise your hand to get their attention). It wasnt busy when i went. There was only 2 or 3 groups besides mine and still got different orders. Rice portion was too much, fish were dry, everything were just bland.  Service and food were bad so i didnt leave any tip. Then went home and saw a message on facebook from LUIS complaining about not getting any tips. (Do NOT pay with your card if you dont plan on leaving any tips due to their bad service... or they will track you down)."}
{"text":"Went here for my fiancé's birthday and we absolutely loved it! There was a bit of a wait because it was a super busy Friday night, but it honestly wasn't bad. We opted for the hibachi - they do offer AYCE MENU FOR LIKE $30, which we will try next time. But anyway.. the place was packed, but comfortable. Moving on to the important stuff. We did the hibachi, and got to kind of peek in on another table while we waited for ours to be ready and their hibachi chef was great and interactive and really put on a show. Ours however was a bore. I think they just got overly busy and needed to get chefs out so they had a chef from the back come out and he was not at all interactive or entertaining. the food was great though we all had chicken which was really tender and the rice, which you get a big bowl of and a generous helping of veggies. We also ordered sushi - the tiger and dragon roll I believe and it was AMAZING!! So so good! And beautifully presented. I gave 4 out of 5 simply because of the hibachi chef we got, but other than that it was great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a la carte lunch so this review does not include their hibachi and AYCE services. My wife had the bonsai pizza and i did the lunch special with spider roll and godzilla.  1. Bonsai Pizza - my comment would be... Interesting. Sashimi and tobiko on top of dough. It was ok but not something my wife and I would order again. 2. Spider roll - average. 3. Gozilla roll - average.  AYCE- i guess the price could be lower. We checked out their AYCE menu and nothing out of the ordinary. You're better off @ Yama sushi or Sakana for AYCE."}
{"text":"I decided to go into this place because it's close to my house and I have been to another one of their locations on like Flamingo & 215. The first thing I noticed when I came into the door was the hostess was on the phone and it was a personal phone call for sure. She did not say hi or welcome, or hang up the phone she continued her phone conversation and then sat us down. I have been a hostess before and I would never treat a guest that way. Hopefully the help wanted for servers and hostess in the window will bring in better employees. Next I find out that they only had one baked roll well the server said that at first and I asked him to please ask the chef if he can make me more baked rolls because I am not allowed to eat any raw ones right now I'm pregnant. Usually most places can make atleast a variety of 5 baked rolls. He came back and this was not the case. He said the sushi chef could only make one more baked roll. So only 2? Not cool. Their other location has a variety. Then I asked if their steak had a smaller portion then a 5 oz. He said no. He also informed me it wasn't part of the all you can eat. Even though I normally enjoy it, I could not eat on the tepon table at this time because I was with my toddler and it's unsafe for her. It's unfortunate this spot is close to my house and lacks customer service skills and doesn't have many options for me. Furthermore because of the bad customer service it May be the reason they only had one other customer when I went in. I went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service, we sit down at the hibachi, David was our chef, he made the kids laugh so hard, he cooked our ribeye and scallops perfect medium rare. The server Erin and Heath was very tentative, refilled our drinks, asked how's everything, also suggested us few appetizers, which yellowtail jalapeño and bonsai pizza was very delicious. We love their sushi and sashimi combo, great price, sashimi very fresh. Overall, we love this restaurant, for sure will be back soon."}
{"text":"Finally this place has opened. Ive been waiting for a long time for this place to open. The food is great and the place awesome. The bento box is a go to and really good. 5 star because this place is just awesome. Ill b3 coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this joint on a hungry evening with my cousin. We opted for teppanyaki and the food was great. The server had a bit of an attitude, but he adjusted it rather quickly so I'll let that pass. I work in the industry and I know everyone has their pet peeves about guest. He made up for it in the end, so we'll let that go. Our chef was great from start to finish. He was very attentive and adaptable to our personalities.  Tiger roll- amazing as it is my usual sushi order Shrimp and salmon teppanyaki entrees- we split this and the chef already knew that we were going to and have us even portions.  Allergies- my cousin is deathly allergic to mushrooms Ana I love them! Chef made sure to clean the grill well before he started cooking, cooked everything, and then my mushrooms last. Server also made sure there wasn't any mushrooms in her miso soup.   I will definitely have to come back again!"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice now and gotten food to go once and both times the food was decent. The first time i was dining in with my bf and he had the steak teriyaki lunch special. He said that it was really good and when I had a bite of his steak it was very tender and the flavor was decent. You could taste the steak instead of just tasting the teriyaki sauce at other places.  I was craving noodles and all they had were sauteed udon noodles. So I ordered it with steak as well... And it was delicious. So good in fact that I was craving it days later. Lol  Then the second time I got there lunch special and it was decent. Good amount of food for your buck... But nothing really stood out from the lunch special. But overall decent flavors.  Then the last time I went...I wanted the sauteed udon noodles... Yup...I was craving it again. Lol and like the first time... The meat was tender and the noodles were flavorful.   They also have fried rice ONLY as a side dish so you can't order it as an entree. The flavor and texture is good but Everytime I've gotten it... It's been a tad bit bland... But sprinkle on some soy sauce and it was perfect. I wish they would make a entree size fried rice.   Flavor (4/5)... For the most part.. Delicious. :)  Overall, Everytime I've been the ambiance has been clean and welcoming. Ambiance (5/5) The servers mostly have been good... The first time the server I had.... Had a tendency to shuffle her feet... Which after a while was annoying... But that's a little petty. Lol   Other then that I have no complaints. I'll be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the service was great.  The food presentation was unexpectedly elegant and the sushi portions were spot on.  No reason not to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food was so fresh and tasty. It's the best sushi place I've been in town. I'll repeat soon :)"}
{"text":"We have never been here before and decided to come here to celebrate my mom's birthday. We really enjoyed the food and had excellent services from Richard.   The place huge, they have a side for sushi and a side for teppanyaki. We were seated immediately, Richard came right over to take our drink orders and showed us the menu. First off, Richard was awesome! We was so friendly and joyful, took great care of us, he made jokes and seemed to really enjoy his job.   You also get a free meal here on either side of the restaurant if you come on your birthday! They play the Japanese drums and blast birthday music and sing to you. Very cool!   Food wise, the menu doesn't necessary have unique or different items compared to other places (appetizers wise), but what they do have are of quality. The fishes are fresh and sweet, rolls are delicious and creative. Their presentation for the rolls are also pretty nice. I was very impressed by their tempura, both the vegetable tempura and shrimp tempura. The batter on the vegetable tempura were very thin and so crunchy! The shrimp tempura are coated with panko instead of just batter, so very crispy and crunchy, shrimps were also very big too. The salmon skin salad was very good, similar to seaweed salad with crispy salmon skin and other veggies. The salmon skin roll was good too, very crunchy...I don't know of another place that has salmon skin roll like this.   My grandma does not eat sushi so we ordered stir-fried udon which she loved! This is a statement because my grandma is very picky with food and she does not like to eat out, but she said she would come back for the udon! Huge portion too...the plate was bigger than her.   Overall, I really like this place. Not a place to come to if you are looking for unique appetizers or a large appetizes menu, but if you want quality sushi give this place a try."}
{"text":"The best of both worlds - AYCE and teppanyaki! Bonsai has teppanyaki seating in the back with the regular restaurant/sushi bar in front.  Since they've opened, we've been here a number of times. Food and service are always good, and there usually isn't a wait to be seated.  My hubby usually gets the All You Can Eat sushi (around $27?) but I like the teppanyaki dinner, so we sit on the restaurant side and I order the Hibachi dinner (which is basically the same teppanyaki dinner, just not sitting at the cooktop table).  Compared to similar AYCE and teppanyaki places, prices are comparable. They're located just down the street so the convenience is also a plus for me!"}
{"text":"I always drove by this place and didn't think much of it, but finally stopped by to have dinner with my girlfriend and her parents. This place was a good choice!!! I was starving after the gym, so you know I was ready to grind! We were greeted immediately and got seated right away. I didn't get our server's name, but he was great! He got us our waters right away and kept making sure we were doing fine and asked if we had any questions. We ordered 3 Teri chicken bentos and 1 udon. It was about $9 bucks I think for the udon (correct me if I'm wrong) and $15.95 per bento. BOIII you get a good portion here! The bento comes with rice, salad, miso soup, tempura veggies, choice of meat, and California rolls. We were super stuffed and even had to take the California rolls home. The food tasted great and we all enjoyed our meals. I would be back again because I see that they give a good meal for the price you pay. Excited to try some of their sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"I was really let down by this place, especially with all the good reviews.  The food here is pretty bad - I got a bento box with teriyaki salmon, California roll, shumai, and vegetable tempura. My boyfriend got combo chicken and steak teriyaki. We also got two orders of gyoza - our favorite. It came with salad and miso soup.  The salmon teriyaki was very good, along with the tempura and miso soup. My boyfriend couldn't even eat his meat, he said the meat wasn't good. His dad said the salad dressing tasted really weird. The shumai was disgusting, I had to spit it out. The gyoza was super disappointing - the filling was really strange and untraditional, with a bad taste, and the outside while it looked crispy was very mushy. The California roll was weird - it wasn't traditional at all, I think it was imitation crab mixed with cream cheese with a little piece of celery. The rice was also undercooked and had a weird taste, how do you mess up rice?  We didn't eat most of the food and no one enjoyed it. And for the record, we are not picky eaters in the slightest. I wouldn't be back or recommend. Sad, our expectations were much higher."}
{"text":"This place is newer and I hate trying new places because I want them to experiment on others first but such a good experience! The manager Alice and our waiter Ric couldn't be lovelier. The food was really good. My fav was the tuna tartare with baked crispy baguette and a lemony zesty dressing that made us want to lick the bowl."}
{"text":"Came here after a nice gym sesh felt bad I didn't know the close at 11 got here at 10:30 on a Thursday, we walked in still greeted with a smile. We were seated by Heath and he was also our server. He was very personable and funny great service btw. For a group of servers we know when someone is faking but heath was genuinely nice. Got the bento box $15.95, Japanese lasagna roll $7.57 and the sushi beginner $9. Great price points great quality sushi. The ambiance is cool and hip. Will definitely be back.  Oh and they have hibachi/ teppanyaki the next dining room over. Overall great place and decor is pretty dope btw"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi, hibachi, or bento boxes! They have an amazing Teriyaki Salmon which you can even get for less than $10 during lunch time! If you have never been please give them a try. I love their food so much and they always do their best. The only problem is they don't get a lot of business. I fear that they won't always be there if people don't start noticing how great they are!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Bonsai. Staff was wonderful! Quality ingredients, great sushi! I will be back.... Often!"}
{"text":"Great place and service. Delicious food and plating. First round of beer is free. Mango chicken Salad was light and flavorful. Highly recommend spicy yellowtail roll absolutely delish."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start off by saying, the receptionist was nice. We were seated almost immediately. Me, my brother and parents all ordered the bento box which is almost $16. I ordered chicken with mine and when we got our food, portions were very small. Very dissapointing. I regret going here and should've chose kabuki instead. Place is loud as well, so good luck trying to have a conversation. Waitress barely checked on us to make sure everything was okay. Didn't receive any refills. They took awhile to finally get us our bill, sat around for maybe 15mins waiting. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Maybe people come here for the AYCE but I didn't come for that."}
{"text":"The Goods  1. Teppan yaki good for long dinner and show 2. Rock shrimp was yummy 3. I like the bento boxes for a mix   Service 1. Good, was quiet at lunch hour  2. CC and cash ok 3. Adequate parking   Ambiance 1. Open and clean  MoJo 1. Wanting to go for the teppan yaki, haven't had in a long time"}
{"text":"It is now 8:42pm and we are just about done with their AYCE Sushi and as full as we are we don't want to leave!  Their AYCE is absolutely high quality and if you're an avocado aficionado you'll appreciate their avocado and more!  It melts in your mouth!  We've been to town of AYCE Sushi restaurants between here and LA and this place by far is the best!  Their AYCE selections are generous unlike other places which only serve certain items/ rolls just for their AYCE menu.  The kicker on top of all the deliciousness was our server, Rick!   He's the only Rick their and may we highly recommend asking for Rick!   He's knowledgeable but the icing on the cake was his hospitality and the friendship he extended out to us!  If you want an entirely wonderful and pleasant and/ or romantic experience, ask for him!  Thank you so much Rick for your hospitality and warmth!  Thank you Vince (manager), for also being awesome!  We are now loyal customers of Bonsai Japanese Steak & Sushi!!!"}
{"text":"First time tried the sushi bar. Food was amazing, decor was beautiful on our sushi & sashimi boat. My husband enjoy the super white tuna, and I love the Boston Shrimp sashimi, they fried the head for us. Our chef Bobby was super friendly, and server Heath gave us many good suggestion, very informative.  Restaurant is very modern design. Food are fresh great for the price. We would for sure come back again.  Glad they finally open."}
{"text":"We came here by mistake and the all you can eat sushi is sooo good! The fried rice is amazing and the sushi and food very fresh! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service plus free mochi if you check in on Facebook! Already have been 3 times and plan on going back for lunch at least once a week :)"}
{"text":"Service is decent and people are friendly but the sushi is terrible. If you're going for good quality sushi then this is not the place. Too be honest, most AYCE places do not serve high quality fish, so that's my fault. My food also took a very long time, rest of the family who didn't order AYCE was already finished by the time I got my first order of sushi. Next, the staff sat a completely belligerent and very drunk guy next to us, then sat some very angry teens on the other side of us whose every other word was the f word. The restaurant was empty so seating us in between these two groups of individuals made the whole experience so much worse than it should have been. Based on food alone we would have tried again but based on the type of people who come here, we just can't risk it. Also, we walked into a cloud of cigarette smoke the manager was smoking right outside the restaurant doors. Maybe your experience will be different but we will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Las Vegas and the staff (Candice) made our first time there for dinner last night incredible!  Have you ever woken up thinking about sushi? You will after visiting Soho!  The yellow tail was amazing, the tapas (yup, tapas) insanely creative, the trout with pop rocks (what?) a \"must try gift\" from Candice was so delicious! AND it all comes at once and so beautifully presented.  Sigh...We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. After a few months the quality of the fish has really dropped. As I noticed a lot of sushi spots start off really caring about quality, but over time they can't stand losing money by keeping only fresh fish in & tossing the old. This place is a good example, either the owners/managers are letting poor quality fish go out or the chef is.     Service has always been a 2 star at best. Never been a fan of any of the waitresses or the waiter. Pretty rude. Don't ask them for any recommendations, it's such a big hassle for them to do their job and know the menu. They have no clue on how to help you order what your looking for. They just tell you that you can read the whole f*n menu then order when your ready. This is mainly the older male waiter at this place, no help at all with the menu. But we have had this same issue with the waitress as well.    The restaurant is very bright inside, not a very comfortable setting at all. Mixed with poor service and bad quality fish. Only the tasteless foodies will enjoy the Americanized cream cheese filled, deep fried, mayo based fake sushi this place has. It's really insulting how these places make sushi with all these fat flllers and disgusting when I see people eating it. When did sushi become a deep fried cheese burger sub beef for fish?     Anyways,  If your looking for real sushi & good service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am so glad when they open a Hibachi/ Sushi place in this neighborhood. No need to drive far for dinner entertainment with the family. It's located next to Kung Fu Tea, intersection of Rainbow and Warm Spring. It was behind the Metro Diner so don't miss it. Plenty of parking spaces around.   Heath was our server and two thumbs up for him for his great service. He was very thorough taking our drinks order (8 of us, 8 different drinks!). The lemon for the water had a weird taste, so he changed it right away for us. He provided us with a tentative, friendly, quick and an effective service.   It's a pretty big restaurant where they can accomodate up to 135 people inside. They three sections: hibachi sections, sushi bar or regular dining tables. The place is clean and well maintained.   No sushi tonight, we had Hibachi instead. Love the creativity the hibachi Chef. He made dinner so fun for the kids and our whole crew. Who would not love to eat  Erupted Volcanoes Onion, Dissapeared Jumping Eggs or Choo choo train made of Onion?    Here is the recap of our dinner tonight: - Appetizer: Yellowtail Hamachi with special yuzu sauce, a hint of sriracha and topped with jalapeno. Fresh and spicy! Yumm. A must try.   - Entrees: Hibachi It comes with soup (clean broth miso with seaweed) and salad (iceberg with ginger sauce)  For the meat we chose: Lobster tail, Salmon, Chicken and Fillet Mignon. Love the lobster tail, salmon and fillet mignon, they were fresh and cooked perfectly. The chicken was overcooked. Dry and hard to chew.  Hibachi also comes with mixed veggies: mushroom, onion, broccoli and zucchini.  Additionally, hibachi comes with fried rice (cooked at the hibachi table according to your taste). As option, you may also add shrimp or other meat to the rice. The fried rice was tasty.   - Desert: vanilla mochi and green tea ice cream. Perfect.   Would have give this place a 5 stars if the chicken was cooked perfectly. But overall, we had a great dinner entertainment and I prefer their food than Benihana, especially when their price is better. Would come back again, possibly for Happy Hour (I saw they have great variety of Happy Hour Menu)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. We were here to celebrate a birthday and they treated us like royalty. She had so much fun. Delicious food and a lot of variety on the menu. Only downside is that they don't have a child's menu for hibachi. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A few people had recommended this place for me to check out because they love it. I however did not have the same experience as them when we went for lunch one day. We came in, a group of 7 of us for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was us and one other table of people in the whole place. It took a very long time for them to get us our drinks and to get our orders. We all ordered something, most of us had done the ayce sushi and we sat and waited. Little by little one person would get one thing. It took a good 20 minutes before I even got anything from my order when most of the rest of my group had received 2-3 things each from theirs. It wasn't busy at ALL so there is no reason that our service should've been this bad. I didn't even bother ordering anything else after my first order because I was tired of waiting for my food and just wanted to leave. I also didn't want to be the only person eating since everybody else already finished. I don't feel I even got my money's worth with my experience here. They had a few good things that I tried from my friends orders since they were actually receiving their food, but I wasn't super impressed with the few things I got when I finally got them. I also don't like the fact that they don't tell you right from the beginning about the large gratuity they add for bigger parties. They waited until they were passing out all of our checks to \"by the way\" tell us."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing ~ the food, service, atmosphere. The hibachi show was the best we have ever seen and We love hibachi!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Staff was very welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Teppinyaki Chef was an awesome funny individual. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Service was good but the sushi grade was pretty bad. The fish was not fresh up to the point where it was a little chewy and has that fishy smell. I wouldn't go here again. The inside decor was nice and the server was friendly however."}
{"text":"What an awesome staff!!! This place had a very welcoming vibe and the manager was so friendly. The customer service here is outstanding!  We came for my sons birthday and it was late because we were originally going to go to another Japanese Steakhouse but they turned us down since they didn't have enough staff to open another table so we left. I'm so glad to found Bonsai. Sometimes that's how the world works when one door closes another one opens. The staff brought out the drums and sang my son happy Birthday which was so cool!   The restaurant was so cool to enter! They had an elegant but chill decor! The sushi bar was well employed with sushi chefs and they have more than enough tables.  The hibachi area was superb! It was typical like all Japanese Steakhouse and had a good amount space between each table. It didn't feel like you were all up in other people's dining area.   The food was awesome! I ordered the Rib Eye and Shrimp. My son had the fried noodles and my wife had the New York steak! Our chef cooked it to perfection! Nice and juicy! Meat was very well flavored and the fried rice/vegetables was awesome!   They offer happy hour specials so we had a pint of Sapporo and had their fried oysters! The fried oysters was bomb diggity! Make sure you guys try it out! I highly recommend it.  Our chef as nice and did the normal tricks like the volcano but other than that didn't do any new tricks. Perhaps I've seen them all but it's always good to see new styles when I come to Japanese steakhouses.   One difference they didn't have was a plate that had combination of meat. You order a main dish and then if you want to add additional meats or items it's additional cost. It still comes out pretty competitive in prices but I enjoy seeing an option for a plate with more than 1 item.   They have a large menu which is great!  I will definitely make my way back here!"}
{"text":"Good quality fish with friendly service.  It beats the other neighborhood Sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Love the attentive service. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I came here for valentines day and this is perfect  not only for a romantic date, but for casual dates, family dinners/lunches, and so on. Customer service was good and the menu choices were perfect. The sashimi plate with the ice sculpture along with the special rolls that come with it were the highlights of my experience. I look forward to doing the hibachi next time."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now. Haven't had their hibachi yet, but we have enjoyed the food from the regular table and menu so far. I love how they decorate the sushi platters with little bonsai trees. So fitting.   All sushi, sashimi, and cooked fish here are all fresh. No pungent fishy taste. Their sake Kama and hamachi Kama prices are very decent. Their lunch bento prices are great for the high quality food.   My daughter loves their shrimp tempura. Only a few pieces for almost $6, but the shrimps they use are thick and large. My mom ordered their lunch special from the hibachi, and she said it was great and tasty.  Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing food and entertaining chef.  Definitely go for the hibachi!  Also, I caught the shrimp in my mouth on the first try!"}
{"text":"The best place I have ever tasted they have great service. Food OMG I cant explain it. I'm definately coming back. Amazing amazing amazing. Thank you for making my belly happy"}
{"text":"The service was really good, ric was very attentive and helpful when it came down to helping us order food. We got the hibachi ribeye steak and the side of lobster and the food was enough for two people. Also the environment is really nice and calming. Most definitely will be coming back for their lunch hour. Prices were pretty good for the prices you pay too so no complains there"}
{"text":"Pretty good but nothing special, the staff was nice but I was not overly impressed with the chicken hibachi and the fried noodles were not seasoned at all and had no flavor."}
{"text":"Dayum!!!! This place is soooooo dang good!!!!!! I can't say enough about how impressed I was with the food. We ordered the live oysters, soft shell crab, and hibachi (lobster, chicken, and shrimp among my family) and everything was incredible. The live oysters were my absolute favorite!!! I ordered half a dozen at first, and after tasting them I ordered half a dozen more! They come with tobiko and green onions on top (and some mixture of sauces and oil) which totally set them off to a whole new level of tastiness. I mean guys, if you like raw oysters, you have to try this place! They come from Washington too (so I was told).   As for the hibachi, everything was cooked incredibly well and seasoned to perfection. I loved my meal and the chef was funny and entertaining!   The soft shell crab was a tasty appetizer too! Very crispy and juicy. I could've died right there eating it!  My new favorite place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came to this place to check out what was new around my area. This place is classy and inexpensive. David was our cook, he was amazing! David made the whole table laugh and his skills were quite entertaining and fun to watch. He even pulled a trick on me! Needless to say, he definitely made us feel relaxed. The food was amazing as well. But overall, this place is worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Good music. Good food. Good staff. Yellowtail appetizer is amazing and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Best rolls ever!!!  Try bonsai pizza!!! Incredible!!!  Five star place, probably my favorite sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I always give places a second chance because you never know if the first was a fluke or not. My boyfriend and I decided to try Bonsai since we drive by quite often.   The first experience was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, our orders had come at a timely manner and the food tasted really good. My boyfriend had the ayce sushi and was mentioning how this place would be our go to sushi. He mentioned how fresh the fish tasted and how quick we got our sushi. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo bento which came with soup, salad, vegetable tempura, shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, and California roll. The salmon teriyaki was delicious. I wanted more! Our bill was around $50-$60, but it was worth it and decided we would come again.   Today, Our experience was less than great. We had come around dinner time, but there was only two other booths taken. We sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink. I don't remember our waitress' name, but we wished we had the male waiter instead. We had asked for waters with lemon. She came out with just water, and then gave us the menus and a paper ayce menu. She was about to just take the paper menu and leave, but I had to mention that I wanted to order off the regular menu. I told her my order and I had to repeat myself and point to the menu since she didn't understand \"snow crab\". I then asked for lemon for our water and then she left. Few minutes go by and she tends to the other tables, 5 more minutes go by and wave her down and ask for slices of lemon. She looks as if she understands by smiling and nodding and then leaves. 5 minutes go by and I get agitated since I have asked 3 times for lemon. My boyfriend and I see the male waiter and when we asked for lemon, he came back very quickly. I noticed he was tending to other tables that started coming as well.   A few minutes go by and my salmon teriyaki comes with the rice. It was flavorless. I didn't order the combo this time and was just expecting salmon, rice, and a salad. No salad came and the teriyaki sauce was sunken to the bottom of the salmon. My boyfriend made a comment saying I was suppose to get a salad. The waitress seemed surprised and asked if I wanted a salad. When I said yes, she left quickly and I didn't have time to ask for extra teriyaki sauce.   30-40 minutes probably went by since being seated and my boyfriend didn't even get his sushi. We watched other tables getting their orders before us and even leaving before us! When his order finally came, his appetite was gone. We had enough of waiting and was just annoyed with out service.   Overall, we give this place a 1 out of 5 stars. We had to ask 4 different times for lemon for our water and waited around 30-40 minutes for our food even though there was hardly anyone there.   My boyfriend noticed that on the ayce paper menu it doesn't have a time limit like other sushi places. We concluded that if there was a time limit, then there wouldn't be any time left to order a second time.   We are highly disappointed. I came home and started eating some apples to satisfy myself."}
{"text":"It was an amazing dining experience here! I tried their lunch special once to-go and it was delicious! Their 2-Special Roll is a genius marketing idea by the way! So I came back as a Birthday treat to myself to dine-in and I was impressed with their plating presentation and freshness. I have yet to try that Hibachi grill though! However, in that same week I brought my whole family (party of 22) in for a Birthday Celebration for my Mom and they still did not disappoint. They were very professional, courteous and respectful of our celebration. Thank you so much Bonsai for a great time! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here almost once a week for the past month or so. Great food & service. Their busy times are around 530-730 so you may have to wait if you come at those times. But it's worth the wait. He filet is very tender and has lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Went here for my uncles birthday party two weeks ago and had a great time. We had a party of about 40 people that sat around 4 of the grills and their service was excellent.  Chefs were very entertaining and fun to watch and talk to and food tasted great. I've been to other hibachi restaurants and think the chefs at this place put on a better show and experience and for a reasonble price."}
{"text":"Great local sushi and hibachi restaurant!  I live right by this place.  I've been here a few times and food is good along with friendly service!"}
{"text":"Bonsai has amazing customer service and staff! We came in at 10:06pm thinking that they would be open but their actual close time on Sundays is 10pm. The hostess was so accommodating and still took our order even though they were already closed. After receiving the sushi, we were not disappointed by the flavor. Awesome sushi spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best new sushi places in town! Not only is the quality of sushi awesome, but the prices are great. Huge selection of rolls, appetizers, and anything else you would want. The lunch specials are amazing and are available 7 days a week. I got the \"Two special roll\" lunch and the Sizzling Love Roll was so yummy! The restaurant has a very cool, modern feel and everyone who works there is friendly and accommodating. We have already been twice this week! Will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice service . This is one of my favorite Japanese food with hibachi restaurant in Las Vegas. I will recommend it to everyone who is visiting here."}
{"text":"Another new joint in the south Rainbow area.  Had Teriyaki beef for lunch.  Decent food, clean, nice atmosphere.  Teller of Penn & Teller walked in by himself to have lunch.  Love to come back for dinner and try the sushi. Southwest area neighborhood is getting lots of food choices.  Out of town visitors need to venture outside the strip."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and price was reasonable.  I highly recommend \"Sai\" as the cook.  And \"Vincent\" as the waiter/host. He knows the food very well!:) Great help !!! I totally find thos place by accident.  Just waited atl the light on Warm Springs and E Rainbow.  Heading toward Jones. My 5 yr old and I was going to go to hack in the box and decided to do Hibachi instead!! We are so thrilled we did too!! Definitely will be back! Would be nice to have combo selections though.  But you can get on the side;)"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has the worst sushi I have ever had.....short staff, fish not fresh, rice was too hard"}
{"text":"Come during happy hour! Our server was really nice and gave a great suggestion.   Do not miss the yellowtail jalapeño.   Do a review and get a mochi.   We spent $40 on the happy hour menu and left full."}
{"text":"Food was about what I expected. Music was inappropriate for kids (rap with lot of n-word and cursing). Also we came for hibachi at lunch on a weekend and were told when we arrived that they don't turn them on until 3pm. If I had known that we would have gone somewhere else bc we told my kids it was a hibachi place and they were pretty bummed."}
{"text":"AYCE is good and includes Sashimi. Pretty good for $27. Fish is fresh and well-made. Great lunch specials and a good way to try this new place out.  Nice atmosphere, pleasant servers. I hope it stays this way."}
{"text":"Finally tried their hibachi. Reasonably priced and I think you get bigger portions than Ohjah! Also what made it so great was the chef Thristian, dude is funny as hell and also considerate about everyone's needs.  He's a lot more interactive and social than most chefs. He also suggested my bf get his steak medium well instead of well because he didn't want to serve anyone rubber and turned out he was right ( I like a medium to medium rare myself) someone from our table bought him a beer since he was doing so awesome. also our server was on point and sushi was tasty. Definitely recommend him if you go!"}
{"text":"We are usually regulars at Sushimon for AYCE and are really big sushi lovers. We have traveled to Japan and had the best sushi. We decided to try this place out for my husbands birthday since they offered a free AYCE on your birthday. I was really surprised since other reviews seemed to make this place seem hit or miss. The quality of the fish was very fresh. They had some of the freshest tuna I have tasted in America. The presentation of the dishes served was something you don't typically get at an AYCE place but they were so nice, they seemed like a la carte orders. The rice to fish ratio also seemed a la carte. The slice of fish was way longer than the rice and the cut rolls and hand rolls had very little rice. My husband is picky about rice which can make or break a place for him. He said the rice was perfect for our orders but then became dry and hard near the end of our meal. It's ok because I was still so impressed with the flavors and freshness of the fish, the presentation, the quality. We loved it. Overall, I am really happy to stumble upon this place and it is closer to my house. We will definitely be back. We didn't even make it to the mochi which is very unusual as I always save room for dessert."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'd rather give a 2 1/2 star rating. We stopped in based on the 4 1/2 star overall rating. Went for lunch and ordered the hibachi lunch special. I can say I left with my hunger satisfied but felt that I'd be ready to eat again in a matter of a couple of hours. With this meal we got about 6 pieces of steak each. I cut each piece in half or thirds just to stretch the meat further. Flavor was ok. I didn't like the dressing they used on the salad at all. It tasted almost like plain mayonnaise. Maybe I'd give this place 3 stars if I had liked the salad dressing and if it came with miso soup. But even with that I wouldn't visit again since there are so many other great restaurants to choose from in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Ohjah much better. Pricing way too high, service way too slow. Sitting down at 8:30 and not being served until almost 11 because a chef \"called out\" is B.S. Not at all worth the price you pay. Explore other options."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Las Vegas for Sashimi!  So fresh."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was friendly, Derrick was our server he was great along with the chef. We totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here last night to check it out and had an overall pretty good experience, they've only been open a week so they definitely have a few kinks to sort out.  We arrived around 830 and wanted to do hibachi.  They sat us at a table but then asked us to move because part of the metal on the table was coming up.    We ordered a spicy salmon role and both got filet hibachi.    Our server informed us that they have a few specials: 2 sushi rolls for $16.95 and the first house sake, wine, or beer are on them!  Great perks!  We also noticed they have hibachi lunch specials for only $8.95, how great!   The food was excellent.  The steak had great flavor and the salmon had such a fresh taste in the roll.  We definitely had some lapses in service.  We had to ask for chopsticks for our sushi and meals, kind of strange but overall we had an excellent experience!  Our server, Kim, was very friendly and accommodating!    I look forward to dining here again"}
{"text":"This is the worst AYCE Sushi I've ever had. The rice to sushi ratio is outrageous. The rice is almost bigger than the fish. I can't even taste the fish because of the rice.  Also it took over 30 minutes to get our order of sushi. Not the greatest place to eat sushi. Also the sushi was not very fresh. The server did a decent job but was not happy with the food."}
{"text":"We tried the hibachi and loved it thoroughly ! \"Juan Martinez\" was awesome ! The best chef we've seen by far ! He does a great FIRE show !  His food was tasty as well and he was concerned to ensure he cooks your food right and you enjoyed the taste !  Will definitely be back !  Mgr Derek is awesome as well ! Friendly. courteous and helpful !"}
{"text":"I've tried both their teppanyaki and their AYCE sushi. The teppanyaki was just ok to me. The sauce they used for their teppanyaki is a bit too sweet. I tried both rib eye and chicken and the rib eye was quite dry. The fried rice that they made was not as good as other teppanyaki places, so that pretty much killed it for me. If a teppanyaki place can't make a good fried rice, then it's a fail in my book! The mushroom soup that came with the teppanyaki was also too peppery. The salad was good and fresh. The show that they did was cute.  Their AYCE sushi is definitely better than their teppanyaki. All the fish I had here tasted pretty fresh and I like that they offer some sashimi options with the AYCE. I don't really go for sushi rolls, so I didn't try those. The appetizers are either hits or misses. Overall, I still prefer yama as my AYCE place.  If you do want to try this place out, I say go for the sushi option."}
{"text":"They have delicious sushi, great prices and deals, and their steak is really good!!! But our server took forever to get to us and my boyfriends order of steak wasn't cooked all the way. Other than that, amazing food and it was so good to where I will definitely be coming back. Hopefully we have better service from the staff though. Our server barely checked on us and it wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"Service was bad. Our server didn't come back and refill our water, ask if we wanted boxes and they also ran out of udon and green tea mochi."}
{"text":"What a great first time experience!! Of course I did AYCE sushi!! I did like the pink lover and the shrimp tempura were huge!! Our waiter Derrick was great!!"}
{"text":"My side of town gets better and better! I was excited to know we had another sushi place up! The best part of this place, it's next to Kung Fu Tea. So if you're craving sone boba after you won't have to worry.    Food: I felt like their portion and quality of food is great at this location. They have a good sushi deal. 2 special rolls for $16.95. Check in on Yelp for a free mochi ice cream. I believe they also have a lunch special!   Service: Everyone has always been nice and welcoming at this location. Even the host. I sometimes call to order a pick up and i'm always well taken care of. My napkin, chopsticks, spoon and extra sauce is all ready. Not like some place and expects you to eat with your hands and no napkins. Smh.  To sum it up, check this location and give it a try."}
{"text":"Nothing I ate here really stuck out to me but it was a decent place to go to. Not too loud environment, nice staff, and overall pretty modern and clean.   I recommend that you come in during happy hour so you can get deals on some drinks and rolls. And be sure to check in on yelp so that you can get your free mochi dessert!"}
{"text":"This place embodies what someone would consider a high quality Japanese steak house. The service here is impeccable Erin was just unbelievably attentive. The product is of very high quality and they do not skimp out on their portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything was great food Ms service giving 4 for that, my only problem I have is that every time I come here they never have otoro or chutoro"}
{"text":"I come for lunch all the time because I work next door at Tutoring Club. They have a teriyaki lunch special which is delicious. It comes with a soup or salad and it's under $8 after tax. It's delicious and cheap. They only have a lunch special for two special sushi rolls for $14.95 that's comes with a soup or salad. My favorite rolls are the Godzilla, tiger, volcano, and crunch roll."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great, they started AYCE and it's good quality however not all rolls are included on their AYCE menu which is a drag. Also the time it took to get the order was way too long, we sat there for almost 2 hours on a relatively slow night. The server was apologetic but still, it was pretty ridiculous. I doubt I'll go back or recommend this place to friends. I wouldn't want them to blame me for so much lost time waiting for fish"}
{"text":"This place is so good I went 2 nights in a row! Food is delicious & awesome service both nights. Highly recommend. We didn't experience the hibachi table but did order the ribeye from hibachi the first night & filet the second night with a side of shrimp both nights. We also got 2 rolls for $19.95 & buy 1 get 1 beer both nights. Isn't overpriced. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Read reviews decided to give it a try. I'll break down... Service/friendliness 5 stars Atmosphere/cleanliness: 4 stars very clean, atmosphere was simplistic, a little cold. But it's the food that drops the rating for us. We shared a bento box to give it a try as you could experience several items for about $17 out the door.  It was a lot of food.  The miso soup was excellent.  The salad was nothing more than a bowl of iceberg lettuce thoughtlessly cut up with a flavorless odd textured dressing. The chicken teriyaki was prepared well but it was served on bed of sautéed onions and sliced green (peppers?) that impacted the flavor of the teriyaki, spoiling it.  There were 2 Shumai pieces that tasted more like deep fried puffs of air. We were told the tempura was comprised of shrimp and  veggies.  There was no shrimp. The rest was prepared okay but the dipping sauce was bland and almost had a burnt taste to it.  That ruined the tempura.  It also come with a California roll.  I love sushi and in my view a California roll is about as basic as it gets, so if that's not good, I wouldn't venture further.  It was not very good, neither of us could figure out where the strange sour taste was coming from, but it permeated the flavor of the roll.   In conclusion, it's not bad food, it's passable, but definitely not great. We would not go back based on that experience. There are just better places, we had high hopes as its close to home, but we'd drive further for great food.  It seems like they are trying too hard to be chic or different instead of just serving great tasting food. It pains me to say that as they are so nice. We really wanted it to be great, but it just wasn't.  :("}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice.  The hibachi meals are the best I've had anywhere in Las Vegas.  The steaks and seafood much better than other hibachi restaurants in Vegas.  Quality unbelievable.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi & sushimi that I've had in Las Vegas! The presentation was so beautifully arranged made you just want to look at it! The Odessa and Godzilla was excitement to the palate! Victoria was an excellent waitress with excellent recommendations! This will be our new place to enjoy sushi!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good presentation. Good prices & custome services.  Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Made to order sushi table side. Order taken immediatley after items selected. Richard very helpful with our meal. Great spacious dining area for casual eaters."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! The food was delicious. Sushi is fresh and presented beautifully. And the service  was amazing! Everyone is so friendly and provide great customer service. This will definitely be our new sushi spot. LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"Food and service was definitely great! Hibachi chef was awesome as well! Definitely recommend and will come back"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. My brother in law wanted the hibachi table, so we tried it out. Started well, soup was very tasty and the salad was okay; nothing overly flavorful for the dressing. Salad was a bit over cold. My sister did not like the veggies, but the rest of us found nothing wrong or overly special with them. Fried rice was also okay, nothing overly bad or especially tasty. My husband had chicken and ribeye as entree, sis had chicken and her husband paired up shrimp and chicken. I had scallops, big mistake. Scallops were horribly overcooked, very dry, flavorless and tough. I am suspicious that it was really scallop, but some type of whitefish. Hubby was happy with his ribeye, but it too was overcooked. Chicken was okay, shrimp overcooked as well. Our conclusion overall was that there are several other places like this in the area that do a better job."}
{"text":"Great job team bonsai, you guys made my birthday memorable to my family,specially thanks to Matt our server tonight, the filet mignon, and New York steak was cook well...overall fantastic job....dinner and a show"}
{"text":"Been here about three times and the food is always delicious. We love the Hibachi. Chefs are fun and entertaining. Of the times my kids and I have been here, we've ordered the Hibachi ribeye steak, NY steak, scallops, salmon, chicken, and Godzilla rolls, salmon nigiri, salmon sashimi, and cali roll. It was all very tasty. Only recommendation I would give to fellow diners is GET THE RIBEYE....dont waste your money by \"saving\" money getting the NY steak. It is much tougher than the ribeye (obviously cause different cuts). Trust me, I won't be getting the NY again. Bland and tough to chew (even at med rare).  Service was a little wishy washy the first 2 times. First time, our server hardly checked on us. We asked to have waters refilled. Second time, the server took our order, delivered our order, and gave us our check when we asked for it (was NOT busy, it was rather dead in there). Third time we were there service was flawless. Hence, one lower star for the service.  All in all, the family and I will be back for the food. Its delicious! Fave is Godzilla!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Presentation excellent. Will be back. Sushi rolls were tasty.  Had a Sapporo beer and desert too. Great looking place."}
{"text":"This review is for the Hibachi cooked in the kitchen without the \"show\". I'm not impressed at all. Way too saucy and salty! Fried rice was drenched in butter. Felt like I might have a heart attack after. Oh my! I guess some people like that but this was just way too much. Service was good but if food isn't good enough I won't be back, unfortunately. I might be willing to try their sushi though."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, great presentation and atmosphere.  Literally cannot express enough how splendid dinner was!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Bonsai Sushi Rocks! This place is brand new and the quality is great! The service is awesome and they have Lagunitas IPA, unfortunately not part of their Happy Hour however they now offer an All You Can Eat Menu with some Sashimi options which not alot of AYCE places offer and it's all the same quality as they're A LA Carte! I've enjoyed everything here from the Fried Rice, to the Oysters, and the Uni all has been Delicious."}
{"text":"Lunch Sashimi & Teppan specials even on weekends! And wines by the glass $6! Fresh and service is nice."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for dinner last week on Mother's Day. My parents both ordered the hibachi (mom got the salmon, dad got the steak). The hibachi comes with soup, salad, sautéed veggies, fried rice and the main meat. Portions were ample, and all of it tasted pretty good.  I got the tiger and cowboy rolls, and the dumplings but they were just okay. Would not recommend.  Four stars because prices were awesome ($80 including tip), the service was great and they gave all the diners (mom's) a carnation and a $10 coupon at the end of the meal for Mother's Day... a very thoughtful gesture."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after watching a disastrous show on the strip.   It was almost closing time so the place was practically empty.   Ordered ribeye (2), salmon skin roll and sashimi.   Loved the ribeye!   Service was excellent.  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was delicious.  The salad was very watery though.  But it was complimentary so doesn't count lol"}
{"text":"Was craving some late night sushi and wanted to try something new. My original intention was to come here for HH but ended up getting the AYCE because the items included in it were sooo good!!! And so worth the price paid! AYCE for dinner was app. $27, lunch is $24. What's unique about this place is they include a 10pc sashimi platter in their AYCE and there is no limit on that!! Def something I haven't seen at other sushi places. The fish was super fresh, a lot of options for ppl trying to stay away from rice, and they had a lot of non sushi items included in their AYCE as well! Our server was great and attentive. This place also has hibachi available in their restaurant! I went at 9pm last night and didn't see anyone in there so perhaps there's a closing time for that section while sushi stays open? Not sure. Located on rainbow and warm springs. I'll be back FERSHER!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch/all you can eat for 21.95. Server was unpleasant. I got 2 special rolls with shrimp tempura inside. The tempura was hard and very crunchy. Wasnt impressed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was great! Our server was very helpful and friendly. For all you can eat, you can't beat it. Sushi was fresh and the taste was definitely there. I would recommend this place to everyone and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and customer service is great! Presentation of rolls are so cute too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi was fresh, and beautifully presented. We had teppanyaki too which was delicious and a great price. The rib eye was very tender, the calamari was not tough, and the shrimp was wonderfully seasoned. Very clean establishment. This is my new favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"So my wife and I went here when they first opened, sceptical because they offered free beers. Ordered sushi and hibachi. They never brought the sushi and tried to charge us. Hibachi was ok ( have had much better at a cheaper price just down the street) not too flavorful. So we really haven't had the urge to go back. Well we got a coupon that said free meal for your birthday. Just went to take my daughter and they refused the coupon because my 8 year old daughter doesn't have an ID... horrible customer service and a good way to loose business. We won't ever go back which is their loss as we frequent other similar establishments and are typically 6 or more people at a time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the atmosphere is great. I definitely recommend. Had the chicken teriyaki and I'm not mad about it. The music is a good vibe too and I'm digging the neon lights at the sushi bar. Come here for your birthday please! So entertaining!"}
{"text":"So my daughter graduated from Palo Verde HS and we wanted to throw her a small party. Back story: we were going to originally have it at Wicked Spoon. After much deliberation we changed our minds and decided on this place. We've been here  once before and had a good experience. Thought hibachi would be a nice touch and it would be a little more intimate compared to Wicked Spoon. Imagine trying to talk to someone you haven't seen in years and having that fresh crepe or creme brûlée in the back of your head. Then having to actually get your ass up to get it. Plus, as the invite list grew worry of expenses came to mind. $55 ish dollars per head at Spoon compared to approximately $25 ish at this place. Yeah...  So the time and the place was set. We spoke with the Manager Derrick who btw during the whole experience was totally available for our Q's and concerns. My wife is a tad OCD(but I still love her) and she made a pre fix type menu to make it easier on the staff. They loved the idea.   This is where this place went above our expectations. We expected 35 people. The OCD wife got there super early and decorated the walls and such. As we greeted guests as they came and kinda took note of the head count we realized we were going over our number. Our wonderful loved ones who said they weren't coming anymore Miraculously showed up! Boom! \"Surprise we made it make room for us biatches!\" 35 turned into 46. I won't get too much into that. That being said, as we continued to communicate with Derrick he assured us that they will accommodate and it wouldn't be a problem. We are that big ass family with kids running around and adults with diabetes complaining when the chefs are going to come and the other adults taking forever to take their damn seats and not knowing what they want to order. Hibachi pre fixe menu. Hello. Hella easy. Don't take 2 min to order. So even with my crazy fam and friends acting the fools, this staff managed and did an awesome job. Food was Great, best hibachi I've had. I would complain that service could of been faster But that was Our fault. Can't knock Bonsai for that.   At the end of the day everyone had a great time. We brought in our own cake they didn't have a problem with that. We even had some time to catch up with our loved ones afterwards which was just as great as the sushi. My family was so pleased we may consider coming back for another big party. Thank you to Derrick and staff. I know it was earlier than usual to have a private party. We had a celebration and meal we will never forget."}
{"text":"Really really good food. Heath was a really good server!!! We were tough people to deal with and he handled us with a smile!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this new sushi steak house for dinner. The food was out of this world good. My favorite was tuna and yellow tail rolls and sashimi! The fish was melting in my mouth! So fresh and high quality. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have some great sushi!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!!! Had the chance to dine this week for the late happy hour.. sushi was great... good prices and service was very good. Make sure you sit at the Grill and enjoy some great food! Good local neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! Had sushi & steak! It's the bomb!!! Great service & food is just good combination! I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"My family was craving for sushi last Saturday, and being Bonsai is new in this area, we decided to try it.  We tried their AYCE.  We tried some rolls. Hand rolls and nigiri.  The seafood they use looks fresh and no \"fishy\" smell.  We like that the fish to rice ratio is just right. Even the rice on the rolls are just a thin layer. So you can taste the other ingredients.  A bottle of Hana Sake is only $20, that's a plus.  The service is is very good.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is their menu for AYCE is not extensive like the other sushi place near me.  Their menu for ala carte is big but the AYCE is not."}
{"text":"Hubby and I always in search of quality sushi, tried this place for the first time. Sushi were fresh and very tender. Presentation is real nice too, don't see that much anymore with so many sushi restaurants popping up. Shrimp tempura was pretty good, looks like they use large shrimp/prawn compared to others. If you order salad, make sure to ask easy on the dressing if u don't like ur salad drenched. No AYCE here, but that's much better anyway: quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate our sons birthday and didn't do much celebrating... Sat on the Teppenyaki side to watch the chefs do their thing... Right at the start the grill broke =( ... So no show or Chef / Customer participation... Chefs need to learn how to interact better with customers... Ordered the 2 roll special and it came out thin... Like 1/2 an inch thin... I've NEVER seen rolls cut that skinny... Wife ordered Filet Mignon Med Well and I ordered The Rib Eye Med Rare... Chef got them mixed up and mines came out almost Well and my Pregnant wife's came out almost raw... Overall experience wasn't pleasant... I believe this place is less than mediocre... And it definitely won't last long if they don't make any SERIOUS Changes... Fried Rice was Gross, tasted like gas and oil... And to top it off, all 3 of us got sick from the food :(  ... Totally wasted $85 for Garbage Food... Definitely worth the drive to the strip for Benihanas... If you want to try for yourselves, its a shot in the dark... If not, save your money... We should've went to Papa Murphy's to get a Pizza across from them... Good Luck!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try since Soho had a wait. We did have somewhat high expectation about this place as it is a newly opened restaurant with good yelp reviews. Turns out it was a full disappointment. I am just giving an extra star because their manager was very polite and prompt to take our complaints.  Nonetheless, as soon as you walk in, the restaurant just has a stinky fried fish smell, which will make you lose your appetite. Our server, Heath, seemed nice and friendly, yet he definitely did not seem like he had enough experience. We ordered the combination menu that had 15 pcs of Sashimi, 12 pcs of nigiri, and 2 special rolls. We chose the sizzling love roll and godzilla roll. We did not mind waiting for the actual order to come out soon since it could take them a while. However, the server never brought out the miso soup or salad that comes with the meal. When we asked about it he did not apologize and then asked us what we would like. We asked for the salad, which was good.   When the server brought out the food, unlike our expectation, the special rolls were served first instead of sashimi. They were drizzled in sauces, which we did not want to have before having sashimi which would have no sauces on them. We asked the server about it and he said its whatever that is made first. I thought when you would actually mention it they would take it back and maybe bring it out later since we were not even touching them, but we waited more for the rest of our food to come out. When we got the sashimi and nigiri, we were not sure why it would take so long. Also, the server just attempted to leave the platter at the edge of the table instead of the center. We had to tell him where to place it as well. The food was alright.  Overall, you get what you pay for. Both service and fish quality were not better than newly opened AYCE places. Will probably never be back, unless I hear that they improved."}
{"text":"Good sushi night spot. We went during happy hour and prices were great. We haven't tried the teppanyaki grill yet, but I'm sure it's good. I've had better sushi at other spots, but this place isn't bad. I would like if they had real crab sushi. Their presentation is nice and resturant very new and clean. Service is great also. Danica was attentive, friendly and respectful. We would come here again."}
{"text":"Not feeling this place. While this place doesn't advertise an AYCE option, it was available. For the price ($27pp), selection (1/2 the regular menu), and quality of the sushi in comparison to other AYCE in the area, this place seriously underperformed.  The service was also very sparse. We waited over 15 minutes after seating before we were acknowledged by the staff.  It wasn't even 1/3 full of customers.  The waiter, while cheerful and professional, barely spoke any english, and referred to the kitchen any time we had questions about the menu.  With quality, a few of the fried rolls came out cold. We had to ask for wasabi and ginger...that was the first for any sushi place we've been to.  Don't look forward to returning here."}
{"text":"Tried this place since it recently opened. You can tell they are pretty new and working out some of the kinks, but the food was good. The place was fun and we will for sure be back! It is your standard teppanyaki with all the jokes and tricks. A fun place to go with a group!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently became a hangout spot for me. I'm just sick of the all you can eat cheap fish restaurants in the area. Not that they are not good but just once in a while wanted enjoy sashimi and not be \"forced\" to eat rice too.   Bonsai is separated into a la carte sushi and hibachi side. For the few times I've been to the sushi side they've always had fresh from the market items like Aji, oysters, king crab legs and uni (my fav!!). The chef special is changed regularly at least they've been different every time I dined in. I've only had hibachi once but it was good as well. Not a huge hibachi fan personally but the quality of meat was good and large portion is always positive. I come here for the fish and their sake. Lychee/peach Hana sake is a must try, perfect to have with a meal and won't knock you off your feet."}
{"text":"Came to Bonsai on my girlfriend's recommendation and it was delicious, fun, and affordable. There was no wait, and even being short staffed everything was executed perfectly. Our waiter Erin was great, chef Jeff was engaging and skilled, and the food was delicious. I had the Cabernet Sauvignon, and scallop with shrimp entree. Soup and salad were good, scallops were killer and the rice, veggies, and shrimp were awesome. Everyone at the table was pleased."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place! They also have hibachi grills but we only had sushi this time. The fish was fresh and savory and the roll selection was great! Heath took good care of us and was very attentive! Awesome place would recommend to anybody!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome service!!  Must come again.  The sushi buffet is wonderful.  If you have a party, special event, this must be your one of the best choice."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted hibachi for her birthday, so we search for a good restaurant that's proximate to our place. We found this restaurant in Yelp with a great review, so we decided to try it. We all had a blast! The place is great, the staff are very courteous and helpful, the food comes in a good portion size unlike in other hibachi restaurant and it taste better too. Be sure to request Thirsten (not sure if I spelled his name right) as your Teppanyaki Chef, he will make your experience fun and awesome. They also have a festive and unique way of celebrating birthdays. Overall, we are having fun and my daughter was so happy with the experience. This restaurant is worthy for my five star rating."}
{"text":"First time at Bonsai for dinner...got seated right away...good food..great service....be coming back and will try the  hibachi..good eats.."}
{"text":"We had come and got the chefs choice sushi and sashimi platter and something from the hibachi. Presentation was beautiful for the sushi. It came out on a platter with an ice sculpture and the fried rice and filet were so good. Ordered a bottle of wine to go with our meal, the server didn't know how to open the bottle and snapped the cork in half.   Overall the food was amazing but the server needs more training."}
{"text":"The service and food is exceptional! Highly recommend getting a sashimi / sushi platter."}
{"text":"Bonsai is separated into an a la cart sushi restaurant in the front, and a Hibachi grill restaurant in the back.  We decide to drop in for hibachi and only had the hibachi entree meal, no sushi. The hibachi entree meal includes a salad with creamy sesame dressing, miso soup, hibachi grilled vegetables, fried rice, meat of choice (I had the rib eye and highly recommend it), and a small taste of shrimp which the chef shoots into your mouth.  The food was great, the chef was entertaining and skilled, the wait staff was friendly and attentive.  I'll be back for more hibachi and to try their sushi menu."}
{"text":"Simply amazing ! Fantastic service and the food is soooooo GOOD !! Definitely a spot to try out if you haven't had it !! So F$&@+=% good !!"}
{"text":"I'm over 30 years old and I'm a big girl. You can just imagine how many buffets I have eaten at. I have NEVER been charged for not finishing our food. I can understand if it was a whole roll of sushi, or if it was self served. Nope. The food was served to us, not knowing the size of the portions. We couldn't finish the plain noodles (no meat, no veggies) and fried rice that we ordered because we thought, being carbs, it would be smaller portions. Nope again! Then BAM! They charged us for NOT FINISHING our noodles and rice. Wow. Not coming back here. I'd rather go and drive an extra 10 mins to Oyshi or Goyemon after this!!"}
{"text":"Both times I tried to get a lunch special here they always have some weird reason that they can't do it.  Today they didn't do lunch specials because of Father's Day.  The restaurant was only 20 percent full so it's not like lunch special customers would take a table away from a higher paying customer - it's just price gouging plain and simple.  I just ordered a rainbow roll instead and they packed it crazy full of cheap crab with slim cuts of real fish on top.  Tried to order a take out roll for my husband (cause Father's Day).  I told the waitress on my initial order and she asked me as I was paying if she should put the order in....no thanks and bye.  I drove down to the street to somewhere else to get it so I wouldn't have to spend anymore money  at this place.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went in for all you can eat lunch ($21.95). Restaurant is nice and staff was friendly. We came in as they were opening. Their sushi menu for all you can eat is very basic and not a huge selection. Slices of fish are thin and just meh. My husband and I have eaten at many AYCE sushi around town and this is by far the worst we've had. Not sure why reviews are so good, perhaps it's the hibachi."}
{"text":"Finally a good, solid Japanese steakhouse close to me. Food was great. Super slow but I'm guessing that's because it's been open less than a month and it's a Tuesday night. Service by Heath was great. Kept my soda water full which is super important to me. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Tried their happy hour menu, salmon $3 and 6 pc hamachi $5 were both incredibly fresh!!! Service was great, will come again!"}
{"text":"I could have given Bonsai a 5 star rating but so disappointed with service. It took so much time waiting for our order. I don't know if they do this in purpose for AYCE... I dined here 2 days ago and my sushi came in so fast since I did the al a carte."}
{"text":"For mother's day my family made a reservation for 5 people at 6:00. When we showed up at 6:03 the hostess said we had to wait for 45 minutes. What is the point of a reservation I asked and she said they have a lot of walk ins...ok I work in a restaurant and reservations are first priority but what ever. I told her we would be back in 45 min and she said she couldn't hold the table...so you want me to sit there with a five year old and two 11 year olds for 45 minutes...ugh no thank you. People make reservations for a reason and we come here ALL the time! Super disappointed and not sure if we will be returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner October 25. The restaurant was very clean and the decor is nice. I was very happy with the food. We sat at the Hibachi table for dinner . The vegetables were very fresh and the meat was excellent. I will come here again. This is a great new local restaurant. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came in around 7 pm on a Sunday night. They were pretty busy, probably only had two vacant tables. I ate here once before (I think during their soft opening) & wasn't a big fan. However, my friend wanted a place where they serve bento boxes so we came here.   I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. This is actually a very large meal. It comes with soup, salad, two pieces of shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, few pieces of vegetable tempura, and a California roll. For $15?? That's a pretty good deal. I love the creamy dressing that they put on the salad, though I know that's probably not healthy lol. The miso soup is okay, nothing spectacular. I'm pretty sure the shumai is store bought & the same ones I have from home lol only they fry theirs & I steam mine. The salmon teriyaki is very good, not drenched in teriyaki sauce & a little crispy!   The service is okay. I think it's because they were busy and our server was pretty overwhelmed. If you check in, you'll get a free mochi! I will be back for the salmon teriyaki!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely awful. The scenery is completely different from their website and all of their happy hours are not as advertised. Looks like a fast food joint and the food looked like it was sitting around for hours. Been to many any many of sushi places in town that are very impressive and this is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Sashimi combo for AYCE dinner!?!? Can't beat that. First time here and the food is delicious! Their staff is so welcoming and great customer service."}
{"text":"I love vegetable tempura and this place has got some serious tempura game!  $9.95 gets you assorted vegetable tempura  with rice, and soup or salad.   The tempura here is very light, meaning not overly greasy. By the taste, you can tell the oil that it is fried in is clean. Of course it comes with the traditional dipping sauce.   Service here is great. The servers are always friendly and attentive. Food doesn't take long to come out at all.   Great food, reasonable price, and great service. Sounds like a 5 star review to me!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends, we all did AYCA, $26 for dinner) Overall great service, friendly environment. Music playlist brought us back to our teen years, all late 90's-early 2000's, so that was pretty cool. Food was good, but a lot of it seemed to taste similar. Definitely would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We came here for EXTREMELY last minute valentines dinner plans and we are so glad we did! Great food and atmosphere, we have a normal spot we go to but we will definitely be making the drive to come here instead. Will be back SOON!"}
{"text":"We love Bonsai!!!  Food is always fresh and delicious, and service is always friendly and impeccable!  Luis and Derrick are THE BEST servers ever!  Bonsai is becoming our first choice when we're in the mood for sushi!  Thanks for always treating us like family!"}
{"text":"This weekend my husband and I went out to Bonsai, a local Japanese restaurant.  It was our second time there.  After dinner, I realized I couldnt find my wallet, and in a panic, we called the restaurant and inquired if anyone found it.  While we scoured the house and truck looking for it, I got a call back from  the restaurant about 15 minutes after I called them.  He took the time on a busy Saturday night to review the security tapes AND walk through the parking lot AND look in the trash cans for me!  AMAZING.  The good news is we found my wallet in a crevice in the truck.  The better news is...  I was delighted at the customer service of this restaurant On a side note...  Hubby and I both got teriyaki bento boxes for super!  The food was awesome!  So glad this on my regular rotation now!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the staff are very friendly. We will definitely be back. Great collection of Sake."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since they now offerred all you can eat. Omg.. it's going to be my favorite all you can eat place now. The fish are super fresh and I hope they stay like that and doesn't start doing low quality fish like other places. The best part is they offered sashimi!! What else can you ask for. I would definitely recommend this place from now on."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot on the southwest side. It has a open area that I really liked. Also in the back I believe there is more private seating. The food is good. Since I am pretty new to the whole sushi things I would suggest you try it yourself I think you will like also. Good food and Parking."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience, friendly staff, clean, simple and straight forward menu.  Reasonable pricing compared to quality. All around good experience"}
{"text":"This has turned into our goto place. Good food, quickly. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Never had a bad time. We go here weekly and never have a complaint. Nice lunch specials. Hibachi. Good prices."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's SO delicious and they are very generous. We went for my boyfriends birthday and not only did they provide a completely free meal for his birthday, they kept sending different staff members over to take free sake shots with him. Great food, great service. What else could you want!"}
{"text":"I came in lastnight with my friend, Food was so DELICIOUS,There also have good environment.staff super nice . I lOVE this place."}
{"text":"The fish quality here is incredible!   The thiccccck slices will leave anyone drooling for more despite how full you think you are!   Ayce selection is not huge but gets the job done' all of the good rolls aren't on the Ayce menu which kind of blows! But when in doubt, nigiri it out!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a hand full of times. The staff is friendly,  the service is fast. We have not been disappointed. The Hibachi is delicious and entertaining the cooks do a good job."}
{"text":"This was my first time here for ayce sushi. It is closer to me so I thought I would give it a try.   I was surprised how many of their sushi rolls were not included in the ayce menu which was disappointing. The rolls we had were decent but they all generally tasted the same. Most of the ones on the ayce used the same sauces. The only one that was somewhat different was the Sizzling Love roll which was good.  I don't think I will come back. There are better places with a better variety I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Bonsai!!! This is our go to place for AYCE Sushi. For only $26.99 for Adults or $19 for children under 12 you get to choose from a big variety on their AYCE menu. Like I mean the selection is big and everything is super fresh. You could choose anything like assorted sashimi, nigiri, rolls, tataki, to kitchen stuff like fried oysters, beef teriyaki, garlic noodles (My favorites) and so much more. The inside of this restaurant is pretty spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. As you walk in you will see all the tables, booths, and sushi bar but if you walk a little further there will be a doorway on the left to their teppanyaki room which is pretty big as well.   Service is always great when we come here. Vincent the owner is super multitasker. I've seen him manage, make sushi, serve, bus, and more. It's always nice to see how much effort an owner puts into his business to make it succeed. Love all our usual servers as well. Erin, Justin, and Derek is our favorites of course. They are always nice, fast, and attentive.   Love the food here. I am always here for the AYCE Sushi. Quality of their fish and food is always fresh. One of the only places I know that serves unlimited assorted sashimi (That is fresh). Love that they have tataki fish as a selection (Limit 2 per person). If you're looking to not fill up on rice this is the place to go bc they have a lot of no rice options for you to choose from on their AYCE menu. Their appetizer selections are very good as well. AYCE comes with 1 mochi per person. You can also get a free mochi if you check in on Yelp.   Miso Soup - Good Salmon Tataki - Good Fresh Tuna Tataki - Good Fresh Cajun Albacore - Good Yellowtail Jalapeño - Great Salmon & Tuna Tar Tar - Good, served on a Pringle chip Salmon - Fresh Super White - Fresh Uni - Fresh Ama Ebi - Fresh Sashimi Combo 10 pc- usually comes with Salmon, Tuna, Super White, Yellowtail, & Cajun Albacore   Cooked Foods  Fried Oysters - Delish Baked Mussels - Good Perfectly seasoned Shumai & Gyoza - Good Shrimp & Veg Tempura - Love the light crispy batter  Beef Teriyaki - Rare - Love their teriyaki sauce! Awesome Garlic Noodles - Extra extra garlic! BOMB!! My Favorite!  Overall this place is wonderful and I recommend it to everyone. It's been my go to AYCE Sushi place because of its convenient location, spacious seating with usually no wait, awesome service, and good quality fish/Food. They do tend to be on the busy side when it's dinner time tho. They have good Happy Hour Specials as well as good priced lunch combos. Come in on your birthday with Valid State Issued Photo ID to receive a FREE AYCE Sushi or Teppanyaki meal. Major plus there for you to enjoy a complimentary meal while you dine with your family and friends."}
{"text":"We had the filet, ribeye, and chicken hibachi. Everything was delicious and flavorful, we didn't need the sauce for anything. The meat was super tender! I do wish the miso was served with more salt and hotter, but there was kids at the table. All in all, really great food! They also have a buy one get one free deal on beer! The decor was nice and clean, service was great. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First AYCE sushi place in Vegas. I have to say the quality for the price is pretty good here. Came here for lunch to celebrate my moms bday and we had a pretty great experience. They have AYCE sushi for $21.95 for lunch (doesn't include the dinner options: uni etc) $26.95 for dinner. Good place to check out if you're craving ayce sushi.   They also have Hibachi that starts at 3pm but is not include in the ayce menu."}
{"text":"Ate there twice now and every time I go the service and food is better than the time before. I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"We did all you can eat here and the food was ok. I noticed the Teppanyaki side was the busy side so maybe I need to try it again on the other side the server seemed annoyed in the beginning..but warmed up eventually. The only thing that really stood out for me was the tuna tataki and the unlimited mochi you can get. Oh and if you have a toddler- just letting you know they charge $19 for 3 and over..."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a sushi spot and I remembered that this just opened up so we gave it a go and everything I must say was awesome from the ambience, our server and of course the food . Definitely recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. Food is so fresh. Alice and Bobby were so hospitable. Hidden gem that we Will absolutely be back to. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Second time In this restaurant, I could said I definitely love this place, the food are very fresh, we ordered sushi & sashimi combination, the presentation of the boat was amazing, fresh sashimi of the day, we also got uni and Boston ebi, it's very delicious. Our server Alice was very friendly and she suggested few items on the menu for us, we love how we can tried some new stuff every time we came. The decoration is very modern and the restaurant is clean. $16.96 for 2 giant sushi rolls was for sure a good deal. Glad they open so close to my house, price is very reasonable, fast service, would highly recommend everyone to try it out. You will fall in love with this new restaurant"}
{"text":"Finally! I've been waiting for this place to open since it's so close to my work. My girlfriend and I came in for lunch around 2:00 and ordered a pair of their lunch special bento boxes one beef teriyaki and one the salmon teriyaki. The lunch special deals are between 11:00 and 3:30 which is perfect for almost any lunch break.  The bento boxes are huge! I've never ever seen a bento box this big. For under $10 you get a very good meal including miso soup, salad, rice, fried shumai, 4 pc roll, and your entree. The food was really good which is why it gets 4 stars right off that bat  I'll most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night and opted for a table versus their hibachi. We wanted some sushi :) Bonsai's interior design was actually very nice. It was very modern with pretty blue lighting by the bar. It was just very empty when we went. I think we were like the only table there that night. There were two tables when we got there but they had already left by the time we ordered.   My boyfriend and I decided to share three rolls. We got their Alaskan roll, which was a salmon and avocado roll. Then we got two special rolls: the Sakura roll, which was spicy salmon crunch with shrimp avocado and tobiko on top and the Godzilla roll, which was spicy king crab topped with salmon, eel, avocado with tobiko. Two special rolls for $16.95! Really decent pricing.   Bonsai puts a lot of effort in their plating. The special rolls were put on a nice plate and they even put a fake plant on the corner to make it extra special.   As for the sushi, it was pretty decent. There is nothing to write home about and their rolls aren't out of the ordinary. They're pretty standard. I mean, for the price, it's good if you want some sushi and don't want to pay up the yin yang. And the rolls definitely fill you up. Plus, they have a really nice variety of rolls.   The only problem that we had is that on their menu, they have a Rainbow roll and a S. Rainbow roll. My friend ordered a Rainbow roll but they gave her the S. Rainbow roll instead. Perhaps they should rename the S. Rainbow roll cause it was the chef that got confused on that. And you certainly don't want to confuse the chef.   Overall, decent place. If you're in the area and you want some rolls, could definitely visit Bonsai. I personally prefer SoHo but I understand that SoHo doesn't have a lot of rolls for you to choose from."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was outstanding. We had the teppan.  Best veggies and fried rice I've had in this city. If you go before 6pm, you save 3 dollars per meal, plus discounted drinks and appetizers.  I highly recommend Bonsai."}
{"text":"Excellent service very nice presentation every keep everything tasted very good definitely going to come back very fresh enjoyed it you should come and look at this place"}
{"text":"We just had the best teppanyaki dinner in a really long time!  From the very friendly server (I wished I got her name because she was amazing) to the awesome hibachi chef David everything was excellent!  David prepared everything to perfection plus he has great presentation too!  The ribeye melted in my mouth and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I can't wait to share this experience again with friends and family very soon."}
{"text":"Had all you can eat with my bf for our one year. Great service and even greater sushi. Had the pleasure of having the manager, Vincent, tend to us. Great experience, couldn't recommend this sushi spot more!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out this place since they were building it. Wow! So glad I finally came in today. The food is great and the price is very decent. You can actually taste the freshness in the sushi and sashimi. I especially love the oysters. The bento box was very tasty. The plating is amazing. Very creative. Service was exceptional especially from the manager Alice. She was very engaging and checked in on us several times. The decor is very modern and chic. It's a great place for date night. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Started with Kani salad - crab/cucumber/roe in a mayo sauce. Excellent. Cowboy roll- great integration of sushi and steak. Tropicana was delicious with the fresh mango on top. Odyssey  and Godzilla wonderful mixture of flavors. Tempura is perfect- light and crisp not overly oily. Presentation of all is novel- large platters with little bonsai trees on corner of plates. Alice the manager was very attentive and informative. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Not only was the food good but the service was great too. I ordered the yellowtail with jalapeños and ponzu sauce ($8.95) the Godzilla roll ($12.95) and the salmon teriyaki plate ($13.95). Everything was very fresh and tasty. Our waitress was attentive and gave great suggestions. I'll be coming back and bringing family and friends."}
{"text":"I like the tepanyaki experience over the dining room (reason for the 3 star). The food is decent and the atmosphere was pretty lively. They definitely are more attentive in the tepanyaki room than in the dining room. We waited a very long time to get our food when we dined-in. Regardless, I would still recommend this place. Their cold sake was pretty awesome. Sushi was ok."}
{"text":"Since Bonsai is close to where I work, I decided to check this restaurant out for their bento box lunch specials. I've been looking forward for this place to open because there can be limited options for me to get food on time when I am on my break. My coworkers also recommended this place for their cheap lunch specials and their fancy dish arrangements.  I called Bonsai one day to order a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box during my break. Since it was around $9, I would consider this lunch bento box to be very affordable, and there are also a lot of options that you can choose from, such as chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki. When I came to pick up my food, I got a salmon teriyaki lunch special instead of a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box. I was kind of disappointed because I wanted to try their shumai and California roll, but at least I got to try their salmon teriyaki, rice, and miso soup. The salmon teriyaki and rice were very appetizing, but I believe that I should have gotten the salad instead of the miso soup.   I am giving Bonsai four stars for now because I believe that there are still improvements that they can make since they are a new restaurant. If you ever order to-go, make sure that they give you the right type of meal because there's a chance that they can give you a lunch special instead of a bento box for example. One day, I will try their very presentable sushi dishes and their teppanyaki when I have a chance!"}
{"text":"My best experience of hibachi in Vegas. Our chef thurston was so amazing to our family. Especially our little 2 1/2 year old boy!! He can't wait to go again!! That's saying a lot for a kid we have to keep occupied if we want to eat out. We live on the other side of town but are now more than happy to make the journey:) btw the food was delicious too!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, maybe even good but the service was another thing. Maybe because I was alone and they were thinking my bill wouldn't amount to much.  At any rate, there were two tables occupied. The waitress took forever to take my order and it also took forever for my order to get done. For Pete's sake I only ordered soup and grilled fish, so with so many restaurants around, not sure if I'll be coming back to this restaurant again. Good service is very important to me, especially given the selections of restaurants around this area now."}
{"text":"Great staff and food.  We enjoyed the hibachi again tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Will definitely be back again.  Loved the bday song they played their for another table.  Quite the production!"}
{"text":"This review is limited as all I ordered here was a bowl of miso soup and a spicy tuna roll.   Both were tasty and delivered in timely fashion.   The soup was hot and seasoned well.  The spicy tuna was beautiful in presentation and was very good.    The service was subdued and not rushed.  It fit perfectly with the vibe of the restaurant.  We really enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"When all in with the all you can eat Sushi....$26.99 well invested! Everything we tried was beautifully presented and super fresh. Tried other items on the All You Can Eat Menu including the noodles which was one of my favorites (had 2). The plates are app size great for trying something for the first time. This will definitely be on my Map of Return Food Spots. Way to go for Niece Addi who recommended this spot. Hooray to Team Bonsai!"}
{"text":"We went in here as they just opened the location near our house.  The food was so so as well as the service.  I didn't feel that 20% tip was in order.  I left 10%.  A few days later when I was checking my Amex card, someone there added their self a tip on there that was 30% of the check.  I disputed with Amex and received a refund."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Great atmosphere, delicious Japanese cuisine, phenomenal guest service. I highly recommend dining here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love that happy hour is all day on Tuesday's ... sushi is good not extraordinary but good. It was pretty empty and the waitress was very attentive. I'll definitely come back because it's close to the house and the happy hour prices were great."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for these sorts of places--a place can't really do both sushi and meats well, generally speaking. But I ended up here, and had a good enough experience to give it a mild thumbs up. I had three items--an avocado hand roll, a sweet potato hand roll, and Ikura nigiri. The Ikura was ok, a bit small but tasted pretty good. The avocado roll was my favorite of the three; in general, they got the shape of the hand rolls correct, which is a prerequisite for me to give them the thumbs up. The sweet potato roll was a bit less distinctive as the sweet potato was a bit hard in it. Service was professional.  So, basically a 3.5 star experience. I'd go back again. But I wouldn't race back."}
{"text":"We came here for their hibachi/teppenyaki.   The service was great. The server kept refilling our drinks and was on top of all the dirty dishes. Thanks Heath!  The chef/cook, was the downfall. Everything tastes the same. Way too much garlic in everything! He used the same flavor profile for chicken, steak, and shrimp. Butter, garlic, soy sauce, salt and pepper. On everything. The vegetables too! Add in some sesame seeds. Because why not. There was very little entertainment from the chef. The chef/cook catered to the other family. He had the server bring them out sake and drank with the other family. Any \"extra\" portions were given to the other family. Unimpressed and perturbed."}
{"text":"This place is always great the prices for happy hour are crazy!!!! All day happy hour on Tuesday we shall see you every Tuesday we love it me and my friend the service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"This place is ah-mazing! The hibachi is the best in the valley--fresh and delicious. Their sushi is like a work of art... and tastes great, too!  The atmosphere is modern and welcoming and the restaurant is very clean. The staff is polite and and provide a friendly and accomodating take for their guests. They are open for lunch and dinner, giving the option of lunch deals in addition to a full menu. We are so lucky that this place is so close to home! This is undoubtedly going to be out new spot when in the mood for a delicious meal! 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This a very cute and delicious spot!!! The service was very fast and friendly.  We had hibachi and some fancy sushi rolls.  Presentation and taste was great...we are definitely happy we checked Bonsai out!"}
{"text":"We ordered salmon skin salad, crunch roll, bento boxes of shrimp and beef with miso soup, house salad, 2 shumai and vegetable tempura included! Everything is delicious the only problem was we specifically asked for the salmon skin on the side but they gave us soggy chopped off skin mixed in salad. Still good but we're a little dissapointed we wanted the skin crispy. Guess they didn't read the memo at all."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this spot and glad we did!! Lunch specials start at $6.95 and full Bento box for $8.95!! Best lunch prices and food I've had in vegas. Great service as well.  At night they have the hibachi tables so will definitely be back for that!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner last week and sat at a regular table. Ambiance was nice but the food was not worth the money. My food looked pretty but taste was not. All of my food was not hot in temperature at all almost luke warm.  I ordered a bento box which essentially had grilled chicken teriyaki which had a rubber texture that I had to send it back.  The dumplings were cold n rubbery, miso soup wasn't even hot. Tempura was soggy and the waiter forgot my rice til  I mentioned it.  Oh ordered a hot green tea n had to send it back bc it wasn't hot. Waiter was like it looked steamy. My meal was like around $15 and I had better at a fast food teriyaki bowl place. I'm a supporter of small businesses but if the quality of food isn't good I can't support them.  I chose this place bc of the great yelp reviews... I do not agree with any of the reviews."}
{"text":"Great prices for two special rolls. Hamachi Kama very good. Two for one beer, we were in! Sushi was elegantly presented and tasted wonderful. The cucumber wrapped sushi was well done! This spot is deserving of more visits. Waitress and staff wonderful. Two thumbs up! Or a big high five. Or wait, I know; 5 stars. Wish my tummy could hold more to try more. We'll just have to come back!!  Thanks Bonsai for being so convenient....."}
{"text":"The Hibachi is good portions at a reasonable price with a friendly entertaining chef.  They are even accommodating to substitute extra veggies in place of rice or noodles. Happy hour is from 3-6 and 9-close $3 house wine $2 draft beer $3 off Hibachi and apps are $3-$7."}
{"text":"So far the best AYCE sushi place I have tried in Vegas. The only thing I wish to change is the amount of rice for all the nigiri. Service is attentive, and all the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"It reminded me of a diner, not the greatest ambiance... but the food makes up for it fresh and even creative.  Erin was attentive and friendly plus happy to clean up after my messy 1 yr old.  We tried a roll with 3 different topico.  It was my fav.  Great prices 3 special rolls for $16.95 and a 20% cash back offer on Groupon ."}
{"text":"This place was A-OK. My boyfriend and I stopped by for Happy Hour, and while affordable, our visit could be summed up as decent but forgettable.  One of the better menu items was the yellowtail jalepeno. Although one dimensional, it has a great kick.   Some decent options include the tuna, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri (2 pieces per order) at $3 each. The fish quality is okay, but the rice wasn't the soft and supple dream I hoped it to be.  Another okay option is the tempura mix. It comes with two pieces of shrimp, one piece of broccoli, sweet potato, zucchini, green bell pepper, and onion. While generous, the batter wasn't light and fluffy, but dense and oily. The sauce is okay, but for the happy hour price of $5, I'd say it was a pretty good deal.  My boyfriend was the least satisfied with his chicken negi-maki (too much cream cheese) and the gyoza (okay flavor). He was much more satisfied with the regular menu items he ordered. While the ono nigiri was okay, the beef teriyaki was, by far, the best prepared menu item. While it came on a bed of partially raw onions, the cook was perfectly medium rare. Maybe this is a sign that their teppanyaki side is better?  Overall, I probably won't come back for the sushi. It was okay quality at best, and I feel like there are better options elsewhere for the same price range. If I did come back, it'd have to be for the teppanyaki."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving poke one night, unfortunately it was so late every poke spot was closed, but we came across this sushi place and decided to check it out (since it was the only thing close to raw fish and beer).   The environment is relaxing, the restaurant was divided into two sections, one for sushi/sushi bar and one for teppanyaki where chefs cook for you at the table. We caught them on a slow night so the restaurant was fairly empty when we got there, so no wait. We also dine in time for happy hours, they have variety of selections, already a happy camper. This sushi place is not AYCE though. Everything was great, food was good and price was fair considering the good quality of the fish. Definitely would come back and recommend!!"}
{"text":"Tastes great and resonable priced. Will return! Sushi are fresh and roll are yummy too."}
{"text":"Wow..completely shock that I not been here yet! Late night Happy Hour menu was amazing. Fish was very fresh. Good size pieces. I'm totally coming back and shout out to our waiter Luis he was great!"}
