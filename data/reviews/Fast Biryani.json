{"text":"I'm a fan of reviewing based on expected results (in other words I wouldn't rate a fast/carryout place based on formal restaurant expectations).  That being said, the establishment was decent (as good or better than expected for a non-formal dining setting) and the food that I got in the lunch special was terrific. The basmati rice has a great flavor that went well with their curries.  With a range from somewhat spicy to very spicy, the flavor was delicious across the two curries and the soup/curry (whatever the third item in the lunch special was today).  The naan was average; I have had some better naan, but it served its purpose alongside the curries. The rice pudding (Kheer maybe?) was pretty good, but I'm not a big dessert person so I could take it or leave it, but it was nice after the spicy curries. The place was clean, I ordered and had my food within about 5 minutes or less and the guy taking orders was friendly.  This was $8 for lunch (with plenty left for dinner) that did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food is sensational and very reasonably priced. The staff are very hospitable and accommodating. Highly recommend! I'll bring people back."}
{"text":"I work very close to this place but was open-close by myself and couldn't leave work.  I called to see if they could deliver and at first told me I'd have to call Mr.Delivery but after I mentioned I'm right down the street said it wouldn't be a problem.  I was stoked and ordered my paneer tikka with rice and naan.  10 mins later they were dropping off my food.  I gave a very nice tip and he said \"oh that's too much\".  I said \"um no it's not and I'd rather give that to you than a delivery service\"(no offense delivery services).  I had some things to do before I could sit down to eat and wouldn't you know that at least 30 mins later the food was still piping hot and DELICIOUS!!  I haven't had this experience since I left LA and I think it even tops that.  So happy this place is so close to my work and home!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here on business and tried this place out. I've never eaten India food much beforw, bit was very impressed and absolutely loved it. I lamb biryani which wasn't really hot but rather spiced just right. Price was great as well."}
{"text":"5 stars for a spectacular vegetarian lunch special.  Curry, rice, dessert for under $8. I totally did not mind the \"fast food\" ambiance or that the meal was served on a plastic tray (please don't let this deter you from experiencing quality Pakistani grub at a reasonable price)- the food is DELICIOUS.  I will be back.  Thanks FB!  V"}
{"text":"We heard about Fast Biryani when we moved to the east side of Madison a few months back. I have wanted to try it but kept putting it off. Today I took the plunge and got a chili chicken wrap to go. Absolutely outstanding! The FAST in the name stand for Falvorful Aromatic Spicy Tasteful and it was all of those. A generous portion of spicy chili chicken in a naan with veggies and cilantro, a great lunch. They also have a lunch buffet that I intend to try. I gave them 4 stars because of this was only one meal, but the lunch wrap itself I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"So glad I found this little gem. Very pleasant inside but took my food to go. Good flavor and level of heat.  Can't wait to try it again"}
{"text":"We ate at Fast Biriyani last week for dinner and found the experience incredibly subpar. The ambiance has been noted in other reviews - it looks like a fast food restaurant with plastic booths and order at the counter - and the prices mostly match that. (Which is nice.)  The first thing we ordered was chai, which was not masala chai but a chai made with saffron and a lot of milk. Masala chai would have been better, and we won't order their version again.   The dal fry (a thick creamy dal stew) was pretty tasty and moderately spicy and I would order this again. The baingan bharta, however, was nothing like the smoky eggplant curries I've had at other restaurants. It was essentially a tomato-heavy marinara sauce with eggplant and felt out of place with the rest of the fare.  Madison admittedly does not have the best Indian food compared to other, larger cities. There is, however, much better Indian food and selection at Maharajah's, Maharani, or Swagat. Fast is a quantity over quality place,  and if you're looking for good, cheap food on the east side, go to La Taguara and get an arepa."}
{"text":"The Chicken Biryani (bone-in) and Mutton Haleem are very good. I'm glad I read previous yelp reviews about the Haleem. You get a good serving size for the price of the biryani, but I wish I received a little more for the Haleem. Both foods were very aromatic, right touch of spiciness and tasty. I'm going to try the Chicken Tikka Masala Biryani next time."}
{"text":"Superb!  There chicken biryani is so addictive and amazing.  The flavors on the chicken are spot on and the meat falls off the bones.  The chicken korma is very flavorful.  I can eat the sauce with a spoon, like a soup.  I don't even care that the atmosphere is plain.  The food makes up for it.  I really want it to stay in business so go eat there if you like Indian."}
{"text":"You must go during the lunch hour, 11:00-2:30, I think. The Thilini is wonderful. 3 curries, rice, naan, and a cup of some delicious desert. All for $7.99.  This is absolutely the best place ever. It has become my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp while passing through Madison on a road trip. It was pretty empty for a Sat night--one guy dining when we arrived, one family that came in for takeout, and another couple arriving as we left. We ordered chicken tikka masala, and chicken Biryani (not to be confused with Brianna, that ONE girl from high school). We were going to order the Biryani boneless, but the owner suggested we try it bone-in, as it would be more flavorful. It took under 10 minutes for our food to be delivered to us. The owner was very helpful and took the time to discuss the accompanying sauces. Everything was very flavorful and delicious. Yes, the decor could be better, and the women's bathroom needs a hook for purses, but everything was very clean and the owner and employees were very friendly. They are rolling out a new menu and we hope business continues to grow for them; we would stop again. Signed, Berry Cake and Musselshoals"}
{"text":"Not just fast, but best briyani!! Very courteous staff,excellent food!!  Ordered chicken boneless briyani was excellent! Majestic chicken was among the best I've ever had. Masala chicken briyani was new but very flavourful"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch special! 3 different curries, 2 daals, rice, naan and dessert for only $7.99.  All fresh made and so good. I'm very impressed!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place accidentally.  I believe it used to be a Mexican restaurant.  They haven't done much to update the aesthetic, but the food makes up for it.  I've only done carry-out.  Both times I got the boneless chicken biryani.  The second time I asked them to add hot sauce to the order.  I'll likely try something else next time just for a change of pace.  Both times the chicken was very tender and the rice was tasty and aromatic."}
{"text":"great value.  we have traveled to India 4 times and felt that the food tasted as authentic as any Indian food in Madison.  tasted very fresh.  loved the dal fry.  thalis were also very good. the food is a little on the spicy side (which we like) but if you prefer food that is mild then mention that when you order."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch expecting great food from the reviews we had read, guess we went on a bad day. The food was not very nice.  I had a chicken biryani and it looked liked it was food that had been left over from the night before that had been warmed up in a microwave. It was barely warm and very badly presented.  It was in no way freshly prepared that day. So disappointed  as was really looking forward to trying the food here."}
{"text":"Found this place while on a business trip in Madison. I went to try it out and on the weekends they do a buffet. The people that work there are very friendly and the food is excellent. I definitely recommend this place if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"I don't know what everybody else has been talking about but this restaurant is pretty awful. The vegetable biryani had old dried out vegetables in it and a strange taste. The poor potatoes had been thoroughly overcooked, the peas looked like they were straight from the can. And did I mention the naan bread was unbelievably horrible? I have never seen naan bread with the texture or appearance this bread had. I could go on but it will be even more depressing. The quicker I forget about this place the happier I will be."}
{"text":"We have been here at least 5 times since opening and it is by far our new favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. Our favorites are Chicken Tikka Masala & Chicken Masala Briyani. If you want something really spicey (husband loves all things that are spicey enough to make him chug a gallon of milk) get chili chicken, they have it as an appetizer or a wrap, husband says it's the most flavorful & spicest Indian food he's had in Madison. Perfect amount of spice and flavors in anything you try! It really is fast and the owner is a man who has a real passion for sticking to traditional gourmet  & keeping old family recipes alive."}
{"text":"Biryani was not upto the mark. Cannot comment about other dishes.. but then y would u name it fast 'BIRYANI'  if ur speciality is not that. Haleem was good and was almost authentic! Worth a try once but definitely not a regular outlet for me.."}
{"text":"What a nice change in SUCH a chain filled area of town. I love this little place. Very quick for work lunches. Staff is friendly and efficient. I would prefer to not eat off of cafeteria trays, tin foil, and styrofoam cups but if it's their thing and it helps keep prices low - I'm fine with it.  The food was great. I got the vegetarian lunch combo - even with a pop was about $9 total. So much food! Order at counter, staff bring it out (I like not having a waiter sometimes). Would love to try their biryani!"}
{"text":"I had their Thali lunch special, non-veg. It was $10 and came with 3 curries, rice, naan, and a porridge dessert.  Two of the curries had chicken and one a fritter. The one with the fritter was yellow and amazing. This was a thinner sauce but had great flavor. The fritter had great texture and flavor. There was a brown colored curry that was the texture of yogurt. There were good chunks of chicken that were cooked well. There was a good spice to this one. The last curry was very thick, almost to chutney territory. Once again the chicken was great and a very solid flavor.  I had a hard time deciding whether to dip my naan in the curries or eat them over the large serving of rice. The naan had a good flavor and a perfect slightly chewy texture.  The dessert was almond flavor and very thin. I talked to the owner afterwards and he called it a porridge. When I think porridge I think thicker, but either way it was great. I usually don't go too crazy for Indian desserts like mango ice cream but this was worth the trip by itself.  The owner was super nice and the place looks way better then when it was a burrito place. The food was done before I finished paying which had me skeptical, but I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times now and the food and service are excellent.  I've had the Chicken Qorma and Veggie Samosas.  Perfectly spicy but not too hot for me.  Portion size is good too.  I am looking forward to trying their buffet, so I can sample more of their dishes. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Indian meal I've/we've ever tasted as a new customer!  Staff & meal were so  awesome and very personable.  Quality of food, restaurant and customer service were impressive!  Highly recommend to locals, travelers, and just plain hungry folks who miss a good mouth watering Indian meal to try and get a great fill of awesomeness!  Best of all is they cater too with free delivery if you're a new customer!  Just call them and they'll cater to your every wish!  Happy eating with Fast Biryani!  Biryani is an Indian dish made with highly seasoned rice and meat, fish, or vegetables that means the price you pay is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I have been to Fast Biryani several times and enjoyed each visit. Their chicken masala biryani is just so good--they warn you that it is spicy upon ordering, but it's not too spicy! The spices impart an excellent depth of flavor to the dish. I've also enjoyed the chicken tikka masala--moist chunks of chicken and delicious creamy sauce over rice--as well as samosas. At Fast Biryani, you order at the counter and your food is brought to you fresh and hot. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I really waivered between 2 to 3 stars. The parking lot to this place is small, also felt it was weird that the dumpster was out in front (not appealing!).  I went one weeknight evening for take-out.  I found their menu a little confusing.  I ended up ordering the Paneer Tikka Masala and 1 Chicken Kabab. It took probably 10 minutes or so for my food to be ready. I was a little horrified to see that the Masala was a yellowish/brown --every other time I've ever ordered Tikka Masala, the sauce is a orangish/red color (tomato base).  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it did not taste like Tikka Masala at all.  The Chicken Kabab was OK. I had to throw away the ends as they were so dried out and hard I couldn't eat it.  It was pretty spicy as well.  I did like the yogurt sauce that was with it. I wasn't very impressed by this place, but may give it a shot again one day."}
{"text":"Very good food!   Fast, friendly service.  I asked for garlic naan, which they don't offer.  But was a solution they gave me some tasty butter naan with minced garlic in the side!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is some of the best curry I've had in the Madison area. I've been here twice and had the Paneer Makhni and the Chicken Tikka Marsala. Loved them both. I ordered to go both times. The naan was delicious and the rice was spiced perfectly. Not only was it \"fast\" (I got my meal within 5-7 min) the staff was always super friendly. I will be making this a regular spot because there is a very nice sized menu to explore and I have not been disappointed so far."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise on our road-trip through Madison.  Enjoyed a vegetarian paneer with well balanced tomato based curry.  Huge portion of rice.  Naan was great.  Just wish they had larger cups for water."}
{"text":"Just had one of their wraps for the first time and wow...I didn't know what I was missing.  Chili Chicken wrap was amazing!  Lot of food for the money, tons of flavor, just the right amount of spice (I like it spicy, this satisfied).  Highly recommended if you've never tried one, surpassed my expectations.  A perfect take out lunch!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our good here. It wasn't the best Indian but for fast and really reasonable I would go back. The samosas were awesome and spicy which I love!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place a hundred times, but have never stopped in to try it. On a mission to try more restaurants around town, we decided to finally stop in for a visit.   We like to try a variety of things whenever we go somewhere so our review isn't skewed by just one or two items. So, we ordered a couple appetizers. We have never had a fried green pepper before and we thought it sounded good, so we ordered that. Be warned! It is not a regular green pepper. It is a flipping jalapeño! That's fine and dandy and we love spicy, but we probably wouldn't have ordered it as we've had fried jalapeno's before and wanted to try something new. We also ordered the typical naan and samosas. The naan was average, nothing special. The samosas seemed different than other samosas I've had. They weren't bad, just different.   So, on to the main courses. I ordered Daal Makhni for my son. He doesn't eat meat so this sounded fantastic cooked with a \"mild\" set of spice. Holy Guacamole! This was not mild in the least bit. He couldn't even eat it. It was tasty, but boy was it hot. Next, we ordered both the vegetable and chicken vindaloo. We were warned that it was spicy. Now, I LOVE me some spice, very much. I'm addicted to it, actually. But, this was almost unbearable. The flavor was good, but we could hardly eat it. It was very heavy and thick, too.   Overall, the experience was good. I'm not sure we'd go back, but it's worth checking out if you like Indian and you don't want to pay the prices for a full meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Place was quiet on a Saturday night, no idea why.  Good food, good service.  Kind of fast food decor but food was obviously freshly made.  Good flavor and the heat was medium on the hot stuff.  Good selection of things and staff helped with explanations of things.  This place is worth keeping around so hopefully business picks up."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my meal today. I often order the daal fry. Today I was shocked. It was pretty much spicy water. No onions and zero texture. You could have just ordered watery soup. I don't know if chefs have changed or they just didn't really care. We were the only people there so it's not like \"busy\" can be a reason. My mom ordered a wrap.  Apparently you now make it yourself these days?! Today was NOT a \"wrap\""}
{"text":"I can tell that the kitchen has some serious culinary potential and they are really nice... but it recently opened, so there are some things to work out.  The lunch special was okay - 2 small curries, a small meat, rice, naan, and dessert for $9. One curry was nice, the other was bland, the meat was okay. We also tried the Makhani curry which was very subtle and complex with lots of cardamom - could have used a bit more pop, but interesting.   The \"side\" rice portions are completely huge - like twice as much as regular. Dining in is served in all plastic/Styrofoam containers - they need some plates for eating in. It took about 15 minutes to get our food, so the \"fast\" part isn't necessarily true."}
{"text":"Polite employees and tasty food. Ok value for the money and quick. Madison goes to bed early so it's nice to have a restaurant like this locally that's open late. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The food is tasty - the rice has all kinds of spices in it, and was a lovely compliment to the main dishes.   Seating is like a fast food restaurant, so the hubby and I took the food to go, but the people were friendly while we were there."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with our lunch at Fast Biryani.  We both ordered the non-vegetarian lunch special and everything had great taste.  The flavors were all very distinct and there was no shortage of spice.  Definitely on my list of places I would return to for lunch.  It's like a quality Indian fast food!"}
{"text":"Hungry and with low expectation swiped my phone to fix my indian food craving.  Surprising Madcity has a secret. The dum biryani is the bomb. So is their Haleem. As a NYer I am very jealous and hope they open an authentic hyderabadi biryani place in NY City or Long Island.  Time to chow chow ..."}
{"text":"This place was just about on point.  I ordered the \"fast\" regular chicken biryani (not the spicy masala). Included rice, a leg and thigh and a white yogurt-like sauce. They have all your favorite dishes: Lamb Biryani, Curries, Chicken Tikka Masala, Korma and many others.  The rice was lovely long grain basmati,  Which had most of the flavor.  Though I ordered the regular biryani,  for an average American palette this could be uncomfortably spicy.  If the yogurt-like sauce (simular to Greek tzaziki sauce without the cucumbers) is eaten with the rice, it brings the level of spice down considerably.   One thing I be live that would really complete this biryani  is raw red/white onion and a boiled egg for a garnish.   The decor is color coordinated, nice detailed pictures on the walls explaining a selection of dishes.    The dining tables and booths were very clean.  Though the booths need some TLC and redesign.  I think the fast food standard wood booths take away from  the attractiveness of the place.  The staff was friendly and I do believe I was served by the owner of this establishment.  He is a charismatic man with a can-do smile.  He personally served my husband and I.  Even though we ordered one dish, he was considerate enough to bring an extra plate.  I would say I had a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Tried it once would never go back, food was beyond horrible and made me and my friend sick. Don't waste your money, lots of better options out there."}
{"text":"Decent food. Very very basic settings if you decide to eat in house. Looks like a very old-school fast food restaurant, very worn and smells a little bit of cleaner, etc.   They put your food on \"cafeteria\" style trays, basic forks and knives, this is basically as cheap as you get.   The food is decent, very hot (temperature). The naan could be much better. Very bland.  Probably a better choice for carry out. I would probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"Go eat here, but keep your expectations in check.  I was staying at a nearby hotel with a colleague and we needed a quick dinner, and love Indian, so headed here.  We were a little dismayed by the decor (looks like an old Subway maybe?), which was clean but not very inviting.  The menu was also a little dodgy, but we persevered and ordered what we wanted. There was one item we wanted they didn't have, but otherwise we had 3 entrees to share plus naan and drinks.  The food wasn't fast, but it was very, very good. The owner was obviously concerned about our welfare and happiness, making sure we had all the plates and utensils we needed.  For $25 we got a LOT of food (we couldn't eat it all) and an interesting experience. Do I wish it was 'nicer' and that they'd had that one item we wanted but were out of? Sure. But I base this review on my actual eating experience.  Advice to owner: get better eat-in plates and utensils. Plastic/paper is fine but get better quality. NO ONE uses Styrofoam plates any more, and for good reason. You could offer heavier plastic utensils.  I'd go again, with more realistic expectations. This same food at MY local Indian place would have cost twice as much and been about the same quality."}
{"text":"Chef takes great pride in his food and their biryanis (both masala and regular are excellent). We make it a point to pickup food every time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"I don't know why Ms. Athonia gave this restaurant 5 stars. I'll have to get with her since we were there together.   The \"lightly\" spicy vegetable noodle dish was ON FIRE. I do like spicy, but this one was Hydrant worthy. And this was after the owner had described it as \"mild!\"  Also, the okra masala was bland  and also way too spicy to handle, even with cooling yogurt sauce poured on top of it. The dish was visually unappealing (it looked like a bowl of mud!) and the okra was soggy/mush. The whole thing needed salt, Tajin (which I travel with), CARDBOARD...ANYTHING, really, to up the flavor.  The only saving grace about this restaurant is the fact that it's the only vegetarian non-chain restaurant in this particular area of the city. Every other choice is either bbq, fast food, or Hooters!  My advice: make the drive into downtown Madison's State Street and find something tasty from a local restaurateur."}
{"text":"Order anything off the vegan & vegetarian side of menu!  Dal, curries, pakoras and vegetable thali are among the many vegi option. ...and for the love of god, be sure to request the spicy green chutney?  I took away one star because the okra masala (bhindi masala is the usual name) was not great. Most indian places fry the okra so that it's crisp and add it to the curry last minute. This okra had clearly been cooked into the soup. It had that mushy texture that causes a lot of people to hate okra."}
{"text":"Great, friendly customer service.  Good mix of Biryani, curry and other small bites. I tried the Chili Chicken, Chicken 65, Pasindey and Makhani. All were very delicious and full of fresh flavor with a good level of spice. The owner is very friendly and takes a lot of pride in the fact that everything is made from scratch and all the ingredients (except the spices and the rice) are sourced locally. Looking forward to returning next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but this place deserves one. I am not from Madison and may not visit Fast Biryani again for a long time but already know I'll be having cravings for it that will make me want to visit Madison again just for this place alone. Food was really tasty, the Paneer Tikka Masala I tried was not overtly spicy, and the restaurant was clean and nicely maintained."}
{"text":"Freshly prepped food, pleasant service. Nice to support an independent business instead of all the franchises across East Wash. A few bugs to work out still--machine ran out of ice before our visit, the drink selection is limited and the wall menu had a paper sign over one category, presumably because they sold out. Had the boneless chicken biyani which was very flavorful and perfect with the light yogurt sauce. Will likely try again."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have driven past this place but never ordered. Today we ordered two meals for delivery. There was half as much food as there should have been and it cost twice as much. No rice was delivered with the butter chicken, even though rice was included in the price. There wasn't much meat or any vegetables in the biryani, either.   As a recent transplant from the Bay Area, I was going to give this place zero stars, but I will give two for effort. I will not be returning. Hopefully we can find better, less expensive Indian food somewhere else in town."}
{"text":"This place has good food from local sources. My food was prepared very quickly. The person at the counter was friendly and informative, he seemed to be in charge or the owner, I didn't ask to be sure. I don't know a lot about Indian food and he was helpful in telling me what things were on the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I've been here a few times, and I have really enjoyed the mutton pasinde, as well as several of the biryanis.  I plan to hit this place up every time I come to Madison, and I'm really happy that they're open so late.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tiki noodles with rice and naan to take home. It was really, really good! Spicy, satisfying, and enough for the three of us to tear into it at 2:30 p.m. on a weirdly rainy and warm December afternoon. You can watch them prepare the food in front of you to a degree, which is pretty cool. Daughter went from \"No, I don't want Indian food...\" to being a fan. Large portion of white rice with some spices and a ton of noodles and delicious bites of chicken.   We've had a nice portion of spice to fight off the bugs that might come from this crazy weather.   Plenty of vegetarian options here--which is almost  always what I get when I order Indian. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit grossed out by my experience here. \"Fast\" to them seems like just keeping everything low quality. Ordered the chicken masala biryani and two samosas. Got water cups. Water from the fountain tasted gross... and then I found a baby spider floating in my water. Alrighty.  Food came out and it seemed pretty legit and  slopped together. First few bites were good and then the spiciness caught up to me. Had to load it up with their creamy sauce which was delicious and cut down the spiciness a bit. The sauce for the samosas were good too and the samosas were decent.   While some flavors were good, likely won't be back..."}
{"text":"Was there to pick up dinner based on good reviews. Chicken 65 was good, biryani was bland and not good."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 8pm, hungry and tired after a long day. The owner was very friendly and recommended the chicken briyani to my husband. I had the qorma curry. The portions were generous and the food was tasty.  I do wish that the curry had a little more depth of flavor, however.  It was very slightly spicy, which was great, but there wasn't a ton of flavor behind it. The owner came over to ask how the food was and offered my husband more sauce to go with his meal. Overall it is a decent place to stop if you are looking for a quick, easy meal at a good price."}
{"text":"I was heading to the Eastside and was running my head through places I have heard good things about.  Fast Biryani popped into my head...so up the frontage road I went. The inside is very fast food joint in appearance.  Very bright yellow and orange with the pressed wood booths.  The counter service makes you think the food is going to be sitting out but they cook everything to order.   I ordered the Butter Chicken, rice, and naan.  The Butter Chicken and rice had a nice flavor but it wasn't as good as other places on the west side or Monona.  I think I missed the boat by not getting the Biryani on my first go round.  Looks like you get a huge serving of Biryani when you eat in.  The naan was well made and pre-cut for easy management.  I took my order with me and it was well packaged.  I would stop again if I was in the need for Indian food on the Eastside of Madison."}
{"text":"Worthless half hearted attempt at food. I went in with a colleague to try the mutton biryani. It was overcooked, dry. Served on school cafeteria quality plates. The spices seemed ok on the meat, but not properly braised before baking with rice. Maybe the curries are a better choice. Just went with the namesake. Sorry I went there."}
{"text":"Spicy food lovers rejoice!   Biryani is hot, the meat is tender, and I'm personally a huge fan of the mango-strawberry decor and fast-food vibe.   The samosa was the best I've ever tasted in the U.S., and the chutneys are not at all tepid. This is a lovely addition to Madison's East side, and more people should hype it."}
{"text":"What could I say about this place ... Biryani and Haleem, two of my favorite dishes back from my hometown.... The preparation is really authentic, fresh and tasty.... The pricing is pretty reasonable and timings are very flexible."}
{"text":"Stop here for wonderfully fresh, fast and ethnic Indian cuisine. Sit in for a casual dinner or lunch in fast food style booths, or take out with you. Either way, you'll be treating your taste buds to delicious Indian food. Very glad to have this new addition to our side of town. I recently stopped in with my son, and was unsure of what I wanted to order this time. A young man at the register recommended the biryani. It is their specialty, and is very good (I've had their chicken biryani before and it was wonderful). After telling him I was thinking about a curry, he then recommended the qorma, so I chose the vegetarian qorma. Anazing! The beautiful enticing aroma itself is enough to put me over the edge. I asked for medium heat in spiciness, and next time I'll ask for mild, cz whoooo doggie.... it kicked for sure. Even my husband who likes spicy things was taken aback. But, hey, a sweet mango Lassi helps cool things down. I love their food here. I could even feast on their basmati rice, and all it's amazing aroma and taste. Everything is very nicely done here. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are on an Indian-food binge streak and stopped at Fast Biriyani the other day. Its rather curiously tucked away in terms of location. The decor is a screaming canary yellow and doesn't have an inviting feel which is why we tend to carry-out from here. Be warned that their food is very spicy and often times their \"mild\" could pass for \"hot\" as per my palate (and I am Indian!). On a cleanliness quotient - it's perpetually sticky floor does not garner any favors. However, what it lacks in ambience, it makes up in taste (provided you have asked for the right spice level). I specially love their wraps, bang for the buck and full of flavor.  Having grown up on the coast, I have a refined palate for fish and I think their Apollo fish is as good as you can expect from a town in the mid-west. My husband attests that their dum biriyani is quite good as well (not top-shelf, but definitely good). But, their \"pasendy\" seems to be a confused halfway between two different entrees that shouldn't have been mixed together. I do not recommend it.  Over all, if you are looking for a gratifying dinning-in experience, you are not going to get it here. But if you want a solid, quick-fix to your Indian food cravings, 4 out of 5 times you wont be disappointed. Just remember to ask for the right spice level (which for me turns out to be \"EXTREMELY MILD, please\")."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  Coming from an Indian - I tried food from this place two times and both the times my experience was below average. The food was ok tasting, didn't blow me away. I had the spicy chicken biryani, i opted for the extra spicy version of this hoping the kind of spice I always have when I myself cook or when I eat at other restaurants. But I was wrong, the spice was so harsh and felt almost like raw uncooked spice harshness which burns your neck when you swallow. Now here by spice I am not talking about the hot chili, I am talking about the other Indian spices used in the dish. After having a bad experience first time I thought I'll give them another chance, I had chicken korma and naan, korma was so bland and didn't taste like korma curry at all. The naan was ok too, had thick doughy taste to it. I am going to wait for few more months to be able to convince myself to try this place again. I still am hopeful about this place and maybe i will be able to find something I love!! Will update my review when that happens!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! My family and I tried 3 different meat curries. They were FANTASTIC! The naan was OK. We enjoyed the glass bottle sodas. It was a bit expensive, but then the portions were HUGE, so maybe not for what you get. We will definitely share next time. I didn't give 5 stars only because the decor is a bit lacking- not much change from the former burrito place and the floor was SUPER sticky! But I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the rave reviews are about. Had a really bad experience here. It might have been because I went with the veg fare but I will let you be the judge of that while I detail the experience.   I walked in and asked the person behind the counter in Hindi what the best vegetarian dish is. He says I don't know. I eat only non vegetarian food. I looked at the board and under curries decided to go for aloo gobi (literally potato - cauliflower).    Now, there are many different ways people make aloo gobi. But this was bad. The cauliflower florets and potato pieces were too large. What little flavor the dish had was on the outside of the potatoes and cauliflower. Additionally the dish was dripping in oil and was more or less a dry vegetable dish. I mean, it would definitely not be under a curry. I asked about what it would come with roti or rice. I was told that it comes with roti but I can add rice extra extra. While that was factually true, such a dry dish couldn't be had with rice.   I ended up leaving most of the food on my plate and not taking it to go. Try it at your own risk. If you do decide to try it, I suggest you stick with the non veg since that is what most people are talking about."}
{"text":"The owner was friendly and made a good conversation. Chicken Haleem - 4 very authentic Hyderabadi style made really fresh with ghee. 5 if he put more fried onions Chicken Biryani  - 3.5 was very fresh and tasty Veg Biryani - 3. No salt. Not up to the mark.  Mirchi ka Salan - 5 very very tasty and correct Hyderabadi flavor (made my veg biryani taste a lot better) Mirchi Bajji - 2 very soggy no filling in the mirchi. Not fresh at all Overall very good for new restaurant. We will go here again to try other items. Especially the thali. People of Madison: you don't have to drive all the way till Chicago to eat good Haleem!"}
