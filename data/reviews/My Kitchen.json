{"text":"This place has really gone downhill, although their rice roll (Cheung fan) is still wonderful.  The congee is not cooked well, the fried dough is cold and hard. What's worst is that I ordered curry fish ball n turnip and it was cold, when I asked the waitress she said it is impossible, then she walked away...then she went to the kitchen n loudly complained about my inquiry, then she came back n asked if I wanted to\"ding\" it which means microwave it!! 3 other tables also got their orders wrong as well."}
{"text":"This place makes the BEST steamed rice noodles, also congee is not bad too! The seating may be a bit cramped but this is like HK fast food, what do you expect!"}
{"text":"My Kitchen is the place to go for genuine Chinese food. I love this place and have been here at least 10 times, despite the fact that it's at least a 15 minute drive from my place. If you want some congee, rice noodles (Cheung fun) and noodles, I recommend you check out this place. 
The owner is a friend of my father, so we always get good service, but I see others get the same kind of attitude (that is to say, welcoming and open). 
It's a small restaurant, not with much seating, so if you want to come, either come early, or late. 
Personally I'm not a fan of congee, but whenever I need to eat something less greasy, I'm coming here. Their congee is perfectly flavoured, nice and light, and the toppings are to most people's liking. Just pick whatever toppings you like. 
The rice noodles are what people would call 'bae'. Whether you like the ones with the fried donut pastry (Sta leung), or the ones with the shrimp (ha cheung), or you just want the plain ones with nothing inside (I think it's called Jiu Cheung fun or bat cheung), you're going to get the best you can imagine. Perfectly rolled, with good portions. you can't go wrong getting one of these. 
Last of all, what I always order, the Cantonese fried noodles (gon dong chow mein) is packed with veggies and meat, and fried to perfection. You have a perfect ratio of dry and crunchy to damp and filling. This is mainly what leaves me coming back. 
Perfect portions, lots of choices, and genuine Chinese food. Whenever I get tired of the homemade Chinese food, I'm coming here."}
{"text":"I wish this place had a more descriptive or memorable name. I always struggle to recall the name when I'm suggesting the restaurant to my friends! I end up telling them \"it's the restaurant with the green sign, right next to the MTR karaoke place.\" haha

The menu here consists of Cantonese and Chiu Chow food. They often have new dishes or specials featured on their blackboard too!  I've been to the restaurant numerous times for dinner, and the quality is always consistent. I've tried most of the authentic Chiu Chow dishes (braised duck, oyster congee, fried noodle sticks) and they're all pretty good. 

The steam rice roll (cheung fun) is absolutely amazing. I usually add all the sauces and sesame seeds before devouring the whole plate by myself! =P The best part is that they're available during dinner time. (Most places stop offering them after lunchtime)

The tofu fish soup is excellent. It's very flavourful and they definitely don't skimp on the ingredients. Make sure you have more than 4 people with you since the portion is rather large.

Another item to recommend is the fried seafood cakes stuffed with 3 ingredients (that's the literal translation since I have no idea what it's called in english). My family usually avoids deep fried items, but the seafood cakes here are too good to pass up. They look and taste similar to western crabcakes - only these are much better! =)"}
{"text":"Bowl of congee comes with a lot of fillings, they don't cheap out.  However I ordered the minced beef, and it's not minced, it's actually strings of meat.  But the lady was great, she was so nice I didn't want to complain.  The dough fritters wrapped in rice was yummy but the presentation wasn't pretty, the dish came very messy.  The customer service was great so this place gets 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I woke up one morning, and decided to crash an open gathering here. 

The place is the worst looking restaurant I have seen in a long time.  No effort on decor, crammed, I've seen waiting rooms in ghettos more dignified. 
I asked for a whole preserved egg, they said they only had it diced.  NOBODY SELLS PRESERVED EGG DICED!
At least Jennifer K helped with reloading on my congee, so I didn't had to do any work.  The variety of congee was quite impressive for such a shabby venue.
I found all the congee to be average, until someone ordered a certain 'style' of congee indigenous to a particular province in China.
As soon as the spoon entered my mouth, I was transported back in time to my childhood, during my pre-school era.  This was the exactly the type of congee I was fed in pre-school.  I began to feel emotions I've not felt for a long time, then suddenly I needed a hug.
Jennifer K was too far away from me, to my left was a dude, and next to him was this crazy woman who gave me the most condescending look after telling her I voted for Rob Ford.  So I just gave myself a mental hug.
Ambiance is always  first for me, but no restaurant have ever made me want to hug myself, so..hats off I guess.

The food is average, unless you had a childhood like mine.

It's freaking buzzing on Weekend mornings, so come early."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for congee.  Their congee is very good, not too salty and has a great texture.  We especially like the signature My Congee that comes with a good amount of seafood.  The fresh rice noodle rolls are the freshest we've had in Toronto and are a must try.  Extensive menu of other items for lunch and dinner too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ah. Everyone remembers their first time. Some people say their first time is over to fast, others recall that it took way too long and others still say their first time was the best time ever...

My first time eating Congee (he he he see what I did there), .....was this past Good Friday and the place of my inevitable Congee-deflowering was at My Kitchen. Thanks to Wayne for being gentle as he and my yelper pals guided me through the process of losing my Conginity. 

For my white friends not in the know about Congee, this is a type of Chinese comfort food. It's a soupy/watery rice which resembles porridge infused with different meats and veggies done in various broths. It comes to the table in giant bowls and you shovel spoonfuls of the stuff into your gullet unsure of what surprises await you with each passing bite. It was a strange new experience, but all in all it was pretty good. 

We had other dishes which included glutenous rice filled with meats and sauces, as well as noodles and deep fried dough that was lightly sweetened (my fave part of the meal).

The venue was nicer from the outside than it was once we entered. Kind of a hole in the wall BUT if I've learned anything in my tenure at Yelp it's that the holes in the wall pump out the best chow! Aside from the aesthetics My Kitchen was PACKED!!! People really dig this place, so if anything that should tell you it's authentic!

Best of all was the price, a buffet of rice, noodles, bread...CARBS for under $10/person. Score! It may not have been my favorite thing I've eaten for brunch BUT if I'm ever in a pinch and need a filling food fix on the cheap...I'm hitting up my kitchen!

Side note: The map indicator for this place was wayyyyyyy wayyyyyy off, and I ended up parking almost at Hwy 7. I've fixed it now so you should be able to find this place no problem (along Leslie just north of Premiere Banquet Hall)."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0

They have around 100+ options for congee as well as a very extensive menu with various rice, noodles, side dishes etc. Given this, it's hard to pinpoint what their main focus is as a small restaurant where dishes may vary in quality.

Congee here is nothing really to talk about. Found their liver a bit stiff and rougher in texture. 

Beef rice rolls were pretty smooth though it's hard to distinguish what's in the beef. Looks like they loaded it with starch or something to make it super smooth."}
{"text":"One of the better congee places around the area, and who doesn't like good congee? Was feeling a bit under the weather, so I wanted some congee for lunch. Came here with my family and ordered a couple things to share. 

Got 2 bowls of congee: Beef Congee and Salty Egg and Minced Pork Congee, along with some side dishes: Dough Stick in Rice Rolls, Sticky Rice, and Fish Balls, Pig's Skin and Radishes in Curry.
Both congee were quite good, though I like it better when the beef is put in the bowl raw, and cooked by the congee poured on top. The salty egg congee was quite good, and a unique combination I hadn't had before. 
The side dishes were quite good as well, though the curry was mostly just spicy without much flavour. 

Service here is always top notch, which is one of the reasons I like it here. Super friendly staff, always ending their sentences with sir or ma'am, and quick on their feet. 

Will try and make my way over here for more congee in the future, even though it isn't quite the Hong Kong street style I like the most!"}
{"text":"Came back a week after my first visit.  Had some Wonton Noodles and rice rolls.   A little disappointed this time.  I think I had the best stuff on my first visit.  While passable, I thought the wonton noodles were heavy on the salt and msg.  Service was still very good, similar to the first visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a steam rice roll with fried donut pastry in it. It was the best thing I ordered and it was also the cheapest $4.50. The crispy noodles with bbq pork and bean sprouts were ok, nothing great but it wasn't bad. The bbq didn't taste like char siu pork at all. 

I also ordered the fried tofu stuffed with eggplant in a black beam sauce.. It was good too,again nothing out of the ordinary.  I would only order the steam rice roll thing again. 

Bonus: the dim sum hot sauce is in a squirt bottle. Bonus star awarded!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is very limited to say the least, however I have a thing for small family owned restaurants.

The congee here takes a bit longer than other congee places, but I see that as a benefit.  It means they are taking the time to let the congee absorb the flavour.  It is great. 

I would also have to agree with Jennifer K, the fried sesame dough is so good.  Very unhealthy, but I feel like it is less unhealthy since it isn't very oily.

Great quick snack place."}
{"text":"a great little family run place that opens late and a nice little place when you want to skip the big chain places congee queen, congee wong etc.

great congee that's perfect texture with a a lot of ingredients in each bowl and a lot if selections as well. its not bleech white like some places, very natural and clear.

there's a large selection of snacks to go along with the congee

take out is really quick too when you have a cold and feel like some congee

prices are very fair and lots of parking at the plaza."}
{"text":"Thanks @Jennifer K for letting me know about this place. My favorite congee place is at Market Village and I find it a pain to park there and dine there so when Jennifer told me that one of the staff from Sams opened My Kitchen, I was pretty excited.

Arrived here on a Friday at 6pm and it was quite empty but by 7pm it was 90% seated. 

4 Stars as this location has all the favorites from the Market Village one, ie. Congee, rice rolls, steamed radish, etc. plus it has a whole bunch of other main dishes and portions are huge! I had enough for dinner and leftovers for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I didn't write a review for this place?! Ohh.. thought I did.. but better late than never... Lol..This is one of the places I usually like coming for congee and food like that...it's not the closest to home so I always need to kick myself to come here...\

Ended up ordering congee, noodles, \"cheung fun\" (traditional dim sum)...They have a load of stuff on their menu so it's hard to actually say one thing is better than the other and vice versa..

I personally like the Cuttleballs with seaweed Rice Noodle cuz the size works fine..the cuttleballs are nice and chewy, that's what I like about it the most...Congee has a good flavor and adequate ingredients...

We ended up ordering a congee with multiple ingredients..just when we wanted to put some in our bowl...my friend noticed there was a piece of hair in it...arghhh...ewww....disgusting...

Thankfully, the waitress that was serving us was being courteous and nice...same with the female boss...

They told the kitchen to make us a brand new one while leaving the old one on the table..I have to give that a (+1 star)...because that's what I call service...most places when you tell them there is something in the plate..they take it away and pick it out and give you the same one...let's be honest here..=P

We knew this one we received was new because they bought out a new one before taking out the old one..so I must say 99% of Chinese places do not do such and this is probably one of the fewer ones that's willing to do this...

Good service, adequate food and courteous!

I'm coming back..no questions asked..=D"}
{"text":"Honestly I have lost count how many times I have visited this place over this past month alone.  Their food and service never fail.  

You can always count on them to make very shoot,  fluffy congee with lots of ingredients added,  no matter what style of congee. My favorites are the duck egg (pei dang) pork congee and the fish tofu seaweed congee. You can always count on the steamed rice rolls (cheung fun) to be so fresh. If you order these rolls for take out, they pack the sesame seed topping, and three different sauces in mini containers for you to fully enjoy the steamed rolls. My other favorite is the steamed daikon/radish cake. 

There are many other selections on the menu and you can count on this kitchen to whip up something tasty. 

They have morning meal sets. I got my congee and steamed rolls (or chow mein if you like) for $6.25 this morning. 

Definitely get the bang for your buck. 

This place is packed for lunch and dinner so hurry!"}
{"text":"This review is for a dinner experience.  Dining at My Kitchen used to be better.  It was cleaner; the services was more courteous.  The chef remained the same, so the food was similar to before.  The Chiu Chow chicken was not good this evening.  The portion was good,  It was an inexpensive meal.

There are lots of selection for congee that is well cooked and laden with MSG, typical of congee places.  The chef is a competent chef capable of more complicated dishes.  I know because I have eaten it before, a long time ago.  I guess the competition is getting to this place."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot of diffent little dishes here. Some were good and some were bad but for the most part it was good. Once we finished ordering the food came out within 2 minutes and fast too.

Weordered the My Kitchen special congee which is basically a seafood congee with shrimps, fish and squid. The seafood were the cheap fozen stuff for sure and no where near the quality you can get at Congee Queen. The congee lacked flavour and was overly thick aswell. Another dish that I found was below average was the fried noodles. They were dry and once again lacked flavour. 

Everything else that we had though were done pretty well. All the rice rolls were nice and tasty but I still find the ones at Sam's Congee Delight were a step above in terms of the smooth and silkiness of the rice rolls. The pig intestines were also done really well. The outer skin was super crispy and the sweet and sour dipping sauce made it all the better.

Speedy service, decent food at affordable prices. Nothing mind blowing but good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and usually I order the \"My kitchen congee\", but for something different I wanted to order cantonese chow mein.  Also ordered a char siu BBQ pork rice roll.  The chow main came in huge with a huge amount of fried noodles. I probably ate too much as later on I had a stomach ache from too much fried noodles.  The taste was great with a good mix of meat, seafood and veg with a think brown sauce for the noodles to soak up.  Prices are very reasonable.  Decor isn't anything special but the price and selection is pretty good.  Mostly R-Hill-Markham locals frequent the restaurant.  I like how the restaurant has a big window so you can see the kitchen production!  Order the congee on a nice rainy or cold winter day!"}
{"text":"4.5

For me, Saturday mornings usually consist of either dim sum or congee.  I love both and for me, My Kitchen is a fav place to go for Congee.  This review focuses only on breakfast time.

Pros:
Lots of congee to choose from
Many side dishes 
Food comes out fast

Cons:
Not many seats

As I said, I love my congee.  Sure, there are the usual suspects for congee (Congee Wong, Queen, Time etc.), but I like these small places a little better.  They have a more homely feel which reminds me of getting congee back in Hong Kong.

My Kitchen has an extensive list of congee.  Most places have about 10-15 different types for you to choose from.  My Kitchen has at least 40, I stopped counting after getting there.  With so many choices, you will never get bored.  congee comes out super fast and hot.  I actually prefer the congee here to a lot of places.  It's always spot on and very much the like the ones I got in Hong Kong growing up.

My Kitchen also does some very good side dishes.  Their steam rice rolls are very good.  Like all congee places, you need to have your deep fried dough fritter and My Kitchen is no exception.  The fritters here are a little smaller, but they have a better taste in my opinion.  You can basially skip the congee and just order side dishes if congee is not your thing.

The only problem with these homey hole in the wall places is that they are usually small.  If you don't come early in the mornings, expect to wait a bit.  There's no table larger than 6, so if you come as a big group, it will be tough for them to seat you all together.  This isn't something necessarily their fault, but it does hinder your experience when you have to wait long for seats.

All in all, My Kitchen is a great place to go for congee.  Just show up early to avoid any wait."}
{"text":"Aside from the cheap combos from 8-11am, I don't see how this place is a 4 star at all. The beef cheung fan is so underwhelming.. no chestnuts no flavour. The beef tastes like beef + water pulveruzed together into a flavourless beef spam. The rice noodle wasn't that great.. it was stickier than I like it. I prefer it more smooth. Soy sauce is not sweetened enough like the dim sum ones. I don't eat fried dough rice noodle but my partner said it was freshly fried and good. The salty egg pork congee had a generous serving of salty egg but the pork was sliced (I prefer minced). Flavour for pork salted egg congee was good, but only because of the msg used. The minced beef congee looked like shredded beef.. but the lady explained they mince it and squeeze it into small vermicilli-like beef noodles. Tasted gross. Combos had no veges at all and small servings in the combos so I really only see it as a snack place. My preference would be to not come back..."}
{"text":"This place always offers the best and authentic Hong Kong style congee and steamed rice noodle roll (Cheong fan) in town besides Sam's Congee in Market Village."}
{"text":"Holy $#!+ this restaurant is noisy, cramped and feels like a hole in a wall. However, the friendly service, good price and decent food quality allow me to give a solid 4-star rating"}
{"text":"Really like this place.  They got this lobster E-mein that I cannot get enough of. They also got really good congee and dough fritters.  My favourite!"}
{"text":"My theory of this is a small world after all is so right. 

When I walked into My Kitchen... the waitress recognized me right away... Gee? Am I that famous as a yelper so the establishment will be in awe and felt so honoured that I come and review their business finally... 

Ended up the owner/the cook used to owned another business that I frequented and since the previous business closed down and he moved to open up My Kitchen and that was more than 3 years ago! 

My Kitchen's menu has a mixture of Cantonese cuisine and Chiu Chow Cuisine. The selections here are quite vast and with this kind of menu, you will able to find something that you enjoy! 

Lunch Specials $6.99 includes soup or HK style milk tea and an entrees.. 

Rice in Soup with assorted Seafood 
- a huge bowl of goodness includes veg, mushroom, scallops and shrimps 
- my lunch mate finished the whole order by himself without sharing.. it must be quite good, since he is a really picky eater 
- We opt for the daily soup instead which is fresh baby snow sprouts with chicken... nice and delicious and have tons of veggie inside 

Cuttlefish Balls with Seaweed Rice Noodle Soup ($4.50) 
- Chiu Chow Style restaurant are supposed to have good freshly made Cuttlefish Balls...and I am not disappointed.. tons of diced cuttlefish in each of the balls and they have great bite 
- Tons of seaweed... and they are suppose to be good for you: has anti oxidants and low one's blood pressure 

Rice Roll with Dried Shrimp and Green Onion ($2.75) 
- Freshly made to order!! I love rice roll in any form and with or without stuffings.. 
- Peanut, Hot, Sweet and Roasted Sesame on the table for you to custom made the perfect sauce to go with your rice roll! 

Fried Sesame Dough 
- I can eat the whole thing all by myself!! Though it is deep fried, but not oily at all... and the dough has a hint of sweetness... hmmmm... no sharing please!! 

So if you want to have a real Chinese breakfast which consider of congee/deep fried dough/bean sprout fried noodle, My Kitchen does have breakfast set from $2.99.

And if you want to try to have some authentic Chiu Chow style dinner.. this is the place to go to too!! 

They accepts Mastercard, Visa and Interac!"}
