{"text":"We've been regulars at the Apricot Tree for ages, for both dinner and dessert. The schnitzel is my favourite dish there, though sometimes I'll get one of the specials (usually when they have duck or veal). All of the desserts I've had there have been delicious, my favourite being the dobos torte. However since this is apparently a difficult dessert to make, it's unusual that they have it. 

Over the past year, this restaurant has lost most of their regular staff and has seemed to suffer from that. Now that those staff have been around for 6-8 months, they finally seem to be getting in to a groove and service isn't as slow as it was months ago. We've never had unfriendly service here, just slow at times. 

The portion sizes also seem to have decreased a bit. With the schnitzel, I have to ask for extra mushroom sauce because the small cup they serve isn't enough. That said, the price point at this restaurant is very fair. 

There is a patio to sit on, but it's right beside Dundas and can be a bit noisy at times, though it is nice to sit outside. 

I'm sure we'll continue to return to The Apricot Tree, though it would be nice to see different specials or menu items as it seems to always be the same. There is a schnitzel fest coming soon so I look forward to that."}
{"text":"Nice environment and service, but food is pricey for its quality, I had a chicken crepe for $16, it was drenched in sauce, and the chicken pieces was very dry and hard, I ended up leaving most of the chicken untouched."}
{"text":"This place has been a family favourite for years and we go there for almost every special occasion so the staff know us by now! Food is always outstanding and creative, especially the crepes! Both the dinner and dessert crepes are out of this world and during crepefest, they have an even bigger selection! Everything is made from scratch including the ice cream/gelato and kudos to the chef and his wife for keeping the daily specials so interesting!"}
{"text":"Favourite brunch spot! New, bigger and more modern space was a pleasant surprise on my last visit. Their available take out also makes for an easy gourmet meal to pick up on the home from work.

One thing never fails to disappoint is the freshness of their menu. The seafood dill crepe and eggs florentine are my favourite. Daily quiches (I've had a couple of different ones) are of generous portion sizes and flavourful. 

This goes without mentioning the pastries! So rich and often my family's take home treat."}
{"text":"Always a great food experience.  Family has been coming here for dinner, special occasions and lunches for years.  Food is amazing and prices are very reasonable for the quality.  A true gem in a land filled with chain restaurants.   The decor perhaps needs updating and the service can be a bit slow at times but always very friendly.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. The dessert items we had were at a reasonable price but I've had better food elsewhere (with more options available). The place seemed a little dusty and geared towards older clientele."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful place. Wonderful cousin, very good service, calm atmosphere, you feel like at home. I suqqest you to have dinner there)"}
{"text":"Took my mother-in-law for her birthday.  Service was warm and friendly and we all generally liked our food.  I ordered a salmon wrap and it was fine.  The apricot salad I had was excellent.  Very cozy place and I will also go back in the spring/summer when their patio is open."}
{"text":"I heard such great reviews of this place so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I had the evening's special which was a basa fillet with rice and veggies. My husband had an item off of the menu which was the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes.  We also both had french onion soups to start.

The soup was okay. I've had better at other places. I found it too salty.  I wasn't sure what kind of cheese they used but the cheese kinda fell flat with this.

The basa fillet dish was nicely cooked, albeit bland.  The rice side was essentially steamed rice with bits of broccoli.

My husband's ribs were phenomenal. The meat was perfectly tender that it came off the bone clean.  The sauce was great.  The mashed potatoes were so-so. Could've been done better.

What was great were the desserts. My husband had the tutti frutti crepe which was an ice cream (can't recall the flavour) with mixed fruits. Meanwhile I had the apricot crepe. Oh my god. This was soooo delicious.  The crepe was filled with apricot mousse, with an apricot-ginger ice cream on the side, as well as apricot chutney. 

I think I will come back to this restaurant mainly for the desserts. I'm craving for another round of crepes tonight!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. It was a last minute reservation but I am so glad I came here. We had their anniversary special and everything was delicious! The service was fast. We were always asked how our food was and what else we needed. The place didn't have a candle for her cake so instead they wrote Happy birthday around her plate- That was super special."}
{"text":"I'll literally never be back to this place. Staff is very confused at all times. Don't know up from down. The food is whatever I used to go cus it's been a staple place in the neighborhood, but the food isn't extravagant. 

Also they make it the most complicated thing on earth to get a lunch menu for you take out at any time, as if they're Doing some grand favor for making you a chicken sandwich. 
Used to be good, but Christ they've forgotten their place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The first time I came here I went back the next day. Pretty much anything you order on the menu is delicious, especially the desserts. Service is friendly & professional. Definitely one of my favorite cafes in Missasauga!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Apricot Tree multiple times and each time I have been very satisfied with the variety of food. Service can be a bit slow at times and the servers are pleasant. I love the crepes and the pastas. I think that the portions are a reasonable size. I'm sad that Starbucks closed down as there is no free WiFi. I've only tried their desserts once but it was rich and decadent. Next time I'll try their gelato. 
The last time I went the fire alarm went off but the server didn't say anything. At first we were confused but figured it was nothing serious since no one was paying attention to it, even though it was quite loud and annoying. 
Another thing. I was signed up for their newsletter and I was waiting for my birthday gift but never received it. I looked on their website and found out you have to opt in via phone number. I'm not sure if they sent out an email regarding this but I was a bit sad as I would have liked to use my birthday gift last year. 

Nonetheless I will continue to support this fantastic quaint restaurant :)"}
{"text":"It was a mixed meal for the family.  Excellent chicken/tarragon crepe and lamb shank; however, the Coq au Vin was rather disappointing.  The chicken itself was very bland and much overcooked.  Disappointed to see that the dessert/cake choices were very limited to compared to before the renovation.  Still one of our favorite of ours in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken tarragon crepe and it was very strange tasting.  Had to send it back and order something else.  The mushroom panini was also very greasy and heavy.  The desserts are nice but a bit pricey.  Also like the apricot salad.  Had an upset stomach last few times I've gone here."}
{"text":"Great food- we ordered the chicken tarragon crepe which was absolutely delicious. The cream was so tasty. My son had the chicken flat bread. The cheese they use is cheddar on top ( would've like mozzarella) and the vegetables were too big to bite on specially for a 4 year old . The dough was pretty tasty . Not the traditional flat bread but nice for a change."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here since I was in the area and someone closeby recommended it. The places packed so service was a bit slow but the waitress did apologize a few times for the wait. As for the food, I was blown away by every dish that I tried. There was a lunch special roasted red pepper and tomato soup for $5 that was absolutely delicious. Very fresh ingredients and very flavorful. The beef tip crepe, which was also a lunch special item was a bit pricey at $17 but the meal exceeded my expectations. Very balanced flavours. Tender beef tips, exceptional gravy served in a light crepe with a refreshing balsamic vinegar salad. I shared another lunch menu special, the special wrap, which had sausage and sauerkraut with a dijon mustard. Great pairing of flavors on the plate. Dessert, which I found out was their specialty was equally as scrumptious. Picked out a walnut crunch pie from the display case. Amazing dessert for $5.50, which needed to be split for 2 people. Not too sweet but very rich and beautifully presented on the plate with whip cream and a raspberry coulis. Pistachio ice cream for $2.50 was very fresh, had chunks of pistachios and was also delicious. Definitely worth another visit as I highly recommend this place if it's within your budget. A lot more menu items that I'll need to try out."}
{"text":"The food here is luxurious, and very good.  The café had a very nice atmosphere, and I felt very warm and welcome.  I love the plaza it's in, it feels as if you're in a movie, very clean and cute.  We only came for dessert since we already had dinner elsewhere, so we ordered the Sorbet Platter (it had no alcohol, and I brought my young nephews), and I liked 2 out of the 3 ice creams they put on there.  I also got the Green Tea where my nephew got the Various Fruit tea and they both were exceptional.  
Lastly, I got the Apple Cheesecake and it was also very good since it was light and had a nice crunch on the outside.  I would return again, but I always have kids with me so the alcohol filled menu isn't that suiting."}
{"text":"First impression...homely.  Second impression...busy!  

Went here for dinner with friends on a Friday night and we were so surprised to see it packed!  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table.  Come early!  And do not expect to be seated in a large group of people, it's far too small for that.  

Don't order appetizers-they are far too small and far too expensive.  We ordered the mussels thinking there would be a pound for our group of 4 to share.  Instead, there were 5 mussels total.  Yes, 5 pieces.  They were tasty, but we were shocked when we saw the plate.  

We ordered the crepe special for dinner which was a chicken and mango stuffed crepe in a tarragon cream sauce.  Our crepes did not have any mango in it, but it did have plenty of chicken and the sauce was really delicious.  Hubby ordered seafood pasta.  Meh was the answer.  

Dessert was...meh.  We ordered one creme brulee and one crepe.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?  

So overall, just a meh experience.  I would go back however just to try the desserts because everyone else on yelp is saying they're amazing...I dunno.  Someone tell me which dessert to order!"}
{"text":"Let me start my review by saying that I'm something of a dessertoholic. In addition,  I spend a lot of time wishing that the cafes in Mississauga were a bit more like the ones I remember from Europe.

Since this is about as close as I think I'll get to middle European sweets in this city, it's definitely become a perennial favourite for me. Though they commit the cardinal sin of using phyllo dough for their strudel (it's not the same thing as strudel dough, darn it!) I noticed the emptied tubs of quark in their kitchen which gave me faith in their relative authenticity. 

To date I've had the topfenstudel (absolutely great), the poppyseed strudel (too sweet with not enough poppy, I think I'll stick to Polish baked goods for my poppy fix), the coupe Mozart (now THIS is what an ice cream sundae should look like!) and the apricot pistachio crepe (also insanely good and wonderfully presented). The highlight of their desserts is easily the ice cream, especially the nutty flavours.

On the savoury side, I've tried their veggie flatbread with artichokes and feta and it was tasty, but too smothered in oil for my tastes along with the salad (I really dislike it when veggies are greasy).

Can't wait to come again, either for more ice cream or sweet crepes."}
{"text":"We've been going here for dessert, coffee and the odd dinner for as long as I can remember. In fact, this place will always have a special little place in my heart because it is where I proposed to my wife (this review would have been positive even if she had said no). They have consistently good coffee and it is the only coffee I will drink at night because it is just that good, even though I know I won't be able to sleep. The taste is worth it.

On to the cakes. As soon as you walk in, there is an amazing display of all kinds of cakes right in front of you and IT CHANGES EVERY TIME! Fresh, European-inspired flavours are waiting for you. In addition, there is an extensive menu of other desserts such as crepes, ice cream, gelato, baked Alaska, etc.

Another thing to mention about The Apricot Tree is that the service is second to none. Many of the staff have been there for years and recognize our needs as a family with young kids (they never seat us too close to the door, they provide extra napkins assuming we will need them, etc.)

The cafe is decorated in such a way that it brings the outdoors in, giving the entire place an alfresco feel. A somewhat recent plus is the addition of a wheelchair accessible washroom on the main level. This makes a huge difference for many people I'm sure. The old bathrooms are down a long flight of stairs in the basement.

Before I forget, as of Jan 24 2016 they are now open on Sundays and they have an awesome Sunday brunch/all day breakfast menu. If you are in the area, you simply must check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot chocolate, hazelnut coffee and warm hazelnut cake. All three were mediocre to poor. The hot chocolate was watery, the luke warm coffee turned cold after 5mins and the cake arrived not looking like a cake but a strange hybrid of a molten lava cake and a brownie.... It was splattered with chocolate and vanilla syrup and strawberries. The bottom was already soggy from the chocolate syrup and upon breaking the cake it seemed like it was microwaved before it was served to us. Not very happy at all. 

This was our second visit here, our first was enjoyable with great service and optimal desserts (3 years ago). We found from our recent visit that the service was very slow, even though the place was completely empty. There were 4 groups of people in the restaurant with tonnes of empty seats. On top of that our waitress kept forgetting hints we needed: she never brought sugar for my coffee and I had to ask her twice for napkins.

Apricot Tree has lost its charm and its staff for that matter. Staff looked tired and over worked and sitting on cloud 9. The establishment needs a revamp."}
{"text":"It is a very small, crowded and noisy place to eat. We could barely understand the waitress when she was telling us the daily special because of her accent. The result was, she got annoyed when we keep asking her the same question.

My soup was lukewarm and the seafood pasta was loaded with black pepper and no good cook will do that.

We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Apricot Tree Cafe has been in business for as long as I can remember and every experience I've had there has been a pleasant one. It's not very big inside so it helps when the weather is nice and they open up the patio area.

I ordered the chicken flat bread with a house salad on the side. The flat bread has chicken, tomato and cheese melted all over the flat bread. There was a lot of cheese which made it very filling, I only ended up having half of the flat bread. The salad was well seasoned with a balsamic vinaigrette.

My sister had a warm salad. The concept sounded a little strange to me because I've only ever had a cold salad. The salad was made up of arugala, almond slivers, peppers and also dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. For a dish that was entirely vegetarian ( I usually like adding meat to my salads), it tasted so good. I'll definitely continue having warm salads in the future!

My mom ordered the chicken tarragon crepe. Crepes are definitely not just a dessert item anymore and if you go to a crepe restaurant they'll usually have an assortment of salty, sweet, cold and hot crepes. The chicken tarragon sauce was very creamy and blended well with the crepe. Like the flat bread, it can be be very filling with the cream sauce so it might be wise to share this dish as well. The crepe itself is very thing so that helps balance out the dish a little bit.

If my stomach has the space, I would love to finish off every meal with dessert. Apricot Tree Cafe is pretty famous for their Napoleon dessert. If you go later in the afternoon, chances are you won't be able to get a piece of their Napoleon because people come by and get it as take out. Even though it's made with cream, it doesn't taste very heavy and the cream itself is very fresh. The portion size is good as well. It's a little messy to eat because there are so many layers but don't let the hard work deter you from ordering a piece!

Overall, Apricot Tree Cafe is a great place to go if you are looking for something new to try in Mississauga. It can get quite busy around lunch time on the weekends so make sure you plan ahead and make a reservation. There isn't a lot of seating in the restaurant either so when it gets busy, it gets crowded and waiting for a table can be a hassle because there is nowhere to stand and wait.  If you aren't super hungry, try ordering a salad or splitting a meal with a friend because some of their dishes can be a bit heavy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint. We were served promptly and kindly. Eggs Benedict was a real winner. Coffee was good too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend bought a chocolate cake for his brother's birthday two weeks ago. It tasted delicious, so we decided to go back for more and try out their dinner menu. 

The server recommended the special 20th anniversary menu. We decided to give it a try since it is $34 + Tax for 3 courses, quite a decent deal. If you are looking for something unique to the taste bud, then no doubt this is the restaurant for you :) Unfortunately, this offer only lasts until tonight... 

Here's a list of our orders:
Apetitzers 
* Pumpkin Panna Cotta with Apple Rosti (Our Favorite...Highly recommended!)
* Pork Tenderloin with Aspik, Styrian Pumpkin Seed Oil and Wasabi

Main Courses
* Tafelspitz with Horseradish Risotto and Spinach Flan 
* Beef Tenderloin with Apricot Quark Cheese Tarte and Juniper Berry Chocolate Paint (Recommended!)

Dessert 
* Plum Dumplings with Carpe Diem Espuma
* Grape Strudel with Ice Wine Sabayone (Highly recommended!)

I hate the taste of pumpkin, but their Pumpkin Panna Cotta with Apple Rosti was absolutely heaven in the mouth. The flavor was bold and it gave a similar texture to foie gras. I can eat this all day. Their Beef Tenderloin was pretty good too. The beef was tender and it tasted quite funny with the berry chocolate sauce. 

Service was good. The servers were friendly and helpful. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Hahahaha.... no.

It's been a long time since I was this disappointed in a restaurant. I made the mistake of suggesting this place to eat at when I was out with my mother last week. We showed up to the place thinking it would be a cheap lunch option, but I did a double take when I saw how pricey the lunch items were. $20 for a sandwich? $25 and up for mains?

The restaurant itself was supposedly renovated fairly recently. If it was, I didn't notice. The place looks like a holdover from the mid-2000s. Sloppy looking seating, plain-looking tables and chairs and no real regard for anything else in particular. The \"smart\" waitress decided to sit us at a table located right beside the women's washroom. Are you kidding me?

By the time they came to us for drinks, we decided we'd had enough and walked. This is not the type of restaurant that should be charging gourmet rates for crepes and lunch items.

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for helping me find this place. 

What a lovely little cafe with great desserts. And from the looks of it a decent entree and even breakfast menu. 

Its open till late evening and has patio seating too. We shared a crepe Denmark which was very light  and tasty!

They have a great selection of drinks and coffees too!  Will definitely be back! !"}
{"text":"Nice little spot for lunch or a coffee/dessert.

I went today for lunch and had the Greek salad to start and the arctic char entree. The Greek salad had a raspberry vinegrette which was a little odd (I think it was just their regular mixed green salad topped with feta and olives) but it still tasted good. The arctic char was well cooked and tasted great. And this is coming from a guy that's not the biggest fan of fish.

My GF had the sweet potato and spinach soup to start and the veal cutlet entree. The soup was delicious and the veal, while a tad salty, was also very good. Portion sizes were good - so good in fact that we didn't have room to try one of their delicious looking desserts. Prices were decent as well."}
{"text":"Owned by an Austrian couple, the Apricot tree is a delight for any occasion and any time of the day. Infact, my family goes here ever Easter as a tradition. The food is fresh, meals exciting, flavours delicious and staff extremely attentive and friendly. Their desserts are to die for and all made in-house with fresh ingredients. I would recommend to try the white chocolate cake or the apple cheesecake. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I forgot if I chose to write it like a story or divide my post into sections. Since my feedback is quite short for this restaurant, I will not separate all my comments. I was told by my friends that the washroom is downstairs but that it is hella scary. I've read enough horror stories to stay away from creepy washrooms so I opted to use the handicap one (on the same floor). Not sure if any of you have a comment about that. I recently read a scary story on Annie69 and have been acting like a scaredy cat. Anyhow, restaurant is located in a very nice plaza. I have one complaint, there is an exit that opens to an inner street. I thought there would be another opening right beside it as I couldn't find a close enough parking spot, WRONG! Just don't leave the parking spaces, do a U-Turn within the narrow spaces if you have to lols.

My friends noted that the cakes here are amazing. I'm sorry to disappoint you readers but they were meh. The chocolate one was creamy, but the rest were too sweet for my liking. On the other hand, I was SUPER impressed by their pasta. I ordered their daily pasta and the sauce was so good. Creamy, flavourful, not too overwhelming, and big portions. I'm so glad I ordered the pasta and would totally recommend you to do the same. At the end, I could not finish it. I love it, honestly it tastes better than most pasta I've had in downtown Toronto. That's something that the restaurant can boast about"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's close to home, it's in a cozy, quaint plaza, and it has the potential to be a neighbourhood staple. Where do I even begin? We sat down hungry and excited to try the food and dessert. Ordered the trout and steak frites. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough. However, I noticed the water glasses smelled like they had been wiped down with a mouldy towel. Still, at that point I was enjoying the place. Then the food took a while to come out and when it did, a different waitress slammed my plate down with no apology... The trout and steamed veg tasted fine but the saffron rice was horrible and stale. I'm not a hugely picky eater and I like all rice. But this was inedible. All of us left the rice barely touched so I hope the kitchen got the message. To top it off, it's quite expensive for what you get. I've had more fulfilling meals at ikea for a fraction of the cost. I might give it one more try just because it is so close to home but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"TLDR: Good place, bit expensive, nice for special outings but perhaps not your everyday lunch option.

Location: Easy to find just west of Mississauga and Dundas. Always lots of parking since most of the little boutiques there don't get much traffic. 

Food: The first time that I was here, I got the Seafood Dill (or something along that line). It was really good to be honest, and not a bad value at $16 or so. Pretty filling, excellent sauce, and light on the gut. This time, they had a Schnitzel Fest (mid-August to mid-September); in addition to having a bunch of mostly meat entrees that they don't normally have in the $17-21 range, you could also pay $28 for one of those plus goulash / soup of the day and a dessert (choice of Apple Strudel, Linzer Torte, and some chocolate torte whose name I do not remember). A good value when you consider the value of that soup is $5 alone, and the dessert could be just as much if not more, so as long as you got something over $18, you were getting a good deal. It was a little peculiar that on the day that we were there (a Monday afternoon), they were out of both goulash (one of the two options for the soup on this Schnitzel Fest thing) and sweet potato fries... As far as the food goes, I got the Apricot Schnitzel with a Cream of Carrot with Curry Soup and the Linzer Torte. The schnitzel came with steamed veggies (zucchini, carrot, asparagus, some white root thing that frankly I have no idea what it was) and roasted potatoes, as well as an apricot cognac sauce on top. Soup was very flavourful, good texture (little gritty), and fairly filling. The meat was well-cooked (not deep-fried), and the potatoes were excellent. A minor critique is that some potatoes were harder and seemed a bit undercooked; this would not have been as noticeable if they were all of that consistent hardness. Steamed vegetables were well done, if not that flavourful. The apricot sauce is light and sweet but not overly so. That being said, I'm not sure that it was much of a complement either than perhaps to mask any potential dryness of the meat (a little but well done overall). The torte was alright. I don't typically eat fancy cakes, so let that stand as a disclaimer. I found it to be a bit dry and hard. The raspberry was relatively minor and not a dominant flavor. The sauce (which included three raspberry hearts...) was good and helped to mitigate some of that, but frankly the cake was so dense that it didn't even really soak up the sauce if you dragged it through. 

Price: Perhaps a bit steep. The presentation of the food is very good, but as with most expensive places, it's totally non-functional. Like putting the schnitzel on top of the potatoes was pointless because I had to take it off to eat anyway. The value of the raw ingredients for what I had (for the main course) couldn't have been anymore than $12 (pork cutlet + a few veggies and taters), but it was a $21 pricetag. That soup probably wasn't worth $5 either. I have no idea what was in that cake, so I can't comment on that. 

In my opinion, it is difficult for any place where an entree exceeds $18 (+/- $2) to get 5 stars because if I'm paying that much, it better be really good (exceptions include steakhouses). Certainly this is a good restaurant, and the food is pretty good, but as some others have noted, sometimes the flavours are too light to be memorable. It's like the difference between being just consistently above average and being great. Service is fine; our guy seemed pretty new, so he got confused about a few things; no biggie though. Also note that it can sometimes get a bit loud during peak hours."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Apricot since I was a student at UTM. Why do I go? It's simple: the coffee and the ice cream. I'm not a fan of Austrian desserts (the owner is Austrian, I believe). The service has only ever been so-so and the Apricot Tree doesn't appear to be the cleanest establishment (dirty walls, gross floors and nasty washrooms). Still for some great coffee and a scoop or two, it'll do!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl. This restaurant has a special charm to it. It may be the quality of food, the friendly service, or the wide selection of desserts, and it always has me coming back. 

My usual order is the shrimp and dill crepe. The portions are generous and the price is nothing but fair. What I also like as a small bonus is the bread served in the beginning not just with butter, but with olive spread. And given the olive gal that I am, I love every bite of it. 

If you're into cakes and pastries you're in for a treat. The display area with all the desserts will make you want to order everything and this is before you lay eyes on the gelato selection. For dessert I usually order the chocolate pecan tart, and on the rare occasion when available the white chocolate raspberry pie. Mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday around 11:50am, ordered a Tuna wrap, two pieces of cakes and ice cream. 

The seating is quick, the waitress is nice, BUT, everything is SO slow!

I went to the counter to order the cake, there were 5 waitresses but no one had a second to take the order. Everyone walked around seemed busy but I didn't think it was efficient. Another lady like me was waiting to order the cake, we'd waited 15 minutes at least, when I backed to my table, waited another 20 minutes for my wrap and dessert!

After finishing the food, again, 10 minutes waiting for the bill.

Overall I like this place, just took too long for everything, otherwise I would've given higher rating for sure. It's a good place to practice your patience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Apricot Tree for an early dinner last night and we've both enjoyed it there in the recent past. Last night however, I was disappointed in the portions - especially my warm salad dinner special that included italian sausage...The sausage had been cut up into small pieces and I would be surprised if I had even a half sausage in my salad. My husband enjoyed his crepe. We had grilled calamari and smoked salmon as appetizers. The grilled calamari's sesame dressing was pretty good but I could taste sugar in every bite (too sweet). The smoked salmon dish was good but I wish the portions of ingredients were better distributed. We arrived there at 5pm so the restaurant was not busy but the service was still slow. We won't be as eager to return here."}
{"text":"Really great café vibe. Had a delicious salad and decided to indulge in a couple of deserts, it was hard to decide everything looked so good! The wait staff was phenomenal, making sure I had everything I needed quickly and professionally. Highly recommended for a quick meal or a family dinner."}
{"text":"We recently had brunch here on a Saturday afternoon. We had made a 1:00 pm reservation and arrived a few minutes early.  We were sat upon our arrival and left with our menus for 20 minutes before we asked a passing Server if someone was going to take our order. 

The younger lady arrived and took our order - she was obviously very flustered.  About 40 minutes later we again had to ask for our coffee to be refreshed and the Server confirmed our food order.  When the food finally arrived the order was not correct; however, after having waited over an hour for our food I just wanted to eat.

Overall the food was satisfactory; however, i would not return based on their poor service."}
{"text":"Dinner for four at Apricot Tree was awesome.

FOOD:  A-
Not a top notch food place, but very reasonable price for almost top notch food.  Tonight they had a lobster menu with lobster pasta, lobster this and that, and they were all good.  My wife had the salmon pasta and she loved it. Strawberry Napoleon was very good, and good size.  The bread they served before dinner was D+.   They really should look in to finding a better bread.  The bread served before meal sets the tone for rest of the meal and is the first impression. 

SERVICE:  A
Very attentive, without coming around too frequently.

Overall: A-
What is not to like about this place.  Great desert, good food, and good service.  At this price range, I have to say this place is fairly top notch.  Dinner for 4 with deserts, and appetizer came out about $115.    I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Went here today and was incredibly disappointed by the lack of service. The food was good but unless you're the more mature retired clientele they will completely ignore you. We sat down for 8 minutes before we got fed up and had to ask for a menu. Figured out what we wanted and closed our menu and then had to wait for the waitress to pass by us three times before she realized we wanted to order something. Once we did order I noticed that all the other tables had bread baskets and water but they didn't bother even offering it and we had already put in our coffee order. Waitress dropped off our meal and we never saw her again. A different server was the one who brought us our cheque. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone since if I'm paying $14 for a crepe and then pay for coffee refills I would expect some sort of minimal service"}
{"text":"Based on numerous reviews online, we decided to give this place a try. The menu looked enticing, and the prices didn't look too bad.

The location of the café is quite cute and adorable, with foliage and vines surrounding the courtyard environment. Walking into the café, it was already pretty busy (as we arrived around 7pm or so) and dimly lit. Since there was only 1 table for 2 available that was so close to the next tables, we opted to sit out on the patio.

We decided to split the Seafood Pasta, and the Sweet Potato, Spinach, and Rosemary Soup. The soup was quite nice and had a nice aroma. The bread that we were given initially was tasty too. Almost like a crostini, but a lot flakier. I'd prefer it to be less salty, but it wasn't too bad. Then our entrée came, and though the amount of seafood given was very generous, it was drenched in too much olive oil. I understand that the dish was supposed to have olive oil in it already, but in all honesty, it didn't need to have THAT much oil. But overall, the food was okay, not bad.

Where the evening turned south was with the service. Our server was not attentive, and she seemed like she was preoccupied. It took her over 30 minutes between segments to get our order, give our order, pick up our order, and she forgot to bring us our bill. We had been there for over 2 1/2 hours, and eventually gave up and got up and went inside to just pay the bill at the counter. We wanted dessert, but given her pace, we had to pass.

Overall, I think the place itself is quite cute, but with the slow service and just mediocre food, I won't be going back the next time I'm in town. I really wanted to like the place, but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"It's one of those restaurants where I realize a non-franchise (although they do have sister restaurants) doesn't naturally mean good ole fresh, home made family cooking. 

BF and I have been here a few times, their wine list and desserts look great. 

This review is for their food items. We've tried their schnitzel, pastas, salads, crepes (dessert/savoury), baked mussels, french onion soup and bread. 

I can say all of them looked great in presentation but none tasted fresh or wow. There was so much hope for this cute local favorite with a European feel and taste but unfortunately the food was just mediocre. It's seems cafeteria assembled if that makes sense. 

Service is always amazing though! I'd definitely go back for just dessert/tea/drinks, but just not for food."}

I haven't been here in quite some time, but my friend just got back in town and we were looking to catch up and get some dessert.

I had the lemon strawberry crepe and tasted a bit of the sorbet platter. The sorbet tasted almost like the fruit. It was almost like eating the fruit itself. I had just eaten food prior so this was a little bit much. The crepe was good the lemon and white chocolate cream was delicious. It was not too sour, but I think the choice of pairing it with the raspberry sorbet could have been done with something less tart to balance out the dish. The sorbet platter was also good, but the meringues underneath were just a bit too much sugar. There was something clearly missing in that combination.

For $7.50-$8.50 for the crepes and under $7 for the ice cream, this is not that bad. 

What used to be a relatively small and cramped spot has evolved into a much more spacious restaurant.

Being out on the west end, there aren't many options to go for decent dessert. Still, this is a nice spot to go for a crepe or cakes. I'd recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant and is much more roomy now that it has been renovated.  I am not sure why it does not have a higher Yelp review.  The food here is always fresh and tasty, and the staff are always friendly and accommodating. We have been coming here for years, and it never disappoints. My mom and I came here for dinner and both really enjoyed our dinners. We both had the lobster bisque as a starter. It was rich and full of lobster flavour. My mom had the chicken tarragon crepe, which is always fabulous; and I had the crepe special: beef with sugar snap peas, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in a rose sauce. It was delicious!  The chef always manages to put together combinations that are unusual but super tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I didn't have a review of Apricot Tree yet considering I've been coming here every year for my Birthday since highschool! They are the perfect little tucked away gem in a cute shopping complex with one of a kind shops. The inside is cozy and inoffensive style, very simple. 
They are well known for their amazing desserts but I come for one thing, the tarragon crepe. You need to eat the tarragon crepe, like immediately. You can get it without meat and they will stuff it full of zucchini, mushroom, cauliflower, carrots and snow peas. The sauce is to die for, it's rich and flavorful and once you have it I don't see how you cannot order it every time. The dish comes with a nice salad and you can choose to change it to one other than the spring mix. 
To drink they have an apricot beer that is really fantastic and very fruity, I got a mimosa this time for my birthday and it was fab. We had a cappuccino with dessert and it was great, super frothy and smooth espresso.
For dessert we shared the Dark chocolate raspberry tart which was amazing, not overly sweet lots of berries. My friends got different crepes and all really enjoyed them. 
The staff is also nice, perfectly attentive aka they don't interrupt every five minutes to see how you're doing (which drives me nuts). 
I love this place and everyone that I know that has been has agreed with me."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in Erindale. Friendly staff & worth the drive if you're craving for some amazing savoury crêpes! We had the french onion soup, Tafelspitz Mac & Cheese, Savoury Crêpe of the day (chicken,mushroom,zucchinni,rose sauce), and their Lemon Strawberry crêpe. The dishes may look simple, but they all tasted amazing (my tastebuds were raving for more)!! The Apricot Tree is great for family gatherings their wide menu selection with  French, Italian, and Canadian styled food. I admire chefs who explore with diversity in their cooking culture, as well as, creating every dish with passion and this place done everything right! I don't live in the area, but o would still come back to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for lunch. Okay service and speed, but nothing special. It was a clean place and many people came in to check out the desserts.

The food was ok and good price. Apparently they recently added a side of fries to the menu because you could only get salad previously. I found a decent amount lobster shells in my lobster wrap, which spoiled the experience. In a restaurant, service may vary, but questionable food preparation makes the restaurant, well, questionable... I was given the bill, and after I paid cash, they added another item to the bill without explanation along with the change, which was strange."}
{"text":"I knew this place existed back when I was living in Missisauga but forgotten about it till my friend suggested we go there for brunch. A little bit disappointed with this place. Service was slow and food took too long to come (35+ minutes)..food was just average or maybe I didn't know what should I be ordering. My friend had also wanted to order the quiche to share but they said it couldn't be ordered to eat at the dining room....also there was a 50% off on all pastries cakes and desserts today but the waitress never bother informing us about this awesome promo  we only found about it as we were leaving when the people coming in mentions about how this place is so busy today cuz of their promotion!  Everything was almost sold out by then.  I did go back to buy a piece ot apple strudel but they still charged me full price! Perhaps dinner might be a better experience but not in a hurry to visit back this place any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, not specifically because of the food but because of the owner, and older gentleman. Firstly, I caught him berating one of his staff members to the point of tears. His entire staff appears scared of him. There's a lot of mold in the bathroom as well. The food itself is nothing special."}
{"text":"Service was pretty abysmal. It wasn't overly busy, and the waitress seemed to have zero interest in our table. Went for 'crepe fest', I recommend to pass on all the savoury crepes - they are overpriced and underfilled. Dessert crepes were good, but I wouldn't return for just those. I can see this being a lunch spot, but I came for dinner and had dinner expectations."}
{"text":"If you want to escape franchises that seem to be plaguing the restaurant landscape of suburbia (I'm looking at you Moxies, Jack Astors, Kelsey's, etc.), I'd recommend popping by The Apricot Tree on Dundas/Erin Mills Parkway.

If you can tolerate the kitschy ambiance, the food is quite good and moderately priced. It's always a safe bet to go with the soups of the day (as I think soups and salads are their core competency). I'd definitely recommend pairing a soup with the salad topped with warm mushrooms (#nommy). The service is decent as well!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Apricot Tree for years, and every time I visit, I ask myself why I don't go here more often than just a few times a year. I love their food and their daily, inventive specials. Last night I tried their lamb crepe, which really hit the spot on a cool winter night. The lamb was mixed in with a ragout, curry sauce. The added touch of apples really brought out the flavours. 
The waiter was so nice, courteous and attentive. 
In the past I've tried a variety of their pasta specials -- all were delicious. The warm salads are also great when you want something a little lighter."}
{"text":"I've been to this place after a group run a number of times for coffee and muffin a year ago.  The coffee was fresh and strong while the muffin were always great.  So last Friday I took my wife for desserts after we had lunch somewhere else.  The dessert and coffee were reasonably priced but the service was a fail.  Today we decided to have lunch.  I had the steak and frite and my wife had pasta with salmon.   In both times, we were seated at the front of the restaurant.  Huge mistake, I hate being able to hear other people's conversation because of the close proximity to my table.  Second the service here is shit.  I had this short male bearded millennial who took our order and was never seen again after that.  We ate our lunch as fast as we could and paid at the front because I was extremely disappointed at the way we were looked after.  If you can even call it that!  I still left a 10% tip even though I was completely annoyed with this mediocre mf!  The food here is good but after experiencing two lousy servers on two recent visits I'm done with this place.  I was hoping we would have the same girls to serve us that used to take care of my running group but no luck this time.  They were not there anymore and only have these two very inhospitable and dense caricatures."}
{"text":"Super cute place to go! 
I love how this place is a lovely coffee shop. 
It was a pleasant surprise that they also have a full breakfast and lunch menu. 
Their desserts were fabulous and each one was different and delicious! 
People can come for a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and enjoy the warm and friendly environment. The staff was great and very friendly.

It was a pleasant surprise! I did not know what to expect when I came here. 
I was hoping for a sweet little shoppe and it's exactly that! 
Skip Starbucks if your looking for a coffee shoppe, this place is much better!"}
{"text":"We came here on the late sat night.  This small cafe was packed with people having desserts. 
The waitress is busy but very friendly. 
We had the beef crepe, Wiener Schnitzel, and french onion soup. The crepe is excellent, light and fluffy. The sauce is a little too salty to my tasting. 
Love the Wiener Schnitzel. The fried pork chop is tender and goes really well with the mushroom sauce. 
We got a Toblerone Chocolate Mousse and that is delightful. 
Would def. go back again for more dessert!!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot in Mississauga. Everything is delicious, from the bread in the bread basket to the last bite of dessert. My favorite thing here is the signature apricot salad (one of the best salads I've ever had). The soups are also always good, as are the pastas, and crepes. Dessert here is a must! The raspberry white chocolate tart is beyond words."}
{"text":"Decided to choose this spot to host a brunch with some friends as it was local and listed as a brunch spot. 

Place is okay looking in its decor, nothing fancy.. Menu was very small in its selection. Waitresses seemed lost and or lost in trying to make small talk. They were very polite though, just didn't seem like they knew how to make small talk. 

They were not attentive at all.. we had to wait for everything... drinks, our food and our bill. They never checked in on us while we were eating. This was a group of twelve so we definitely needed checking in on..

Let's get to the food, I did not enjoy my food at all. I ordered a apricot salad with a chicken breast., my chicken breast was one third of an average chicken breast. The salad was lacking in flavour and I only received one piece of tomato. It was terrible.

The other girls seemed to like their food but they said that their was nothing special about it. The salmon that my friend ordered that's in the picture only ate the top of it and left the rest.

I ordered a cranberry juice and asked for it with ice but received no ice. I'm really easygoing so I didn't complain. For me the two stars was because of the lack of attentiveness and lack of flavour in the food.

Food needs and facelift as the dishes are very dead in their presentation and flavour.


I would not come back here again.."}
{"text":"The Bad Reviews Are Not That Wrong

Overall The Apricot Tree is a decent place for socializing while having a (heavily baking influenced) meal. However it seems to be a place that would get better the more you go. Knowing the people who work there might get you a better table, better service and a better choice of menu items. It appears that you can also make reservations and ask for a specific table.

However your first visit may not be unlike some of the low rating reviews you may have read. There are some annoyances that you may overlook if you don't care. When they ask you to \"sit at any two-person\" table (except the reserved one by the window or a table for four) and you later see one person sitting alone at a table for four, you know that being a regular does have it's perks.

Being primarily a baked goods café with some lunch and dinner menu items, the deserts tend to be better than the dishes. The Fettucine pasta special with Shrimps, Mushrooms, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Snow Peas and Cauliflower in a Tarragon Cream Sauce, was borderline terrible with overcooked pasta, slathered in a cream sauce with snow peas and large pieces of sun-dried tomatoes. The Shrimp saved the plate. The crepes seems to be a favorite and chicken, mushrooms, cauliflower and tarragon sauce seem to be the preferred ingredients of the day.

Check out The Apricot Tree for a coffee or tea and a desert and get a feeling for the menu and the environment. However, if you take soy milk with your latter you will be disappointed. I would suggest Apricot invest in a stronger ventilation system as the air was a little thick with crepe fumes. The service we received from Sam was awesome...very humble and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for my cousin's bridal shower. There were about 15 of us sitting out on the patio. When it started to lightly drizzle, they offered us a table inside. I know how annoying it must've been to move a large group around, so I appreciated that! Service was really pleasant and friendly throughout.

I was really happy with my food and drink as well. I really wanted a crêpe, but there was a daily special sandwich whose ingredients (smoked salmon, arugula, capers, goat cheese) were speaking to my soul... So, I asked to substitute the bread for a crêpe, and our server assured me that it wouldn't be a problem. It came out PERFECTLY. So delicious. Paired with a strawberry smoothie, I was in heaven.

It's a bit tiny inside, and the decor is a bit outdated, but it's charming. Great food, service, and ambiance :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea why The Apricot Tree got such high reviews. A friend of ours suggested this cafe to hangout over some dessert. 

The dessert menu is very lacking. I assumed they would have more dessert options. Nothing stood out to me so I just decided to get a banana split. The other three ordered cake. The banana split was very disappointing because there were barely any strawberries in it. The two friends who got the neopolitan cake didn't really enjoy it. They said the top layer was hard so it was hard to cut through the cake. Also, the top layer was overly sweet.

Our server was friendly during our short visit. I don't see myself coming back as I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"I have been going to The Apricot Tree regularly for the past 15 years, pretty much since it opened (back when it was in this tiny space and mostly served only desserts and coffee). It's located in a small, upscale shopping plaza in Mississauga's west end (Sherwood Forest). 
They are famous for their desserts. To this day, they are my gold standard for tiramisu. Other favourites are the mango mousse and various cheesecakes. They also make their own ice cream on the premises and do wonderful crepes (every year around March they have a crepe festival featuring savory and sweet selections). Around Christmas, you can buy cookies or gingerbread houses as gifts.
But there is a lot more to the Apricot Tree than their desserts. The owners are a husband-wife team. Franz makes all the desserts and his wife, Esther, is in charge of the soups/salads/pasta/etc. There are always daily specials to keep things interesting and lots of fresh, healthy options. Warm salads are solid, as are the various pasta dishes. Schnitzel is another staple, going with the Austrian vibe. Really, it's hard to go wrong here. Even now that I live in Toronto, I still come back to the Apricot Tree because I have yet to find another place that is so reliably good and reasonably priced. For instance, during the crepe festival, I had a 3 course meal (soup, crepe main, crepe dessert + strawberry tea) for $22.50!! 
I should declare a conflict of interest -- I worked at the Apricot Tree for a year when I was in high school. However, I dined their regularly before and after I worked there. And having worked behind the scenes, I can only say good things in terms of the freshness of the food and the quality of the ingredients."}
{"text":"So normally, I plan to write reviews shortly after I have visited a place.  However, the Apricot Tree is such a hidden gem, I had to add my two cents right now.  

The Apricot Tree is a quite ordinary looking cafe that is pretty basic on the decor.  It has a limited menu when it comes to main courses and beverages.  However, the food is amazing, the service is solid, the prices are reasonable and as good as the main courses are, the real standouts at the Apricot Tree are the desserts.  

The owner, Franz, is a master pastry chef trained in Austria.  If you are tired of chocolate-bar cakes shipped in frozen from central commissaries, give the cafe a try and get ready for a flavour explosion.  Apricot Strudel is probably their signature dessert, but they have crepes, handmade ice cream, cheesecakes, mousses and more.  I have too many favourites to list.  I enjoy everything from the healthy simplicity of the berry bowl mulled in red wine and cinnamon to the apple cheesecake to the baked Alaska.  They have their menu online if you want to see more.

The cafe can be busy and they have shorter hours than many places -- closed on Sundays.  I recommend going your first time in the middle of the afternoon, so the staff will have lots of time to tell you all about all the cakes and strudals at their sinful pastry counter.

Anybody I have ever taken to the Apricot Tree has loved it (and I have taken many there).  Not only is it more than worth a visit, it is worth a long-drive to get there.  

While I am more likely to review a place I liked than one I did not, please know that  I am not one to rave lightly.  The food at the Apricot Tree is absolutely top notch -- perhaps only beaten by the very most expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"***TIP:  For a better dining experience, try to get a seat on the inside of the restaurant, behind the counter.***

Just thought that I'd update my review as it's been a while since I've been to this Mississauga institution, Apricot Tree!

Apricot Tree is great for dessert, a coffee, &/or even a meal with a European flare.  Portions and prices are more than fair and I believe that these 2 things have contributed to their continued success over the decades.

During my visit on Saturday evening, the complimentary bread wasn't the best.  In fact, it was a bit on the stale-tasting side.  And, maybe I'm an old school patron, but I remember the service being much, much better.  On this visit, I felt as though some details were lacking, missing side dish, a friend asked for a straw and it came much later, asking for water to be refilled, the handheld debit/credit machine was dropped on the floor, overall not a very refined atmosphere.

If service could match the food, that would just further elevate this café - especially since they're expanding to the unit next door and I'm assuming, hoping to expand their clientele!"}
{"text":"I got takeout and when I arrived to pick it up I did not regret it. This place lacks the atmosphere I expected when I looked at their menu.
I had the braised short ribs which were fine. Pretty tender as a previous reviewer said but I've had much better in terms of flavour. 
I got a slice of passion fruit mousse cake for dessert and it was extremely old and dried out... I literally could not eat the side or top parts they were so old. Even on the inside, the mousse did not have exceptional taste or flavour. After all I had read about the apricot cafe on yelp, especially about their desserts, I was surprised that my experience was not that great. 
Because I have heard good things, I might return for a dessert crepe at some point and see if that changes my mind."}
{"text":"Apricot Tree, haven't been back since 7 years (partially because I don't live near the place, nor does the name pop up in my mind).  Looks like they're still just as strong as they were.

Went with a couple of friends, for a snack/dessert, love the atmosphere of the environment, very spacious and contemporary.  Their main known dishes revolve around their crepes (at least from the last time I went 7 years ago), so that's exactly what we bought.  Two crepes, the Denmark and the Tutti Frutti.

Both of them were excellent, crepes were light, not overly sweet and the ice cream scoops we selected were delicious.  On the Denmark, we had the Pistachio and Apricot Ginger ice cream, both with great flavour.  The Apricot Ginger flavour surprised me with the unexpected pink-ish colour, when I was expecting a bit more orange colour.  Generally a lot of crepe places can be way too sugary but the balance on both crepes was perfect.

I would only say the slightly negative part of this is probably the service, but it's pretty minor.  The waitress, not sure if understaffed but they're not very attentive and require flagging down to get the bill or get more water/coffee.  But again, it's a minor complaint, but it does need some mentioning.

Overall, enjoyable place, great desserts, unfortunately couldn't try the entrees, so this isn't really a full review of this place."}
{"text":"I had the sweet potato & leek soup which was good. Followed it up with duck and salad which I thought was very well done and the flavours of the salad were cool. Shared a cup of loose leaf tea with my friend and that was a nice finish. Friends had the crepe and they felt a sugar rush though. Service was slow but then there was only 1 waiter working - so he forgot about the tea. Not bad - will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Cutiesh little place, absolutely designed for kids. But not too big a crowds of these - it is quite \"cozy\" inside, and parking is tiny and packed, too.

Lots of girlie and kiddie food, not that much for adult, meat-eating guys. Quality of my plate was not exciting at all - though my wife said that her sweet stuff was good.

Service was neither excessively polite, nor too attentive - we were not impressed.

Could be acceptable to go with kids maybe once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"It's weird that this place has gotten such great reviews when in all honesty the 4 times I've been here I haven't liked any of my meals.  2 of the meals were sandwiches, and they were watery aka the bread was soggy.  Old? Or just a lot of water/mayo?"}
{"text":"We've been visiting The Apricot Tree for many years, so I figured it was about time for a review.

First and foremost, this restaurant is wonderful for desserts as it's owned by a pastry chef. The desserts are mostly European-style such as strudels, Napoleons, etc.. They are always beautifully presented with a sauce or coulis and dusted with icing sugar or cocoa. I don't eat a lot of dessert, but everyone I've dined with who has ordered one has raved about it. They also have a gelato bar for those who don't want pastries.

The interior is a little small and it gets very busy, so it's a good idea to make a reservation. During the summer months, they open up a patio area at the back. 

The service is always very friendly, but can be a little bit slow. 

My favourite item on the menu is the chicken and tarragon crepe. It's served with a cream sauce and is honestly one of the nicest things I've ever tasted. There are daily specials, so there are often other kinds of crepes and I've never had one that wasn't wonderful. 
Other delicious menu/daily speicals items are the quiches, the warm salads, pastas, fish dishes and the list just goes on. I've never had a bad meal here.

I visited The Apricot Tree today with 5 friends and after eating, I asked them to rate the restaurant out of 5 stars. I got two 4s and three 5s. I think that says it all :)"}
{"text":"This is a well established restaurant serving up brunch, Austrian influenced dinners, and a lot of great desserts.  I really want to give this a higher rating as the food does taste good, desserts are excellent, and the servers are overwhelmed but the kitchen pacing and incredibly odd kitchen delivery was truly sub-par.  If you're here just for their cakes, it's a good solid 4 Star... but don't expect good service unfortunately.

On a Sunday brunch time, this place was quite full with at least 90% of the tables filled.  I do recommend reservations if you try to come here during brunch.  It is a small space (before their reno) and quaint.  The tables are quite close together so not only are you sharing seating space, you're also sharing you're conversation... just FYI.

They have a limited brunch menu which touches more on the savoury than sweet.  You have everything from Eggs Benedict, omelettes, sandwiches, and a few crepes.  They do have specials which has a pasta, soup, warm salad, and 2 entrees.  The prices are fair... most items are sitting around $9 and a few bigger items like the entrees are $18.  Most of us found an item to try.

The concern is the kitchen service... the wait staff is harried and stressed.  It's really obvious on their face as they all look like they're going to have a heart attack shortly.  It takes a while to gain anyone's attention to order ... even MUCH longer to get your food.  Though you do get some pieces of bread for the wait, it took over 40 minutes to get our dishes.  The sad fact was that a table of 2 sat AFTER us and they got their dishes before us by at least 10 minutes.  This was incredibly disappointing to see. I can't blame the wait staff for delivering non-existent food badly or slowly.  Their kitchen service is their problem.

As for the tastes, it wasn't bad ... thats the sad part.  They may not be terrible cooks but they don't know how to cook en masse for a restaurant.  I had the soup and warm salad. I enjoyed it... they were generous with the cheese and portions.  

As for the desserts, they were wonderful... don't order from the dessert menu but instead walk up to the glass enclosure of sugary delights.  Apple strudel is rife with tons of apples, raisins, and hazelnuts with a nice crispy phyllo crust.  Their Toblerone Mousse cake is one of their most popular and deservingly so... a nice chocolate sponge cake topped with 3 types of chocolate mousse (white, milk and dark).  It's not overly sweet and very creamy.

We picked up a box of their florentines... these are quite amazing.  A nice soft cookie base then topped with apricot preserves, a few spices and tons of sliced almonds with lots of caramel.  To top it off,  dipped in dark chocolate.  

I wish I could give it 4 stars... I'm hoping with their new renos, they have a larger kitchen AND more people to run it... or at least someone who knows how to run a restaurant kitchen."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 12 on the long weekend.  I called ahead for a table and the staff was friendly on the phone. The atmosphere so nice and an older clientele. Lots of seating for small or large groups. They have nice desserts and cakes at tje front counter.
 We ordered off the lunch menu and the chef was kind enough to make me scrammbled eggs even though the breakfast menu was over. The waitress was so nice and accommodating. I would love to come back for the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Happy 25th Anniversary! There's a different special every month this summer, and this morning I went for breakfast with the kids. June's promo is 2 breakfasts, coffee and 1 slice of cake for $25 (be sure to sign up for their email club as they'll ask to see the voucher). We ordered the schnitzel (comes with 2 eggs, potato rosti, sauerkraut and fruits), their signature crepes (shrimp and dill, and chicken terragon). The schnitzel was a bit burnt today, but was still enjoyable. At $12, I would definitely go back for that hearty breakfast. The crepes are always flavourful and saucy. The cake selection was a bit sad, as most cakes only had 1 slice leftover. The pecan cake was super nutty and packed with pecans and the peach mousse cake was light and not too sweet. My only complaint was the wait time for the food - even though there were only a few tables this morning, it took way too long to get our food."}
{"text":"My poor rating for this restaurant was based mainly on the service...although the food wasn't that great either.
First of all, I loved the location and look of this place. It's located in this small but really fancy looking plaza- very unique.
I went on a weekend for lunch but did not make any reservations, so upon arrival we got the last table available, which was right by the front door. The interior was well decorated and I can imagine that it would be even better during the summer when the patio would be open.
So basically, we were not getting service AT ALL. We waited for almost 10 minutes until I had to call someone myself. I asked for water and the menu, which didn't arrive until I had to ask several times after (around 4 times).
Later, a lady came up to take our order. She didn't seem very friendly, as she took down our order without a smile on her face or any sort of recommendations.
I asked for the smoked salmon warm salad. The rest ordered the vegetable sandwich. While waiting they brought a complimentary bread basket to the table, which consisted of warm olive bread. It wasn't the best olive bread I've had but I did enjoy it, mainly because I was starving.
The food arrived in a timely manner but my salad was a tiny portion size and was pretty gross. It was soggy warm salad...which I should've expected as 'warm' was what they described the food would be, but I did not assume the 'warm' description would indicate soggy, wilted salad, with warm smoked salmon! I think smoked salmon should always be served chilled!!
The sandwiches were overflowing and looked odd to me, as they looked more like bread dumped with vegetables.
I think if I were to visit again, I will stick to the desserts and coffee, which looked good from their display case and had a lot of demand based on the people walking in just to buy cakes and pastries.
Also, I would suggest making a reservation if you were to ever go."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends for a nice casual outing. The restaurant has a very great casual atmosphere and have great gelato options. I had the schnitzel here, which is usually made of pork, but I requested to have it made as a chicken schnitzel and they were able to do that. The customer service was great and would come back here. Parking is available easily around the plaza."}
{"text":"So I've recently heard about the renovation/expansion just few days ago. My boyfriend and I checked out the coffee menu before coming here so we were confused about the condensed drink menu (comparing to what I saw), since there were no \"speciality coffee\" section in that menu.
I'm glad the server caught on to that and the manager gave him an approval of making us the speciality coffee. If you like the taste of alcohol and coffee, I will 100% recommend the Spanish coffee or B52. 
I would definitely come back to try more speciality coffee and maybe try their desserts next time. 
 PS: BRING THE SPECIALITY COFFEE BACK ON THE MENU!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch and we were happy that we didn't have to wait in line. It did get pretty busy by the time we left around 11:45 am. It was a bit tricky to find this place in a round plaza as the front doors are not that visible from the parking area. 

We got to choose a table which was nice as we wanted some privacy. Our wall was painted with apricot tree branches which was a nice touch, due to the restaurant's name. 

Our waitress was friendly and understanding. She even split the dessert to our surprise. So we each got our portion of coconut crepe. Nice! 

My partner loved his salmon egg Benedict which came with some potatoes and a fruit bowl. For $10, it was definitely worth it. I got a chicken wrap with house salad. The chicken was on the dry side, but I'm glad the wrap was grilled. Nothing big on the salad. 

The dessert, I found had to much chocolate syrup to my liking. The coconut ice cream was divine. 

Issue: for such a large restaurant, I was surprised there's only one female washroom. Not ideal!! 

Verdict: We would love to go back for lunch or dinner. And celebrate another event in our lives. It was a great start to our Sunday morning before our mini trip out of town."}
{"text":"Average food.  Poor customer service.  Feels like they were not happy having you in.   Common people you can give us a  little smile."}
{"text":"I'm very glad to have found a nice crepe place in Mississauga. A number of people have told me about this place and I finally got to experience it for myself. This cafe is rather small (although if you go downstairs to use the washrooms, you'll be reminded of the TARDIS from doctor who - the place is much bigger on the lower floor than the upper floor!) and it fills up quickly.  I had the chicken tarragon crepes in white wine sauce which were fantastic. They also have quite the incredible dessert selection. It was a tough choice, but I went with the toblerone chocolate mouse cake for dessert. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Small, friendly cafe providing great service. Food and dessert is on point, however the coffee is subpar in my opinion. They also don't have the greatest variety/quality of speciality drinks."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, happy and engaged staff, the food was presented well, and was above average. I would recommend this place for dinner, and will be back again."}
{"text":"Hmmm... not sure the recent slew of negative reviews were deserved.

I just came back for a birthday dinner with my sister, and brother-in-law, and we had a fantastic dining experience. 

We weren't in a rush, so the relaxed pace of service was fitting. Whenever we did need assistance, it came swiftly and attentively. Our server, Arslan, was patient and helpful, attending to all our questions and special requests.

As it was a special occasion, we went for the 3-Course Special: choice of salad, main, dessert and coffee - all for $35! And they were very accommodating with our requests for swapping options.

Everything we ate that night was phenomenal - great ingredients, portions and flavour. The meal started with complimentary amuse bouche of smoked salmon on salsa and basil. Then I had the goat cheese brûlée salad, lamb shank on garlic mash & veggies, and the dark chocolate pecan tart/pie. Others at my table also had the french onion soup, apricot salad, beef brisket, hazelnut meringue cake (tastes like a Ferraro Rocher in cake form), and the (ever flaky, light an delicious) poppyseed cranberry cheesecake/strudel. Everything was top notch. We were fully satisfied and even excited to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

This place continues to be one of our favourites! Highly recommend Apricot Tree."}
{"text":"The food was great.... but the service was the slowest service ever. Our server was VERY nice but seemed like a deer in headlights for the entire time we were there. Several other tables around us being served by other staff turned around before we got our food. We had to ask for bread, ask for menus, ask for specials etc. Everything was unnecessarily slow and she seemed very confused the whole time.
Very unfortunate as the food was amazing. I ordered the Jambalaya Crêpe and it was sooo delicious! I might try again hoping I get a different server just to try more of the food."}
{"text":"Chicken pineapple curry is a must try, drink, main and desert get them all. The portions are smaller than average but it okay when there so many favors you want to try!"}
