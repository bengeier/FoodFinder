{"text":"This place is amazeballs!!!!!!  My husband and I have been here a few times and we are never disappointed!  Each time we sat at the bar and each time our bartender was very attentive and friendly.  They explained the menu, how things are prepared, what they liked the most, what people seemed to like the most...etc....  I only wish I could remember their names so they could get the praise they deserve:)  Our favorites are the Jakalope Meatloaf, the Roasted Chili Glazed Wings, and the Bison Americana.  Oh yeah, they have awesome TV's so you can catch your favorite game too:)  Long live Wild Game Grill:)"}
{"text":"Awesome Hot Honey and Hoppy wings! Great atmosphere and great service. Great value and great prices. I'm so happy right now!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Had my son's 18th Birthday party there. And my family love the food. The smoked wigs and hunters Nachos are awesome. Love the kids play area. My grandson enjoyed kids area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a sports bar to enjoy a beer, bite, and football before heading to the airport. This place hit the spot. I enjoyed the happy hour beer price with a nice wild game brat. As for the football, the tv and audio is set up well. An added bonus are all the outlets and USB charges throughout the place.  Already recommended it to others and I'll be back.   One note, plenty of parking in back where the main entrance can be found."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat or just hang out! The exotic items on the menu make this a unique restaurant, and the ones we had (kangaroo cabbage rolls with yogurt sauce, and wild boar and pork carnitas tacos) were tasty and we'll-prepared. We really appreciated the excellent service, including ensuring we could watch our sporting event on the biggest screen!"}
{"text":"Travel every week. Multi city warrior. Dropped in to watch the game. For real. .. best experience between ATL and San Diego. The namesake is for real, owners involved..., wings, among other items,  are off the charts (they smoke their wings daily and make ingredients in-house). Ever-changing menu with top quality 'game' options (elk, bison, rabbit, variety of bacons, etc)... (foodies... eat here). Great drink selection, excellent service,  very good prices... elite traveler says yes."}
{"text":"Good place. Came at 11 on a Saturday and it was empty.  Good food and service.  We plan on coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great bar! Atmosphere is awesome, staff is friendly. Owner of the bar out shaking hands and ensuring great service. You have to try the chili glazed wings! Best wings in town!"}
{"text":"When we got there the place was empty and I found it amusing there were more TVs than people in the place. The food was kind of bland and over cooked but still perfectly edible and the portions were large enough. I think they just need a few more weeks to get used to being open and refine their menu a little bit!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection! Food was good; the wings were tasty and actually had a lot of meat. I had the maple old fashioned and fell in love with it. I docked two stars because it's supposed to be a sports bar, and with two exciting football games and baseball playoffs on, they brought in a live band. The band was good, but come on! I couldn't even pay attention to my games with the volume. The service was a bit lacking as well. Long waits for drinks and just to be checked on. If you're going to be a sports bar, be a sports bar. No live music during game times, please. I would have left if I'd known they were doing that."}
{"text":"Short and sweet... Thank you Eric and Ryan. Mushroom burger and wild brat both fantastic. Great beer selection:) awesome addition to the neighborhood. Will be back with again soon."}
{"text":"To start, I was really hoping for a much more creative menu. My friend and I ordered the Bison sliders to start - very little meat, bun was stale, and the waitress sat down the plate with the sliders and walked away - no plates to eat them off, no napkins, no utensils. Not a good start. I really wanted rabbit, as I grew up eating a lot of rabbit and I really like it. They offer 2 rabbit dishes- rabbit sloppy joes and jackalope meatloaf. Since I did not want rabbit swimming in some sloppy joe sauce...I opted for the meatloaf.  Sad to say it was not seasoned well, and extremely dry. The vegetables were great-but I didn't go to a wild gsme restaurant for veggies!! I don't think we'll be going back. Perhaps my expectations were to high..."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here after finding it on yelp for the great reviews.. and well everyone was right the food is great the service was excellent ! I do wish it was a little closer but worth the drive"}
{"text":"Great new place to catch the game. Awesome staff who take care of you from the moment you walk in. Not your \"run of the mill\" menu either. There are unique and delicious menu options with great beers on tap too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I use Yelp to read other peoples' reviews, I really don't care to share my experiences, but if you like wings, WGG has the best wings in town.  Great prices on HH too.  Most importantly; best wings I have ever had.  Service was great as well.  I'm hoping they can steal some customers from Zipps, who treats their customers like tenants rather than guests - GET TO WILD GAME GRILL!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to watch the NBA Finals Game 6 and I found this place nearby! It is so amazing! I was a little hesitant but once we sat down at the bar it was instantly amazing! The Bartender was very attentive and friendly! We got the Sampler which was a phenomenal appetizers, that included Nachos, 2 sliders and a pork carnitas taco! It was so delicious I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood gem. We stayed down the street before a morning flight out and we were a little concerned about the neighborhood. Once we walked in this brand new construction with great beer, great food and a play area for kids. My wife and I love great food and eclectic places, since having kids it has been challenging, but when we find a place like this, it takes us back.  The wings were fantastic and the burgers were amazing!    They had a play area with crayons, butcher paper, a PS3 and all kinds of toys. They only have 1 high chair, so good luck.   Great place for foodies and foodies with kids."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! Just on the outskirts of Arcadia, but is as urban and modern as they come! This is my go-to spot for ice cold beer on tap, football, and to get my wings on with their Honey Hot bbq sauce! The best on the planet!   If you're looking for a cool sports bar, with a hot visual aid--that be Madison working the bar, and the owner (Ryan) making his rounds to make sure that his guests are satisfied, then you can't go wrong here!   Oh, and they have USB ports to charge your phone at the bar, and at some of the booths! AWESOME!  If you're up to trying different food, like Buffalo and wild boar, then you want to give it a go here! They have wild boar and buffalo!"}
{"text":"I had recently moved to Phoenix from southern California and was pleasantly surprised to find The Wild Game Grill. I noticed there is not much around Phoenix when it comes to a restaurant like this so here are my thoughts. The restaurant looks great and reminds me of many of the cutting-edge places I've been in Los Angeles and San Diego, there are great and simple details that many places fail to even recognize like multiple ways to charge my phone right at my table either using just a usb cable or my own charger .  On to the food and beer, on my first visit I had the B3 (Bison, Beef, Bacon)  and Fontina. Holy smokes was this thing awesome. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I paired the burger with the house draft called Wild Blonde which is a very drinkable craft beer made specifically for Wild Game Grill. On my second visit I had the wings since they were suggested to me by the server and again I am extremely pleased by how good they were. The wings are smoked and they are simply delicious and went well with my cider. This is a restaurant that has hit their mark with food, drink, and unbelievable flavors. Thank you Wild Game Grill."}
{"text":"This little bar and grill/ restaurant is really good. I've been here 4 times now and have had a good experience every time. The drinks are great and the chicken wings are AMAZING. They always have weekly flavors for wings and specials.  The owner is amazing very personable. The happy hour specials you can't beat. If you get a chance I recommend stopping by. They are still new and need some exposure until they get busy. The place ( plus the bathrooms!!!) had a very clean and have a sleek feel to them.  The employees are friendly and attentive! Definitely stop by and try it!!!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went there this evening to celebrate my son's birthday. We had our little newborn grandson in a carrier, hostess told us \"sorry we gave our high chair out already\" but made no effort to help us put the baby in a chair or anything...he was on the floor.  Next, our waitress took our drink orders, then our appetizers, didn't  hear one of the two appetizers we ordered,  even though she repeated it to me. Brought out the one appetizer...no plates to eat it on. I had to ask about the second app. She then brought it out with our dinner...kind of defeats the purpose of spending a longer time for dinner. Felt like we were rushed....  Hope to come back and have a better experience"}
{"text":"They are doing so much right with the food. You can tell they take their time to make sure everything is well prepared. I mean they smoke their wings and make all the sauces by hand! Not I mention all the great local beers they have on tap. Four Peaks pumpkin porter? Don't mind if I do..."}
{"text":"Thx guys. The beer was tasty and the street tacos were awesome.  My lady says the salmon tacos were the best but I preferred the bison. Thx again and see you soon."}
{"text":"Great concept and good service but the food was satisfactory at best. I NEVER, ever return food if I can stomach the taste but there was no option with the tuna tataki salad (like eating pure salt cubes). There were 5 different orders from the menu and everything else was decent, not great. But again, the service and staff were great and the menu was unique."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Plenty of TVS for sports, and wide variety of beer! Bison quesadilla was delicious!!! Place is new! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped into the wild game grill and have to say I love the place.  The food is fantastic and it was very comfortable with great staff. After being so frustrated from my flight been cancelled I'm glad I came across this place.  Just another addition to the greatest Super Bowl vacation! This place gets the Boston approval for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, I was going to dine in but life intruded. Got there early on purpose, food excellent not enough people there to judge ambiance. I had the boar quesodilla, excellent kitchen work. My server was bright, attentive and did an outstanding job."}
{"text":"I had the wild game steak (bison top sirloin) medium rare. It did not suck at all. I almost licked the plate. I sat at the bar. The service was excellent. I might come back tomorrow.  I wish places like this were more common in my travels. Phoenix - you should be proud!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a whim (I had never tried any wild game before) and we will definitely be back!!  He had the Bison burger with the roasted poblano pepper, and he finished the whole thing...and this is a behemoth of a burger.  He loved it.  He was very satisfied!  I tried the Jackalope Meatloaf (rabbit and antelope) and WOW.  I don't think I can have \"normal\" meatloaf ever again.  Did I mention it comes wrapped in bacon?  It also came with potato pancakes - which I hold to high standards anywhere - and I could've eaten 10 more.  Even the roasted begets led were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I have leftovers for another full meal!  Top notch.   To top it off, they have great happy hour specials; I paired my meal with an Apricot Wheat Ale, yummy!  Last but not least, our waitress Rachel was AWESOME! Very attentive, helpful, and just a great energy to round off a wonderful experience.  Will definitely be returning and asking for her!"}
{"text":"Great service by lorissa, she was a wonderful waitress. They were out of most good options and the food that we did have with mediocre and overcooked at best. The nachos were so sloppy and soaked in ranch dressing or something that made them pretty inedible. We get home leftovers for our birds."}
{"text":"Back again last Sunday and service was MUCH improved.  And our server didn't look like he was getting his ass kicked, which was nice to see.   Man, the wings are good!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  The atmosphere was casual.  The beers good."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good sports bar with plenty of TVs and good food. Wild Game fits the bill. Try the Hot, Honey, Hoppy wings! Great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, stayed at the Embassy Suites, Wild Game Sports Grill was just down the street.  The chipotle chicken taco are awesome, tasted just like the menu described, good chips and salsa with guacamole too.  Great beer selection, Scott was the bartender nice guy."}
{"text":"We are from out of town. After landing we were starving and looking for a good place to eat we found Wild Game grill. They were super friendly and informative about the menu. Ryan made some delicious drinks and was very attentive. Abdo came by to see how are meal was going. Absolutely a wonderful experience and incredible food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Not a bad thing to say. Definitely will be back. Got the B3 burger which melted like butter in your mouth. Not many places are brave enough to serve some of these unique offerings, and they do it well."}
{"text":"The food was flat, no flavor.!!!  Game meat should be full of bold flavors. This had none it. The manager was uncaring at best and we were charge for food that was returned."}
{"text":"This wont be a long review.  Ate here for the first time the other night (can't remember what time it was but it was night). I live close to the place (24th st and McDowell) and NEVER knew this place was there. We parked and walked in and the place was just about empty other then a guy i've known for 5 years randomly being there.  My buddy told me about the place over Google Hangouts and I checked out the menu online and got excited as I love wild game eating. We were seated and presented with the menu's and got our drink orders taken.  Even though I had looked at the dinner menu for a while on line, I couldn't decide what I wanted when I sat down. I did tell my friends that if the Wild Game Steak was an Elk steak, thats what I would get (I love elk meat and highly prefer it over beef) and of course, it was elk but there was only one left so I insisted my friend get it since he never had elk but he wouldn't comply with my gentlemenlyness and he got the Jackalope meatloaf (which was fantastic).  Long story short, the elk steak was cooked PERFECT....PERFECT!!!   I look forward to eating here again.  The End.  UPDATE: 5/19/15, My friend and myself are already regulars at this place and have eaten just about everything and have not found anything we don't like (I wont eat the Rocky Mountain Oysters, sorry). Ryan, Chelsea, and Rachel are rad as shit."}
{"text":"Excellent Wild Boar Carnitas,  highly recommend.   Friendly staff and fast service.    Have a beer to go with it !"}
{"text":"We went there after seeing the high ratings on Yelp. Sadly, Yelp, for once was misleading. The food wasn't bad. Just that it was regular average food. It is OK for a bite."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday, not too busy.  We were greeted right away and had the choice of patio or indoors. Our server was really friendly, we checked in on yelp and got the chips and salsa for free. Ordered the BLT and it was really good, they don't slack on the protein!  Also really liked their ice tea.  Seems like they have happy hour pretty much all the time so I'll be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area, fate brought me to a hotel that was just 900 feet from a dining revelation--The Wild Game Grill.  After perusing the menu on Yelp, I noted that it had a varied, inexpensive menu, and of course its namesake, Wild Game.  I was promptly greeted by a friendly, attractive, and enthusiastic staff and taken to my table.  I was fortunate that once again the stars aligned...it was Cinco de Mayo and Happy Hour to boot.  I tried a non descript margarita and moved on to the big show... A menu for game lovers and non lovers alike.    Being a little (not a lot--only a LITTLE) adventurous, I started with a chopped salad with grilled chicken and boar bacon, and enjoyed a wild boar and pork carnitas street taco.  The Cobb salad was perfectly prepared, albeit a little boaring (lame pun.). I blame myself for ordering a SALAD at a GAME restaurant.  The carnitas taco was succulent, moist, a little gamey with shredded cabbage, charred tomato salsa and chipotle cream--YUM!!!  Although I couldn't finish either dish I ordered, I had a moral imperative to order dessert...the Nutella Boar Bacon Sundae.  It had rich, vanilla bean and Ghiradelli chocolate, Nutella and boar bacon crumbles.  It was decadent with the smoky, salty punch of the boar bacon, although I would have liked the bacon a little crisper or in a bacon brittle (it's a texture thing...)  The exclamation point on this extraordinary meal is the bill.  A margarita, entree sized salad, two carnitas with a side of black beans and a fabulous sundae for dessert came to $32.45!!!  Everyone on the Phoenix area needs to try this place immediately.  The service is fantastic, the decor is simultaneously warm and modern and the food must be tried--again and again!"}
{"text":"Delish! Coming from a foodie. Unique food and amazing drinks. Atmosphere is not what I expected from a sports bar, it's so much more. Family oriented as well, brought the kiddos, they played while we enjoyed ourselves with friends!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon for some wings, beer and Cardinals football! The owner was extremely accommodating to every guest and made sure that everyone who came in could watch their favorite teams, although most TVs and the sound were on the Cardinals game. The space itself is beautifully remodeled. There are dozens of TVs all over the place and you could easily watch several games at once no matter where you sat. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very accommodating and I never had an empty glass. I had the classic wings and they were incredible. I've never had smoked wings before, but I am now a convert.  They have a variety of craft, local, and domestic beers on tap, and for great prices. It was a great new place to watch football and I am happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Always great! Now has a patio :-)  special today is kangaroo stuffed cabbage served with sautéed vegetables and cucumber mint yogurt!"}
{"text":"I've been to WG about 5-6x and food and staff is amazing! However I went there last night and the food wasn't great, it was different apparently they got a new cook. The hummus portion was tiny, the club was completely different and the mac and cheese was completely different. Next time I'll stick to wings! I'll still return but just a bummer about the dishes not being uniform in preparation :("}
{"text":"Great new place....foods great....great staff.... All around awesome!!!! This place is Frickin amazing...thanks Ryan!!!!"}
{"text":"Great unusual food, fantastic wings, cold beer and cute bartenders. Can you ask for anything more?  Friendly staff that know their product, nice atmosphere, and good eats. I had the wings like most do on their first visit and was not disappointed.   Worth a stop especially if you like game meats!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit and last. I don't like to bad mouth local businesses, but I have a big problem with this place. First off, if you look on their website they advertise that they show every Pac-12 and Big 10 football game. That's funny, because tonight when I went in they didn't have on Stanford vs Utah or Michigan State vs Maryland. What's even worse, they didn't even have on Notre Dame, who by the way was playing a Big 10 team or Auburn vs Georgia (two teams ranked in the top 15). That's Notre Dame football and the ESPN SEC Saturday night football game and I have to ask to put them both on? Think about that. I had to ask the manager to put on ESPN for me. At sports bar or grill whatever you want to call it....Are you kidding me? That's just bad.  More so there wasn't sound from the games - instead they play cheesy music like Bon Jovi (Bad Medicine nonetheless) and Tom Petty - songs you've heard a million times before. I came in to watch football - not listen to cheese! Speaking of sound - On my first visit - the owner felt the need to have the the Cowboys vs Giants game with sound on the big screen instead of the Cardinals game. Mind you, that's the first place Arizona Cardinals were are talking about! The local team - hello??? Not cool.   Food is totally hit or miss. The servers are friendly and there aren't enough televisions either. Lots of unused wall space and TV's could be bigger. Hard to see more than one TV at once. Yes, they have nice bathrooms and a children's corner, but that's about the best things regarding the interior. Get it together or you'll be going out-of-business. On this second visit, the place was dead on a Saturday night at dinner time."}
{"text":"This place was great! Food was great, service great fast and friendly! Helped us out with making decisions on so many entrees. We will definitely be back again!  Recommend the wings everyday!"}
{"text":"This place was fun until one of the owners took out the skee ball machine because our group kept winning the $.50 beers all night long. Thanks and won't be going to this bar again."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! Went last night for drinks & heavily enjoyed the bar. My husband had the wings and rabbit sloppy joe. Both fantastic! They also have ski ball which was a blast. Go immediately!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this new restaurant. Located in the up-and-coming Foote Addition Neighborhood of Central Phoenix, the food was way better than we expected.  We started with the Wild Boar Sliders and the Steak and Fontina Quesadillas.  Both were excellent. I ordered the Rabbit Sloppy Joe and my husband ordered the Bison Beef and Bacon Burger. I was surprised at how good both were. Portions were large and prices very reasonable. The front glass windows open for cooler nights and there are plenty of TVs to watch the various sports games playing. They also had a good happy hour menu. Parking is in the back. Overall, very impressed and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious! This place is a neighborhood hit.   We started with BBQ Bison Sliders (amazing!) and sweet potato fries to share and that was almost enough for two for the night. Still we were tempted by the Wild BLT, because bacon. Moscow Mules were a little overly citrus tasting for my liking but still good.   Our service was outstanding. The food came out freaky fast. The only issue was that we were sitting at the first hightop near the door and hostess booth facing the big screen on the opposite wall. The hostess with blue glasses kept pacing with an unpleasant face in front of the game. Luckily her shift ended before the game, so we got our clear view back.  My friends and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Let's see how long the food stays at 4.5 stars when they fired the kitchen manager who developed the menu and was severely being under paid asked for a raise and stole all his recipes.  Guess that didn't last long.  Karma."}
{"text":"Sunday 11am.   My husband and I walked into the \"sports grill\" for Football Sunday, noticed the empty bar and attempted to take a seat. The lovely bartender tells us \"the steeler game is over there\" and points to a corner in the room. There were two people seated at a 20 top bar and you're turning us away?? The three tv's over the bar were all tuned to the same game. OK.   We sat at in the corner we were directed after the hostess, who turned out to be our server, provided some off the mark excuse about why they can't change the tv's. Listen guys, I get the tv thing, but when your establishment is empty, you may want to consider bending the rules. Our server advised us that the lunch menu was beginning at 11 and their 9 item brunch menu until 12. As soon as I decide on my food choice, she rushes over to say we can't order lunch... At 11... I felt forced to order the breakfast burrito since 2 of the options included hot/cold cereal... Really? I have that at home. No lie. I really do.   So after what seems to be a lifetime... I had to use the restroom. When I came back, apparently the manager had stopped by apologizing for the lunch menu not being available to us... Well me. He bought our meal before it arrived. Our food arrived and it looked gross. Tortilla barely cooked, eggs were rubbery and salsa was bland. Even though I was starving, I still only ate half. Now, the best part... While I finished my half of burrito, at 1145, the obnoxiously drunk table we were forced to sit next too got their food. Guess what they got?!? LUNCH!! Not just lunch, blt's. The specific menu item I wanted, yet denied. Also, I wasn't offered another cocktail until I was finished eating.   I don't get the five star reviews. The food was not good. If it was taken care of already, I would have sent it back. Service was slow and the bartender was rude.    Maybe in six months I'll consider returning.... IF they are are open."}
{"text":"Good food, can be adventurous with some of the game meats or keep it more traditional with burgers. Simple kids menu (to be expected), BONUS kids area with toys !  Friendly staff, not too busy for a Sat night party of 6, (4 tall, 2 small).  The adults got to talk and the kids (5 & 6), played within view.  The street tacos with wild boar were gooood. Bison burgers were NOT dry, which can happen easily with such a lean meat. Wings were good as well.  Buttered noodles for a small fry was a very small portion.  Slider for the other tot meal was good sized.  Looking forward to another trip to this centrally located spot. I may goes rabbit hunting next??"}
{"text":"I dig a place where I can watch the game, not worry about bringing the kids, and enjoy a menu that is far removed from the regular fare that clog up the tables of most sports bars.  Only wish the location and parking lot were a little bigger."}
{"text":"I don't post much on Yelp, but definitely had to drop a line about this place to help get the word out. Great atmosphere, great service, great food, and a fun place to day drink and meet new people.    We started with the cheese curds and wings as appetizers. The cheese curds were delicious and the wings were definitely better quality (thicker and juicier) than most wing places.  My boyfriend asked for a bbq chicken sandwich, which wasn't on the menu, but Rachel was happy to accommodate his request.  For desert we had the blackberry cobbler which was amazing!   I personally liked that Wild Game pays close attention to small details by making their own sauces, having outlets at every table/bar stool,  and bringing in their own Wild Blonde beer phx brewing company brews just for Wild Game.  Rachel, Will and Ryan (who personally chooses the songs that play in the restaurant - nice touch!) were all very knowledgeable about the menus, friendly, and made us feel welcome.   We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The soft opening was a great experience. Staff is really nice, place is super clean and modern and the food is fantastic. Looking forward to the live music and patio. I definitely recommend spending some time here whether you're hungry or just looking for somewhere to have a beer and some great food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a great new place upscale then other bars around , and a great selections of beers. Many tvs and a big screen projector for the games!."}
{"text":"After finishing a very long shift at work, I was famished and wrestling with one of my rare cravings for red meat. My boyfriend, with the aid of the mighty internet, discovered this place nearby.  Whatever the seasonal game steak is, GET IT! I ordered the bison steak cooked to medium rare; it came out closer to medium but was so tender and perfectly seasoned that it didn't matter one bit.  My boyfriend got the 3 brats. Typically, I despise them but these were made of 3 types of game meat and  delicious!  We finished with the cronuts (basically croissant donuts) which were recommended by our waitress. They were pleasantly light, sweet, and perfect after finishing my entire plate.  Prepare yourself for an audio/visual sports onslaught. Big screen TVs everywhere and quite noisy. I was glad it wasn't a busy night because that's not really my speed but, the food was too good for me to leave anything less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! So after a rough Thursday, I was looking forward to watching my Giants clinch the NCLS, glancing at the Jets vs Pats game and catching the tail-end of a happy hour with the hubby.  Wild Game delivered on all 3...   So here's the thing...they smoke their wings (and if you ask nicely, they will put them on the grill to make them extra crispy for ya!)...these may have been THE BEST chicken wings I've ever had. We went with the \"Hot, Honey and Hoppy\" wings (they are sauced with an IPA syrup, honey and tabasco blend that is PHENOMENAL.) We also split the pastrami burger w/ fries.   Not only was the customer service stellar, but the food was delicious! The smokiness of the wings is perfect and balanced very well with the sauce.  The guy next to us, a self-professed connoisseur of all things super spicy, ordered their hot wings with a side of extra-hot sauce...one bite and his face turned orange. After gulping some Coconut Joe's beer, he was able to articulate that he was impressed.  (And my Giants won (of course!), but I'm certain that this tidbit of info has not skewed my review).   I'm so happy they moved into the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My uncle and I came in for Sunday night football, had some beers and burgers. Our waitress was Shelbi. She was super nice and accommodating. We enjoyed the service, the beer, the food and the place in general. I asked for an IPA from the bar and when the beer came that wasn't what I thought it'd be, they replaced it no problem. Nice to find this place and neighborhood folk should check it out! I bet Saturday  college football would be amazing here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in Phoenix. Ryan, the GM is awesome and always remembers your name. The food is great especially the elk steak and the jackalope meatloaf (yes it's a real thing). They have also started having brunch on Friday Saturday and Sunday from10-2. I totally recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Our son has been at Phoenix Children's Hospital for a few weeks and my wife and I have a new escape!  The smoked wings are amazing, the juiciest we've had. Get the Teriyaki if they're featuring them.  I've the meAtloaf  and ribs and they've been great.    Ryan has been an absolutely incredible server. When is the last time you went to a bar and were greeted by name?    Great selection of beers on tap, super clean atmosphere and great unusual food. We love it!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  The hot wings are very delicious.  The \"Wild Blond\" beer is soooooo good.  My wife had a steak cooked medium well..... melted in the mouth.  Carnitas tacos with black beans are so worth the trip!  Flat screens TV's all over the place and the decor is spot on with a modern flare.  Plenty of parking in back of restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Completely fresh and some of the friendliest staff around! I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the elk stake and wild boar tacos.  Bartender very personable. Waitress attentive"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and the service is great! We had a fantastic meal. Casual atmosphere and great menu selection of game!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that they say that they close at 11 PM of which I think that they do however it must be noted that the kitchen closes at 10 PM. With that being said we got there at about 9:55 PM last night because I was at a speaking event and wanted some dinner. So we walked in and were told that the kitchen closes in a minute if you want to that they weren't sure if they were able to serve us so I initially got irritated but then the manager said out not a problem will be more than happy to serve you. Then we sat down and we ordered for it quickly out of respect for the kitchen because we didn't want to keep them there any longer than they had to be. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my girlfriend ordered for tacos. My chicken sandwich was very good it came out nice and juicy I know what you see is a funny word but it did. The boar was a little too gamy for my girlfriend but that has no reflection on this restaurant or the food itself it's just the animal being a bore. What was really nice however unnecessary was that when I happen to tell my waiter he went to the manager and only charge half price for that. Again completely unnecessary but also very nice.  The lighting in there was good all of the TVs were nice it was an all-around chill place to go and I'm glad that we went there. It would've been nice if you would've been able to order dessert however again the kitchen was closed so will just have to go there a little earlier next time. I'm giving this five-star review because it meets all of my criteria.    One more massively huge point I must say about this place is that the tables come equipped with three prong outlets and USB outlets so that you never have to worry about your phone dying that is by far the best part about walking in that place that I found out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an exotic lunch but they don't serve anything interesting on the lunch menu. The dinner minutes didn't really look very WILD as the name implies. The food was good but expensive. I was expecting a more exotic menu so I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last month so I decided it was time to write my review! Wild Game is an awesome spot to catch happy hour, a sporting event on tv, or even a nice meal. Each time I've gone I've ordered the wings, which to my surprise were actually smoked before being tossed in the sauce of your choice. The sauce options are all very interesting, yet extremely tasty! If interesting isn't your thing, stick with the classic, even those are incredible. The rest of the menu looks very appealing, but I love ordering wings and beer when I'm watching football, so I haven't strayed much.  I docked one star for sporadic and somewhat unattentive service. I understand that Wild Game is still new on the bar scene, and hopefully these kinks will be smoothed out in the near future. Either way, I foresee many return visits in my very near future!"}
{"text":"Delicious 3B burger! I was not a fan of the salsa and chips, they were missing flavor, no salt, no chile, no seasoning. The chili cheese fries we had substituted for regular fries, were definitely different, you could tell it was quality meat! My love and I split the burger and a beer and it ended up being $29, not including tip, but I do recommend going to try something new! One day I will try something more rare. ;)"}
{"text":"I must say, this was the first time the reviews have let me down.  Decided to try this place out because the reviews sounded good and we're lovers of wild game.  Went on a Sunday night, and the place was not crowded at all, so it was weird when the host said to us, 'It will be a minute.' - huh?  There's hardly anyone here!  Anyway, once we were sat, we decided to try several apps - the boar sliders (not bad but not great), wild game chili (lacking seasoning, so no taste), and nachos with carnitas (huge plate, pretty good), and entrees - wild boar carnitas tacos (very greasy), jackalope meatloaf (meatloaf was good, but sides had no seasoning/flavor) and big 3 brats (good).  The only positive was that the portions are large.  As I mentioned before, there was hardly anyone in the place, and yet our food took forever to come out, well over an hour.  When it did come, they brought us everything together (apps and entrees), and they got one of our orders totally wrong and forgot the chili.  It took another 15 minutes to get the correct order and the chili.  No apologies for the food taking so long or for the incorrect order.  That on top of the food being average at best, we would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"MY RATING HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD. THE FOOD WOULD GET 5 STARS EASILY!  Starting off positive, the food was excellent! I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were, BY FAR, the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot, Honey, and Hoppy wings, and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those, and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic, fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only, I will be visiting again.  Now for the reason I gave a 2-star rating. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game, so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However, the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.  We started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter, Scott, took our order. We put in for the wings, burgers, and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips, but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around, he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out, which was fine wit me, but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it.   About 10 minutes into dinner, one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again, our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later, another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask, Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time, we just had our mind on getting the check.   It took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check, so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall, we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion, there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table."}
{"text":"This place is becoming our go to place to watch sports...and eat & drink well! Watched the USA vs Netherlands game here yesterday with a buddy of mine and just like every other visit, it was great. Had the place almost to ourselves at 11am, so Dahlia and the rest of the staff took care of us.  The big screen was dropped down for us ( owner is super cool) and our request to listen to the game was also granted.  Have been here when it is packed and when it is just a few patrons and the service is always excellent.    Gobbled down some awesome wings ( Garlic & Classic), a fantastic Carnitas burger, and quaffed down a couple of tasty beers.  So many mouth watering things to choose from on this menu.  We always get the wings and the rest of the menu we take down one trip at a time."}
{"text":"Service was subpar...my chicken pesto sandwich had MOLD on the bun...the boar & pork tacos were cold and the coleslaw didn't taste fresh...my other friend had the chopped salad which she was was just \"okay\"... I don't believe we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went here Thursday night at 8:30 and the place was fairly busy. The location is good. It has plenty of TV's to call it self a  a true good sports grill. When I had initially arrived I wasn't greeted in the normal matter I would get at restaurant.  This may be due to multiple entry points or lack of front house support.. When I finally did get a servers attention I asked where I could sit and she said anywhere is fine.  I eventually found myself in the main dinning area where they have an enormous screen for the main game that was on.  The seats are comfortable and table was clean and sturdy.  I had sat there for almost five minutes before the server arrived at my table to drop off a menu and took my drink order.  I ordered a Kilt Lifter. After the server put the drink in, she never came back to the table until the drink was ready, which was almost another 5 minutes. I was never asked if I had come here before or if I had any questions or if I wanted to start with an appetizer.  I had asked the server opinion if I should order the Pastrami Burger or the Pan Roasted chicken.  She was kind dumbfounded and didn't really know how to answer questions, but said that she had seem a lot of people order the Pastrami burger. So I had Order the Calamari for an appetizer, Pastrami burger with the Garlic Bacon Fontina Mac. The food was was outstanding.  It came out of the kitchen full of flavor.  The Calamari was crispy and the dipping sauce was good. The Pastrami burger was amazing.  You could taste every element of the burger. From the juicy Pastrami to the  tangy slaw and the dressing on the burger.  I thought the burger was going to messy, but surprisingly it was well maintained and never fell apart due to the good quality bread and the right amount of dressing and construction of the burger. It was also cooked to perfection. The Garlic Bacon Fontina Mac was good but not great.    During my experience the manager came by and asked how the food was and made sure he stop by and touched every table within my eye view.  Also while I was there a game had become a blow out and they changed the channel to a more competitive and entertaining game, which was much appreciated by the guest.  I also noticed a kids section/corner,  where they had a small tv with kids movies, games, and other things.  Something you wouldn't find at a normal restaurant, but I am sure that is appreciated by other guest. . After paying my bill and leaving a tip the server thanked me and then follow up by introducing herself at the end, which I found odd, since that is something I would expect her to do when she first comes over to the table to drop off the menu's..  All and all, the food is amazing, the atmosphere is good, but the service is something that needs to be improved. I will definitely come back to give it another go, I just hope that the servers step there game up or else this could be a problem for them."}
{"text":"Will? The bartender?! Yea.... He was amazing! Put a spin on some great cocktails for us! Went in with my husband after driving by this place enough times. The bison, elk and venison sausage platter was pure amazement and paired with the signature cocktail made by Will?! Yea... Done! We will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"I discovered Wild Game Grill by driving down Thomas Road. I did a double take. What is this place? Who built this modern looking restaurant with wide open doors on this lovely sunny Phoenix day? How long has it been here beautifying the area that is in need of new things? Fast forward an hour and I had my answer. 3 months they've been serving really good food in a relaxed sports related environment. Much better food than your normal sports bar. I saw bison burgers on the menu. Desserts that look incredible. My waitress read my mind and mentioned their soup special. I am a soup guy! Cheese and broccoli? Yes please! Potato cakes are also cheesy with a hint of pablano pepper. Tried the homemade coleslaw and it's about the best I ever had! I tend to judge a restaurant on its gravy or it's coleslaw. I judge Wild Game Grill 5 stars! Prices seem good too. There's a lot of food I have not tried yet so I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Middle of the day so it was quite and my server was kinda new but...  Chili with elk, venison, etc.  Freaking amazing Wild Boar slider - nice with a homemade slaw and tangy BBQ sauce  Wish there was one near me!"}
{"text":"2 words: Cheese Curds  A great experience and I love the pastrami. Everyone has some type of wild game experience. Nothing like this really exist in Phoenix. Drinks were not overpriced. I look forward to going again and trying something new.  I heard they've been open for about 2 weeks and if this place continue doing what it's doing I know it will be a staple of Central Phoenix. Nice people good service great food. Also it might be a bit empty because it's really new. But if you want really unique food and not a totally huge price this is a place to go."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is better, and the restaurant's beautiful. New favorite place, my friends included."}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink and have some food. Tried the smothered fries which is vension and elk chili over fries. For dinner I had the wild game BLT which is boar bacon, duck bacon with avocado, lettuce, tomato. Definitely our new favorite place and its only around the corner"}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, sports and outlets for us technology slaves? I think, yes!  After some unfortunate and poor service at the previous bar I was at with Stacy M., Wild Game Grill came to the rescue. I got a Redbull Vodka, tried the Rootbeer Shot and a small dessert to share. I was torn between dessert, but I went with the Wild Berry Crumble which was warm, slight spice with a yummy breading all a la mode. The crumble wasn't a typical butter and flour, but more bready which I'm all for- it was heart warming!  Ryan the bartender/owner was a delight to talk to and did a great job talking to everyone at the bar and told me about his business. There's a good amount of TVs to watch any sports or games and there are outlets every where around the place. I believe there is free wifi as well.  Can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu! I heard there's ski ball too. /squeals."}
{"text":"Great grub and good service. This place is has a great atmosphere and everyone is really friendly. Definitely go with the calamari and wings and my wild boar chopped salad hit the spot. Great place to watch the game with all the big screens"}
{"text":"Those Wild Boar sliders were sliding down quite well.  A+ service and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine introduced me to the Wild Game Grill today, and I can't wait to come back and try more items of their incredible menu.  The B3 burger was fantastic, and the Bison & Fontina Quesadillas were excellent as well.  The staff are friendly, there are plenty of drink options, and the food is great.  You simply can't ask for more.  I'm looking forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in two weeks and tried something different each time.  Everything....let me repeat, everything I have tried has been amazing.  The wings are probably the best I have ever eaten.  The bison tacos were just spicy enough for my taste, the BLT was loaded with flavor and did I mention the wings?  My partner who is Asian laughs at American spicy food...he wasn't laughing when he tried the wings.  He loved them and if you can believe it, the kim chi on the Korean flavored taco was actually too hot for him.  That's a compliment, though...he loved it!  There is a great selection of beers and the prices are reasonable.  The location is not ideal for my travels, but worth it to get great food."}
{"text":"Ready, set, go...it's another new bar and grill in the cenpho area.  It's a new concept, too. Somewhat 'rustic, outdoors loving dudes bringing beer and sports to you?'  First impression was meh.  I was not overwhelmed by the decor and the low end cabinets / bar atmosphere.  In fact, it seemed a little plain and somewhat off putting in comparison to the fancier / hip bars in the area.  It was late, and we didn't have a lot of time left before closing, so we determine to push through the bland decor.    Then we met Ryan. The second impression on this place far exceeded my expectations - it actually blew me away.  Ryan (I think that was his name) was super helpful, nice and very attentive. He learned our names, used them often, and made recommendations for late night snacks and drinks.  He was very thoughtful and super attentive to the bar and the restaurant. He made it his business to know EVERYONE by first name - yes - EVERY single person who sat at the bar...even us newbies.  For that reason I now know the first name of the very drunk fellow who sat by me at the bar.  He tried to pay his tab with fake money ('Bourbon Bucks'), which the bartender politely gave back. Then he didn't sort his own money and shoved it across the bar towards Ryan somewhat indiscriminately.  Ryan slowly straightened each bill and only took the amount necessary (rounded down to the nearest paper dollar) for his tab.  It was so kind I wanted to hug the bartender for being such a sweet soul.  What happened next really made my day...the bartender called my friend a cab.  He refused to let him drive home and he even confirmed that the fellow had been safely stowed away in the cab with fare and addresses exchanged.    Now for the food.  It was darn good for late night bar food.  Smoked wings, with a dry rub! My favorite.  General helpings too! Chips and Artichoke Dip.  Yummy and homemade as well. Everything tasted fresh. It was really a nice experience to eat there and I hope we can come back for the food during the day! :-)  We will definitely be back..  So this was originally a 4 Star, but the bartenders service was so remarkable and unique, I am going with a 5 star."}
{"text":"Wow went here today from father's day we had the wild boar hash with  tortillas and the carnitas scramble with rocky Mountain oysters as a appatizer great service lots of TV'S . The boar was so tender with a little spice the carnitas were very well seasoned gonna be back very soon wanna try the venison brats"}
{"text":"Checked this place out at the recommendation of a friend and I wasn't disappointed. The menu has some fun big game items like wild boar and pork carnitas street tacos, rabbit sloppy joe, and so much more.  For those of you with a sweet tooth try the cronut desert.  They offer a weekend brunch from 9-12 and a reverse happy hour that starts at ten.  If you want a flavorful spicy addition to your meal try the habanero hot sauce.  This is also a great place to catch a ball game or to hang out with friends while enjoying drinks and the fun of wild game without having the work of the hunt."}
{"text":"I ate here on a business trip and the food was delicious. I ended up sitting at the bar for dinner and Ryan the bartender/part owner was very friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sports bar!! This is my third time here.  Tvs r great,  service has always been good. Food is a little different meaning it's not like all other placed. The chili was as good as I ever had, salsas has its on flavor and my crew said the burgers were awesome! ! Starting to b a regular spot to hang,  drink,  eat and watch sports."}
{"text":"I've been to wild game twice now and both times it was delicious! My boyfriend has gotten the last meal burger both times because he loves bison and chili cheese covered anything. He loved it both times and I also enjoyed my chile relleno burger quite a bit! The service is good and they gave us 10% off our check BOTH times! They have a great selection of wild game, burgers and apps. The beer list looked pretty decent too! We will be back as for sure!"}
{"text":"Soft opening is amazing! Food is outstanding, great beer choices, and you will definitely find us here daily for happy hour! Great job on the new place!"}
{"text":"Started off with the Roasted Chili Glaze smoked wings and they were phenominal. Perfectly cooked meaty wings. Sauce was awesome, you can taste  the quality of these ingredients right away. Next the Bison Burger \"B3\" was great bacon was awesome. Smotherd fries were killer. Loved my first visit service was excellent and quick... I cant wait to come back to try the bison rojo and steak."}
{"text":"Overall, good service from our waitress.We ordered 5 happy hour items (and some regular stuff)- when we got our bill only 1 item was priced at the happy hour price. We noticed one right away but didn't notice the others until we got home.  The wings were on special ($8 for 10 wings) so we got half and half totaling 2 orders. She said she couldn't do the happy hour price since we got \"half\" orders of wings after she gave us the bill.  Overall, we were overcharged $8 total on our bill. Not a big deal but really frustrating. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"What a great find in an unexpected place!  I went here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised with my experience.  The parking situation is a little sketchy.  It was lunchtime and not that crowded, so it was fine, but I didn't see a ton of parking, so that might be an issue if it starts getting crowded.  The entrance is also a bit confusing, as there's no \"enter\" or \"entrance\" sign on the door -- I wasn't sure if we were going in the right door.  Outside of those two things, everything was great!  Nice and clean on the inside, with windows that open up to the patio and TVs all around.  The menu is very different and creative.  I had the Bison BBQ Sliders and a side of the Bacon and Garlic Mac and Cheese.  The sliders were absolutely delish -- 3 per order, served on pretzel buns and topped with coleslaw.  The mac and cheese was also really good -- hot and creamy with a nice crunch from the bacon pieces on top.  My friend ordered the Bratwurst and of course I had to have a bite -- so amazing!  Neither the bratwurst nor the sauerkraut was overpowering and they balanced each other nicely.  Just really good and different food!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am SO disappointed!!! I really wanted to love this place. I sure should have taken pictures of the food. It would have helped explain. My husband and I both love game, but at lunch, they didn't have much to offer and the game steak was bison, which is farm raised...not game! I am still shocked that we paid $12 for 12 tiny pieces of Rocky Mountain oysters! We are used to slices. I honestly think this was less than one whole oyster. The breading and bacon grease flavor overpowered any RMO flavor, although they were tender. Our server talked us in to the chili cheese fries with added carnitas. It sounded great. It tasted awful. The carnitas were completely flavorless and were overcooked to the consistency of dog food. The fries were SO soggy. Yuck. Also $12. So...the $7 beer was cold and the server was great, hence the two stars. The building is also really nice. I sure wish them all the best, but doubt we will ever be back."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday NFL football breakfast. Great food and good service to boot. The Cronut French Toast is to die for and their mimosas are champagne-heavy yum. We snacked our way through the lunch menu and enjoyed the nachos, burgers, wings, and tacos - all made with a variety of yummy game meats. This kid-friendly bar has ski-ball and stand-up video games too so bring the fam. Love it and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Picture it: Allen's 4&th birthday and an intimate gathering of friends join him for a celebratory dinner. Always on the lookout for a new dining adventure, he choses Wild Game Grill. Enter Bacon: seven minutes late.  \"Oh, I see you ordered the fried cheese curds,\" as I grab a handful before doing the hugs-round.  \"By checking in on Yelp, we get a free order of chips and salsa,\" to the applause of my fellow diners. There may have been a You're-the-coolest-ever dropped after that announcement. Or not. So we order those and the loaded fries. The latter was colossally good. The former, not bad.  Enter Entrees:  It should come as no surprise I ordered the dish with the most bacon--Wild BLT: wild boar bacon, duck bacon, apple wood cured bacon. On 9 grain bread, because it's healthy. Right? And it was truly one of the most tasty BLTs I've had. Other items ordered were the Three Brats (I sampled a bite of each, and all were terrific!), the filet mignon wrapped in duck bacon (I dragged a French fry through the gravy on this one--wicked good), bison, and a chicken pasta dish. [Hey, we can't all be adventurous with our taste buds]. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their dishes.  I grew up a hick, and I'm proud of that. We were able to eat from the earth and whatever my dad could shoot. At WGG, the gamey-ness, although not very pronounced, reminded me of some great meals we had back in the day. [queue \"Little House on the Prairie\" music]  So Bacon, you may ask, it seems the food here was pretty terrific. Oh ya, I'd reply. But did I tell you about the SERVICE!?!?! [queue dramatic music]  Well, that's the thing. Our idle time between ordering items, receiving them and having engaging interactions with the wait staff was lengthy, to say the least. I'm okay with waiting for food, especially if I'm kept abreast on its preparation/arrival. Or clearing out our dirty dishes. But when we have to wave down our server it can be a bit annoying.  All things considered, this is definitely a place to which I'll be returning. I just hope they work out the service issues. Cuz, you never know when Ma and Pa O'Neill will be comin' to town."}
