{"text":"Customer service is important so my advice to the girl that served me is to remove your headphones while at work. Sad."}
{"text":"Today I went to this location again and was impressed the staff recognized me at once and offered Mighty Kale with fresh bananas... again awesome taste and excellent customer service.. this location have some kind of built in energy. One feels good and energized after having the sandwich and drink from this Jugo store.   I am now a fan of this business.. I asked this guy if I order twisted roots, will he be able to put protein in my juice ? He nodded and explained me the two step process of fresh squeezing and then blending the juice with protein... this guy deserves a bump in his wages... !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a wrap and watermelon to take on the plane ride home. The wrap was stale round the edges and some pieces of melon were soft and over ripe.  Update....a few hours later. I messaged them on facebook and they've offered me a voucher for a free smoothie. Customer service is good at head office, but they need a shake up at the Calgary Airport location.  I received vouchers for free smoothies and used them. A big high five to the head office and facebook page."}
{"text":"This was my first time of visiting this particular Jugo Juice. I ordered my standard mighty kale smoothie and then watched with growing trepidation as it was prepared in an unwashed blender cup. (The cup had obvious remnants of whatever green smoothie had been prepared before mine).   When the drink was ready and presented to me, I questioned why they hadn't used a clean blender cup as I was accustomed to in other Jugo Juice locations. Their response was \"that's the cup we always use for mighty kale.\" Without knowing how long the remnant smoothie had been in the cup before they topped it with mine, I rejected the drink and asked for a fresh one to be made.   I'm appalled that they would blatantly risk customers getting food poisoning. I was pregnant at the time and food poisoning could have had devastating consequences for me. Suffice to say that I won't bother coming back to this outlet."}
{"text":"The only thing I like at Jugo Juice is the Pomegranate Protein smoothie... there is something about the texture of this smoothie that simultaneously repulses and excites me.  It's like sucking back sweet, styrofoamy air.  Unfortunately this particular airport Jugo Juice location doesn't keep frozen blackberries on hand, so the Pomegranate Protein doesn't appear on its menu.  When I asked, the girl offered to make me one with blueberries instead of blackberries.  I gave it a try and found it perfectly acceptable.  Unfortunately the three people in front of me in line did not find their food acceptable- all THREE had to return their food or beverage and have it re-made.  Wrong smoothie, wrong sandwich, cold sandwich, etc... Yikes.  The success rate of this place seems to be one out of four.  Maybe 2013 will be the year 50% of their customers fly away satisfied!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered food from this kiosk. I really wanted a warm, crisp wrap. The sauce is sweet and a little off tasting on the smoked turkey. $7.10 is very expensive for the small, low quality item you receive. The service was quiet but pleasant. I have received fresh and flavourful food from other locations so this was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This location is located in the lobby of the Husky building in Calgary. Their service is pretty quick, although I find their wrap sandwiches to have less filling than other locations. Being as their prices for sandwiches are already a bit gougy, I was less than impressed with this. I also found this location to not be as friendly as some others downtown. The cashier/manager has a bit of an abrupt tone and he seems impatient with customers if they don't approach the cash already speaking their order. Sometimes a hello or a moment to decide would be nice.  This location probably does okay because of where it is but if they don't fine tune their service, they may have some issues."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Great food. Not too expensive for something healthy and quick."}
{"text":"Came here twice during our stay in Calgary. The couple that owns this place is extremely sweet and helpful. We ordered smoothie bowls each visit - one was blueberry and the other was a mango based. I preferred the latter since it had more flavor to it. Could see this place getting crowded since its across from the school."}
{"text":"This Jugo Juice is at the PERFECT location.  Right on 17th Ave, right where you'd need it after an exhausting day of shopping.  Nothing quite like kicking your heels up on a bright orange arm chair and enjoying a thirst-quenching Jugo Juice.  Fantastic location, great ambiance, and as always, DELICIOUS drinks and wraps.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"12/30  A Jugo Juice smoothie before a long flight, is probably the worst idea in the world. But YYC Airport, in all their brilliance, put not one, but several Jugo Juice stands in their Gates. And I always wind up visiting one, because I'm incredibly disorganized before a long flight, always. And I'll show up, starving, thirsty; eyeing the limp, wilted looking wraps in the display case as though they're manna from the heavens. And I'll take one bite and go from starving panda, to sad panda. To broke panda, because, as pricey as Jugo Juice is outside of the Airport confines; it's about 25% moreso inside.   Want a cup of chunky vinegar that's as big as your torso? Head on down to Jugo Juice. It defies logic. You watch them toss all the ingredients together in a blender, and they seem to be adding a buttload of sugary fruit (that 59g per serving doesn't appear out of nowhere! A cup of regular OJ is 30g, for comparison). Then you take that first sip, and your face caves in. Then you force yourself to finish as much as possible, because you probably handed them your first born in order to pay for it.   Two stars, because I'll probably be back again soon. Because as much as I gripe about Jugo Juice, it's like a terrible boyfriend whose number I can't seem to erase from my phone. And I still can't manage to get to the airport with a coffee and a sandwich."}
{"text":"I honestly can't tell if this place is overpriced or not, and their employees really could give less of a ... but having a place like this in the airport is SUCH a blessing!  In a land full of airport fast food, or heavy slow food, Jugo Juice is the perfect answer to having a light and healthy snack to keep you sane in between flights. I loved my Kale Mighty juice and it was soooo yummy that I drank it all in less than 10 min which I usually can't do!  Their prices seem reasonable for the fact that its fresh vegetables and fresh juice, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I generally make my own smoothies, but sometimes you need a re-fuel. I've been a long time jugo lover, they have great options, they're quick and it's tastes good.   My one complaint would be, they charge you for boosters, where other places (booster juice) don't. I don't usually get them, but sometimes it's nice to have the option. I do like you can get the little snack size, if you just want something to hold you over.   And not that I can eat it, but they serve wheat grass, which if you're not a celiac is a power food."}
{"text":"Me, my wife and our two small children became violently ill 3-4 hours after having smoothies in your 17 Ave SW location at about 2:30pm on Sunday July 2. Thanks for ruining the long weekend. I will be alerting Alberta Health."}
{"text":"Love the fact that there are healthy juice options at the airport. But both juices I Got they used a majority of apple, even though one was a beet juice. I would have liked it to have more of the vitamin rich ingredients, not just apple to fill the cup up. Also, attendant was not very friendly :("}
{"text":"It was clean, fast, and hit the spot when I did not have time to eat. Not much else to look for in a smoothie place."}
{"text":"had my usual veg max here.  gasp they changed owners.  now it seems to be run by the same people who hate good service and fresh produc3.   I have a head ache and feel food poisoned.  I was fine before it and its the only thibg thing ive had today.   avoid this chinook mal location at all costs"}
{"text":"I normally would rate jugo juice higher but this particular location in YYC is disappointing. Employees barely speak English with a limited vocabulary. They have an indifferent attitude and the wraps do not look fresh or inviting. When you ask for a scoop of an additive, I have caught them twice now putting less even though you pay for it. If you end up with extra juice, instead if offering to you like other locations do, they just throw it away. Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"The wrap was edible . . . . but tasteless . . . .  Stick with one of their smoothies or protein shakes.  I felt like I needed something more substantial and nutritious, so I ordered the \"smoked turkey wrap\".  Oh man, the wrap was cardboard-y, the meat straight out of the plastic bag, not \"fire-grilled\", the cheese sparse, the honey mustard thin, but the spinach was OK.  I think I was smoked, not the wrap . . . at the cash register."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Jugo...always a 5star service and quality, the fresh juices are amazing everytime and smoothies are yummy! Parking on 17th can be difficult sometimes, but jugo makes it all better. If you're sitting in, it can get noisy in there as the smoothie machine is very noisy."}
{"text":"Pretty solid juice here. Tried the dragonfruit, berry, ginger smoothie. Ton of ginger- almost overpowering but still good. They don't have a huge selection of food - juice/smoothies are the focus. Not bad overall."}
{"text":"Considering airport service, this one's pretty speedy.  Ordered the Abundant Acai, with 2 ppl ahead of me, and by the time I decided between 2 protein bars, my smoothie was ready.  Located Domestic side by Gate C54.  A ton of other wraps on display but seriously, when they're stacked like that, it's not appealing to me ;("}
{"text":"When you deliver healthy smoothies, that's a bonus star ;)  as what anyone would expect from a franchise; consistency and cleanliness.  good service, friendly owner."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Jugo Juice so it is possible this is not typical.   The airport service was fine - not outstanding but capable.  I ordered the PB & chocolate and was shocked at how watered down it was. I was unable to finish it."}
{"text":"I had place a delivery order (for a friend) today at Jugo Juice today. The guy who assisted me with my order... possibly could be their delivery person... was wonderful. Helpful. Friendly. Delivery was quicker than expected. Everything was amazingly done well! Feedback of the food and drink was very yummy. Overall, very impressed with this Jugo Juice location."}
{"text":"It's OK.  Super sized sugary smoothies and adequate sandwich served with indifferent service.  Captive audience in the A gates at YYC which has little else."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Cesar snack and I loved it. It tasted very good or maybe I was hungry. It is fast food at the airport. I don't expect much and it is in the C gate section. There is not a lot of meat in the wrap but its so moist and lots of sauce and a good amount of cheese.   Snack size $4.95."}
{"text":"I got the Mighty Kale and it pretty much tasted like how I thought it should taste. Very smooth, not too sweet, and by the looks of it, green and healthy. Not bad! Price was $7.30 which is quite high for a juice, but I guess that's airport prices for ya!"}
{"text":"I've always loved the might of Mighty Kale. And this place didn't take away that thankfully.   Regardless of price, I think its a healthier alternative to fast food. Which brings me to their wraps. Both veggie and butter chicken wrap, contrary to earlier reviews tasted fresh and good. Far more preferable to in-flight food which is truly tasteless. And older than it looks.  Don't care for service as long as food is good. Too busy to even notice. It's the airport. In transit. Grab, slurp, eat and go board your cramped up flight. Unless 'You are bumped'!"}
{"text":"You get one star for being unbearably irritated that I happened to order something that required carrots... Quite obviously, you were fresh out. \"I'm sorry, apparently my telepathic abilities are not refined enough to discern that message emanating from your cryptic, soured, post-vomit scowl\"... strike one for me.  So you gracious offer to replace the carrots with extra apples. Ha ha! Fooled me once, shame on me. Fooled me twice shame on... well, shame on... somebody... look, somebody should be ashamed! (read: George W Bush)... Anyways, the damn thing already has apples, in fact, it's like 90% apples... so why not just offer me apple juice with a wedge of pineapple and a hint of kale. So I asked for spinach and celery instead of apples... ...which is why I'm writing this review from the shitter.    Pineapple, apple, kale, celery, and spinach is like the panic button for your lower intestine ... TRUST ME! ... One star for you!  I also ordered the southwest chicken panini... Should be safe, right?! Ok, I'll give you that one because it might just be the only thing soaking up some of the predigested bat urine you made me drink.   The very fact that my dumbass will be back there next week (damn commitment to eat healthier!) gets you a solid three stars. But I'm warning you, if your eyes don't S-C-R-E-A-M, \"I've got carrots!\" I'm going to burger king, Britney!"}
{"text":"When you're coming in from a flight that only provides small snacks & no food, Jugo Juice is the perfect refreshment! To me at least, I was pleased to find this right in front of my gate while waiting because it was something I needed to fuel my body on the go. Something healthy, something good. Compared to all airport eats & restaurants, this was the closest \"good\" spot to grab your natural ingredients in one.  Service: I'm sorry to have come here RIGHT when they were about to close, but I wanted something healthy, chocolatey or fruity. I tried ordering one of their pb smoothies, but the lady said she couldn't make it because certain tools were put away already. She had informed me that I could only order from the fruit or greens menu. Again with the service at this airport, I do not know what is up with these workers, but you gotta help the ones that are coming from another country. I asked her what their most popular or good smoothie is under the menu she had me choose from & she did not hesitate to say \"berry banana.\" It seemed like she didn't even think twice about what's good & just said it just to rush herself out of there.   Verdict: Berry banana, was berry alright. I can make smoothies at home & this tasted like tossed berries, bananas, & ice in it. Nothing else. I'll give the credit for the amount that was given, but it was a simple smoothie, good enough for my fruit intake for the day.   I'd come back for their nutritional smoothies on a delayed flight, but not for their service."}
