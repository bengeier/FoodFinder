{"text":"Food is pretty good. Service is slow. But the quality of food is better then most Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"The customer service is so bad! We had a party of 10 looked like a storage area. When we asked to be moved, they were very hesitant and didn't want to. The second time when we asked, they agreed. The waitress told us to carry our water jugs with us which we did not do.  Once we got to the seats we were moved to, we asked for water jugs and the waitress said, \"you didn't bring your water over from the other table?\" The water was not brought over to us and we ended up moving it ourselves. They were extremely slow with coming to take our order. We did not get served as fast as the 'indian' people coming in as we were of a different race. The food took so long to come. The portions are very dinky! The server was not happy to serve for sure. There was no smile on her face either. The washrooms are disgusting and smelly. Def not a place I will be coming back to. I will give them minus 100 stars if I could. The only positive thing I could say is the food was alright. At the end when we wanted to pay, she didn't give us a bill and was so confused. They got our order correct atleast. No tip was left! They didn't deserve it."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, I love their butter chicken!! But sometimes, it diesn't taste as fresh. What I hate about the restaurant is that the toilets are dirty and they smell, and the service, honestly, is not good. they just throw your stuffs at the table which is really rude. It's sad to see that the service is not good because the food is actually nice"}
{"text":"Even I'm finding tough to give 1 star for this restaurant. I would love to give -5 for their service and greeting customers. I would never step back here. I don't care if they serve a good taste food, if they don't offer good service to customers... FOR THE OWNER... PLEASE FIRST LEARN GREETING CUSTOMERS AND OFFER GOOD SERVICE AND COME BACK TO DO BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic food, very inexpensive, and good service.  A large pint of beer and more food than one person can eat for only $15!"}
{"text":"Miam! Le restaurant India Beau Village est l'un de mes restos indiens favoris.

L'endroit est très grand ce qui permet d'y aller entre amis sans même réserver. On y va certainement pas pour la déco : anciennement un resto grec (on y trouve encore certains items), encore du papier sur les nouvelles chaises, bref, ça fait un peu broche à foin. 

Par contre, les thalis sont très bons et abordables (entre 7 - 9$) et plusieurs plats végétariens sont offerts. Pour ceux qui trouvent la nourriture indienne trop épicée, on peut choisir le niveau d'épices (doux, moyen, épicé). De plus, on peut faire une commande pour emporter, mais le resto n'offre pas de livraison.

Mes coups de coeur: les pakoras aux légumes, les samosas, le poulet au beurre, le mixed vegetables et le channa. 

Seuls bémols: il est très difficile de se faire servir en français et ce n'est pas un \"apportez votre vin\"."}
{"text":"The food is the best version of Punjabi food I've tasted in Montreal, please try the Chana Samosa,  Aloo Paratha,  and Chicken Tikka  The service is lightyears if what it was 6 months ago!"}
{"text":"The customer service is so bad we give the Oder some food and mango lassi am waiting my food approximately 45 min very bad"}
{"text":"The food is simply perfect, there is no better adjective for it, every dish is cooked to perfection and to order with level of spiciness. 

The chicken Tikka Masala is their star dish, the chicken, onions and peppers are seared in heat before marinating in the sauce. Amazing.

Their other standout is the Biryani, a thing of beauty to behold and to taste.
I have taken 2 friends that used to eat the same dish cheaper at Saana across the street and they never went back to Saana.
The fish Pakora is incredible, the fish moist and fresh and the seasoning just rightly delicate.

I have been eating here since they opened about 12-13 years ago and have had EVERY single item on their menu, the only things i don't like is their curry ( too much tamarind) \"chicken and cheese curry\" (pieces are small) and spinach dishes ( not my style ). 

There is better Naan bread out there too, it's just a 3.5 out of 5 so not a huge deal

They recently moved to a larger restaurant about a block away, butt their prices are still decent, it would be nice if they renovated a bit. 

I take it to go 9 times out of 10, but the atmosphere and decor will leave some cold.

Malhi Sweet and Dera on Jarry have really stepped it up in that aspect, and the places on Jean-Talon have done some major renovations as well.

I still give it 5 stars,as those issues are very minor to me and it is an improvement over the old place."}
{"text":"Indian food there doesn't impress me. Only naan and fishes pakoras are good. The remaining: curry, korma, tikka, vindaloo contains more sauce than meat. It is not relevant compared to Bombay Palace on Jean Talon W."}
{"text":"For what it costs this place is the best. 

Huge restaurant with lots of tables always empty. Thalis and pakoras are great. 

There is free parking on the side."}
{"text":"If I could give an -10 I would horrible service, we couldn't get a table for 10 and the place was empty, they put as in a corner then we asked again getting annoyed and they moved us.  We asked for water and they said why didn't you bring it from the other table.  The employees weren't happy taking our order.  Who was ever in the back sounded like a party in the kitchen.  -10"}
{"text":"They have  the most horrible service. If ever u book a party type thing there expect to go in and have nothing done no napkins on the table nothing they got no organisation and they're pretty rude. Multiple time they over charge for no reason. Honestly pretty horrible. Disappointment"}
{"text":"The food in this quaint Indian place is delicious, however the service, cleanliness, decor and ambiance are very poor. From the dim-lit room to the loud music and confused waitresses, I'd say get takeout from here  only. The Chana Bhatura and all the Thalis here are very good."}
{"text":"Food is okay. 
SERVICE IS AWFUL. Waitress was completely condescending and seemed annoyed for having to come in to work that day. She was rude from the getgo when we came in as a group of 10.

We were seated in some storage area and when we asked to be moved to a booth, she was even more annoyed. Upon being seated, not only did she take FOREVER to take our orders, when we asked for water, She had the balls to ask \"didn't you bring your water jugs from the first table?\".

She sucked, the place was old and gross, booths were stained and there was no sense of atmosphere  (no music nothing - awkwardly eating in silence).

Wouldn't recommend - unless you want to be treated like shit :)"}
{"text":"Décor et toilettes horribles et sales.
Service d'un ridicule inégalé.
Mais, bonne bouffe et prix raisonnable.
On y vas une fois et on va ailleurs, où on y retourne en sachant à quoi s'attendre..."}
