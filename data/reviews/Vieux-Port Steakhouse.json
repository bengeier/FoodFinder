{"text":"Recommend by front desk at our hotel and we really loved this place. Nicely decorated and our waitress was very friendly and told my husband if he didn't like his bison steak she would get him another steak. He was unsure if he would like bison steak, but he said it was amazing! We followed up with the creme brûlée which was out of this world and even though we were full from our steaks we managed to polish it off."}
{"text":"We were a large group that come from Toronto to have dinner here.   An initial attempt to secure a group reservation was not successful.  After all the individual families booked this restaurant separately, they then nicely accommodated us to seat us together only if we were able to leave by 7pm.  The servers reminded us several time and was quick to take our order.  The food came quickly and was pretty good.  Instead of 4 stars, I deducted it by 2 star due this one server.  She was hostile to all of us, had this attitude of disdain, and was just not customer centric.   She flat rightly denied a request for a a steak to be butterflied  while another server said of course we can do that.  I get that you might be having a bad day but working in a service industry, this server should have minimally delivered on a reasonable customer experience...such as a genuine smile and refilling water.   Basic standards right?  Good thing the other servers weren't like that."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meat sauce I ordered was the worst one I ever tasted. My daughter didn't even touch it. However they made it up to me. My husband ordered a steak and that was the best dish I ever tasted in my life the price was about $37.  !"}
{"text":"Review is for lunch only.  We were really looking forward to trying this place after our morning at the Science Center.  Unfortunately, the service was pretty below average and the food just ok.  It took our waitress what seemed like 5 minutes to come to our table - and there were only a few tables as this was the after lunch rush......It didn't get much better from there as she seemed very uninterested and actually had other servers bring our food or offer refills. For starters - the Diablo Calamari (calamari was cooked perfectly not tough at all and the diablo sauce had just the right amount of kick to it) and the Lobster Bisque (lukewarm and just ok in flavor). For main courses - Mixed Grill of sausage (very dry and over cooked), flank steak (no flavor and well done in lieu of the ordered MR) and chicken (best of the 3).  Cheeseburger and fries for our son - he loved the fries.  Snail appetizer - average only. Not sure if we would give it another shot at dinner with so many other great places with great service around Montreal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice........waiter was great......do not order the NY strip, over cooked and more than half of it was fat"}
{"text":"The service was terrible (the host took 5 minutes to acknowledge us when we first came in, waiters kept bumping into our chairs and messing up our orders), the food was mediocre at best (we ordered the NY strip with scallops, and appetizers of pan-seared scallops and crab cakes), the tables were nauseatingly close to one another.   There are definitely better places in Montreal than this, skip it."}
{"text":"Just had Christmas eve dinner with the family here.  Great food and great service.  Paolo who took care of our table was just awesome and certainly made the experience a pleasantly memorable one."}
{"text":"Great for a long languid brunch, beautiful interior. Slow on the coffee service but once they know you, it all seems to come together quite nicely. I'm still thinking about the lovely prawns they had available.. Make sure you keep room for desert!"}
{"text":"Steaks were better than average for the price but cooked the way I requested.  String beans were over cooked and garlic mash potatoes was missing the garlic.  Service was good but nothing exceptional.    Overall, it satisfied the craving for steak but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Overall 4.5 the lobster soup was little bit salty but still tasty. The medium sirloin steak was little bit over cook , this is where the 0.5 went off. The environment and the services were good!"}
{"text":"We went in for the Sunday brunch today. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation but were seated right away. The place got crowded at 12ish but it was quiet/okay before that.  Honestly, we got more than for our money. Good quality food (but not amazing, hey it's a buffet!). Sausages, bacon and ham were very good according to my friend.  Bagels, pancakes, toasts were good! Omelettes are made on request in front of you, mine was good. Smoked salmon, salads, cheeses and pretty much everything were fresh. AMAZING croissants (trust me, I'm a connoisseur). Deserts were a little too sweet. Coffee was good, so were the juices. Hot meals weren't great though. We couldn't taste everything as we were more than full. Very good and friendly service (kept refilling my coffee and water, only had to ask once). Will def. return in 6 months, time to forget all I've eaten!"}
{"text":"I know, why order fish at a steakhouse?  All that being said, the first round was luke warm and overcooked.   The waiter, nicely trying to accommodate us, reordered and it was raw. The waiter involved the manager who compensated us for much of it, but really. 4 stars?  Cannot recommend it overall.  But the carpaccio was awesome !"}
{"text":"We went here for the brunch menu and left stuffed. I wish I had room for more desserts. Friendly staff and good service. There was a great array of breakfast and lunch selection (eggs, pancakes, omelette, pasta, beef roast) but nothing out of the ordinary. There was no lobster or good seafood options which disappointed me. What they had was solid in my opinion but I've had better brunches elsewhere. But for the price, I guess what you get here is fair."}
{"text":"Good service. Great filet wrapped with bacon. Good wine selection. Attentive service. Menu selection includes tasty chicken and seafood dishes. Great all around steakhouse with unimaginative name :)"}
{"text":"The sirloin was tender, no taste and burned out, my friend got also two different sirloin one raw and the other well done, the black on them was so much that I think they don't clean between the cooking, and the dessert, was an orribile old and defrosted 5 cm high cheesecake good taste but bad consistency,  old prepared days before...overexpensive, for Christmas, hope they had in holidays their staff because service was terrible we had dirty dishes in front of us for an half an hour...Only plus for them is the atmosphere nice and chic, you pay the atmosphere not the quality neither a chef.never back again, never.went there because it was one of the few opened on holidays, better a chip China way better. OK in Italy I eat fassona,Chainina, kobe,  Angus, and this meat don't taste,  just tender but badly cooked, who has different review is an incompetent or paid by them don't have any other explanation, we was in 3 not one satisfied."}
{"text":"We throughly enjoyed our dinner with Alien!   Our food was amazing from the soup to dessert!  Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This was a really positive dining experience for my wife and I. The oysters were not great but the cherry vinegar was a nice change of pace.  My pork chop was cooked perfectly as was my wife's chicken. Just a very well executed meal.   The best part of the evening was the service. Our waiter was just that right balance of attending to our needs without hovering over us. We did not have to wait for anything service related but we also were not rushed at all. We were there for three hours without a problem.   My personal favorite part of the evening was when a young man at the table next to us tried to order filet mignon well done. I cried a little as I heard him place the order. The waiter did an excellent job of explaining how over cooking would effect the meat in a way that wasn't demeaning to the patron. The waiter could have just placed the order but the customer would have had a worse experience."}
{"text":"Really good meal.  The ribeyes were cooked to order and very flavorful.  The lobster bisque & lobster linguini were extremely good! Our waiter was attentive.    We were an older \"demographic\" and in Montreal to start a cruise tomorrow.  But we were treated as anticipated guests--not a one shot diner.    Wine list had a good variety and the cocktail was generous.  We felt really lucky to stop in here.  Atmosphere was good.  Music at a nice level."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was decent.  The filet medallions were very good.  The creme brulee was disgusting.  They completely overcooked it--turned into a sugared-scrambled eggs desert.  It was so bad that it ruined my meal.  The next night we went to The Keg, which was better in every way (it's right down the block)."}
{"text":"Amazing! We were a few of many Anglos in the restaurant. Our waiter was French but fluent in English and very helpful. My friend and I got the 12oz rib steak and it was succulent. Oysters were great. Wine was great. The restaurant decor was beautiful."}
{"text":"Gorgeous sunny summer day in July strolling around Old Montreal came upon this wonderful restaurant with a lovely outdoor terrasse. Young waiter came over to us right away took our drink order (beer for the hubby,  house red wine for me ) $8 each which was very respectable we both selected from the lunch menu at $15.50 which had a choice of daily soup (creme of corn) or small mixed green salad hubby took the soup,  I had the salad.   He enjoyed his soup,  my salad was OK , just the usual greens you can get in a large container at the grocery store.  Out of the 4 or 5 main courses,  he chose the  grilled salmon which came with wild rice and mixed steamed vegetables I took the grilled chicken breast which had the same drizzled mustard sauce as the salmon and steamed vegetables but my plate came with French fries.  For desert there were 2 choices: creme brulee or chocolate mousse so we took one of each - both were delicious! Overall a very good experience  which we will definitely repeat and recommend it to others"}
{"text":"A tourist restaurant with low quality food. Don't bother go off the beaten path for a much finer dining experience."}
{"text":"We were actually looking forward to having a meal at The Keg. However, by mistake we walked into The Steakhouse which is right next door to The Keg!  My medium rare steak came out well done... Their tomato bisque was  pretty good. The redeeming quality was the service. We had a very nice server, who was quite attentive."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and ambience is classy but not too classy. The food and service was good but there was nothing spectacular about the steaks. I would've liked to try the other places around that area"}
{"text":"I had the 3 peppercorn NY style steak, and was quite impressed! The service and ambience were quite great as well. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were engaged in Montreal, and the first night we were ever there as a couple (seven years ago), we decided to head off to dinner Vieux-Port Steakhouse.  It was close to our hotel and I remember we were starving.  To make a long story short, we never had the chance to actually eat there because moments after we sat down, I passed out.  I was probably just hungry and tired, but I ended up just wanting to head back to the hotel.   Dinner there never happened that night. . . but we made sure that it did our first night in Montreal this past weekend!  I had scoped out the menu before just to make sure there were some options for vegan, gluten-free me.  It was more important for me to actually go to this restaurant for sentimental purposes rather than for the food, so I was pretty content to just get some sort of salad and maybe a few sides.  Since the menu did feature a vegan salad and some sides I could work with, I was totally content with my options.  We arrived and had no trouble being seated immediately (we did make a reservation), despite the fact it was super busy.  We decided to order our food all at once since we were starving at this point.  I ordered a house mesclun salad with a Dijon dressing.  As far as salads go, it was pretty unimpressive--just some lettuce and onions basically, but at least the dressing was tasty!  I also devoured a side of garlic spinach.  It was really flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Of course, French fries were a must.  Unfortunately, they were pretty bad--they tasted like they were frozen and they were a bit overcooked.  Oh, and they came out cold.  As expected, the vegan and gluten-free food options they served were pretty mediocre, but again, we went there for sentimental reasons, not for the food.  My husband did enjoy his steak though, so at least the steak was good, given the fact it was a steakhouse!  The service, on the other hand, was excellent, and most importantly, the time we spent there together, reminiscing, was priceless!  I would go back there in a heartbeat--if only to re-live the night I fainted in a restaurant, only to become engaged moments later."}
{"text":"I planned an event here, 28 people, had a great evening.  The planning went very well -the coordinator worked with me to put together a nice menu.  The room was perfect, surrounded by history, top floor in a beautifully set room. The food, for the most was delish.  Perfectly done filet mignons,  nicely flavoured grilled halibut.  The soup, a little grainy and the salad seemed off, maybe not dressed enough, but now I'm being picky.  We were well taken care of from start to finish."}
{"text":"Très bon steak house. Il y a même un feu de cheminée. Cependant je ne recommande pas le baseball steakhouse"}
{"text":"we went here for sunday brunch....WOW!  when you walk up to the door they do look closed but that is because brunch is upstairs. we we were escorted to our table and quickly greeted by our server. she asked if we would like some oj and if we would like a big glass.  the brunch is huge.  salads, lox, egg station, soups and over 10 hot dishes and a craving station with prime rib .  very good !  i love the upstairs vibe. very french chalet."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday party, and it's terrible. More up all than a car dealership- and about the same price."}
{"text":"We went to vieux-porte steakhouse late on a weekday. We had excellent service, great steaks. Lobster tail was nice. My only comment would be that when i walked in and greeted the men standing behind the host table, they were a little rude. Apparently, they were not the hosts, but failed to mention that I was just stood there idly."}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal , I know there's lots of steakhouse out there but as I were in the old port , we decided to go there in a whim ..  It was a really good choice we appreciated the place it was classy the food presentation was gorgeous and tasty really awesome steak even if I only took a basic steak .. My gf took the salmon and it was amazing as well , we had a great time out there and I'm definitely planing on going again.   It was a little pricey but not bad in regard of quality of food and service !   5 star no doubt."}
{"text":"Great romantic well lit environment. Food was good service was amazing. Their staff is definitely top notch. Looking for a great restaurant with a small group of ppl I would definitely send u there."}
{"text":"It was a cold winter night in old montreal when we ventured into this long standing indie steakhouse.  It was packed when we walked in at 8:45pm on all 3 levels.  The decor is urban lodge upscale and the ambiance is casual.  Service is friendly but the steak trimmings and accompaniments were nothing memorable and quite ordinary.  Aside the good decor and ambiance; we wouldn't go out of our way for a repeat visit.  The Mac and cheese was fancy KD with cheese on top; the beef carpaccio was excellent.  The steaks were good but had to send mine twice as it was way too rare each time."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are because the restaurant 's prices were low in comparison to the food quality. We had lunch. The table d'hôte was extremely well priced with excellent choices. The terrasse was quite nice. The steaks were cooked properly. Service was very fast. No problem with lingering. I had the mixed grill. Lamb chops were great. Steak nice and tender. Chicken a little dry- the problem wit skinless boneless chicken breast. Portions large enough that it didn't matter to me.   Nice place in Vieux Montreal."}
{"text":"Je suis tombé sur ce restaurant par hasard. Dans cette rue piétonne, il y a beaucoup de touristes et aussi beaucoup de restaurants. Le décors est jolie. Le restaurant à une grande surface et une bonne organisation afin de permettre aux gens qui désirent manger de ne pas attendre trop longtemps. La cuisine est un mélange de viande et de poissons."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal Mid July for vacation and to celebrate my friend's birthday.  The food was nothing spectacular. My son's burger was a little charred (he said it tasted burnt) as if they didn't clean the grill or scrap it after cooking all day on it. The server put in the wrong order for my friend and she had to wait for her main while the rest in the party were eating. The server did apologize, but for such an upscale and pricey menu, the manager should at least come by to apologize. The restaurant wasn't that busy.  I went there based on the reviews on Yelp, but my experience was a little to be desired."}
{"text":"I went here for my boyfriends birthday and had a mixed experience. The food was really good - we had French onion soups to start, then the chicken breast with feta and pork osso bucco. Everything was super tasty. I did have to return my chicken because it was cold, but once that was resolved, everything was fine.   The down side of our visit were the staff. The hostess was somewhat rude when I asked about the wait time for the patio, and our waiter was just a bit odd and completely forgot about us for about 20 minutes after we were done eating so we had to call him over to get his attention.  Also, I mentioned on the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday and they completely did not even acknowledge it. On every other steakhouse I've been to they'd normally give you a free dessert or something else for birthdays.  Overall, food was pretty good but disappointing service."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, lovely setting, excellent service.  The best meal we had during our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of old town you would expect a restaurant like this to cater to tourist and businessmen.  The first knock was that sat me in a corner in the back of the restaurant away from the street and view because I was eating alone I can only assume.  The waitress treated as if I was a ignorant fool.  The lobster bisque was thin an by far the worst I've had.  I explicitly stated that the steak should be rare border line uncooked.  What was brought out was medium. I should have went to the KEG next door.  Save your meal and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here for the Montréal à la Table event on 2013, and therefore my review for the place might not be as accurate as other Yelpers. Considering that a soup, a thick 8oz steak, and a dessert cost only 20$ on the special menu, it was not expensive at all. However, glancing at their regular menu, one would notice that some dishes are significantly more pricey than other places.  Reservations may be made online, and can be modified or cancelled at anytime, which I found really convenient.  My girlfriend and I were seated near the window of the third floor, the view was great, and I loved the romantic ambience with the dimly lit environment and the soft music in the background. We were the only table at that floor, so it was really quiet (the dining hall at the ground floor was slightly loud). The service was personal, caring, fast, and efficient.  The Vegetable Velouté Soup was creamy, rich, and well seasoned. The steak was a PERFECTLY cooked medium-rare, well rested, juicy, tender, and full of flavour. It was a very thick cut and yet it was medium-rare though out, not overcooked at all on the outside. I could not help myself smiling while savouring that piece of meat, yes it was that good. The steamed green beans were not so enjoyable, most of them were filled with tough strings and was difficult to eat.  My girlfriend had the pasta with grilled jumbo shrimp, it was not as spectacular as the steak but also quite succulent. The pasta were freshly made and cooked al dente, the shrimps were just slightly overcooked, but the wonderful sweetness of the shrimp itself makes up for that. I found the pasta had too much mint, and was overpowering other flavours.  The chocolate cake was delightful, but not too spectacular.  Final verdict: great place with amazing atmosphere, at least from what I have experienced. I did not encounter any negative experience as other Yelpers did, perhaps it was our lucky night. However one thing is certain: this place is not your average steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhhh.  My friend said it best. It's a mediocre restaurant attempting to wear the costume of a white glove restaurant. Yes, it's a very nice place but more than that...it's lacking.   I came with three friends to share a bottle of wine and a light bite and everything was just...blah. They kept saying they'll seat us in five minutes, and it took them about three rounds of saying five minutes to us before we got a table. The service is sloppy, like for example we were ordering food and talking to the waiter when the busgirl came by with a bread basket, saw we hadn't finished ordering, started walking away and in the middle of everything the waiter shouted \"give them bread!\" so that she would return...  The food took FOREVER to come out. We literally didn't order things that needed to be cooked- the fois gras and the salmon tartar. The tartar was bland, I thought the fois gras was okay.  Basically this place seems like a tourist trap, sneakily designed to look like a local spot. Skip it."}
{"text":"lunch recently, we sat at the bar in the back which was pretty empty for lunch but that was fine, a pretty good martini for canada and jonathan was helpful and courteous, salmon tartar very good and we enjoyed the caesar and the crevette grill, pretty place and we noticed very busy at night..."}
{"text":"Lobster Bisque Was Incredible! The server was great has been there for 12 years and made us feel at home! Spinach was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write a review about this place, while still at the restaurant. Part of the reason I am able to do this is bc of the inordinate amount of time I've had to wait for anything(right now just waiting for my check). Sitting was really quick, But! That's where it ended. It took more than 25 mns to get a menu (btw not a busy time). In fact, i watched as one of the bust boys had to point out to my waiter that i needed serving and I watched as the horror falls on his face. But again, didn't make a difference bc this behavior continues throughout my meal. He came and dropped off the menu, but took a long time before he came to get my order. Then my food came. 15 seconds later I realized I wanted some black pepper, but my waiter was long gone. No fret! I thought. The floor manager is serving pepper to the couple right in front of me. I waved around like a maniac, then had to yell in French(as he was walking away) before he saw me and brought me some peppers. (Is that it?! Am I blending in somehow. I mean I am brown, but I didn't realize I blended with the shadows...anyway). So he brings me the pepper. And I think ok, still not that bad. It took another 20 mns after I finished my food for the waiter to come back. Then he said it's bc he was waiting on me. Yeah sure. The point of this is not to trash them but to say that a place with such a nice ambiance shouldn't be brought down by bad service. My food was put in a to-go bag. It's been another 20mns. So I'll see how long before I catch his attention, just so I can get my check."}
{"text":"Came her for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night.  Made a reservation for 4 people in the car on the way there via a link on their website.  When we arrived, we were seated immediately.  The cozy atmosphere was great: dim lights, warm fireplace, very romantic.  I had the opportunity to try their steak, lobster tail, chicken, and salmon.  I only have one word for the quality of their food:  WOW.  Although I had asked for the steak well done, it came out medium well and was so juicy and tender.  The lobster tail was cooked and seasoned just perfectly, as were the chicken and salmon.  We tried the creme brule and chocolate cake for dessert.  They were fantastic.  The cake was more of a mousse than a cake.  Overall the service was a tad slow but our waiter was super nice.  I prefer this place over the keg anytime because of the cozy atmosphere, scrumptious food, and pleasant staff.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was the first and definitely the last visit of this stake house in Old Montreal. I was in Montreal for a couple of days with my boyfriend. We had a choice between this place and another popular stake house, which is next door from Vieux-Port. After a short period of discussion we preferred to try this place, because the other one was already experienced by us last time.  So, right after the waiter escorted us to our table I went to the washroom to powder my nose and got shocked with the condition of the restroom. It was obviously low maintained: small pieces of toilet paper were all over the floor, the dispenser for paper in one of the cabins was broken and opened, unpleasant smell was all over the room. The environment of that place resembled me the one they have on cheap gas stations far away from civilization.  The food was average. I won't say that was the best steak I have ever tried, but it wasn't bad. I also had soup of the day, it was mushroom soup, nothing different from Campbells you can buy at any grocery store. For desert I chose Danish pie, which I didn't taste like freshly made.  The staff was trying hard to act like professionals, at moments stepping out from their roles and laughing loud with each other at the corner.  Generally speaking, don't expect to much from this place. It's overpriced and definitely doesn't worth you an evening. There are many other better places to dine at."}
{"text":"Good food. Manufactured atmosphere. Insincere service.   We stumbled upon this restaurant while walking Old Montreal on a cold Thursday evening in November. That night the restaurant appeared warm and romantic. We made reservations for Friday and requested a table near the fireplace.   Upon arriving Friday night, we were seated upstairs near a fireplace even though downstairs wasn't full. Unfortunately, upstairs was decidedly more casual, loud and touristy. There was a company Christmas party going on in a banquet room just on the other side of a door by our table. Load music and shrieking cheers from partygoers competed with the restaurant's already-too-loud background music making it impossible to have an intimate discussion.   Our food arrived quickly and was delicious. We shared a Caesar salad, French onion soup, and filet medallions wrapped in bacon.  The salad was fresh but average in flavor. The soup broth had a rich flavor, however the added bread became too soggy too fast. The medallions, served with garlic mashed potatoes and a mushroom sauce, were definitely the highlight, cooked perfectly at medium-rare.   We didn't stay for dessert or digestifs, as the continued competing atmospheres and lackluster service was less than impressive. From seating to departure, we were there just 45 minutes. Not what we had wants from our romantic evening out. As we left, no one inquired as to our experience, though there were at least 2 hostesses and one who appeared to be the manager, standing at the entrance.   We will not return to this restaurant and would not recommend it for a romantic weekend dinner, especially during holiday season."}
{"text":"Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect."}
{"text":"This was an anniversary! I had walked passed this restaurant many times but never happened to dine in it. We got there on a Sunday night, as expected not so busy. Well lit with a warm ambiance and a fireplace with burning woods all I needed to feel alive and romantic! We both ordered soup of the day (tomato soup) top sirloin steak with mashed potato and vegetables and the super yummy chocolate mousse cake as desert  I also had a double espressos  The steak was as medium rare as i expected! The mushroom sauce made a good combination  All in all the food was satisfying. The waiter was also so nice and congenial he served us well and we also enjoyed his sense of humor! I'll definitely visit again  Forgot to mention, i paid about 120 CAD for all the food with two drinks including tax and tip which is just fair I say!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last Wednesday evening, while in town.The service was decent, but we did get a slight miss (I ordered fish and was delivered steak initially). World class ambiance, and great tasting food,"}
{"text":"ENGLISH BELOW Un bon restaurant pour aller dîner ou souper. Le décor colonial en pierre est plaisant, il y a beaucoup d'uvres d'art et le restaurant est climatisé. Le linguini au homard que j'ai pris était exquis tout comme la soupe au courge. Les serveurs sont polis et serviables. Je recommence les  A great restaurant to go for lunch or dinner. The artworks blend very well with the colonial stone architecture. The lobster linguini I took was exquisite as was the squash soup. The waiters were polite and obliging. I recommend"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ! J'ai pris une salade au saumon en entrée, un saumon fumé avec du riz sauvage comme plat principal et une crème brûlée en dessert ! Tout était super bon, mon copain a beaucoup aimé aussi ! Bien sûre nous avons opté pour la table d'hôte (sinon les prix sont assez élevés) donc c'était 27$ par personne. Le décor est sombre, mais ça va avec le concept. S'il fait super froid dehors, ne vous mettez pas à côté de la fenêtre, vous allez grave geler ! Le service était ordinaire, rien de special.."}
{"text":"Went there on a double date. Everyone got the salmon tartar to start, this was the only good plate. For mains we got fillet minion medallions, sirloin NY cut, sirloin baseball cut and Santa Fe chicken. Only the chicken was good. Regarding the steaks they were all inconsistent. We got out meals medium rare, the fillet mignon was medium/well done, the two sirloins were rare. The deserts creme brule and chocolate mousse tasted like plastic and were worse than Costco's. My girlfriend who just loves deserts, didn't finish hers. This is the first time I see this.  At $50/person (had a bottle of wine) I expect decent service. However, our waiter was cracking jokes with the barman instead of attending. He wasn't the one bringing the food to the table and never passed by to ask if we needed anything. With so many other excellent Steakhouses in Montreal I would put this at the bottom of my list. It was just disappointing."}
{"text":"Vieux-Port Steakhouse is a bit pricey for my taste, but overall a solid restaurant. They have ample seating indoors and out, and the wait staff is attentive and helpful.  I am not big on steak, but my family and I were desperate for something to eat and had already walked around to find long waits at other restaurants. From what I can tell, it's a fantastic spot for a nice steak, but I stuck with the Mac & Cheese baked with bacon and ham :)   They also have some great, fun drink specials, and a healthy smattering of various beers on tap.   If you get a chance to sit outside and the weather is agreeable, go for it, because the outdoor seating is relaxing and presents a nice break from the hubbub of the interior dining experience.   Also, our waiter knew 5 languages! How insane is that??"}
{"text":"We were at the maple syrup store across from this restaurant and decided to stop by to enjoy a nice steak dinner to celebrate our anniversary. I looked up Yelp reviews and just hesistant because it gets only 3.5 stars. Anyways, we wanted to get out of the rain too and the restaurant seems like a good crowd too, we decided to try it.  We ordered the lobster bisque, french onion soup, bone-in ribeye and lamb chops and french bordeaux wine. I enjoyed the delicious creamy lobster bisque. The french onion soup was average. Ribeye steak was thin cut and we would much prefer the usual thicker cut. Lamb chops was good, can use more seasonings and herbs for taste. Meats were cooked according to our requests of medium-rare and medium. We would rate the food quality as 3.5 stars. Quantity is plenty as it comes with mashed potatoes or wild rice and vegetables. The bordeaux wine was excellent, although quite pricey at CAD$40+ for half carafe. The service we received from our server, Paul, was impressive. He is very attentive, constantly checked on us to see if we need anything or if the food is up to our expectations. He is always with smiles and has a warm personality. The restaurant was really busy and he was serving many tables around us but yet, he comes around to check on us. He even offered to call us a cab for the ride back home. For Paul, we will give him 5 stars!  The restaurant has a nice interior decor and huge sitting area on seperate floors. Overall, we enjoy our experience at Vieux-Port Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Ouch.  Two stars for this one, and only because our waiter was friendly and tried to be helpful.  He was very enthusiastic about the upsell and suggesting of things, which can be great when they talk you in to something good.  Pretty much everything else was not so good.  We got the pricey seafood platter to start (at a not-so-cheap $50), and found everything to be astoundingly overcooked.  Scallops don't like being overcooked, and we ended up returning them and the shrimp because they were pretty rubbery.  At this point I go upstairs to the bathroom, which definitely needed attention.  It's a \"nice\" restaurant, so they ought to have someone go in and maybe unclog the urinals occasionally.  Ought to because they didn't.  With things seeming to be on a rapid decline, our steaks arrived.  Medium-rare has never looked so solidly brown, and the watery spinach side wasn't helping.  We sent one of them back entirely, as pretty much any chance of recovering the dining experience had passed.  On second thought, one star.  Because it was terrible."}
{"text":"French Onion soup was a HUGE disappointment.  This is my favorite soup and I order it where ever I go.  I was excited to try it in Montreal.  Mistake. It tasted like ramen noodle broth.   Salty with hardly any robust onion soup flavor. There was barely any onion (maybe 10 tiny pieces in the entire bowl) and way too much bread.  The bowl was filled with chunks of bread as opposed to a nice thick slice on the top. I had a bite or two then just ate the cheese off th top. That being said we really enjoyed the rest of our meal. The steak was great, my husband loved his lamb. The best part was the chocolate mouse cake for dessert. The only thing I was upset about was that I didn't have enough room to finish my dessert."}
{"text":"Bon jour, hello.  I was wandering around Montreal and thought it was time for a little wine and lunch.  I popped in, had a glass of sparkling and ordererd the salmon.  The restaurant was fairly empty.  My lunch was really good, maybe not so memorable but I have my photo to help me remember.  I do remember liking the rice in the middle of the plate.  I also remember a table full of business men drinking grappa at a nearby table and I wanted to join them so badly.  But I refrained."}
{"text":"Many mistakes done between my drink being  returned twice which I gave up after that then the food was ok and the waiter was ok though he also forgot my meal when my peers got theirs!"}
{"text":"A solid dining experience. I was exploring the old town (which is great, by the way) and dropped into this place for dinner. It was your typical solo dining experience and fare. A glass of Chablis, iceberg lettuce wedge and miso glazed black cod with wild rice and garlic spinach. The latter was terrific. They didn't overdo the miso which made for a gentle, almost maple type flavor. Same for the garlic in the spinach, not overdone. Service was attentive without being pestering. All in all, nothing bad to say. I would certainly recommend it"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot - we liked the patio, the service was excellent and they were good with us bringing 6 year old kids x3 plus a younger one in. The kids meals were great and inexpensive, and the adult fare were better than most you can get in old Montreal. I would recommend it for those looking for decent meal after or during a tourist trek."}
{"text":"I rate this restaurant from my Mtl à Table dining experience, so quality  may differ from mainstream menu.  The set menu was 21$ for a three course meal : I ordered a tuna tartar, steak with side of vegetables and vanilla cake with pear and caramel.  Overall experience: you get what you pay for, presentation was poor, food was served late and cold (due to the high volume of people) steak was prepared to my liking (medium rare) and dessert was the highlight of the whole meal. The suggested wine pairings were good.  I had higher expectations for this place for an old Port location - won't come back. On top of that they canceled my open table reservation when I showed up!!   Better options available in the Port."}
{"text":"While walking through Montreal's Old Port section we came upon the Vieux-Port Steakhouse. We decided to go in for an early dinner. We ordered from the special table d'hote menu which is available up to 6:00 PM. We had a choice of salad or soup, 4 entree's plus dessert.  We both chose the caesar salad and a 12 oz bone in rib steak.. The rib steak was served with french fries & mixed veggies. Cost was $28. The dinner menu is more costly. Everything was excellent. Certainly a place we would return to when in Montreal.."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow and spent most of his time chatting with another table close by. I contacted the restaurant in advance to make sure they could deal with gluten and dairy allergies and they told me yes. Someone in the group mentioned their allergies when he took our orders - their steak arrived with a piece of butter melting on top. I don't think he even took down the allergies for the kitchen."}
{"text":"Terrible service... so disappointed. :(( I'm planning a big new year celebration with family and frds and planning to be about 10-13 people, however when calling to book to reserve, I encountered really terrible service, and the hostess was asking for my credit card number for the reservation. I find it not acceptable as we are just a dozen of people and not a group of 50 ppl. just so frustrated at this experience and definitely looking for another place to have brunch instead. This restaurant just sound like they don't care about my business, why bother and im sure we can find better brunch places in Town from now on to celebrate :)"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch: great assortment of breakfast items, and equal share of lunch, salads, fruits, and dessert items. Only thing I can think of to make it better would be more than 1 soup, but that's nit-picking. Great buffet, and price at $32 (Canadian) quite reasonable. Great friendly staff.  Will return it next trip."}
{"text":"Vieux port steakhouse is one of those places you remember, great ambiance, warm fireplace, elegant and best of all delicious steaks and escargots. The spiked hot tea with grand marinier definitely hit the spot on this 27degree day. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Happening Gourmand in Old Montreal and I can see why they want to promote the area in the Winter: It's FREEZING near the water.  I went over all the places that participated in the promotion and this one had the best selection and their prices were unbeatable.  I had no idea how huge and classy this place was, and not too dark like other steakhouses.  The special menu included, a choice of appetizers,chose the escargot (hard to find nowadays), a baseball cut sirloin steak was small and was accompanied by fries and veggies as well as a slice of cheesecake. All for $21  Overall very impressed, the service was very quick and efficient, I also had a cocktail drink,the mint condition, which I enjoyed.  I will definitely be back to try out the rest of their offerings, but in the summer."}
{"text":"Great service! My wife and I sat at the bar and were tended to by Joe. He was great! Very friendly and also gave us a tour of the building at the end of our meal. Highly recommend this place. Ask for Joe"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very good service.  We waited awhile for the food but it was such a great restaurant we didn't mind and enjoyed a slower paced lunch.   I ordered the seafood platter and while the grilled flavors were great everything was slightly over cooked and a bit tough especially the lobster and scallops.   The lobster bisque was lovely, my daughter ordered the salmon and was quite pleased.  It was an enjoyable meal and everyone at the table was pleased with their orders!   I can recommend this place for an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"A perennial on the top ten steakhouses in Montreal, this restaurant earns its place there with everything you would expect - great steaks, lovely ambience and quality service. We visited on a Sunday night so it wasn't too busy. Our waiter, Omar, seemed inexperienced but didn't make any mistakes so at least he was well trained. The wine list is not as extensive as other high end restaurants, and they lack a cellar, but there are plenty of reasonable options. We started off with two of the classics: the Caesar salad - very nice, though I prefer the pieces of lettuce smaller; and carpaccio - also very nice, but too much arugula and they shouldn't put tomatoes on it. The mains were even better. The beef tenderloin medallions were excellent - soft, perfectly cooked and juicy. The bison ribeye steak was fantastic - massive flavour, perfectly cooked and juicy with that bit of gamey chew you get with bison meat. I would order this again in a heartbeat! For dessert we settled on the chocolate cake - expectedly decadent and rich - washed down with some fine old port and cognac. because our mains took a while to arrive, the manager comped us a couple of Grand Marniers - nice touch, shows some class to take care of his customers. All in all, we were both very happy with our dinner here, and would be happy to return the next time we are in Montreal. Recommended!"}
{"text":"MEH. 2 1/2 stars but I'll upgrade it to 3 only because the waitress was nice. So this is me being nice back. You're welcome.  I was visiting old montreal for the second time and I was jonesing for buffalo steaks so we stumbled upon this place.   I was with a friend, and we weren't dressed fancy but the restaurant wasnt all fancy either and I was appaled they gave us crappy seats upstairs, all the way in the back, next to the brick wall next to some weird crook in the corner with crappy paint. Please, why don;t you just seat us in the bathroom and we'll use the toilet as the table.  I ordered the buffalo steak and oh my god, I swear I think it was a normal t-bone and charged me $30 for it. Thank god we ordered a bottle of wine so I was too drunk to notice how mediocre the food was.   great service, blah food, too pricey and crappy seats. Not a fan, not coming back. thanks"}
{"text":"First off, what a gorgeous restaurant! This place is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the touristy old port. The wait staff was friendly and attentive and they accommodated our huge dinner party. This may be a steak house but its owned by Greeks and it reflects in their menu. We started with the Pikilia, a hearty variety of seafood and vegetables and a perfect start to dinner. The salad came next and it wasn't the most fantastic but it was nice and refreshing. The waiter was kind enough to let me alter my main course, perfectly grilled salmon with sauteed greens and garlic mash.  One word of caution, this place is huge and I did get lost coming back from the washroom but I didn't mind because the restaurant was decorated so beautifully."}
{"text":"Wound up here after a long stroll along Vieux Port, lovely restaurant! We were seated in the patio area, just in time to enjoy watching a brief  early evening storm. Helped to bolster the romantic setting! We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay from the very attentive and friendly staff, an ice bucket was at the ready. we ordered up a cheese platter, salad, French Onion for the wife, a delicious cream of vegetable for myself, and well, I was craving a burger which sounded so god! (I would have ordered the filet mignon but was served plenty of that at the F1 Elite restaurant earlier that day)  So, this is a wonderful place to have a romantic evening with  your spouse/date, interior décor was old-style gorgeous as well, and the food and service is top notch. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I think this place deserves more credit than it gets. It doesn't make pretentious claims of being the best, nor does it price itself as if it were. Yet there is more substance than I would have expected from a tourist-friendly preposition like this one.  The $15 lunch table d'hôte must be one of the best value in town Mon-Sat. It's not a typo. I've been happy enough with the 7oz sirloin steak that I came back for it. It's a thick and lean cut, with just enough seasoning, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare like I ordered. Soup/salad and dessert are included, so the portion size is more than adequate for lunch.  I was pleased with the buffet brunch on Sunday as well. It was much more than a carb fest - meats of all kinds were available (roast pork and beef, ribs, smoked salmon, and mussels, just to name a few) in addition to omelettes prepared-to-order, soft waffles and berries. There were many sweets to choose from as well (crème brulée, cakes, etc.) though they were more filling than delightful. The ribs were interesting: not your traditional fall-off-the-bone BBQ-sauce ribs - those ones had the texture and taste of their steak.  I feel there is genuine attempt by Management to offer good service. As well, the cooking appears to be consistent. No hesitation in recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great Atmosphere!!! Excellent service!!! Steak was cooked perfectly!! The speed of the kitchen was great, not a long wait between courses!"}
{"text":"With many steakhouses to choose from in Montreal, you can't go wrong with this classy establishment. It is situated on one of the main tourist streets, steps away from the basilica and the waterfront.  I first ate here about 6 years ago and remembered it was fantastic so we sought it out again this past weekend.  I was thrilled that it was just as good as I remembered!  The decor is open and there is ample seating.  It does fill up so reservations are recommended.  The dress code is fancy casual - you will see tourists in jeans but also couples dressed up.  I suggest making an effort - you certainly don't need a tie but a collared shirt would be more in place than a t-shirt.  The waitstaff and management are impeccable.  All are bi-lingual but you are in Quebec so practice your Merci's and SVP!    The food is top notch!  Portions are huge but not overwhelming.  We had salmon filet with rice and spinach, a burger with fries, and beef filet mignon with baked potato.  All entrees were terrific - the steak is some of the best I have ever had.  The starters were good but not out of this world.  Please note there is no kid's menu because it is not really a place to bring toddlers and younger children.  They will, however, make an off menu pasta dish for young kids.  Older pre-teens and teens will be able to eat an adult entrée but you will pay full price.    Overall I highly recommend the Vieux Port Steakhouse if you are in the area.  Definitely try the steak!"}
{"text":"Very nice place! The food is exquisite, you will find a little bit of everything. Even though is a steady house they have vegan and vegetarian dishes. I was not disappointed.  My friend had the cod and he steak and coming from Argentina he was surprised on how the steak was well prepared.  The cod was also fresh and juicy.  I had fresh fettuccine with pomodoro pasta and fresh bell peppers with zucchini. The dish, even-though was pretty deep and big was so tasty I ate in two breaths... Will definitely return here next time!"}
{"text":"I work at Glen- Montreal Children's Hospital. When the end of year approaches, we need to let go. It's time for celebratory dinner, drinking, dancing ... to pay off our hard work.  A group of nurses, the organization... throw us a vibrant Christmas party. Vieux-port Steakhouse received us. It's a huge, three floor restaurant. We got the top floor, which includes the dance floor. The restaurant has the rustic decor. It feels cozy and warm since the cold has wrapped us.  We were 110 people; I was amazed the service was satisfactory. The waiters did their best to accommodate all of us in timely. To start off, we had bread. It was warm and soft. Then house salad, sadly it was soaked in the vinaigrette. Then the main dish, steak with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. Well cooked, and super delicious. Our table had wine, which was a bit too strong for my taste, so afterwards I ordered my favorite cocktail, whiskey with ginger ale. Then we had three layers chocolate mousse cake. It was light, fluffy and yummy.  The music was fantastic. The vibe was hyped up. Wonderful place for a party!"}
{"text":"we walked in because the smell emanating from the restaurant was too good to resist. awesome bison steak and bacon wrapped filets, the meat was so tender and cooked exactly as we had asked for. like another reviewer said, this place doesn't get enough credit for how good it really is. the warm goat cheese tower and crostini was decadent and the Caesar salad was literally dressed perfectly.   if you have enough room for dessert, the chocolate mousse dessert is light and just the right amount of sweet.   another plus-- though this place isn't wheelchair friendly, we watched three waiters carry a woman in her wheelchair up the stairs so she could sit where she wanted. our server was considerate enough to fit a piece of cardboard under the table legs as the table was wobbly (to be honest, I didn't even notice that the table was wobbly and was impressed that he went the extra mile). extremely good service and very nice ambience, candle lit, exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant ....something for each of the folks that numbered 8. This place stayed full. A great deal of folks here .  I have the grilled salmon it was excellent with rice pilaf and garlic spinach. It was fresh great food"}
{"text":"A couple of my friends and I took a road trip from Toronto to Montreal. Our hotel was in the heart of Vieux Montreal and one freezing night we decided to try this place out.   I was pleasantly surprised by the warm and welcoming decor since a \"hockey day\" was advertised outside. We were seated next to a fireplace and had a nice view of the street.   As we waited for the food we were brought a plate of delicious hot bread. The bread had a crunchy top and a soft, steaming middle and was a perfect little pick me up before the meal.   Here are the dished my friends and I ordered:  1) Tuna Steak with Asparagus and a small side salad: The tuna was pretty good, but I've had better. Most of the asparagus was done well except for one bigger piece which was a bit tough. My favorite part was the side salad which came with an amazing dressing.  2)  Lobster and Steak: my friend really liked it and finished off the entire plate. A pretty hefty piece of meat and a good sized lobster tail. The butter for the lobster was pretty darn good too.  3) Rack of lamb: Ally seemed to really enjoy it. 4) Escargot : these little buggers were served under a giant pile of melted mozarella - what's not to love?  The wine list is pretty good as well. However, their glass only selection is quite limited. Not wanting to drop $80 on a bottle of wine for the three of us, our choice of a glass of wine was pretty much already made.   Overall, I'm giving this place 3.5 stars, but rounding up because the atmosphere was so cute and the service was pretty fast too!"}
{"text":"The second visit made ALL the difference. Great, if not amazing, service, and a super happy table of stuffed people. In other words: win! More dinners will be had."}
{"text":"There are many choices in Old Montreal but this restaurant is truly a gem.  The menu provides a wide selection for anyone's palate from light fare (salads), casual (poutine), to formal (steaks, chops & seafood).  It was perfect for my wife and I.  She wanted a salad and a burger and I was craving something more formal a Porterhouse Steak, which was cooked perfectly.  The decor is quite beautiful, giving you the essence of Old Montreal with an updated modern flare.  The wait staff was gracious and fluent in several languages.  The full service bar was excellent with a complete array of house specialties and a comprehensive wine list by the bottle or glass.    Finally the price was quite reasonable adding up to a wonderful experience.  This restaurant is a must visit if you are in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm only going to be rating based on the Sunday buffet brunch. I had been here over 10 years ago but never had a reason to return. My guy suggested that we go one weekend because he had been before. I remembered the last meal I had there very vaguely but I was pleasantly surprised. I first made a stop at the omelet station and chose the ingredients that the chef expertly turned into a mouthwatering dish. He flipped the omelet with finesse - a skill I'm still trying to develop. I also grabbed a piece of Belgian waffle which I topped with mini chocolate chips, strawberries, and maple syrup. I also had to get some bacon, a pile of smoked salmon (with a lemon wedge), and a some grilled vegetable salad. I also shared a creme brulee and rice pudding for dessert. The crunchy brulee top was lovely and I was very happy with it. The coffee was the biggest disappointment...it tasted like it was very inexpensive.  Overall, if you're a big eater then you can more than get your money's worth and kids under 12 are half priced."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when reading a fact in my guidebook to Montreal that this restaurant featured three levels and could literally seat hundreds of people.  Would this prove to be a land-based cruise ship of bland, ordinary food served en masse? Would people be lining up for slop?   Fortunately my exaggerated concerns did not come to fruition. On the contrary, we were seated right by the window with a stunning view of the beauty that is Vieux Montreal. Quite a few happy strollers licking their ice cream cones marked our meal.  Upon entering this restaurant , you'll observe fairly dim lighting in a bar area with a flight of stairs leading to the other levels. Yes, there are levels but that's no reason to worry. The overall space is large but each room feels comfortable, cozy and exists in its own self-contained world of carnivore treats.  The Table d'hote is a French phrase you should commit to memory. It's a meal with several courses where some of the key components change on a daily basis. Sort of like prix-fixe but with an element of surprise.  My $30 dinner consisted of a mesclun salad with a honey dijon dressing, lamb chops and a slice of chocolate mousse cake. (Although technically the menu said \"lamb shops\". What does a lamb shop for? I won't complete the punch line. )  Now the salad was a mere footnote to the delicious lamb chops. Three juicy chops with enough meat on them to satisfy my cravings. Obviously, this is a steakhouse so you could just as easily order Angus pride AAA Canadian beef cuts like t-bone, tenderloin, striploin and bavette steak.  Besides the flavor of the lamb chops what sticks in mind most clearly  was the exceptional service. Our waiter had no trouble showing us several lobsters so my wife could identify the perfect specimen. It was like Goldie Locks and the three lobsters-- 2 and 1/4 pounds was just right!  The chocolate mousse cake was an enjoyable way to end the meal.  There's a traditional cocktail menu as well, mainly of classics without that much experimentation. Think black russians , margaritas and manhattans. The wine list is geographically dispersed with choices from Canada, France, the US, South Africa, Italy and more.  If you are staying in Vieux Montreal or just passing through for the day, a stop by the Restaurant du Vieux Montreal is tres bon."}
{"text":"I can't put 3 1/2 on the rating but otherwise I would. We went there on happening restaurant week and got the menu at 23$. The salmon tartar was not tasty at all, barely with any seasoning at all, the flat iron  steak was good though, with a nice little catch of \"would you like any sauce with the steak\" that they charge extra of course, with no warning. The dessert was a crème brûlée that was nothing but extraordinary. And oh yes, the wine, well you spent a good amount on wine that's for sure. 17$ the 9 oz glass of Malbec, ouch.   In one word: you pay the price for the set up and the atmosphere of the place which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"We came to this steak house on our trip to Montreal! I wanted to go back the second time during our trip but we never found the time. That's how much we loved it!! Service great! Good excellent!! Atmosphere got Gorgeous!!"}
{"text":"I only went here for desserts. The flaming crème brûlée was fun though had too much liquid in it after all the flames are out.   The chocolate cake was quite nice and rich.   Service was great but we were there at the end of the night with few patrons."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is huge! We came in for supper, and were seated on the second level. The waiter was a no-nonsense fellow who barely said three words to us, but I guess we weren't there to make friends.   Though the service was curt, it was quick. Not that we were necessarily looking to get out of there in a hurry, but we were kind of hungry, so it didn't hurt.  My husband had the top sirloin baseball cut with mashed potatoes. He said the steak wasn't anything special, and the potatoes were quite bland. This was surprising, considering the price.  I had the shrimp with wild rice and spinach. It came with a little pot of melted butter, so my life was grand. There was nothing on my plate that I didn't dip in melted butter. This has led me to a new inspirational lifestyle in which I will now only eat foods that have been wholly submerged in delicious slated butter.  Anyway, the whole experience cost more than it was worth, so three stars it is!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times for Christmas parties with friends and coworkers. Today I decided to head over to this resto for a quick lunch with a friend. I had the salmon with garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was juicy and well seasoned. I then enjoyed the most delicious chocolate mousse cake. I was very happy with my meal and with the price for the lunch menu. The service was good and our waiter was very attentive. On a sidenote, this place has the best Sunday brunch layout. The options are endless. You have an omelette station, waffles, potatos, fruits, pancakes etc... It is buffet style so you can keep going back and filling up your plates. Overall, a great restaurant in the heart of the Old Port."}
{"text":"This resto located in the old port of Montreal offers an all you can eat Sunday brunch for 32$ and recently went to check it out with a group of friends. The resto itself is housed in an old lovely building and has great decor on all 3 floors. It also has a grest outdoor terrace. Sunday brunch is good for family get together or day out with friends.Good for groups. Service was friendly.The brunch offers 5 stations..breakfast, salads, meat, fish , pasta and desserts. As with all buffets...the trick is small portions so you can try a bit of everything. The food in general was pretty good. Enjoyed the omelette station as well as the fish, roast beef and grilled eggplant salad."}
{"text":"I remember this restaurant from many years ago when I walked in, but couldn't say if the experience was good or not. The ambiance was very relaxed with the decor quite modern. I ordered the warm goat cheese spinach which is  called The Red peoper tower which was wonderful to the pallet. My main meal was going to be a steak but they had a variety. I was attracted to the Fillet Minion medallions but it came to me being very tough and under cooked. The waiter suggested I order another cut which was tender but uncooked. It was raw in the middle so it was returned once again. They had difficulties serving me my steak Medium. In the end I was disappointed and will never return since I am a Montrealer. It wasn't my night or the cooks..... lol"}
{"text":"Updated review: is a 2 start review  The Breakfast buffet at this place is aweful, your paying 40$ a person to eat just plain bufet food. This is the old port there are 20+ places within 5 minutes walking that are 10times better. I heard people say this place was good for the breakfst buffet, but i have no idea what they are talkig about. Typical omlets, bagels, fruit, and decent roast beef....its whatever I would not recomned this place, especially for the price.  Previous: was a 4 star review I would typically write of large restoraunts such this, however I was pleasantly surprised by their ability to deliver! Had the crab cake with a stake for 26$, was well worth it! Was very impressed by the ability to serve 20+ stakes cooked to perfection simultaneously, a sign of an pro kitchen. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Everything I ordered wasn't hot enough and this to multiple people on outer table of 12. Nice place tho and the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"The miso black cod and top sirloin steak baseball cut was really good, I was happy with my orders. Only thing that I didn't like was that there was a really loud baby, but the restaurant can't control that. Additionally, the creme brulee was a really big serving and it was also really good. If you order well, sometimes the average yelp rating doesn't matter! I am very happy with my decision to come here."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Located in the \"old\" portion of Montreal, the atmosphere in the street leads to drawing people out to visit locations in the area. They were accommodating for a large group of 10. The food and cocktails were fantastic.  Within our group of 10, 9 of us got steaks, and loved them.  One of the steaks came out a little overcooked compared to how it was ordered.  We had an 8:30 reservation, but still ended up waiting for 30 minutes before our table was ready.  As compensation for our extended wait time, everyone in our group received a free cocktail.    Once seated, the service was good, but slower than what we would expect.  The atmosphere within the space was very relaxing, the music wasn't too loud so we could still hold a conversation at normal speaking volume."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance inside. The service was alright but the food could have been better. My steak had sharp pieces of bone in it of which if I wasn't very careful I could have eaten and possibly cut my mouth up. The steak was a good size but not worth all the fat and sharp bone pieces in it. I don't think I'll be coming back here that's for sure. The waiter was a bit on the ride side when it came time for the check."}
{"text":"Excellent service is the best thing I can say about this place.  The steaks were far from top quality and were not cooked as ordered.  Don't waste your time as The Keg is right down the street and far superior."}
{"text":"Their customer service is by far the worst! They're in a prime location therefore receive plenty business so they don't care to lose their regulars!"}
{"text":"Was there over the weekend for a bachelorette party.  I think that bottom line, if you go to a steak house, stick to the steak when you order! Everyone (we were 9) that ordered steak said it was really good, eventhough one had to send it back because it was not cooked to her order.   I had the crabcake as an appetizer and Boy Oh Boy... call me spoiled because I have had Maryland crabcakes, but that was NOT worth the 11$ they charged me for. Would have not have been worth 5$ either.   I ordered the Burger VP, and that was not good either. The patty felt like Harvey's, and Harvey,s is not my favorite burger place by far.  Service was good though, very professional and attentive.   Oh, and their Rosé sangria was truly good."}
{"text":"Great all around dining experience. Pleasant relaxed atmosphere, excellent friendly service and good food with ample portions.If you are looking for a restaurant to deliver a reliable good quality experience you wont go wrong here."}
{"text":"So good. Staff was friendly with our kids. Service was great. Kids enjoyed appetizers as meals as we didn't see a kids menu (but didn't ask either). Entrées were perfectly portioned. Desserts were great too. Overall a good vibe and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very good food strongly suggest you try it for yourself. Being in the old port sitting by the window is an experience all on its own the wait staff is very polite and are very courteous! I had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Nice outside area outback. The Service was good spoke good English. I had the Porterhouse very good cooked perfect. Did not like the side of veggie though just seemed like they out of a freezer bag. Would go back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to grab dinner on our first night in Old Montreal.  There are many great places throughout the city, but you can't always go to your favorite places.  This was a good change of pace for us.  The service was fine, nothing exceptional but still very attentive.    The atmosphere was my boyfriends favorite part.  Elegant yet sophisticated with a hint of high class but enough to feel comfortable.  The food was good, nothing special but still a very solid meal.  Great location. I would come back but it wouldn't be my first choice.  I would recommend it, but not before some of my other favorite spots."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse for us! The best filet mignon I've ever had! Very relaxing and cozy on the second floor in front of the fireplace or our favourite spot beside the window overlooking the street. So nice!!"}
{"text":"First I will start by saying, it is a beautiful place in the Old Montreal area.  I had a reservation and the friendly hostess sat me right away.   Then it took about seven or eight minutes for someone to bring me some water and about another five minutes to come take my order.   My server was nice, and I don't blame her.  I think she had too many tables and not enough help.  A few minutes later, some bread and butter was delivered.  It was nothing very special, just your average bread.  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken, which had some sort of lemon sauce, Feta cheese, and served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  I got it without the Feta.  It was sort of underwhelming.  The sauce was good, but the chicken was rather tough and dry.   The potatoes and veggies were good, but overall an average meal.  I will come back and I will try a steak next time I'm here.  They looked good.   So did several other dishes, I just had a big lunch, and I didn't want anything big or heavy, that's why I got the chicken."}
{"text":"This restaurant was overall disappointing. I was with a group of my girlfriends visiting Montréal and we went to dinner here. My friends and I sat down and the waiters came over to us about ten minutes after. He was cold and not very polite. When we asked what came with the meals, he rolled his eyes and proceeded to tell us unwillingly. My two girl friends who are vegetarians ordered the pasta with vegetables and another friend and I ordered the steak. We ordered them medium, just so they were pink in the middle and not too chewy. While we were waiting, we were served warm rolls, honestly the best part of the meal. Our food came shortly after. The pasta that my friends ordered was cold and tasted like it was microwaved with store-bought sauce. The steak was so chewy and over done. It honestly could have been microwaved. The salad and french fries that came with the meal were fine. For dessert we had a chocolate and vanilla mouse cake, and overall it was good but seemed like it was not made in the kitchen. I will not return back here in my future trips to Montréal and I don't believe you should spend your time and money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was an incredible, this place serves very good steaks, the price is according to the quality of the meat. The atmosphere is nice and it goes with the type of food. But the best thing of the dinner was the service is the waiter Monosh Kanti, probably the best one that I had. He provide a good guidance and an excellent attitude at every moment."}
{"text":"Had the escargot and rib eye steak. The escargot was okay, but it didn't seem like too much effort was put into it. The real disappointment was in the steak. It was a bit too overcooked and the outside was really burnt. I don't know about you, but I would rather prefer my steak without a black crust that leaks into every bite and ruins the flavour of the meat. They had a 3 beer selection."}
{"text":"not worth the money, I gave 2 stars only for the environment and few service. we had our easter sunday brunch at vieux-port steakhouse, it was terrible. too many people for so little food. And to tell the truth, we had tried better brunch with that price, even the pavillon 67 casino's brunch is cheaper and better food quality than the vieux -port steakhouse. I wouldn't recommend people going there for brunch. There isn't much to eat neither."}
{"text":"Idéal pour un passage rapide vers Montréal. Le restaurant est énorme, avec une ambiance tamisée et assez sombre. Avec le temps superbe qu'il faisait, on s'est dirigé directement sur la terrasse ensoleillée. La terrasse est très grande, vraiment sympa et on n'est pas collés les uns aux autres.   Le service est sympathique, attentif. On a pu faire remplacer l'accompagnement de la pièce de boeuf de ma soeur qui ne correspondait pas à ce qui était écrit sur le menu. J'ai pris un burger, rien d'exceptionnel mais des produits de bonne qualité et les frites étaient super bonnes. Un menu intéressant pour le midi 21$ avec entrée, plat, dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some mid afternoon appetizers. Got poutine with roast beef and a foie gras dish, very yummy!! Main problem was that they only had draft beer, which I normally prefer anyways, but then they only had like 3 to pick from. Being a steakhouse we figured they would have a lot to pick from, especially local, but no."}
{"text":"The prettiest terrace in Old Montreal. Beautifully maintained greenery. Delicious fresh meal. Try the Mint Condition cocktail - superb, refreshing Summer drink!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak avec bonne cuisson. Accompagnements ordinaires, mais service de qualité. Décor remarquable."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  My wife and I shared a seafood platter.  Went perfectly with our white wine.  Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"RAW CHICKEN WHAT?????    My chicken was bloody. I'm not into salmonella. thx bye."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here.  This place is a bit of a puzzle to me.  It kind of screams lite classy atmosphere yet hosts a steak and hockey thing for Canadiens games.  Odd but I like it.  I had a bit of surf and turf here.  Went with the NY Strip and scallops.  The steak was cooked to perfection, as were the scallops.  There was also a garlic mash as well which went terrific with the meat.  The waiter was awesome, and attentive.  All in all a great lunch, but I'd love to go for a game."}
{"text":"This place was jammed packed on Christmas Eve. The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed but the manager quickly stepped in to get everyone seated quickly. It's a three level restaurant, with lots of space and tables, great for family gatherings or large parties. Although big, it had a great ambience, cozy and homey. We ordered their Christmas fixed price menu for $52 (Escargot/ Lobster linguine / creme brûlée) as well as top sirloin steak. Everything tasted great, but what stood out was our servers exceptional service. Anytime any of our food was delayed he would offer us complimentary wine or drinks. Overall great spot."}
{"text":"Worst steak I ever had.  Went there for brunch with 3 other adults.  The place was empty.  Ordered NY Strip with half lobster.  They messed the order at the kitchen and they asked if we would take crab legs instead, which I declined as I wanted lobster.  Food took forever.   I ordered my steak medium rare, and the others asked for medium.  All the steaks came way over well-done, and almost impossible to eat, same with the lobster (hard, dry and tasteless).  We didn't return the food because we waited so long and were in a rush to leave. Waiter was extremely annoying, made stupid jokes and remarks, and didn't bother to serve us (had to ask for steak sauce 4 times before he brought it).   Hugely disappointed as it was the first restaurant we visited in Montreal.  Would rate them negative stars if I could"}
{"text":"My friend and I went on Friday night, the place was busy, but not like crazy busy.   We don't have reservation, but we ave no problem getting us a table  Server came after we be seated  Brought us some water.   Waiter disappeared for good 15 minutes, finally he came back, because he was gone for so long, we wanted to ordered everything, god knows when he will be back, after another 5 minutes, he brought us some bread, it was okay, nothing special  I ordered the ribeye steak, it was just a..ok, not sure why some of the rating is so high here, I been to many steak house all over the world, and this here, blah  But the main problem here is the service   During our dinner, our waiter never stop by once and check up on us, and after awhile, I told him I need more water, he said okay  After another 15 minutes, still my glass is empty, and I saw him opening a wine bottle standing next table, and he saw me, I raised my glass to him, he saw me and pretend he didn't see me, after another 10 minutes, our dinner is finished, he brought me my water, total of 25 minutes of glass of water   After dinner, he came and handed us the dessert menu, but we not really in the mood anymore waited so damn long, and he came back, we asked for the check, he brought it to us, and guess what? He disappeared AGAIN! lol  Now sitting here talking about it, is kinda funny.   So we waited, and we waited...this time he never come back. lol  I was upset, so we got up, and about put on our jacket and about to leave, so we finally paid up front, I never seen such terrible service before   Never again"}
{"text":"Première visite a ce restaurant pour le brunch. Très beau restaurant avec du mobilier chic comme ont peut s'attendre dans un steak house. Bon choix de mets pour le déjeuner. Pour le froid il y a suffisamment de saumon fume, diverses salades, fromages etc. Bon choix de plats chauds, pâtes ,poulet, poisson et le rôti de buf était délicieux. En gros, bonne nourriture correct pour un buffet. Le seul bémol est le fait que les cuisiniers affectés au buffet chaud n'avaient pas du tout envie d'être la a travailler et ne le cachaient même pas. Notre serveuse elle était excellente. Elle nous a même fait des suggestions pour les desserts au buffet. Bravo a elle."}
{"text":"So I was in Montreal visiting the In laws...  I thought it would be nice to take them to a nice dinner...  I researched many Steakhouses The one with the best reveiws was Queue de Cheval but got poopooed cause it was too costly so we ended up at Du Vieux Port....  no parking so we had to find a place on the street... thenwalk in below zero temps to get to the restuarant... (-1star I hate the cold and having to manage not slipping on patchs of ice did not put me in the best of moods)  as soon as we walked in we were greeted but a blast of warm air =) and french =(  we had reservations and were promted seated at a lovely window sit... the room felt like you were dinning in a fancy dining room in someone's house... very warm and cozy...and yet upscale and romantic ...  the room kinda raises your expectations of the food =(  In a party of 6, 5 of us got steaks... mine was the pepper steak... but it didn't taste different then my husbands bone in rib eye  or my mother in laws prime rib or my father in laws New york steak =/  all the steaks came with a 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes and  grilled tomato, onions,  summer squash. They were all very tender but the fact they all tasted the same was disappointing to me =(   Brother in law had the Santa fe chicken or something like that it looked good but i didn't try it.  for a party of 6  the tab came to $275 US  w/ wine and tip.  for almost $50 person it was no Ruth Chris'"}
{"text":"This place is right smack of the tourist traps. However, it's actually quite good. They offer a three course meal ( aperitif, entree and dessert) for ~$16 Canadian. You can also several different dishes a la carte, but this special lung menu was quite affordable. If you are to come here, ask for Steve to serve you... We affectionally referred to him as super steve! He is quite certainly one of the friendliest and professional waiters we've encountered in our trip."}
{"text":"Típica steak house como em qualquer outro lugar . Boa para Grupos grandes , ótimo pátio .  Bom para crianças ."}
{"text":"Meals at our table were the New York strip, black cod and grilled salmon. Everyone was extremely happy with the food. Our waiter, Angelo, was very helpful and knew exactly the right time to play with our crowd. A very memorable night in the end."}
{"text":"We were wandering through the Old City (which seems to be hit-or-miss when it comes to dining options) and stumbled onto this very good steakhouse. The food was delicious and the service was truly great. The back patio is charming. We didn't love the cheesecake for dessert, but by then we were stuffed and satisfied anyway!"}
{"text":"Great location, excellent service, wonderful Sunday Brunch options"}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday lunch.  Since I don't care for Tomatoes, I asked if I could substitute French onion for the tomato soup.  Wow...what a hard time I got.  I even offered to pay the $3 difference in price. I was told \"sorry, the computer won't let us do that.\"  The matter had to be escalated to the manager and they agreed.  But what a negative initial impression.  On to the food.  Onion soup: Excellent!  One of the best I've had.  Nice temperature, flavorful broth, perfectly rendered onions with tons of gooey cheese melted on top. Foie Gras:  So So...it's not what we were expecting which was seared.  Instead, it as more of a cold pâté, similar to what we get in a tin from the specialty store.  But the marmalade and little maple drops were good.  However (back to bad impressions), when I asked for some extra bread (which comes with the dish), the waiter brought some crostini, stating something about not being able to bring the other bread.  I said \"really?\"  He could see my frustration and went to get the appropriate bread.  $18 way overpriced Mac and Cheese was solid, as was the way way overpriced $19 burger which they only served medium well or well, which means the burger was dry.  Needless to say, we probably won't be returning to this place, ESPECIALLY at the high price, mediocre food and weak service (although our waiter was a champ)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I chose this place for dinner on our trip to Montreal.  The service was extremely professional, our server Yavor was no doubt the best sever we encountered our entire trip.  The food matched the service and everything was delicious.  We had the calamari appetizer, Caesar salad, bone in ribeye and halibut, paired with a great bottle of wine at a great window seat in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait just because they're in a tourist area . Probably get a better steak at the keg next door better service for sure"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for both the LUNCH TABLE D'HÔTE which is very reasonably priced and served up promptly and during the Happening Gourmand 2017 & 2018.  Perfect for a business lunch!  It comes with coffee/tea, entree, main and dessert (for $3 extra) all that for an average of $20! Go for it! 4/5  Talking about my most recent 2018 HG experience, I had tasted the filet mignon bacon-wrapped medallions and they were really good.  Tender and juicy!  This is the more pricey HG choice.  My friends and I opted for the herbs and green apple salmon tartare on the HG menu and we were all disappointed.  We had expected a crisp, fresh and slightly tart green apple flavor in the tartar but it ended up being quite tasteless and the bread crisps they served tasted stale.  The waiter seemed unenthusiastic about the food and serving in general.  AND he had poor waiting manners as he reached over other people at the table with his arm to serve instead of going beside the person being served, which was totally possible as we were sitting at a round table! He was also a bit grumpy.  Despite that, service was ok.  The restaurant was very quiet on a Thursday night maybe due to the weather.  My friend said the salmon was very steakhouse like, whatever that meant :) and was pretty decent.  I ordered the Beef Striploin NYCut and I was satisfied with the medium-well steak.  It wasn't the best steak I've ever had but definitely not the worst so middle road.   Dessert was Crème brûlée but was not served in ramekins as you'd expect but served in little dessert bowls--kinda weird.  Taste was ok.  So in conclusion, if I had to rate the lunchtime table d'hote, I wouldn't mind giving it a 4/5 but this time, the HG was just so-so for me which means 3/5 overall."}
{"text":"Since the Keg had an hour wait and I was with 2 grown men who were hungry, we came to Vieux-Port instead. Our waiter was too proud to be serving us, I really don't know how to say it, he never looked us while taking our order and was annoyed that we were even there! My salmon was well cooked, but extremely blend, my fiance's steak was apparently perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The service was a bit disappointing.  The server seemed rushed and inattentive.  I had red snapper which was the fish of the day and Joel had chicken and shrimp.  The restaurant was beautiful and had a wood burning fireplace."}
{"text":"On Sundays, they brunch! For $30 (canadian), there is a wide assortments of yummyness to choose from.   My brother and I decided to spend our new years day starting here. So much to choose from, hot breakfast items, omelettes made to order, prime rib, roast lamb, and so much more.   There is a lot of seating but Reservations are recommended, even the snow won't stop people from this delicious brunch spot."}
{"text":"We've dined at this old city restaurant many times and I sill consider their rack of lamb one of the best in Montreal. This weekend however we decided to try their Sunday Brunch and  was very satisfied at the wide range of options available,everything from the standard omelet  and roast beef carving stations,freshly baked breads and pastries,shrimp and smoked salmon,country pate to BBQ chicken,mussels,stuffed rigatoni,Dover sole and goat cheese raviolis.  All in all an excellent value for $24.99 Canadian per person. served only on Sundays from 10am to 3 pm. My one complaint however is my wife's mimosa and my bloody mary was devoid of any alcohol what so ever so at $7.00 a drink we had very dear orange and tomato juices."}
{"text":"We came here as part of a tour group.  The atmosphere and décor was gorgeous.  The service was very friendly and accommodating.  The food was outstanding!  I was very pleased with how they handled the large group and they were able to get all the food out and in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal !!! The brunch has to be one of the best I've ever experienced. Over 28 different items from bacon and eggs to prime rib and potatoes. The service was excellent and the food was even better . Also a must have item are the beef ribs . They actually cut the ribs of of the rib roast and serve them as well . If you're ever in Montreal you HAVE to check this place out , you can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"Explored old town Montreal this afternoon and decided to stay around the area and search for dinner. We were in search for escargot and found this restaurant to have the most variety in menu options. Street parking only. The restaurant is quite large and has a second floor. Restrooms are clean and are situated upstairs. Staff is friendly and service was definitely fast.   For our appetizers, we ordered:  Green salad - mixed baby greens w shredded carrots and a lovely Dijon balsamic dressing. Light, refreshing and perfectly dressed.  Roast beef poutine - DELICIOUS! The roast beef was succulent, the gravy perfectly seasoned, the fries were crispy, & the melty cheese was just right...it was all prepared well and the flavors were spot on. We've never had poutine this good before. Bravo Canada!  French onion soup - my hubby's favorite soup of all time. The flavors were great and the broth was perfectly seasoned.   Escargot au gratin - I've never had escargot w cheese before. It tasted like a yummy pizza topping, garlicky and tender.   For our entrees, we ordered:  12 oz rib steak - this was part of their table d'hote menu where you choose an appetizer and entree for $23 and must order before 6pm. The steak was served w mashed potatoes and haricot vert + bell peppers. I must say this steak is in the top 3 of the best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and the perfect amount of grill flavor. I ordered it medium and it came out a little bit more red than medium, but that's okay because I devoured that bad boy! Succulent melt in your mouth Canadian beefy goodness. Sides were good, too. YUM!  Lobster linguine - my hubby is a sucker for anything lobster + pasta. This dish was flavorful, but needed more lobster meat. This $25 pasta dish will only get you claw and knuckle meat. Hubby wasn't too happy about that.   Overall, the dinner was delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary. We would definitely return though bc the execution of the dishes were spot on and the flavors were great. The food came out fast and hot."}
{"text":"Help! Help!   This place seemed like a good choice to get a good Bloody Mary, but whoa nelly, was my group of friends and I wrong.   It seems, alcohol despite being advertised as a part of this classic cocktail, was only available upon request.  Definitely not a good place to have an overprice cocktail.  UPDATE: After being forced to order food, we settled on a dozen oysters. Half the oysters appeared to be missing, or so tiny they were non-existent.  tl;dr: AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Good flavorful steak with bacon butter. The salad was fresh and tasty Dijon dressing. The strawberry cheesecake was also good. They were busy on a Thursday evening so service was slow, but they tried! I would recommend if you want a good steakhouse steak, nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend and was delighted. The menu was nicely varied with some unusual choices. I had the ribeye with a side of half a grilled lobster. Loved the house Cabernet. Jimmy, our waiter, did a phenomenal job with a handful of complicating factors and was kind and polite through it all. Great place! We sat upstairs and the place was humming but not frantic. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant to bring visitors to the Old Port of Montreal for work dinner. The ambiance is great, stone walls, beautiful ceilings and operating fire place on each floor. If the municipality of Montreal could fix the side street our guests would be even more impressed, but of course that has nothing to do with the food quality.  The restaurant is advertising itself as a steak house and they are proud of their Canadian beef, as such they really know how to make a good steak. Very happy with my centre cut fillet mignon, prepared exactly medium rare as requested, very slightly burned from outside as I like it. Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine. The poutine was a little bit disappointing, fries were kind of cold and the roast beef presence was minimal. I guess we shocked the chef with that order.   The service is great. I started the night with classic dry martini, so good. The cocktail list needs to be explored by me again. With that said I would come some other time for a personal dinner and when in need of a good steak."}
{"text":"The steak and fries were amazing and so well done. The wait staff was incredible even when we had food allergies and I really enjoyed the environment:)"}
{"text":"I happened to go here during the \"Happening Gourmand\"  The baseball cut sirloin was delicious. I could have used more garlic flavour in my mashed potatoes but I am a minority voice of garlic flavour lovers.  I was disappointed by the chocolate mousse cake duo. The cake was dry and ruined what was an excellent main course experience.  Pro Tip - The cocktail of the month \"Le Janvier\" is amazing - Vodka, Lillet and lemon juice (possible sugar too) melds a fresh citrusy punch"}
{"text":"After a day of marketing meetings and cocktail hour, some of us went out for supper at the Vieux-Port Steakhouse in Old Montreal last night.  It's a cute spot in an old building.   There were 14 of us and we had no reservation ... we just showed up on someone's recommendation.  They were able to seat us over three tables.   I ordered the Rib Steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  It was tender and tasty ... I had ordered it medium-well and it was more medium-rare, though.   It is a nice restaurant ... a place to go for a special occasion. Tom took good care of us."}
{"text":"31 dec 2015 repas parfait .Bons classiques;escargots saumon fumé et le plus que parfait filet mignom j'en avais vraiment  le goût.  Le super service de Jimmy je crois etait top niveau. Cheers to 2016"}
{"text":"Visited Vieux-Port Steakhouse for Easter Brunch. The food was meh. We waited an extra 20 minutes even with reservations. The front of house was very disorganized. The hostess wasn't friendly and waiting area was packed. We were led to our table but had to stand there while they changed the tablecloths and plates and silverware.  Maybe service and food (buffet) suffered because of the holiday crowd but I won't return."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Steaks are always great, not overpriced and a great selection of wines. The service is always fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Not the best steakhouse I have ever been to, but was a great stop when looking for a steak.  I visited on my last trip to Montreal for Formula 1 and it did not disappoint. The meats were great and the seafood dishes were very fresh.  Everyone (group of 17) I was with enjoyed their respective dishes and the outdoor setting area.  We made a reservation and were able to sit all together at 1 table.  I ordered the Rib Steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  It was very tender and tasty ... I had ordered it medium-rare, as all steaks should be.  I split the crab cake and Seafood platter with two other people and enjoyed all of the dishes."}
{"text":"We choose this restaurant after our first choice next store had too long a wait.  We ended up being happy for the \"2nd\" choice.  The restaurant is beautiful -- lots of levels but cozy feel.  Waiter was very attentive.  My kids ordered steak and the striped bass.  I ordered the baseball cut steak as well but with the peppercorn sauce.  The peppercorn sauce was incredible -- among finest I have had.  Only thing that was disappointing was escargot -- too much cheese.  The kids loved their meals as well.  Although quite fancy, my causal kids felt at ease on second level and we had to-die-for view of street."}
{"text":"My aunt and I were tourists exploring Old Town who happened to get hungry and look for places to eat. Luckily, VPS had a menu out front that had a more affordable lunch menu, so we already knew what we wanted when we walked in.   The place was fairly empty expect for a couple parties and although quite dark inside, extremely elegant, with an Old World, mahogany wood style as we were immediately seated.   Our waiter, who is bilingual, was very helpful and attentive. We ordered the hamburger steak for her and the Chicken Brochette for myself. Although we both ordered salads for starters, she got the cauliflower soup instead and decided to eat it (she's very polite)! To her surprise, she enjoyed it greatly!   The house dinner rolls were warm and plump and lovely. My heart wanted more but my head told me no! Haha!   As my aunt told me stories about traveling the Mediterranean, she thoroughly enjoyed her hamburger steak and veggie sides as I enjoyed my chicken brochette which came with rice pilaf that was soft and delicious and cooked spinach. The citrus salad on the brochette gave it a sweet edge that I haven't had in California and enjoyed it immensely.   We also have to point out that at 12 noon, the bathrooms were impeccably clean and had a lovely scent. I felt completely at home there.   We'll return should we be back. Merci!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took the kids to this old school Montreal steakhouse for New Years Eve. We loved the neighborhood and the atmosphere, and were seated at a great table by a window on the second floor. My husband enjoyed the French onion soup appetizer then we both got steak, I liked my filet and I also ordered a blue cheese sauce. All in all it was a decent meal but I wasn't blown away by the food. Good overall experience and service."}
{"text":"Lovely little steakhouse in Vieux Port! We got a table by the  (real wood burning) fire and were treated to outstanding service.  The food was great, though perhaps not 5 stars-blow-your-mind oustanding. I had the salmon, husband had the baseball steak. We also had the salmon tartare appetizer which was great! This place is a solid choice for a lovely dining experience that is very affordable. If you go for \"early dinner\" before 6pm (which for us was actually late lunch at 4:45), you get an appetizer and main course for $23. Seriously. With the conversion rate, that's only around $16 US for a steak, potatoes, and salad. So go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there during the MTLatable event.They offer a special menu during that time.  We had appetizers, iron flat steak, lamb ribs and two desserts. The steak was OK according to my husband. My lamb ribs was good with perfect cooking time. The flavor of meat is not so distinct. No wow- factor.  The salmon tartar for appetizer was very bland. There was a genuine fire place. The deco was very nice. The building was a warehouse a hundred year ago. Overall a very average steakhouse."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant gets five stars for their steak.  It was tough to chew.  They also charged $18 for mac and cheese and $15 for tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  It must be a tourist trap as I wouldn't go back and pay that price again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My husband and I were looking for a good and meal and this place left us satisfied. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good steak."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but on the iPad Yelp app this restaurant has a *much* lower rating.  Basically, they all say the same thing : awful service.  The steak we had was fine.  But we waited over 30 minutes for each course, and eventually skipped the dessert which was included in our set, because we didn't want to spend the whole night there.  A table of four people was seated beside us, only to leave after 30 minutes of no service whatsoever.  Even when we tried to get out, we had to ask twice for the bill.  At one point in the evening, we did not see our waiter for an hour.  A shame, because the restaurant itself is quite nice, and the food was ok."}
{"text":"La première fois que je suis allée à ce restaurant c'était pour un brunch pour la fête des mères. J'ai vraiment apprécié l'endroit. Ils nous ont proposé un imposant buffet avec une multitude de choix de viennoiseries, des fruits, des salades, des choix de viandes, des plats préparés (ex: cannelloni, purée de pomme de terre, riz, oeufs). Tout était savoureux, le service courtois et efficace. Puis je suis revenue au cours de l'été et nous avons pu profiter de la terrasse à l'arrière. Au calme, dans une ruelle pas trop passante, j'ai pris les pâtes au homard. J'ai vraiment été satisfaite de mon plat, il y avait de nombreux morceaux de homard, la sauce était crémeuse et bien assaisonnée. Ma mère a pris du saumon et mon père la bavette. Tous les deux ont été ravis de leur plat. Je suis revenu cette année pour le brunch de la nouvelle année. Quelque peu déçue par la section viennoiseries, les choix étaient nettement plus limités, beaucoup trop de desserts à mon avis, ce qui est trop sucré et riche pour le matin. Pas autant de croissant/chocolatine/brioches/baguette de pain.... :( Aussi service nettement moins efficace, nous devions constamment faire un signe afin de se faire servir du café. Aucun esprit de vente de la part des serveurs, un mimosa avec ça ?!? Moi en tout cas j'en voulait un et j'ai donc du trouver un serveur pour le commander :D"}
{"text":"Don't even bother. This place looks nice from outside and it's actually welcoming too. The staff are very nice, cozy atmosphere and table appointments are clean and neat. The service is what's getting a star. Our server Alan was very nice. So, I ordered a Manhattan (drink). And It was was terrible. I believe that it should be quite obvious that (at least for a restaurant in the middle of old Montréal, which is a prominent tourist attraction), cocktails made with clear liquids should be stirred and not shaken. However, when I mentioned that my drink was shaken to the manager, he proudly announced that they always shake their Manhattan. It's actually a shame. They should know better. Now the steak. When you come into a steakhouse and order a ribeye, you naturally juice up your mouth believing that soon you will be enjoying the juicy medium rare steak seasoned to perfection and to your taste. That's not the case. Believe me. I guarantee you that you will have to chew your steak at least 2 minutes before you can actually swallow it . It's rough. It's dry(medium rare) and it's actually tasteless. I have never had a steak that bad. I actually wonder where they get their steaks. I took a picture of it believing that it will be tasty, because it looks delicious. Anyways, I think I've too much time describing all this. Save your money and time. Go somewhere worthy and this place isn't."}
{"text":"We had supper on the terrace on a Tuesday evening.  The terrace is lovely and the weather was beautiful!  Our waiter was helpful and attentive.  We had the seafood platter for two, which is supposed to be an appetizer, for our meal.  Once you have salad first and add a couple of vegetables, it does make a good meal.  The food was excellent.  Some lovely chardonnay complemented the meal.    We shared Creme brulee for dessert, with some cappuccino.  Our only complaint was that the \"decaf\" cappuccino might not have actually been decaffeinated.    It was a wonderful evening and we'll be back again on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"A very nice and cozy environment. My boyfriend and I attended the New Years Eve celebration the Steakhouse hosted and it exceeded our expectations. The staff are all friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm trying hard to think when I've had a worse meal and I'm just not coming up with anything. Went there Friday night as we go once or twice a summer and enjoy dining on their terrasse. I was in the mood for steak frites however they only offer that on their lunch menu. I asked the waiter if they would substitute the mashed potatos and veggies for french fries on my $38.00? He immediately said no! Odd so I order a $19.00 VP Hamburger which came with french fries. So obviously they were still making fries for their dinner menu. NOW why in the world would you not take an order for a $38 steak and instead turn it into an order for a $19 hamburger.??? Doesn't make sense, am I right.....LOL ! Their loss I thought. My partner ordered the steak. We waited some time for our appetizer which never came. We flagged down our waiter who said he didn't hear us order the calamari. Said he would bring it with our meal if that was o.k. Well skip the calamari as it's huge thick  chewy rubber bands cooked in batter. Hardly digestible. The meat in our dinner was the same. My partners steak was over cooked, not reasonable for a diner let along some place that touts themselves as a \"steakhouse\". The hamburger was worse, overcooked and dry as a bone. Could have gone to 5 Guys and had a juicy hamburger for $5.00. The bun the hamburger was on was old and dried up the top of the bun was falling apart it was so dry.We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've ever had! They also have an \"early dinner\" option if you order before 6 that is very reasonably priced! I had the Quebec rib-eye and it was amazing! Excellent quality and their fois gois just melted in my mouth!  The service is very good as well! Our server made recommendations and we enjoyed the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was here last Friday during their 7th annual Happening Gourmand promotion, where a few restaurants in the Old Port take part in reduced price table d'hote menus. I have dined at Vieux Port Steakhouse on another occasion and can say the quality and portion is usually better when you're paying full price. When we arrived close to 6, the restaurant looked empty but were told everything had been reserved and we would either have to sit at the bar, or finish our meal within an hour and a half. We opted for the latter and were seated at a tiny table, below the staircase, but near the fireplace.  I remember the previous time I was here, my friend and I, early 20's were dressed casually, despite it not being a busy day or time, we were seated on the second floor. It seemed that the main (and nicest) dining area downstairs was kept for the best dressed diners, or fancier looking, mature crowd. I rarely feel this way elsewhere, but I really believe they wanted us hidden. So I strongly recommend a reservation if you want any chance at a good table.  Naturally, serviced was speedy since they wanted us out fast. I ordered a mesclun salad with a dijon honey vinaigrette, filet mignon medallion and blueberry cake on a fixed 25$ menu. My starter was delicious, so simple and sweet that it made me salivate for more to come. Beef was cooked the way I wanted it, accompanied with shrimps and supposed roasted garlic mashed potatoes but I couldn't taste it. The green beans and shrimps were dry, I actually had to smear butter onto them that was intended for my bread.  Right before ordering, the waiter did warn us that it was going to be just one medallion, which implied that there might not be much on the plate and he was right, the portion is much smaller than what I would normally expect. As for dessert, my cake was nothing memorable, I've had tastier supermarket treats.  The special menu is a teaser, a sampler for what this establishment can offer. It may seem like a good opportunity to try this restaurant if you like deals, but for a few dollars extra, you'll be a lot more satisfied. Forgo the salad and generic gateau, get 2 of their filets mignons medallions on a fuller size plate for 29$."}
{"text":"Wanted steak and also wanted to go someplace different.  Came across Vieux-Port during our stroll in Old Montreal.  Menu looked attractive and the patio, or \"garden\" seating sold us.  The place was pretty crowded but the hostess was able to accommodate the four of us.  The waiters appeared busy and did not spend too much time on any one table.  My wife and I ordered wine - the Bordeaux.  The waiter spilled her's and there was wine at the bottom of the stem - sloppy.  My wine was a very non-generous pour.  I blamed the speed of the waiter as opposed to the restaurant trying to be thrifty. I did order a second glass and the pour was better.  The steaks were delicious.  The ribeye was done to perfection; the sirloin the kids ordered was a bit tough.  The bread is to die for!  The only problem with the outdoor seating was the bugs.  There isn't much air movement in the back patio, which encourages the bugs to hang out.  Overall, good food, good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"i came here for sunday brunch. It wasn't as busy as we expected it to be but i think the marathon that had the street closed off played a big part in that. the options were impressive. notable buffet selections were smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, roast beef, beef ribs, canoli, omelette. the fruits were fresh and tasted very good. the desserts, however, were much to sweet for my liking.  an added bonus, in the men's room there were dispensers for mints, chewing gum, and ribbed condoms. very intriguing."}
{"text":"We were a table of 6 and the waiter was extremely patient and friendly with us. Interesting menu with great flavour combinations. Our steak was cooked to perfection and we were happy with the fresh seafood as well. Their goat cheese salad is to die for!!  The only down part is the wait time for our food to arrive at our table. As for the appetizers, the soups also were a bit bland and boring.  Hence, overall, it was a good experience in the middle of Old Port Montreal, and would definitely recommend if you want a good steak!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! My fiancee and I went here. The staff was very welcoming, very attentive and friendly. The food outstanding! I have never had Buffalo and I must say I have been missing out. It was cooked perfect along with my filet mignon. We had French Onion soup and escargot that was so delicious. We finished off with creme brulee flambe that alo g with the view it was delish. Allow around fantastic place to eat. The best meal I had in Montreal,if I came back it would definitely be to eat here."}
{"text":"L'excellentissime! Serveurs au top, plats variés, bien cuits. Nous avons pris les linguini au homard. Un vrai régal."}
{"text":"I have been to this place about 3 times and my latest experience was the best one. Our friendly waiter George was wonderful and the food was really good! We went for the MTL a Table event which makes it even better because the three course meal was only $21! Would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Gives a chance for change rather than always going to the same steakhouse (aka the keg)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! very friendly staff and the food was great! I had the Lunch Special for $23 i got a soup, and a 12oz Rib eye Steak with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies which was very tasty! They also give fresh bread buns with butter as soon as you sit down.  Will go back for sure when we are visiting Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and service. Lobster bisque was ok and onion soup not the best. But the steaks were delicious and the wine is reasonably priced. I have been two times already and would go again."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant itself was lovely. Bigger than I expected on the inside and it's location offers a nice view of the streets of the Old Port. It has a rustic vibe to it.  FOOD: The appetizers and desserts were good but I was very disappointed with my main course. The steaks here were not flavorful, especially once you got towards the middle of the steak. I am usually one who always finishes my plate but I wasn't able to finish this meal. I will not be coming back here again unfortunately.  PRICE: I came here as a business event so I wasn't too familiar with the prices.  SERVICE: Service was good. They were efficient (especially since we were a very large group) and the bartenders were nice as well."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar in the back. Wifi spotty - not available when we were there. Escargot was amazing...so amazing that we got two orders for the both of us. Bartender/waiter who helped us was the best we encountered on our trip. Made the BEST Bloody Ceasars. Seafood (calamari and crab cakes were ok). Stick with the beef and escargot."}
{"text":"If Vieux-Port Steakhouse was a man, I'd hug him, kiss him on both cheeks and smack him on the butt. This place was down right GOOD. Let me set the stage, since I am a writer, and this place just fell into my life like a perfect storybook romance.   It was a chilly evening. The sister and her boyfriend and I had spent the day downtown, shopping and milling about. Our hands were filled with shopping bags with tissue exploding over the tops, hugging our purchases tight.   We took the metro to Place D'Armes, and as soon as we popped to the surface, I gasped. I LOVE Old Montreal. Truly, outside of Paris, there is nothing better in this world than Old Montreal. Nearly skipping, we walked down the street to the port, and sighed as the boats floated in the water, breathed the cool air in as joggers breezed past us ... but in the distance, the skies were black as night, thunder screaming at us, bolts of lightning shooting over the historical area.  Rain began to pour as we turned down Rue St Paul. Boutiques, souvenir shops and restaurants lined the street, each one begging for us to enter. We did, picking up even more shopping bags as we walked. Finally, the rain poured down on the 400 year old cobblestone road and I looked across the street and saw the Vieux Port Steakhouse. So beautiful, so elegant, I knew we had to go in.   We were seated right away and just fell in love with the old world ambiance of this multi-level steakhouse. The food was divine (NY strip), the conversation absolutely wonderful and tea and dessert was lovely. We stayed for hours, talking and laughing and watching the downfall of rain, while our waiter checked on us every once in a while, but mostly leaving us alone in the way you want to be visited with every so often but left to your dinner guests.   I am counting the days until I can go back to this little slice of steakhouse heaven in the most beautiful place I've ever been.   I love you, Vieux Port Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Hostess didn't smile when we walk in. Very unwelcome. Waiters were rushed, broke two glasses during our short visit. Extremely salty food.  Unfriendly staff. Very unprofessional! Too bad I can't choose zero star. Please, for your own sake, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience. The food was delicious! They use fresh calamari. The rib eye steak and the NY strip loin was perfectly cooked. I think what blew us away was the service and the wonderful well lit back patio. :)"}
{"text":"Je suis une fan du brunch du dimanche! pour 25 dollars c'est un peu le buffet club med :) Plusieurs sections à thème et plusieurs cuisiniers qui vous cuisent les oeufs comme vous voulez, les pâtes etc etc Le rapport qualité/prix est excellent, dans un cadre élégant. Depuis que j'ai découvert cette place, c'est là que je brunch avec mes amis le dimanche matin .... C'est smart et bon....juste avant d'aller faire sa promenade du dimanche dans le vieux montréal ...."}
{"text":"Celebrating our anniversary and dining at Restaurant du Vieux Port. Our table wasn't quite ready so the maitre d'hôte offered us a glass of bubbly while we waited in the bar. Impeccable service!!"}
{"text":"I went there last weekend as part of the Happening Gourmand event. The place was packed for a 3 course meal, 23$ deal. We were a large party but our waiter was outstanding and patient. Food was good and quite frankly, the restaurant was better than expected as I thought at first that this was a tourist trap. Not a bad place!"}
{"text":"Très bon resto à ne pas manquer si vous avez le gout dun bon filet mignon. le service est excellent"}
{"text":"Bouffe correcte, ambiance d'antan, vrai feu de foyer, 2etage plein de tables, lumieres tamisées. Service hyper rapide .. l'entrée est arrivée avant le cocktail ... la politique des protocoles du resto est skipé .. just let you know."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the food was pretty good and the steak was juicy and flavorful. I ordered the snails as an appetizer and the Manhattan Steak. First time I tried snail but they weren't too bad and the steak I really enjoyed w/ the sauce.  Now this place gets 3 stars because the server took forever to come and welcome us and take our orders. We were a group of 7 not that huge of a group and dinner was for 3.5 hrs. I do not think he really enjoyed our table and didn't really converse with us at all.  But as I said the food was good, just the service needs to be a bit better..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful night here.  Ate on the back, outdoor, patio which was quite lovely.  Wine list was quite nice and the bottle we got (Carnivor, a tuscan Cab Sauv) was terrific.  Bread was quite good and warm...as it should be.  I had the french onion soup, which was good - but not great.  It needed a bit more broth.  My boyfriend got the lobster bisque and thought it was very good.  We each got steaks (of course) - I got the Filet Mignon, which was cooked perfectly (medium-rare) and the mashed potatoes and haricot vert that accompanied the meats were quite good, he got the bone-in Rib-Eye, which was quite good and, again, cooked perfectly.  He had a baked potato and said it was good, but very dense.  We split a side of mac & cheese, which was very good.  We finished dinner off with a piece of the Chocolate Mousse Cake which was amazing.  We also had a very nice server!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant!! My husband is a meat lover and he really liked his dinner!! The personal is just wonderful!! I can't remember the name of the main host, but we received such an amazing treatment from him. He made everything perfect for our dinner and well our little daughter Clara loved him!  Thanks for everything!! We highly recommend the restaurant and the people who works over there."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the Fiancé. He had the bison ribsteak, I had the ribeye. Both were pretty good. We shared calamari, foie gras and escargot. The foie gras could use a few more toasts. The calamari was ok, need better dipping sauce. The escargot au gratin was yummy, but it's hard to not enjoy anything with melted cheese. Service was good."}
{"text":"A disappointing steak experience and we will absolutely come back! Confused? Here's the story...we booked online and were seated outside promptly at our request. We ordered a bottle of wine, crab appetizer, I had the Porterhouse and my wife had the Filet medallions. Our server was Rodrigo (sp?) and was very pleasant. We never touched the wine bottle as he was continuously topping us up. Now for the meal... The crab was dry and overdone so we didn't finish it. The steaks came, we both ordered our steaks medium. My wife's was perfect but mine was bordering on well done. I mentioned it to the server and he wisked it away for a replacement. The new one came...very rare...not wanting to complain again as I'd already done so twice, I just sucked it up and ate about half. The manager came by, looked at my plate and asked how I had ordered it. I told him medium but I didn't want to complain. He said \"my friend, that steak is blue, for $54 you should get exactly what you wanted\". The bill came...only thing on there was the wine! I know kitchens can get busy and mistakes do happen, and because of the tremendous service we received, we will absolutely be back when we are in Montreal again!"}
