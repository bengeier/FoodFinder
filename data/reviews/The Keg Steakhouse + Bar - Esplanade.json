{"text":"I'm more of an independent restaurant kind of guy but I received a gift-card for The Keg so I decided to give it a try. 

I selected this location because the other two downtown locations (according to Yelp) can have longer wait times for a table at dinner time. We went fairly early (6pm) with no reservation and were seated immediately. Three different people greeted us warmly when we walked in which was nice but a bit overwhelming. 

The decor was very nice, especially the light fixtures. The chairs were comfortable enough not to make me wish we had been seated at a booth. They also had proper salt and pepper mills on the table (as opposed to shakers).

Our server was friendly and was able to make recommendations and answer questions about menu items. She came back and checked in with us once we had received our food but was careful not to interrupt our conversation which was nice. The only negative thing I could say about our server was that she spoke so quickly that we sometimes had difficulty understanding her. 

On to the most important aspect, the meal. The food was good, we could tell that quality ingredients were used, we enjoyed everything we ate, but nothing blew us away. My wife had a cesar salad, it was good, it had shaved parmesan on it and tasty home-made croutons. We shared the spinach, artichoke, and crab dip. Also good but it lacked a certain something to really put it over the top. Some spice perhaps. My wife's steak was cooked perfectly and she enjoyed it very much. I'm not a red meat eater so I ordered the chicken breast with shrimp and scallops which was delicious but I still felt it was lacking some spice or something to kick it up a notch. For dessert we shared a creme brulee. It tasted very good but unfortunately it had been prepared in advance and was cold throughout. In my books, a creme brulee should be cold on the bottom but torched right before serving to make the top warm and crispy adding to the complexity of the dish. I'm sure this is something they could pull off at The Keg.

When we got the bill I found it to be reasonable and in line with the quality of food we had. I would return to The Keg but would sooner go to a cool, independent restaurant if faced with a choice."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner and terrific service. Prices were more than affordable considering other Toronto eateries. Though it's a chain, don't let it sway your decision. This is no Ponderosa."}
{"text":"My wealthy barber friend took 6 of us here for my big birthday dinner a couple of weeks ago.  I've been to 3 other Keg locations in the Toronto GTA (4 if you include the location at 12 Church St around the corner which has since closed and relocated to this address) as this new location opened in March 2010 so my first visit here.

The decor is really nice and contemporary with a big bar in the centre and several fireplaces.  The Keg Mansion on Jarvis has the old world charm but this location takes the cake for reflecting our current times.  It's almost like a page out of those condo magazines... very urban and busy being right across from the Novotel hotel and Sony Centre.

We originally intended on going to the mansion location but they were fully booked so last minute we decided to come here.  Lucky it was a weekday evening as it doesn't accommodate large groups (12-14 max) since it has booths and not many tables in the middle.  It's spacious inside with lots of ambiance and clear walking for the wait staff to bring their large plates to your table.

First, don't go to a seafood joint and expect good burgers. If you're coming here for seafood or chicken, I recommend you seek another place to eat as you may be disappointed.  This is a steak house. A minor beef (sorry for the pun) is the table we had was higher than normal as I checked the surrounding ones which were shorter.  It was a booth but we had no choice as it one of the few that could take 7 people.  So it was a bit strange cos I felt like I was sitting in a high chair... good I suppose for a big cry baby like me :D

Enough blabbing about restaurant design... great sizzle here too as it's not just the steak that is hot but so is the eye candy.  That aside, best steak in the house... rib eye.  Prime rib is good and so is the New York sirloin.  The surprise of the menu is the calamari appetizer (only if you like spicy squid done properly) and trust me on this cos I'm not even a big fan of fishy or chewy calamari... this one is perfect.

The big surprise came at the end of the meal when I couldn't take another morsel of food and the waitress brought me a large piece of birthday cake compliments of the house! I asked her for 7 forks so we split it as there was no way I was going to put that down solo.  It was delicious and apparently special for the Keg so you won't find it elsewhere.

Service was very good, food was excellent, ambiance was great and my overall rating is 5 stars to cap off a superb evening.  It's not cheap as you'll expect to dish out about $50 per person but it's good value.  I've been to Morton's and paid double that but felt I got less value for the same quality.  I strongly recommend you go on your birthday... but do make reservations to avoid disappointment. We liked it so much, that we booked our annual company holiday dinner here.  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Keg in years but since we received a gift certificate we decided to give it a try.  I was really surprised with both the service and the food.  My steak was really tasty and my girlfriend liked her prime rib as well.  Apparently the horseradish was really good also.  I ordered a Manhattan which was only so-so but i think it's really hard to make a good manhattan so i can't be too critical.  the wait for a table was really long but they quickly seated us in the lounge area instead.  The lounge was loud but we didn't mind too much.  The atmosphere was really nice and i could see myself going back with some friends to have dinner and some drinks."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this Keg, they have made it feel very special. From the moment you are greeted at the front door. The d√©cor is quite modern and is very different from The Keg of the past, and I feel is a step in the right direction. Can tell a lot of money was put into making this venue feel top-notch.

Service is always friendly, natural and not over-bearing. Could enjoy my perfectly grilled steak with the server popping in at just the right times to offer more to drink and to ensure everything was going well. Really appreciate good timing of service which often lacks at other restaurants. Overall a great experience each time I have eaten at this Keg."}
{"text":"Good steaks. I liked the old location better..."}
{"text":"This placeis amazing.  The decor and atmosphere create an every enjoyable experience.  This was the best meal I have had in a long time. My steak was cooked to perfection.   Everything was truly excellent to include our server.  Romona was very attentive all evening.  She was the friendliest person we encountered on our vacation in Toronto.  Have to say that we always rate the restrooms of every restaurant we go in and this one was top notch.  Would be out first choice of restaurants when we return to Toronto."}
{"text":"A great place to eat. They cater to families as well, with a straightforward kids' menu. The steaks are unbelievable and so are their appetizers."}
{"text":"I always find that you can't go wrong with the Keg.  I eat at the Esplanade location probably every 6 weeks or so and sometime the York St. location.  While I'd prefer York St. in the Summer as they have a fantastic outdoor area, now that the Esplanade as their front patio, it's really a toss up.  

The food at both locations are consistent with each other as are most Kegs for that matter.  I ate at a Keg in Winnipeg and there was really no difference.  Another think I like about the Keg is they pull a great pint of Heineken.  Strange to say, I know but they're Heineken actually tastes the way it's supposed to.  

The only complaint I would have about this location however is I find it a little dark and after a few bottles of red and a big steak dinner, you can feel pretty sleepy - not a great thing if you're heading here before a night out.

Pricing is ok but I get the feeling they may have gone up over the past year?  
Ambience is good - I recommend sitting in the lounge or patio area over the dinning room.
Staff are ok - I'm not a fan of the whole American, \"Hi, I'm Brittney and I'll be your waiter tonight, \" thing but what I will say is that they are friendly and generally quite knowledgeable about their cocktails, wines, and of course steaks.

This location  seems popular with out of towners and tourists, Bay Streeters seem to keep to York St., and is good for dates and groups."}
{"text":"Visited this Keg location on a Saturday night during a weekend birthday trip to Toronto from NY. I came with a group of 8 and the location does not accept reservations after 5pm on Fridays and Saturdays. We were told to wait for about 20 mins for a table so we grabbed drinks at the bar. The restaurant is very modern with a slight upscale feel. Staff is very attentive, friendly and inviting. I ordered their steak Oscar and the steak was cooked to perfection. All of my friends loved their meals and the restaurant gave me a complementary dessert for my birthday. The Keg is not bad for small chain, definitely worth stopping by for dinner and awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"I like the Keg, but I was really disappointed with my recent experience at the Keg's new location on the Esplanade.  The cut of steak was not good, and the service was SLOW.  The longest part was the waiting between getting the bill, having the bill taken away, and our server finally bringing the credit card machine to accept our payment.  We were waiting so long we wanted to go up to the bar and settle our bill there.  What made it more aggravating was our server kept talking to the table beside us. So we knew what part of the hold-up was. I'm all for being pleasant and courteous - and I do work in the service sector- but you have to take in to consideration that it's a busy night and you have other customers waiting. Also, I liked the atmosphere at the Keg's previous location in the St. Lawrence Market area.  Granted the decor was a bit dated, but it felt like a steakhouse.  The new location felt like a very busy Moxie (the restaurant)-lounge hybrid - dark and loud music.  When 10pm rolled by I half expected staff to push back some tables to make room for a mini-dance floor.  Why do we need another Moxie/Milestones type-restaurant? Those restaurants are fine and I've eaten at them, but the 'old' Keg was different and wouldn't be mistaken for another restaurant. One positive of the night was the host staff were great.  They were friendly and checked in on you so you didn't feel as if you were forgotten, not on the waitlist or your table beeper was broken.   Overall, I was disappointed because of the food, atmosphere and slow service.  If I feel like steak soon I'll check out another steak restaurant or try another Keg location."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Went here with a friend. Our meals actually came out at different times. Without complaint or prompt, the chef brought out my dish, apologized and offered us free dessert. They went out of their way to right a very minor thing. Well done!"}
{"text":"2  tables  on the patio empty for about 20 minutes, that the hostess \"thought someone was waiting for.\"  Ok, let's sit at the bar.  Apparently, the burly looking guy at the bar with 2 seats near him is \"expecting someone to come join him in about 10 minutes.\"  

I am generally a fan of the Keg, but considering the attitude, hope this location goes out of business really soon!"}
{"text":"Sheer disappointment with the food. I've been to many KEGs before, but the food here was the worst.

The steak we ordered was too salty as if the cooks had dipped our food in a platter of salt. We couldn't really taste the meat because the seasoning was so off putting. Even the accompaniments were seasoned un-evenly, like some mushrooms being too salty or bland. It was as if the cooks sprinkled salt on it three-four times from far away, hitting only a few mushrooms, leaving them so salty. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were made in the morning hours ago, thus starting to get this bittersweet taste due to long exposure in the air. 

Overall, the food was disgusting and I will never be returning here. Please go check out another KEG or a different steakhouse in downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"My gf and I went here for my birthday dinner when visiting Toronto (Nov '15).  We weren't fans of the first table they sat us at, and asked if we could be moved... they had no problem with that, and put us right next to a fireplace, which was great.  Our waiter wasn't bad, but didn't seem very friendly.  The food was fantastic though!  My steak was cooked perfectly to order, and although I didn't expect to be able to finish them all, we ordered a few sides to split because they sounded so good.  -And they were.  Everything we ate was absolutely delicious... one of my best-ever birthday meals.  I thought the prices were pretty reasonable based on the quality and quantity of food.  They had a pretty good beer selection, if I recall, as well.  My only regret is that we couldn't finish all of the delicious sides we ordered (although it was well worth the cost). If any of my friends make their way to Toronto, I will definitely recommend this particular Keg restaurant!"}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night.  Waited maybe 30 min for a table.  Hostess staff at the front desk were wonderful.  I had a service dog in training with me named Denver and they were so accommodating and fantastic.  They were the same with the last service dog I used to bring in as well.  Food and drinks  of course were amazing!  We continue to go back to The Keg because of the people, the food and how we are treated with the service dog.  They never even blink and eye and we appreciate and love this!!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this Keg location - great food, great service and great location.  Being one of the newer Kegs the restaurant itself is very nice and we love sitting by the fireplace in the bar.  Love the bread and whipped butter, always eat too much of it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the food was fantastic. Atmosphere was also very nice. Would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I think this was my favorite Keg to visit! 
We had a beautiful spot near the fire place, and enjoyed some great people watching. There seemed to be a lot of business men dining together. I went with my family and enjoyed the steak and half lobster feature. I have enjoyed better steaks elsewhere, the Keg steaks are often very salty and that is what you remember about them. However, the reason I give this Keg a 4 star rating is because  I find there steak to be very consistent in quality. I enjoying knowing that when I visit the Keg I will be getting exactly what I order, there is something nice and warming about the Keg. 
And thats why I will go back ."}
{"text":"The perfect place to go with my steak-loving husband.  He comes away the happiest man on earth, and I come away fully satisfied too.   Steaks are tasty (I'm not steak aficionado, but I know I always enjoy mine), and the sides are delicious.  Always a very filling and satisfying meal.  

Desserts are nice.   The warm bread before the meal is a nice touch.  Service is friendly and attentive for the most part.

There's always a wait on weekends, but you can wait by the bar, or take bar seating which sometimes comes up faster if you don't mind where you eat.  

Nice atmosphere.  Feels clean and current.  Gives the impression of a nice night out, even when you are pregnant (I am ) or when there are kids at nearby tables (there were).   It still has a hip and happening feel to it."}
{"text":"The service and food was incredible at this Keg.  My fianc√©e and I celebrated our engagement here.  They went above and beyond in their generosity and professionalism.  Our server, Chantelle, was attentive, helpful, and friendly. We were even given a congratulatory and complimentary dessert and card.

We would strongly recommend this Keg and we will definitely return. Thank you to management and our server."}
{"text":"This place is like a billion stars restaurant!!!! I have never had a steak this delicious like the one from the keg. It is a real piece of heaven and the place, the wine, the service there, everything was awsome. My very best advice for you-never miss the chance to visit this place or you will regret that for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. Both times, the food and service were excellent. They even brought me free birthday cake (Billy Miner pie) on the second occasion since we were celebrating my birthday. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I just went there the second time in 3 days. My go to place for consistent quality steak. The decor is quite nice as well. Next time I will try out the patio seating."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the Keg is great.  I had outstanding sea bass over quinoa.  The quinoa was overly salty :( but everything else was good.  Salad was what one could expect maybe even a tad better. Service was excellent. Service was outstanding. A solid four."}
{"text":"There are a ton of reviews already on the food at the Keg so I'll make mine short and focus on this location. 

Located on the esplanade at the base of a condo building.  Restaurant is fairly large with lots of comfy seating.  Was here on a cold snowy night this past winter and got seated next to the lovely fire. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and charming but not overly so.  Ambiance is great, you weren't distracted by loud music or chatter from other patrons (like how most restaurants are nowadays) .

Food was great (for a chain) and wines are well priced."}
{"text":"Been there twice over a long period of time. Both times the standards were upheld. Great sirloin (take it medium at most, Mmm juicy!), great starters. The cheesy garlic bread is very nice as far as cheesy garlic bread goes. The garlic shrimp is nice as well, could use more shrimps but they use good quality cheese throughout their dishes and it shows. 

The service is good as well. The nice waitress gave my mom a nice chocolate ice-cream cake slice when she found out it was her bday. 

Can get pricey. Not too bad tho."}
{"text":"I have frequented this location many times, the ambiance is great, the staff is professional and the food is always amazing! The Ahi Tuna is always fresh and a great starter! The top sirloin is loaded with flavour. Those mushrooms, wow, better than magic mushrooms! A trip is never complete without a billy miner pie, packed with more deliciousness than 31 flavours! 

Side note: the ribs are good, but if you're going to the Keg don't not order a steak, you'll just look on in envy when everyone is eating that sweet juicy meat."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location for The Keg!!!!

We have been a handful of times and it just gets better and better every time!

The decor and ambiance are so nice especially in the Winter if you ask to sit by a fireplace. The best!

The service from every person you come in contact with is exceptional.

The food is wonderful- if they don't get your steak perfectly right, they will get you another one AND not charge you for your meal. All with a smile.

They also ask if you are celebrating anything. which we weren't but I assume they bring you a little dessert if you are :)  Not sure. I bet they do.

I feel like there must be so many great restaurants in Toronto to try but on a Saturday night we always end up at The Keg on the Esplande because we KNOW it's going to be an awesome meal, fabulous service and all for a reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite keg locations, been to mansion, oshawa, ajax, leslie and vaughan...

4 stars at the old location a definite 5 now At the new spot.
Great service 
Best steak house prices

Seating isnt cramped as another user suggested(maybe at the bar?)
Loud?? if a big group is seated close to you and they're loud, what can you do? Cant fault the keg for that, if you want quiet come when they open or go to the octagon and pay 3 times more."}
{"text":"This restaurant has beautiful decor, making it a wonderful place to go on a date. Its dimly lit, avant-garde furniture, light fixtures and colours, manifest a relaxed, chic atmosphere. Their food rivals the atmosphere. My medium rare steak and potatoes were legendary. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, topped with butter and a few other spices while the steak was jus how I like it, tender and juicy. I will be returning here!"}
{"text":"So we made a reservation for 10 at 8:00pm as we were doing a surprise birthday party with the birthday girl arriving at 8:30PM. When we got in at 8, they said the table wasn't ready because those diners has been there over their time expectation. So we waited and waited and when the birthday girl arrived the table still wasn't ready! (what a way to ruin the surprise!) So the table was finally ready by 9PM and you'd figured that after peak hours and the long wait of which they apologized for, the food would come quicker. We waited another hour for food and the whole dinner didn't finish until almost 11!!  Imagine most of us have work the next morning, what an awful experience we had here. Never coming to this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome!  Not the GREATEST steakhouse but is great, considering the price and amazing service.  Great \"loungy\" ambiance with good appetizers, food and service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best keg! Ever!!! Everything was great, and i almost wish i had a complaint. Steak-on point- creme brulee- awesome. Done"}
{"text":"Wow. Better than I expected. 
New York steak was cooked to perfection. Loaded baked potato and side of veggies (green beans, red pepper and mushrooms) were yummy. 
Staff was super friendly, patient and helpful at making suggestions for our indecisive group.  Great atmosphere for a great night out!  Worth every penny. 
Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner yesterday. We were in a rush as we had another reservation at a bar afterwards that we couldn't miss.  We had about an hour from the time we arrived to the time to had to leave but we didn't tell our waitress.

We order calamari to start and I had the 6oz top sirloin steak which was extremely reasonably priced ($22). Calamari and bread came within a few minutes and our entrees came soon after.  Our server Renee was attentive but not overly pushy.  She had a great personality and made our visit very enjoyable.   The Calamari was very fresh,  not a hint of fishy flavor.   My steak was very flavorful,  cooked to perfection.   For the price I paid I wasn't expecting the best cut of beef but it was top notch steak.  Side of veggies and twice baked potato are a great accompaniment with the savory sirloin. 

We were able to finish in time to make our reservation at the bar, bellies full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Probably the best Keg in the city. Yes, even better than the Keg mansion. It's more of a swanky, chill vibe (especially on Fridays) and their customer service is always on point. We even had the general manager, Blaire, come by to welcome us and check in on our meal! In terms of the food, it's pretty damn good and we didn't even end up having steak. For starters, we had the bacon wrapped scallops (amazing) and the baked Brie which is an ABSOLUTE must try! I know it sounds ridiculous to spend $12 on cheese but this one is so worth it. For dinner we had chicken and ribs with a side of their special jus (ps you have to ask for it!). Chicken was super tender and we didn't even need the jus but it definitely enhanced our experience. To top it off, we had the always delicious Billy miners pie. If you've never tried this before, you've wasted your life."}
{"text":"I could not have been more pleased with this experience!

My fianc√© and I are in Toronto for a couple Tragically Hip shows and wanted to have at least one of our meals be on the more upscale, sit-down dinner side of dining. The Keg Steakhouse was the perfect place for this. 

The setting is intimate but not intimidating or overwhelming. It's dim and comfortable. All of the service members greet you whole-heartedly and genuinely welcome you to their space. Our server for the night (I believe it was Chandra - thank you Chandra) was an absolute home run. She gave us a complimentary piece of their signature ice cream toffee/coffee/caramel cake just because we had never been here before and she said we couldn't leave without trying it. It was delicious and much appreciated. People don't do things like that anymore.  

For the food that we actually ordered, we got bacon-wrapped scallops ($12 for 6) that melted in your mouth. I ordered steak Oscar in a creamy garlic sauce that came with more scallops and delicious shrimp. Fianc√© got a steak and lobster. Lobster was a little difficult to crack open but once that was taken care of he really enjoyed it. 

We both drank Bloody Caesars that were made very well, the perfect amount of kick to them. 

I would definitely not pass this place up if you are looking for something a little beyond pub fare! Great food and great service."}
{"text":"This was, as always, a fabulous night!  I was celebrating my 50th birthday, and it was great!  Great food, great service, a reservation for 15 without problem or hassle (And importantly, without wait)...everything was perfect...truly a night to remember!

The staff was friendly, and their attention to detail was exceptional!

I highly recommend this particular Keg to anyone wanting a special night out...worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Kegs and this one was a bad experience. The server would take forever to come back to our table. We had to go and find another server to help us out, who then would waste time looking for our server. The food was great, just the servers need to more helpful."}
{"text":"This Keg is always an underwhelming experience when compared to the one in York street. It's a combination of the frugal servings (less pepper sauce), layout and overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first exposure to this chain was not very pleasant. I tried a couple of their locations when I first moved up to Canada and found the steaks to be over salted. With decent alternates available at that time I moved to another local chain which sadly closed its doors a few years ago but nonetheless the impression was set and I sorta settled on keeping that spot mainly for drinks. 
When the newish location opened nearby my experience here was mainly for drinks as they have a petite sirah that made an impression and patio is inviting in the summer. The bar area is not shabby as well and one can just hangout and chat away.
Anyway long story short wanting to get my steak fix and a Keg gift card burning a hole in my wallet I decided to give this place a go for food. With friends in tow we tried to reserve a spot but sadly none allowed on the weekend after 530 on weekends. My friends walked in earlier and didn't have any issue getting a decent spot as it was still early for dinner.
I decided to order the NY strip with the pepper sauce and a side of fries and greens. 
My friends went for the filet mignon (which luckily can be had without the bacon wrap for people who don't want it) 
Learning from our experience we requested the chef hold the salt way back (the peppercorn sauce would have the salt kick in my case anyway) and we waited they brought a nice warm bread which went well.
Now for the main the steak was done to my liking. The fries are decent as well. The service is immaculate from start to finish (I have experienced it to be great even while just having drinks) which pushed it above the other chain offerings IMO.
They are not inexpensive by any means for a meal but neither are they heavy on wallet as the steak houses can run into $$$$ with wine in some cases.
3.5 stars for the meal with a 4 star if you want to just have drinks in this area."}
{"text":"What a lovely evening!!! We scored and we seated next to the fire place on on a damp evening. The interior design was gorgeous, loved all of the over sized seating and romantic lighting. 

There were three in our party, we ordered the strip loin, it was delicious, tender and succulent. 

The baseball cut, it was okay... at some parts in the steak it was a bit too chewy. 

Both were served with grilled veggies, and we ordered the garlic mash which was really delicious.

And the special of day, which was lamb chops with root vegetable mash. The chops were beyond delicious, the root mash was another story, under cooked and a little crunchy... if I was offered that special again I would ask them to sub the garlic mash. 

We also ordered the ice cream cake, maybe it was called billy miner or something... it was REALLY DELICIOUS!! Make sure you order it!!!

The service was also beyond my expectations, our servicer was so kind, sweet and tentative! 
Top notice!!!"}
{"text":"I go to The Keg a lot, but this was my first time at the Esplanade. The food was incredibly bland, no one at my table finished more than 30% of their steak. Lobster was really dry. Appetizers were bland, sides were bland. Steak tasted just awful and was cut poorly as well.

I love other locations of The Keg though. The only reason we went to this location was because it closed slightly later."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because of the service. The food is always good, and no complaints from me about the food. 
I came by on Thursday night and our server, girl with blonde hair and ponytail, barely checked on us. She came by once. The whole meal I had nothing to drink. 
Our finished plates sat in front of us for 30mins! 
I felt neglected tbh. Normally I have a good experience at the keg, not last Thursday."}
{"text":"There aren't many places out there that provide you with a succulent piece of meat for an affordable price. This place is definitely the place to go when you're looking for fine dining for a great price! I love the atmosphere, the service, the mood, the setting, the lighting the appetizers/food/desserts, the whole 9 yards! We have been to so many locations all over Toronto and have never been disappointed! My favorite used to be the peppercorn steak, their peppercorn sauce is delicious (only if you love the bite you get when you chew on a peppercorn, if you don't, this steak is not for you!), but after trying their walnut encrusted steak with goat's cheese, I have never gone back to the peppercorn one! I understand that steak is supposed to be eaten without all the fancy shmancy sauces & condiments but they go so incredibly well with the steak! My bf who is also a steak lover orders the steak without any special sauce and he's never been disappointed either! So the point is, you get a great deal for a great price! I like their Caesar salad too, it's the right amount of creamy, tangy, and fresh! I have tried their creme brulee with passion fruit and it was delish and came in a pretty big serving! All in all, this is our go-to place anytime we want a good meal and not sure about what to eat! I hope the quality remains the same if not better in the future as well!!"}
{"text":"I am a Keg Steakhouse fan, but there is only one word to describe tonight's Keg =  Substandard. First, the wait was long - 45 mins. We ordered the prime rib, and it had too much fat.(2/3 fat) I also ordered the Vanilla Strawberry Martini, and it tasted like the cough syrup I took 2 weeks ago.  The trio sample - sweet potato fries + mushroom caps + asparagus were alright. The best part of the meal would have to be the chocolate mint candy that came with the bill.  Just when we thought we can just pay and forget this night ever happened, it took forever for the server to bring the credit card machine by. She was busy chatting up the table next to us. Meh ~ Substandard...."}
{"text":"I went there last year when it first reopened on the Esplande. I should have joined Yelp then! Once again they proved to be worth every penny and one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. I had the Mother's Day Prix Fixed special. 

The appetizer was the Caesar salad, which I discovered does not come with bacon anymore due to food sensitivities. 

The entree was  the Filet Mignon, which was succulent and a mouthful of flavours exploding in my mouth! hmm the Applewood bacon was amazing! (they can serve that with steak but not with my salad?!) Accompanying the steak were my King Crab legs and they were divine with the melted butter. I had the server pour the butter from the tiny overflowing glass bowl to my bowl for the crab shells! I like to let my crab legs soak in the butter for a bit. 

Then the Billy Miner's dessert; which was a slice of orgasmic pleasure with the mocha, caramel, chocolate and almonds melting in my mouth. Thank goodness my friend was there to share it with me, as it is a huge slice!

The server Ashley was superb! Friendly, personable, charming and ever so accommodating."}
{"text":"This Keg is the best Keg.  We've been here about 4 times in the last year and a half and each time has been excellent but two visits stand out.  Both of those times included our favourite waiter named Hamoudi (sorry if I spelled that wrong!).  

We came to the Keg to celebrate a promotion I got at work.  Hamoudi was an excellent waiter, consistently filled our water glasses and just was overall an excellent, excellent employee.  Then, he surprised me with a slice of complimentary cake and a card signed by the Keg staff congratulating me.  I was so happy with this experience.

Yesterday, I had to put down a pet and was extremely sad but wanted to try and go out to eat.  Hamoudi was once again our waiter and he inquired about our evening.  I explained why we were there and he was extremely sympathetic and did not make me feel like a crazy cat person.  In fact, he relayed a story to me about his gf's pet passing away and it made me feel much better.  We then had our meals, ordered dessert and he actually brought us out a piece of ice cream cake, just like before, to make us feel better.

Hamoudi is great!  And this Keg is great!  We'll definitely be back again.  Best Keg in Toronto, hands down!"}
{"text":"good steak, long line-ups but expected for the quality and consistent service, nice decor, friendly service - 1 for the 1 hr wait and parking"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location more than I can count. I'm not sure why I'm even just reviewing it now. 

I love The Keg, I've always been a fan. It's hands down one of the best chain restaurants out there. 

They are one of the few restaurants that gets my steak right. I'm a self-proclaimed chef so I'm very picky with how I like my steak done. 

Ambience - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 6/5"}
{"text":"My first time at this keg location and it has a beautiful classy decor atmosphere. Service was amazing & the food was great. Their bread comes hot and the inside is so fluffy and outer is crispy! Their prime rib was delicious w a tiny bit of horseradish gave it a kick!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner.  Our party of 12 were all very impressed with the great food and service!  I had a few cocktails and the tuna tacos.  The drinks weren't watered down like you get at some venues.  The tacos were very tasty as was my fudge brownie dessert was just the right amount of sweetness.  A few friends ordered the steak which was done perfectly to their specification.  

I liked the layout of the restaurant as you're able to be quite separate from other tables so you can hear everyone at your table.  At some places it's hard to hear over other people's conversations and music in the background.  The server was very attentive and made sure all our drinks were topped up as needed.  He took pics for us and was really friendly.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for the great atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago with some friends who all agreed that the Keg is THE place to go for the best steak in the world.  Being a bit of a cynic as I am, I decided to try it out and draw my own conclusion as everyone's tastes and palettes are unique and individual.  We had gone on a Friday night, and unfortunately they do not take reservations, so we risked it and went anyways.

I was the first one to arrive, and the hostess told me they wouldn't have any tables free until 9PM (it was 7PM and at this moment I'm thinking FML).  Of course, whenever you're dining in this area of downtown, there are always long waits as it's the financiers and condo crowd all fully exploiting the conveniences known as restaurants that blockade the St. Lawrence Market area.  We were a party of 6, and I was really hungry, so after a bit of pleading to see if they could accomodate us, they finally did, in the lounge area, which was fine.

After having dined here, I must agree that the statement my friends made about the Keg were not overgeneralizations.  Their steaks are indeed juicy and succulent.  I love how the fat just melts in your mouth (some people shave that part off the steak and don't eat it, but for me, that is part of the experience of devouring a good steak).  

We also had the Ahi Tuna Appetizer to share, and the mushrooms that came with it, were to die for... Although every time I went to grab a spoonful to add to my crostini, I couldn't help but think of the poor mice that proved that MSG is fatal if consumed in large quantities, it was REALLY salty but oh so tasty!

To finish it off, I had a Billy Miner Pie to share with one of my DC's, and it is one of the best desserts from a chain restaurant I've had (my ultimate favourite is the White Chocolate Brownie from Moxies Bar & Grill).  However, if you are health conscious, do not look at the nutritional information on the Keg's website as to how many calories are in one of these or you'll never get to try this divine treat!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why I generally avoid the Keg - I've always had the impression it was just a steakhouse, and I don't usually have steaks. Although I was recently here with a friend for drinks, and I was wrong. They have a pretty impressive cocktail/drinks menu. I only had a drink - the burnt orange old fashioned, and it was simply perfect. I didn't have food this time, but I did look at the menu and there's more to it than steaks. 

Definitely worth a visit no matter what you are into."}
{"text":"Every time we come here (about once every two months) our experience is great. The food is almost always delicious and the service is impeccable.  One thing that would take this restaurant from a 4.5 to a 5 star is consistency. On several occasion the mashed potatoes and vegetables have tasted quite different from the last. They have never been a disaster, but you'd think that a restaurant of this caliber would at least have recipes for all its dishes and hire chefs who will follow them."}
{"text":"We were lured in from the Esplanade by the large patio. I liked the modern atmosphere, the fire places are a great touch, and there is a bar on the patio (yay, less time to wait for drinks!). In addition they have a nice beer selection...which I should've guessed with a name like 'The Keg'.

We had the escargot to start, which was decent. My friend order the Thai Chicken with rice and grilled veggies and I had a taste...again decent, but then the true star of the show came around and 'she' was something else. Their filet wrapped in bacon will literally melt in your mouth. It was cooked to perfection and all of the flavors were just in the right place (yes, we ARE still talking about food)."}
{"text":"pretty disappointed.  came here with a group of people for lunch.  Ive been to the keg over 50 times in my lifetime, other kegs in differnet regions across ontario and generally there is a standard across the board that my family and i have been happy with and appreciated the dining experience.  

With that said, the food took a long time to arrive, even though our party was booked in advance, it seemed due to the holiday they had a few parties going on and they should have prepared better for this.  This wasn't the bulk of my problem, a few people ordered prime rib at my table and they all came out close to BLUE/rare and we had to send back the plates after waiting a long time to get the food to begin with.  The waitress said they would be medium/rare and it was, almost straight off the butcher..without being cooked, it actually looked disgusting.  So we sent it back, we didn't make a big deal about it but the reaction on the servers face wasn't pleasant.  It wasn't the original server but she came as a helper.
At the end of the day, its attitude that matters, and i didn't appreciate how she treated us like a nuisance, even when you dont say it out loud you can sense, people being annoyed, and at the end of the day, the customers preference and experience matters.

When i ate the prime rib again, its almost as if they dropped it in a pile of salt by \"accident\".
I didn't send it back because at the end of the day you don't want to be that customer that complains ...
 but my coworker said the same...
Anyway, pretty disappointed..hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Usually we can't get in this place it's so busy, especially before a Leaf game.
We made reservations, being a Thursday, and it was great (and it still filled up fast).
Our food was excellent as was our waiter Adonis. 
French Onion soup, excellent
Our NY Striploins were perfection
A+ night out before going to a comedy show at the ACC."}
{"text":"This chain is a Canadian institution, good for a quick lunch or for a romantic sit down dinner. We were there at lunch and the service was very attentive, service and cycle time of when the food, drinks, appetizers came out wasn't well structured so there were gaps. However it was good, just not spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice location conveniently located right by the Air Canada Centre, cheap(er) parking and a hotel across the street. Service was good, steak was amazing and just super flavourful as always, and of course, the bill came up to an arm and a leg as per usual. But I really love The Keg's Cesars--they're honestly the tastiest Cesars out there with the perfect amount of spice to it. Needless to say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service, failry large bar area you can seat yourelf in if there is a wait for talbes, nice sized patio for summer dining, always great service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was cozy and not too loud. We originally made reservations for 2, but had a person join us last minute after we were already seated. The host and server had no issues with the table change and quickly moved us to a bigger table. The service was great and the food perfect. Our server rolled with the punches and she took the time to get my co-worker's crazy drink request right. Kudos to her for that. I know it's not easy doing things off menu, but she did with a smile on her face. 

It's a great Steakhouse and the service just makes it all that better. Plus the bathrooms are pretty swanky. I'll be back for sure on my next trip."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times.  It's the Keg - it delivers exactly what you expect it to deliver - delicious meat.    I'm a sucker for the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes.  

Here's a tip:  Don't eat the bread!  It will fill you up and you won't have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This was a great steakhouse!  It was great food, great ambiance, and great service.  I will certainly be returning to this place anytime I am in town."}
{"text":"Excellent stake and fantastic service. They tend to overcook the steak a little, so ask for a less-done steak than you usually would."}
{"text":"waiter was quick and concise with her explanations about the menu and came around often to check on us, very good service. The interior is decent. I had the prime rib which tasted good, was flavourful and juicy.  I can't really tell between steaks though. 

Overall, it's decent but the presentation of the dish reminds me of chain restaurants. Everything was served on one large plate and the type of side dish such as salad and potato are fast food like. A bit surprised as it's my first time at the keg."}
{"text":"Delicious food and courteous staff. I had the Thai chicken and finished every savory morsel. The on site manager was so sweet and came by to say hello and gave us a free dessert which was scrumptious. Def will be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Can't find too many places better foe a steak. Seeing that the price to buy a fine piece of meat is pretty comparable, the keg is a deal now! Great service, excellent drinks, twice baked, and a thick steak is the perfect Friday night. 

You can find better steak, but it will cost you an arm and a leg! The keg can get you a quality meal and atmosphere for a reasonable price. I have never been disappointed visiting the keg."}
{"text":"got the teriyaki sirloin set when I visted last December.  set came with a Caesar salad and twice baked potato as a side. not bad for $28. service was attentive and the restaurant was nice and modern looking. will be back"}
{"text":"Listen it's hard to differentiate The Keg from. other places and even from other Keg restaurants, but I'll try. first off location is a great. right along the esplanade with a good amount of dining and bar space.

There's a green p large lot nearby to accommodate parking and if you're seeing a show at the Sony Centre (as we were) this is a great spot for pre show meal or post show meal/drinks. ours were of the former and had a pre show bottle of wine with dinner.

atmosphere

first off this place on most evenings, especially with a show coming is going to be extremely busy. they don't take reservations during those times so please do expect to wait.

even the bar was full but the best thing is you can open and start your tab at the bar, start with an appetizer and wait for the little beeper to go off. it's what we did and right away the best item on the wine menu is a bottle for $24 of Pelham. it's great value with any meal.

had calamari and instead of steaks went with their burgers with twice baked potato. classic combo and tasted as I expect which was delicious! aside from the wait times can't say I'm upset. service was good, fast and attentive.

food was cooked quickly and properly and atmosphere, especially when busy is a nice place.

no complaints and would come here again as Ill know what to expect. also a great place to use a gift card."}
{"text":"Four of us went to this Keg last night for an early dinner. We were seated immediately and the service was excellent, our coats were even checked for us at the table which was necessary because the booths are pretty small. It has the same dimly-lit, romantic ambiance as all the other Kegs at which I have dined. There is still not much selection on the menu in the way of greens, but it is a steak house afterall. In an attempt to be healthy I got the cauliflower steak from the \"Casual Plates\" section of the menu; the chickpea & sundried tomato relish and asparagus were all good, but the cauliflower itself was dry and hard and I couldn't finish it. I expected the cauliflower to have been more cooked (as in steamed or boiled) but it was just grilled, so I wouldn't get it again. I would say stick to ordering what The Keg is good at, meat. The washrooms were quite fancy and clean. After 6pm on weekends you can park in the Green P parking complex at the foot of Church St. for $6 flat, but if you get there before 6pm you are paying $2.50/half hour, so street parking might be a better option."}
{"text":"The only thing preventing this place from receiving a perfect score from me would be that my daughter's chicken dish was very dry..  NO matter HOW you prepare a chicken dish, IF the chicken is dry well hey....  
My filet was the best I have ever eaten and my wife said the same thing about her salmon. Mother in law really enjoyed her sirloin as well..   The prices were not cheap but alas I have paid more for meals and had way less quality than what we experienced here today !!   We would for sure if ever given the occasion return for another wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food was spot on!  The staff was very knowledgable and accommodating. 

The Steaks are fantastic along with their signature appetizers!  The bacon wrapped scallops and baked shrimp were great!

We ate on the back patio/terrace...weather was nice and the bar out there is wonderful."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Steakhouse.  Last night's meal was spot on. Great staff, fantastic host team and always quality eats. The Rib Steak was cooked a perfect medium last night. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Well worth the money.  Atmosphere perfect after a full day of sightseeing in Toronto.  The food was excellent.  I had the lobster tacos.  Yummy!  Hubby had steak and lobster.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.  Steak cooked to perfection.  Son had the pistachio topped salmon with Brussel sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes.  He ate every bite including the sprouts!  He said several times how much he enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes too!  Recommended to us by a friend and we will definitely be recommending this place!!!"}
{"text":"After experiencing an average visit at the Mississauga location, my sister and I decided to try this location since we were in the area. We were going to dine out on the patio but it was quite hot so we decided to dine indoors. The interior is decorated very nicely with modern colours, light fixtures, and furniture.

We were greeted by a very friendly and cordial host who got us seated pretty quick. He even made small talk as we were guided to our table. When we were seated we waited about 10 minutes until our server arrived. There was no one in the restaurant besides us so we were wondering what was taking so long. This was when I lowered my rating by 1 star...keep reading to see why it went back up. However, the server was very friendly and told us about their specialty prime rib and checked up on us occasionally to see how we were doing.

Since it was my sister's belated birthday dinner, we went all out. Our massive order included: a virgin daiquiri (even though she's legal now -_-), bacon wrapped scallops, prime rib with tiger shrimp, and prime rib with crab legs. I was slightly disappointed with their bread because it was just warm and it didn't taste oven fresh like the last time I had it. The appetizer and entree's were delicious and tasted fresh. When we got our entrees my jaw literally dropped because the plate was HUGE! No, I did not finish everything on my plate...only french fries were remaining (extra carbs anyways =P)!

The bill came up to approximately $100 but since The Keg gave us a $25 gift card after reading my previous review, it made my stomach feel a bit better paying that much for my sister and I (when we are students)."}
{"text":"Have been to this location multiple times now. I really like the area and the service is always really great. I went on Monday night for my birthday and they were very busy. Wish now I had asked to be seated in a booth as a really loud annoying couple were seated right beside me. 

However, the food was really good, I had the Teryaki top sirloin. My boyfriend ordered the 3 way steak (as it is on now for a limited period). He did say however that the 3 sauces sucked, especially the peppercorn :P

Our server was so attentive and friendly, without being too much. They also gave me a complimentary dessert on account of it being my birthday. I really like this place, I probably wouldn't try the 3 way steak's though."}
{"text":"We went 2 nights in a row to this same Keg. The food was delicious. 10oz Fillet with a twice baked potato. What's not to like. Ice cold beer to wash it all down. It was all fabulous! This is for sure a do-over when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"VENUE 5/5 

I really like this decor. The lights might be dimmed, but they have 4 or 5 fireplaces spread in the dinning room, so it brings a very nice light. The seats are comfy and there a good space between the tables, making it intimate. 

FOOD 4/5 

Escargot - Served with mushrooms in a curry sauce. Accompanied with a bread bun. Tasted really good, a nice change from the traditional garlic butter - cheese  type of dish. 

12oz top sirloin served with vegetables- I asked rare, and it was how I received it. Very tender and flavorful. The vegetables were nice but a little too bland. 

SERVICE 

5/5 

Our waitress was extremely pleasant. She explained the daily specials very well, was very attentive, smiling and classy. She also knew her wines very well and suggested a great Merlot that pleased us both. Our water glasses were consistently filled."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I've ever been to The Keg, and I'm glad I decided to go to this location! 

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The inside of this restaurant is classy and romantic, and the environment is calm and relaxing. The lighting is dimmed, but not too dark that you can't see your food or the person you're with. 

We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start,$12. It was definitely worth it, the scallops were so tender and the bacon was a nice touch. Definitely a unique dish I would recommend. 
I ordered the 10oz Fillet Mignon cooked medium (bacon wrapped) $42, it was really good. I got the twice baked potato on the side, not really a fan of that. I didn't realize it would be that over-baked, I didn't taste much potato, more of a burnt flavour instead. 
My boyfriend ordered the Sirloin Oscar with garlic mashed potatoes on the side $38, he said it was very good. 

The service here is pretty good. The host working last night was really nice. While walking to our table he asked if we were celebrating anything, and I mentioned it was my boyfriend's birthday. After being seated, I walked back to the front to ask him if he could tell our server we're celebrating a birthday. He said he was already ahead of me and told the server to bring us a free dessert (Billy Miner Pie), how sweet! Our server was nice too, checked up on us regularly, filled our wine glasses when she noticed it was getting low. 

I would definitely come here again, and for sure recommend this location."}
{"text":"Friends gave Gord a gift certificate for his birthday for the Keg ... and we used it this evening.

We sat in the lounge by a fireplace.

While I had a glass of Riesling, Gord had a mojito.

Christina was our server and she started us off with some yummy bread ... it was crunchy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.

 Gord ordered Mushrooms Neptune and said it was good.  As his main, ordered Chicken Oscar with Rice Pilaf.  He said it was good and he'd order it again.

I ordered BBQ Chicken and Ribs with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.   The ribs were okay ... the chicken and mashed potatoes were really good.

Christina was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Always a fan of The Keg. Came before a Leafs pre-season game...

Walked up to the patio and we were able to seat ourselves. We got drinks pretty quickly and appetizers shortly after. I had my usual, the teriyaki classic. Our steaks were cooked well and we were able to get in and out before the game. 

Never a bad experience at the many Keg's I've been to, and the streak continues!"}
{"text":"Consistency. That's what the Keg is synonymous with. Nothing falls short at this location either. 

Each location has it's own vibe, and this one feels a little tucked away, catering to fast diners trying to catch a show or a game, or out of town guests staying in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Oh, the Keg...the best of everything! I (of course) made snotty remarks about the hordes of half-dressed sitting hostesses lurking around the place, but frankly they are not too hard on anyone's eyes :)). The service was impeccable, the escargot that I had beyond delicious (if I could politely lick the bowl, I would), but my much loved Top Sirloin steak had a bit too much pepper in it - I had to drink water after each bite. It was still good,juicy, medium rare, just too spicy for me. I've passingly mentioned it to the waitress (well, she's asked how everything was :)), and within seconds my plate was taken away from me (my hubby's as well, to keep it warm) only to be replaced with a brand new steak and sides. Mind you, the new steak was unseasoned (understandably), but I could add salt and pepper to my heart's delight. The manager came to apologize profusely for such an inconvenience - but little did I expect to have my main course removed from the bill! Its a bit insane - not only they've replaced my quarter-eaten steak with a brand new one, they've reimbursed us for it! Love the Keg!

The ambience is great, modern and chic, but not snobbish, I love that you can come to this place dressed in jeans and still get an Octagon or Canoe -level service. The consistency of meals is amazing: we've tried the Keg at Niagara Falls, North York, and two other downtown locations: if you order it medium rare, you get it medium rare. It's not medium or blue - it's just perfect. 
Needless to say, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a great place!

To start with, the service was spot on. Speedy service, yet the food was fantastic. The restaurant is very nice inside with a nice fireplace."}
{"text":"This Keg is located on the Esplanade just East and one block South of the Sony Centre. I came here with a friend for a mid-week dinner. 

Usually the Keg is reserved for special occasions in my circle of friends/family so to come on a regular old weekday was a bit out of the ordinary for me. My friend and I arrived and were shown to our table right away by a friendly hostess. This Keg location doesn't have a lot of windows or natural light, so its very cozy and dim and very relaxing. I'm normally a creature of habit at the Keg, getting the blue cheese filet with a twice baked potato. But the table beside us was finishing up a rack or ribs that looked really good, so I decided to give them a whirl. I ordered the ribs and chicken with fries and my friend ordered a New York steak medium well with garlic mashed potatoes. 

We didn't have to wait too long for our food and munched on some of the yummy fresh sourdough bread they brought over. I love ribs and will get them whenever possible; I had no idea what to expect when it came to the Keg's version and they didn't disappoint. A nice tasty barbeque sauce on the ribs, not too sauced up, and same with the chicken. The ribs slid right off the bone and were nice and tender. There was a dipping sauce for the chicken that had a TON of flavor and really added to it. The fries were good, but nothing overly special about them (still tasty!). All in, my plate was pretty darn good. I'm not sure I'd get it again, and here's why:

I tried a piece of the New York Steak my friend ordered and it was over. Probably the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. Super flavorful, great steak spice and perfectly cooked. Add in those garlic mashed potatoes (yes, he was kind enough to share some of those too) and I was in steakhouse heaven! I'm salivating just thinking about it (and already planning another visit to have a full sized NY Steak just for myself.

We had multiple servers although I really can't remember the second one coming over more than once during the meal. Service was appropriately attentive but not pushy and the servers sort of maneuvered around you so as not to disturb your meal or conversation. Overall, great food, good service, will be back for sure in the future."}
{"text":"I would put it at 3.5 out of 5. It is sort of on my way home from work, so it is a great option for after work dinner with colleagues who like it. It is just what you would expect from every chain restaurant, generous portions, very standardized menu. It does a good job, but I just can't justify a 4."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Keg location. The service is always friendly and on point. It's a nice large location so plenty of tables, beautiful patio on nice days. Great wine selection by the glass in various size options. The steak is always cooked perfectly to my request. The seasonal specials are reasonably priced.

I have found since being diagnosed Celiac that eating out is challenging. Often I don't quite trust the care in a kitchen to not cross contaminate plus going through the Q&A with the serving staff can be exhausting and a little embarrassing sometimes. This Keg location takes that away for me and makes eating out easy again. When they greet us at the door, I simply have to ask for their Gluten-free menu. They seat me and a floor manager comes with the menu and they ask if it is allergy or preference. When told it is Celiac, they explain potential cross contamination points (fries fried in same fryer as calamari). The meal is even delivered separately from my dining companions and I'm always asked if it is ok for bread to be on the table for my gluten-eating friends.  I have never gotten ill from eating here and I continue to frequent as my \"go-to\" for a night out with the girls.

I also love the sheer number of dishes still available to me on their menu with a few small tweaks.  So, thank you Keg Esplanade!!!"}
{"text":"Found the seating cramped and the noise level high. The service and the food were very good."}
{"text":"The Keg is always good. I really liked this location, especially the lounge area. Attentive staff and a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location. It's a short walk to the Sony Centre so we came here. It was a bonus that we were able to make reservations as well. Some Keg locations won't allow reservations. This one is located right across the street from the Novotel also. 

The decor is nice as per most Kegs that I've been to. I think this one was updated recently as everything looks new. I ordered the beef sliders with fries & hubby had the burger which came with a side of coleslaw & side of fries. Everything was delicious. That's why I like The Keg. I've never had a bad meal at a Keg restaurant. Also the waitstaff are top notch. The host & the front desk was saying some strange remarks to us. But other than that I'd come back here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of the Best Keg Restaurants, always a great service and an awesome steak! Done to perfection! Very recommended place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice, service is proper but slow.  
Food is just ok, steak is so-so, fries are over fried, dry and hard.  
My twice baked potato taste better than the steak.  A little disappointed. 
Sauce for the scallop and bacon doesn't match, I enjoy it on its own."}
{"text":"Bravo Keg Bravo. 

First of all, food and ambience are amazing - everything you'd expect from The Keg. The Peppercorn Steak and Baseball Sirloin are always stellar choices. 

I really wanted to write this review to talk about the service. When you are first seated, the wait staff ask you what the special occasion is. I thought they were just making small talk, but we told them it was for our anniversary. Everything was normal up until the end of the meal. Unbeknownst to us, we were presented with a handwritten card and a slice of Billy Miner's Pie by the manager... I'm sold. You've got me hooked Keg. This gesture has guaranteed a loyal customer for special occasions. You win. Looking forward to celebrating more milestones here."}
{"text":"Fabulous amount of beef done right, service, ambiance, and not to forget...superb wine selection and beverage."}
{"text":"So they say a mistake is all about the recovery so I'm starting this out with a comment about the amazing service. Our delicious scallop app came out with a hair in the plate and the manager immediately came to tell us that he would not charge us for it. When our mains were delivered, my filet leaked all over my husbands beige shorts and again, the manager immediately came over and said he decided to cover our entire dinner. Wonderful service. Now to the excellent food... Everything from start to finish was amazing. Go for the filet 3 way -- filet medallions cooked to perfection with three dipping sauces. My husband ordered the almond crusted salmon which was also delicious. So aside from the slightly rocky start that was fully recovered and had nothing to do with the actual taste of the meals, the food was fantastic and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing that prevented it from getting a full score was the wait time. I had to wait 2 hours to get a table. But the food was well worth the wait. It was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Nice meal . Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Had the NY strip classic and a few drinks. Everything was top notch and reasonably priced for a steak house of this caliber."}
{"text":"Been here several times and the service, steaks, appetizers, fish are really good. Great service, huge wine selection, clean bathrooms, nice ambiance either for business or pleasure. Will definitely come back here anytime."}
{"text":"Perfect location in the downtown Toronto area. I stayed at the hotel across the street and it was perfect to just walk. There is limited street parking but there is a lot a block down. They serve food until 12am which was awesome because I went to a late concert. The customer service was just awesome. They have a special everyday on items. I went here twice during my vacation. The kids menu was nice and inexpensive along with there regular menu. They have outdoor seating and bar area. They have a lounge, bar and dinning room. This restaurant can be for a romantic dinner or just to hang with the girls. I'm still amazed by the prices of the menu, awesome price points for good food. The alcohol was expensive if it was not on a special. I really would love to eat here for the 3rd time."}
{"text":"Two nights in a row, because we had such a great experience the first night. 

Service was top notch, tasty and tender filet mignon and perfectly cooked vegetables. Especially appreciated the care shown to one of us due to gluten intolerance. Do not miss the horseradish... it's off-the-hook good!"}
{"text":"My bestfriend and I love this particular The Keg location. The ambience, the service, the food are top-notch. We always go here to celebrate our birthdays and every single visit for the past 4 birthdays, we got a complimentary birthday cake (and a card) personally delivered to our table by the manager. A very thoughtful gesture, which is one of the reasons why we keep coming back to this location. Highly recommend this location!"}
