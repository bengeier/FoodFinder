{"text":"The guy was really nice. He introduced us to cheese and honey. He used the same pitcher that my mom got me for some special day. In this way - we connected. Bless this man and his Greek yoghurt, which is YOG - HURT."}
{"text":"My wife went to get take out at this establishment tonight. We didn't order anything fancy or complicated to make. After waiting in the restaurant for more than 30 minutes for our food (2 falafels), we ate them immediately because we were so hungry. They were not even warm, they were cold. The lamb was so chewy it was nearly impossible to eat. Cold, chewy lamb is not what I had in mind. There are lots of great restaurants in the city now. If you can't nail down some Greek food standards, and serve food hot, people will choose to go somewhere else. I know I will."}
{"text":"Great Greek food deli that adds to the character of Lo-La (Lower Lawrenceville)!  I have been to Pastitsio ever since it newly opened and have enjoyed coming here ever since.  It's a tiny little deli with spare indoor seating and outdoor seating on an adjacent patio.  The place is bright and decor is streamlined and clean.  

The lamb souvlakia dish is an excellent standout and my personal favorite whenever I stop by for lunch.  The lamb is locally sourced and tender, the rice pilaf is flavorful and deliciously textured with mixed grains.  The tzatziki sauce is light, refreshing and creamy and perfectly complements the meat.  The side salad is served with a fantastic homemade Greek dressing made with high quality olive oil.  The pastitsio and moussaka are delicious and I love the spanakopita and baklava.  

Chef Matt is super friendly and really cares about his food and ingredients. While I was in there talking to him one day, he brought it up that he caters as well (duh, it's on his website but I didn't think to look there) and I decided to have him cater my son's birthday party.  I couldn't have picked a friendlier and more helpful catering service to do this.  Matt went the extra mile to help me pick out dishes and set up the food for the party and offered all this at a reasonable price.  Our guests raved about the food.  The hummus, salad and pita appetizers were delicious and all our guests wanted to take pastitsio, soutsoukakia and baklava home with them!

I'm not sure why this place has gotten negative reviews.  It is, after all, a deli trying to serve home-cooked good food at restaurant quality levels so being critical of the service when there are only one or two people working the place is slightly unfair.   I'll definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek cuisine, outstanding service, convenient location.  Stuffed grape leaves the best I have tasted.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, freshly made from local sources. We ate moussaka, lamb gyro and baklava.  We'll be returning."}
{"text":"I was passing by on my way to Coca, but decided to stop in here instead as it was empty.  I was taking out for lunch.  The ambiance was typical of a deli.  A counter, two refrigerated cases, one with the drinks, the other with sides, and a couple of tables.  

I ordered the falafel sandwich, a side of hummus, and baklava.  I am very picky about falafel, and this was amazing! She made it right on the spot.  I was perfectly moist and flavorful, and it was flattened out to fit in the sandwich, which made it much easier to eat.  The pita was soft and thick.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  It came with a side salad which was an average side salad.  Romaine with some chopped veggies and vinaigrette, nothing to rave about.  The hummus was okay.  It was a little dry, but the flavor was good.  The baklava was delicious.  It was a nice, large piece.  The top was flaky and the bottom sweet and moist.  The nuts were not too large but not difficult to distinguish.

Overall, it was very good and I am definitely planning on returning."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. The entire restaurant was filled with smoke from our burnt food that we were then served. The service was terrible. A party of two that came in 30 minutes after our party of two received their food before we did and our food took forever to come out. 

Water was hardly ever refilled and they were out of 3-4 items on the menu.  Why are they on the menu if you are out of them? 

There were at least 3 people working for only 4 tables. I don't understand how the service was so bad. Also, a couple came in and had a reservation and the waitress who had no clue what was happening told them they could wait for the next table.  They ended up leaving after waiting for 30 minutes past their reservation. 

Greek Stop in Glenshaw is far better service and food and is worth the 20 minute drive. 

I will not go back to Pastitsio"}
{"text":"This was an absolutely wonderful experience. We went about a week or two ago, and the service was great, the food was excellent, and the atmosphere delightful. If you can, try the pastitsio or the moussaka. We also LOVED the olive and cheese plate.

Again, just wow."}
{"text":"Yummy and authentic greek food. The gyros are delicious.  The service was excellent. Plus byob!"}
{"text":"Genuinely some of the best Greek food I've ever had. I've been several times and had the owner himself make and serve our food. Perfect portions, fresh ingredients, lovely outdoor seating area. One of my favorite places to eat in the city!!"}
{"text":"I had the best time at Patitsio on friday evening. We had invited 18 of our closest friends to celebrate my dad's new book. It was really cool to sit outdoors under the stars and the food that was prepared by Chef Matt was just wonderful! The appetizers, Patitsio, Chicken skewers, and Spanikopita was delicious.  The salad was fresh and the dressing that went with was very tasty. The seasame cookies and special grape dessert from Alex was amazing as well! I will definitely be recommending Patitsio to my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Came here on a quiet Saturday evening with family in town, restaurant is small with only 6 tables. But what it lacks in size it delivers in punch.
Very authentic greek food (and I've eaten A LOT of greek), with incredibly fresh ingredients.
You can tell the chef puts love in his culinary endeavors.
The BYOB is helpful as well! (no corking fee). Our waitress did a good job. No complaints about service, and the greek music is a lovely ambience.
The soup was delicious and very flavorful, and the lamb pitas were some of the best I've ever had. Don't skip the Baklava or Greek Yogurt, Walnuts and Honey desserts either - they're worth it.

Will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"The close sign was on, and we didn't see anyone inside, so we thought it was closed for the evening until we saw someone else went in.... Only the chef was there, so it took a long time for him to prepare our food. He was nice, but I don't think the food was worth the wait. 5-10 minutes for the water to come. 15-20 minutes later we got our free snack due to the Yelp checkin. And after another 20-30 minutes we got our entrees and salads. 

I absolutely loved their salad. The falafel was great: it was moister than what I used to have. I got the Pastitsio. I've never had it before, so I cannot compare it with others. It was okay. My friend got the Grilled Lamb which was just so-so in his opinion. For the price, I was expecting bigger portion.

The outdoor seating was nice."}
{"text":"Another great Lawrenceville spot.

This is a very nice, small greek café with a cute little enclosed patio. The owner has been rocking this spot for nearly 10 years. Hard to miss if you're in the neighborhood and want to have some really good Mediterranean food al fresco. 

My partner and I were lucky enough to have been part of a small, intimate Yelp event here, where nearly everything on the menu was showcased for us. The owner explained almost every dish, talked to all of us and served us up some really great food. 
First, we had a sampler plate of the appetizers: spanakopita, falafel, dolmathes (my fav), eggplant puree, and hummus. Everything was really great, I even tried the eggplant puree (not babaganoush) and I don't even like eggplant. Next we had this twist on a salad - it was tomatoes, red onion, feta and kalamata olives on a hard barley bread called a \"rusk\". This reminded me a lot of taboule, but the grain being a hard bread that softened in the tomato and olive juices. Crunchy bites, mixed with feta and tomato - it was really nice.
We had shrimp and feta over linguine for an entrée. Luckily, I can never get enough feta cheese. Nice plump shrimp mixed with feta with a light tomato sauce - more cheese than sauce, so think lighter than traditional Italian style sauces. This would be great to eat on the patio in the summer. 
If you go to Pastitsio and you order nothing else - order the greek yogurt. They make this stuff in house, strain it and remove the whey which makes a very creamy and stiff yogurt. This was amazing, almost like a soft serve ice cream with a very slight vanilla flavor, covered with pretzel pieces and strawberries. The owner said it really holds up in the summer months, cool and refreshing. Gimme a glass of water and a serving of this on a hot summer day, man! Too cool for school. It was the perfect desert to top off our little culinary tour of what this place has to offer. 
Go there - tell em your cousin Benny sent ya."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a falafel sandwich and a greek yogurt with honey. They both tasted decent enough and people were nice, but it took FOREVER to get us our quick food. We were the only customers and it took half hour to get us our food! I would probably go again if they were faster, but I can't afford such a long lunch break. Probably a place to check out for the food, just be prepared in case you have a long wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with quality fresh ingredients.  Pastitsio caters for our office and everyone loves the pitas, spanakopita and orzo salad.  It is an amazing place!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 - Pastitsio:  A delightful dish full of flavor and smooth bechamel sauce
2.0/5 - Gyro: very small portions, lacking in flavor
3.5/5 - Lamb Dinner: delicoius, but small"}
{"text":"This was the most delicious restaurant food that I have had in a while.  It is apparent that every morsel is hand made with skill, knowledge and care.  The falafel sandwich was the best I have tasted since I visited Greece.  The chef/ owner came in straight from the Lawrenceville Farmer's Market while we were there for lunch.  The freshness of the produce shows in the incredible favors.  They make their own yogurt in house!  I can't wait to go back with a group and sit on the patio with some growlers of beer from East End Brewing and enjoy this delicious food again."}
{"text":"This was my first meal from Pastitsio's and it was AMAZING!!
I had a pork gyro and a greek salad.  Without a doubt they were the freshest ingredients and the flavor was incredible! TOP NOTCH!  I would suggest everyone try Pastitsio's!"}
{"text":"Great food! They ran out of what I wanted but the dish I did get was amazing (chicken with rice). This is a hidden gem. The food does take awhile so if your in a rush...I would get pick up. It's nice to find a new place. Very healthy and had Gluten Free Items (which I need). Bravo!"}
{"text":"The gyro here is pretty tasty.  The ingredients are fresh (and local) and the flavors are good.  Each component is very tasty on its own: the warm soft pita, nicely seasoned lamb, yummy tzatziki, and fresh veggies.  It was all very good, but didn't knock my socks off when assembled together--still tasty though.  I plan to come back and get another gyro or try out the falafel.  $10 minimum on credit/debit card purchases kind of stinks, but I understand why businesses do it."}
{"text":"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dining at this restaurant.  From the beginning to the end it was extremely disappointing.  I emailed the restaurant to make a reservation at 7.  When my group showed up they had no idea what I was talking about, even though I had received a return email confirming my reservation.  The place was empty inside so we still got a table without a problem.  It took over 20 minutes for them to get us water for the table and over 30 minutes for us to order.  The food we ordered was extremely simple - 2 salads and 2 gyros.  How that order took well over an hour to serve us still blows my mind. When we did get an appetizer they forgot to serve the break with it.  They never once came to get us refills, to the point where we had to walk in the kitchen and ask; even then it took another 10 minutes to get a glass of water.  When the food finally came we were even more disappointed.  The food was exceedingly average at best.  The worst part was one of us ordered the gyro plain with no sauce.  Not surprisingly they put sauce on it but had to audacity to scrape it off and still serve it to us.  Unbelievable, it came out with remnants of sauce and who knows what on the pita bread.  We immediately sent it back and received attitude from the server when we did.  After having to ask for a box and the bill and waiting another 20 minutes we were finally out of that awful experience.  The service was terrible and the food was extremely average at best.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype.  I stopped in tonight when my Greek/pita/hunger craving set in earlier.  I yelped the word \"Greek\" and this spot came up as número uno.  I noted yelp gave it darn close to 5 stars with plenty of reviews.  ordered the grilled chicken gyro nice clean eats with bites of cucumber, grilled chick, toms, tzatziki sauce, pita bread no mess.  Under $8.  Be back soon to try hummus to go..."}
{"text":"Excellent! I ordered take out of chicken souvlaki and asked for a horiatiki salata (no lettuce).  The salad that came with it already was also very good (included lettuce, carrots and olives) but I was glad to also have the true horiatiki). Really nice souvlaki which included juicy char grilled chicken breast, onion, green pepper, repeat on a simple bed of lemon rice. Also perfect tzatziki! This place is also super cute and pristinely clean with real little flower vases on each table. Will be back for sure and this time to dine in."}
{"text":"Came here last week for dinner.  My date and I both wanted lamb dishes but they were out, so she got the chicken gyro, and I had the chicken souvlakia instead.  

The gyro received praise.  I thought my chicken was decent, and the salad & dressing were fresh... however the rice tasted off to me, like it'd been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit of a disappointment since our server had recommended it mixed with tsaziki sauce.  Speaking of whom, our server was very sweet, attentive, and didn't rush us after we'd finished eating (even when the place got full).

I will probably give Pastitsio another chance; it's close to work, and I'd also like to check out the homemade hummus & pita that another reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"Love it here, eat those Pastitsios all the time!  You should too.

Actually I move often enjoy a salad, gyros get my hand's dirty.

Eat in or take out.  Good food takes time, so plan for that.  What ever is on special is for sure special, so have some of that too!"}
{"text":"Clean - unassuming - great comfort food- friendly cheerful servers 

Highly recommended. 
No liquor licence though so BYOO - bring your own ouzo."}
{"text":"FAN-TASTIC.   I got a gyro.  Served with a salad.  Nothing pedestrian about this place, I loved my food.  I got some stuffed grape leaves, about half a pound.  Nothing special about them, not the worst not the best.  The gyro and salad/dressing was awesome.  The better half got the lamb special.  We watched the owner grill it up for us, outside.  he said it was excellent.   this place is going to become a staple in my Lawrenceville food choices."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive, not that much food for the price. The quality was decent, but nothing too elaborate, and the vibrant flavors you'd expect from Greek food just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't get 5 stars every time. I love it. Absolutely love it. 
The food is simply put: amazing. Every time I think about the Chicken Hellenica dish, my mouth immediately starts watering. I have tried nearly every dish on their menu, as well as the specials. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The service is really good too. Crystal and the owner, Matt, are very attentive and friendly. 

I highly recommend the specials whenever they are on the board. Their falafel sandwich is great, and make sure you try all the salads, from the house to the beet to the wheat salad. 

The one tiny downside to this place is the inside decor. I don't like the aluminum-ish tables and would prefer nice wooden ones, but I understand that the place was made for take-out. They have some nice pictures up and a beautiful wooden bench on the side, which I sit on whenever I am taking food home with me. While the inside might do with a little added warmth, the out-door patio is pretty sweet to lounge and enjoy all the great food."}
{"text":"We brought the grandparents here tonight to take them out for a special evening.  It was an embarrassment.  When we were seated outside, we were the only people in the establishment.  Shortly thereafter, two more gentlemen arrived and our server asked for our menus because he said he didn't have enough.  That was a little strange.  He took our drink and appetizer order and didn't come back for 15 to 20 minutes.  We had to ask for my husband's drink three times. It began pouring and we had to bring our drinks and appetizers inside.  Our spanikopita sat within viewing range for 10 minutes before the waiter delivered it separately, after being cued by my father-in-law.  An half of an hour later, we finally had the opportunity to place our order.  During the next 30 minutes, we sat with dirty plates on our tables, hoping he would come back so we could order drink refills.  At one hour in, my husband finally got the server and asked him how much longer we would have to wait.  He said five minutes.  We were about to walk out when the food finally arrived. The food was ok, just ok and over priced. My son's chicken, which was a small portion over rice, cost $18.  My soup was amazingly flavorful, the one caveat to a terrible dining experience.   No apology from the waiter.  No explanation.  No offer to pay for drinks or comp anything.  I felt very bad for the second table of gentlemen.  They had to wait even longer than us, and at about 45 minutes in, the server informed them that they had run out of lamb.  We are never going back.  There are too many amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Hmmm, well we were the only two people in there.. and the food took 25 minutes. For a gyro and a veggie pita??? After that, it wasn't anything all that good :( Meh, probably not going to go back."}
{"text":"I order takeout from Pastitsio regularly and my family loves it. I recommend the pastitsio, falafel salad, beet salad, and grape leaves. I also recommend their baklava, which I consider some of the best in Pittsburgh, but the reason I like it is that it's not as sweet as others make it -- so your mileage may vary. Their moussaka is also good, but we rarely choose that over the pastitsio.

The staff is really nice and laid-back. The portions are not giant Pittsburgh portions, but they're appropriate and I think the price is totally right for the quality and freshness of the food."}
{"text":"Great little Greek deli and something new and interesting in Lawrenceville. The owner's a nice guy and easy to talk to as well.

I've had their baklava and it was absolutely divine. I have yet to try the rice pudding but I plan on it.

On my first trip I had moussaka. It was like lasagna and was delicious. The side salad is nothing to write home about but the oil dressing was perfect and had that light, handmade touch that makes real dressing so much better than the bottled stuff.

On a second trip it was insanely busy due to their recent Groupon involvement. The service was slow but I had the feeling they simply weren't use to the amount of people coming in. Either way, my lamb gyro was delicious and the pita, as others have said, is perfect. Served warm and fluffy with a bit of crispiness on the outside.

Definitely give this place a try. It's an interesting place to dine because Stamatis changes the menu so often and uses high quality, local ingredients.

{"text":"One of the most underrated placed in the Pittsburgh area. This food is very traditional home cooking and very very good. It's also BYOB which is amazing. I would highly suggest a visit. I truly would recommend anything on the menu, always get FETA. Sit outside in the warm weather and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a good dinner with friends here.  Definitely Americanized versions of Greek dishes, but any changes they made to traditional recipes still tasted really good.  Also excellent for bringing home a dish for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"No pretense- just good food and great prices! Outdoor patio for warm weather. Service a little slow (they were working on a big catering order I think) and Baklava wasn't anything to write home about...but other than that definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty new to Greek food but wow, I've definitely been converted!!

I ordered the Moussaka, which I promptly gobbled up. I probably looked like a starving child but I didn't care - it was that good! The entrée also came with a side of Greek salad which was great because I do like getting in my greens. I will say that the portions were not super big, maybe because it was lunch? Either way it didn't bother me too much, and I'll definitely be coming back.

Till next time Pastitsio!"}
{"text":"Everything here seems to be made in-house. Very fresh ingredients. The falafel was excellent. The hummus came with pretzels and was a little dry, but still good. It's a small place so try slightly off hours."}
{"text":"A delightful lunch today!  Best falafel in town. Great texture with delicate flavors. The grape leaves on the salad were incredible ... definitely having those next time. Great menu, very simple. Good prices and quantity. Trying a dinner next time. Only negative on our salad was that it was sort of diner quality recipe/ingredients: good quality, but not a particularly \"chef-ed\" plate."}
{"text":"Good homestyle Greek food with a nice outdoor seating area. There is seating indoors too for when it gets too cold. The dinner portions are huge, enough for two people (or for you to box the other half and eat it later!) They were out of the moussaka so I was disappointed, but the pastitsio was still good. Like a Greek baked ziti"}
{"text":"Solid Greek food in the heart of Lawrenceville.  The falafel was tasty, the service was quick, the environment was cozy.  This place closes sorta early-ish so I'd think of it more of a lunch or carry out place than a true dine-in establishment.  Though I certainly did enjoy my cafe experience.  Enough options to satisfy the Greek connoisseur, but simple enough to appeal to the dumbos like myself.  The falafel sandwich was absolutely fantastic.  The hummus had a nice zing to it, which was appreciated.  Portion sizes were plenty.  Some of the entrees cost a bit more than what you'd expect to pay (paying in the teens for some dishes), but as long as you stick to the simple sandwiches, you'll certainly receive a fair value."}
{"text":"Spanikopita was great...nice and flaky, fresh cheese and spinach..yummo!  Got the lamb....the salad and dressing were GREAT...the lamb was room temperature with too much fat for my liking.  The tabouli was good and my hubbys gyro was really good...also not hot but warmer than mine.  The brewed iced tea and fresh lemonade hit the spot.  We left feeling good...not hungry, but not exactly full either.  All in all a good experience but probably won't go out of my way to get a $25 lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere - spanikopita was amazing! Definitely will come back again next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This place is great. Small, original, true to its roots. Everything was simple and tasty. This is exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Great chicken souvlaki and Greek pasta. Try it! We walkin in and were plea toy surprised w the excellent Greek food"}
{"text":"Had family in from out of town for a visit, and they were in the mood for Greek food, so off to Pastitsio we went...
We were a little nervous after the appetizers (excellent spanakopita, but mediocre saganaki, and flavorless hummus)...
But then the entrees showed up...
Lamb Souvlakia was utterly beautiful, 2 skewers of perfectly rare and perfectly seasoned lamb, with onions and peppers, served with perfect rice....trust me, ask for some tzatziki with it,,,you'll thank me for it.
Oh, and it's BYOB, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Good food but it was also overpriced by about $4 (cost $7-it was tiny) and took 20 minutes too long.  I ordered falafel, she told me they needed to make it so it was going to be about 20 minutes; I opted for the other choice...still took 20 minutes.  It was 2p.m. on a Saturday, they open at 11a.m. I'll give it another shot because this place is in my neighborhood.  Like I said great food-but charge what it's worth and have it together at 2p.m on a Saturday, people!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Awesome greek food, using fresh, local ingredients (you can taste the quality), with fantastic service (the two women at the counter were really lovely). When I first saw the prices, I balked a little thinking them pretty high for what I assumed was just a run-of-the-mill takeout gyro shop. Boy was I wrong! This is not your everyday takeout fare and the menu goes far beyond the standard takeout greek. Greek yogurt made fresh in-house with grilled pomegranate? Yes, please. I assume they mostly do a takeout business because the seating area is pretty small but it was actually quite nice and, from the looks of it, they have a BYOB policy (very cool). Definitely try this place. I recommend the house salad with lamb (this is not your ordinary house salad...there are amazing roasted vegetables and dolmas on top and the dressing is delicious and light). My boyfriend had the chicken gyro and was still talking about how yummy it was the next morning."}
{"text":"A neat lunch place in Lawrenceville. 
There are only 2,3 tables, and most people have meals to go. 
The staffs are most friendly and really know how to cook their food right! 
Try their Pastitsio."}
{"text":"pastitsio is a great addition to the growing ethnic food selection on butler street. 

stopped in for an early weeknight dinner and had the seating area to ourselves. while the interior is a bit cold (temperature wise) and didn't have a ton of character, the food was good enough to earn 4 stars. 

i got the pastitsio which was very good, and was served with a great side salad. i saw you can also get dishes to-go for about half the dinner prices which are a great value for what you get. 

the food may not have been as good as pylos in nyc, but you could tell a lot of care was put into the menu, and everything really had that homemade quality."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful and delicious experience. Falafel and palakari will blow your mind. Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I went in for the falafel.  It was definitely a different kind of falafel.  While I do still prefer the green Middle Easter falafel, this place was nice.  I could tell that it was all homemade and freshly prepared.  It was delicious and decently priced.  I can only imagine that the rest of the menu is unique and fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I finally got around to eating here the other night. I've been wanting to try Pastitsio's for a while now. I was highly disappointed! First off the menu is VERY small & they only have a couple vegetarian choices. The portions of food are very small & it's a little pricey for the amount of food they give you. My husband & I eached ordered a falafel sandwich & split an appetizer & we both left still hungry. 
The falafel sandwich came with a very tiny side sale that was actually really good, the salad dressing was the best part of the whole meal. I was not a fan of the falafels. They did not have a crispy outer shell like every falafel I've eaten. They were really mushy. 
Also, it was kind of weird that the appetizer that we ordered came out after our entree. We got the entree first & the appetizer came out about half way through our meal. 
On the up side service was good. Our waitress was very nice. 
However I most likely will not be back. The quality is not bad it just wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"Randomly picked this place while picking somebody up from the train station. Was a pleasant surprise with a family touch. FOOD WAS AMAZING. We had the falafel, grilled shrimp, musaka and pastitsio. All of the dishes came with a side salad with yummy and light dressing. All was very fresh and homemade tasting. Services was nice and very personable. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. I have a slight bias towards small businesses that locally source and, above all, are DELICIOUS.

Google Offers sent me here with a deal too good to pass up. T'was criminal, really, that I hadn't been to Pastitsio before since I only live up the hill from it. I seem to always stop by when they're closed! (That being said, they do have slightly strange hours.) I stopped reading the menu as soon as I got to FALAFEL SANDWICH and, pupils dilated, saliva dripping, just repeatedly pointed at the words until I received my sandwich. While the ten minute wait for my sandwich might very well have been the longest ten minutes of my life, every bite was sooooo sooo worth it. Everything was just amazingly fresh! From the cucumber and carrot salad to the veggies in the sandwich, it seriously tasted like they just uprooted their produce in the back upon receiving my order. The best part, however, was the falafel itself. It was certainly unconventional in that it tasted much richer and more moist than falafel I've had elsewhere. If only I could replicate everything in my own kitchen! Alas, I'm forced to return again and again on an empty stomach (though leaving fully satiated).

I really thought I had had the best falafel in town at Kassab's, but Pastitsio seriously gives them a run for their money! Now, I just need to get them to deliver lunch to my workplace... (and cater my birthday... and maybe my wedding... and my bat mitzvah...)"}
{"text":"Worst Greek ever. Rice wasnt cooked in the grape leaves which were swimming in grease 

The falafel breaks apart and is nothing like I've ever had in my entire life.

Skip this joint"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to the Pgh Vintage Mixer this afternoon, we were having a girls date out! 

We were trying to decide where to eat an early dinner in Lawrenceville. I've been eyeing up Pastitsio for a few weeks. They follow me on Instagram via my twistburgh account, so I definitely wanted to check them out! 

The restaurant is small, but very cozy. Our waitress was so friendly. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. 

To start, we order the Saganaki (Pan fried kafalograviera cheese and finished with a savory brandy. Vegetarian and gluten free) it was delicious! Heads up, if you check in on Yelp  - you get a free order of Spanakopita (2 squares of crispy sheets of phyllo layered with spinach, herbs and feta. Vegetarian.) The spanakopita is to die for! They also gave use grilled pita that tasted amazing 
.

For our entrees, I ordered the Chicken Souvlakia
(Marinated chicken with garlic, olive oil and lemon, severed over basmati rice. Come with sides salad. Gluten free.) You can either order the lunch or dinner portion in the afternoon. My mom ordered the Lamb Souvlakia (Marinated leg of lamb with garlic, olive oil and lemon and severed over basmati rice. Come with sides salad. Gluten free) - these entrees were amazing. It was the perfect amount of food for an early afternoon dinner. The lamb and chicken were cooked perfectly. The rice was delicious as well. The side salads were wonderful. It was literally the freshest salad I've ever had. 

For dessert, we ordered baklava to go. I can't wait to try them later. 

This place is BYOB, so I'll definitely be back with a great bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"Service: the staff is nice, but management needs to hire more people per shift. A solo lunch took 1.5 hours, end to end. This has happened almost each time I've been here. 

Food: Ordered the chicken skewer and it was undernourishing. They have another, but even with both the amount of food was small. The rice was bland and overcooked."}
{"text":"I am pretty torn while writing this review. This review is solely based on a to-go order I placed over the weekend. I cannot speak to a sit down dining experience at this point. First things first, if you have a large party this is not the place for you. I noticed two 4 top tables and three 2 top tables inside. They do have a patio which is great during the warm summer months, but not so much of an option during winter. I was the only person in the restaurant at the time I placed my order and it took probably 15 minutes for it to be ready. I only saw the owner and one other person in the kitchen. This is the true definition of a mom and pop shop that offers fresh and local ingredients in each of their dishes. 

I ordered a gyro to-go and that is usually my go to at Greek restaurants. I was surprised to find out that a side salad comes with the pitas. The salad was fresh and I probably could have crushed a whole bowl of it. I had pretty high expectations for the gyro after eating that delicious salad. First, I noted that the gyro meat was nice and thick without overwhelming the pita. After my first bite I immediately thought something was slightly over seasoned with dill. I'm not sure if it was the gyro meat or the tzatziki sauce, but something in the pita was seasoned a little too much. Unfortunately, Pastitsio will not be my first choice when I'm craving a gyro."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price! Stopped by last Saturday and sat on the outdoor patio. I always appreciate a good BYOB restaurant. The hummus and pita was complimentary. We also ordered the spanakopita appetizer -- was flaky and delicious. My wife ordered the chicken pita and I had the pastitsio -- would recommend both! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here. The prices are great and it is also a BYOB. They have a nice patio for outdoor seating as well as some indoor seating. I've gotten take-out and dined in here and every experience has been great. 

What really stood out to me was the friendliness and courtesy I was shown by all of the employees. That alone is enough to get me to come back. Add in delicious gyros, salads, rice pilaf, and I can't resist!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best Greek food in Pittsburgh. I went here for the first time with my friend from New York City and she even said that it was the best Greek food that she has ever eaten. Since this first visit, I have been stopping in for takeout to store in my fridge. The staff is very nice and the owner will actually take the time to chat with you. It is obvious that I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were set on Coca but the line was too long. We saw the open sign here and decided to give it a try. After a few bites, we were glad Coca had been too full.

We had the falafel sandwich ($6), grilled veggie sandwich ($6), zucchini soup ($3.50) and some dolmas ($2). The dolmas we just grabbed out of the fridge and were not too exciting, but if you find most dolmas too slimy you'll like that these are dry. Also quite small and high ratio of leave to contents. Then the soup came out and was delicious. Simple balanced flavors.

But the sandwiches are why I'm taking the time to write a review. The pita was thick and spongy. The falafel was the lightest and fluffiest I've ever had. They mash it in the sandwich so it's shaped more like a panini than the Noah's ark style that I usually see. I don't go for simple grilled veggies often, but that sandwich was also great. Not too oily, not too stiff. Finally, the side salad included was so good it would stand on its own. The vegetables were fresh, the olives were as large as the tomatoes and nearly as juicy.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have had in Pittsburgh! At first I was worried because the waiter seemed a bit incompetent, but the chef cooking our food knew what he was doing. We started with the Babaganoush. It was smooth, not too smokey, and seasoned perfectly. They made the Avgolemono Soup fresh for us. It was amazing!! It was hot, creamy from the eggs, tart from the lemon, and delicious. We had chicken and lamb souvlakia for our entrees. The proteins were moist and well seasoned, the salad and its dressing was beautiful, and the rice was ok. The rice was a bit too crisped up for my taste, like it had been left on the stove or in the oven for too long. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try super awesome Greek food and the small restaurant is perfect for a lovely intimate date night!"}
{"text":"I went with great expectation. The lemon soup was like dish water with rice not fully cooked. Uggh...well maybe the chicken slavakino... Ended up so salty it was not edible. Really bummed"}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled onto this restaurant by accident and I'm so glad we did!

We were seated outside immediately upon arrival and our waitress was pouring us waters and opening our bottle of wine within minutes! (It is BYOB!) 

We started out with the hummus appetizer and the saganaki They both had a fresh and homemade taste to them! I highly recommend trying the two together. 

We were served their house salad before our entrees came and they were perfect. The dressing was very authentic! Out of our entire party the highlights of the entrees were the shrimp dish with the basmati rice and the lamb gyro.  

We finished off the meal by splitting the rice pudding and baklava. Again, they were both noticeably homemade and delicious. 

The reason for four stars instead of five was due to the quality given for their price point. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a mini-hangover brunch on a Sunday a little while ago. The breakfast gyro I had was fresh-tasting and super satisfying but also not too filling.  In short - a perfect mildly-hungover brunch option! 

They also generously gave me a free sample of their blueberry bread pudding. I generally don't like blueberries OR bread pudding so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this. The staff and atmosphere were very pleasant and inviting as well."}
{"text":"Great food! Best Greek food this side of Corfu... love the dolmas and mousakka. Only thing that would make this place better is if they served ouzo."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely homemade, except you didn't have to make it! Try the Dakos Salata, Spanakopita to die for, Gyro of the Day, just about anything. We have become regulars here. You cannot beat it. So very good."}
{"text":"Its really difficult to say anything good, but this is it ...... it was February and almost 70 degrees and we were attracted to the patio seating area.  The staff was understaffed (just two men), our waiter/cook/dishwasher did not number the tables and lost our order after 35 minutes he came over to tell us what happened.  Thank God we brought enough wine to get through that, poor dear could not even get us water without being flustered.  We chose not to reorder, as they were out of the many choices we selected.  He apologized and offered to make another dinner for us during the week, we chose not to go back.  I'm judging from the reviews it was definitely an off night for them."}
{"text":"the service is excellent. the food is some of the best Mediterranean food I've had, particularly in Pittsburgh. the falafel salad is light and delicious and the pastistio is perfection."}
{"text":"Went for a first time today. There are definite things to like about the place: it's small, clean, and quiet. Fresh ingredients, nice salad dressing with feta cheese. Unfortunately there are downsides. Portions are rather small for the price. I had falafel which pretty much lacked any flavor, tasted more like sand + cardboard. My partner had a gyro with very thin strips of meat, which he said also lacked flavor. In summary, nothing close to yummy, bursting with flavors, wonderful traditional Greek food."}
{"text":"My first time here ,,
Classic Greek food! Very fresh made to order! Had the lemon potatoes different from what I'm used to but were good!!  Also had the grape leaves and gyro! Both were very good as well!!"}
{"text":"Very light and healthy food.  Tasty too.
Very clean kitchen / dining area.  If you like Greek food or are in the area, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Its a small family run place and the Chef and Waitress could not be nicer.  The restaurant filled up when we got there and it took a really long time to get our food.  Also, the place filled up with smoke I am guessing because its small and the vent fan must not work well.  The food is definitely fresh and made to order but just OK.  I will go back and give it another shot because I really want to love this place but not there yet."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was SO SO SO BAD. Completely ruined my experience. Was wondering why it was dead on a Friday night and now I know why. I would give zero stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"I tried to find out what to write about this place but all I can say was it was a little bit of a disappointment.  The service was really kind but I was still not blown away by the food.  

We chose to sit inside because first off I hate the thought of insects infesting my food and also I love my air conditioning too much.  At first I thought it was nice that the kitchen was open and you could see your food being prepared. Then the smoke came and clouded the whole restaurant. 

Then the food came...or should I say the kids meal came. The portion was barely enough to feed a 12 year old. However - the food here was good! I just wish I had more. The falafel was soft and the salad was pretty good but I wanted more than a few bites. I guess it's a good strategy - make them want more!"}
{"text":"So...

I went when Pastitsio first opened and was a little disappointed. There weren't many options, the portions were small and pricey and my bf and I were just \"meh\" about it. I haven't been back since that visit until today....

All I have to say is that I am disappointed in MYSELF that I didn't return to this place sooner! It is super close to my house, and I had no idea I could have access to fresh, DELISH hummus all the time. Hummus is a food group for me, and being a vegetarian, it is one of the only things I can order at a lot of restaurants/bars besides salad. So I love it, I never get sick of it. Pastitsio's does it FRESH and RIGHT! It is so good paired with their warm pita! You can also buy containers to go, and now that I know this, I will probably be back frequently!

They also have an array of fresh (vegan/veggie) salads like Tabboulah and potato salad with olive oil, not mayo. They have daily specials (bf got the carved chicken sandwich) and many other fun things in their to-go fridge. BF loved the salad dressing as well!

Plus, they were so friendly when we walked in! Super nice people, they brought everything to our table on nice plates, and just made the extra effort. Can't wait to be back for my weekly hummus fill!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to try this place, considering I live fairly close to it. My boyfriend and I ordered takeout one night when we didn't feel like cooking. We were not disappointed. At first my boyfriend was a little disappointed in the serving size (because we are hungry Americans), but after his first bite he loved it. He ordered some chicken dinner, and I got the Greek salad with gyro. The Greek dressing was very flavorful, and the salad had loads of colorful veggies. My salad was delicious and I was completely full after I ate it. We also ordered a side of hummus and pita that was yummy, but i wish it came with some veggie sticks along with the pita. I'll for sure order at this place again!"}
{"text":"I was famished and remembered I have a Square coupon for $5 off.  I had a taste for their awesome roasted mixed vegetables with hummus and an order of the spanakopita.  The spanakopita is one of the best I've ever tasted because it's made with fresh not frozen spinach, the phyllo is crisp & flaky. I would have taken a picture of my meal but I was too hungry and forgot. I was the only customer and had the pleasure to get to know the owner, Matt, and his waiter, Greg, better.  Greg is a thoughtful and attentive waiter. Matt gave me great advise on how to make hummus smooth and creamy like his, I also found out he makes whole milk yogurt!"}
{"text":"This is going to be my new regular spot! The food is amazing and the ambiance is great especially if you sit outside..it's BYOB and there is a wine and spirits a couple blocks away. Very convenient."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. Started with the saganaki. Who doesn't like flaming cheese??? Gyro was excellent"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  The place is small, only 6 tables but, there is outdoor seating with umbrellas. We went early enough where we were seated immediately.  The service was great and friendly and we did not wait long for our food.  Ordered apps; Beet salad and Eggplant Baba ganoush both were very tasty especially the Baba ganoush.  For lunch entree we ordered the standard Gyro, and lamb souvlaki.  Both were flavorful and the lamb was cooked perfectly.  What was really delicious was their salad dressing and tzatziki, I could lathered my food in them.
This place is clean, reasonably priced, service is good and food is yummy.  Would definately come back to try something different.  All in all, enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent food and extremely fast service! Definitely coming back! Authentic Greek food that was light and refreshing:"}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant in the heart of Lawrenceville. Everything here is made to order, using the freshest ingredients possible, and the staff is so friendly. The gentleman who owns the restaurant is such a nice guy and so appreciative of each and every customer that walks through his doors. I love coming here for dinner and supporting this restaurant. Everything is made-to-order so expect to wait just a little bit longer but the quality is worth every second of it. Best spanakopita I've had in Pittsburgh, hands-down! I've never had a bad meal here, and the more I eat from the menu the more this restaurant becomes one of my favorite."}
{"text":"There were a lot of things I like about this place:
- clean, open kitchen
- awesome customer service
- fresh ingredients 
- the only grape leaves I've ever liked

However.... The prices/portion sizes are painful! $9 for the smallest falafel salad I've ever seen. $7 for a tiny chicken wrap. The good was good but not good enough to warrant the prices. 

There's better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pastitsio is a lovely and tasty little Greek deli in the heart of Lower Lawrenceville.  The indoor space is very small and makes it look more like a take-out joint, but I love eating on the outdoor patio, which has lovely tables and big umbrellas for shade.

Matt (the owner) and Crystal are both super sweet and take extra care to make sure you have an enjoyable experience eating there.

For the most part, their food is delicious.  They make AMAZING chicken pitas and the salads are always super fresh and on point.

Their ingredients are always fresh and sourced as locally as possible.  Their food is extremely reasonably priced given the quality of the ingredients and the care and love that is obviously put into making it.  You can get a delicious chicken pita -- probably the best I've had in the city -- and a fresh side salad for just $7.  For some dishes, the portions aren't huge (and if they are, you will pay more like $10-15 per dish) but they do have good deals and coupons from time to time.  Definitely try it out if you're looking for lunch in Lawrenceville!  I get takeout from here all the time."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and my love goes back long, long days (This is how my younger cousin used to describe \"A long time ago\")!  Yogurt, hummus, baba ghanouj, pita bread, kebab are some of the first foods that I tasted which weren't soul food influenced besides pizza or Chinese food.  The sharp, often acidic flavors mixed with piquant spices really appeal to me and the food served at Pastistio knocked me out.

Don't go looking for just gyros (which they have) because there is so much more to their menu.  My daughter and I have been to Pastistio previously for their Palakari, which is a mixture of Red Winter Wheat, Black-eyed peas, shallots and Red wine Vinegar, orzo salad and gyro platters.  Delicious!  On our visit for the prix fixe dinner, we had a mezze platter with falafel, pita bread, tzatziki, hummus, roasted eggplant puree, dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves), spanakopita and olives.  Whew!  I feel full and just got tired from listing all of that stuff.  We were also served the Dakos Salata, which is a Greek take on the Italian panzanella bread salad.  Pastistio's is served over a piece of barley rusk which provides a nice nutty counterbalance to the tomatoes, feta cheese and other acidic ingredients.  For our entrée we were served the Shrimp and Feta (Shrimp seasoned and sauteed with a white wine & fresh tomato sauce with angel hair pasta) and for dessert we were served a homemade whole cream yogurt with strawberry & lime spoon sweets.

The owner, Stamatis (Matt) Bournias and his staff provided excellent service and wonderful food!  ! (Fantastic!)   ! (We will be back!)"}
{"text":"Visited restaurant while visiting from Miami. Great Greek food! Awesome service by both the staff as well as the owner-chef. Would visit again and recommend as a great find in Lawrenceville, an up and coming area out of Pittsburg with a Super Cool Vibe! Would highly recommend restaurant. Area and restaurant is a must visit in Pittsburg. Only down side is the bring your own liquor law, which is not the restaurants fault. Pittsburg needs to better support these small business owners showing that American ingenuity and entrepreneurship is still hard at work now more than ever."}
{"text":"I had their Chicken Gyro along with their Greek Potato salad a week or so ago and learned two things: 1) Gyros don't need lamb to be tempting. 2) Olive oil can make potato salad sing as much as mayonnaise can. 

Support Pastitsio with all your dollars and gourmet hearts."}
{"text":"It's a strong start.

Saw a writeup for this place online, and stopped in last week for lunch.  The special was a rice, shrimp, and red sauce dish that was okay, but we also had the namesake - pastitisio - which was excellent.  

Tried the lemonade, which was cheap *and* actually made with lemons, delicious.  Took home a pound of dolmades - vegetarian grape leaves.  The dolmades were a touch dry, but didn't last the day anyways.

I'm interested in heading back in a month or so, seeing how the place progresses as they're open longer."}
{"text":"Nice lunch place, not the best atmosphere for a nice dinner.  Humus, although fresh, I have had better out of a container.  Lacked flavor and it was screaming for more olive oil.  Lamb gyro was excellent. Subtlety flavored lamb that was fresh, pita was perfect as was all the goodies inside.  Again nice place for lunch, just don't see the ambience for dinner."}
{"text":"Basic greek menu, gyros and a few entrees were good. If you like falafel do yourself a favor and don't order here. Found it mushy and tasteless, worst I've ever had,  was served with tzatziki sauce, not tahini sauce as it should be."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch with a friend and were very pleasantly surprised. The menu offers a 4-5 salads, 5-6 sandwiches, and 6-7 entrees, along with a few small appetizers and desserts; however, what the menu lacks in breadth, the cook makes up for in execution. The food was simple and the flavors were right on. Meats come from local farms and ingredients are fresh. Service was quick and friendly - the owner even came over to say hello and chat for a few minutes. Our bill was $25 for lunch and a drink for three people. We definitely plan to go back and eat on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I love this place from the service, to the look/feel inside to the food. This place serves arguably the best Greek food in Pittsburgh. I went here for the first time with my girlfriend because we were new to the Lawrenceville area (just moved) we both agreed it was delicious. 

We now even just stop by for some pitas to take back home for us to use with the rest of our hummus. Great service, food and location."}
{"text":"Their gyro sauce is very different from other gyros I've had. Pretty good place, wish I could have tried the other things. Next time I will. Me and my boyfriend ate our whole gyros. Very good!"}
{"text":"I decided to start with lunch for the first part of my cookie tour. This Greek restaurant opens at 11 so I ran in there to get out the cold. Yes, Yelpers you get one free spakopita with your check in. That is a square of phyllo layered with spinach, herbs and feta cheese. It is on their appetizer menu where you would get two for $6.00 if you wish.

I noticed on the menu that both their chicken pita and their lamb pita are both home bred meats from various farms. Throughout the past year I've been enjoying homegrown food wherever I visit so I opted for the lamb pita. This place is very small and takeout is available. Seating was not a problem for me since I got there when it opened. 

It did take a while to get the food but as the saying goes \"good things come to those who wait.\" I got my spakopita first and literally it was so good I was craving another. However, knowing I would be \"cookie logged\" today I resisted the temptation to buy the appetizer.

My gyro came with a side salad and a sauce which my waitress told me was very hot and spicy. I really appreciate her telling me this because I can't handle things like that. Both the lamb gyro and salad were delicious! The salad really doesn't need any topping. It is good as it comes. As I was eating she brought me out my \"cookie\" which was homemade from scratch baklava. This small piece was so good I just had to buy a couple of pieces to take home with me for later.

They also offer vegetable, vegan, and gluten free items on the menu. It is Greek so you will find the traditional Greek fare along with some different things

This is one place on my I will return bucket list. As I noted it does take some time for your meal to be prepared but if it is delicious it is well worth the wait. Located near Arsenal Middle school towards lower Lawrenceville this place makes a healthy addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"As a proud black male with an education, let me tell you that I've had better Greek food. I awoke from my midday nap with obvious hunger in my belly, and I was craving something from the land---you know, made with vegetables and animals grazing on hillsides, like the pictures I've seen in books. 
Anyway, I headed down to Pastitsio for a gyro ($8, with a \"salad\"). The gyro perfection was indeed perfect, but the side salad was weak and sloppy wet with a flavorless oil sauce, like my Uncle Red's toupee they found after Katrina hit town.
The gyro was definitely flavorful, and not obscenely enormous like some places make them (Rodos Greek Cafe). But the salad was so bad, I knew I need to get home and Yelp to all my homies in the L-Ville. 
Service was fine and average, no complaints. And the atmosphere is hip metal tables, exposed brick, and yuppie hipster prices. There was a lovey-dovey couple next to me romantically sharing some rice pudding(also overpriced). 
My main gripe is that I don't feel I got $8 of gyro and salad--it shoulda been $5. And the menu had too many options. 
I'm a simple man, as you can tell by my picture. Cheap Greek food should be CHEAP.
Now, back to whoopin some ass..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Greek food when it's this good. Kebabs and roasted veggie sandwich are at the top of my ordering list. The problem with everything being so good here is that I have trouble making up my mind."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've waited this long to come here!  I passed it on Butler for months and months and never went in, but always thinking I had to go.  Now to think of how many delicious meals I have missed out on makes me sad!

I tried to order the lamb sandwich but they were out, so it could have ended badly.  But don't you worry, they still had veggies, so I opted for the roasted veggie sandwich.  It. Was. Incredible!  I loved the soft doughy pita, the delicious perfectly roasted roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant with a creamy saziki sauce. Of course, I also couldn't resist a beet salad side.  When you order a beet salad you never really know if you'll get (I mean, unless you read the menu...I just see beets and get excited!), greens and beets or just beets.  This time it was just beets, but it was still great with a slight taste of orange and vinegar.   

The place is super tiny, but wasn't too crowded.  The one negative thing was it was hot as hades inside.  I believe it was probably around 40 outside, so when I walked outside it was refreshing.  I even started fanning myself with a City Paper at one point!  

Other than that, killer meal and I will most definitely be putting this on my lunch rotation in Lola!"}
