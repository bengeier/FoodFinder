{"text":"I went here by myself for lunch and felt that the waitress was a bit rude. It was like she couldn't wait to get me out of there. Also, the food selection is lacking compared to other sushi places"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the quality of the food but the service wasn't the greatest and due to the fact they take the orders we were getting some strange looks when we kept ordering ...  Two of the employees where goofing around And completely ignores us the whole time ! Really upsetting when I thought I would love it there but service turned me off"}
{"text":"This was our first date location last year and we keep coming back. The food is always amazing here. We come here often. Their sashimi is top-notch! Tonight I ordered takeout and forgot to mention my severe sesame seed allergy. When I arrived I remembered and the staff quickly replaced all of the sesame - related product free of charge. Wow. Talk about amazing customer service. Thank you amazing staff and chefs at Hama Sushi!"}
{"text":"Terrible service (coming from a Chinese guy, who is used to poor service from Chinese restaurants).  Food edible.  Only reason to go is that there aren't any other options for Japanese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Takeout flyer advertised 10% off as a grand opening special, but when I tried to order they pulled a bait and switch and said I had to pay with CASH ONLY to get 10% off. Not a great start to the meal.  Ordered take out anyways because I wanted to give this place a chance. When I got it I was severely disappointed. These were the tiniest sushi pieces I've ever seen from a restaurant. I really felt scammed while I ate my \"meal\". What little I had to eat was alright. Not bad, but not great.  Verdict: This place is a ripoff. For the price there are definitely MUCH better places around. On the bright side at least no food poisoning."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi. So far this is the best restaurant in this area. Amazing all you can eat sushi. The only thing that was not great was the beef teriyaki. .a bit dry. Great service. Excellent food."}
{"text":"The food is very good for an AYCE place in this area I have been here a few times and the food is definitely what keeps me coming back.   The service on the other hand is another story, as typical with most AYCE places they tend to forget parts of orders and can be slow bringing it to the table but what happened today (Nov 8, 2015 at 4:00pm) was beyond anything you could imagine.  I walked in with my sister and the place was empty other than another table with two guys. The waitress tried to seat us right beside the door but we asked to be moved to the back because of a draft which she at first refused claiming those tables were not available but the other customers where sitting in that section of tables along the back, which is where we asked to be seated. She continued but eventually sat us there.   We placed our order and everything seemed to be fine, we received most of our order and then suddenly the waitress began yelling and screaming at a cook in the main area this continued for at least 10 minutes before they moved to the back of the restaurant. The whole time we could still hear them and also could hear plates being thrown. It was very unprofessional and kind of scaring considering at this point we were the only customers in the restaurant. The issue finally ended after 20/25 mins.  After witnessing all of that we were not given an apology in fact the staff stated as far away from us as they could. We finally finished up what we had already received and just decided to pay and leave. When we were paying no one apologized or offered a discount of any sort and we never ask but once we finished paying my sister and I both noted that some sort of apology should have been given and that we would like the manager to be made aware of our feeling about this whole thing!"}
{"text":"Restaurant with clean contemporary design. Very fast businesslike service, no small chat here! The price point for AYCE was below average, very good value, nice fresh cuts of salmon sashimi. Will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome, compared to the sushi places around here. Quality is the highest. Very fresh compared to the place around."}
{"text":"Lunch is $14.95 ayce  Service today was great no complaints.  Food Hama roll is really excellent Calamari if you order ask for no sauce its very salty Salmon rolls good Salmon teriyka is ok needs thinner and more sauce They dont have alot of standard fried stuff  Overall good. I will come back if anything for the hama roll"}
{"text":"1.5/5.  Really can't remember the last time I've been here, maybe 2 years back? Anyways, the food isn't too bad here, but I definitely wouldn't find myself choosing to come here over the other (better) sushi restaurants located literally around every corner.   If I can recall (correct me if I'm wrong), I don't believe they used an iPad ordering system, but rather old school pen and paper when I last visited. You would think that since they've decided to employ this method, their service would be extremely prompt.. I clearly thought wrong. I do remember the waitress taking 5ever to come around to take our order and on top of that, she even got the order wrong..   I mean, at that point it wasn't such a big deal that some of our order was wrong bc we were too hungry to care much. What made this experience oh so memorable was that it was a weekday evening, meaning it was pretty dead. So around the time we wanted to order dessert and leave, the entire staff gathered around for dinner at the empty tables. We sat there for a good ten minutes and no one turned our way and I really didn't think it was my job to put so much effort into getting their attention just so we could leave..   Needless to say, you're better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi fanatic and it's hard to find a good place, but this one is as good as it gets quality wise. The food is incredibly fresh and quick with a wide variety of options. You can do a \"diamond\" lunch, which is $ 4 more and you can have all the dinner options as well.   The service was amazing when it first opened, but can improve now. I find that every time I go there it's always the staff's lunch or dinner break and they sit on the main dining floor eating together. I wouldn't have a problem with that if they would still pay attention to their tables.   They also have a stamp card for lunch and after you collect a certain amounts, I believe it's 6, the 7th lunch is free.   Overall I love this place for the food and eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The food was basic and nothing special. Service was horrible, she barely made eye contact with us and wasn't polite. We noticed the difference how she treated the Asian customers and us. We still tipped her good and not even a thank you or have a nice day."}
{"text":"Nothing special many other great sushi places in Vaughan. The pieces are small and it looks like they don't take enough rice for the sushi rolls but just squish it on. The customer service isn't great I asked for no fish eggs they put it and I went back to get a new roll and the guy just put it in the same box.. cross contamination much?"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE dinner. Average service and mediocre food. There wasn't much variety compared to other AYCE establishments in the area. Sashimi was also cut very thinly and seemed to be still frozen when it came out - I could taste some ice.   May return, but there are better AYCE sushi establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  The waitress managed to roll her eyes twice when told we were ready to order.  The hot food was pretty good...but almost nothing is available for lunch sushi. The food was highly over salted.  Sushi was super tiny and fell apart so easily.  Bottom line: there are way better places in the area.  Masa sushi for one...  Won't be back again."}
{"text":"Happy Easter! Luckily this place was open for a quick lunch. Pros: great price! $13 per adult for lunch all you can eat, even on the weekend and even on Easter! Anywhere else would charge $20+. Rolls are fresh and taste okay. Not the best sushi I've ever had but not bad either. Can't complain too much. Interior is really nice! Hard to find a place with this aesthetic in Woodbridge-Maple.  Cons: service is laughable. The girl serving us hated her life today and made it blatantly obvious. She asked us if we were ready to order as we're still removing our jackets. Yes of course I'm ready to order, I mean I haven't even sat down yet but sure! The whole experience was a bit discombobulated. The servers were inattentive and forgetful, and there were a mere 3 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. We also ordered a green tea ice cream for me and vanilla ice cream for my partner and she looked at me and confirmed our order and I said yes. We got only green tea ice cream, and I told her that we ordered green tea as well as vanilla, so she returned with green tea ice cream topped with vanilla, and a deep fried banana. At that point we couldn't stop laughing. The service was literally so bad it was hilarious   Overall, if you just want a quick bite of cheap all you can eat, this is the place!! But if you're seeking the smallest shred of service and/or competence, I'd probably recommend another place :)"}
{"text":"I mean meh it's ok butterfly's are good staff is glaring you down have to ask for refill of water constantly which is annoying af"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The service is good. It's one of the better all you can eat sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and given the have that it's only a five minute drive from us, couldn't get better.  The tempura is crisp, the Edamame is perfect balance of crunchy and salty. The rolls are great, I'm not a fan of hand rolls so I cannot comment on those. But the maki, sushi are very fresh and tasty.  If I could give one advice to the owners:  The teriyaki could be forgotten of the menu. Just erase it and forget it ever existed. Pointless.  Other than that great AYCE pricing. Highly recommend is you don't feel like driving and want to eat on the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cost for dinner on a Weekend night is 23 dollars and that is soooo affordable for what you get here. Usually AYCE sushi is left for the weekdays and lunch because it can cost like 30 dollars at some places. When we walked in we were instantly seated and the servers were really nice.  We ordered right away and when we got our order the biggest thing I can say is that everything is freshly cooked and served. I know that sounds dumb but I never knew how only warm teriyaki, edamame and tempuras came out until this place served it all. The batter wasn't oily and runny which means it was fries at the proper temperature. The sashimi tastes fresh as well. Some places i have been to will have ice pieces attached and this place is really good. Maybe they source their fish correctly or don't freeze it for as long or at all. Who knows but I enjoy it. Their eel was really great, not rubbery or drenched with sauce. Beef sashimi is a MUSTTTTTTTT! I would totally return!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby at all!  I visited Hama twice now but really paid attention to detail the second time around. I went for lunch yesterday and alike Tasha's review, they are so fast! I ordered, ate and paid within 25 minutes. I am still in shock. I had time to shop still whilst on my lunch break.  The chairs are very comfy! Nice high backs with lots of cushioning. Me likely! I'm not a fan of AYCE places where you relay your order out loud to the server. I am all for the environment and saving paper but there's something about repeating your order verbally that makes you feel like such a fat ass, especially at AYCE. I won't hinder the rating for this since it's a personal preference and it is a pitiful one.  I ordered the Hama roll, the Boston roll, the UFO pizza thing, some salmon sushi, seaweed salad and a spicy butter fish hand roll. I liked it all! The crunchy bits were actually so crunchy. Crunchy enough that I shredded the roof of my mouth.. let it be known that this ain't no complaint! I dislike ordering crispy rolls and having them come out soggy so this time was epic. Truly epic. I really enjoyed the Boston roll too. While the sushi had just the right amount of rice, it could've used a bit more meat. The UFO pizza thing was very interesting and I'm digging it. It was a slice of yam tempura with tuna, spicy mayo and crunchies on top. The butter fish hand roll was also enjoyable.   In the 25 minutes of my stay, the waitress came around a handful of times for tea refills and to make sure everything was hunky dory.  Oh ya! Calling all ginger lovers - Hama's ginger is spicy, just the way it should be!  Overall, I am impressed with Hama and will be returning for lunch."}
{"text":"3.5/5.  I first came here when the restaurant opened and haven't been back as my friends prefer Kyoto an intersection down.   But I came here yesterday. Tuesday 2pm. The place wasn't packed. About 25% full. I was immediately greeted and seated upon entering and asked what I wanted to drink. When the water arrived, we got to order, but because their ordering procedure is to hand you a menu to verbally order from while they use their ipad to send the orders in, it got a bit messy? I felt very on the spot and rushed to get my order through. They didn't exactly seem patient....so I get what the previous reviews were saying when it came to attitude/eye rolls from servers.   One of my favourite dishes here is Enoki Beef Maki (I think that's what it was called). I ordered 2 to test it out and ended up ordering 8 my second round. The sushi is as tiny as I remember it the first time I came here. Food quality is definitely good though. Their spicy mayo is actually spicy. And if you've ever gone to competitor Kyoto, it is not. I wasn't a big fan of the spicyness, but to each their own because my friend loved it.   What I didn't like was that they came up to us and told us it was the last round of ordering. They weren't kicking us out, but they were ending lunch service....other sushi restaurants I've been to would just transition into \"dinner service\" and allow future customers to order from the dinner menu and price them for dinner AYCE after a certain time if they were not kicking you out. So, I was a bit disappointed that we had to again, on the spot, decide what we wanted and on a stroke of luck, hope we finished whatever we ordered or hope we ordered enough to be full at the end of the day.   Weekday lunch was $13+ taxes. Definitely worth it for quality of the food, but go earlier if you want to order more before lunch service ends!"}
{"text":"Hama sushi is a new sushi place in the Vellore Woods area. I definitely liked it for lunch. I let our server know I only had an hour and had to back at work. Their service was the speediest I've encountered at any restaurant during lunch. Ever. I wasn't really impressed with their miso soup. I did however like their seaweed salad and I found their salmon especially tasty! The rolls didn't stay together the greatest and they had a bit too much rice for me, but because of the fast service, delicious salmon, and price ($13 for lunch!), Hama sushi deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"They gave me a feee miso soup!  My first review of 2018!  Ordered from Hama tonight on skip the dishes.  Didn't know what to expect since S the D reviews seemed great but yelp not so much.    First off, portion sizes are very decent.   We had some maki rolls that were all \"standard\". Not your best sushi but good.    The nice surprise was the portion size/price of the chicken stir fry udon. It was definitely enough for two people.  It was somewhat bland in the salty department but had enough taste potential. Taste potential, Is that a thing? Well it is in 2018!  The free miso soup was miso soup. I swear all Japanese restaurants get it from the same place.    Otherwise, everything seemed ok. We'll definitely order from Hama again in a pinch.   Oh did I mention free soup? Accident? Who cares!"}
{"text":"Needed something quick while at work. Had the sashimi small set with seaweed salad on the side for take out. The fish wasn't as fresh as most places, I feel like i could've gotten same value and quality of sushi from the mall.  The seaweed salad was okay.... It came with a small salad that was lacking colour in greens, and quantity.  The miso soup also came with it and for someone who eats sushi often this was by far the worst because there was No flavour, you can tell it was extremely watered down.  It's run by bunch of Chinese people which is usually a red flag to most sushi places, I'm not trying to be rude, this is just from my experience! Most sushi joints run by Koreans or Japanese people provide a better sushi experience. If you want good sushi in the area, try going to MI NE SUSHI."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hopelessly flawed in three key categories for any moderately decent restaurant. Firstly, the service was entirely lacking, the staff had less personality than R2-D2 at a salsa party. The sushi was poorly cut and clearly old. The cooked foods such as general Tao chicken and teriyaki chicken were over-sweetened and most likely microwaved. Finally, the manager was cold and slightly rude.   Worst of all, they poured water into my brother's glass of ginger ale.   I asked for more wasabi twice, and only received it after we were already done with our meal.   Come to this restaurant if you want to disappoint your bank account and self respect."}
{"text":"Just ordered some delivery from Hama last night, it was my first time trying the restaurant. Pretty decent food, ordered the california mako, katsu chicken maki and enoki beef rolls.. They're all pretty good actually, tasty and nicely wrapped... The enoki beef arrived a little cold, where it's best to have when sizzling hot, but that's not the restaurant's fault or anyone really...it's delivery and -20+ out! So i'll give it another shot some other time, i'll go and dine in.. But all in all, not bad at all..will try again soon."}
{"text":"Went to Hama Sushi with my wife last night and loved the experience. Dinner is $23/head and it's all you can eat. They have a fair number of vegetarian options as well which my wife appreciated. Some of my favourites were:  Kani Salad Mango Salad White Dragon Rolls Beef with Asparagus Grilled Squid Green Tea Icecream  Overall the service was great. The staff are attentive and the food tasted fresh. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Hey Ma, Sushi!   Just dropped by here for some lunch sushi with mah gurl!  The sushi was FRESH! I don't know if it's because the place is new, but yeah, the sushi was really fresh which is always a great thing. The maki rolls could have maybe used a little more salmon in them, but I like how they weren't stuffed with rice *cough* ayce sushi in square one *cough*   The seaweed salad was tasty and not drenched in dressing. The miso soup wasn't spectacular but the rolls more than made up for it. I had a salmon hand roll which was quite good (salmon all the way to the bottom). Also had some edamame! Love dem Japanese beans. Their menu isn't huge but everything that we tried was delicious. For dessert they have various ice cream flavours (green tea, mango, chocolate, etc.) the ice cream was good but apparently it tastes like \"white person ice cream\" according to my gf lol  The inside decor is nice. I like the way the menus look. Also the service was FAST! I was impressed. They have a lot of staff working which is why I think it was so quick. Our green teas never went past half without being filled, and the staff was friendly. I can't complain. Kudos to these guys.   Overall, I enjoyed this place, I would come back if I find myself in the area again."}
{"text":"One of the most solid all-around AYCE sushi joints in Vaughan.  Chefs have improved greatly over the past year after a somewhat shaky start, and have turned this restaurant into one of the most consistently good sushi places in the city.  Usually not a fan of all-you-can-eat sushi, but the quality of their non-sushi offerings really help elevate the overall experience -- the chicken wings alone are far better than the wing bar across the street.  Can't go wrong with a $13 lunch, complete with very solid salmon kama, enoki beef rolls, and beef fried rice dishes.  Servers can be a bit awkward at times, but are attentive and quick.  Highly recommend Hama Sushi over other AYCE's in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi.   Great variety from sashimi, hand rolls, traditional rolls, tempura and other favs like udon and fried rice.  Really fresh n tasty butterfish and salmon.    Signature items to have are beef wrapped asparagus , enoki beef maki and grilled squid.   Came in tues evening so it was manageable for small staff on hand.   Limited seating with clean modern decor."}
