{"text":"Small place, but great food! Their 'chicken' practically tastes like the real deal! The lady serving my food was very informative and polite. The food was totally worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to making the trek to Ital Vital after the glorious write up in the Toronto Star. Sadly I was a bit disappointed. Food was alright, although I felt most of the vegetables were under seasoned while the BBQ soy was super sweet. It was the service, or lack thereof, that surprised me. I felt like my presence was a nuisance as the man who filled my order didn't look at me once and barely spoke. Just nods and one word answers. Overall, super unfriendly and because of that I won't be making the trip to nowheres-ville again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the only reason the rating is low is because they ALWAYS run out of food. The hours listed on the door are not correct !! Beware if you want food on a Friday there is rarely food after 7pm and this has happened to me multiple times. Food is great, but the HORRIBLE customer service really makes you want to go anywhere near this place."}
{"text":"Just got take out from here.... it is AMAZING!!! I can't believe I didn't know about this place until now.   Great portions. Great value. Delicious vegan food."}
{"text":"FINALLY! An all-vegan take-out that sells some home-cooked food!   Been there a few times. The place is quiet for the most part and the food is very fresh (If you need to cut down on your sodium intake, I would recommend this place for you - not to imply that the food is bland, they lean on the vegetables natural flavours and depending on your mood, you can appreciate it) Surprisingly though, I'm a fan of all that they serve except the soy-ribs. I find the soy-ribs to be chewy and glazed over -  I haven't had ribs in forever so I don't know if its toughness is suppose to be like that (But there's no bone in them, so should they be?).  Anywayz, it sucks that they only take cash, but they're independent through and through, so I can respect that... just can't eat there all the time.   The chana dal needs more potato and less chickpeas. $5 for a medium blended juice is a bit pricey.  I understand it's Ital food... but if they ever want to consider frying some plantain in some vegan butter that would be great, or sell vegan vegetable patties that would be good too.  The owner is really friendly, the other staff members are a bit humbly quiet. They would do well to take pointers from their boss.   The portions are generous and you get a variety of what they have to offer with the $7 (small) and $12 (Large).  Overall, I will continue to come as long as their is a commitment to improving as the years go on. They just opened in February so I won't be too critical of what they haven't got yet.  Check it out. Try it out. Write an honest opinion here on yelp.  I believe their 11am-9pm M-F."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything we ordered taste yummy. From the outside you'd think you were in the wrong place for not a din in type of place. We are so happy we walked in bc I've never been impressed with vegan food."}
{"text":"I was a vegetarian for 9 years living in the Agincourt area of Scarborough, I had access to two really great Chinese vegetarian places  and grew up eating a lot of soy proteins and beans. As a vegetarian it was hard to find healthy food that was not just a menu option without the meat. Like a veggie sub or like something sweet at a bakery.  I am no longer vegetarian, but I am glad that I stopped by Ital Vital today.   I got a small order of food that included: sheppards pie, macaroni, broad beans, callaloo, faux chicken drum stick and bbq seitan for 10 bucks. It was a heavy plate of food and it was all really tasty. I like this because it offers everybody a healthy eating alternative. It is hard to find a healthy eating option in this area. Ital has so many choices, the value is awesome (it was literally pounds of food) and it is awesome if you are veg or not. Thank you for the healthy quick food option I will be returning!"}
{"text":"BBQ soy chunks are great. If it's your first time and you're not sure what to get, ask for the \"full spread\", you'll get a bit of everything!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fresh delicious vegan food. The bbq tofu ribs are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went with a couple non-vegan friends and we all loved it. Delicious. Would have been 5 stars if they had't been closed the time I tried to go back at 7 when the sign said open until 9"}
{"text":"I don't know what I love more, the food or the owner! This place is amazing. AMAZING. I haven't been in a few months and I am having some major cravings. A mix of everything is definitely the way to go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch this afternoon. We went for the large plate  ($12) and shared. Everything was so tasty! I could probably eat a whole plate of their BBQ Soy by myself.. Worth trying out when you are in the area."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Definitely worth every penny! The $7 combo is enough for two meals- there's so much food in one container. The food is delicious and has a fresh taste to it and great whether you're vegan or not. Don't be fooled by the location in such a tiny plaza - this place is really good and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN FOOD IN TORONTO You can feel the love in the food and from the people who create this wonderful food I LOVE YOU GUYS!"}
{"text":"I went to Ital Vital today after reading about it on a review of the best vegetarian restaurants in T.O. I am not a vegan/vegetarian but enjoy eating meat free dishes some of the time. I have to agree with the other review that I have read here, This food is sooooo good! My wife and I both had the $7 mixed plate and everything was delicious.  If I had to pick a favourite I would say the BBQ soy, honestly as delicious  as any BBQ pork I have ever had. It is about a 15 mins drive from my house to the restaurant which is probably a good thing or else I may become a daily visitor."}
{"text":"As other mentioned..its a small place that's easy to miss when driving by. You can park on side street  I don't eat vegan food often but this place makes me want to eat it more regularly.  The food I had was very tasty especially the soy bbq. Too bad they were out of a few other things on the menu.   Only down side was the cookies...they were pricey $3  each and weren't very yummy."}
{"text":"Serving up a great balance of variety, this Rastaraunt's got your back on flavour and nutrition. Portions are generous and the menu rotates daily. If you plan on stopping in, I recommend treating yourself to a fresh alkaline juice too. It's packed with lemon, lime, green apple, pineapple and is just plain tasty all around."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this place! I am in love. Food looks and tastes so fresh. It's hard to find take out that works with a clean eating lifestyle! As another poster said, it's cash only so be ready for that. $10 gets you a container that could easily be two meals."}
{"text":"Deeeeelish. BBQ was amazing. So much flavour. Hot sauce is on point. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from this place and I have to restrain myself from not eating here everyday for lunch. The best vegan place in Toronto, hands down."}
{"text":"So pleased to have a vegan restaurant in my area. The price is reasonable for the amount that you get. The $7 option should be good for two people to share. The food is not spicy and mildly flavored so should be good for a sensitive stomach or one that doesn't like over powering flavors and spice.   Best item for sure is the BBQ tofu. If I could get a whole container of that alone I would it's so good. Highly recommend based on quality of food and price."}
{"text":"So it's my first time here and one word comes to mind AWSOME! IT'S SO FREAKING GOOD it's so healthy ad tasty words don't do justice you have to try this place..fast quick and affordable plus the portions are large. Why did I wait so long to try this place? Go here eat and enjoy the super good healthy food!!"}
{"text":"I'm no vegan but have always wondered what vegan food may be like. I do like my veggies fix sometimes though so let me say this is my all time favourite thus far. I've been to one other vegan restaurant (I believe it was called Fresh or something like that) and this may not be relevant to some people but for me, it was my second time coming here. I may be interested in what vegan food may be like but I have never intended to return again after the first visit.  I originally discovered this heaven of a place downtown with a friend. I believe it was somewhere south west of spadina and bloor (couldn't locate it on Yelp after my visit...). But after tasting the wonderful deeeeeliiiiiiiciousness I knew I was definitely returning. The flavours were soooo yummy and the amount of food you get for what it's worth is on point! You get a bit of salad along with your whole meal! I think this sums up my love for veggies haha! If I ever have any cravings this will be the first place I think of. Their soy-based food are also pretty impressive! I tried their bbq stuff and those taste just as good too! Although, I am no fan of soy-based things so that says something.  During my downtown adventures I met this man named Dwayne (I think that was his name...) working there but he works more frequently in the Scarborough location. Lucky me because he added to the whole delightful experience! Very friendly, explained each dish to me and what it had in it and we had good conversations too!  Both locations are somewhat small so if you are going with a small group of people you guys MAY be able to fit depending on numbers...I'd guesstimate probably 10 ppl can fit in each location so just be weary ;)  Anyways if you are vegan, I hope you are already aware of this place and if not, try it out! If you aren't vegan like me but feeling adventurous then I definitely recommend this place for you!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30pm on Sunday, 1.5hrs before they're expected to close, but they RAN OUT OF FOOD! The gentleman working there was really nice, apologized, and promptly gave my friend and I a complimentary slice of Banana bread (delicious, moist, and light). He said that they usually run out of food Sundays. Guess this means it's a popular place with good food. I'll try again another time."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try this place out, and I was not disappointed. I went in at around 6:30pm on a weekday and unfortunately they had already sold out of most items (which apparently happens every day around the same time, popular!) but I was able to purchase a takeaway container filled to the brim with rice, eggplant stew, soy BBQ and salad. Everything was delicious and fresh tasting. It was around $7 for a 'small' container and the portion was very generous.  This place is easy to overlook -in fact I have driven past it millions of times without realizing that there was such a gem there! The staff are super friendly and the food is super tasty - great for vegetarians, vegans and non-meat eaters alike!  Note: take-out only besides a small table by the door."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with my dinner.   Got bbq ribs with a basmati rice cook Up, quinoa, curried cauliflower and chickpeas. I ordered a small ($10) and it lasted me two days. The portion was huge! Also got marshmallow cookies that were very yummy and not sweet at all (2 for $5).   Really looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"First time going yesterday, and honestly I'm just going to echo everyone else's positive reviews.  The portion (small) was huge, the food was delicious, and the staff was friendly.  I've already got cravings for the tofu pulled 'pork'.  The world needs more Rastafarian vegan restaurants.  I wish they took debit, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place, which is saying a lot for a non-vegan dragged there by my vegan friend, we both got the Large \"Bit of Everything\" combo for $15 each.  I will echo many of the things others have said: - BBQ Soy is amazing, very reminiscent of thin strips of Chinese beef, with a nice tender/chewy/meaty texture, in a simple but yummy BBQ sauce. So good, my vegan friend was actually suspicious that she has accidentally been served BBQ beef in error. - Curry Shrimp were fascinatingly textured, similar but different than real shrimp, but tasty, and in a great curry sauce - get extra curry over your rice & peas, so delicious. - The callaloo greens were yummy and added a real authentic Jamaican flavour - \"Chow Mein\" was more bulk than flavour, and would be hugely improved by chinese \"mein\" noodles instead of the pedestrian italian spaghetti noodles used. (Yes, really). - Rice&Peas were delicious, and exactly how they should be. - The rest was chick peas and kidney beans and veggies, which were fine, not earth shattering, but nice \"sides\", but a little heavy on the bell-peppers.  The food seemed fresh and well-prepared Sunday @ 2pm, despite coming from the steam table, with lots of flavour and spices, but sadly lacking any heat whatsoever, possibly because we weren't offered any Jamaican \"pepper\" or hot sauce.  Will I return? Definitely! Next time, lots more BBQ, plus Rice & Peas with Curry of the Day, + hoping to try the Okra, Bok Choy, and more interesting veggies, with LOTS of 'pepper'! :)   **NOTE that their HOURS HAVE CHANGED since the 2014 poster's photo of their hours, with some slightly odd and quirky hours, including Sundays, so CALL AHEAD to be sure. **Someone should take down that picture.**"}
{"text":"You guys already know how I  feel about this spot! this is just another check in. I come here like two times a week. I live for this place. I always talk about the food but they also have incredible vegan desserts and smoothies. I always get the power punch smoothie with spirulina !!!! it's a super food boost"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a couple years, and it's only 5 minutes from my office - yet my first visit was just last week. Perhaps if a non-vegan place was this highly rated and close, then I would've found myself here earlier - but alas I finely made it.  As other reviewers have described, it's located in a small, old plaza, with very limited parking. With that said, the cross street alongside it has free and ample parking. There's literally one bench with 4 barstools for seating, so don't make plans beforehand for dinning in.  The workers there (possibly the owners) are very friendly and super generous with their portions. The way it works is that for $10, you get the 'small' order (with that box being more than enough for most appetites) and for $15 is the large. Only one out of 5 of us who came in together finished the entire large box in one go. The way you receive your food is similar to food court Chinese - not the food per se, but that the food is in a heating tray, you pick 1-2 carbs and then a choice of a few proteins and vegetables.   They allowed me to split my carbs (I went with rice and peas, and then quinoa). With that, I opted for callaloo, pumpkin, curried chick peas and a kidney bean dish. Of course, I went with the BBQ tofu, which honestly does taste like a stir fried beef. They also threw on fried plantain and then from a choice of fresh greens, I went with grape tomatoes and two different sprouts. I would estimate that there were about 10 choices from the hot foods (so I had about half), and there were about as many choices for the fresh veggies.  Phenomenal value and very good food. I would stop short of saying it was excellent however since it seems like more a collection of good, healthy sides rather than a unified dish. Nonetheless, it was satisfying and good for them in having success with a fairly niche approach (Jamaican Rastarian vegan cuisine) in Scarborough. Judging by the steady stream of people coming in and that they've been open for a few years, it's working out quite well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. They are very generous with the portions and the tiny restaurant is awesome. Absolutely amazing in every way. The best vegan restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I was so glad to hear of a vegan restaurant in Scarborough that I rushed right over.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and they clearly take pride in their food.  The portions are generous and you get a little of everything served over a bed of rice and peas.  All of the dishes on offer when I visited were flavorful and delicious!  I'll be back, no doubt.  This is definitely more of a takeout spot, only or two tables that I could see, but what it lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in flavour.  This is the kind of vegan food that goes over well with non-vegans too."}
{"text":"Best vegan restaurant in the city! Hands down. Tasty, healthy and good portions.Great value"}
{"text":"I went the other day with my friends and unfortunately I noticed the large is much smaller now and the quality changes everyday. There are also fewer customers now so I suppose they realize as well. Will be looking on yelp for other vegetarian options. :("}
{"text":"I would have given this a 5/10 because of how amazing their food is, but I'm rating it a 4 because they do not realize their business potential. What I mean by that is it's frustrating that such a popular restaurant closes its doors early almost consistently at around 7:30pm throughout the week because they sell out of food and the cook leaves to go home early, considering they have clearly posted that they close at 9pm. I wasted my time driving there all the way from Greektown for their food once to find out they closed early because they sold out of food and called two other times to find the same thing happened. And that was THREE TIMES in one week (and that was only when I called!) I really hope they do better for their customers in the future by deciding to stay open and make food until the time they say they are going to close because they are missing out on opportunities to make more money and business. Equally, I missed 3 opportunities this week at 7:30pm to eat some great food. So I'm feeling frustrated and may no longer be able to eat there, which is disappointing because I really want to. But they aren't open when they say they are.  Please just stay open longer and make more food! Trust me, you will have it all gone anyway by 9pm and won't have to waste any because your food is good!!! It sells itself!"}
{"text":"omg - I will drive to Scarborough from Kingston JUST for the okra stew --- SO DELCIOUS. It's a little hole in the wall. You get small or large (small is a TONNE of food - 3 stews with rice and noodles, or LG is rice and noodles with a sample of all 6-8 stews on that day)  I got the small -- pumpkin, okra and callalloo --- all exploding with flavour with a piece of bread fruit. Authentic delicious jamaican food and crazy affordable - $9 for the small and I couldn't event finish it. If you're in Scarborough make a point to go out of your way to eat here.... only a couple wee tables inside as it's mostly take out but worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Ital Vital is a Caribbean/Rastafarian vegetarian mom and pops restaurant/juice bar located in a small corner plaza on Pharmacy Ave in Scarborough. Seating is limited inside and it's more of a takeout place. Parking is also really limited, so most people park on Leahurst Dr. and walk over.  I'm not a vegetarian but I try and eat healthy on a regular basis. It's really important what you put into your body but I don't find most vegetarian places too appealing from a taste perspective but Ital Vital is really delicious even from a non vegetarian perspective.  I normally order a small box ($10 tax included) which consists of either rice or noodles with a main, two sides, a salad and plaintain. I normally get the soy tofu bbq ribs as the main with noodles and okra and roasted vegetables as the two sides. It also comes with a salad and some plaintain.  The noodles are okay, the okra and roasted vegetables are nicely done but the standout is the soy tofu bbq ribs. The soy tofu bbq ribs taste like the real thing and are really good. The whole meal is pretty filling and reasonably priced at $10 tax included.  Ital Vital is a really good and healthy food option that makes tasty food that is appealing to vegetarians and non vegetarians. It's also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nice ital food spot  Had the ital stew both visits, bbq soy is really good and is an interesting twist on a product that is notoriously difficult to find different interesting tastes for, they succeeded here  Some days have different food so be sure to check their website for that info   All in all a good spot which is recommended for vegans, vegetarians or others looking for a veggie meal"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best vegan food I've had. Their BBQ soy tastes exactly like meat (like literally!) and is to die for. And I love that it still tastes like authentic caribbean food even though it's vegan. You get a good portion of food for a decent price.   It's a little Caribbean restaurant with limited seating and limited food, nothing fancy. But like I said, the food is so tasty.   **Important tip: they only take cash (which sucks).   My only complaint is that I when I went there on Sunday, they were supposed to be open by 12 and they still weren't open and this was around 2:30. Even the sign on their door with the hours of operation said the restaurant was supposed to be open. If you're not going to be open when you say you are, you should formally change your hours and not just make up your own. If it weren't for this I'd have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious! I am not a vegan but I love good food. I absolutely love this place. Its a tiny spot with very friendly service from a steam counter and a great variety of fresh and healthy dishes. Ive found it hard to find good food that is also healthy in this area. I am so happy I found Ital Vitals!"}
{"text":"Great price and delicious food. Didn't feel like I was missing meat at all. Love the bean dish and the BBQ soy. They also have amazing drink that are made with fresh fruits. The blueberry cheesecake was an absolute delight. Not to much sugar and the right softness."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was okay. The only curry that stood out on its own was the potato curry and the bbq tofu. The chow mein was inedible, I should've asked to just get more rice n peas. However, with the hot sauce, everything livened up. Definitely a lot of food but I paid $14.50 per large order.  Just came back from Negril and ate at a ton of Ital places and I'm not sure this place compares. I may give it another try since they have a rotating menu, perhaps the curries I had on the Monday menu were not their best. Also, the cashier didn't remember what price he told me and asked me to tell him again, feel a little bit scammed (like shouldn't the prices be standard??)."}
{"text":"This is an restaurant that everyone should experience!! The staff were awesome, the choices were plentiful and delicious. The price was more than fair (remember this is still old school, so cash only) and the restaurant was bright, clean and colourful.  So, they have two choices the small for $10.00 and the large for $15.00.   We as a couple started off in Kensington Market and were met with the owner a most helpful Rasta man. He helped us choose all of our selections and I assure you, that even with the small there is enough for two.  Now, there is enough for two, but hear me when I say you'll want your own as it's just that good. I will include here that on the way home we stopped at the Pharmacy location and got the large. What more can be said about a restaurant that you are willing to visit both locations and up-size all in one day. I would say try the vegan \"meat\" as it is incredible, but try everything!!    A final note, although I have used Yelp for years, I joined as a subscriber only for the purpose of writing a review on this restaurant. I eat out every weekend and this is by far the best."}
{"text":"I went here on Tuesday & pick-up a large which cost $15 (also you should note, they take cash only).  The food was ok.  The large gives you a little of everything.  I like the pumpkin.  I think a lot of the reviews here say it's the \"best\" really have not had good vegan food."}
{"text":"I love this spot!  I am not vegan, but I am looking to move in to a low carb diet, due to health reasons. Initially, I was upset as now I have to move from fatty foods, like pizza, burgers, hakka, etc.   After finding Ital Vital, I know that I could do this, brown rice, sweet potatoes, soy, honestly I could not tell the difference from what I used to eat.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Massive portions. Low prices.   There is not enough that can be said about the value from Ital Vital. I discovered this place in March and have already been back a dozen times. If you are hungry and on a budget, you need to make the trek to Ital Vital... whether or not you like vegetarian food. Service is also incredible - the guys working there are cool dudes with a passion for good food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been really searching hard lately to satisfy my WFPB outings. I think this stuff is definitely on the rise but still in it's infancy. Anyhow, on this fine evening I came across this via Yelp and the reviews are spectacular. Bold claims like the best vegetarian/vegan establishment in Toronto; I AM SOLD.  This is a little takeout joint with about 3 tables seemingly hidden in a random side of the road plaza. It's pretty easy to miss this place but I was on a mission. As I walked in, I was quite surprised to the number of people here seemingly on a random weeknight. There was this real laid back dude behind the counter by himself struggling to serve guests. No..not that he was bombarded but he was just so chills it looked like he struggled hard with each and every box of food. We must have waited like 20 minutes for him to fill 3 takeout containers. LOL  Slow service aside, this is the real deal! We had the works which was just an entire box of whatever he had cooked that day (about 6-8 items) and the infamous bbq tofu along with a side of salad. Everything was well prepared and extremely flavourful. The bbq was definitely a highlight and it deserves every bit of praise from others.  Overall, the small box which was well above it's weight and way too much food for one was something like $10. This is a steal! And considering how fantastic the food is, this is absolutely amazing! This is one of the sleeper gems in the city."}
{"text":"This place is a find. I'd been meaning to get there for awhile, and finally found myself in the neighbourhood on a sunny, humid Saturday afternoon. I was so dehydrated from the walk that I grabbed the first cold drink I saw - a sugary fruit punch. Kind of wish I'd waited and tried a smoothie.  Electrolytes replenished, I dug into my food: chow mein noodles, curried pumpkin, and alarmingly realistic shrimp and barbecued pork, both vegan, as is everything in the house. Although it was the middle of the day, a DJ was spinning good reggae, which added to the atmosphere. I felt obligated to buy one of his CDs at the door.  The food was so good, I went back an hour later for take-out for dinner. As others have noted, the lack of air conditioning can make the place a tad uncomfortable, especially on a muggy summer day. Of course, I suppose it also adds to the authenticity.  My one complaint was the lack of heat in the food, in both the temperature and the spice level. I would have liked to be offered some hot sauce.  All that said, it's a definite addition to the regular roster."}
{"text":"I have tried their rice bowl with soy chicken, pumpkin curry and callalou. Oh men! The best I ever had!! Really yummy and the servers are all very welcoming and nice! I would totally eat it again and again! *drooooling already*"}
{"text":"This restaurant was simply put AMAZING,  in every bite you crave a next one .. Guilt free deliciousness I want there food forever!!  Come January Im starting a 30 day vegan challenege..  With this restaurant I'll succeed forsure lol!! The portion size was huge for a small I could only imagine the large portion!!  Open more locations please!  This restaurant needs to be world wide so we can have more concious eaters!! The lady that served us was so sweet. And was very confident that we would be back,  she was right we went earlier this afternoon for lunch I plan on going back tonight for dinner lol  THANK YOU   SINCERELY, a forever customer!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with the wifey after a Costco run and searched for a vegetarian or vegan restaurant near by online. It was a cozy little place with a good vibe to it. The decorations, music, and art were a nice touch and I enjoyed that they had a chalk menu so it can change on a whim thereby allowing seasonal choices and proper stock rotation .. something that I am keen on. The owner was really friendly and informative and helped us with our order.   The sights and aromas of the food was enough to pique my interest and I wanted to try it all but settled on 3 choices served with chow mien, rice and peas, and other fresh veggies. The food was exquisite! I enjoyed everything and the portion size was also very large, I got a small for 7$ and there was a larger one for 10$ - probably a good choice for a family meal.  We ate half of our meal there and decided to save the rest for later so we didn't get too stuffed and had a nice snack for later on. The hot sauce we were offered was also very delicious, not overtly spicy but really tasty and full of flavor with a nice kick to it.  We will definitely be going back for more and suggest anyone else who wants scrumptious food made with love to try it out and see what I mean."}
{"text":"I was so happy earlier this year when I found a vegan Caribbean place on the EAST end of the city. I'm so happy this place decided to locate on the east end. My views on Ital vital are a little all over the place. I really enjoy this place & will continue to come back for sure. I've brought friends here & will continue to bring friends here & support the business.   The things I dislike of the place are -You call to order takeout to be picked up & you come & they don't have it ready.  -They have been out of food oodles of times -No air conditioning so getting the food in the summer you get all gross & sweaty waiting -Then prices change depending on who's working (only by if you get charged tax but still) -They only take cash -Portions are different depending on who's working  That all being said I love the food & I can only have like three things on the menu because of a coconut allergy but I LOVE those three things. If I could eat them everyday I think I would. The prices aren't bad for the amount of food you get. $7 for small & $12 for a large. The large is big enough for two people to split IMO. I would 110% recommend this place but just keep in mind it has some quirks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The BBQ tofu is too die for. The service was great the lady was super friendly. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of seating area."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, limited seating and parking (more for takeout). All vegan options and depends on time of day you go as it takes time to refill their selection (10min wait for refills of rice/curries when we arrived).   Only debit or cash! Owner offered for us to pay him back next time we visit if we were a few dollars short (it was our first time there); which was nice of him.  Would come again as food was delicious and definitely filling!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much I crave it all the time! The portions are very generous & the service is quick."}
{"text":"I love this place!   The first time I went there I thought \"oh wow.. maybe I made a mistake coming here\".  It looks like the kind of place I would avoid.  Then I walked in and was greeted by a lovely lady behind the counter and all reservations were gone!  Great tasting healthy food at a good price plus it's gluten free.  I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I love eating here.  You truly don't miss the meat.   I will say that I'm not fond of the texture of the soy shrimp.  My favourite is the bbq. It tastes just like you're eating meat.  The texture is fantastic. I do my best to eat there when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Parking: Free - very small lot with limited parking spots, there's probably only 4 spots available and it's beside a convenience store lmao.  Washrooms: Bathroom goes into some sketchy looking basement and was relatively clean.  Experience/Venue: Small venue with 1 table and one of those wall shelves.   Food: Food is great! I would keep coming back if it wasn't so far from where I live, I grab the \"large of everything\", which is basically they give you the large container and put all the food in there that's made."}
{"text":"Located on a itsy-bitsy strip mall in a residential neighborhood off Pharmacy, you might easily pass it while driving by. As the selection for vegetarian food in Scarborough is limited to mainly Asian fare, I decided to try and support this new Caribbean joint.  I told the server I was a new customer and he showed me the options. You can either get a small box for $7 or a large for $12. For most people in the area, this might not be affordable for lunch. As a general rule, it's best to keep lunch customers moving in and out and serve a good deal under $10 that would spread well by word of mouth.   Either way, I got to nibble on every dish there was. The $12 was gigantic and could have easily feed another person. The okra was great, the beans were tasty and the rice was nice. My sister and I also liked the BBQ 'pork', which reminded me of Chinese roasted pork, in my pre-vegetarian days. However, having just come back from Eurasia, the eggplant couldn't compare to what I'd been eating for the last two weeks. All the flavours were quite mild though and I'm not sure that this might grab and retain customers. However, I would definitely give Ital Vital another go."}
{"text":"Oh yummy, yummy veggies subtly seasoned and served up hot and fresh. This rastaraunt rules. Tiny place with huge heart. Be prepared to feel the love.   Give tanks fi di food weh yuh provide! I'll soon be back!"}
{"text":"Plentiful and delicious. Friendly service. I will definitely return. A good assortment and variety of choses. The portions are huge. If you are lucky you can grab the patio seats."}
{"text":"I was driving along Pharmacy and saw this small place called Ital Vital tucked away in the corner beside a convenience store (could easily pass by). Decided to walk in that day because I was really hungry and I've heard good things about it on Yelp. I walked in, was greeted by the owner who was very nice. I walked in while they were opening up so I had a limited choice in what I could pick. There are two options Small($7) and Large($12). I ordered the small, I got the mixed beans and rice, Curry Chick Peas, BBQ Soy and salad. The Rice was really good cooked properly, Chick peas were nice had a hint of heat, noodles were good and the BBQ soy was amazing almost mistaked it for chicken, I might go full Vegan, I could eat there food all day. Overall my experience was great , will be back to try the Pumpkin , Bok Choi and Okra Dishes"}
{"text":"Amazing food for good price. My only complaint is that I haven't been able to order the large size yet as they are always sold out of dishes when I go. I haven't been able to try all the dishes they offer. :(  So go well before closing if you want to try everything!!  This is definitely a more 'to go' type establishment as there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"3.5/5  After seeing Ital Vital at the Veggie Food Fest last weekend at Harbour Front, I thought I would stop by and check it out.   First, the restaurant is a bit difficult to find and you will have to park on a side street most likely, so be prepared for that.   After not seeing a menu online, I tried my luck and called to see if I could order takeout - but the restaurant is a choose your own, owner-served buffet style type - so ordering takeout is difficult, but not impossible if you know what you want.   Ital Vital is very small but has a clean appearance and is very aromatic. There was a line when I went, and others around me said there is typically a line no matter what time you go. The wait time was about 8 minutes, but it passed by quickly.   The pricing is $10 for a small plate and $15 for a large. The serving sizes are quite generous so take that into account when ordering. The service is also friendly and they take time to explain what side dish is what.   Everything at this restaurant is vegetarian, which I absolutely love! When I got home, although the drive was quite a distance, the food was still hot and fresh. The food tastes great and has very unique flavours. The soy BBQ \"steak\" (comes with every meal) tastes very similar to real meat. However, be warned about the extremely deadly hot sauce. Unknowingly, I drizzled some of it on my rice, and it would be an understatement to say my mouth was on fire. If you can handle extreme heat, by all means...otherwise stay away. As I completed my meal I really appreciated the time an effort put into each side dish made from the stewed vegetables to the macaroni to the chick peas. All of it was quite delicious.   This rating lost stars from me because of the distance and wait time, but all in all, a solid choice especially if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is REAL! Very delicious and healthy. BBQ is mouth watering, the entire meal was satisfying to the soul. Also great service, I would definitely recommend a try. ( appearance from outside could be improved though ;)"}
{"text":"Yummm, went to this place to get a take out box a few months back.. it was the end of the day so they gave us a bit of everything. It was great! Protein/Soy tasted really good."}
{"text":"This is a great vegan place to get some amazing Caribbean food! When my boyfriend was vegan and we didn't want to cook, this place was worth the drive for some bomb take out. The small box is $10 and the large is $15. We pretty much always get rice as the base (I think it tastes much better than the noodles) and try to get a bit of everything, the guy behind the counter usually offers it as the everything combo. The soy bbq meat is great and I thoroughly enjoy all the different flavours they have in their curries and stewed vegetables. It is a bit of a difficult place to park, but again so worth it. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed. I used to come here when I lived in the area. I came by today at 7:50pm and it says online and on the front door open til 9pm and it was completely closed."}
{"text":"Really delicious meal with a great variety of different stews along with faux BBQ ribs that left me really full. Always nice to have a meal with so many different flavours all on one plate. Looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegan take-out places by far. I always buy from their booth at The Veg Food Fest and decided to finally check out their actual restaurant this year. Their food was even better than I remember. There are two sizes - $10 for the regular or $15 for the large. They're extremely generous with their portions so a large is more than enough for my boyfriend and I. I would also recommend going early because I have heard that they do run out quite quickly in the evenings."}
{"text":"Honestly this is one best vegan places I have ever been to.  Who there was such a thing as vegan Jamaican cuisine.  Now when you first see this place it looks shady on the outside but once you come in,the people are very nice and friendly and you get to choose a good mix of dishes that you can try.  They also make smoothies which I have yet to try.   If you are vegan or like vegan food and you've never set foot  it this place, what are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love meat, but I have lots of respect for vegan food. Good food is good food. This was some good food. I grabbed as many different flavours as so could (curry shrimp, callaloo, green beans, bbq, pasta) just to give a fair judgement. Everything was delicious, especially the curry shrimp and bbq. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Forgot to take a photo, but me and my mom brought home some food from here tonight! To be honest, my expectations were quite high due to the rave reviews and I wasn't too impressed. The food was good and fairly priced, but it wasn't anything special, despite the creative sounding plates. My mum got the bbq soy which was good and I got like a soy drumstick type thing bc I'm not into bbq sauce. Great portion size, but we agreed that we would have liked more protein. The sides took up a lot of the dish (they were good though). However, when my mum picked it up, she said that the people were really friendly and nice, so I would go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely floored! I am a proud carnivore, down to the bone. Was skeptical when I was referred here - but was very glad I did. I had the brown rice and peas and noodles, with pumpkin, chickpeas and beans, with tofu stir-fry and salad! lots of food for the price and does not make you feel 'heavy' afterwards. Already recommended it to my colleagues! Will be back for sure :)"}
