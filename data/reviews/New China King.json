{"text":"We have tried several dishes and have never been disappointed! Their Chow Mei Fun (Singapore) is my fav... Making it difficult to try new dishes.  Tonight we got adventurous with Green Curry Shrimp... A new fav! Check out their menu & trust your instincts!... \"10 min!\""}
{"text":"I will be back. Lunchtime Veg. Egg foo Young was very good.  Gravy had a deep enough flavor, not the flat taste of so many others and since gravy is packed separately I had as much as was needed. Three delicous patties to go with."}
{"text":"The food tastes fresh and hot, not all greasy like done other places. Fast delivery too and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend! The family that owns this restaurant works very hard and it shows in the cuisine they serve. I couldn't get enough of the sesame chicken! My only complaint is that the vegetable garnishes are broccoli, broccoli, and more broccoli. Would prefer maybe peppers and onions or really any other garnish. However, it comes in small enough quantities that it doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Quick delivery, great food, great prices. Its the only Chinese restaurant I order from. Potstickers are awesome, not to mention everything else. I have ordered from here multiple times and never been dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery this evening. Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef Lo Mein, Fried Crab Wontons, Wonton Soup. All in all, it cost about the same amount as it would've cost at China Express, which is my usual go-to Chinese delivery in Lakewood. But considering the rating similarities of these two restaurants on Yelp, I am really disappointed in the quality here. Nothing seems remotely fresh, the veggies were mush, everything that was fried was mush, the sweet and sour sauce was bright red-orange corn-syrupy flavorless-ness, the egg rolls were so salty they were inedible. I feel guilty for betraying my China Express (which seriously, isn't that great - but as far as Chinese delivery goes, it's yet to be topped.) I'm definitely not going back to New China King again."}
{"text":"This place is rock solid. my chinese food place of choice for sure! always quick delivery, cheap, and quality food for what it is.... would recommend to anyone looking for chinese food in the area, especially delivery."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed after all the reviews I read about this being the best Chinese food in Lakewood. If it is, I'm afraid to try the other restaurants. Thought the service was fast (delivery) and friendly, the food was both poor in quality and in taste. Fried rice seemed like something you'd buy out of the frozen food section and was greasy which was odd. The chicken was Average, my wonton soup had an odd flavor and was disappointing but I ate the won tons out of it because it was the best part out of all the food I ordered. My egg roll had a mysterious neon pink color meat that was finely ground up like taco bell meat and didn't really resemble a meat I am familiar with. Still not sure what it was. I took two bites and threw it away.   It's not often I take the time to write a review but I think the star rating and reviews on this place are too deceiving that I'm hoping maybe I could help spare another soul from a disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Very easy ordering process online. Quick delivery. Food was hot and tasty. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has the best vegetables!  The green curry tofu has water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, broccoli, pea pods, carrots, onions/leeks, green peppers, mushrooms and slices of small green squash(my favorite!) The green curry is a great warm spicy dish that you can't get at most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow - floored. I totally agree with Shayna B. Best Chinese takeout in Lakewood, and they DELIVER, with online ordering. Wonderful.  Everything tasted fresh and really, really good!  The egg rolls were a tad spicy - almost like there was wasabi inside. Very unique. I did enjoy the wonton soup even though the wontons were more \"delicate\" than those I usually prefer. Everything was flavorful without being over the top. I'm really impressed."}
{"text":"Ok, first time ordering here today. Here are my pros and cons.  Pros: Fast delivery service & online ordering - super easy! Love that I can order a small  or large size portion of some dishes The house special soup was very yummy and packed full of veggies The szechuan shrimp was very flavorful although an odd bright orange color  Cons: The kung pao beef I got was a little bland and the meat was tough Because I ordered online i got to use one of their coupons which was great BUT the cream cheese wontons were not good at all.   SO overall I love that I can have this delivered super fast (legit 15 min) and can try multiple dishes in a smaller portion size. I will definitely order here again but with the understanding that some dishes can be either hit or miss."}
{"text":"Not recommended for delivery. Second time I have tried them in two months, and I will not try them again. Unpleasant asian delivery person. Called the store and yells at them in Chinese so loud the neighbors heard him. Food was over cooked. Not much else to say. Not a good experience. I am an easy one to please, and I prefer to be kind. So maybe two stars is as kind as I can be."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery. The service was very prompt, much quicker than the advertised time. The food was excellent. Fresh and cooked very well. Plus everything arrived hot.   We ordered the Mongolian Chicken, which was just spicy enough and packed with great fresh vegetables and moist chicken. The Crab Meat Fried Wontons were quite good. The wonton soup was very well seasoned. The General Tso's Tofu was very good with a tangy and spicy sauce.   New China King is a great new place in Lakewood and we are looking forward to ordering from them again, especially since they have an online system. A huge plus in our book!"}
{"text":"I have always done pickup at this place. There is always plenty of parking to pick it up. Reasonable prices and really good food! It's one of the best in Cleveland (on the west side of downtown). Rating is based on 2 stars for food, 1 star for consistency in timing/service, 1 for parking, and 1 for reasonableness of the pricing."}
{"text":"Really good egg roles and general Tsao. We were very happy with everything. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place dozens of times. Usually it takes about an hour, which is whatever, but this last order was just all wrong. I waiting an hour an 15 minutes. Okay. But when it finally came it was a completely wrong order. Like it was literally someone else's order. I called in, they called the driver and told them to turn around, and they gave me a 5% discount on my next order. Really. 5%. I said okay okay. Whatever. Then once we got our order one of our sides wasn't there. Dat shit cray. Not cool man. Not cool. I don't even want to redeem my 5 whole % discount."}
{"text":"Really great food that we all enjoyed.   The fact that they will deliver to Westlake was really appreciated since we all were sick!  Online ordering is a breeze.   We will order from them again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst experience I've ever had from a Chinese restaurant. I ordered multiple things as I was in the sampling mood. The boneless ribs were gross(tasted nothing like a rib and was died bright red). The bourbon chicken had no flavor. The pepper steak was very, very runny and watered down. The beef chow mein was also very, very watery and slimy. The general Tso's chicken was very mushy and I'm not 100% sure it was chicken. The sesame chicken tasted so bad that I threw it away after the first bite. The egg roll was dried out and tasted like they made it a couple of days ago. The chicken lo mein tasted ok, however the best item I received today was the fortune cookie. Very, very disappointed!! Unfortunately I threw 95% of this food away. What a waste of food and money. And if that's not enough after a $10 prepaid tip the driver would not deliver to my hotel room. Had to meet him in the lobby. Needless to say I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"It was only $1 for delivery and food brought to my apartment in 15-20 mins after ordering. Hot, fresh, tasty. Loved the \"house soup\""}
{"text":"This has become our go to Chinese take out restaurant in Lakewood. We love their pot stickers and curry dishes. The hot and sour soup is also great. If you want consistent affordable Chinese take out you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Love that they have online ordering and a great selection. We chose them because they have boneless ribs which my son loves. Their crab rangoon was excellent. Egg rolls were average. I've never had kung pao where the chicken was fried and I didn't care for it that way. The lo mein was good. The fried rice was average at best. My son enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the boneless ribs.  The part that really disappointed me was picking up my food and someone was smoking inside or blowing smoke into the restaurant. When I first tasted the bonless ribs, you could taste the cigarettes which grossed me out. Smoking is NOT allowed inside establishments for a reason--especially so close to where the food is being prepared."}
{"text":"Food was great! Crab Rangoons were amazing and the food to just the amount of time the staff estimated."}
{"text":"This place has the best service out of any Chinese take out place I've ever delt with. Super friendly and they always repeat your order back to make sure it is correct. I give it 4 stars because I have had a few not so good dinners, but it was the cook not the service. If you're looking for good take out I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be chicken chow main. It has a sticky clear creamy sauce. I couldn't even bring myself to taste it. Plus why is the chicken white, almost opaque?  I did eat the rice and egg roll which were decent."}
{"text":"Since recently moving from miami I have been searching for good Chinese food. Unfortunately, this place was ok but I wouldn't eat here again. I ordered beef and broccoli, shrimp egg roll, and lo mien. I threw out the egg roll since it tasted spoiled. The other dishes were mediocre. Overall, this is not becoming my go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good Chinese place in Cleveland for quite some time now and I think I finally found a good one. I had veg lo mein and crab ragoons and loved them both!"}
{"text":"I keep ordering the soup here for lunch.  Super inexpensive and totally perfect.   Our favorite Chinese delivery spot in lakewood so far."}
{"text":"As part of my never-ending search for cheap Chinese takeout that's acceptable and includes decent Hunan-style selections (I'm very picky about my Hunan), I tried New China King.  First off, I like their on-line ordering system very much; easy to use and you get a confirmation emailed back.  The place is one of the ubiquitous hole-in-the-wall spots with just a couple of tables so you have a place to wait for your order if you're early.  My order, dinner for two with some fried pot stickers on the side was ready on time shortly after I got there.  The menu is pretty varied and includes a lot of choices that aren't on the typical cheap Chinese list.  Dinner for two at $18.98 is a good value since you get won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice for two along with any two entrees priced under $9.75 each, which covers a lot more items than the typical dinner for two choice list.  Most of the menu choices meet the price limit with the exception of those in the seafood and specialty section, so you really get a good number to choose from.    The food:  I ordered Hunan Beef for me and Lemon Chicken for my wife.  The beef was lean and tender, and was very plentiful and came with nice crispy vegetables (baby corn, water chestnuts, broccoli, green pepper, onions, mushrooms and a bit of carrot.  The sauce was not sweet (I hate sweet Hunan sauce).  I prefer mine a little greasier (House of Hunan in Fairlawn's sauce is the gold standard); however New King's is acceptable.  My wife's lemon chicken was OK for her; she makes what I think is terrific lemon chicken so I've never been inclined to order it; however she wanted to compare hers.  Totally different, so there's really no way to say how it compares with other restaurants' and frankly most don't even have it.  She liked the crispness of the broccoli that comes with it.  The won ton soup was alright, the broth was good with scallions and nice thin-skinned stuffed won tons, but no pork or bok choy.  The egg rolls were nothing special, although they were nicely fried and not greasy.  The pot stickers were really good.  The fried rice was decent as well, much better than the stuff you get sometimes that's just brown colored with no vegetables.  It would have been much better if they had thrown a few chunks of pork in.  All in all it was a good value and a good experience.  You get tons of food, including 2 separate pints of soup and fried rice, so apart from the egg rolls, everything is packaged per person.  I plan to try their lunch specials very soon because again, they have a big selection of items AND hot & sour soup is one choice (I love me some good hot & sour soup).  New China King is a keeper for me!  P.S., I don't usually do delivery so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese take out in lakewood. I got the sesame tofu and it was really good! Even though the sesame tofu was really good ... I would've liked a little more broccoli & sauce. My husband says the dumplings are delicious."}
{"text":"Not understanding the rave reviews.  Delivery took an hour after being quoted 15 mins, my general tso didn't come with any veggies, and it was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Ugh unfortunately my experience tonight will never leave my mind. I've ordered from here about 5x and never had anything bad, but tonight we ordered delivery. My sesame chicken had a HUGE thick and long black hair in the food. I threw the food out and still feel sick. Never again !!"}
{"text":"Their food is great, they deliver and you can order online. Dumplings are very good. Everything we have tried has been very good."}
{"text":"The go to Chinese food. Love this place. Not very greasy like some Chinese places. Food always takes under 15 minutes and is always delicious."}
{"text":"All I can say about New China King is It's a takeout Chinese place and the food is good. Prices are also very good, better than other places in the area. Last time I ordered pickup and they forgot one side of rice. We called and they sent a delivery guy out with it right away!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out veggie chow mein and just got a puddle of vegetables instead. Ordered brown sauce veggie side dish and got the blandest tasting veggies in a watery-flavorless sauce. Sorry, but please double check order before packaging"}
{"text":"Updated Review: Tried New China King again and we upped rating from 4 to 5.  By far freshest and the best Chinese food in Lakewood.  Broccoli super fresh and not overcooked, tofu dish perfectly prepared.  Last time we thought things requested hot spice barely any heat but this time hot was perfect!  They even have some free items when you order a certain $ amount online which is such a nice extra -- we got the crab rangoon which was excellent -- crisp, not greasy at all, delish.  Love the convenience of online ordering and the delivery to our door.  And for those commenting on the misspellings, yep it is true but don't let that cause you miss out on quality Chinese food.  So glad to have this addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"OMG this place is very good!  We like that they have entrees that traditional \"chinese\" restaurants don't have.  For example, their dumplings are outstanding!  As good as what they make in Chinatown, downtown, at Wonton Gourmet, Li Wah or Siam Cafe.  Order the pork/shrimp dumplings.  Awesome.  We also ordered the green curry mixed combo that comes with chicken/shrimp/beef.  Very tasty and not what you'd expect from a typical Chinese restaurant.  Order the fried scallop appetizer also, very good. We tend to judge on meat portion, which is very good.  Everything was excellent and vthe veggies are bright, crisp and tasty too.  We are so happy that this place has had some sort of grand re-opening.  We've ordered from here 3 times in 2 weeks and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"best General Tso chicken in Lakewood!Spring rolls were great as well, very fresh. The hot and sour soup has an awesome broth but did find it to be pretty chunky. The sauce is sweet and has a mild kick. Online ordering is the best thing to come to Chinese take out! Definitely looking forward to trying again."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese delivery we have ever had. The orange chicken is great. The lady is very nice when you call. We order from here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed. The food always arrives pretty quickly and the delivery guy is friendly. This is the only place in Lakewood I would get Chinese from."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place, but I've ordered from it a handful of times and it has not let me down. You can order online and not talk to any humans, which is a big plus for me, and the food has always arrived within half an hour for me. Overall, its not mind-blowing food, but its pretty dang tasty. I'm a big fan of the crab rangoon (its light and crispy- not over fried and the filling is delicious), the garlic broccoli, and the lo mien. Its not my favorite eggroll, but plenty of their other apps are tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for take out and my boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken.  He said it was the best Orange Chicken he has had from a Fast food Chinese restaurant.  There were actual pieces of orange peel-so we knew it was legit.  I ordered the Curry Chicken, and the flavor was delicious, however way too many onions dominated the dish.  Service was really quick and friendly too, only had to wait 10 minutes.  Heard the dumplings were really good so we'll definitely be back =)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, online ordering AND delivery. My favorites are their lo mein, shrimp egg roll and definitely their sesame chicken. Yum."}
{"text":"Food tasted like it was old and super salty.  The teriyaki beef was super small for what you pay for.  The wonton was super thin and fell apart as I was trying to eat them!  The driver drove up to the house blasting gangster rap and blocked the neighbors driveway, preventing her from getting in.  Will not buy from again.  Many other choices in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. This time around we ordered the Dinner for Two from the Family Dinner Special online. Two entrees, two wonton soups, 2 egg-rolls and 2 fried rice for $18.99. Couldn't beat that! I also ordered the pot stickers with chive and they were amazing! I was really happy that I got to order online while I was working and my husband could stop on his way home work and pick it up! I could even make notes on my order, like 'Veggie egg-rolls only. Seafood allergy'. Pretty excited we gave these guys a shot and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible \"food\".  Ordered many many times in the past.  Unfortunately the quality of food changed to very poor and we won't order again.  Received the sesame chicken and the chicken was missing from inside the breading!  When I cut into the chicken it was just a puff of air with a lining of fluff along the inside edges.  This is not real meat and even lower quality than what you get at McDonald's (at least McDonalds serves chicken nuggets that contain chicken!!!). I could not even eat the sesame chicken delivered and given a good cash tip!!! It was just a waste of $25. The wonton soup tasted like perfume too!  Spring roll is fried just like the egg roll. Very disappointed. TOTALLY INEDIBLE!!! RUN AWAY FOM THIS PLACE - IGNORE HISTORICAL REVIEWS THEY POOR QUALITY NOW!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Fast delivery & of course really good orange chicken!"}
{"text":"First time here. Best egg rolls I've had in a long time! I am not local to Lakewood but I will be coming back just for the egg rolls!! Fried rice was pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite and go-to place when I'm craving Chinese. My boyfriend and I usually go for the meal for two that comes with two entrees with rice, 2 egg rolls, and 2 soups. It's an absurd amount of food and is so cheap! I usually go for the general tsos chicken and I love it. We've also tried the beef and broccoli and another entree that had peanuts in it that I can't remember the name of. But everything I've tried from here is delicious and the portions are huge. One entree alone lasts me for 3-4 meals. We've always picked up, so I can't speak for delivery times. Whenever we go, they seem busy with orders and deliveries. I wouldn't say it's a place to go and sit down and eat. There are two tables and it's very loud and crates inside. If you're looking for Chinese food in/near Lakewood, make sure you try New China King!"}
{"text":"Standard Chinese takeout but it's delicious! I've had several different meals off of the menu and they never disappoint. I do get kind of picky with crab rangoon because some restaurants don't make it well but this place has it spot on. The food is always hot, delicious, well prepared, and made quickly. Also the staff is always very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with New China King was extremely lackluster and we won't be returning. The husband ordered General Tso's Chicken that he said wasn't great. I ordered Veg Lo Mein and Mixed Vegetables w/ Brown Sauce. Both were REALLY lacking in flavor and the lo mein had few vegetables. I absolutely hate wasting food, and we ended up throwing out a LOT of food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that delivered food to my house I didn't expect for them to deliver to me since I don't live in Lakewood but I was so surprised that they did. The general Tso chicken was amazing, the ribs were awesome And the portions were big. I have ordered twice and this is my go to place when I want some Chinese food delivery!"}
{"text":"This is classic Chinese American take out and viewed through that lens, one of the best around. I swear the potstickers are homemade. Never had better except in my kitchen. Yes, it's salty and greasy, but in the best way possible. We order delivery regularly and they are always timely and the food is hot. Solid General Tso's and egg rolls, but the potstickers are the highlight!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese in the Lakewood area. Ordering online is a bit wonky, but that's pretty normal for a Chinese restaurant. There are just multiples of everything all over the place. If there are two of you, get the special. It is a TON of food for the money. THe food was ready in about 10 minutes, which is longer than it took me to go pick it up. They also deliver.   I say it's the best because it had the only General Tso's I've had in Lakewood that wasn't soupy or basically just sesame chicken, it actually had some spicey-ness to it. I haven't had much else from them, but I will be back when I have a craving."}
{"text":"Prices are really affordable, however you get what you pay for. Ordered Chicken Chow Mein which had no Chow Mein noodles. The chicken looked very pale and the dish was very watery and unappetizing. Delivery came at a reasonable time but when I saw my dish and expressed my disappointment, the employee on the phone had told me, \"That is what you ordered.\" Bottom line- affordable but definitely a gamble I would not take again."}
{"text":"This is the best Americanized Chinese we've had in the area. And they deliver.  We ordered spring rolls, fried crab & cheese wontons, pork & chive pot stickers, chicken w garlic sauce, egg rolls, wonton soup, and sweet donuts, for delivery, for $25!  The wonton soup was the only thing that I didn't love.  Everything was hot, delivery was fast, good portions, great quality, and an awesome price.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered Sunday and the food was pretty good and the crab rangoon is the best I've ever had. Order again 4 days later and the food is cold, didn't get the correct items, and the lemon chicken is two small chicken breasts deep fried with a mushy crust placed in a container with broccoli and a container of lemon sugar water on the side to pour on it. I'll give them one more chance but for now I have to leave it in the middle."}
