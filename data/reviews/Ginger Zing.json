{"text":"One of the best in the valley, price very reasonable, service great, but it's the food that always have me coming back for more, love the Kung pow and fried rice just to name a few, the lettuce wraps are low key meta, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered a lot for take home and ended up lacking some of our food.called them to let them know that some of our orders were missing and the guy on the phone said that we cannot get it unless we make another transaction."}
{"text":"Their Mandarin Chicken is delicious! My son and I love it and order it quite often. I've never dined in, we usually order for delivery, but that dish is definitely work trying and is really good especially if you order the spicy option. No complaints from me, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tried for quite a while to place an order for food from this place but it kept telling me they were closed, but their website says they are open until 9?? Not COOL! Especially since they hung up on me without answering when I tried to call! I will NEVER order from this place!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that my friends recommend Ginger Zing.   We stopped by the other day and really enjoyed the food. Great mouth watering dishes. Everything was fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the food from here. It's excellent quality and the meals are self contained.  They come with white rice on the left side of the container and the meat, in my case, or shrimp, is on the right. Very convenient to eat and not messy. It's rather pricey when you realize that you never have any leftovers being served this way. They deliver less food, but it's priced like their competitors who deliver in many cases, much more food. I live alone so leftovers aren't that big a deal with me anymore. But do understand they are being quite clever in how they get away with managing their food costs. You do get 1 excellent meal, just no leftovers per se"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Carmel Chicken for the win! Try it and you won't regret. Fast service and your Chinese fix."}
{"text":"I had a menu on my door and called to place an order.. Should be open til 10, was told they are closed. Dismissed."}
{"text":"Amazing fried rice along with orange chicken. This is our second time ordering this week and that's very rare because my wife isn't a fan of Chinese. It was her idea to go with Chinese."}
{"text":"Low quality Chinese food. Vegetable lo main was literally just noodles & onions, no other veggies. Greasy and gross"}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai is well prepared, Orange Chicken is amazing. Better off picking up to ensure freshness, delivery can take a long time due to the new popularity."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food. Fresh and yummy. I get the kung pao every time and it has been consistently good every time. Bonus no weird meat."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The new management has just bumped this place up for me! Authentic Chinese food, good service, clean, and my go to! Got the Singaporean noodles and cheese puffs last time- sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Thanks for the gr8 delivery meal. Fresh, hot on arrival and friendly staff. Thanks again..."}
{"text":"Found this place near by my house, absolutely love it! Tried the Thai coconut Curry chicken and felt in love with it! Also ordered the Mongolian Beef, Great taste and Great portion!"}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing. I went in with my crying 3 year old, and they were so kind when taking my order. While waiting for my order, this sweet lady who worked in the back brought my daughter a treat. For this type of customer service they deserve 10 stars in my opinion. 
The food was great! Not the typical greasy Asian take out. Plus, I heard its under new management.  So disregard old posts. 
The food was fresh and great tasting. Loved, loved the Hawaiian Carmel. Place is clean too (added bonus). 
 I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, the food was fresh and the taste was on point. Will be coming back soon !"}
{"text":"Found this place while doing Uber eats. I will never go to another Asian food establishment again! The orange chicken, honey sesame and sweet and sour chicken are amazing. The staff is so friendly and inviting they make you want to keep coming back!! Oh and the donuts!! Omg so good!!"}
{"text":"Wow I've had very few times where the food was unedible this is one of those places I had Thai pad it was horrible noodles are slimy have ate 4 pieces of shrimp and probably a cup of whole peanuts no flavor at all made my stomach hurt a bro have there sesame chicken that was horrible too will overcooked maybe burn and how do you mess up fried rice gross only thing that was good was our chicken egg roll which were probably Frozen that's why they tasted good got the counter was nice but obviously no one there and you had a cook definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had in a very 
Long time. Great portions as well. Their prices are great!! Really love the shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"Every single time I order a tofu entree it is always dry, chewy, over cooked, they never have enough sauce, and the ratio of tofu to vegetables is always off. The couple shrimp entrees I have tried were decent despite the lack of vegetables. I still can't understand how an Asian restaurant can mess up tofu so badly when it's one of their main entree items."}
{"text":"This place is located on Southern and Val Vista Dr. it's a really nice location next to a pet grooming and dollar tree store. When I went in for the first time the service was fantastic! They had us sit down and the server right away asked us what we wanted to drink and gave us time to look over the menu. I got the honey sesame chicken with a side of fried rice. 
The chicken was crispy on the outside and the sauce was very delicious! The fried rice had a lot of soy sauce in it which made it a little too salty but it was still very delicious! 
The people there are so friendly and they definitely made us welcome!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Fabulous Chinese place to eat for years! This place is soooo good! They cook it fresh when ordered. The portions are great too! We are having lunch tomorrow with the leftovers. Our first time here and we got the Honey Sesame Chicken and Hawaiian Caramel. They both had the perfect amount of flavor. 
Service was exceptional too! Quick to take our order and out the leftovers in the packaging for us. Yes!!!!
We have now made this our go to place after baseball!"}
{"text":"I usually get this place delivered because the one time I went the tables were packed. I prefer eating in front of my tv watching my favorite shows since I'm so tired after work. 

Each time I get my delivery, the food has always been consistent and quick. 

A+ for food quality. Love that they deliver so quick!"}
{"text":"Wow! We ordered a bit of everything and it was all AMAZING! Firecracker chicken, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, lo mein, cheese puffs! ALL of these were tasty! By far the BEST take out/delivery we have ever had. Fresh, not oily at all. I honestly can't say enough good things or put in words how perfect our food is. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh and delicious food! Got my orange chicken, Hawaiian Carmel chicken and egg rolls delivered. They are tasty! Love the food! Recommend to try! We will try more other entrees next time."}
{"text":"Panda who? This is it for us. Came in for the first time and it was all deliciously fresh. Portions are generous ( we had enough to take home). Try the Hawaiian beef or else!Â°"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I love that they have a vegan option for everything on their menu. I will definitely be going back. Friendly service. Clean restaurant. My new favorite."}
{"text":"I've tried alot of local mesa Chinese restaurants,  this is by far the best quality,  great delivery!!"}
{"text":"I love a good Mom n Pop restaurant and these guys are fantastic! They are super warm and inviting when you enter and make you feel like family. The crispy beef is my absolute favorite but they have some pretty delicious chicken options as well. Perfect for lunch time or take out for dinner. 

Give em a try!"}
{"text":"Ginger Zing! My new favorite Chinese delivery joint. The Chinese food arrives piping hot, with an awesome aroma in just 20-45 minutes. They have a special where you can get 3 entrees for $21 bucks which includes brown or white rice, or fried rice for a small additional charge.  Which is great for people that want a little bit of everything, or for those that are a little indecisive.  

I strongly recommend their over stuff, flavorful cheese puffs as an appetizer.  My significant other loves by far their chicken fried rice. My preference is the Hawaiian caramel beef, orange chicken, and Thai curry coconut beef.  The food is amazingly fresh, delicious and very well priced for the portions you receive. We always have leftovers for the next day.

Looking for a date night in, to enjoy a good Netflix and some grub, this is the place to go, their fast friendly staff will take care of you.  Give em a try.  I don't think they will let you down. ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! This was our 1st time eating food from Ginger ZING and will not be our last! So good!! The delivery driver was very nice too! This is our new favorite Asian restaurant. ..will be ordering again soon! Pad thai,teriyaki chicken and honey sesame chicken all wonderful!!! You should try it! A+"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple friends and service was friendly and fast! We ordered Hawaiian caramel beef, honey sesame chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce. The dishes were ALL DELICIOUS! The shrimp was large and fresh. The fried chicken and beef were crispy and saucy at the same time yet the meat was still tender. They know what they're doing. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked. Was delivered on time, we got 10% off because it was our first order. They even threw in a free dessert. My dish was ninja tofu which was so good! The fried rice is delicious. The portions are great. Me and my boyfriend shared different dishes because it was a lot of food, and for a great price. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional! Wow the food is absolutely fantastic and the service is even better!We've been looking for a good restaurant for Asian food our past few seasons here in the Mesa area and finally hit the jackpot when we found this place! It is our new \"go to\" for quality Asian entrees!! We LOVED our chef, \"yang\" in the kitchen and her knowledgeable, helpful, patient son was out server.  Excellent!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and walked here for dinner one night. Service was great, our waiter made us laugh a lot. We shared the ginger garlic shrimp and yellow curry with beef. They allowed us to add broccoli to each meal. The shrimp was so flavorful my husband actually enjoyed mine more than his. The curry was a really nice balance of flavor and spice. We booth had enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Excellent! The hot and sour soup and Kung pao chicken were the best I've ever had! Food was hot and fresh and service was great. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the ninja chicken. Wow. Egg rolls are awesome too. Very fast delivery. You won't regret a quick lunch from here."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a few times and finally got around to trying it today. To be honest I didn't expect a whole lot... But was pleasantly surprised. While it's no fine dining the food is priced well,  large portions and everything I tried was very tasty. The fried rice was seasoned well and everything was really yummy.  I sampled 3 dishes... The Kung pao beef,  Hawaiian caramel beef & the Sriracha basil chicken. I'll be doing it again when the desire for quick Chinese food strikes my mood."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and excellent orange chicken!   Very easy to order and steaming hot! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"In Mesa, there isn't many amazing Chinese food places to pick from but after reading the reviews, I decided why not.

This place is clean when you walk in.  And the staff that works there were very friendly and they were all smiles to each other!  

I got my usual at any Chinese restaurant, the Veggie Lo Mein.  I had my order to go and when I picked it up, I knew that these people didn't mess around-it felt like a brick in weight!  When I finally got home to put the food in my belly, I was pleasantly surprised on how fresh it was.  Nothing oily or heavy like in some placed but the flavours were just clean and the veggies were crisp!  I have tons of left over, which I am soooo happy for and cannot wait to eat it!

I will for sure be back and next time with back up to help devour this amazing food!  I'm just bummed I didn't know of this place sooner but hey better late then never!"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from this restaurant multiple times a week in some weeks.  This food is that good.  The sweet and sour sauce is amazing and they have the most amazing fried rice.  I would highly recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have ever had.  The place is small, must do more take out and delivery.  We had cheese puffs, spring rolls and the teriyaki ninja beef.  The beef was amazing.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Ginger Zing is AMAZING! I love their food. I have been trying several different dishes and haven't come across one yet that I haven't liked. It's become my go-to place for Chinese food and I just haven't had the desire to go anywhere else. Their Hawaiian Carmel Chicken was so good and it was hard to order anything different but I'm glad I did because each dish is just as good. The General Tso's Chicken is excellent (having it tonight!) as well as the Orange Beef and the Singapore Noodles with pork (probably one of my favorites). I am not a spicy food lover when it comes to Asian food so I order the Singapore Noodles mild. The first time I ordered it without saying and it was a little too much for me, I know I'm a whimp. The next time it was just right and I ordered it between no spice and just a little. I liked that better. They can vary the hot degree pretty accurately. The food is high quality and I've never had any issues whatsoever. They've never forgotten anything in my order and it's been made perfectly correct each time for me and my family. The staff is really friendly and helpful. This place will serve you if you eat there, have it ready for pickup (in very nice containers) or have it delivered. We usually do pick up. The website is easy to navigate and very informative. I'm happy I found this place because I'm pretty picky about Chinese food and I've found one that meets my likes or should I say loves."}
{"text":"We were looking for our old favorite China Gourmet ( we're winter visitors ) and found when we called we got Ginger Zing instead. No problem, placed and order for delivery. Order arrived very quickly but not like their predecessors for sure. Food was... Meh. Passable but portions significantly smaller and not nearly as tasty. Too bad, so sad."}
{"text":"Soup was good. But something about General Tso's Chicken & fried rice gave me the worst case of gas & twisted stomach. I'm home sick."}
{"text":"Just finished my first meal from here. Ordered online and had it delivered. This place is absolutely amazing. I had the orange chicken double spicy with fried rice. The flavor and portions are huge. I have left overs for lunch tomorrow. I would recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Ginger Zing is now my new favorite Chinese food joint. Their food is fresh, delicious, and not expensive at all. The workers are so welcoming, you can tell they love being there. I'm making it my goal to try everything on their menu, it's THAT good. Do not hesitate to try Ginger Zing."}
{"text":"This place is great for delivery. They were very fast and friendly. The food was excellent and still warm. We had the orange chicken and the the chicken peanut thai. All ingredients were fresh and great flavor. Also the fried rice was just like we like it all very fresh and tasty. We highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing Asian food I've had! Extremely good, not too spicy, as well as extremely affordable! Pad Thai was just a teeny bit dry, but that is my only complaint! Thanks so much, Ginger Zing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"GZ is our go-to Chinese restaurant. Always, fresh, hot and delicious! I love the tender beef Bankok fried rice and the sesame chicken while the hubs orders the teriyaki chicken (fyi: is battered and fried, which is different but good). We order for delivery usually and it always arrives hot, correct and on time. Two thumbs way up!!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thia in town. It was served very hot and delicious. The new owners are very professional and cater to all your needs. The place is newly renovated. Cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"So I just happened to walk by this place but am I glad I did! The honey sesame chicken is unreal! So good. Super crispy and delicious flavor, not drenched too heavily in sauce and fresh! I ordered a side of steamed veggies and they gave me a huge portion. They should have a side order because this is big enough for two. I will be coming back, if just for this chicken. 

More casual fast food, way fresher and tastier than a panda option. My meal with a drink was around $11.00 but I will have leftovers."}
{"text":"LoveLoveLove!
Their Pad Thai is crazy good! I keep meaning to try other things when I come here but I always brake down and get the Pad Thai with beef, extra lime. My boyfriend always gets something different and I haven't kept track, but he has always been happy with it. Today he got the Firecracker chicken (which I tried and was quite good and very fresh) 
We also tried the spring rolls...
Gotta say: EXCELLENT. And they came with a really yummy sweet chili sauce I've never had with spring rolls before. 
There's always a friendly face behind the counter. 
The food is always delicious. 
Ginger Zing = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in Phoenix area. Generals chicken is excellent. Reminds me of east coast sesame chicken.  Low Mein is great too.  Order noodles instead of rice and you get a sizable portion of low Mein.  Places is always busy because it's damn good. A+ staff."}
{"text":"Having the opportunity to eat at many Asian eateries in the Mesa area, Ginger Zing is now one of my favorites. I wouldn't generally give a fast food establishment 5 stars however, Ginger Zing deserves the rating. This restaurant will be here for the forseable future. The dishes are well prepared and the store is kept pristine. Teriyaki Chicken and Hawaiian Carmel beef were outstanding. The Hot and Sour soup was just that and would have served as a lunch meal all on its own. The Shrimp fried rice and Chicken LoMein I took home and were quickly devoured by the kids. Yes we will return and I am excited that a great option for Asian delivery is now available  in my area..which by the way is inundated with poor delivery food.."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've ever had! The batter on chicken is crunchy, sauce has the perfect amount of heat. Husband had sweet and sour chicken and loved it. Fried rice great, chicken egg rolls great! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN MY AREA!!!! 
I highly recommend the lettuce wraps! They changed the recipe to a more healthier recipe and it is TO DIE FOR. 
I also really enjoyed the hawaiian caramel chicken plate and the mandarin orange chicken plate!

I WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!!! 
HOLY YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food.  Great delivery service and very nice people working there.  I only see from them several times a month"}
{"text":"Affordable, big portions, speedy delivery and freakin delicious to boot. Ordered Orange Chicken, Lo Mein and Firecracker Beef.   I've been searching for a Chinese delivery close to home and I've found it! Thanks Ginger Zing- you got a life long customer in me! Can't wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I have try all the items on their menu. I only had the Pad Thai. Since it was a Asian fusion take-out place I didn't expected the Pad Thai to taste as authentic as if you were to order from on a Thai restaurant. The Pad Tai was surprisingly good. The worker there was nice and courteous, unlike most Chinese restaurant. I would give this place a 5 , but the only one this I didn't like was that the restroom was all the way to the back of the kitchen. I'm not sure if they were so kind as to let me use their employees restroom or if it's was restroom for customers as well. I just felt nervous going through the kitchen. It felt like I was intruding their work area. I guess if you are not as sensitive as I it would not bother you. Lastly, This is a take out delivery restaurant so it was not set up for convenience for dine in customers."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The fried rice looked more like white rice with soy sauce on it. It is not authentic, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Still stuck at home I ordered Ginger Z delivery with Yelp app and it worked out great. I ordered Double Spicy Tofu and Orange Chicken. With Tip I spent $25 and it was delivered quickly. This is far better than chain Asian food I have had with a explosion of flavors and correct texture.  Best Chinese food I have had in AZ so far."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurants. The orange chicken and the honey sesame chicken are awesome. The fried wontons are great too. They are always on time or early and my order has always been correct. Not a huge fan of the fried rice but everything else has been wonderful. I love being able to order on Yelp as well."}
{"text":"Nothing but delicious food at Ginger Zing! I have ordered from them a few times. Delivery is fast and my food is still warm. 

If you dine in, their space is small... Maybe 6 tables. The staff is friendly and helpful. 

The egg drop soup is so good!"}
{"text":"The sevice was great and the food was delicious!   This place is family run, and the food and atmosphere reflect it.  Note: If you like spicy food make sure to ask for it to be made spicier."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly very good! We live one minute from here and thought we'd check it out! This is a small take out Asian food restaurant, with a great combo of Chinese, Thai and Japanese food. We had the Mongolian chicken and Kung Pao chicken and both were so good! For Asian cheap eats, this place ranks high on flavor and quality. The service is friendly and the place is very clean and uncluttered with 3 small tables for a quick eat and go, otherwise take out. Don't miss this place! It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Worst oriental food I've had.
Expensive too.
Only one oriental looking guy working there. 
The veggie noodles I got were not good. Hardly no veggies in it. Noodles were very thick and had a weird bland taste. I had to soak it with soy sauce just so I could eat it.
My hubby asked for a side of white rice and they wanted 6.99 for it. So hubby declined.
Soup was good."}
{"text":"Such a good little hidden gem! Loved my food!!! So glad this is by my house  I ordered the coconut curry and it was the perfect amount of spicy. I paired it with the best tofu I've had in a while, way better then pie wei."}
{"text":"Large quantities and good food. Fed 4 of us for about $40 (2 entrees, 2 kids meals, and 2 appetizers), and had plenty leftover. The food is better quality than any other similar type restaurants, with fresh veggies and not super greasy. Would certainly recommend giving this place a try"}
{"text":"So this place recently went under new management. Admittedly I never ate here prior to the switch but my friend Jared raved about this place and forced me to give a shot. SO GLAD I DID. I absolutely LOVE their dumplings, I could literally eat them every single day. I also love their sweet and sour chicken and the chicken lo mein. (My picky 2 yo son loves the lo mein too which is awesome!) Their portions are all large, so I'm always able to stretch out the meals for 2-3 days depending on how much I order. Which is great for me since I'm a mom on a budget. I love leftovers!! Definitely give this place a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food tastes pretty great! Less greasy than Panda Express. The delivery time was quick. They employee delivering was nice too! 

Food tastes good. I had the sesame chicken and fried rice. The rice tasted a bit different but it was bad. However, the sesame chicken tasted very good! I'd like more chicken in there though. They give a good portion for a decent price. I'd eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Asian Chinese food that's fresh and fast. 

This small hole in the wall place is tucked inside the plaza next to an escape room. The interior is a little modern with a few tables to sit. 

The menu ranges from American well known dishes such as kung pow chicken to more traditional Singapore rice noodles. I usually opt in for more traditional plates. 

The Singapore rice noodles with bbq pork was served as a really good size portion. It's spicy which I liked. The texture was good and nothing was hard nor chewy. 

I also got the Asian donuts which I haven't eaten in a long time and at first bite it reminded me of my childhood memories. 

Overall I had a great experience. I prefer these mom and pop shops over the franchises that serve more non traditional dishes and sometimes even frozen food."}
{"text":"Love Ginger Zing! We just moved to the area and found a flyer on our front gate from them. They were offering 3 entrees for $21 so we thought we'd give them a try. Not only was it a great deal, the food was awesome too! The Hawaiian Carmel Chicken was definitely the favorite! We also ordered the Sriracha Basil Chicken and the Honey Sesame Chicken. They were really good too! They're definitely going to be our go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"Ordered the *new* General Tsao's chicken, triple spicy. Expected it to be pretty spicy, sadly it was not. It was however pretty good for General Tsao's. That's said, listing your items as mild, medium, double spicy, and triple spicy, you'd expect triple spicy to be spicy. Or have any spice at all. If you like the flavor of general tsao and are thinking about ordering here, do it. It's good. Portion size is decent for what you pay. Just don't expect it to be spicy if your used to really spicy food."}
{"text":"Finally something good on this side of the valley!  Geared for takeout more than sit down but the staff was very accommodating. Food was very good."}
{"text":"New to town, spent a lomg day house shopping and exploring. Beat. Was hoping for \"tolerable\" delivery so we could be lazy and full. An hour later we had not only received our meals but devoured them. Delivery was reasonably fast. Prices were fair, food was far above expectations. I hope our previous Chinese food supplier does not read this, because these meals were far better than the really good food we used to eat back home. Not greasy, rice is fresh, chicken was tasty and fresh. Feel really lucky to find this on our first try!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had this place twice and both times were great. My husband and I had their fried rice, cheese puffs, and egg rolls. The establishment is very clean with friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is about delivery and food that was delivered.

We had their door advertisement coupon for the ginger madness meal deal for 22$
2 entrees, 3 egg rolls and 2ltr pop
We also ordered dumplings and another entree.

Egg rolls where way over cooked almost like they had been sitting around and to make then cripsy again they refried them.

Crispy dumplings where stale and luke warm like they had been sitting around for a while.

Sesame chicken doughy and was way over cooked 

The ginger broccoli beef had NO ginger in it.  They need to rename it back to just broccoli beef.

He also forgot our pop and had to go back for it.

Was charged a delivery fee even though their door advertisement does not state that you have to pay a delivery charge it just says 15$ minimum and our order was over 38$.

I would NOT recommend delivery!"}
{"text":"The honey sesame chicken was really good. I also ordered egg drop soup that was a little salty. Overall I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Staff was super friendly and attentive. My 7 year old says they should get 20 stars.

My wife had the general tso chicken which she liked but not as much as my son's honey sesame chicken, which was really really good and she kept stealing it. My other son loves miso soup and said theirs was top notch. I had the Thai Coconut Curry with steak and fried rice, something I've been craving since Pei Wei stopped carrying it. 

Their tables are limited and their dining space is pretty small. It wasn't too busy though. The space is clean and nicely decorated.

We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So good. No photos because I actually put my phone down to eat,  that's how much I liked it. We ordered the regular size portions of Mandarin orange chicken and the Hawaiian Carmel chicken (lightly breaded). REALLY good...  We'll be back.  Almost forgot.. My husband likes the double spicy and triple spicy options."}
{"text":"Reminds me of another smaller Chinese restaurant I love in West Mesa. Close to my work. Delicious chicken lettuce wraps. Fast service. excellent customer service! Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Ordered online 7:26pm on a Wednesday. Called 8:33pm \"I wanted to see if my online order came through?\" \"Yes, so sorry we were busy. Just called driver 8 minutes from you\". Cool I thought, better for me they were busy and an hour and 10 minutes for delivery is not unheard of. 9pm comes, the time they are supposed to close and 20 minutes past when the quoted time was, I call again. No answer... 9:20pm comes I drive there.


Long story short bad beginning.
They discounted and I got my food 2 hours later.

The food was decent but not worth it all and I would come off as bias if I wrote it out. Just beware I am not the first to mention delivery issues."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Ginger Zing last night for the first time. Unfortunately we ordered through Uber Eats which ended up being a total bust but the person helping us when we called the restaurant was helpful and efficient. Even offered to remake our food since it had been ready for a while and no one had picked it up yet. When we went in to get our food, we were told they do delivery (not just through Uber Eats or Postmates). The food was delicious! The miso soup perfect for a rainy night."}
{"text":"Hands down the best I've had in the east valley. 

First off, this place is immaculate. 

Secondly, the service was genuinely friendly.   Our server was helpful and laughed a bit with us, without being overbearing.   We liked him immediately.   The owner even came out and asked how we liked our food and we got the impression he was trying to build something with this place.   He even gave us some of those tasty little sugar biscuits to try on the way home.   Way cool, and they were in fact, delicious.  

Thirdly, the food was excellent.  From the Hot and Sour Soup, and spring rolls, to the entrees.    I got the Orange Chicken with the level 3 heat and my wife got the Honey Sesame.  Mine was really good, hers was awesome.   

I think this has become my new go-to place.   The owners here are clearly trying to do things right, and the staff and service just made this a good place to want to come back to.   I'm in."}
{"text":"Well yet again I did not have a chance to visit the establishment however was able to order online. Uber eats takes the order. I spoke with mike the manager, super friendly by the way and made sure the order was complete. The food again was yet amazing, not sure they serve anything that is not tasty. I promise next time I will clear my schedule and make it there to the restaurant. I certainly recommend this place to anyone who sees this review. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is so super good. Mandarin chicken and chicken fried rice exceeded my expectations. Generally not a huge fan of Chinese delivery but will make an exception for this! Fast delivery as well."}
{"text":"We stoped in here the other night craving Chinese Gingerzing was great there was an error with the order but we called brought it back in and they apologized and corrected it they are so friendly and so appreciative and the plates are generous portions it's definitely worth the $$!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, and delivery people are super friendly! This is our favorite delivery restaurants after a long day when no one has the energy to make dinner."}
{"text":"Panda Express, move aside... there's a new Chinese place in town. They're kicking ass and taking numbers. 

Definitely try to come before dinner. While they don't have too many tables, they do tend to fill up!

As you enter the place, the menu is off to your right and you order at the counter with a somewhat open kitchen so you can actually see who's making your food. 

Customer service was great from the get go. They greeted me upon entering and was patient with me while I looked at the menu, offering suggestions whenever I had a question. 

Decided to try the orange chicken since that's my usual Panda order and this place BLOWS them away."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out based on the other reviews, but I was disappointed in the flavor quality of some of the dishes.  The meals were prepared quickly and were steaming hot upon arrival.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant, but there are other local options with better overall taste quality."}
{"text":"Love the food here, always fresh and well prepared.  Super fast service too, it really does not get any better than this for the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Ginger Zing is the perfect name! It really has a zing! The names of their food are super fun and they are so yummy! I wish their lo Mein was better and their fried rice is just meh but overall it's a great place. We have ordered take out from here a couple times and always like seeing the yelp offers. They even gave us an extra free item last time!"}
{"text":"this place is family ownd and everyone is super nice. The food is authentic and ingredients are fresh. They have a variety of dishes but their menu isnt too overwelming. Prices are reasonable and you can't go wrong with their lunch! Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, and ginger zing has the best Chinese food I have ever tasted. The orange beef is amazing and my favorite dish. My wife gets the Thai curry beef and loves it. The rice is so fluffy and tasty. The crab puffs make my mouth water I want some right now just writing this review. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Definitely going to be a new regular at ginger zing."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. I had the orange chicken and the crab puffs. They were so crunchy and yummy. 

Went here for take out during lunch time. Food was ready so quick. Prices are reasonable. Service was great. They went out of their way to make sure I got everything I needed. 

This place is definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"This place must have new owners. We used to go here every Sunday for dinner but haven't in about a month. We were excited to get it tonight except it's terrible. Everything is 100% different than before. I do not understand how you can keep the same menu and completely change the ingredients and tasted. Even the fried rice is terrible. AWFUL. Please don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Great Orange chicken and cream cheese puffs. Really good lettuce wraps. The fried dumplings weren't the best I've had but were good. Delivery was fast and food was still too warm to eat when it arrived :)"}
{"text":"I have never been here but my mother had and convinced me to try it as well. The place is small and cute, only like 3-4 tables because it mainly is a takeout place. The menu was on  the left wall and we ordered the Mandarin Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Thai Peanut Chicken. We asked for sauce on the side for the orange chicken. We asked again after they had brought out our to-go order and made sure the sauce was on the side.  I'm stressing this because my mom said by the time you get home, the chicken gets soggy and it's not good. So she recommends everyone to get sauce on the side and pop the lid of the chicken when in the car (so it can't get soggy).

Hungry as I was, I dove in head first on the way out of our parking spot for the crab puffs (ask about the free crabpuffs if your order is over $20, I don't know how exactly often you can use it, but this was the second time my mom got this free special). We saw that our chicken did NOT have sauce on the side. My mother went back in and told them about it and the boss was super gentle and sweet. He instantly ran back to the kitchen to remake another Mandarin Orange Chicken for us. He also insisted we keep the Mandarin Orange Chicken we already had. He was honestly so nice.

We got the food home and it was great. The portions I think are kind of on the smaller side. It could feed one person, maybe two if you both don't eat too much. However, the food I think was great and I am not complaining. I already know I am going to come here again."}
{"text":"I order for the 1st time the mandarin orange chicken, which was awesome. I also got the cheese puffs which were over stuffed, they tasted great but I didn't like the sauce that came with them. They delivered the food right on time like they said and food portions are ok for price."}
{"text":"Horrible good, very generic, and bland. The deco is nice, but that's all. Haven't been there in a year but a horrible experience is long time remembered. I used to eat here before it was Ginger Zing, and it was my favorite . The new owners really ruined the place. When I reviewed the company on Facebook, I was attacked my management, accusing me of lying! What a horrible place!"}
{"text":"Had the sesame honey beef, sweet and sour chicken, chicken egg rolls and shrimp fried rice. Everything was really good. It's definitely a notch above the basic Chinese food offerings in the east valley. Lots of flavor and great quality!"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese food and delivery go, really good. We were starving, landed on Christmas day from a long vacation and therefore had no food in the house...ugh. Boyfriend was going to make spinach pie, all supermarkets were closed so no ingredients=no spinach pie :( Then we remembered a little something...A Christmas Story (greatest movie!) and Chinese food. 

MMM...Chinese food...Ginger Zing was open according to Yelp! So we called, they were friendly and they delivered. They were pretty busy but we still got our order in a decent time, it was hot, fresh and really freaking good. We got lettuce wraps that were good, pretty greasy but overall good. We also got sesame chicken that was so crispy, fresh, large chunks of meat, not a ton of breading and the flavor was great! Last but not least, eggrolls, they were definitely handmade and the sauce was good. One thing I could say though on a negative note was the sauce for the lettuce wraps was literally straight hoisin sauce, could have been such a better sauce. Fresh food, fresh ingredients, fast friendly service...Good to go!! :) Might be our new spot!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered take out from Ginger Zing several times and have had a great experience every time! I love the Hawaiian Carmel Chicken with white rice and my husband loves the Bangkok Fried rice, and we also love the Kung Pow Chicken. All yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the delivery never takes too long. But for some reason the stop answering the phone of you even if it isn't closing time which is definitely NOT COOL!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and came across this place, food was great, service was quick and very normal, prices weren't too pricey and if your looking to get full they are definitely not stingy with the meat portions. I'd definitely say check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is totally worth it. Their delivery is quick and their food in very well seasoned and cooked."}
{"text":"Good was fresh and had great flavor. Better version of Panda Express. The Hawaiian Carmel chicken was amazing. The orange chicken was also very good, a different kind of chicken in smaller pieces which I didn't prefer but my BF loved it. We also got the sesame honey chicken which was ok but needed more sauce. Great white rice and the cream puffs were filled with plenty of cream cheese! They also have an interesting sweet and sour sauce which has some spice to it, it was good. We got 3 meals for $21 each came with rice, brown or white (fried for an upcharge.) We will get it again."}
{"text":"Love the beef lo mein!! But everything else there was equally delicious. And there freshly made carb puffs were awesome."}
{"text":"After living in gilbert, phoenix and Mesa for 3 years I've finally found the best damn Chinese food!!! So tasty! I love that it's never dry! The siracha chicken is bomb and so is the Hawaiian Carmel chicken."}
{"text":"Love ginger zing! Hawaiian caramel chicken, siracha chicken & chicken lo mein. Crab puffs are best I've ever had. I live outside of delivery route but still took my order and delivered. Free dessert was given and they were so good."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Have been looking for a great Chinese place nearby and have not been impressed. Ordered a few times from ginger zing and have never got anything that wasn't great."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I can live without this place I had high expectations with them having four stars& all I had the Ginger broccoli beef also orange chicken not impressed the sauce that was applied on both dishes was OK in flavor but was to trenched in the meat&vegs.making the food mushy customer service was descent that was about the only thing I enjoyed"}
{"text":"This place is delicous.  I love that you can make any meal double or triple spicy.  I really enjoy Orange chicken, crab ragoons, pot stickers,  and bangcock rice.  It's really tasty."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a new place called Ginger Zing. Oh my goodness great chinese food for a fair price, and the taste is amazing. I have been back at least 5 times now trying different menu items. Chicken and beef dishes.cheese puffs and spring rolls, everything taste great. Homemade food now  I'm working on soups and dishes i have never had before. Great place to eat you all have to try Ginger Zing."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Chinese food! Awesome service and very fresh! You can call in for delivery or use a few of the food delivery apps. Better than PF or Pei Wei and good prices too."}
{"text":"This is a middle of the road, far from authentic, but still an okay-ish Chinese place.  While edible, it lacks any fantastical flare or sumptuous taste that would lead me to give this more stars.  We had tofu, chicken and beef dishes that left us really wanting more. \"Well, \" my husband said, \"It was better than a sharp stick in the eye.\" Yup. Kinda meh....."}
{"text":"Not good, total rip off for their delivery price. Poor service. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place and was hoping for the best. The food did come piping hot and ordered to my specifications. Unfortunately, the dishes that I ordered (chow mein and peanut chicken) lacked flavor. The chicken even tasted gaimy.

I do not think I will be ordered from this place again since there are many other Chinese places around my area."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Ginger Zing three times now and they have been fantastic every time! I love their cheese puffs so much I cannot seem to get enough! I am looking forward to another order I just placed. AMAZING FOOD!"}
{"text":"These people keep leaving their fliers on my door! my community has rules against solicitation and I even have a sign posted, I keep receiving these, even with the sign posted. I called the company to request to speak to a manager and ultimately was faced with a rude Asian man. I kept asking for a manager, initially, I was going to tell the manager to stop with the solicitation and leave it at that. I asked again for a manager and he got really nasty and hung up on me. I called back asking for a manager or the managers contact information and his (employee) name and was told the manager was not there (sure...) and he would not give up his name. I asked for an email for the manager and this guy still refused. I told him that I was calling the police to report this as it is possibly trespassing and am contacting an attorney... He said \"you threaten me, I call police now\". What in the world? I forgot to mention, my security camera caught the guy soliciting.

I am filling a complaint against the company with the city and will think about filing a lawsuit if they keep soliciting me. It is important to note, the city of Mesa requires a license for these solicitors and prohibits them from soliciting if signs are posted. I am sure a license will not matter, as this could be trespassing."}
{"text":"Yum! Cheese puffs were very good and over stuffed with cream cheese filling. The sweet chili sauce they are served with was tasty too. The ginger Mongolian beef was good, but a little too gingery for me. The sesame beef was the bomb and will keep me coming back for more. Fried rice was perfectly seasoned......usually find myself adding soy. No need here."}
{"text":"Love this take out~ they are very nice and the food is good and still hot when you get it home.
I ordered the ginger peppered beef with extra ginger....it needed a bit more. It's our second time there and we will be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"Quality, delicious and flavorful Chinese food, and I'm picky. It's not sugary. It's flavorful, which makes it so much better. 
My kids (ages 4 & 5) gobbled up the mandarin orange chicken and asked for seconds. 
The friend rice and Lo Mein are delicious! 
If you're over Panda Express and food coated in HFCS, this is your place. It's fantastic and we are ordering again for the second night in a row. 
So happy we tried it out."}
{"text":"We love this place for a quick to-go on a busy weekend night. Food is always good, consistent, and crave-able. Get the cream cheese puffs. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place was a solid 4 stars.  Food was good and as-expected.  I tried he sesame chicken and cheese wontons which were all good.  My wife who promised she wouldn't steal my takeout ended up sneaking my food and also really enjoyed it.  The service was helpful, fast and friendly.  I will definitely go back to try another menu item.  This place is a nice new addition to the area and I hope it does well!"}
{"text":"I wish they never changed owners. I used to love this place but recently I've ordered lettuce wraps and it just don't taste as good anymore its actually nasty I couldn't even stomach eating it all and also the cheese puffs they now have crab in them and I'm not a fan of crab the cheese puffs were better before new owners sad to say but I will not be returning the food is nasty now they should have atleast kept the same recipe and ingredients"}
{"text":"Went to Ginger Zing last night with my wife and nephew.  The food is the typical Cantonese style food.  It was overall good.   I had the moo goo gai pan (Chicken stir fry with vegetables).  My wife ordered four seasons.  My nephew somehow has a fondness for fried food, and ordered orange chicken.  Overall the food is good.  I may return in the future, as it appears to be a good restaurant, close to where I live, for Chinese carryout.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good Chinese carryout restaurant in Mesa AZ"}
{"text":"Having just moved here, I needed to find my go to Chinese joint and this spot definitely checks everything off my list. 

1) local and family owned
2) A+ customer service
3) BOMB FOOD
4) Fast delivery

Have been my go to for months now and this place ALWAYS hits the spot. 

Order the Hawaiian Carmel chicken and the cream cheese puffs. Will not regret. Orange chicken used to be my go to but order this!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Filled up on crab puffs, honey chicken, general tsao chicken - everything tasted wonderful and authentic. We will be coming back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had! Way better then pandas express and the food is cooked when your order and it comes out fast. They also do delivery too. Little more expensive then pandas, but the quantity and quality is twice better at least. Great food!"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery a few times from here and consistently the food has been amazing. 

Pad Thai, rice noodles, Hawaiian chicken and cheese puffs have all been delicious. I will soon branch out and try some new items. 

I ordered tonight and decided to pick up because I did a check in for a free order of cheese puffs and clicked on it (timer starts) because I was sure I would be able to use it when I got there. Unfortunately the lady working this evening said she couldn't honor it and a manager wasn't available to say otherwise. She told me she'd make an note for them and I could use it another time when I explained there's a timer and wouldn't be able to. She apologized and I understand things happen so I'm not mad. Not sure if it's a yelp or restaurant error but I hope the owner sees this post and maybe communicates with their employees or yelp so there's not any upset guest. 

I am def a ginger zing regular from now on, their food really is amazing."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, good portion sizes (one makes two meals for me) and as a huge bonus a really good vegetarian selection.  We are very happy to have an exciting and tasty alternative to pizza that we can both get really tasty food from.  Delivery is prompt and always polite.  Great value and great taste - what more can I say!"}
{"text":"The food here is just alright. I've ordered delivery a handful of times and it's always fast but the food leaves me unsatisfied. Except those dessert rolls. Those are delicious. Especially with coffee."}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out and delivery because it's right down the road. It's always on time and still hot! Very reasonably priced for good portions."}
