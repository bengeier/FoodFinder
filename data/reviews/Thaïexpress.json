{"text":"I ordered delivery from Just Eats at 6:45pm. We were promised the food would arrive by 7:25pm. It arrived after 8:00pm. We live about an 8 minute drive away. I ordered a soup with beef in it. Not a single piece of beef in the soup, and you know it costs more than vegetarian, right? It was luke warm and was also supposed to have tomatoes. No tomatoes. My husband called to let them know and said that something like this would prompt us not to order from them again. (We've picked up many times, in fact.) We got an apology but no offer of a coupon or special. Lame. That was my last order from that location."}
{"text":"it took them an hour and a half to deliver. After an hour of waiting I called to ask what happened and they said the guy was on his way. He came by 30 minutes later. The food wasn't that great either. Too much soya sauce. I've had better experiences from other Thai Expresses"}
{"text":"Gross. Over an hour for delivery and what they sent as Tom Yum soup was disgusting and inedible. Absolutely disgusting. Never again."}
