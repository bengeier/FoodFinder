{"text":"Go to Maple Yip to eat and get out. This tiny restaurnt is nothing to look at and has zero ambiance. However, the place seems relatively clean, the food good, the price excellent, service swift (not rude). But don't dawdle! Make your selections quickly, the food will come in 5 minutes, and you should expect to be out the door no matter what you order within 45mins-1 hour. Dishes are medium sized portions, but because of the low price, you can afford to select a few more dishes. Steamed, braised, stir fried, all good. Deep fried stuff so-so - seafood birds nest basket did not appear fresh - a little bit chewy, not so crisp and a little old oil taste. The seafood in it was great - scallops with mix of broccoli, snow peas etc. Sweet and sour pork a bit fatty, but ok. They do a good roast BBQ chicken. Bitter melon with beef also good. Good green beans, good single oysters wtih black bean sauce, lobster with vermicelli dish that comes with set dinner for 4 was a bit teensy and missing a claw, so not recommended as an option. A good place to go with family and casual dining. Make reservations or plan to eat an early dinner, like 5:30pm if you want to try walking in. This place is popular (at least right now)."}
{"text":"The food here is decent at best compared to other Cantonese restaurants around the Scarborough area, prices are reasonable. However the services and attitudes of waiters and even the owner is repulsive.  They will try to sell you seasonal items and if you don't order them they would give you an attitude. Arriving early for a reservation and they made us wait 20 minutes, when we ask they blamed aloud around other customers who are eating \"its because these customers have been eating for a long time and wont leave\"   Special dishes we ordered ahead of time was not prepared, they didn't bother calling us to inform it couldn't be prepared either.    They close at 11pm and once we arrived at 10:15 they hurried us to order because \"all their chefs are taking off\"  These are some of many incidents to show they simply dont care for your business and why we finally decide to never go back again.  Why put yourself thru this humiliation?  Their food isnt good enough to lose your respect over."}
{"text":"If you are looking ambience, this is not the place for that.  However if you are looking for quality Chinese food, this is the place to go to.  Best items on the menu is chicken stuffed with sticky rice. The chicken is so crispy.  The winter mellon soup is excellent. You have to pre-order both the soup and the chicken if you want to try. They normally ask you if you want to pre-order when you call in for reservation.  The crab is also very yummy!!  Pork belly is delicious!  Minced pork with string beans, thumbs up."}
{"text":"I made a reservation in advance for a family dinner for 6 people.  The tables are very tight, we was crammed into an uncomfortable corner.  We pre-ordered some of the food already, but halfway through the dinner we wanted to add a few more dishes.  The waitress does not allow us to order more food,  because she said there's seating limit of 2 hrs.    But we was never told there is a time limit when we made our reservation.  They just quickly serve all the other dishes and give us the final bill.  And tell us the next table is coming soon, please leave ASAP.       I doubt I'll ever return to Maple Yip as there are plenty of good Chinese restaurants in Scarborough that offer excellent food and customer service."}
{"text":"Their food is excellent and I can't complain about it.  Though EVERY time my family and I have dinner there it seems as if they want us out as soon as possible.  We have no idea why as we're not a troublesome group or anything.  And it still happens even when there are several empty tables around.  So why can't they just leave us alone to enjoy a nice, quiet dinner?  I'd leave them four stars but because the service lacks two is the way to go.  By the way, I absolutely LOVE their Maggi shrimp dish!"}
{"text":"My first time here at this restaurant. Food was good. The restaurant was busy and seeing  that tells me it's popular and have good food BUT the some  of the servers (ladies) were RUDE!  When this  lady was clearing our table, I decided  to help her put an empty can in the bowl which she was doing the same. Boy, she started saying things in their dialect & gave me a look.  I told her I'm not Chinese and just ignored me.  This place is not suitable to take kids as well. They might get their \"head bitten off\".  Not impressed  with the restaurant's  service & attitude."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! The last time I went we had to take a 5:30pm reservation just because they were fully booked -- do make a reservation as you won't likely get a walk-in table, or may just need to wait forever.  This place feels like a chinese diner, you can tell a lot of the folks here are locals/regulars. They serve all your traditional Cantonese dishes, but also what you would have at home. Very authentic and the quality is always consistent. I've been here several times and each time we try a different dish, it always a good surprise, delightful, and very tasty!"}
{"text":"It's in a dumpy mall with tight parking spaces. The tables are crammed in together. It's loud, and you'll occasionally want to do something violent to the crowd blocking the doorway.   But my family has been coming here for years, it's our standby for all occasions. Even with all the negatives deducted, it's still 5-star. In fact, I just came back from there an hour ago. And that's because the food is not only consistently amazing, but they have a lot of dishes you and many other restaurants don't want to spend the time preparing, like mui choi kau yuk (preserved vegetable on fatty pork). It's also relatively less greasy and more clean than most other Chinese restaurants. They have seasonal seafood too, which though not cheap, is always good.  Coming here for dinner without a reservation is like using your finger to test how hot water is in a pot on a stove. While calling, consider asking about the pre-order stuff that they have, like the glutinous-rice stuffed whole boneless chicken, or the wintermelon soup (served inside the melon!) (warning: both of these are large dishes, so it's more for parties)."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this restaurant for years but this is my first review.  The place is always busy and it is best to make reservations before hand or be prepared to wait.   There are many good items in the menu but the following are my favs...  1.  Sticky rice chicken.  Basically a chicken is deboned and then stuffed with sticky rice and cooked until the skin is super crispy.  Simply delish!  Chicken is tender, sticky rice is flavourful.  Must be ordered in advance. 2.  Winter-melon soup.  Soup with small pieces of meat, mushroom, seafood served in a large winter melon.  The melon is thoroughly cooked thru and you scrape the inside of the melon to get the meat of the melon.  Very good as well.  Also must be ordered in advance.  Other good dishes are the deep fried taro nest with seafood and vegetables, saut√©ed green beans with pork (very tasty, beans are crunchy but cooked), and this egg dish that has the same consistency of creme caramel but is salty and topped with small shrimp, mushrooms and other small veggies.  Service is very good and fast.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Please, save u guys the gas and time to go to this restaurant! We ordered 100$ of takeout , and the PORTION WAS SO LITTLE!!!!! Like the amount of food we get, we would have paid around 50$! We ordered two lobsters, and I think we only got one!!!! What the f***. I gave one star only because the Food taste ok ish. Will never go again!"}
{"text":"They tried to sneak in a $45 \"sticky rice stuffed chicken\" onto the bill that we did not order. Nonchalantly said it was a \"mistake\" and \"fixed\" it. Then added forced 12% service charge AFTER taxes. It is not written anywhere in the restaurant or menu. Was told I have to pay it because their staff are underpaid. Left a sour taste in my mouth. Dishonest, will not return. We also had made a reservation for 8 and was given the smallest table where the things we ordered basically didn't fit."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant because of the food (generally, not too salty or heavy) and service. We ordered: - the fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice (ordered in advance), $38 - so good.  the skin was thin and crispy, the rice was flavorful. - the pork belly with preserved vegetable - it looks like it's supposed to be a very salty or soy sauce heavy dish but it wasn't at all.  very light. - braised fish - fried fish tail on top of bok choy with some pieces of meat and broiled/fried pork fat.  the fish was fat and fresh.  overall, a nice new thing to try over the usual steamed fish. - steamed stuffed bean curd (under the chef's recommendation page of the menu) - we had expected individual rectangles of tofu stuffed with shrimp.  instead, we got a platter that had a layer of egg tofu topped with shrimp, mushrooms and vegetables.  a pleasant surprise.  nice and light too. - sauteed pea shoots with 2 types of garlic (roasted/fried and sauteed) - husband liked that they kicked it up a notch by adding roasted/fried garlic as well.  the last 4 dishes were served first as we had arrived early and the stuffed chicken was not yet ready.  i ate those dishes without white rice and everything was very light in the mouth and stomach.  nothing too salty that i needed white rice to neutralize it and nothing too oily or heavy that i felt too full.  after the stuffed chicken came, my friends and i were already planning a return trip for next week as we wanted to try more of the dishes.  and as for service, what i appreciated the most was the friendliness of Daphne who took my reservation and advance order.  she was very accommodating."}
{"text":"I have to say this place's food is amazing, I came here a few times and the food quality has been consistently good. So Reason for the one star? Today, four of us had a great time until check out; in our past experience the restaurant includes a ~15% tip in the bill, so we paid the exact amount in cash and didn't leave any additional tips. As we were walking out, the waiter stopped us and yelled \"excuse me you can't leave, you didn't pay enough tip\"... ????  I told him that the bill should've include the tip amount and he said no, I started pulling cash, apologized, and was explaining to him that the bill we used to get had tips built in, and therefore we didn't pay more and he said \"no that didn't happen\", this is when I started getting frustrated as he was clearly lying to my face, in addition to requesting something that's never mandatory in the first place. To be honest I would've felt super bad if he simply told me that he thinks I missed giving tips, and would've paid a lot more to compensate, but the moment he started requesting tips as if it was mandatory for a meal, his tip started going straight down like a crashing plane."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant threex times.  It seems to me each time was worse than the last visit.  Portions were smaller  and the price was sometimes raised.  The seafood dishes the last two times were not as fresh as should be.  The vegetable dishes definitely not worth the price they charged.  Service got worse even though they seemed to have enough servers.  The server brought the dishes to your table and just dumped them anywhere that was convenient to them.  It certainly was a disppointment for all of us becasie the first time wasn't bad, the second time was so so but we thought it was just a bad night, but the third time was worse.  This restaurant definitely did not live up to some of the reviews I read below  Everyone who went with us that evening voted that we would never go there again."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is quick.  The price range varies on what you order; I like the Szehuan pan fried shrimp and the bitter melon stir fry with beef.  Looking forward on a return."}
{"text":"This a unique little Chinese restaurant tucked away in a small plaza which you will never see on the main street.  I came here by accident with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed our seafood meal.  There was a lot of traditional dishes eaten with rice family style.  I went back months later to try the roasted chicken stuffed with sticky rice.  It costed 43$ for the chicken.  Their labours and care to make this delightful roast that took a 4.5 hr process was worth every penny.  The other dishes included cast iron pot eggplant, winter melon soup and cast iron onion ginger oysters were awesome.  Our total bill came to 130$ for a family of 4.  It was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Chinese food.  I mean a lot. I have eaten it all across Canada; eaten it all across China, and if there is one place I can guarantee a good Chinese dinner this is it.  There are so many good things about this restaurant it is hard to know where to start.    The day before you are going to eat there I would recommend you call ahead and order the winter melon.  I believe last time it cost around $40 for a medium/large melon.   This melon is steamed and inside is a soup with seafood and vegetables.  The best part if you can eat the bowl afterwards!  It is the perfect starter for any meal, but you have to order it the day before because it is so hard to make.  If you have company or are entertaining they are guaranteed to be blown away.    I also recommend the stuffed chicken.  It also needs to be ordered the day before and I have no idea what the chinese name is, but it's a culinary wonder.  They basically debone a chicken from the inside, stuff it with rice and things and then stitch it back together.  The service at Maple Yip is great.  In fact your longest wait is waiting to get a table!  In typical Chinese fashion all the dishes hit the table within moments of each other.  My personal favorites are the mixed seafood in a taro bird's nest, deep fried pork chops, stir-fried vegetables and Garlic, salt and pepper squid and the best mei-cai kou rou in the city.  The name translates terribly to preserved vegetables with pork belly.  But think bacon, cut thick & slowly braised in soy sauce, served on a bed of cabbage that soaks up the juices and fat.  All I can say is \"Hell Ya!\""}
{"text":"My cousin and I went on a Sunday after noon around 3 pm to sample the Peking duck, The restaurant was almost empty and soon enough we were the only customers there. The waitress seated us with some menus and then for the next 20 minutes completely ignored us as we waited to place our orders. We were debating whether to leave or not but we really wanted to try the Peking duck. So eventually after 20 mins they snapped into action and took our orders. The food came promptly and was okay. The duck was moist and soft and skin was crispy and the second course was good too. The portions were big.   Again they displayed their horrible service when we were ready to pay our bill we had excess food left over so we wanted to take it to go. They didn't even bother packing it for us, they just gave us a container and we had to put it all in ourselves.  Regardless of whether the food was good or not, I would never go here again."}
{"text":"I would give ZERO star for I have choice! I have never been in any restaurant where the manager and waiters will ask you to leave because you stayed for too long, refuse give you menu to order more food. plus, they have no shame to add 11% of tax on the bill after they asked to leave."}
{"text":"This was my second time going there.  First time was very good.  This time we ordered Peking duck served in 2-ways.  We were given a very small portion of scallion to eat with the duck, so we asked for more but yet we had to pay extra which I thought was unnecessary and sort of a rip off.  Saut√© string beans were good.  Braised Oyster was decent but over cooked slightly."}
{"text":"I have been here twice based on Yelp recommendations. The first time was lunch. I thought the dishes were pretty good but my dad thought they were all under seasoned. I would rather have dishes light and under seasoned rather than overly salty. To each their own. At any rate, I don't see what the fuss is about with respect to traditional Hong Kong/Cantonese cuisine. I grew up with the stuff and I didn't find anything special about it. I will say that everything had a light and clean taste to it that in my opinion was not under seasoned.   The second time we went for dinner and it was a busy Sunday night. Firstly, none of the lunch set menu specials were available. The dinner was not very cheap anymore as without rice a set dinner for 6 was ploughs through rather fast. I have to admit though, we are not carb eaters and if we each had a bowl of rice or two, it would have been plenty. Either way, the bill came out to well over $120 after taxes between the 4 of us and a 3 year old.   I don't think we are a lot per se. We are all on low carb diets with smaller stomachs than we had before. I just don't see the value here as everybody says they are reasonable in price? I would only agree with that for their lunch special menu.   Average food for average to above average price (depending on the time of day)."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Maple Yip Seafood Cuisine: Chinese Location: Scarborough Address: 4227 Sheppard Ave East Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 3  Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * BYOB * Delivery * Open for lunch * Parking avail at front  I have probably mentioned that my family eats more Chinese food then some Chinese families, yes? It's only after we moved to Toronto that I go to Korean restaurants so often cause they are actually good. When we lived in Vancouver, we never ever even thought to go eat at Korean restaurants. So the weekend comes and we are trying to decide on where to eat? Chinese food!  After couple recommendations from people, I decided to check out Maple Yip. I was warned that this restaurant is not very non-chinese friendly but we went with a friend who can speak the language to help us out, Yay!  Ordered: Braised Pork belly with preserved vegetables  * Fatty pork pieces cooked with chopped up vegetables * The entire dish is marinated so I like to eat this with rice * Porkbelly is so tender and soft it melts in your mouth * This is my dad's favorite dish and is sold in Korea as well but very pricy!!  Ordered: Lobster  * We ordered small lobster since we wanted to try other dishes * This was decent but nothing special * To be honest the lobster was so small there wasn't much to eat  Ordered: Snow Pea Leaf (Dai Miu)  * This is my favorite type of Chinese vegetable * Usually stir fried with bit of garlic, it's suttle in terms of flavor  * You can sometimes order this at Dim Sum places as well  Ordered: Roasted Quail/Pigeon  * I first tried this at my friend's birthday dinner * The meat is dark and quite gamey  Ordered: MaPo Tofu  * Pretty standard dish at Chinese restaurants * It wasn't made very spicy and had overall mild flavor  Ordered: Spicy deep fried porkchops  * Porkchop pieces are cut up and then deep fried, sprinkled with chili and salt * This is overall very dry but it came hot and crispy * Chili flakes kick in a little after  Summary: Maple Yip is a solid chinese restaurant that serves good, quality food. It is a little far from where I live so it does take a bit of travel time but heck, if you want good asian food- you gotta travel uptown."}
{"text":"Fantastic wok hay at this traditional Cantonese restaurant.  Very fresh ingredients, seasonal seafood, decent Peking duck.  The special pre-order glutinous rice stuffed whole chicken is amazing and crispy.  Fantastic taro bird's nest w/ stir fried shrimp.  Sweet n sour pork done right.  Steamed fish done to perfection.  Stir fry veggies are spot on.  On and on it goes, consistently busy and well priced."}
{"text":"Lok Yu is one of my family's favourite Chinese family restaurants to go to for all occasions. They have a wide variety of menu items and service is fairly friendly.   Standouts include the \"Oil-Drizzled Chicken\" which is moist chicken with crispy skin doused with a mixture of soy sauce and oil with scallions and Chilis scattered on top of it. Their scallop with garlic and vermicelli noodles is awesome, as is their Clay Pot Rice (I particularly like it with the Chinese sausages and preserved meats, the lap Cheung is wonderful). For the Clay Pot Rice it takes at least half an hour to make so order it right when you get in if you want it.   Be warned they are super busy on the weekends and can run out of their items... That's the major reason why I can't give them 5/5. Make sure you reserve in advance for bigger parties and see if you can reserve menu items as well!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night and this place is still busy. Even though it's not fully booked but most tables are filled. I reserved a winter melon soup and the chicken wrapped sticky rice. To be honest I don't think the winter melon soup worths (I think it's $34). It's good but it's not extraordinary good. However, the chicken wrapped sticky rice is very good. It costs around $48 if I remember correctly but it's very good indeed. The skin is crispy and there are still some meat from chicken that also wrapping the sticky rice, so it won't make the dish tastes too oily and heavy. Will definitely come for this dish in future. I have also ordered 3 more dishes which they are in reasonable price range and they tastes so good as well. I like their sweet sour pork because they don't fake the size my using too much flour. Also they fried it dry enough that there is only enough sauce for the meat, so it is not too \"saucy\" comparing to other restaurants. Overall I like this place, and their service is not bad as well. Food comes pretty fast too."}
{"text":"- solid old school cantonese joint in scar-lem. - no frills place that is always busy. - decent peking duck. very good pea shoots and crab meat (not all restaurants do this well)  bonus tip - they're doing a hollowed/carved out winter melon filled with seafood these days. didn't try it, but don't think it's worth the $35 for it."}
{"text":"I had read a lot about this restaurant on one of the food luver forum online and was looking forward to dining here. Some friends organised a get together of like minded folks and ordered some of the dishes that require an advance notice for preparation.   From the outside the place doesn't look like much and is located at the back of a nameless/faceless shopping area. As I walked in I saw a mini lineup of sorts (always a good sign) of people waiting to be seated. Once inside one is hit with the noise associated for these kind of restaurants. I spotted my group in a corner and and grabbed a seat. Since we had pre-ordered we didn't need to go over the menu and waited for the food to arrive. 1) Pork with lotus root and broth. I didn't try this dish but the fellow diners commented the sweet finish was nice on the root vegetables. The broth didn't look appetizing though as it was quite murky. 2) A vegetable medley with melon and broccoli.  A vegetarian dish that I enjoyed. There were 3 kind of mushrooms/fungi i.e shitake, Wood ear and bamboo pith (I think) The presentation was nice as the top was covered with a melon. The server carved the dish for us which is a nice touch. I had similar non vegetarian versions of this dish before (with scallops) and this one was done well.  3) Steamed oysters done two ways (black bean and garlic). Visually appealing but nothing to write to home about.These are full sized oysters so the meat is not delicate and the duo of sauces covers this inherent flaw for this dish.  4) Chicken with seafood stuffing. This item needs to be ordered in advance. A very interesting dish as the skin and bones were perfectly separated from the meat and then stuffed with shrimp paste and then put back on. The taste reminded me of one of my favorite items for dim sum (stuffed crab claws). There was red dipping sauce as well.  Highlight of the menu IMO. 5) Steamed grouper with soy, scallions and ginger. A standard dish which is used as yardstick to assess the steam cooking abilities of a chef. This dish was overcooked IMO.  6)  Crab with egg whites. The legs were coated lightly with batter and then fried. The main shell was stuffed with a scrabbled egg white and crab meat. Beautiful presentation again. Taste was very subtle and I think this dish could have come from any region. A good item to order if you like crab and don't enjoy it with any sauces. There was red wine vinegar on the side if you are inclined to use a sauce (I would advise against it as it takes away from the taste)  7) Duck filled with treasures. A stewed version of duck stuffed with lotus seeds. Most of the meat was thankfully de-boned. I did not enjoy this dish as apart from the texture it was devoid of taste.  8) Dessert was soup with sesame seed paste stuffed in rice. Meh. I didn't try the pork belly and rice dish, fellow diners really liked the pork belly. Service was inconsistent as the servers kept bringing us dishes that we didn't order. To be fair it was busy Saturday but if we were not vigilant I would hate to be one of the folks on the other tables who didn't get their dishes.  We got a good value for money on this meal as it was within budget. There was one dish that really stood out. 3 Stars all said and done."}
{"text":"Have been going there for the past few years when my wife and I visit Scarborough and Markham area.  Great and consistent foods there every time.  Very good services too!!  Make sure to call a head for reservation if you have 6 people or more."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Quick to the point of greatness.  BUT YOU MUST   Get a reservation."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese restaurant. My friend recommended this place and also provided me with a list of her fav dishes. The absolute best were the salty chicken and the taro birds nest dishes. The flavours are not overpowering or just plain salty- all the dishes have their own combination of seasoning that's just right. And staff is friendly too!! The only downside are the washrooms in the basement. Needs renovating."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience overall speaking, but not great. The food is nice but service could've been better in my opinion.. Location is good though easy to find on sheppard."}
{"text":"The decor and venue is much like any typical Chinese restaurant. The staff and service were very friendly and attentive, which is uncommon from my experience with Chinese restos. Everything was quickly prepared. The winter melon soup and crispy chicken stuffed with sticky rice are must orders as mentioned in previous reviews (pre-order). The beef and broccoli in a birds nest was yummy too, filled with soft and tender cuts of beef. Well done! Nothing else to really rave about. If you're looking for good Chinese food and happen to be in the area, I would definitely recommend! I wouldn't trek here though if I were more than a 15 minute drive"}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant all the time.. The food is there is very authentic and is very consistent.. You will not have a good dish there one time and the next time it totally tastes different.. Overall, this place is amazing.. Great food at a very reasonable price, but when going here, do not expect to get seated right away because it is always extremely packed..."}
{"text":"This place is our family's birthday go to place... It not elegant or fancy but their food is really really good!!!! All the dishes I had so far has all been really good! They have set lunches there that are really good and priced at like 6 bucks!"}
{"text":"was here for new years eve weekend with my wife and a friend.  This place is authentic chinese food. The place gets packed so best to make a reservation beforehand.  When here you must try the \"law mai gai\"  which is an entire chicken stuffed with glutinous rice literally.  This dish you must pre order the day before b/c it takes time to make.  The chicken was delicious.  It was surprisingly crunchy skin with juicy meat inside.  The Glutinous rice was okay.  My family makes a better one. But the overall presentation was awesome!  The winter melon soup  is another dish that was really good and also need to be preordered the day before.  The soup is cooked inside an actual winter melon.   We also had a tofu dish which was really great.  Definitely looking forward to coming back here again.       service was pretty good. They came to check on us.  They were very efficient with everything."}
{"text":"The boneless chicken stuffed with sticky rice is a must have. All other dishes were mediocre."}
{"text":"Been here so many times but never tried the boneless chicken stuffed with sticky rice.  Finally got to try it tonight with the family, and it did not disappoint! Everyone was impressed.   As other Yelpers have mentioned, the chicken meat is not dry at all- and the skin is so crispy!  As suggested by other Yelpers, we also order the seafood bird nest dish.  The fried taro was really good!   Definitely pre-order the stuffed chicken. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Maple Yip has been a staple in this Chinese strip plaza for many years. The restaurant is not too big, and has some interesting (questionable) renos (the raised addition room to the right when you walk in and the room in the basement). But the reason people keep coming back is for the excellent and authentic Chinese food.   They have all the standard Cantonese/HK dishes as well as some more specialty items like deboned fried chicken stuff with sticky rice. They are also good with their fish and seafood dishes.  As per most Chinese restaurants, the food comes out fast.   Make sure you have reservations or you may be disappointed. Also, if you want a specialty soup like winter melon, you will want to call ahead and reserve one. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  A very prolific member of that other foodie membership site recently organized an outing here. I'll call him \"CY\". Although he is quite active on the boards and he uses his full name as his handle I'm not sure he'd welcome any additional publicity.   CY is a boisterous, enthusiastic gourmand who is well traveled and knowledgeable in his gastronomic pursuits. Got a seafood story to share? Say, you enjoyed eating Maine lobster off the docks? Spent time ice fishing for perch on a local lake? Well, CY will gleefully bust out his tale of the time he enjoyed live caught king crab off oil drums on a moving vessel up in Alaska! He very much knows his food and listening to him wax on about the glories of such and such a dish is half the fun as it is enjoying it with him.   CY's specialty is Chinese food, in particular Cantonese cuisine. So when he organized a dinner at Maple Yip, a local and capable Cantonese eatery, I literally jumped at the chance. Dinner with CY and other enthusiasts? YES! Banquet style with dishes specifically picked by CY himself? Count me in!  The dinner was preset and contained many elaborate, off-the menu specialties. CY was a gracious and charming host. Our group certainly had our work cut out for us that evening while I was simply giddy to be inhaling the familiar scents of good Cantonese cooking.  We enjoyed: Fried Soft Shell Crab seasoned with a garlicky chili pepper salt. A little spicy, lightly fried. A nice start and a good harbinger of the banquet to follow.  Chinese fried egg tortilla with silver ray fish and preserved radishes. Moist but this dish didn't register much of an impression on me.   Braised Pork Belly with Chinese preserved Mustard Greens. CY boasted that this was much better than any pork belly from David Chang. I would have to agree what with the quivering slices of porky goodness we had on our plates. This was very rich and very savory. The mustard greens helped to keep things real.   Double boiled whole winter melon seafood soup. Very subtle, delicate flavors. Impressive visually because they use a whole winter melon as a container for the soup and they top the crown of it with seafood meat. This was a nice refreshing cleanse before the main entrees arrived. Good aromatics from the use of shrimp and ham in the broth.   Crispy chicken deboned and stuffed with a sticky rice mixture. This had a dramatic presentation because you wonder, how do they do sticky rice inside fried chicken? However, despite the added flair, I found the chicken to be a shade dry and flavorless. Ditto for the sticky rice, where was the seasoning?   Yellow fin grouper with Yellowing Chives on a bed of Chinese greens. Delicious and again, subtle flavoring from the yellowing chives. The soft flesh of the fish was not compromised in anyway from the cooking treatment.  Beef tenderloin cubes stir fried with cashew nuts, broccoli nestled in a deep fried Taro nest. Excellent dish from a texture standpoint as you can imagine. Perfectly cooked beef cubes, crunchy cashew, crispy taro's nest=party in my mouf. I was expecting a little more in the wok hay fireworks department from the beef though.  Sauteed lobsters in maagi sauce. I was borderline full at this point. But who can resist sweet lobster meat with garlicky, savory seasonings? Not me. A tad overcooked.  Dungeness crab in an egg white sauce on a bed of fried rice steamed in lotus leaves. Just so-so.  The crab meat was not very robust in its natural flavors. Hoping for more seasoning and aromatics from this one.   Dessert: A mung bean sweet congee soup with mochi balls filled with black sesame paste. Hell yes. The perfect happy ending.   $50 all in including tax and tip. More than reasonable considering the variety and skill level of the dishes we ate. Service was efficient. The servers assigned to our tables quickly and expertly divvied up the portions for each dish amongst our group. Caveat: I do think we may have gone on a slightly off night -an observation to which our host conceded. As mentioned above, I was expecting a little more wok hay or smokiness from some of the dishes and if I had to be real nit-picky about things I'd say some of the dishes were off the mark in the execution of seasoning (over/under). Still, it was miles above anything I've had in New York, the company was fantastic and it leaves me jonesing for more Cantonese banquet dinners in the future."}
{"text":"Okay long over due review.  I came here a couple of times with my friends while visiting Toronto.  Its Cantonese food. Mind you.... you must order the Chicken stuffed with Sticky rice (aka \"law mai gai\")... but you must pre order it a day in advance b/c it takes time for them to make the chicken.  They must debone it and then stuff it.  But the Chicken is delicious.  Its really fresh the skin is crispy and the meat is so juicy and flavorful and the sticky rice is good too. And, while you're here you should try the wintermelon soup - which is actually in a winter melon (also must pre-order the day before). Overall food here is delicious.  Definitely worth the trip.   Also, they give you the red bean soup as dessert after (i'm not a big fan of red bean soup so it was okay to me). Service is okay typical of any Chinese restaurant.    Also, make sure you call ahead to make reservation as that restaurant gets really packed for dinner time."}
{"text":"One to check off the list; it is worth a try. Definitely not a cheap eats but glad to have the experience under the belt. The service is typical of a fast pace canto restaurant, you'll get what you need and fast. Pricing is a bit steeper than most in comparison. Most first timers would definitely come for the chicken stuffed with sticky rice and the winter melon soup, these require to be preordered.   We ordered the sticky rice stuffed chicken, the winter melon soup, an onion ginger 4lbs lobster, a fried Cantonese chow mien, and a veggie stir-fry. This was definitely enough to feed a family of 6 full grown adults. Overall, there is nothing hugely problematic with the food, most are well prepared and typical. Actually, that's probably my biggest impression of the restaurant. I came in expecting to be wowed but left with a minimal impression.   To start off, the chicken stuffed with sticky rice. Expensive as it may be, I get why it's priced the way it is. The chicken is mostly deboned. The sticky rice the cooked to the right consistency and flavourful. The chicken itself wasn't dried and skin crispy. However, the meat is very underwhelmingly unseasoned. Once you get through all the rice and skin, the bland meat of the thighs, legs, and wings left much to be desired. A dusting of salt is much needed.   The wintermelon soup was not a cheap eat either. Though it's filled with pork meat (likely young ribs), dried scallop, and other seafood, I had a hard time justifying the price. It was a nice touch to serve the wintermelon in its own peel and whole, but it's pretty much for aesthetic. Nothing to complain about just the price.  The fried chow mien, stir fried vegetables, and lobster once again basic, you get less toppings on the chow mien than other places, but the flavor and texture were decent. Be advised, it will be an additional $10 for HK chili styled lobster.  Ended the meal with complimentary red bean sweet soup. Overall, it an experience worth trying. I definitely feel that there are better places and worse places - it didn't really left much of an impression."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I been here, and I must say I was rather disappointed. There was this one waitress who tried selling us the seasonally priced seafood when we wanted another themed dinner.   The meal didn't flatter me. It lacked \"life,\" and zest. However, the special black chicken soup was delicious. I was disappointed with the pork as it was rather fatty. Overall hit and miss, but more of a miss today."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this hidden gem. So much to try... this is my first visit of many. The pork belly with pickled veggies is a must. Also loved the beef taro nest and out absolute highligh... the wintermelon soup petfect for a cold day in spring/fall/winter. Can't wait to try more soon."}
{"text":"Good peking duck and the service is quick and friendly.  If you are going with a big group, make reservations.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood cooking.  Super friendly staff. Real Cantonese style   Also very good price"}
{"text":"While searching for sticky rice stuffed chicken, I came across raving reviews about this restaurant. A small restaurant tucked away at the corner of Sheppard and Midland, I did not expect it to have been this packed. Luckily we made reservations and seated promptly upon arrival (24 hours' notice is required for the stick rice chicken). For a family of 5 we ordered the following:   Chicken stuffed with sticky rice: the reason we came to this restaurant and it did not disappoint. The chicken was incredible crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and stuffed with delicious glutinous rice. It was about $45 for the whole chicken (which I was told is considered pricey), but it was enough to feed us 5 with leftovers so very worth it in my opinion. (Plus there's not many restaurants across the city that serves this!)   Peking duck: mediocre at best. The duck comes out carved (vs carved in front of you).   Steamed oysters: I saw another table order this at it smelled so good I had to check it out myself. The oyster comes with thin vermicelli and loads of garlic (yum!)  Seafood \"Bird's Nest\": loaded with quality seafood  I saw many tables order the wintermelon soup, which apparently also requires a 24 hour notice. I am not a huge fan of wintermelon but given its popularity, I'll have to try it the next time around.   Service was prompt, as expected of a Chinese restaurant. We were in an out in 1 hour."}
{"text":"Found in a sketchy plaza with no signs out front is this hidden gem. It's so tucked away, I doubt I would see or know about it just driving by. Even as I walked up to the main entrance, it seemed like a total hole-in-the-wall but I was surprised to find a packed restaurant in a moderate space with an old school setup.   They weren't serving the duck that night but we had called a day earlier to reserve two of their signature dishes which was the Winter Melon Soup and the Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice. Along with that, we ordered an Assorted Seafood Birdnest, Snow Pea Leaves with King Mushrooms and a Steamed Fish.  It was the perfect amount of food for 4 people and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. Their signature dishes definitely did not disappoint. The Winter Melon Soup ($30) will warm you right up on a cold day. Very savory with generous amounts of seafood, lotus, wintermelon, etc. given! The Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice is another item not to be missed. Although not cheap ($42), it was quite worth it. Chicken skin was crispy, meat wasn't dry and the sticky rice was moist but not super oily. This dish is exclusive to Maple Yip as I don't think I've come across any other Chinese restaurants offering this.   The seafood basket is a good choice because it gives the table a little more variety and the taro bird nest is delicious. They didn't go overboard with the sauce which allowed the nest to stay crispy 'til the very end. Points for unsogginess! As for the steamed fish ($35), everyone agreed that the flavors were all on point and perfectly cooked. Our server brought out the fish to show that it was freshly \"caught\" prior to bringing it into the kitchen. Again, not exactly cheap but the fish was a lot bigger and meatier than we had expected. Our vegetable dish (snow pea leaves with king mushrooms) was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.   I recommend coming here with someone who speaks Cantonese for easier communication and even better, someone who can read Chinese because most of their specials are written on the walls.   Service was great, everyone was pleasant and helpful.   Our bill came out to $160 before tip but if you take into consideration the items that we ordered (which were pretty much some of the most expensive ones), it's reasonable.   This place isn't fancy or pretentious - just straight up delicious and authentic food."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for its lunch specials on a Wednesday. This is a very old long time restaurant that is popular in scarborough.  It is the typical Cantonese style restaurant. Fast, efficient, and good for your wallet.   We ordered two of the lunch specials, on is the sweet and sour pork, and the other is the hot pot with winter melon pork and tofu. Both dishes came out fast. and the food is very good for the price. This is the old school cantonese restaurants were the expectations is not on the presentation value, or an new fusion dishes. its about classic old school chinese cuisine. Both Dishes were cooked the way you expect. of course the hot pot was good for the price, and though it was lacking a little in terms of marinating time clearly. it is still a decent dish for the price of 6.99 lunch special that includes rice.   I've been to this restaurant at night and it is typically packed. most of its customers are older Chinese seniors. which is always a good sign when you want a restaurant that is both priced well, and the cooking is classic.   I Believe this is the type of restaurant that i would go whenever i want old school authentic cuisine that is focused on taste and price and not the WOW factor.   Definitely a Fan, and i would suggest anyone can bring family and parents to a restaurant like this and not be disappointed in taste budd or wallet. Of course this is not a Date restaurant by any means, as the decor is much like its food styling, not focused on the looks."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have to say, that I wasn't physically in their restaurant.  However my family went, and brought me some take out.  I'm not someone who is \"crazy about soup\" i'm not ranting and raving about soups, nor am i avidly looking for the best soup kitchens, etc.  But as mentioned in the reviews below, my aunt brought home this melon soup, and it was badass it was probably the most delicious and tasting light and fluffy soup I've ever had.  The pieces of melon were so tasty and flavourful.  She showed me pictures of it on her camera, what a unique item to eat.   When I come back to this restaurant another day, I will update my review some more but I honestly JUST HAD To say something about that soup!"}
{"text":"Maple Yip has been in existence for a long time. It needs no introduction or even another Fan. I've never been a regular there and it's due to fate...  I began with all time fav but now closed Magic Wok(Scarboro). When that closed, we moved onto Fantasy Eatery(Scarboro). Occasionally The Royal(Scarboro/Old location) from time to time...  Then I grew up, moved out-of-town and began to explore Foreign Cuisines. By then the vast Cantonese eateries expanded North to a place called Markham. Restauranteurs followed the move as the HK community grew north of Steeles.  The famous words \"Wok-hay\" is hard to achieve. That's the sole reason the old Magic Wok was so popular. I still have the image in my head...  Thick smoke escapes the cracks of the Kitchen door. The undescribable aroma fills the whole restaurant. Customers begin to salivate uncontrollably. And that's all before the first dish of the night leave the Kitchen.  \"WOk-HAY\" is sensory overload and IF executed well, you don't even have to eat it.  Maple Yip and most Restaurants of this Generation has lost this intangible factor. It doesn't mean that Maple Yip doesn't give some fantastical Dishes.   3.5'd Choose the right dishes and enjoy your meal.  According to my personal tastes:  Comp Soup  -  Awesome. Crisp Chicken Stuff w/Sticky Rice  -  Wow.  If you Peking a Chicken, Crispy.  Preserved Veg and Pork Belly  -  On par with other restaurants. Wintermelon Soup  -  I've never had a \"thing\" for this dish for some reason. Garlic Pea Sprouts  -  As good as expected Sizzling Eggplant w/Shrimps  -  Not bad Deep Fried Pigeon  -  Not bad  Lobster in Spicy Meat Sauce  -  Meat texture wasn't to par. Steam Oyster w/Black Bean  -  I swear I've had better here.  Maybe it's the Oysters. Sweet and Sour Pork  -  Some say you can determine a restaurant by it's SS Pork."}
{"text":"Great place to go for comfort Chinese food. We go the set menu for 10 people and added a couple of dishes.   Highlights: the special winter melon soup (need to order it ahead of time) was a crowd favourite. Just enough flavour that it didn't overpower the flavour of the winter melon. The snowpea leaves with dried scallop was also a hit - good cooking and flavour.   Reconsider: if you are ordering the stuffed chicken with sticky rice, while it looks amazing when they bring it over, it's nothing special. All the meat in the chicken has been taken out so you really only get the chicken skin and fat. The sticky rice also didn't pick up any flavour of being in the chicken. For a dish that's over $40, you pretty much get soy sauce flavoured sticky rice and chicken skin. Suggest consider other dishes in place of this one1"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about 7 years. We ended up coming for dinner because my parents' friends are regulars here.   Had:  Some kind of free range chicken with ginger and green onion sauce - veggies on the dish were tasty. I heard they were mustard greens and they were supposed to be bitter. If that's the case, then they tasted the way they should. The chicken was tasty, but could have been more tender. However, it was not dry. The ginger and green onion sauce was plentiful and very tasty.  Some kind of duck with plum sauce - This is not roasted duck with a side of plum sauce. This is duck atop taro slices and veggies with a plum flavored sauce all over it. It's a sweet and sour flavor that most people who have it really enjoy. It's not my cup of tea, but it's not bad.  Braised duck feet with dried shiitake mushrooms - With three older people at the table, this was a hit. I had one. The duck feet were super tender. The sauce was tasty. The mushrooms were soft as well. However, I'm more a chicken-feet-in-the-form-of-dim-sum-phoenix-talon person than I am a duck feet person.  Tofu with salted fish and diced chicken in sizzling pot - I'm usually not a fan of cubed up soft tofu in any style, but this was my favorite dish of the night. The tofu was soft and had a fresh tofu taste. There was just enough salted fish to flavor the entire dish, while not being overly salty. I really liked how the salted fish still had some texture, and it wasn't just little specks here and there. The chicken was sort of an additive for me. It didn't need to be there. Love food in sizzling pots. It keeps the food piping hot, which is exactly how it should be eaten. Big spoons of this with a little rice made me a happy camper for the night.  Dessert was mung bean sweet soup - Not bad, but I'm not a fan of most bean sweet soups. This one was interesting though. Thought there was a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg or something of that sort.   Total per person after tax and tip came to about $10 after 10% discount and tips. We also had leftovers. Not bad for that much food.  Cool story for the night: My family has not come in many years. One of the waitresses claimed she remembered my grandfather. We thought she was bluffing. It turns out she remembered him not from him frequenting Maple Yip many years ago, but because she used to work at Fisherman Villa, and my grandfather was a regular there for many years. We only found out because she remembered that he ordered roasted pigeon a lot there. They do have that on the menu here, so maybe we'll get that the next time we come."}
{"text":"My cousin came back to visit from HK so my parents booked a table to dine at the restaurant. I'm surprised that I have not posted a review for this restaurant.  It is an amazing place that you need to reserve or else end up being disappointed with the wait.  Although we were seated downstairs, we were lucky enough to get a table. They provide free soup which is not heavy with MSG. They do have some specialty dishes like sticky rice stuffed in a chicken and the winter melon soup.  Their fish and seafood is also excellent since it is fresh with the number of people who come to eat. That night, we order the fried taro nest filled with veggies and seafood.  Parking may be just as difficult as getting a table. Make sure you show up on time with your entire group or risk losing the table. Although they don't make you feel rush, they are really quick with cooking all the dishes so they can fit more people each night. Restaurants nearby have closed but I know this one will last."}
{"text":"Great food as mentioned by many reviews before mine, but be forewarned that the service is pushy, and the place is always busy.    We made reservations on a Sunday night and pre ordered the sticky rice chicken as suggested, but when we got there we also wanted to order a tofu dish off the menu and the reply was simply \"we don't have time to make that tonight\"  everything we ordered was delicious though.   We were there for just over an hour when the bill was dropped at the table and dishes were being cleared, and leftovers were packed while we were still eating!  Just be warned."}
{"text":"We go for dinner often and pre-order the stuffed chicken with sticky rice.  They have the best lunch deals in the area.  Lots of hot pot dishes to choose from - includes one bowl of rice.  We have sampled salt/pepper pork chop, shrimp paste roast pork and tofu casserole, black bean squid with mustard greens.  Same quality as dinner but much lower prices.  Can't go wrong with lunch at Maple Yip."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. The winter melon soup is a yummy novelty and the seafood is fresh. Feels like some love goes into the dishes here."}
{"text":"Always passed by this restaurant with so many people inside so my family have decided to give it a try. It was unbelievable terrible. Their dishes are tasteless and nothing like a Cantonese restaurant. Don't know why people are giving such a good rating to this place. They must have never had any real Chinese food or have been to Hong Kong to eat. It is overpriced and terrible quality . The chef really need to go back and learn.  Would never ever come back to this place and would never ever recommend this place to anyone. Would rather spend what I've spent here next door at the bbq place. Not only the food was terrible, service was terrible. Worst dinner experience in my life!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went there on Thursday March 10, 2016.  The service was excellent.  My friend ordered the braised beef with Chinese broccoli.  I ordered pork ribs with mustard greens.  His was great, but the pork ribs were all bones, hardly any meat and the mustard greens were under cooked and tasteless.  It is not a bad place, but just don't order pork ribs and mustard greens."}
{"text":"We went to Maple Yip Seafood restaurant for lunch again this week. One of the more consistent Chinese restaurants not too far from home which serves well prepared quality food for reasonable prices. I started with Hot and Sour soup with seafood served piping hot with just enough hot and sour spice to make it enjoyable. The Deep Fried Crab's Claw with Minced Shrimp had plenty of minced shrimp around the claw. There was a great amount of scrambled eggs in the Scramble Egg with Shrimp & Scallop but not a great deal of shrimp and scallop. (The saut√©ed Assorted seafood with vegetable is a much better value for the same amount of money.) Lastly we enjoyed the Stir Fried Beef with Vegetable & Oyster Sauce. We chose Chinese Broccoli as the vegetable. The servers were quite helpful. It is not a fancy place but the food and service are quite good. We know that for good Asian food you must travel to the northeast part of the city. We shall return often. And, we don't need to speak Chinese to get fed properly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cantonese restaurant.  I love the chicken stuffed with stir fried sticky rice make sure you pre-order it a couple of days before.  They have a few dishes that you need to pre-order so check ahead.  Service is good and the kitchen is fast not to mention the great Wok Hei. This place is usually busy so better to make reservations."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese seafood restaurant. Service is so much better when it is less busier, but this place is almost always full especially for dinner. So I highly recommend to make a reservation if you are coming as a big group. I liked all the dishes I have tried so far. My favourite was scallop with garlic and vermicelli. Their non seafood dishes were great too."}
{"text":"I don't know where you've been hiding all this time, but I finally found this restaurant!  Delicious Chinese (Cantonese) food here.    We had the chicken, seafood bird's nest and a vermicelli dish.  All three dishes were executed very well, with great wok-hay and an excellent flavour balance.    Big league stuff.  Definitely check it out.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Did not regret making the way out to Scarborough.  Ordered three classic Cantonese dishes which were expertly executed. When we return will be sure to pre-order the rice-stuffed chicken and soup in melon, gimmicky or not."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my family, and the food was great. I really liked the baked chicken stuffed with sticky rice. The chicken on its own didn't taste like anything special, but it was delicious when eaten with the sticky rice. The texture of the chicken skin was exceptional, and the sticky rice was good enough to be enjoyed on its own. This dish has to be reserved well in advance, but I still recommend it. The lobster dish we ordered was about average to me. I've had this dish plenty of times, and it didn't really seem to stand out much at this restaurant. The pork belly dish was amazing! The pork belly was soft and fatty..just the way it's supposed to be. I also loved the pickled vegetables and the small bits of pork belly found at the bottom of the dish. This flavors of this dish are rather strong in general, so I feel like it's perfect to eat with white rice. I also really enjoyed the scallops they had. The scallop tasted very fresh, and I was a big fan of the garlic-y flavor.  The service here could use a lot of improvement. One of the waitresses was very rude and even yelled at my mom a little bit for being 15 minutes late to our reservation.. The waitress was unable to reach us by phone because we are from the states and don't have Canadian phone service.. I can understand the frustration our lateness may have caused, but it's still no excuse to treat a customer like that. Despite this incident, I would still recommend this restaurant solely because of its delicious food."}
{"text":"3 stars for not so great service despite good food. I went to the counter to pay by Visa, was given the receipt AND THEN the lady asked me how much tips I would like to give them (she asked me to sign and write on the merchant receipt the amount). I'm assuming she is going to use my credit card number again to process the tips. This is shady. I should've asked her to void my transaction and paid in cash instead.  The fried chicken was really good, and so was the braised pork belly. Could've had that with some rice but we had already ordered noodles. The tung choy with beef was a massive serving, although the cost does make up for it ($17-$18??). I'll probably come back another time with a reservation for a table as well as a pre-order of the chicken stuffed with glutinous sticky rice."}
{"text":"A family favourite for lunch and dinner! My family has been coming for years.  There is nothing special about the decor... typical Chinese family restaurant. They are sometimes short staffed, but they are never rude.  I love their lunch combos which range anywhere between $5.99+ and the portions are good enough to share if you are not a big eater. It's great coming with a large group so you can share a variety of dishes.  Personal favourites: - winter melon with two kinds of noodle - chicken and bittermelon stir-fry with ho fun (special request) - sizzling eggplant with rice - chicken feet (the white kind) - garlic pea sprouts - stir fried fresh shrimp with garlic (with shells)  That's all I can think of at the moment... my mouth is watering already.  If you come for dinner, make sure you make reservations even on weeknights. It gets super busy.  Unfortunately, parking is a mess on the weekends in this little plaza."}
{"text":"Service is as you would expect from a midscale Chinese restaurant; straight to the point.  Options are decent. Ordered the saut√©ed shrimp with cashews. Modest price, modest quality. Would recommend to someone wishing to try out Chinese for the first time."}
{"text":"Father's Day Dinner was booked here. Not a fancy restaurant, but this is a low key place. We preordered two items over the phone prior to the date: Sticky Rice Stuffed Chicken and Wintermelon Soup. Ordered some beer too and it was around $3 per bottle.  Items on the Menu:  Wintermelon Soup The soup is actually cooked in a whole wintermelon for a while. Inside the melon had shrimp, scallops, Chinese Ham, Mushrooms, Dried Scallops, Chicken, and the inner flesh of the wintermelon. The broth was really clear, clean and flavourful. The ingredients were fresh, but just the shrimp was not cleaned at all.   Ginger Sauce Chinese Broccoli The greens seem to have been overboiled. So they were a bit too tender for my liking.  Steamed Fish with Preserved Mustard Greens & Olives Fresh fish, but didn't like the combination of the olives and preserved mustard greens.   Sticky Rice Stuffed Chicken A Whole chicken is stuffed with seasoned cooked sticky rice. The waitress sliced and curved the whole chicken in front of us. The skin was really crisp, but the flavour of the Chicken and Sticky Rice were a bit bland inside.   Black Bean Sauce Stir Fried Clams It was tasty with the black bean sauce and was overall ok.  Chicken Shrimp Taro Fried Nest Stir fried chicken and shrimp with celery and broccoli. The shrimp were huge and clean. Nest ws fried nicely and chicken was tender and moist. Shrimp waa fresh and tasty. Broccoli had crisp and the glass sauce was yummy.  Beef Green Fried Chow Mein Typical fried Chow Mein. Nice Crisp to the noodles and beef and greens were good.  After dinner we had sweet soup and it was red bean only. It was ok, not to sweet and not a lot of filling.    Fried Salted Squid It was fried well and tasty. It was not soggy nor chewy. But it did have a more orange tint to it compared to other places."}
{"text":"We were able to score a table for 9 during dinner time without a reservation.  Whew!  Host was super nice knowing that we has 2 elderly in the group and sat our party upstairs.  ,, We were looking to feast after looking all the yelp photos.  One dish we wanted to order was the deboned chicken with sticky rice.  Didn't realize that needed to be pre-ordered in advance.  Bummer!  We ordered the following dishes: 3 delight in taro nest Buddha delight Vegetarian casserole Hon sue tofu Duck with taro in plum sauce  Dungeness crab with spicy pork Empress chicken Fatty pork with preserved veggies  The vegetarian dishes were on the blander side to the point of no seasoning.  The duck dish was a tad bit sweeter than I'd like but u think it may be that I'm not used to plum sauce.  The empress chicken was super tender.  Dungeness crab was a bit overfried.. meat was dry. Best two dishes were the 3 delights in taro nest and fatty pork with preserved veggies.  Service was hot and cold.  Some friendlier and helpful than others.  Overall expectations fell flat."}
{"text":"This place was packed out on a Friday night - be prepared for a bit of a wait. We had a soup, whole fish, giant oysters with black bean sauce, sweet and sour pork, goose feet, some pea shoots, pigeon, and the requisite red bean dessert soup. The oysters were the stars of the show, large and tasty. Per usual with chinese places, come for the food, not for the decor or service.   Overall, tasty food for the price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It's been around for many years, but I've only recently been there a few times.   The reason why I think this is the best is because the food tastes natural; not too overpowering in seasoning/MSG, but that doesn't mean it's bland. I have low tolerance for saltiness and oil, and dislike goopey sauces, so I really think majority of the dishes I've tried here are great.   - Chicken: so moist and soft, even the white part! The skin is thin and crispy without being oily and having the layer of fat. This is my favorite chicken and my favorite dish here.   - Green veggies are generally good, such as choi sum and the fermented bean curd lettuce  - Beef or Seafood & Broccoli or Celery in Taro Nest - generally I don't like these nests, but this one is freshly fried made of taro! It is fresh and crispy, and of course I like it because I'm a taro fan!  - Soups - chicken feet; lotus root   - Steamed fish   - Glutinous rice stuffed chicken - this needs to be pre-ordered. A huge whole chicken, moist, crisp skin, stuffed with my favorite glutinous rice. IMO the chicken is a bit bland compared to the regular oil fried chicken, but still tasty.   - Lobster - Few times I ordered the 5 + lbs lobster (total is around $70) So delicious! Lobster needs to be large for optimal taste. Large, meaty, juicy pieces. I've had both the deep fried and garlic steamed. Both are good, the fried one is more flavorful.  - Winter melon soup - needs to be pre-ordered. Very flavorful with lots of ingredients!  Generally can't go wrong with this place! Great food & Great value!"}
{"text":"With the expectation the food is going to be good according to Yelp, I came here with my boyfriend for dinner. Once we arrived, the diner is super packed, so we immediately decided to get take-out.   We stood in front of the cash counter when there was a girl working in front of us. We stood there for like a straight 5 mins without anyone acknowledged us, although there were so many waitress and waiter walking around, and the girl was literally in front of us.   The service is non-existing. Nobody greeted us, or offered us seats. Eventually one waitress came up to me and looked angry, she started talking in Cantonese to me which I didn't understand her at all. I said to her I don't understand what she was saying. And she got even more rude and shouted: \"What do you want?!\" I was shocked to the point I didn't realize what was happening or how shall I respond to her. In my head I told myself that the food is good here and I should endure her attitude and get my food first.  So I ordered my food, paid, again there was no \"thank you\" or any sort of greeting. People were so rude later on I regretted my decision for ordering my take-out there.   I'd never go back there. And its just so shitty that people come out to wanting to have a good time and end up getting upset because of some ridiculous service. I also don't recommend people to go there if you don't speak cantonese or already knowing whats on the menu. They get mad at people who don't speak their language and I also saw people getting yelled at for asking questions here."}
{"text":"waiting stafff are fast and alert.  food comes to you fast.   book your tables if you don't want to wait for a long time.  do this for thursday, friday and the weekends and any long weekends.  book your table in advance!!!!  the food itself is amazing.  hot and very authentic.  they also have a little room in the basement  don't miss a chance to go there and eat some great food.  highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"As a person who doesn't frequent chinese food establishments that often, this I must say was a spectacular experience. I will say that it was essential for me to go here with a colleague who knew what to order, as I would have no idea what to start with.  Some of my favourite dishes were the chicken stuffed with sticky rice, the sweet and sour pork, and the taro beef. The service was efficient and each of the dishes was packed with delicious flavours. I will definitely return to try out other dishes...again with my colleague."}
{"text":"Celebrated my mothers birthday here two weeks ago and enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend making a reservation so that you don't have to wait - especially for weekends. We ordered the winter melon soup (chicken, shrimp and mushroom boiled in a whole winter melon), birds nest with scallops in a taro nest, running chicken, Cantonese chow mein (I would pass on this) and bitter melon with beef. The food was delivered quickly and everything tasted delicious except the noodles. The char sui had a funny taste. This restaurant is known for their seafood and when I return, I hope to try more. I was even pleasantly surprised by the service, a waiter came to check on us several times. The decor isn't modern but the food and service make up for it. I also saw many families dinning at the restaurant so something to keep in mind if you are looking for a restaurant that can accommodate large groups. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"How come I never heard of this place before now? The food is good, really really good! The menu and ambiance reminded me of some of the restaurants I used to go to in Chinatown many years ago. Good restaurants!  We started with crab meat and fish maw soup. Yummy! We also had braised pork belly with preserved vegetables (moi choy), classic sweet and sour pork, and salted fish with chicken and tofu in a sizzling hot pot. All the dishes were delicious and reminiscent of some of the dishes I grew up with.  The pork belly was tender and full of flavour. The sweet and sour pork was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and not oversauced. The salted fish and chicken dish had lots of depth in the flavours.  My dining companion for today was a friend and chef who has cooked for several US presidents. Yes, just the two of us and all that food. I'm stuffed!  Their signature dish is a deboned whole crispy chicken stuffed with sticky rice and Chinese sausages. Dang! Unfortunately, it has to be ordered in advance so we'll just have to come back for it."}
{"text":"Maple Yip is a holdover insituation from an almost by-gone era. They serve tradiational Cantonese dishes in the same quantity and quality as expected from almost a decade ago. Even stepping into this restaurant brings me back to when I was a kid and following my parents into Cantonese restaurants for family dinners.  It's obviously very popular among the local Chinese crowd. The food is well made with plenty of 'wok air', comes to the table piping hot and with plenty to go around the table. We had the 'three strand' noodles and my mom said it tasted like what she use to eat as a child. That is high praise!!  I can understand the comments about service, as they still hold the brash fast-paced efficient attitude typical of HK restaurants. Not really a place to be coddled or have things explained (especially if you don't speak chinese)."}
{"text":"I have visited Maple Yip multiple times.  On all occasions, we ordered from the a la carte menu.  The first two to three visits were on weekends, and the food was average.  Only the most recent visit that was on a Tuesday lived up to its reputation.  To keep the long story short, the various chicken dishes were good but not better than other Chinese restaurants.  The duck dish was very good, not usually available at other Chinese restaurants, and was something one cannot easily make at home.  The fish dish was good but not better than other Chinese restaurants.  The shellfish dishes, such as clams, shrimps, were decent, and were considerately better made than other Chinese restaurants.    In other words, there were hits and misses.  There were inconsistencies.  During the first few visits that I visited on weekends, maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, or maybe the kitchen was overwhelmed by the business volume.  During the last visit that I visited on a Tuesday, maybe I ordered the right dishes, or may be the kitchen could handle the volume just fine.  Truth be told, the good dishes were very good and well worth every pretty penny.  The not-so-good dishes were not bad, just not living up to the stellar reputation, or the price tag."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weeknight, made reservations few days before. This place is packed on the weekend so you need to reserve early! The place is located in a Scarborough plaza (I would never have went, looked pretty ghetto) They did not renovate the interior of this place, very old school Cantonese style cooking. The place looked out dated but the food was really good. We preordered their signature chicken \"law mai gai\" sticky rice ($42) that was the best dish of the night. The skin is so crispy!! And the rice was really good! Also ordered the $118 combo which comes with: Fish Maw Soup, chicken, veggie seafood dish, lobster, seabass fish, fried pork chops. We had to pay an extra $15 because they said they didn't have any \"small fish\" we upgraded anyways figuring bigger fish would taste better. And we made the right choice, the fish was delicious! Overall, I'm very satisfied with the meal. If you like traditional Cantonese food and don't mind the ambiance, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. Tasted very similar to the food in Hong Kong. We had chicken, sweet and sour pork, pork belly with preserved vegetables, rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce and hot and sour soup.   Everything tasted so good. The servers were nice and the good came quickly. I would definitely recommend coming with family here. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great service, very efficient! Food came very fast and the food is very Cantonese authentic with a large variety of selections"}
{"text":"I made a reservation a week in advance for a family dinner for 11 people for Chinese autumn festival dinner.  We opted for a set menu as we were told that there would be a seating limit of 2 hrs.  We pre-selected a set menu a day ahead and arrived early for our reservation.  We still had to wait 30 min to be seated and an hour after arrival, we were still waiting for food.  Crammed into an uncomfortable corner, we were all starving at this point.  Finally, they started bringing out the food and everything was pretty average.  Nothing to write home about.  I just don't understand why it took them an hour to bring out a cold appetizer platter.  Anyways, I found the steamed lobster dish to be the most disappointing as it was too oily (the noodles that were laid under the lobsters were swimming in garlic oil leaving a terrible mouth feel) and the lobsters themselves were undercooked.  Another big minus for a \"seafood\" restaurant.    I doubt I'll ever return to Maple Yip as there are plenty of good Chinese restaurants in Scarborough that offer excellent food without the aggravation we went though at this restaurant.    FYI for parents, the restaurant does not have a change table in their tiny washrooms.  To add insult to injury, they had no high chair or a booster seat for my daughter as the only 2 they keep at the restaurant were both in use.  Laughable."}
{"text":"I've been here four times -- and this past week, I was lucky enough to come twice in three days.  There are some winner dishes.  Two standouts:  the duck with plum and taro, and the deep fried spicy eel.  The Singapore style noodle is wonderful too, but not really part of the core Cantonese menu.   Its a very unassuming place, located back of mall, so you have to hunt for it the first time.  Well worth it though!  Service is a bit spotty -- I wish I spoke Cantonese, not just for service but because there are menu items not listed on the English menu that I would love to know about in detail and, of course, sample."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night at around 8:00pm and the place was packed and had a line up. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Got the prefixed menu $88 meal which came with soup, veggie + mushrooms, half a chicken, one small lobster, one small bass. Also added sweat and sour pork dish and also fresh scallops which were $5 for each scallop. The meal also comes with sweet red bean soup as dessert.   The service was excellent consider how busy it was. Food came pretty fast and empty dishes removed. The food itself was excellent and tasted very fresh. The best plate had to be the steamed fish which I believe was a small mouth bass. It was super soft and silky smooth. The only complaint I have is that all the dishes were pretty small in portion. For $88 its a decent price for what you get but the scallop for $5 each was a bit over priced even though it did taste very good."}
{"text":"On a Thursday night the restaurant was rather packed.  Located in the order of a plaza at sheppard and midland, maple yip has been here for years. This place is always packed on a weekend. Make sure to make reservations.   I find that a lot of these restaurants are harder to find in Toronto now. They've been taken over by the other Chinese restaurant that sells mostly lamb skewers or spicy fish. These more traditional style and having to keep the taste is harder to find in my opinion.  You get a free soup and dessert here with your meal. I forgot to take pictures as I was very hungry. The ingredients I felt were very fresh and portions are good for the price.  Will try to take pics next time."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Look, I admit some of the food here is excellent. Key word is the word \"some\"; in order for me to up it to 4 stars, a majority of the food has to be excellent. I expect the set dinners to have the best of what restaurants have to offer, however I did not feel like I received \"blow-your-mind-away\" style of food despite the reviews here.  In fact, I was a regular at Maple Yip 7-8 years back. In fact I was a regular when this place used to be called Midtown Seafood Restaurant before Maple took over. I stopped visiting here when I moved to Markham and was accustomed to the higher quality Chinese restaurants up there. One of my relatives decided to ask me to return here tonight just to check on how the food quality has been since we left.  We ordered the set dinner which consisted of a crab soup with fish maw, half of a free range chicken, general tao pork ribs, bok choy with oyster mushrooms, lobster, and steamed fish. To return to our tradition roots, we also ordered a chilled chicken feet as an appetizer.  The chilled chicken feet is still one of the best appetizers you can order in this restaurant. There's largely no chemicals added and the colours are natural. The crab soup was also excellent, and not that heavy on MSG/salt/all  that like. The bok choy with oyster mushrooms was great as well, as well as the free range chicken. However, the other three dishes were disappointing; the pork ribs had more bones than meat, the lobster had more shell than meat, and the steamed fish was too small for 4 people. The dessert at the end was good, as always the last few times I visited.  People may say I ordered the wrong items, which isn't entirely wrong. However for the set dinners I expect at least 80% of the food to be good, which wasn't the case tonight. I gave it 3 stars cause the food that was good was really good, so if you stick with their specialties you'll definitely have a great time here.  Oh, and reserve beforehand, especially if it's after 6:30. You'll regret it if you don't, especially on a weekend."}
{"text":"Getting into this restaurant would make you feel like going back to Hong Kong, and they serve tasty food which reminds me of the old-style outdoor food stall ???? I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Maple Yip is the definition of hidden gem in my opinion.  One of the better Chinese restaurants in Scarborough.  Pros: Dishes are well prepared Prices are fair  Cons: Place is very busy during peak hours  First off, I have no idea how anybody would ever find this place.  It's located in the back corner of a plaza that really doesn't look like it would house a very good restaurant like this.  Those who do know about it seem to swear by it as the number of times I've been there I can already recognize some of the regulars.  I only know about this place because one of my co-workers is a regular here himself.  Maple Yip offers the standard set of items you would normally find at other Chinese restaurants.  They also offer banquet style set meals you can find at the larger Chinese restaurants.  You can definitely celebrate an occasion here.  Maybe not a wedding, but a retirement type celebration is great here.  I was here for a co-workers retirement dinner and it was great.  The food was well done and the service was great.  I recommend the lobster here, they make a very good one.  A typical dinner here will run about $10 a person depending on how much seafood you order and how many big eaters your party consists of.  This is well in line with other restaurants in the area.  As I said, the food here is done particularly well and you won't be disappointed.  This place is busy though.  They have a strong customer base and it's almost always packed during dinner hours.  I've never come one where there wasn't a large contingent waiting for a table. They even took over the the unit next door and opened up more tables and it still isn't enough at times.  I do believe they take reservations so that might be the best avenue to go.  Maple Yip is definitely a place you should check out.  It's not super fancy like the larger restaurants, but it gets the job done very well at a much better price."}
{"text":"If you want to experience really good authentic Chinese food, keep reading. But I warn you, it's a long review.  So many of us have tried the so called Chinese food in Chinese restaurants all over the world. However, many people do not realize that the food in those restaurants is actually not authentic Chinese! So when I was invited to join one of my wonderful Chinese friends to try authentic Chinese food, I gladly accepted. We gathered a big group of people from work so that we could try many different dishes.  Arriving there, we could see that the restaurant was packed with people, mostly Chinese families. Inside, I could only hear mandarin/kantonese being spoken, even by the staff. On the walls are colorful papers with Chinese sign on, what I'm guessing would be the different dishes on the menu.  Our friend ordered 8 different dishes and quickly after, we got out first dish together with hot tea. The first dish was winter melon soup with pork and seafood (has to be ordered in advance). It was very nice to look at and everyone immediately took out their phones to take photos. Before we finished our soup, the other dishes came out one by one until our table was so filled with food that we ran out of space. The dishes we had were whole boneless (!) chicken filled with sticky rice (ordered in advance), chili pork chops, eggplant, seafood taro basket, beef in some sauce with onions, green beans with pork and finally lobster. All the dishes were amazing, very flavorful but not spicy. Even though i enjoyed all of the above dishes, I'm highly recommending the eggplant, stuffed boneless chicken, pork chops and the beef. They are sooooo delicious!  To top this off they serve a red bean soup for dessert,  on the house. I tried it and did not like it. It literally tastes like water with sugar and pieces of red beans in it. That's it.  Based on this visit and previous ones, I rate this restaurant a 5* out of 5. Just make sure you preorder the boneless chicken and winter melon soup to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant randomly one day when I was on Yelp. I was surprised by the amount of positive reviews it had and decided to try it out. I ordered all the typical dishes that were mentioned.  Whole stuffed chicken with sticky rich ($42) This was a very impressive dish. I've never had anything like this before. It was not a disappointment at all. The skin was nice and crispy, the sticky rice was perfectly cooked and the portion was enough for about 5-6 people. I didn't taste it at the time but as leftover, it was quite oily.  Deep fried oysters ($16.95) There were eight pieces and they were all quite big. I thought it was nicely seasoned and breaded just right. If you're craving oysters, I would recommend this dish but it's not a must try.  Pork belly with preserved vegetable ($10) I believe one of the reviews described this dish as \"melt in your mouth\" so I had to see if it was really that good ... and it was! It definitely does melt in your mouth because it's so sliced thinner than other restaurant. The preserved vegetables that's normally very salty was actually not that bad. This is a must get dish if you're a lover of pork belly!  Green beans ($7.95) and green bean sprouts with king oyster mushrooms ($18.95) These two dishes were average except the price of the second veggie dish. They both tasted good but $20 for a dish of vegetable is quite steep!  There was also complimentary soup and dessert which was nice.  It was recommended by many people to make reservations before coming so we did. We were actually seated earlier than our reservation time (7:27)! The hostess and waiters were also very friendly (I feel like I haven't experienced that in a long time at a Chinese restaurant). Just make sure you look at the receipt before paying because a 11% tip was already added to the bill!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month for family dinners and the food is always delicious, our usual dishes are shrimp with thousand island dressing, steamed oysters, steamed scallops, sweet & sour pork, duck feet, chicken with sticky rice inside. The quality is always consistent and when certain ingredients are not fresh or in season, they simply won't serve it! I love that all the dishes are accompanied by tons of greens such as broccoli or choy!  This place gets very busy on the weekends are standing/waiting space is very limited..so I suggest making reservations!   The restaurant itself is very dated and not very clean..but the quality food and reasonable prices clearly make up for the location and appearance. Maple Yip is located in a very sketchy plaza with limited parking on ground level..though there is an underground garage.  Additionally, a lot of items on the menu are special order..meaning you must place an order beforehand otherwise there isn't enough prep time or availability...such as the wintermelon soup or chicken with sticky rice inside!"}
{"text":"My family has been to this place in the past for quite sometime ago... the food taste good, always line up on the weekend...just visit a few days ago, we tried the winter melon soup and the sticky rice chicken-they need you to pre order one day in advance-that's totally fine. The food also taste good.. but the only thing that they force you to tip them and they calculate the total for you which I found it like a set up and they never mentioned they would charge you the tips on the bill... if it's because of the winter melon soup and the sticky rice chicken they have to prepare in advance, otherwise I can't accept a restaurant charge tips without telling you in advance and usually they do service charge is AYCE not a ordinary Chinese restaurant. I would not go back!!!"}
{"text":"The only good reason to go to this restaurant is for their signature dishes which are the winter melon soup and the plum duck.   It is a typical cantonese restaurant with all the dishes that you would expect from one.   We arrived at the table.   The waiters were typical cantonese waiters.     As expected, we ordered the melon soup which came in a big huge melon.  It is expensive so be prepared to pay up.   We also ordered the plum duck and pork belly.  Apparently, the plum duck must be ordered beforehand when you make reservation because it takes them a few days to make it.  The winter melon soup is really good.   If there is only one dish to order, that would be it.    I found the duck to not have a lot of meat in it and there was a bit of gamey taste to it.   it was alright.    The pork belly was pretty good.  I thought it was a pretty good experience.  I would come back just to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"I had the most horrible service today. I will never come back to this place. I know the service from a Chinese restaurant is not good. But what happened today is out of my imagination.   I ordered a boiled chicken.  There is feather!!! The roots of the feather on the wing.  And there is more softer smaller feather under the plate.  I cannot imagine what is going on in the kitchen.   Then I ordered a stir fry pork with vege.   It taste quite strange. I'm not so sure if it's the meat gone bad or they hired a new chef.   At this point, I'm still trying my very best to be calm and polite.   So, I ask the waitress very politely if they can change this stir fry pork.   At the beginning, she keep saying the dish is the same. The chef is the same. It's me whose taste bud become different.   Unbelievable...so. I insist it is the food become different. She kept saying the same thing in circles.   After about five minutes, she said ok. She will change to a new dish.   Suddenly, a waiter came along and said something to her in Cantonese.   I totally understand Cantonese. But I only speak Mandarin. I know he said. No. No way. Don't change.   Then I asked to see the manager. The manager is even more rude. She started shouting at me and said something quite insulting.   She said to me: \"every pig is different. Just like you are fat. I'm not. You are tall. I'm not. \"  At that moment. I swear I never come back to that place.   So. I told the manager I'll get the bill. But I'm not paying for the pork.   The manager said no way. You cannot leave if you don't pay enough.   I said. Ok. Let's call the police.   She said no. You pay.   I said. No way I pay for that disgusting pork. I'll never come back here and I'll let all my friends and family know how bad your service is.   She was shouting at me. I was shouting back at her. Everyone in the restaurant was looking at me.   After like ten minutes. She kind of deducted the pork price. Then I pay and left.   I don't know if she over charged on other items. Their bill doesn't really show individual price.  There's only bad Chinese writing that no one can read.   My friend who is also Chinese told me. If he is me. He will just avoid this place next time. There's no point of complaining to them which lead to such an embarrassment.    However. I think differently.   I should get what I paid for.  I come for chicken. Not the feather.  I want to taste the right pork. Not whatever they gave me.   If everyone protect their own rights, how dare they serve chicken with feather and strange pork?   I see there are a lot of people like this restaurant.  All I can say is may god bless your strong stomach and super good immune systems.  And hope you guys never encounter the feather and strange tasting pork.   I was so shocked after the waiter and waitress and manager shouting at me and insulting me.  So I forgot to take a picture of the feather on the chicken. Seriously. That's a lot feather. It's those big thick ones."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd stop on a day we explored the Scarborough area. After filling ourselves with dimsum at Dragon Dynasty, we took a 2 hour break and came here around 3 pm. We were the only customers. Yay!  The lady taking our order (presumably the owner), answered my wife's many questions. They talked at length. Since it was all in Mandarin, I have no idea what was said but at the end of it all we ended up with:  Live Lobster with ginger and scallion sauce - Pretty good but slightly overcooked and not a lot of flavor. 3.5/5  Steamed Fish with Ginger and Scallion sauce (bass) - Cooked to perfection. The bass was almost melting in my mouth. Tasted extremely fresh and light. 5/5  Pork with Preserved Vegetable (Mei Cai Kou Rou) - The missus said she used to have this growing up so we decided to get this. The pork belly actually got pretty lean in the cooking process (though it didn't take anything away from the dish) and the preserved mustard greens had a good balance of salty and sweet. 4/5  Crispy Fried Chicken(half order) - Another favorite of mine at this place. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well cooked the chicken was. Even the white meat was enjoyable because it wasn't dry. The best part was the perfectly crispy skin. It was delicious and not oily at all. 4.5/5  Sauteed Water Spinach with Garlic- Lightly sauteed, not a crazy amount of oil and garlicy to the extreme. 4/5  That was enough between the 4 of us. If not for the dimsum earlier, I think we probably would've stuffed ourselves with more food. The damage was a reasonable $30 per person all in. I have no idea when I'll go back to Scarborough next but this was a meal that I won't soon forget."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Great family style chinese restaurant.  Reminds me of Hong Kong."}
{"text":"so many yummy dishes for such a cheap price! They have all the most popular Chinese dishes, like the beef fried noodle, beef fried rice noodle with bean sprouts, eggplant with sweet spicy sauce, fried vermicelli Singapore style and lots more! And they make them all pretty well :)   All their lunch special items range from 5.49-5.99 ! :D and the portions are pretty big!"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a tough one ...   This is a cozy Chinese Seafood Restaurant  tucked in the corner of the plaza immediately after Midland and Sheppard Ave. It is relatively small in area size compared to most Chinese restaurants but can definitely still hold a small party or gathering. Note though no Dazzling Chandeliers here , if that's one of your criteria.   Service came quick , the servers knew English well enough to understand what we like to order. Pictures and subtitles on the Menu really helped too. As recommended by most yelpees we ordered the Rice Stuffed Chicken . Most reviews say this dish needs to be ordered a day in advance but Lo and Behold while still going over our options our server interrupted us saying they had one they could spare our table but we needed to say yes right then or they might run out . Obviosuly we said yes  and thought how lucky we were until we heard the same line used on the other table (boink!). Portion could easily serve 8-9 person but at $45 , I consider it pricey. Luckily however, the rice tasted nice with bits of Chinese sausage and mushrooms. The chicken skin was cooked crispy to perfection. This felt like Chicken Casserole with a twist. A good twist. The Vancouver clam in black bean sauce was good enought to satisfy my cravings but we found the serving a bit on the small side. Lobster, we opted for steamed with vermicelli and garlic - though slightly over cooked was quite tasty. My favorite surprisingly was the snow pea and mushroom . The taste was subtle and light , a good dish that balanced the flavors of the other dishes.  Overall the experience was pleasant , the dishes were well prepared - natural flavors were brought out without so much use of MSG. We would come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I HAD to try this place. Hubs was looking forward to this place! We reserved the sticky rice stuffed chicken 2 days before. Hubs remembered eating this a few times when he was a kid and this brought back nice memories! We also ordered the Mapo Tofu and Vermicelli with Melon and Dried Shrimp Casserole. The chicken was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!! I'm bummed that we don't have this back in the US! We're already trying to plan our next trip to Canada so we can have this again! They have this whole presentation where they bring the whole chicken to you and cut it up in front of you. SO DELICIOUS! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this 1 week later! Oh yeah... On to the rest of the meal! :). The vermicelli casserole was also our favorite. It was nice and tasty. The mapo tofu was nice and spicy. Everything was good but the chicken entree stole the show! They offered free soup but it was weird that they took all the meat out and served it to us on a separate plate. I would've given this place a solid 5 but had to deduct 1 star because of the service. Service was friendly but very pushy. They kept coming back every few seconds to ask if we've decided what we wanted to eat even though we said that we needed a little more time to look at the menu. I felt we could've ordered more if we were allowed more time to look at the menu. Owner is very friendly. When I went to reserve the chicken, I told her of my daughter's peanut allergies and they made note of it not to add any peanuts or use any oil where peanuts were used. Aside from the pushy service, I love this place and will definitely return when in the GTA area!"}
{"text":"This is one of the go-to restaurants when we visit my family.  They offer a large menu of options and also daily specials.  It is best to call ahead to reserve a table since they can get really busy!  We placed an order on a glutinous rice stuffed chicken.  PERFECTION on a cold winter's day.  The chicken is de-boned, then stuffed with cooked glutinous rice.  Super tasty!    Other dishes we ordered we served very quickly.  The taro basket filled with seafood is so tasty and plentiful!  Everything was hot and fresh.  Honestly, this is a great place for authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for an affordable price. Peking Duck (2 courses: soft wraps with duck, lettuce leaf with minced duck) = $28. The deep fried taro nests with seafood are $12. And the sweet and sour pork is wicked here too.   Like I said, the food is great and the prices even greater. Not that busy during the week, but if you go on the weekend expect to wait."}
{"text":"Had reservation at 8 pm.  Odered: Chicken with sticky rice, $42 Malaysian tofu, $11 Clams, $12 Oysters, $17 Pork belly, $7.50  Chicken & tofu were ok. Clams had smell (like bad breath after chewing them).  They were probably dead when cooked. Oyster dish consisted of 5 oysters with pieces roast pork used as filler.  Pork belly ..ok but not melt in your mouth. Preserved vegetables were savoury.  Busy restaurant.  Quite small. Hyped-up a bit. Taste-wise is ok. Prices are expensive for the taste, quality & ambiance.  Washrooms are gross. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place, I cannot say enough good things about this great restaurant.  Once upon a time in Hong Kong, there were many places like this....And I do mean a long time ago like in the 70's/80's.  My wife made a funny comment tonight about Maple Yip.  As an artist, she tends to be very sensitive beyond the 5 senses.  Her comment was:  I always feel a sense of well being after dining here, such a rare wonderful feeling.  As for me, based on my years of eating out at many places, I can tell you a place like Maple Yip is 1 out of 100. (I have eaten at over 1000 eateries and I can only count within 8 places that are similar)  For the true value oriented Foodie, here is my suggestion:  Go for the fresh catch/seasonal of day special like live shrimp, fish, shellfish, etc.  Compliment it w/ a veggie dish plus a rice or noodle dish.  You can't beat it, your taste buds and digestive body will thank you!!!  Almost forgot, specific recommendations:  1.  E Mein (noodle) w/ Eggplant.  Best E Mein ever for me!! 2.  Dry Stir Fry Sticky Rice with cured meat.  One of the best ever. 3.  Duck w/ plum, very ducky/gamey in a good way. 4.  Bok Choy/Gai Choy, both good in various versions. 5.  Live Fish, Scallops, Vanc Crab, all excellent well executed."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food.   Great place to go for set dinner because they have traditional dishes (sweet and sour pork, steamed fish, mushroom/vegetarian dishes, roast pork) and specialty dishes (e.g. roast chicken stuffed with glutinous rice; special soup, etc.).  Expect to wait for a table unless you reserve ahead.  Food is not too salty but is still flavourful, and you won't feel drowsy after a meal here.  Very crowded tables and bathrooms are downstairs."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food. I enjoyed everything we got (minus the chicken).  Standouts - fried crispy fish, Peking porkchops, and salt and pepper fried squid/shrimp/scallop. Everything was really tasty and inexpensive  - make a reservation though this place gets packed. If you don't have a reservation, you may be put on a time limit as we were!  I would definitely come back again and try the specialities that require a preorder!"}
{"text":"Maple Yip Seafood Restaurant does some of their dishes really well but not all of them are good. So the trick is to know what to order.  I was lucky to be with a big group (thanks NYC Yelpers) which is kind of unusual and got to try out quite a few of the dishes  Excellent: - Wintermelon Soup - Fried Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice - Garlic Pea Sprouts - Sizzling Eggplant with Shrimps  A-OK to Meh - Steam Oyster with Black Bean (too much black bean sauce) - Lobster in Spicy Meat Sauce (overcooked) - Steamed Green Bass (overcooked)  Avoid - Sweet and Sour Pork (worse than the one I had at food court) - Deep Fried Pigeon (dried and bland)  Compare to the other Chinese restaurants I been to, Maple Yip is one of those that practice healthy cooking: easy on the oil and the salt/msg.  Make sure to make a reservation and if not there will be a long long wait for a table. Services can be spotty but if you are a regular, you find the waitresses really friendly!"}
{"text":"I came here frequently a few years ago with my Chinese family; before yelp was useful. Things have sure turned to $#!T now. Came here with my S.O. and we were both disappointed.  no more free soup or dessert no salt shakers table cloth had holes in it  ordered: -combination appetizer platter $17 ...ouch horrible cold gelatin things. mostly nasty chicken feet. -braised duck with taro $13 more like a ton of duck bones in a boring sweet sauce and huge old taro -yang chow fried rice $8.5 no salt! and no salt shaker on the table  I will never come back here again. The only reason we even entered was because the fast little chinese takeout in the corner of the plaza food court was closed."}
{"text":"My family really likes coming to this place, so we've been here quite a number of times. I usually do enjoy the food here, and I like how the food tastes natural, is not too salty, doesn't taste like there's tons of MSG, etc. I think the prices here are pretty decent as well, because usually we'll get maybe like about 6-ish dishes, and it'll come to about $80 - $90 for 5 people. As a seafood restaurant, they definitely live up to their name! Last time I was here we ordered a tofu and scallop dish, and there were LOTS of scallops, and they were all really big and juicy and tasted fresh. We also had fried rice with shrimps and an egg and shrimp dish, and the shrimp in both were large and plump. Sometimes we will also order a whole steamed fish, and it always tastes fresh and is cooked well.  They will give you free soup to start, and dessert soup at the end (usually red bean soup) which is great. All of the servers are very friendly. :)  Would recommend making a reservation, since this place can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family. Overall the food is cheap, looks good and delicious. Must try their boneless chicken stuffed with sticky rice. Skin was so crispy.  Loved their deep fried taro nest with scallops as well. Be sure to make a reservation.  Sitting area is kind of crowded.  Washrooms are located downstairs in the basement."}
{"text":"This review is for their crispy chicken.  Went to Toronto for my honeymoon two weeks ago and good thing I read reviews to order the chicken in advance.  And I sure glad I did!  The crispy chicken was probably the best thing I ate in Toronto! Ordered some of the other dishes too but it's nothing extraordinary from other Chinese restaurant.  The chicken is the star, a must when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Tips for Maple Yip:  - Order the winter melon soup in advance.  Otherwise, you'll be sad to see every other table get them, and not yours.  You'll recognize it by the GIGANTIC winter melon they bring out to each and every table with a ladle  - Lobster at $11.95 may seem cheap.  But when you factor in that the smallest one they had was 5.5 lbs x $11.95, you better REALLY want to eat a lot of lobster  - Speak Chinese, or bring friends who do.  Otherwise, confusing ensues, and you may have accidentally, in the confusion, lose your reservation or winter melon soup  - While it's not the BEST Chinese food ever, it's REALLY DARN GOOD if you're visiting from NY and miss good Chinese food direly  - Yay for little bowl of green bean dessert at the end. Yum."}
{"text":"Make your reservations...called Sunday afternoon and they were nice enough to get us in at 5:30 p.m. when one of their later reservations were going to cancel (meaning we wouldn't be rushed out).   We wound up with dungeness crab (with ground pork), whole fish, fried oysters (probably should have gone fresh). Peapod greens were tender and yet with large leaves. A house special vermicelli dish rounded things out. House starter soup and closing dessert soup make things right.  Decor ain't fancy, but we're paying for the food."}
{"text":"Aside from the gross parking lot, mall, decor and squishiness of Maple Yip, you have to look past this for the food.  WOW!  It's fantastic.  I've come here a number of times with my parents, and I love the sassy waiters, the super low prices, and the amazingly seasoned food.  Not too much oil and not too much salt, no MSG, and yet so incredibly tasty.  If you go into their Chef's Recommends section, my favourite dish is the fried vermicelli with chives and shrimp - the salted fish/tofu/chicken pieces hot pot is also super good.   If you come here around 2PM it's surprisingly quiet, and the staff are generally eating lunch and picking apart Chinese greens to prepare for the evening.    Definitely my fave Chinese restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers here, sometimes I come to Maple Yip for family dinners. They are good with standard Cantonese dishes, but their charm is in their special dishes (the winter melon soup and sticky rice stuffed chicken). Both must be ordered I believe a day or two in advance. I'm not a particularly big fan of soup, but my family loves it, and the dish is huge, so it really is good for groups. I prefer the sticky rice stuffed chicken, because the skin is crispy while the meat is still very juicy. I'm also a chicken fanatic, so I normally can't bear to put down any chicken dishes.   Service is like every other Asian place. Nothing outstanding, but not too bad."}
{"text":"We came here as a part of our Toronto trip and it did not disappoint. We ordered the Winter Melon soup and it was delicious! We also ordered the green sea bass, pork belly, and green beans. Everything was very good, and we would come again!"}
{"text":"Maple Yip is a homestyle Cantonese restaurant in Scarborough, located in a careworn, older strip mall with limited parking.  Counsel and reviews warned that this place packs in crowds and it was very true; reservations are a must between 7 PM - 9 PM, and especially on weekends.  During those times, the crowds clustered around the door, the antechamber, and outside can get quite big.  We dined here twice during our Markham trip, the first visit eliciting sufficient enthusiasm from the group to reserve a second dinner.  The restaurant itself is nothing special to look at, an ordinary dining space, not too large, with two adjacent dining rooms.  Mostly family-sized round tables, with some smaller ones for groups of 4.  Not too many wait staff but those were efficient and competent, with only a bizarre 20-minute wait for our check the first visit marring their service record.  Between our two visits, we got to try 11 different dishes, with some repeats (see pics).  They offer several dishes that need early reservation, and we got two of these on our second visit, the winter melon soup tureen and glutinous rice stuffed boneless fried chicken.  Generally speaking, just about all the dishes we had were prepared very well, and easy on sauce and salt so more \"clean\" tasting.  The only real lowlight was a sweet and sour pork dish that I was told could be excellent if made well, but theirs was disappointing.  But among the many highlights included the sweet-tasting melon soup, wonderfully fried and fresh lobster, tender and flavorful pea sprouts, sublimely succulent beef, fresh steamed green bass (better on first visit than second), meltingly soft eggplant casserole with snappy shrimp, and the show-stopping stuffed chicken cut table side.  Thin, perfectly crispy skin encasing a lustrous and excellent glutinous rice (which I'm seldom a fan of).  Very competently made Cantonese food, worth going back for.  Highly recommend dinner reservations and definitely recommend checking out what dishes require pre-ordering and considering getting some of those.  Lots of regulars here, and that's always a good sign."}
{"text":"The preserved pork is the best in town.The food quality and the service is great. Ppl there are loud but friendly. Overall I will give it a 5 start. There is one server name Mandy and she is gorgeous !!! :)."}
{"text":"Pros: - Maple Yip was the best Cantonese restaurant we frequented during our Toronto trip that we went twice in a row. The stellar quality of the food matched the level of Hong Kong's cuisine.  - Make sure to call and make a reservation, as it's very popular among locals. - Highly recommend the Lobster with Ginger and Scallions over Noodles, Sticky Rice Chicken (an entire chicken baked to crispy skin perfection, stuffed with succulent sticky rice- you have to call the morning of to order), Green Beans with Minced Pork, and Pork Belly Slices over Picked Vegetables.  -  Very clean bathrooms  - Takes credit cards  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I have always passed by this restaurant over the years and just end up at the Kenny Noodle next door just because it looked pretty packed and expensive.  This time I went there for a food run with a few Yelpers and it was still pretty packed and expensive.  The food we ordered were excellent though, save for the rice dish.  Pork belly and Steamed fish was still standard fare, I eat this dish regularly so it wasn't anything special, but they weren't bad.  Some of the more interesting fare was the wintermelon top thingy.  Wintermelon  + anything is usually refreshing on the colder days.  This was no exception.  The soup was a vegetarian dish, but it was still awesome enough for a meatatarian like me.  The crab and egg dish was pretty unique in presentation, the taste was also good.  Alarmingly good in fact.  I haven't eaten these ingredients in this configuration so ++ points for it.  Although steamed oyster is a standard fare for me, this run let me try two different ways of eating it: garlic and black bean.  Garlic still wins hands down.  The black bean one was a bit tart for my taste.  The other thing that's unique for me was the stuffed duck.  Not much really to say here, it's just good.  At this point my taste buds were already too overwhelmed I can't remember things anymore.  The most interesting one was the chicken / fish mousse.  It's a dish where there's a layer of chicken over a layer of fish paste to make it look like a mousse.  I haven't eaten anything like it before and I regretted not eating more of it.  The combination was excellent.  I'll definitely come here again, probably with some rich relatives and have to make sure I do a reservation.:D"}
