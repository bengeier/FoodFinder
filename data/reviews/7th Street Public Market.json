{"text":"Great little hidden gem! I'm a big foodie and I thought the local dip sandwich was very good!"}
{"text":"For any New Yorkers in Charlotte, the Public Market is like Chelsea Market, only way more manageable. There are a few vendors selling high quality groceries, soap, etc., and another few selling food to eat there at the market. Great place to take visitors from out of town when you're passing through Uptown."}
{"text":"Last night we went to 7th Street Market and while sitting in the same space were able to have craft beers, crepes, sushi and a cup of coffee on the way out. We couldn't decide what we wanted because everything looked good so we were able to grab a few things from multiple places and share. It was the perfect spot to grab dinner and drinks before going to a concert."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Just another unique trait to Charlotte's awesome environment. I had a grilled cheese with prosciutto, smoked mozz, and roasted tomatoes and a cola from dillworth that was to die for ! And it's inside! Great for a chilly day"}
{"text":"I adore this market. We get fresh farm eggs from here all.the.time. The pizza bar is really yummy. And the coffee? A little expensive but AH-mazing! Totally worth the money. We love jumping on the lightrail to come visit the market. It's also fun to look at all the fish in the back - my kid LOVES the lobsters. It's also cool to see local vendors all in one place here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a must stop place when visiting Uptown.   There are a variety of restaurants to choose from and you really can't go wrong. I grabbed a beautiful cup of coffee at \"Not Just Coffee\" to start my day. Then had a gluten free crust Slap Yo Mama Lasagna pizza from Pure Pizza. The gf crust was surprisingly good and the toppings were all fresh.  Make sure to spent some time looking through the variety of shops they have there. Adorable \"Charlotte\" themed merchandise is available."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and this place instantly became my go to place for very good, easy, reasonably priced food. I loved the coffee place and had a great salad from the pizza place and local loaf makes a mean breakfast and awesome macaroon. I'd have eaten more meals there if I could have."}
{"text":"Took my daughter, who's home for spring break, to try the Not Just Coffee. Wound up trying a lot more and we really enjoyed our first visit to 7 St Mkt. We picked up some tea, a few vegetables(got a huge red pepper for a buck!), and some meat from the impressive meat and seafood place - the guys are pros and everyone at the mkt seems to take pride. We brought home a little apple pie from the bakery - delicious! Not too sweet like most, great crust. Pizza also looked delicious. We were extra happy to find Josh, who we knew at Pasta and Provisions, selling wine from his \"Sorting Table\" filled with stacks and stacks of wines he knows inside and out. Brought home 6 bottles to go with the meat and more - tried the Chardonnay last night. Reasonable price and excellent! Plus Josh is always fun to do business with. The coffee was artfully prepared and delicious, though lacking the chit-chat factor of the wine and meat areas. Overall, 7th St has great people, products and vibe and yes it was a little quiet (Tues. afternoon) and a few booths were closed, but  I imagine it  will get  more hustle in its bustle soon. Go see Josh and his talented neighbors soon! Cheers.  PS: loved the free parking in 7 th station/building with blue and green lights - we zapped our parking ticket at the machine near market door, next to flower booth."}
{"text":"I'm sure it would have been a 5 star in my reviews hiwever, I so wish Yelp and 7th Street Market, updated their information. They're closed this week 17th July for renovations. I didn't get to experience all the delights. I will be back though."}
{"text":"I think this market has a little something for everyone, which is great. Definitely take advantage of the parking validation if you are there for 90 minutes or less. If you are planning to stay longer here, or just uptown in general, pick any garage but this. My friend and I were there for a little over 3 hours and were charged $33. Total rip-off being that there are literally MULTIPLE better options around that don't charge nearly as much, especially during the weekend."}
{"text":"A food court minus the mall! This places always busy There are so many options from breads, pastries, acai bowls, pizza, coffee, crepes, etc. There's even a tiny market in the back with things like local honey, vegetables, meat and even handmade jewelry. It's a hodgepodge of shopping and food. That being said, I enjoy the Not Just Coffee bar a lot, but it can be very expensive here for average food you would expect in a fast-paced setting. Definitely worth a look, though!"}
{"text":"Loving this place. There are more and more little shops being added. The coffee shop and other places are open early. Which is fabulous for a quick morning sandwich and drink!"}
{"text":"Awesome showcase of local food establishments. I loved the section of market that sells local meats and cheese."}
{"text":"This place has so many good things going for it! Besides being a great space, there was a multitude of food options and things to check out. There truly is something for everyone here.   Within the area there was a coffee shop, a crepe stand, a pizzeria, a bar, a cheese shop, a chocolate shop, a bakery, and I'm sure more that I'm forgetting. There were also areas selling local soaps, jewelry and other products.   I wound up there at brunch time on Saturday, and although very busy, I found seating for two outside at an umbrella table by the train. I got the Maple Dream crepe from the creperie, and it was delicious! It was filled with egg, cheese, bacon, and topped with powdered sugar and maple syrup. I was still hungry after eating just one though so you might need to get something else in addition.   Although pretty packed, the food was ready quickly. They gave the buzzers to let you know when it was done. Plus the wait didn't even feel long because you have so many things to peruse as you wait!  Final thoughts - both if you're just visiting Charlotte or are a local, the 7th Street Public Market should be at the top of your list to visit!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews before we went so made sure it was after 11am on Saturdays. Fantastic vendors, crepes, sushi, local loaf, coffee, craft beer, pizza...all consumable on premise. Small market so don't think this is San Francisco but plenty of delicious goodies to pick from. The parking garage that the market is in validates. The machine is next to the sushi. God, don't forget barchacolate ghost chili salted Carmel chocolates. To die for. We will frequent as often as we can because of the atmosphere,  long tables encourage chatting and the patrons are all very quick to share their favorite dishes. It's almost more of a destination place than a \"gosh, I need to get some cheese\", kinda place. If possible, have some latte and linger."}
{"text":"Three stars for its current form.  As the place fills out, I might be willing to give more.  Overall this is the hub of local, sustainable, fair trade, etc.  There are several vendors: produce, meat and seafood, honey and beeswax products, coffee shop, cake shop, pizza place and a few other small niche-y spots.  There are several \"wanted\" signs posted so if you do a small, local thing and are looking for a space you might want to consider giving the proprietors a call.  I'd love to see this as a full-out local bazaar style shop. With that said, if you know local/sustainable you know penny pinching is not necessarily a feasible thing.  There are really good, high quality products here and in this case I'll say you pay for what you get.  It ain't cheap. I foresee this place doing fairly well if it can get more vendors, the 7th street location is smart for those quick pick-ups for the before and after work commuter crowd."}
{"text":"This market is okay but there's nothing special about it. There are a few restaurants and a cluster of shops resembling a grocery store. The food shops are available at other locations so there's not much that's unique to this location. Overall though, it's a good place to chill."}
{"text":"Love all the fresh fruit and granola. They were very accommodating to change the fruits I wanted.  It was delicious. Highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I have watched 7th Street Market over the past year, slowly growing, and I can't be more excited about it. I have yet to have a bad experience, and I have probably been there 20+ times since they opened.  The Market has become my go-to place anytime I am in uptown, and they keep adding more and more fantastic vendors, it is like opening a new gift at every visit! There are two many wonderful vendors in the Market to choose a favorite, and I hope to review each one of them separately soon, but here is a run-down of what is there now:  - Not Just Coffee - truly the best coffee in Charlotte. Pour overs are wonderful, but the cortado is my absolute favorite. They also make all their own syrups, and the hot chocolate is amazing!  - Fran's Filling Station - an outpost of the Park Rd, restaurant, they offer a more condensed menu, but you will still find the delicious tater tots. Great salads!  - Pure Pizza - Best. Pizza. Ever. I am in love with the sprouted whole wheat crust. It is rare to find a restaurant that makes a decent whole wheat crust that is 100% whole wheat. Pure Pizza figured it out, and offers some of the best gourmet pizzas I have ever had. The plain cheese is rockin', too, and the 10in. is a very reasonable $5.95 in the afternoon. The local honey provided to dip your crust in is a lovely added touch. Another great spot for salads.  - Bonzai Fusion sushi - have only tried the sushi once, and while it is a little pricey (unless you order the daily specials), it was very good. The menu is not too short, nor too long, and offers both standard sushi fare, and some original rolls.   - Nelly's Naturals - my go to vendor for locally made organic goodies.  The farmers market section in the back includes local produce, diary, meat, and seafood. Always fresh, and locally sourced.  Other vendors include Salud Beer, Charlotte Tea & Spice Co, Bond Street Wines, Viva Raw, and Eden Flowers."}
{"text":"Cool place and really cool local shops.  I love coming here to get gifts for christmas/birthdays/etc."}
{"text":"Really interesting place with tons of different options. Coffee,beer, creeps, bread and cheese. I wish I hadn't eaten before heading here just wanted to browse because VIVA RAW had space here. We had just had one of there juices over at VTGCLT pop popup market at the good year building .we didn't end up getting anything to eat or bring home as we weren't  heading home right away. Next time we will be picking up something tasty while we are there."}
{"text":"7th Street is like a little foodie tour of Charlotte. We walked this time but you can get validated parking. Tried the Hazelnut Crepery & enjoyed the breakfast Santorini--it was a little light but tasty. I also went to Ormann cheese shop & the lovely person there helped me find a cheese for today's dinner. I ended up with a sheep's cheese that I had never heard of but it was smooth."}
{"text":"Best place to have a laid back vibe and really good food. Love Local Loaf and Assorted Table! Also, if you want cool CLT products there is a cute shop CLT Find for different souvenir or local products. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Was in the area for a flea market that was so disappointing and searched for things to do around. I love it! It has a bunch of eateries, there's a bakery in there that had some good looking pound cake loaves. There is a lady who lets you paint silk scarves, looked like fun! But the best thing about it was hazelnuts creperie! I had the Thai savory crepe and ooooh it was delicious!!! Chicken, lettuce, mixed nuts, peanut dressing! Yum yum! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit!  I think that it is a great use of space and I feel as though it is a great stride to growing the unique side of Charlotte.  The variety of local dining places inside is very robust, while showcasing a very collaborative feel.  My only complaint is with validation for parking and their current system. I was there for under 90 minutes and validated my ticket. I even went as far as asking my friend to ensure that I was doingdid it right and low and behold when I left, I still had to pay $8. I have heard of this from several people. It was disheartening for me since that was one of the reasons we chose there as a meeting place."}
{"text":"I feel like every city I visit has something like this although some aren't nearly as well put together or accessible as 7th St Market. It's not too big but has a lot of vendors. There's locally-sourced produce and meat on one side. A cheesemonger, a killer coffee/tea place, draught beers, breakfast, crepes, pastries, sushi, everything you could possibly need to enjoy a lazy weekend afternoon.   We got some great cold-pressed juice and then put together a custom 6-pack of local microbrews for cheap. The wine selection was pretty impressive and we definitely would have come back to peruse the wine if we weren't in town so briefly."}
{"text":"I went to the 7th St public market today with a friend for lunch. It was our first time eating here and certainly won't be the last. We enjoyed our crepes, and as good as they were, I had onions on mine even when I asked them to leave them off. I forgive. After that I ordered some chicken tenders from local loaf to take home. This is a fun place to go for a meal, or even a nitro brewed coffee. Literally 10 feet from the light rail."}
{"text":"Love love this place.   On. A recent visit to Charlotte we were told we needed to check it out so we did.  We were not sorry.  Mostly food with a wine shop and a small gift shop with local items.  We tried the coffee shop and we ate some food from several little shops.  It is loud. There are many people and children in the space so be prepared.  You will love it but know that it is a busy place."}
{"text":"Most convenient hideaway for me. Serves as my office, bakery, coffee shop, pizzeria, sandwhich spot, sushi spot, deli, bar, meeting space and general hang out. Did I mention they validate parking? It's perfect and it's in a great location in Uptown. Convenient to so many things."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday morning, about an hour after they officially opened. That unfortunately doesn't mean that all the vendors will be there - half the stalls were deserted or locked up.   We got some coffee from two very serious, untalkative baristas. The coffee was good. But we did not feel inclined to linger.   On to the craft beer stall - decent selection,  but everything seemed to be more expensive than at places like the Good Bottle Company, where you have an even bigger selection and can also make mixed packs.   The raw food vendor was really nice, he offered samples, but we did not buy anything. Things were a little on the pricy side - not saying good fresh ingredients aren't worth it, but you have to have the budget for it. We went to the Healthy Home Market on South Blvd. afterwards and got excellent juices and smoothies for less money.  We passed by a cheese vendor, and after the initial excitement realized that the cheapest cheese offered was over 20 dollars/lb. On we traipsed, empty-handed. (To Trader Joe's, where we stocked up on amazingly yummy cheeses from all over the world for 6 to 11 dollars/lb.)  Bottom line: Everything you get here looks to be great quality, premium foods and drinks (minus the very wilted fruits and vegetables at the produce stall, of which hardly any where in season in the first place). But for everything offered there I can think of a different place in Charlotte where I can get something equally good for much less money. Combine that with the half-hearted, moderately friendly interactions with the vendors there, and I'm fairly sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's just get a few things out of the way. First, Ferry Building or Pike's Public Market this is not, just like Charlotte does not equal San Francisco or Seattle. So get it out of your head that it will be on that level. I wish that we could combine all the farmers markets in the city and put them all together, but at this point they're so fragmented and self sustaining, I doubt they will shut down, even for slightly subsidized rent from the City.   So given that things will grow organically over time, I think this is a great start. I can't wait to watch it grow.   Some best-in-class creative operators like Not Just Coffee, Bar Chocolate, Pure Pizza and Meat & Fish Market as well as a cheese counter that serves gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches make this place a winner. I was surprised by how many people were just hanging out in the middle of the day eating and drinking (even champagne!) on their laptops. Definitely La Dolce Vita and a great haven for foodies!  The service I received from all of the vendors was excellent, especially the Meat/Fish Market who had lobsters larger than you've ever seen in the Queen City.  I will definitely continue to buy seafood from them in the future - the Norwegian salmon was amazing.  It gets a little extra credit for being on the rail line and offering free parking to patrons. It gets some docked because I wish there was more produce, but I guess if the volume isn't there, they have to select things that will last."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this market a 3.5...Yelp doesn't allow half-scores. They are clearly commitment folks. ?  My thoughts about the 7t St. Public Market are mixed. I remember the initial public meetings at its inception. The market was presented as a solution to the food insecurity issues in Charlotte. At that time, it was championed as a place that would provide local, fresh, healthy food for populations with limited transportation and income. Much of which was contingent upon the light rail system which was also new at that time.   Since that time, the market has transitioned into an incubator of sorts for new food businesses. I believe this was a part of the original idea, yet not to its current scale. Nonetheless, the concept is thriving and providing a great space for new businesses to test out their ideas and grow their businesses. While on a recent tour, the market director mentioned that 5 of the businesses that started in the space have grown to multiple locations in the Charlotte area.   The market now serves as a destination of sorts for visitors and tourists. Additionally, the space is hopping during the lunch hour, as it is convenient to many Uptown offices and the beautiful First Ward Park. They provide a variety of offerings from pour over coffee @ Not Just Coffee to gourmet popcorn from It's Poppin! Kettle Korn.   While I still feel that the need for fresh, local, affordable food needs to be addressed in that area, I can appreciate the concept of the 7th St Public Market. I believe similar concepts are needed in the Charlotte area for food businesses that are in earlier stages of development. Per the manager, getting a space in the market as a new business is competitive."}
{"text":"We visited the market this afternoon after visiting the Levine Museum of the New South - and although the market isn't real large, it's appealing and also attractive.  There are good food options, a coffee place and a wine store.  Also, there's plenty of seating and it's a bright & airy environment."}
{"text":"Well I admit it, I was so excited to finally be in the 7th St Market! And I'm a little ashamed that its taken me so long to get here!   Let's go over the highlights:  Fresh meats and seafood, produce, pizza, chocolate, sushi and a coffee joint that I hear is simply amazing! Who could ask for more?!?  Just walking around to each different station and talking with the staff and how pleasant and knowledgeable everyone was certainly a treat!   And they validate parking for the first 90 minutes!!!   It's definitely a great local find and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I love 7th street market and would seriously hang out here all the time if I lived closer. There are vendors for whatever you could need and some delicious Charlotte food spots to choose from, whether you're in the mood for breakfast, pizza, crepes, salads, Italian, sandwiches or smoothies. This is one of our favorite spots to take visitors!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte, but I took one star away because of how pricy it can be. I understand why it's so pricy, because everything is of serious quality. There are some more budget friendly things there, though.   I have purchased from quite a few vendors. Teas, produce, wine, coffee...soon I hope to afford some of the fantastic meats and cheeses! Today I got lavender earl grey tea, chamomile tea, real beef jerky, rose lemonade, some dog bones for my Shepherd, bottle of wine, and some produce.   We also went and had lunch. We ate from the sandwich shop at the very end, across from the sushi place (I forgot the name). While it was good, for $20 I was kind of hoping for a larger portion. However, it was damn tasty and I would get the ham and brie again in a heartbeat! No mango chutney though, that just tasted like straight sugar.   I have had a pizza from the pizza place and it's one of the best I've had in my life, and I've lived in quite a few cities \"known for their pizza\".   It's convenient because the train stops right in front of it, and for people like me, who hate driving in the city and driving in general, that's perfect. You can easily walk to the Discovery Place and surrounding places.   Love it."}
{"text":"I eagerly awaited heading to the market to see what I could taste. Unfortunately Bonzai Fusion Sushi was closed but there was still options so I decided to go to Zia Pia Imports. I ordered the special a pesto pasta and the flavor was very bland. Disappointing experience !"}
{"text":"I kind of love this place. But to be honest, I do have a soft spot for places like this that is open market style with several different food options. It's certainly not huge, there's a pizza place, a burger/sandwich place, a creperie, a sushi place, an acai bowl stand, a coffee shop and a taproom. There's also some room for desserts and other grocery type places which I haven't bought from but look gourmet style. I've eaten sushi here which was pretty good. It came out fresh and with good flavor. I've also had one of their vegetarian crepes which was really good. Can't remember the name but it had black beans avocado and cheese. I tried a blueberry muffin from the sandwich shop which was too dry and hard but I guess they can't all be winners. Other bonus is that you get two hours free parking at 7th street Laz parking garage."}
{"text":"This is my favorite kind of place. Think of San Francisco's Ferry Building or Washington, D.C.'s Union Market. Make it smaller and drop it in Charlotte. Bam, 7th Street Market.   Full of local vendors and classic Charlotte color. Great food surrounds you. Free parking up to 90 minutes in the attached garage (don't forget to validate!). Grab a cup of coffee and try to snag a table (or share with others and make new friends!), and leave room for dessert because between crepes and baked goods and ice cream, you're going to want it."}
{"text":"Such a good selection of food to choose from from multiple venues when you go inside! Plenty of seating which was first come first serve seating and the whole area had Wi-Fi, you just had to hunt down the password which was posted on several venue walls by the cash registers. The atmosphere felt like a market + cafe + food court, it was very unique and I definitely would come back."}
{"text":"We are incredibly lucky to have another local marketplace! We attended last Saturday, which was the final day of their week-long grand opening celebration.  You walk in & local vendors welcome you with open arms!  Their \"stalls\" are set up nicely & organized. You have a mini deli - with fresh meat & fish, a produce section with local veggies, a wine area, Pure Pizza, Not Just Coffee, Viva Raw Juice Bar, a cheesecake stand, a ice cream/cake vendor, & a stand with \"real deal\" New Orleans muffuletta sandwiches & pralines. More vendors are on their way soon. The market is so bright & inviting.  I'm extremely happy the market is here...it's in such a good location.  It's the last stop on the light rail & if you park in the 7th Street parking deck, get your parking pass validated at the Farm Vendor stand inside the market - it's good for 90 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer to the 7th Street Market and love the ebb and flow of this space. It's open, has a high ceiling and retains the feel like that of an open market in San Francisco or New York. Spaces are continually being filled with great local growers, wine sellers, sweet treats and many others.   My favorites:   Not Just Coffee Tasty Yo The Meat and Fish Market Pure Pizza  For those of you hesitant about parking, fear not. Parking is validated for up to 90 minutes at 7th Street Station parking garage! Bring your pass into the market and their is a validation machine near the main entrance. Simple and definitely makes shopping here a more palatable experience. Speaking of entrances, make sure you don't exit out of one of the emergency exits! Just be sure to check which door you choose when leaving. The emergency exits sound a horridly loud alarm. It happens all the time! Though entertaining, and somewhat humorous, just make sure you actually read the signs on the door(s).  Wifi can be a bit of a problem. I'm not always sure of the situation, but ask one of the biz owners and they may be able to help if you can't connect. Plenty of plugs on the floor for laptops/phones, however.   I'm excited to see how this place develops. Can't wait to see which vendors make it in throughout the rest of this year!"}
{"text":"I've been to the market only a handful of times, seemingly on random Sunday afternoons.  Each time I've been a bit disappointed because the vendors have been closed and I just simply did not feel the great vibe this place has a reputation for.  Today, however, I was reassured that it is indeed a great market.  I'd compare it to Chelsea Market, but on a smaller scale.  I enjoyed a caramel latte from Not Just Coffee and a bee pollen praline from Bar Chocolate - both worthy of the trip alone.  My great disappointment was that I had eaten lunch before I arrived and missed out sampling from some great menus.  I'll definitely be back for lunch or brunch at Local Loaf, a post-workout juice from Viva Raw, sushi at Bonsai, pizza from Pure, and a vegan cupcake from Novel Sweets.  The outdoor seating will be perfect when the cooler fall weather arrives."}
{"text":"Stopped through here to check out Not Just Coffee, but was pleasantly surprised by this nice indoor market. I wish there were more food shops, but the place is great as it already is.  You'll need to park in the parking garage or come by the light rail, which has a station outside of the building.  I don't see people spending more than an hour here since it's mostly food specialty shops and a few restaurant counters. I hope it grows if I return someday."}
{"text":"Grab a bottle of wine or a couple of craft beers and order a pizza from Pure and you have a perfect lunch date! Quintessentially Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I had a great time checking out the public market. The stalls were neat and the workers I spoke to were very nice. I loved the pizza we had for lunch from Pure Pizza. A big plus it was walkable from my hotel."}
{"text":"Pretentious, fake beatnik, Brooklyn-hipster wannabes.  Not kid friendly, or friendly at all. Also over-priced. Cool and nice are not diametrically opposed.  Two stars for the two nice people working there."}
{"text":"A must-visit right in the heart of the city! If you are hungry and do not know what to eat, this is the place to go! There are many different options from drinks to desserts, and all are unique and delicious. The vibes are quirky and just a good place to be. It also doubles as a Farmers Market, which is awesome because you can buy more food from cheeses to wines! There is so much to do and see in Charlotte and this place is one of them."}
{"text":"Very cool place! A variety of locally sourced food can be found here. We came here on a Saturday morning and parking was a breeze - the parking deck provides ample parking. But take note - DO NOT LOSE your parking ticket  - hard lesson for me, as I lost it and had to pay the $16 lost ticket fee. OUCH.  For folks who hold onto their tickets - there is validated parking for up to 90 minutes.  There is a nice mix of vendors - all of them are friendly, knowledgeable, and very passionate about their products! You have everything from pizza to sushi, to cupcakes to chocolates, to gourmet cheeses to interesting salts! We were impressed all the vendors - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great concept in an excellent location (near the Lynx railways)  Nice variety of stores and they validate parking for the 1st 90 minutes.  I didn't sample the cuisine but will do so on my next go round.  Will I revisit??? YEP!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were debating Local Loaf or Hazelnuts Creperie for breakfast, I chose Local Loaf so when we arrived I saw that they were BOTH here, FTW (I went based off of the address, I did not know these were in the market)! The best of both worlds. I personally have never been in a market like this before so the experience was awesome.   Why is this place so awesome?!  Grab a coffee or tea at Not Just Coffee Grab a beer at Tank's Tap, experience several breweries in Charlotte at one stop, or get a glass and/or bottle of wine at Assorted Table Wine Shoppe Delicious food options Grab farm fresh ingredients from Greeneman Farms  I wish I knew about the free parking maybe I should have read the reviews before.. whoops. Such a cute little market!"}
{"text":"I am only in town a few weeks for work and this place was a must see! I had a caramel latte at not just coffee and bought some local apple butter, they did not disappoint. I loved the vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love exploring markets, especially when I'm visiting a new city. It's a great way to have several different experiences all in one place. Most of the time those experiences involve small local businesses, which are my favorite, duh! During my long weekend trip to Charlotte I actually visited 7th Street Public Market twice. Yep, you heard me! I loved it so much on Saturday afternoon that I went back on Monday morning before heading out of town.  I made several loops around the market before making some decisions on what to get. On both of my trips I started off  Not Just Coffee where I got an ice coffee and an oatmilk latte. I didn't even know oatmilk existed and being a person that has to opt for the milk alternative, my mind was blown! It was so smooth and creamy and there was no weird taste or texture. #winning I also really enjoy hazelnut creperie where I got a delicious crepe for lunch on my first visit. They had sweet and savory and event a little vegetarian section of the menu. Seriously something for everyone! Local Loaf was also a good find. I nibbled on my sister's blueberry waffles and they was pretty good. After filling my belly I browsed for a Charlotte souvenir and found myself at CLT Find. It was also an awesome spot for local knick-knacks and gift items. I scored some fantastic chap stick and a fun taco magnet.   Other vendors included a gourmet grilled cheese spot. It had gluten free bread, which was a major hit for my friend. There was also a juice joint, a spot that made fresh smoothie bowls, a popcorn stand, Tank's Tap, which had beer, a pizza spot, and so much more. You could also buy all kinds of goods like pasta and wine.   If I ever find myself back in Charlotte you bet I'll be stopping by. The parking garage is connected to the building and you can validate your ticket inside. They also had outdoor seating and a work area. Definitely come through, you will be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"The old Reid's is now 7th street station that houses several small vendors serving desserts, sandwiches, a small farmers market, pizza, etc.  I've yet to try all the vendors but definitely looking forward to doing so.  The cheesecake booth has been my sweet tooth fix lately but I have my eye on the pizza spot on my next trip over.  This is a great addition to uptown especially this time of the year when you can just walk over for lunch get a meal and dessert, grab a table outside or in and head back to work..........sweet!"}
{"text":"Different choices for different people! There are so many choices from pizza, crepes, bakery, sushi, sandwiches, wine, beer, a new Italian deli and the best coffee in Charlotte!   Great place for brunch and you can take the light rail straight into it! The seating use to be tight but they opened up more space and tables!   Our favorite stops are Hazelnut Crepe, Not Just Coffee and Local Loaf.   Here is what we usually order, in order of our favorites:  Not Just Coffee 1. Caramel Latte 2. Vanilla Sugar Latte  Hazelnut Crepe 1. Basil Pesto Chicken - Excellent Flavors that melt together perfectly!  2. Catalina  3. Chipotle Chicken  4. Undo Your Thai - this was our least favorite because the romaine threw it off. The romaine pulled the Crepe apart too easily. It was also spicy!   Local Loaf 1. The Chicken & the Egg - The Chipotle Cheer-wine Sauce made the sandwich our favorite because of it's unique flavor!   2. Croque Madame - Great hangover sandwich! It is definitely on the hearty side.  3. Cuban - The cuban isn't your typical cuban.   Tip: There is free parking but only enough time for you to enjoy your meal. If it's longer than that, you'll have to pay full price!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The creperie was amazing. Seriously.   The cheese shop looked so yummy and was friendly.   The Local was frustrating because we waited in line 20 min then they said the kitchen was closed (on an Sunday morning at 10 am.  ?)   I great place to wander for a bit and grab some yummy food.   Not so much tons of shopping. One store had goods, but they were super pricey."}
{"text":"This venue is similar to Reading Public Market in Philadelphia or Revival Food Hall in Chicago. The variety of food available guarantees that everyone will find something satisfying and the prices are not outrageous. I had a poke bowl from Bonsai Fusion last week and was a happy camper.  They have everything from breakfast to dessert, including alcoholic beverages, and a few cute little gift shoppy kiosks to find something to send back home. You may struggle to find seating but otherwise this is an ideal lunch stop."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of these trendy food courts. It's not as large as the pictures appear, but still a cool spot to visit if you're hanging out in Charlotte. I enjoyed a masala chai from the coffee shop, and a delicious pasta of the day from the Italian restaurant in the back. Overall, it's a good place to go if you're with other people and everyone wants something different to eat! The only thing that would make it better are a few other specialty boutiques/stands for people to shop and visit if they don't want to eat."}
{"text":"As a tourist, I opted to check this place out. If nothing else, I figured I'd kill time before I boarded the light rail train.   I went in searching for local beer for a friend. I went to the wine/beer booth near the back and spoke with a helpful, funny, cool dude (as well as texting back and forth with my friend) comparing and contrasting Charlotte to Portland in terms of beer, beer shopping and public transit.   I grabbed a six pack of local stuff and was offered shipping through UPS (but declined and packed it in my checked luggage).   Great experience, cute little market. Card was accepted no problem. Parking is a little tricksy but it's just outside a train stop.    I was staying at an Airbnb in Fourth Ward and this was an easy stroll on a sunny, crisp fall day."}
{"text":"I wasn't really wowed by this place. I was really excited to check it out and dragged my boyfriend here on an early Saturday morning. There really isn't much to this place. There were like 7 shops and some produce. The meat counter and produce were the equivalent of the grocery store. There may have been some local stuff but it was hidden amongst the regular stuff. The cheese shop was the light and hidden gem of the market!! The food locations that we tried (bakery, coffee) weren't great. It was too early for sushi or pizza so can't attest to those. They had a new Italian import shop that opened that day but we couldn't really see much going on there. Overall not impressed with the place and probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"What a great use of space in an ideal location! Get here however you can...easy Lynx stop at, you guessed it, 7th Street Station. Convenient parking garage...just get on the elevator and ride down to the tasty vendors on the ground floor. Like Benjamin said, bring your parking ticket with you so you can validate it.  This place has everything and is sure to please anyone in your party. There is a Bonsai Fusion (sushi bar), Pure Pizza, Fran's Filling Station, Tasty Yo, Not just coffee, wine, farmer's market, cakes, a raw juice bar...it's foodie fresh heaven! While there are a lot of vendors, it does not have the cafeteria or mall food court style feel (which is a good thing). Rather, it preserves the market feel and offers a more community gathering experience.   There are table and chairs set up inside and on the front patio. However, get a lot of people in here and seating can be quite limited.   I was very impressed with the layout and concept of the place. It's great to see collaboration of all these great places in one area.   If you are Uptown, I highly recommend dining here for a light, casual experience."}
{"text":"Lots of different shops that are always changing! Every time I visit there is always something new to see, sample, or explore. The environment is an open concept and a great place to socialize."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. My favorite past time is waking up hungover on the weekend and walking into this lovely place for some food.  Whether it be the cheap sushi, the wonderful sandwiches from local loaf, or some pizza I can't get enough.  Once I am done throwing this delicious food down my gullet then there is even more to be had.  There is a great coffee place inside and Tank's Tap if you want to beat the hangover the old fashioned way via beer.  There are some girly booths but dammit I am a man.  So i head to the butcher in the back and gets all the meats.    7th street you are beautiful and i would have babies with you if science figures out how"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Walked in to get breakfast and were pleasantly surprised by all of the other vendors. They have about 5 places you can eat at here and one vendor up front that sells handmade soap and jewelry. There is also a cheese shop and a place for wine in the back. I can see where it would become crowded easily on the weekend but we went on a Friday morning with no issues. Food from every vendor/restaurant looked great. They have outdoor seating too because indoor seating is limited"}
{"text":"Perhaps coming on a Thursday doesn't put off the big wow factor that others seem to feel about it judging by the Yelp reviews.  It was fine.  It was hot.  It was basically empty.   I easily found parking.  Easily found my way to the place by pressing the 1* button in the elevator.  I had already eaten lunch and was just wanting to get a cupcake and look around.  The cupcake was bleh at Cloud 9 and there were very few items at barChocolate.  I had some luck at Greeneman Farms and found some no sugar added apple butter and peach preserves for my dad.  Someone had sucked all of the air out of the room (it was so warm in there), so I bounced after that.  I should have gotten my parking validated, but I didn't, so parking was $4 for the short amount of time that I was there.    I may venture back to try Not Just Coffee or Pure Pizza, but not until cooler weather returns."}
{"text":"Visited the market on Saturday evening with a friend who is a local. The cheese counter was fantastic, and though she didn't have what I was searching for, she made two very successful recommendations! She then directed us to the sommelier at the wine booth, who sold us a very tasty, reasonably priced white.  The chocolates were gorgeous, coffee was fresh, and people working were all very helpful and generous. Even with three kids in tow, we enjoyed the experience of the market!"}
{"text":"Oh, man! I can't wait to see what the future holds for this place. I just returned from my first trip to Philly where I fell in love with Reading Terminal Market. In describing RTM to my mom, I called it 7th Street Market on steroids. But any further comparisons wouldn't be fair. 7th Street Market has only been open for a few months, not since 1892; and it serves a much smaller city. However, I see what the planners are going for and I couldn't be more excited.  I know many lamented the closing of the Reid's Fine Foods at this location but I think uptown Charlotte needs this place far more than what amounted to little more than an expensive grocery store for people with more money than sense...er, I mean...time to cook. There's plenty of that in the city's affluent neighborhoods already. And if you find yourself uptown and really must part with $10 for a small tub of pasta salad or whatever, there's always Dean & Deluca! This sort of place is exactly what Charlotte needs (along with more extensive public transportation and urban parks) if it's ever going to live up to its \"world class city\" ambitions.  So far I've only stopped in briefly for a quick cappuccino from Not Just Coffee and a cinnamon roll from Cloud 9 Confections before catching the train. I must say that not only was the cappuccino excellent, but there's a lot to be said for getting it served in a mug rather than a cardboard cup for a change. Caribou and Starbucks should take note. When dining (or sipping) in, presentation matters.  Having not had a chance to do any grocery shopping yet I must reserve some judgement in that regard. I will say that from looking around, the prices seemed quite reasonable considering everything is local, organic, free-range and all those other trendy adjectives that almost always serve to raise the price of produce and meat. If the market and vendors ever decide to adopt hours of operation conducive to turning a profit, I can see myself doing quite a lot of shopping here.   I look forward to giving this place at least one more star as they grow and fill up. Improvements are needed but that's obviously to be expected for such a new market. At the moment, the only dining options are a sandwich/American place and an artisan pizza shop. If they can attract some culinary diversity and stay open a bit longer (maybe even for a few hours on Sunday) I might need to make that 5 stars."}
{"text":"The 7th Street Market.  As I walk in I see the purple or Lavendar Piano on the right as well as people getting off the elevator from the parking lot.  Go through another set of doors and I am greeted with smells of food, coffee and soap...  It's a mini public market. Like a Farmers Market and a Flea Market infused together. Also a hodge podge of eateries lined up next to one another. As well as other hidden treasures to be found as you look around.  Center area is where tables and chairs for patrons to sit and eat. There are also table and chairs all the way in the back of the public market and rest rooms too.  The entrance to the Lynx Blue Line Rail is right by Not Just Coffee- They make great coffee. From Cappuccinos, Expresso to Cortado and more. The staff can just about whip up anything for you. Had all three the last time I was here and I was up all night long with a smile on my face.  Hazelnuts Creperie is my go to place. The urges run wild and I must get the Basil Pesto Chicken Crepe. Chunks of chicken smothered in pesto with cheese just oozes out as I take my first bite into crispy crepe.  A numbered pager is given after you place your order and it vibrates when you food is ready. More time to explore and shop.  Greeneman Farm got some interesting items. Had my eye on the empanadas and quail eggs. Fresh vegetables are sold out relatively early. By afternoon, not much was left.  Will be back again to check out the other eateries and establishments. They have something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Through the years, 7th Street Market has grown so much. Not Just Coffee, Pure Pizza and a few others have been there through the years but others have come in and really made this place awesome.   Park in the attached garage and take your ticket in for validation (up to 90 minutes). Get a cup of coffee and a crepe from Hazelnuts or a beer from Tank's Tap and a pizza."}
{"text":"This market is amazing, I went here for some coffee and lunch with a friend and it was fantastic. They pay for the first 90 minutes you park in the garage but the parking is expensive! I was there for about three hours and had to pay 10 dollars even after having it validated. Still yet I considered it totally worth it. They have some amazing shops in there and the atmosphere is great, a very popular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great Crepes! Indoor, grab something to eat, sit down, and then shop kind place! Bring a cooler if you buy dairy products and have to travel. Foodie place."}
{"text":"This a great place to get breakfast or lunch in downtown Charlotte.  It appears to be an incubator with many small food related businesses sharing a large space.    There is a coffee shop, wine store, cheese store with meals available, too), grocery store, creperie, pizza stall, bakery, juice bar and 2 or 3 other food vendors.     There is something for every one, including vegetarians, vegans and people with food allergies."}
{"text":"Super fun and cute place. Lots of variety for dining. Options for folks on all sorts of diets/lifestyles. Reasonable prices and yummy local food. Coffee, wine, pizza, burgers, crepes, açaí bowls, you name it. You can park in the lot and validate your parking for free 90 minute parking. Seating is limited but we didn't have a problem securing a spot for 3. Cute local hangout."}
{"text":"Variety variety variety is always served at 7th Street Market. Pure Pizza is the best pizza around and their lunch special is amazing. I just wish I could wash it down with a cold Hop Drop and Roll from Tank's Tap but gotta go back to work"}
{"text":"I love the concept and location of this place.  I walked by this so many times on my way to class before realizing there was something awesome inside.  I do wish they would close a little later though.  So far I have only tried the cheese shop..everytime I go in I intend to try something else but end up going back.  Maybe next time I'll be able to pull myself away and try another counter."}
{"text":"Great space with local vendors featuring food, coffee, wine, cheese, chocolates, and gift items. There are usually pop up markets during the holidays and throughout the year. Also, they validate 90 minutes of parking if you make a purchase in the market!"}
{"text":"Imagine the Ferry Building Market Place in San Fransisco, now imagine if that were for ants. That's the size comparison of Charlotte's 7th Street Market to San Fran's Market. 7th Street Market isn't literally for ants, but it did initially remind me of the Ferry Building Market, just on a much, much smaller scale.  Conveniently located directly off one of the cities transit systems, it's a walk from downtowns bustling Tyron Street but not a bad enough location to keep people away. Visiting on a Friday morning, there were plenty of business looking professions meeting around the community sitting area and the mix of people in a \"study/work space.\" Convenient and free 90 minute parking is located directly next door although 90 minutes sure does go by fast when you're having fun! They've got a piano in the entrance, a shop with body products and a local farmers type market along with a small selection of restaurants (a bakery, creperie, Japanese joint, pizza parlor and grilled cheese shop) plus beer and coffee. It makes for a lovely spot for a casual work breakfast/lunch or study nook (free wifi!). I could see myself grabbing a beer after work here.  I don't think I would call this a must visit if you're touring the city, but for locals, this place is a treat. Small, clean, bright and great smelling food."}
{"text":"My Wife and I checked this place out Sunday!  \"Not Just Coffee\" the Coffee Shop was the ONLY Part Open for Business!  Not Just Coffee is the BEST part of this \"market\".  This Place has potential, to be a lookalota, though I think that is all!  This place is still a Disappointment, Not what we were expecting!  \"Not Just Coffee\", the Pizza Place (Pure Pizza) and the Bakery (Cloud Nine) are the only places we would be returning to see, maybe... \"Old World Olive Oil\" does have a small kioskiosk... Meat Market in the back has the HUGEst LIVE Lobsters I have seen in person (I'm the person, Lobsters are not people [PETA may disagree])...     The Outside (Rail Patio) is much more exciting than inside!  Much more exciting to watch the people on a beautiful weather day (100% this time)!  I'm NOT going to review the 10 Story Parking Garage (you can, others have) even though it is 5 stars GREAT... Maybe I should review it since they suck so much less (now with all the security cameras)... The Roof Top has incredible views and it is still Legal, be careful what you do up there, the cameras are W I D E Angle!  Plastic spikes to prevent suicide attempts??? They are so small how does that work?  The Parking Garage is so cool I think I will review it!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by uptown.  Lots of goodies to be found here!  The coffee bar is fantastic.  And the crepe station.....do yourself a favor and order the banana, peanut butter, nutella.  YUM.  I haven't tried the pizza place there yet, but have read lots of rave reviews.  This is right on the light rail, so hop on and take a ride through uptown too!"}
{"text":"Great location, and clean facilities. Great guy behind the counter, did not hit me to hard for wearing a Redskins outfit....."}
{"text":"Great place for a great bite! Good variety of shops: coffee, sushi, crepes, farmers market, sweets. I highly recommend the local loaf! We had a wonderful breakfast plate"}
{"text":"I've been to the 7th Street Public Market on numerous occasions and they get better with every visit. All employees are friendly and helpful and they have some amazing vendors inside. There is really something for everyone. Park in the adjacent parking garage and bring your ticket to get 90 minutes of free validated parking."}
{"text":"Wow loved this farmers market but much more like a vendors market. They need fresh produce. But anyways loved the Italian corner in the back- I bought one of everything lol. Also there were vendors for baked goods, cheese, coffee, fresh pizza...etc. I would recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, local goods and food. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back! This will certainly be a weekend stop and place we bring guests."}
{"text":"I love this market!  There's a little bit of a lot of the things I love!  I stumbled upon this market after a trip with the little one to ImaginOn and what a pleasant surprise.  The candle shop in front is awesome, the market of produce and specialty items is the back, amazing,  and the food in between ain't bad either.  My son loved the outdoor seating right by the rails and even had the pleasure of seeing a train go by.  As many little vendors as there are inside the atmosphere is surprisingly quiet, well not too noisy and you can always find a seat. Bonus: they validate parking for the attached garage.  That's tight folks 90 mins of free parking ;-). Can go wrong.  Have a look"}
{"text":"It is a small New York style deli with a difficult and overcrowded parking lot! It is a clean environment and the food is served quickly.  I enjoyed the turkey Ruben except it needed more sauerkraut."}
{"text":"My Order of Operations for 7th Street Public Market: 1.) Get a cup of smooth, delicious cappuccino from Not Just Coffee - don't add anything to it, just sip it slowly, sit at the bar, look around, and reflect. 2.) Say hi to Josh at the Sorting Table and buy a bottle (or two) of wine he recommends as a pairing for dinner that night. 3.) Get fresh cuts of grain fed animals for the carnivores in my life allll the way at the back of the market.  4.) Get 2 hazelnut covered trufflies at barCHOCOLATE and eat them immediately, with eyes closed and frown upside down. 5.) Validate parking ticket for car parked right next door.  I've lived in Charlotte almost exactly 1 year, and it has taken me this long to discover the good vibes of the 7th Street Public Market...don't waste that kind of time! Make your way over there and support our local food artists and purveyors!"}
{"text":"We went to a wine and paint party here. This place is so cute. They have a coffee shop, a bakery, a pizza place, a wine place and a few other things to enjoy. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really don't know how I went so long without knowing about this place. It is fantastic! Half market and half food stands, and all enclosed (although they do have some nice outdoor seating too).  It's a very kid-friendly place as well. The floors are sealed concrete and the tables and chairs are indestructible, so there's really nothing so delicate they can mess up. When we went mid-day on a Saturday, the place was full of families with strollers.  One half is food \"stalls\" which have everything you could think of, from paninis to sushi to crepes to soup to pizza. We went to the sandwich place and got awesome fresh made-to-order sandwiches with sides of house made pickles or hand cut chips. It was the perfect snack before heading into the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center.  On the other half of the floor is a market with jars of local canned goods and honeys and soaps and pretty much everything you'd want at a natural, local market, including wine! There are definitely items here that grabby little hands could break, so best to keep the little ones in the stroller in this section. (At least if they are as accident prone as I was as a child.)  Moral of the story: Go there. Eat things. Validate your parking. And get up from your table when you're done (don't be that guy.)"}
{"text":"Charlotte needs more public spaces, so I am happy to see the 7th Street Public Market putting down its roots. We paid a visit this past weekend, and while as others have noted, there is still a little bit of settling-in and construction to finish up, on the whole, it was a good experience.  The market is basically an indoors farmers market with booths and counters around the perimeter of common seating. There's a good assortment of goodies to be found, most of them related to established Charlotte businesses: Pure Pizza, Fran's (coming soon), Not Just Coffee, Las Delicias bakery, Bond Street Wines, etc. There's also a large butcher counter and fresh produce. I look forward to spending a Saturday afternoon here, eating pizza and leisurely shopping around, as soon as I can.  At this point, the only mark I can put into the negative column involves hours of operation: the market itself is open fairly late, but on Saturdays, a lot of the booths close at 3:00 or 4:00. This seems counter-intuitive to me (I'd certainly stop in for a cup of coffee before or after a show, for example), so I hope the vendors are committed to staying open long enough to generate sufficient business. I really want this space to succeed!  One final note: THEY VALIDATE PARKING. I put that in all caps because that fact makes me much more likely to visit often, and I suspect others will feel the same way."}
{"text":"Great spot for my wife and I, but surprised no one here has more GF options for my daughter."}
{"text":"There aren't enough tables.... ordered food and had no where to sit. Loud horrible band playing brass instruments"}
{"text":"So...I have been wanting to go to the 7th St. Market since they opened, and It was worth the wait! The atmosphere is very inviting and laid back. There's so much variety. They have Viva Raw which sells Raw juices, www.viva-raw.com, The Sorting Table which sells wine, www.thesortingtableon7th.com, Salts of the Earth which sells natural, gourmet and specialty salts from around the world. There is also a cheese shop called Orman's that has delicious cheese. The French Comte cheese is to LIVE for! Novel Sweets is there also, they sell gourmet vegan cupcakes, www.novelsweets.com.  Bar Charlotte, you will have to experience them for yourself, wonderful presentation! Pure Pizza smells so good! There is a meat market, a bakery that makes fresh breads and sandwiches, a CMC clinic (just in case). Oh before I forget, Charlotte Tea & Spice Co. and another shop that had a person working there that wasn't too friendly that served coffee, tea, etc. I had a wonderful time! That will be one of my go to spots! 90 min. validated parking. 2 blocks down from the Epicenter."}
{"text":"I really love everything about this place! It is my favorite spot in Charlotte.   All of the restaurant selections are absolutely delicious and FRESH! The people that work here are all really nice and personable. I've visited and purchased items from all of the vendors. There's a great pasta stand there where you can buy all types from Italy and the owner is very helpful.   I also really love the farmers market style in the back of the market. The nice older man there is very sweet and always helpful in helping me pick out products. I like to support local businesses. I'm excited to try Out the meats from the butcher soon!"}
{"text":"I expected more from such a famous spot in Charlotte. The market area was small, offering a limited variety of cafes and shops. We had a coffee at their May cafe and it was average. Very cute though, see picture. Parking is expensive at the building garage. Park across the street."}
{"text":"Love it here! I think I found my new favorite place for breakfast lunch and dinner! There are so many awesome specialty vendors here: body products, wines, meats, cheese, bakery! It also great that they have \"all-day\" hours. Parking is also validated for the first 90-min (There is a little machine to validate parking straight ahead across from the entrance closest to the structured parking near the bulletin board). I have been to a few of the stations and most of them are very eager to provide samples. There are plenty of benches/tables to sit inside and outside of the market."}
{"text":"Is more of a small town market with food mid level gourmet type of a food  According to the internet review was a must place to visit but, frankly I was not impressed. However, it will be a perfect place to grab a bite and to get a cup of coffee.  There are historic places near by to walk and see also, a park with some modern type designs."}
{"text":"When people ask, \"Where should I take my out of town guests,\" I always say the 7th Street Market.   The vendors have something for everyone -- sushi, burgers, juice, coffee, crepes, pizza, sweets -- you name it. It does get crowded here during lunchtime on weekdays and pretty much all day on Saturdays and Sundays. It's worth the wait.   If you have an after work event in Uptown and need to kill some time between the work day and your event, stop in and grab a happy hour beer from Tank's Tap. It's mostly local beer from breweries like Triple C, NoDa and Birdsong.   Make sure to validate your parking for the attached deck. (The machine is on the counter near Bonsai Fusion. You just stick your ticket into the machine, it prints a code on it, and you insert it in the machine at the gate as you leave the deck. The first 90 minutes are free.) Otherwise, take the light rail or ride a B-cycle over. There's a bike share dock outside of the market, and the light rail lets you out right in front."}
{"text":"Fun Indoor Market with Pizza, cheese, beer, And some other less important food groups."}
{"text":"I love spots like this. It's like an urban market that houses local gourmet food and drink. Awesome eateries, a chocolatier, a cupcakery, a sushi spot, etc. Reminds of a tiny tiny chelsea market.  We got coffee here and walked around. They also sell artisan soaps and i was so tempted to take one home with me! They smell amazing.  There's even a cheese shop here! and a raw smoothie bar too! Very cool little place."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the past few weeks and while I sincerely miss Reids, there are a lot of awesome vendors here now!    I LOVE the coffee stand - they always remember what I order and are super friendly.  They have a nice bar and table area if you want to sit or you can get your joe-to-go and wander to the other stands.  Right now they have a wine vendor, raw juice vendor, Pure pizza (YUM!!!), Fran's Filling Station (bacon-wrapped tater tots whhaaaa!!!), farmers market, butcher, sushi spot and I am sure much more that I missed.  The prices are reasonable and all of the workers are super friendly.  There are plenty of tables in the common area for you to sit and have lunch - or if it isn't too hot - outside :-D  Love it here!!"}
{"text":"This location functions very well as a station.  It's the starting point from uptown.  There's a market here with local vendors providing goods and services so you can shop a bit, grab a bite of food, coffee,  and relax a bit before boarding the train.   So long as the train leaves on time, it's 5 stars in my  book;)."}
{"text":"I love the \"market\" atmosphere and the variety that is available.  BUT, every time I have bene to the market, only certain vendors are open.  I went last Monday at lunch time and only the Sushi place, coffee, and cupcake place was open.  I was hoping to get a sandwich or salad, but there was nothing open at lunch time offering those options.  So I wandered to the \"farmer's market\" area in the back and landed a small potato salad, that had chicken in it?  Was good, but would have been nice if they had something to go with it!  There was honey, soap, cheese...and potato salad.  Very random in my opinion.  Anyway, maybe I have caught it on off times?) although I would think lunch time would be primetime?  Cute be a great place but just a bit all over the place as far as options are concerned."}
{"text":"I love coming to 7th street market! You'll find here: ricos acai, the local loaf, tanks tap, pure pizza, sushi place, hazelnuts crepes, not just coffee, a bakery, some wine & cheeses, a sandwich spot, and a new spot in the back I'm blanking on name. Good yummy options here! My FAV part: they validate your parking! If you park in 7th street garage, bring in your parking ticket and validate inside (currently near the bakery spot - you'll see the little machine). It's good for 1.5 hours I do believe! Free parking always helps :)"}
{"text":"A great stop for coffee, dessert, lunch, breakfast or dinner. There is a great variety of food and even crafts in this space. Not just coffee and the Local loaf are both favorites. Be sure to get your parking validated."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're traveling in a group, and everyone is craving something different to eat. There's sushi, pizza, breakfast foods, beers, wines, pastries, sandwiches..sigh. I wish I was super hungry to try more of the foods there. After making a few rounds to see what was good, I settled on Bonsai Fusion and tried the Ahi Poke Bowl. It was pretty damn tasty.  I liked that I could also take my food over to Tank's Tap to enjoy a beer with my lunch. It's nice to have so many options in the same venue. I love these public markets with options, a real people pleaser!"}
{"text":"Coffee, pizza, groceries, cheese, artisan bread and sushi.... oh and dessert. Yup - cool spot! And right on the light rail. Stop! It's a great place to meet for lunch when you are catching up with a big group. I love the urban feel. Rainy days sitting at Not Just Coffee is the best. I even like dates with the man here - cruise the produce then share a pizza while planning the next evenings dinner. I never leave without a loaf of bread either. Don't judge me! I love that 7th Street highlights NorthCarolina products and some truly talented people."}
{"text":"Fantastic resource for Charlotte. Real sushi, real crepes, fresh beer, individualized coffee creations, artisanal grilled cheese sandwiches, zesty real pizza, desserts, bread, soup and sandwiches, and fragrant hand made soap.  Only wish it would stay open later. It has a similar feel to Amelie's 24/7/365 coffee a d bakery in NoDa, but be sure to check the closing time, eg 8pm on Saturdays.  Conveniently located right at the Seventh Street stop of the Lynx Blue Line."}
{"text":"I LOVE 7th Street Market. There are so many options for food (craft/local) as well as drink and they validate parking. #winning  Loving coming here for the best pie in town at Pure Pizza and washing it down with a local brew or yummy sushi rolls at Bonsai Fusion and a cup of hot tea at Not Just Coffee.  There's also artisan cheese, and amazing seafood, and a juice stand, and a handcrafted chocolate booth, and a bakery, and a sandwich shop, and oh goodness I can go on!  Seriously, go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yeah - this place just plain rocks! Amazing collection of shops and restaurants! So my day went like this - Cloud 9: cookies and ice cream, Hazelnuts: breakfast crepe, Pure Pizza: lunch time!!, Not Just Coffee; caffeine pick me up and Tank's Tap: ice cold brew because I've earned it!! Great concept with a great feel! Hustling and bustling with people enjoying the finer things in life!"}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this place!! This is a perfect place for a lazy weekend. I normally start out with a drink from Tank's Tap (to fight off the hangover lol), then order the steak sandwich from Local Loaf Bakery, last but not least have the delicious expresso shots from Not Just Coffee. This is not to mention there are yummy crepes from Hazelnut and the fresh sashimi from Bonsai Fusion. This place is a must-stop!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I wasn't really impressed when this place opened up well over a year ago.  Mostly because there wasn't really a presence of vendors yet.  Now, now there are plenty of great places here and I hear that they are adding Salud Beer Shop's inventory which makes it nearly perfect!    This is a great spot to kill some time on weekends for me due to it being a close walk and then farmer's market here provides some great additions to the kitchen come meal time."}
{"text":"I love this place, the service isn't that great at Bonzai Fusion Sushi. The guy and girl aren't friendly or welcoming at all during lunch hours. That was the time I went and it's unfortunate because I really love 7th street and Bonzai sushi burritos. But they are never friendly around this time... LoL! Maybe because of rush hour, but that's when you want to be your friendliest I would think?  All in all the burrito was great, this was the first time I've tried it without the tortilla. The soy paper was great, the burrito just fell apart as I got to the bottom. But I think that was due to the soy sauce I added.   Oh and the now have chopstick guides which is great for my friend who's learning to use chopsticks {please excuse him he's a working progress }   Overall I really love 7th street Market!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Writing a review of a place that is still in the process of \"becoming\" is a tricky venture, but given the vendors already in place and the dedication to local sourcing and home-grown business that is evident, I'm already a fan and can only say the future is looking very bright.  First thing to know, this former grocery store has been converted into a large indoor pavillion with a number of independent vendors having dedicated space within.  It's like a year-round farmer's market with and handful of local small businesses thrown in.  The biggest being the Farm Stand and the Meat and Fish Co.  The Farm Stand is really a conglomeration of many farmers and purveyors of local produce who get a little bit of shelf space and utilize a central selling point.  A look here is awesome- from micro greens to local cheeses and gormet ravioli.  Seasonal produce is available, as well.  All is local.  The Not Just Coffee Shop is at the bar and serves some amazing pour over coffee and espresso beverages- they are really making art here and should be a first stop before perusing the other vendors.  I am also a fan of The Dough Bowl, a local bakery that originates from a farm in Morganton.  Whether you just want a fresh-baked croissant or a hearty loaf of bread made from locally milled flours, they are serious artisan bakers.    Nelly Naturals and the Bond Street Wine Co. also have small outposts in the middle of the market, with gourmet snacks and fine wines available for purchase.  Saturdays tend to be the big day here, but this place is a hidden gen in the middle of the week.  Given that they occupy the bottom of the 7th Street Parking Deck and validate your parking for the first hour and a half, there's really nothing to lose by shopping here, and everything to gain by helping local businesses and farmers.  Even more exciting are the businesses on their way here.  Pure Pizza will open soon with a farm to table pizza concept that sounds out of this world.  Given one of the chefs backing the effort, I am sure there are great things to come from this.  Tasty Yo frozen yogurt is also planning to set up shop here, and they were one of the first to bring the tart yogurt trend to the local scene.  No doubt they will be popular in the summer.  Fran's Filling Station, a well-loved spot down in Dilworth, also has signage indicating they are coming soon.  Not sure what the final concept will be here, but given their large following at their current location, I can imagine there will be plenty coming from this kitchen as well.  So a central place to eat and shop, knowing your purchases are locally sourced and will keep your dollars in the local economy, what's not to love here?  Given the vendor line up and those on the way, the future does indeed look very bright for the public market.  This is local, done best."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on our road trip from NY to Austin, Texas. We found it online and decided to stop by before we hit the road again which was a great choice. We had coffee from Not Just Coffee and biscuits and gravy and the chicken and Biscuit meals from Local Loaf Bakery. Everything tastes great and I even got asked by people walking by where I got my breakfast from.   Dope spot, I recommend it. I wish we had more time to kick it there because it began to get more lively when we finished breakfast. They validate your parking too by the way so you don't end up paying for parking."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot for weekend brunch, which is usually my reason for going. My go-to is heading to Local Loaf and ordering chocolate chip pancakes with the Jack Daniel syrup. This pancake is unlike any pancake that's ever come out of my kitchen! It's a little bit crispy and crunchy and the flavors are awesome.  Then, I head over to Not Just Coffee and get myself a cortado, which is a nice little caffeine boost. A few times I varied this routine and ordered a sweet crepe from Hazelnuts. I've also been once for lunch and ate at Pure Pizza, and once for a wine tasting (every Tuesday night I believe) through the Assorted Table Wine Shop. I love how varied and eclectic this place is; there's seriously something for everyone."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed here. My wife had told me this is going to be like a Quincy market or a Brooklyn shmorgishborg.  Options were limited, luckily my wife had preplanned that we would be eating at the grilled cheese place. It was good, nothing special. But overall a cool market, I just wish there was more but maybe it will grow in the future years."}
{"text":"I don't live near uptown and have been mired in my \"Ballantyne Universe\" for a while, but HOLD ON WAIT A MINUTE.  We ventured uptown on a Saturday late morning to catch a show and went to the market for the sole reason to check out Pure Pizza.   Parked in the parking deck and rode down the elevator to the market and when I walked in a smile came across my face and I literally had a \"moment\"....you know what I'm talking about, the moment when you realize that this is the place that you had always hoped would come to your town.  A virtual cornucopia of fresh local fruit, sushi, coffee, chocolate, popsicles, meat, pizza, confections etc....Sweetie handed me a tissue to wipe the tears of joy off my face and we proceeded in.  If you have not been here yet, get off Yelp right now and go.  There is something for everyone here.  I love actually speaking to people about what they're selling, it's such a refreshing change from the Tween behind the register stoically asking \"did you find everything ok?\".  We had Pure Pizza (see my review), and a cupcake from Cloud 9.  We watched scores of people walk away from Local Loaf with artisan breads and sandwiches.  I spoke to the Salt of the Earth people.....who knew there was so much to salt?  I do now!  Local, fresh and surprisingly affordable produce was purchased by Sweetie.  The meat and seafood in the back was well presented and something I will have to return for.  There were raw juices, and a nice spot for coffee.  The weather outside was gloomy, but there were more vendors out there to peruse.  A few other local people selling and sampling BBQ Sauce were all fun to speak with.  The King of Pops was there and if I wasn't about to explode from eating my whole pizza I would have tried one.  This is a place you can go broke in easily, because you want to try everything and support these local vendors.  For someone who is passionate about food and the new, local movement, this place is great.  I will be back and can't wait to try the things I missed on my first trip."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite spots in Uptown Charlotte? Sushi burritos, ice cream, amazing coffee, beer, wine, pizza, sandwiches...you name it they most likely have it! Yes I did say sushi burrito! Go to Bonsai Fusion and get one! Pure Pizza's original location is in here too! Not Just Coffee has everything when you need a caffeine pick me up! Make sure you stop here! They also validate parking for up ton 90 minutes."}
{"text":"So many wonderful options! I went to food good and picked local loaf. I love the food there but I also love the atmosphere of the whole place. I would def recommend it to everyone in the area. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a farmers market. They have everything you could ask for. From a butcher and a baker but no candlestick maker(I think) it all has a very young hip feel. Every time I come here something new has opened up. Today it is Tanks Tap a small craft beer bar. They have a lineup of local beers on tap and a bunch more in cans and bottles. They have a special growler fill station that will infuse co2 so it lasts for weeks. Very friendly people so I will be stoping by more often!"}
{"text":"Great place! I felt like I was back in Portland minus the bad attitudes and with a few less hipsters! Great options for food, coffee, desert, wine, beer and a farmers market. Very neat place!  The sushi is very good and fresh. Definitely get the side salad, which had avocado and tomatoes! The crepes can't be beat next kiosk over. My family enjoyed the sandwiches from the deli. Right next to the light rail stop. They validate parking too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm very jealous there isn't something like this where I live in Raleigh.  Multiple small food vendors and a farmers market type place share one common area to sit. The food venders include coffee, pizza, sushi, bakery, deli, and a bar.    I'd recommend checking out this little market!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Right along the light rail! In the warmer months it's perfect to sit outside and watch the light rail.  Great variety of restaurants and little shops in this market. There's parking above- we use it a lot for Hornets games.  There's a bar in the middle where you can grab a beer or wine to walk around to the different local vendors! Cute place to check out"}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can think to say about the 7th Street Market is the food choices are all too good. It's hard to pick just one spot for lunch or dinner! I mean, you could have sushi at Bonsai. You could have pizza from Pure. You could have a grilled cheese from Orman's. You could get a sandwich or salad from Local Loaf. How is one expected to choose between all that?! Thank God there's only one place for beer! Tanks Tap, here I come! I'm going to need a beer to calm my nerves after all these decisions. ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a cool little spot to hangout on a Saturday morning and get some amazing coffee/eats. They also have a little grocery store that carries local produce, make sure you get there early if you plan to purchase any because it gets picked over quickly. Lines can be a drag to order food and coffee but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"i really did enjoy  the variety of items within the market. It's a little pricey past &15 bucks for pizza with a side salad . the fresh veggie market could use some fresher product but the seafood market look wonderful. I do recommend if you are downtown. don't forget to validated you parking ticket"}
{"text":"My favorite place downtown! So many options for brunch, lunch, dinner without any lines or wait times or reservations needed! Crepes are my fav. Good for groups, dates, families, or cup of coffee and people watching. Definitely a part of the Charlotte. Uglier and I recommend checking it out. Parking in the garage next door and there's a machine to get your ticket validated inside."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Drink a beer or coffee, eat some great food, shop for local produce and meat, sample some bitters...truly a great place to go and hang out. Also great for people watching!!"}
{"text":"I was just an out of towner, passing through.  The market was worth a look but wasn't as big or bustling or locally-oriented as I had hoped.     The cheese shop inside was the only booth that caught my attention for any period of time.  Cheeses from all over NC and beyond, samples provided.  They also had other goodies - we picked up a nice salami and some Brooklyn Bloody Mary mix that you can't typically find.  Hopefully this place will grow and thrive.  Go!  Buy something!"}
{"text":"Looove this place!! My favorite has to be the pure pizza, the chorizo pizza, wow! So good...  Also the pecan pie from the bakery right next to pure pizza, (forgot the name) but is the best I have ever had. The place is not that loud, and its just clean and family friendly... The parking on that building though is a no -no! Too pricey."}
{"text":"It is my first time in CLT, I am starving.  I come upon a huge ass parking deck, and a sign that says market... You better believe I took the illegal turn into the deck!  Did I get dirty looks? Of course, but do you not see the outta state plate?  I was excited, really excited, to take the elevator down 4 floors and check out this market that looks like it takes up a city block.    And then sis and I walk in...  It looked like we were trespassing, like they were about to close, and we were not supposed to be there.  The few people that were in there wondered why we came.  Because it's and f'in market, and I am hungry- that's why!  I will admit, the space is nice, and a lot of glass keeps it bright, but it just seems way too open for a market.  you have a few places on the side (that each sell their own specialty), and a few places in the middle.  We spent about 2- 3 minutes at each place to see what they offered, and interesting enough, only one person (I think from the butcher) asked us if we needed any help with anything, we respectfully declined (as the power in the house wasn't fully set up to cook anything and a bonfire was out of the question).  For 6:00 on a Friday evening, that was a very awkward experience.    A few pluses- the food LOOKED good, but God forbid anyone had to get off their ass to make something.   The space was very clean, I can see a foodie having a reception here, no problem.  I like the location, as their are a few bars around, and there is a street trolley right outside as well.  Maybe Friday's are off days in the markets in CLT, who the hell knows...  Oh yea, and I still had to pay $2 for parking, only there for 18 minutes (if that). As I just read another Yelper's review, he said that there is parking validation there... Nice Tom, nice...  I have seen bigger and better in other cities, but if it is a great fit for the city, then more power to them!"}
{"text":"The 7th Street Market is an awesome little market boasting some very impressive food and drink options. Literally everything in the market is within your line of sight. I went early Sunday morning to grab coffee at Not Just Coffee and breakfast at Local Loaf. The coffee is top quality and Local Loaf does French breakfast unlike anything I've had before. The chicken and egg biscuit is a must try at Local Loaf. It is amazingly good. There's also  a really good crepe place called Hazelnut crepes that serves some fantastic cooking crepes. Various other local vendors are there selling local products as well. Overall, it's just a fun and delicious local market that's a must visit when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As an outsider, I dont get why other reviewers are so excited about this place. For a farmers market, this place has a limited selection & overpriced goods. For a shopping spot, I found it totally lacking. It may be good for a lunch spot if you work in the area. They did a great job if this is what the place was intended to be, but I wouldn't have waste your time on a special trip here."}
{"text":"What a great little spot to pick up some local fare.. -Local cheeses -Local Fruits/Veggies -Local treats (baked goods, honey, crackers) -Local Juice/ Vegan Fare -Local Grass fed beef & fresh local seafood -Wine & Beer -flowers  -coffee -sushi -pizza -other foods... (take & bake, prepared etc.)  They come at a bit of a higher price point but overall you're strengthening the community you live in and getting to try some really unique/high quality products.  Most vendors proudly offered samples and  I even noticed a sign for wine-tasting. They also took debit, though I'm sure cash is preferred.   I love that parking is validated though the process has thrown some for a loop. Park. Shop up to 90 minutes, RIGHT BEFORE YOU LEAVE - (and before your 90min is up) Validate using the machine across from the sushi joint by the door. You will then have 20 minutes from that moment to drive through the exit gate. It definitely is a little process but it is so worth it.  I'll certainly come again...and this time I'm buying some of that fabulous cheese I sampled : )"}
{"text":"Family favorite with something for everyone. We got a bit addicted to going here on Sundays and had to cut back not.  The acacia bowls are very good with all fresh ingredients. And I love the salads and soups from local loaf.   On the way out we pick up a bag of popcorn. Try the fried chicken... it'll surprise you. They need to be selling this stuff in theaters."}
{"text":"This market really has it all y'all. I imagine it'd be nice to visit during the weekdays but I've only ever visited on the weekends with my schedule. It gets fairly crowded around lunch time on Saturday and Sunday. There really is a little bit of everything. If you can't find it here you'll find it within walking distance fairly close by. There's a parking garage where I've never been without a parking space. Bring your ticket with you to the market because you can get it validated there. Take the light rail to here or from here - it stops right outside the doors. Also you must know the little Easter Egg on the outside of the building. Find the red panels with handprints on them and slap your hand there to light up the side of the whole building and play a funky sound.  Moving inside, where do I begin? Restaurant options include sushi, sandwiches and bread, pizza and Italian. Along the way you'll find coffee, tea, beer and even a juice bar. Towards the back there are a few permanent-ish shops with southern style knick-knacks, spices, chocolates, wine and collectibles. There are even a few bicycles for sale hanging from the ceiling. There aren't a whole lot of tables inside but for nicer days there's probably just as many outside that you can expand onto. At the front near the door there seem to be a few small boutique-like shops that are ever-rotating. Last I saw was a book-seller/exchange.  Prices vary though I'd say they're on the high-average end of things. My favorite restaurant is Local Loaf. I'm also a sucker for the expensive juices at Viva Raw. I have to get back in here for a beer too. Depending on which shop you find yourself at the staff friendliness varies. They often seem just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people in here. It can get loud and anxiety inducing so you might want to stay away if that kind of environment stresses you out."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I really do. I can really appreciate a spot where I can get a bowl of fruits and granola and my boyfriend can get a giant sandwich/pizza/whatever and everyone is happy and no one compromises. And Not Just Coffee lives here too-- which if you haven't tried any of their locations-- do yourself a favor and go right now.   I like to walk around before/after eating something delicious from Rico's or Local Loaf. They have cute crafty stuff, cheese and wine, fresh vegetables, and pimento cheese. There are tables in the middle, but I prefer to eat outside with my pup."}
{"text":"I love this place.  If you're into supporting your fellow Charlottean or North Carolinian (as you should be) then 7th Street Public Market is the place to be.  Located immediately off the light rail line, it's a place for local people buying local things made from local products.  They care about the details that go into their craft, not just the finished product.  Organic, local, handmade, small farm, all things that these vendors care so much about.  My favorite shops here are:  NOT JUST COFFEE - DUH!  Just go there. ORRMAN'S CHEESE SHOP - Rachel knows her cheese and her cheese makers.  Get a sample and pick up some other local specialties here (i.e. Cloister Honey). LOCAL LOAF - Awesome breakfast and lunch.  Fresh bread.  What more do you need?! GREENEMAN FARMS - Local food for local people.  From produce to milk and eggs to preserves.  I love this place.  Seriously, go there!"}
{"text":"Sue me, I like flea markets. I really like indoor markets, such as Lexington Market in Baltimore, New Castle Market in Delaware and Reading Terminal in Philadelphia.  I wish that Charlotte had something similar. It's not a farmer's market, though there are similarities - it's a meeting place, a food bazaar (and bizarre in some cases). It's just a bunch of shops, probably more similar to an indoor flea market. Charlotte, being as upscale as we think we are, have a bunch of upscale-like shops (many of which are), and that's a good thing - but it's a small market. Much like Atherton, you can walk through the whole thing in ten minutes.  Spend your time wisely. Get a coffee, a grilled cheese, and take some salt or tea home, but even with that you're likely to come out with time to spare on the free validated parking in the garage."}
{"text":"Every time we go here, there are more businesses sprouting inside. We started off with Not Just Coffee which is a nice little coffee bar, and of course, my absolute favorite, Pure Pizza. There is a sushi place, desserts (cakes and ice cream), deli and juice bar, all of which look real good. They also have a spice shop, a salt shop (salts of the world), wine and beer shop, fresh meat and seafood, fruits & veggies. The good thing about this is, even if I'm eating at pure pizza, I can bring my coffee cup or glass of wine over as long as I bring it back.  They also validate parking for 90 minutes, but be careful, twice the machine failed to print the validation bar code and we had to pay for parking."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was my first time here. Nice area with a good selection of things to eat or drink. Came here with some out of towners and they loved the whole experience. We did some shopping. Got some hot drinks and walked around a bit. I decided to get some hot chocolate and it was so good! There are lots of tables to sit. Everyone we encountered was super friendly. I would love to come here again and try something else out!"}
{"text":"Cool concept, slight miss on execution. Half the booths are closed on Sunday. No designated parking just for the market, we got turned away across the street by the church organization. Parking garage closest to it charges $2 per 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I just love 7th Street Market. If you have visitors coming into Charlotte, take them here! It has a great vibe to it. There are lots of places to eat from fruit and yogurt bowls, to sushi, to gourmet pizza, to crepes. There is a farmers market, bakery, wine shop, juice shop, and jam shop. There is a little something for everyone. Also if you get your parking validated, you can park in the garage for two hours for free! What a deal :)"}
{"text":"I get physically angry when people tell me that they've never been here. Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration. Or maybe it's not. *Shakes fist in air. Get off my lawn*  First of all, they have a validation machine for parking at Seventh Street Station. That's right, FREE PARKING IN UPTOWN. The validation machine is located on a shelf to the left side of Bonsai Sushi Fusion. Just stick your ticket in and go. TWSS. Warning: validation is only good for 90 minutes of free parking. So, move your car every hour and a half if you need longer. There is also a light rail stop here.   The only problem I have with this place is that I can easily drop $40 quickly because there are so many amazing vendors here. There's a little bit of everything here and I want it all.   Not Just Coffee: my favorite place for a caffeine fix. The lattes are works of art.  Pure Pizza: farm to fork concept. The chorizo will change your life. Viva Raw: fresh pressed juices. Not sure which one you'll like? They'll let you sample to see! The beet juice is my favorite. Tank's Tap: great selection of local beers. Local Loaf: lunch or brunch, they're both delicious. Try the signature chicken and the egg or the biscuits and gravy. Bonsai Sushi Fusion: super creative rolls, including a sushi burrito.  I could go on forever. There's not a bad vendor here. Assorted Table Wine Shop, Orrman's Cheese Shop, Hazelnut's Creperie, Cloud 9 Confections and more. You can even get amazing treats from barChocolate. I highly recommend the ghost chili ones. They are so unique and delicious.   I am so happy that uptown not only has such a great market like this, but they put a lot of support into it. I can't wait to see how this place continues to grow with the new park going up across the street. A moment of silence for Dixie's, please...."}
{"text":"For such an early review, you have to take it for what it is. 7th Street Market is still under construction, and not all of the tenants have completed their spaces yet.  That said, this is something Charlotte has been yearning for. It's a huge open space where Ried's used to be with a dozen or so stalls that feature local businesses and an wealth of organic, locally sourced and sustainable food. Bakeries, butchers, produce, coffee, wine, pizza, and a second location for Fran's Filling Station, plus more to come. On my visits (I've been a couple of times so far), there has been live music and an interesting mix of people hanging out in the seating areas central to the space. It takes on the feel of a big-city farmer's market and is the perfect spot to spend an afternoon.    I've very interested to see how much more vibrant the market becomes once it's completely finished!"}
{"text":"Cute enough. It needs more vendors. It has the potential to be a Chelsea Market in NYC."}
{"text":"Whenever we are visiting Charlotten we start our day here.  It's a fantastic group of local and regional farmers, food artisans, and entrepreneurs with more than 15 restaurants and shops.  Our favorites were Local Loaf (try the Croque Madame!) and Not Just Coffee.  They also have a creperie and bakery as well as a cheese shop (with gourmet grilled cheese!), sushi bar, pizza counter, and cocktail bar for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Cute market place. Good to hang out with friends for some food, beers and wine. But the main object is to shop. As this stuff is ridiculously expensive and totally overpriced, I do not shop here. But I love to browse and enjoy the ambiance when hanging out with friends here for coffee or beer. One thing that is worth shopping for here, is the local honey, the wine (expensive but great and rare choices) and the local/organic produce/fruits/meat. Sometimes you can score a great deal there. Nicely located uptown right next to the light rail and hopefully in the summer, I will be able to enjoy the outside area as well."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment of riches, and one stop that I always recommend to virtually all visitors and newcomers to Charlotte because it's got so many great small businesses under one (conveniently located) roof.  Need a last minute gift? Dying for caffeine fix? Rough day at the office and you really need a (craft) beer? Want to assemble the perfect cheese board? And pair it with the perfect wine because you're fancy? Taking a group to lunch but somebody's on a juice cleanse and everyone is craving something different?  7th Street Public Market has got your back."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  I'm trying to review for the meat market located in the back.   Alllllllrightyyyy Theeeen  Finally I have found what I've been looking for. A selection of different kind of meats. No no noooo not the regular chicken, beef, turkey, duck. They have a pretty nice assortment of different meats. Clean and void of foul smells. Looked pretty fresh (all yelp reviews aren't complete without \"Freshest\" in it). Now I met my \"Fresh\" quota I can proceed.   A few guys in the back chopping & packin. I don't wanna repeat what others may have already wrote. However, I ran with Aligator (1LB = 16.99) & Turtle (1LB = 6.99) yeah yeah yeah ohh not turtle. Yes!! Lol  I'll be back most def!  TTFN"}
{"text":"I really love this place. They have a variety of natural foods from local farmers, vegan dishes, fresh seafood, and much more. I was able to purchase local honey, a bottle of sweet red (wine), and eat a veggie pizza. The environment is laid back. I never have a bad experience. The cost of products are reasonable."}
{"text":"After spending time at Abbeydale, we decided to head over to 7th Street to grab lunch.  The place was packed! Great weather brought folks out early!  We had an Acai bowl which was perfect for a light early lunch.  I walked around to see about produce anddddd I couldn't find any?? The market now just consists of placed to eat, grab coffee or a beer, wine cheeses and juices from viva raw. There was a section that was covered up so perhaps more items were under there?  Nonetheless,  it was great to get out and hang out at 7th street!"}
{"text":"This is a really great and fun thing to do on he weekends with family and friends.  There are many cool places to check out for food, coffee, wine, and dessert.  There is so much quality food to eat!! I love food, obviously, so I was pretty impressed.  The market it walkable and does get crowded on the weekends. They validate parking for 90 minutes and there is a self scanner to scan your parking ticket, so don't forget before you leave!  You have to park in the garage right next door for the validation   The people are friendly and the atmosphere is awesome!  Great place to people watch!  I came recently and hope to be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite, especially with a group of people with different tastes.  Sushi, Crepe, beer, coffee, cheese, sandwiches, pizza, wine, deli.... its got a great variety.  Not fancy, not expensive, just a bunch of local small businesses worthy of our support. AND, parking at the 7th street garage is free (up to 90 minutes)."}
{"text":"Discovered 7th Street Market after trying to find \"Not Just Coffee\"....I didn't realize it was located in the market.  First time there it was close to closing time so a lot of the shops had already closed up.  Had some awesome coffee and my wife got a pastry from \"Cloud 9 Bakery\"....which she loved!  We went back last weekend around 3:00pm on a Saturday and more stores were open (The market has new hours to stay open later on Sat and close on Sun) and it was busier.  We had some coffee to start, then tried \"Pure Pizza\" which was delicious and our new favorite pizza place, and finished off with a pastry.  The place is a real one-stop shop and has a great atmosphere.  I just wish that I lived closer to it (we live in a suburb north of Charlotte) so that we could go more often.    I would give a 5 star rating but I did have an issue with the free parking.  You are supposed to get 90mins free parking and they have little machines in the market to validate your ticket.  I validated it and everything appeared correct but when I went to leave the parking machine said that I owed $10.  I didn't think I had been there longer than the allotted free 90 mins but definitely not $10 longer.  So I ejected the card to try and take it to a real parking attendant but after ejecting it I looked over and saw there was no one in the booth....by that time another car pulled in behind me so I had to go ahead and use the automated pay kiosk. I re-inserted my ticket and all of the sudden the price was now $12.  I paid and left.  I am not sure if there was a problem with the validating machine or if something just screwed up..but the $12 parking did put a damper on our second visit (The first time we parked on the street).  So next time I will check the street first and then if I have to park in the garage...I will double check the validating!"}
{"text":"It's ok, it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market. there are nice vendors there, but it needs more market types."}
{"text":"Perfect destination for our party limo!  We had delicious popcorn to start (baskets supplied for serving), Pure Pizza for lunch (Gino is a rock star), and Cloud 9 cupcakes for dessert (vegan cupcakes and ice cream for girls with allergies). Party room kept our girls contained and sound proof. The assistance provided to pull this off was mind blowing, the extras I needed were given with no extra charge and everyone was more than happy to help. Everyone claimed this birthday was \"amazing\". The only suggestion would be to try to get in a few minutes early to decorate, we were pressed for time but in all honesty I don't think they noticed. Highly recommend this place if just for the excellent service with a smile. Thanks Chris!!!"}
{"text":"The 7th Street Public Market in Charlotte is a food court of sorts. There are several restaurants, bakeries, wine shops and a market. This seemed like a good spot to sample several dishes from different venues.  I was interested in trying Pure Pizza since they seemed to advertise a relationship with Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, which has been named the best pizza place in the country in numerous publications over the years. It turns out that the only similarity between Pure Pizza and Chris Bianco is that they use the same tomatoes. By looking at their pizzas, one can see that is where the similarity ends.  We ordered the T-Rex which includes bacon, sausage, pepperoni and ground beef. The pizza had a nice char, maybe too much in certain spots. The toppings were plentiful and evenly distributed. The crust was nice and chewy. If you are a meat lover this pizza is a winner.  At Local Loaf, we got the Chicken & the Egg, which is a deep fried boneless chicken breast sitting atop a mound of cheese, with a honey BBQ sauce. The sandwich also included a fried egg with a runny yolk of course. There must have been a mistake to my order as some sprouts ended up on the sandwich, LOL. This massive behemoth was sandwiched between a buttery biscuit. This isn't a sandwich that can be eaten without causing a serious mess. It hit all of the notes too: salty, sweet, fried, crunchy. It comes with a cucumber salad to help cut down on the sweetness of the honey BBQ sauce.  We finished the meal off with a Banana Nutella crepe at Hazelnut Crepes. The filling was plentiful, the banana ripe with streams of Nutella running throughout. The crepe itself was a little doughy, but good overall.  7th Street Marketplace is probably not a food destination on its own, but does a good job of servicing the downtown area during lunch time as the place was packed.  The food at the places we ate were well executed and fairly priced."}
{"text":"There's literally a little bit of everything: coffee, tea, raw foods, baked goods, meat, seafood, pizza, sushi, wine, cheese... The real issue is where my bed is going to go because I could totally live in this place...   I love the set-up... It's all indoors, but it's more like an open air market than a structured type of business... You can lazily meander about and experience everything... I can only imagine the energy on a busy Saturday morning...   I purchased a yummy and potent pour over from Not Just Coffee, turned around and picked up some Salsa Verde kale chips from the raw foods stand directly behind me... They also have some of those healthy, but interesting smoothies and give samples... Why not try something new?  I walked through the space where the wine is because they were closed and found a whoooooole butcher situation on the back end of the market... They have everything... Fresh meat and seafood, prepared and ready to cook meals, frozen options... It was mindboggling... There's a guy selling jams and preserves, a cheese stand that had a huge inventory of tasty looking choices... Oh! Pure Pizza!  They have a pizza with limes on it... I didn't get it but it's on my list... Cloud 9... Heavenly desserts... Just dreamy...  Bonsai Sushi Fusion blew my whole mind (check out the review for deets) and I'm thinking there's a guy with spices for some reason, but I'm not sure if I'm dreaming that quite honestly... I'm pretty sure there's a spice guy, though... Oh! And there's fruit!  I could see spending a whole morning in here... Especially if it's raining and I don't want to go to an outdoor market... This is a perfect alternative and a great choice for exploration..."}
{"text":"Great place if you are trying to avoid chains and eat like the locals do. It's like an incubator for small business in Charlotte from sushi burritos to cheese from all over the world. The community gives you a chance to enjoy your food while meeting new people and figuring out what you're going to have next time. Conveniently locate doff of the 7th street light rail station and College Street in Uptown, it's a gem."}
{"text":"This is Charlotte to me!    Local produce, chefs, and people.  I could write a nice long lengthy review here but I think it would serve you best if I just told you that it is in my top 3 favorite places to hang out and get lunch, coffee, and unique locally-made gifts.    Not Just Coffee -- 10 out of 10.  (See my review)  Best coffe, chai, tea in Uptown.  Local Loaf -- 9 out of 10.  Fresh baked bagguettes and all around unique sandwich choices.  Fresh made on the spot chips and cucumber salad.  Try the steak sandwich - WOW!  The deli counter, the wine store, pure pizza, the fresh local produce, sushi....  They have it all!  If you stop there for a bite, you will thank me.  And whatever little gift you cant find for that one neighbor that you need to get something for.  Head over to the shop that sells unique blends of spices, popcorn, and teas.  Bam!  Count it!  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Crepes were absolutely delicious I had the strawberry, banana Nutella crepe and it was delicious but! My friend ordered the curry chicken crepe and it took everything in me not to steal her plate it was SOOO delicious. Both were incredibly delicious and priced perfectly for the quality. Just go get some and stop reading this review! Haha"}
{"text":"Such a great spot to bring out-of-town guests, eat, shop, and people-watch. It's right next to ImaginOn, so stop by here before/after you bring the kiddos there.   I've been a few times: the first time to try the Chicken and the Egg sandwich from Local Loaf (Cheerwine honey sauce, oh my god) and another time we ordered from Pure Pizza. The pizza was good, but I still haven't found any pizza joint in Charlotte that comes close to Lilly's Pizza in Raleigh. But they serve their pizza with a side of honey for your crust, which was an original touch. The market is bustling and lively and it could use more seating, but overall, I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out when you've got time between meetings or just want to people watch for a bit. I first discovered the market when I found Not Just Coffee here in 2013. I got to try Pure Pizza & Tank's Taps on my last business trip in December 2014.   The market can get busy during the typical times (lunch hour, happy hour, etc) but it offers a little bit of everything to it's patrons. I haven't tried the Meat Market, but I've been very tempted. Next time through town I'll have to remember to pack a cooler to take things home with me. I've seen these 'markets' pop up in other cities and be successful. I yearn for the day Jacksonville can open one and have it succeed."}
{"text":"A cool little eat in Market in the heart of uptown. Have a drink, shop, eat or have a snack. Its go it all, even tea shirts. We experienced this as part of a Food De Tour and  loved walking around. Wish the free parking was just not an hour as we got no discount even thought we were validated. Park across the street for half the $$"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great place to relax for a bit and is the perfect place to go if you want options or are with a group. I obviously didn't try every vendor but the layout & location are great, there's a ton of natural light and they validate your parking (from the attached garage) for the first 90minutes free.  Definitely try this place out for a unique market option downtown!"}
{"text":"The market reminds me of a fancier farmers market and with AC in the summer and heat in the winter!! There are so many different food options..all of which are amazing. I love that everything is local!! Its great for families or if you have guest visiting out of town. Very casual and cute! Lots of seating! Dont be afraid to try something new! Also has a fee local shops/vendors to get some local NC Charlotte souvenirs,etc while stopping. Parking across the st or just a walk away from any side street parking! Be ready for a relaxing enjoying the town kind of day, and if you go here..a full belly at a resonable price!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. I admire the hard working local entrepreneurs who are trying to make a go with fairly unique products and service. The venue does not have much atmosphere and the products offered are not unique enough to justify the sometimes expensive prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE Public Market! Everything we have tried at the restaurants has been awesome! The small market is great and the outdoor seating is fun! Never had a bad experience. It can get REALLY crowded at lunch time any day, so if you would like to hang out and relax, you might go early or late."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Lots of food vendors to chose from! We ordered pizza from a local farm pizza shop, food took a bit of time to get but it was Saturday afternoon, probably a normally very busy time. Sat at the counter of the tap house (? Not sure if that's what it was called), the bartender was a little on the rude side when we said we didn't want a beer menu, but the manger came around and was super nice as even took our dirty dishes. The place could expand, seating was very limited and it was very crowded and loud. The prices are a little on the high side, but it's understandable when these are small ma and pop shops."}
{"text":"Not quite Reading Terminal Market in Philly or Pikes Place in Seattle but a great spot for the Queen City!   It has just enough options to have everyone leaving happy and full! This is a great place for my wife and I to eat who can struggle at restaurants because I am a picky meat and potatoes kind of girl who doesn't like fish or seafood and she is tried and true pescatarian. I can choose a pizza from Pure, grilled cheese from Ormans Cheese Shop or a sweet Nutella filled crepe from Hazelnuts while she can enjoy Sushi at Bonsai Fusion or a fancy salad from Local Loaf all while washing it down with a local beer from Tank's Tap!  A few suggestions I have for newbies to the market is to 1) take a full loop around the market - survey your options, 2) check their hours before making a special trip their - for some reason they seem too short to me and some places close if it's slow, and 3) don't forget you can validate your parking as long as it's under 90 minutes!  Overall a SOLID choice for a place for all to eat in Uptown!"}
{"text":"Great market downtown (uptown) .  Lots of different little shops are with in the market.  During my visit it look like that have some great butcher meats.   The only things i got while i was there was salt from \"salts of the earth\" and coffee at NOT JUST COFFEE."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit!  Something for everyone...Hungry?  Stop and any of the great food choices...pizza, sushi, cheese, fresh bread, sandwiches, chocolate, juice! Thirsty?  Coffee, tea, craft beer.  Need some meat for a meal?  Meat market...need some veggies?  Farm stand.  Cupcakes?  They got em.  Great for a big or picky group because there is much to choose from!"}
{"text":"Next to a parking garage- it's a foodie's foodcourt. Lots of good choices with an upscale twist. Crepe's grilled cheeses, unique pizza's, couture coffee, wine shops and microbrews on tap.  It was a little crowded with families, but I came on a rainy day around 1pm. Pizza/garlic knots and crepes were delicious. Solid \"quick bite\" lunch type place. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"7th street market, I have such hopes for this place especially now that the light rail extension has opened. The first time I read about this place I was expecting it to be a lot bigger and more exciting.   My main issue is how early it closes and I hope that changes. Most places close around 7pm-8pm except a few that never seem to be open after 4pm like the sushi place.  It has a revolving list of stores with a few regulars.  If you are a craft beer person my suggestion is to get your food and eat it at the bar at Tanks and they have a good selection of locals beers.  On a nice day sit outside and watch the trains go by. Also note that they validate parking in the ramp for up to 90 minutes.  If you plan to stay longer than that my suggestion is to park somewhere else."}
{"text":"Three years since I last reviewed the 7th Street Public Market and it's matured a bit. On a busy Saturday morning with a cancer fund raiser on one side and a cultural festival to the other, the place was packed. Lots of people here at tables, eating, drinking, shopping. Impressive.  Vendors here offer all sorts of tasty treats including fresh customizable pizzas, draft local beers, pastries and breads, made-to-order crepes, fresh sushi, raw milk, awesome coffee and a wine shop. Wow!  Eat inside at one of the smaller/larger tables or take it outside near where the light rail stops."}
{"text":"Love this place, friendly people great options for anything you can think of (just about) Pure Pizza is awesome and good for you, NOW Tank*s Tap! Great local craft beer with great staff! Fun place to stop and have a beer and enjoy pizza or awesome sandwiches from Local Loaf. Either way there's something for everyone. I will for sure be stopping in more often!"}
{"text":"Coffee, beer, wine, pizza, crepes, cheese, sushi, and so much more!  I'm sold!  7th Street Public Market is the home of Not Just Coffee, Local Loaf Bakery, Pure Pizza, Tank's Tap, Cloud 9 Confections, Hazelnuts Creperie, Orman's Cheese Shop, Viva Raw, and then some.    This place is always busy on the weekends but offers ample seating and free WiFi.  Don't be shy; share a table!  The market hosts various events throughout the week and on weekends.  It's a great place to relax over coffee, have breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.  You'll see a wide variety of patrons; ranging from the uptown professional to the hipster coffee house lurker.  Business professionals and students alike take advantage of the \"mobile office\" concept to get some work done.  There's even a designated area to \"plugin\" if need be.  Vendors have changed out some over time, but the tried and true have stuck around.  The market has its own parking garage.  Once inside, be sure to validate your ticket to enjoy your first 90 minutes free of charge.  There's definitely a little something for everyone here.  I'd highly encourage anyone to check it out!"}
{"text":"I am frequently asked, \"Where should I take my ____________ who is visiting from out of town? I want to show them the city, but don't know where to start.\" My answer usually involves some variety of 7th Street Public Market.  a) validated parking for 90 mins (or just swing over to Queen City Q for a drink and have them validate if you're going to be there for a long time) b) incredible local food options including Local Loaf, Orrmans, Pure Pizza, Bonsai, etc. c) treats, treats, treats!! barCHOCOLATe, Cloud 9, Novel Sweets, Salts of the Earth, etc. d) drinky things from Not Just Coffee, the Sorting Table, Viva Raw...  There's so much more, including actual \"market\" type vendors. I love Saturday mornings, buzzing with activity, with additional vendors outside and kids running around everywhere. So if you're looking for a place to give someone the flavor of Charlotte as it's expanding into a more mature city, you simply must check out 7th Street Public Market."}
{"text":"The market was smaller than I had expected. I didnt get to try anything there but I was hoping for a bigger market with more variety of food and dessert. I do hope this place expands with more choices to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a local market with a great atmosphere, and great people. I typically shop at the market because I feel great after eating the food here rather than at a grocery store where almost everything is processed. The owner's are wonderful, hard at work and treating you like you are the boss, making you leave with a smile on your face. I highly recommend coming here, the only bad thing is that they are not open on sunday!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in Charlotte. I stumbled upon this place one day on a search for coffee. A lot of my great finds happen when I'm on a coffee hunt. I love that I can walk to this place from my apartment- I can't think of a better place to kill some time on a weekend. Sushi, Coffee, wine, cheese? what more can a girl ask for?? Well I guess I could go for some homemade soaps and delish pizza. This place has it all. When my roommate and I went it was pretty slow for some reason, but I'm not complaining. All the vendors we spoke with were happy and helpful. My coffee was Amazing ( I wasn't very surprised, I have had Not just Coffee before) Our sushi was fresh and filling and my dog seems to like his hamdemade soap.   Parking is validated for 90 minutes and some of the vendors have really well priced items. I'm sure I will be venturing to the public market again!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and execution of this place... there is actually something for everyone here.  If there isn't something here for you, there is always people-watching!  Do have to warn you, this place is an assault on the senses.  The moment you walk in, you smell all sorts of goodness:  coffee, beer, soaps, fresh made pastries, it's pretty crazy.  You are also hit with a wall of sound, but in a good way... that just means it is bustling with activity with folks enjoying and making use of the market.  Just like you learn something new everyday, I always discover another corner of this place that I haven't tried yet - It maybe a 'special' one of the vendors is offering or an entirely new vendor in the space.  The space really celebrates the community and the ability to get fresh foods and goods.  They even hold events here like a holiday \"sip and shop\" where you can buy Christmas presents while enjoying beverages.   Definitely a great alternative to \"big-box\" shopping, having something like this in a thriving city is such a treat.  Parking in the deck is free for the first 90min if you get validated in the market, but you can easily get to it via Light Rail (stop is right outside) or just walk from uptown... ride a bike (B-cycle station right outside)."}
{"text":"Well I got there about 3pm so everything was closing up by the time I got there but there were a few places still open.  Pure Pizza, Not Just Coffee and a few other places seemed to be busy yet.  There is also a fresh meat stand, a produce vendor and several specialty vendors.  Ended up buying just a beverage from Nelly's Naturals.   Seems like a decent place.   I'll need to come back here when the rest of the vendors are there.  And it's air conditioned unlike some other similar markets around town.  In this heat, that is a plus!"}
{"text":"7th Street Market is gem to the Uptown area. If you can't make up your mind about what you want to eat, come here and surprise your taste buds. There's a variety of little eateries here... Including pizza. I can with the intent to grab some coffee and ended up trying a crepe too!   On a nice day, you can sit outside and catch the train south when you're finish if you want. #simplelife"}
{"text":"I really appreciate that the 7th Street Public Market even exists, try to patronize the place at least once a month and it would be more often if we didn't live in Huntersville.  My favorite new addition is the Meat and Fish company which is owned by the LaVecchia's (yes, those LaVecchia's...).    They supply many restaurants in town and offer a nice, if pricey, variety of fresh seafood and grass fed beef for the retail customer.  They generally have Kobe beef too if you are into spending that kind of dough and always seem to have some interesting, unique specials.  Recent ones include whole Berkshire suckling pigs and this weekend, two versions of huge salt prawns.  Yesterday I bought two racks of St. Louis cut Berkshire pork spare ribs.  I dry rubbed and smoked them for four hours and they made a delicious dinner last night.  Again, pricey but, if you have never had any kind of \"heritage pork\", you will know why you spent that extra cash once you take the first bite.  SO much more rich flavor than what you get from a vacuum packed, mass produced rack you pick up from your local grocery."}
