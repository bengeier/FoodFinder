{"text":"My go to Chinese restaurant. Very convenient location. Food comes very quick.  Just avoid coming on their busy hours. 
Their steamed whole fish was actually good. I prefer their fried squid tentacles better than in the other congee restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge dishes. 

This place always provides great food and very quick service. Food is brought out as it's ready. 

Sizzling plates are advertised, and the tea is great."}
{"text":"Too much MSG. No \"wok hay.\" Sometimes some dishes are bland. In my family and circle of friends, I'm always against going here because its disappointing - especially knowing how real Chinese food ought to taste like! Sometimes I loose out and just grudgingly tag along. If you have"}
{"text":"We ordered hot and sour soup, Chef's special fried rice and chilli chicken. We were truly delighted with the authentic taste of the soup and rice. One of best kind honestly. The food was light on your stomach and tasted superb!! 
Glad to find Congee Star near by our place!!"}
{"text":"Very generous servings. We had five ravenous adults and could not finish the three dishes. We got a bowl of queen congee which was piping hot and had great consistency. Flavour is a ok. Fried rice average but I liked that it was not oily and they were generous with the seafood. Likewise for the crispy seafood noodles. Large variety on menu. I saw a lot of tables ordering their deep fried appetizers like chicken wings and pork chop. Looked good, will try next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good portions with the right price! Gets super busy so I prefer to do take out. They are fast, efficient, and never get my orders wrong.

The food is great as well!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try after hearing good things from my brother. I went on a Monday night at around 8pm and it was pretty quite. I was expecting a bit more from this place after my brother hyped it up but it wasn't too bad.

We ordered
Crab meat with fishmow soup - didn't enjoy the taste as it was very thick and you could taste the corn starch
Sweet and sour pork - decent portions and fried to perfection
Soft shell crab fried rice - pretty bland vs. Congee Queen's
Breaded shrimp w/ spicy salt - simple and boring but the spices went well with the rice 

Congee Star's food didn't have that authentic Chinese taste compared to the other congee joints. Overall it was a quick fix, but for comparable prices I would have rather went to Congee Queen up the street."}
{"text":"I frequented Congee Queen a myriad of times ever since I moved to Yonge and Eglinton. The only things that bothered me about Congee Queen were that the service was spotty and it was always crowded. I was elated to discover that Congee Star had better food AND better service.

The portions are generous and the prices are fair. My favourite dishes are the fish filet in sweet corn sauce and the spicy salt fried chicken wings! All the other dishes I've tried here are the same, if not better, than Congee Queen. 

The cashier lady who handles all takeout orders is incredibly friendly. She's much nicer than the stone-cold cashier at Congee Queen, who takes the 'queen' name too seriously or something."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for Congee Star as of lately. 

My fianc√© used to LOVE Congee Star, we would go almost every Friday for a take out dinner. Their BBQ pork fried rice is the best i've ever had! And the rest of their menu is pretty good too. We would always do take out, and take home big full take out containers full of their food. 

The last 3 times we got Congee Star (since they have gotten their new chef), the portions have been cut in almost HALF and the price is the SAME. We got orders of the fried rice and an order of the chicken curry. The curry container was literally half full.  They also changed the take out containers to smaller containers that are still only half full! What a rip off! That is just being cheap, and you will loose valuable take out customers! ( I don't know if the dine in portions are still the same). After the first time it happened we thought it was a fluke or mistake. After it happened two more times, we decided we will not be back, and on the hunt for a new take out restaurant. 

The food is good, but not worth the teeny portion size they give you."}
{"text":"The best place within a wide radius for Hong Kong fast food.  Great tasting food for very low prices.

Beware the weekday lunch rush!"}
{"text":"My brother and his girlfriend love this spot. 

I checked it out a few weeks back. 

If you're a non-pork consumer like me this is definitely not the place for you. 

They had a lot of pork on the menu. 

I had their steamed shrimp dumplings which were average. 

I'm definitely not a fan of oily foods - I found their fried items were excessively oily. 

The service was average. No complaints but wasn't fantastic either."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Service was ok, a bit slow.
We always order the eggplant in hotpot, vegetable fried rice, sizzling beef with mushrooms and onion. 5 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots during the week, as I work within walking distance to the restaurant. This will be a short but sweet review.

Pros:
Amazing food, fast service, clean, and very cheap

Cons:
Can be pretty busy at lunch... but I guess that's an indicator that people really love this restaurant

Recommendations:
Congee - all of them are amazing
General Tao Chicken - I'm Filipino/Canadian and you know we love GT chicken!
Fried dough stick wrapped in rice noodle
Fried oyster hot pot
Beef noodles
Salted & Spicy squid
... almost too many to mention. The list that I mentioned above all together will run you around $35 with most of the dishes well under $10."}
{"text":"this place brings part of home to the freezer box known as Toronto.  It's actually not directly in Toronto, but in a northern neighborhood.   I was there for work and went with a coworker there.  He's Bangladeshian and loves this place because of their oil stick wrapped with rice crepe.  After hearing him describe what it was I figured he probably meant Zha Lian.  We came here on my last day in Canada before I was about to head out to the airport to catch a flight to Boston.  This place was packed for lunch and more people kept pouring in during the busy lunch hour to their amazement and unhappy looks as they went back out to find another lunch spot.  well first off you judge a restaurant by its patrons and there were loads of my peoples here so that's one good marker that this place meets our congee standards.  Also for a place that has Congee in their name this place better make the best congee in the world. Turns out the congee was awesome.  This place is dirt cheap too.  Everything tasted authentic to me just like the way I get food back in LA.  Thanks to my Bangladeshian friend I now have a place I will have to ocme back to if I'm ever back to Toronto again."}
{"text":"These place has been a regular for me over the years, however something has suddenly changed. As much as I hate to give this place 3 stars I just find the food different. It's really oily and bland?! Thanks to my post-pregnancy nose my sense of smell is even stronger than before. I find the food smelling of the meats and eggs that are being used in a not so good way. And the chinese broccoli...do they always smell that way? As well I find depending on what time of the day you go the food is prepared differently. Congee Star what has happened?"}
{"text":"Adore this place. It usually takes a while to get a seat at dinner time, because, clearly, I'm not the only one with these sentiments.

The food is cheap, the service is quick (once you're seated), and best of all, it tastes great! On top of that, there's so much variety that it's definitely a place you wouldn't get bored of visiting again and again.

Worth the trip, even if it's out of your way."}
{"text":"Our regular Congee-chain since we moved to the area. We typically order spicy pork chops, turnip patties, fish maw with crab meat soup, congee with pork and preserved egg, and some kind of noodle dish.

They can accommodate large groups too as we had two large tables together."}
{"text":"First time coming to this congee location and they definitely exceeded my expectations. The service was great! The staff had proper manners, good timing, and our food were served quite fast yet everything was cooked well! My favourite dish that we ordered was the roasted duck; well-cooked and tasted so yummy! I also really enjoy their sizzling dishes, especially the sizzling beef with ginger and green onions.

Exceptional experience here on any day or night and whatever the occasion may be. 
Definitely coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I wanted to order for the Easter Weekend, we made out pics based on the menu on the website.  But when we called, they told us that their prices had went up for their party trays which is fine, but they did not honour the prices they had up on the website.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"One of the best congee restaurants, I would say even better than the popular ones like Congee Wong and Congee Queen. This place is spacious, unlike other restaurants which can be crossed and uncomfortable to dine in. Food is good, flavorful but not too salty. Service is good too, the servers speak English (not very fluently but good enough) without making you feel weird if you don't speak Chinese. This become my favorite place to go for some congee and Chinese food."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is fantastic and service is fast.   Who cares about friendly lol we just wanna eat good food.    Lots of parking all the time."}
{"text":"Ample parking and no line ups make this place attractive to me. Still relatively unknown so they aim to please

I'm pretty harsh on my Chinese restos but I must say this one delivers. 

The eggplant and bamboo shoots is very tasty and the pancakes are very delicious. 

The sticky rice with shredded pork is a great appetizer and the snow pea leaves are fresh and green

If carbs are your thing the fried noodles and pan fried noodles dishes are big. 

Lots of spicy offerings too"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that i ate at this wonderful restaurant the first week that it opened. 

One of the owners named Eddie served my business partner and i and the food blew us both away. Within a few short months there was a line up just to get a table. The sounds and smells that permeated in the air told you why one had to wait in line ... but so worth it.

I've been eating here for close to 10 years so i know what i'm talking about in regards to the food and experience ... i moved away from the area and haven't been here for a while and last night i took my family for what was sure to be a great treat.

When i arrived on a Friday night i didn't see the usual long line, as i was expecting to wait in line as usual for a table ... it was 3/4 empty ... i didn't sense the usual smell in the air of that great food being cooked from the kitchen ... i didn't recognize any of the staff at all ... Eddie one of the owners wasn't there and the staff didn't even know who i was talking about when i asked about him.

Due to this i told my family that i was worried that the food experience wasn't going to be good ... since i didn't see the usual packed place with customers waiting in line ... instead i saw a 3/4 empty restaurant and this told me something terrible had happened and that's why there was no crowd.

The servers didn't know the menu enough to answer questions as to the differences of the dishes and when the food arrived i was floored. 

It is no longer the Congee Star i knew and loved ... it was TERRIBLE!!! ... 

I now mourn the passing of one of the great spots to eat and my whole family is saddened by it. We all loved this place so much. 

I also miss Eddie and his smile and passion for his food and service... i only hope he opened another restaurant and if so i pray i can find it

Eddie you were the best and my Family and i thank you for giving us 10 years of amazing food and the joy of eating at your special restaurant what an experience, we will never forget you.

In the spirit of this and from my heart, i employ to all of you to ... STAY AWAY!!! ...  from this restaurant ... don't waste your precious time and money. 

By how empty the restaurant has become ... so do thousands of other regular patrons agree with me.

Congee Star ... R.I.P."}
{"text":"Portions are huge. The fried rice has yellow food colouring which I don't like. They don't have much competition since there really isn't anything similar nearby except for Congee queen."}
{"text":"Quite a nice restaurant for the family. I come here often to get some dine-in Chinese food. I love ordering the egg fried rice, salty and spicy squid (highly recommend this; I like to put chilli oil on it too), Cantonese chow mein (crispy, yet saucy, and garlic fried chicken (very crispy). Restaurant is pretty small, so get here early on weekend dinners and holidays or make a reservation if they allow. Overall, it's a pretty good place."}
{"text":"- legit Chinese joint in a very odd neighborhood.
- am consistently surprised to see this place full of chinese folks - which confirms the legit-ness
- their house congee (salmon, shrimp. surf clam, grouper, and other seafood) is a steal at 5.95 for a bowl that can serve at least 2 people."}
{"text":"This is a busy, authentic congee restaurant.  Special mixed seafood congee (regular size) was enough for two, full of fresh -not frozen- fish (white fish and salmon) plus scallops, shrimps and squid.  Absolutely delicious with just the right amount of ginger shreds to accentuate the freshness of the seafood.  A side dish of barbeque pork was plump and tasty, but it was a little soggy (no crisp edges) due to accompanying broth.  Unfortunately service was perfunctory and getting the waiter's attention required constant struggle.  Nonetheless the congee is worth the effort.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after a few beers at the Don Mills Bier Market. The restaurant is located in a strip mall off of Don Mills with lot's of parking (but near full at dinner time).

The restaurant was large with lot's of seating and is very clean. Service was great and very quick. Portions were huge and priced fairly at about $7 - $10 per dish.

We ordered five dishes to share (obviously I'm not using the official chinese names):

1)  Deep fried fish with cream corn - a favourite of mine. This was a good version but probably could have used a bit more cream corn given the large portion of rice.

2) Rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce - very good, not dry and the perfect ratio of veggies to noodles.

3) A new Chinese vegetable dish I never had before, kind of looked like green beans but harder like broccoli - so good and my new fav. chinese veggie dish.

4) Beef short-ribs with pepper & Garlic served on a hot plate - this was the only poor dish tonight, the meat was very tough and lacking significant flavour.

5) Sweet Eggplant - Amazing, one of the better eggplant dishes I tried and not oily like most.

I will be back when I'm in the area again. Fast service, good food and cheap prices - the perfect trifecta.

{"text":"Congee Queen was closed!  Booo...

As a backup plan, I headed over to Congee Star for take-out.  Meh.

I ordered the rice noodles with beef, onions, and bean sprouts.  The noodles were all broken up.  The flavour was alright but who likes to eat short little bits of rice noodles?

I also ordered the seafood and wintermelon congee.  This was okay in terms of ingredients, but it was bland.  Me calling something bland is not a good thing.  

Lastly (which was the biggest disappointment of the night) was the yin yang rice dish.  This consists of egg fried rice half topped with chicken in a sweet and sour sauce and the other half a white, creamy sauce with shrimp. The ratio of chicken and shrimp to the amount of sauces was quite pathetic.  It was like 95% sauce and 5% proteins.  Sad.  

I liked that all the sauces were put into separate containers for take-out.  I think this is the norm.  The service was pretty good too, not the usual curtness at Asian restaurants.  It's too bad, if only the food was better."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for dinner, lunch and take out.  This place is in a decent location and there is always parking available unlike most places in Richmond Hill and Markam.  There are always plenty of seats available and the servers will get your started quickly.

The decor is that of most typical Chinese restaurant or Cafes and it's nothing out of the ordinary.  The staff are fairly quick to serve you and your food comes out fast and furious.  The food is usually pretty good and always comes out hot and made to order.  I usually order the fried turnip cake, various dim sum dishes, e fu noodles with lobster and sea food congee.  Portions are pretty huge here, so be ready to take home a ton of left overs for lunch the next day.  Food is pretty flavourful and on par with places like Congee Queen and Congee Wong in my opinion.

If you're hungry and looking for Chinese food in the Don Mills area this is a good place to start.  Their all day dim sum options are also good for those who are too far from Richmond Hill and Markam, but still want to get their dim sum fix on.  I'll be back here next time I have that craving for spicy minced pork and egg plant!"}
{"text":"Cheap, cheerful, delicious Chinese food.  The portions are huge and when you're in a carbo-loading mood, this place definitely hits the spot!  Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for lunch! Their service is fast and they have a good variety of congee. Its not the best place if you're craving congee in my opinion, but it still touches the spot. 

The selections are really good and super filling. If you're not sharing I recommend you get it without the noodles, since with the noodles it'd become extremely filling. The beef ones I recommend compared to the other flavours. 

The service is ridiculously fast. We came as a group of 6 at a busy lunch hour and got our food within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"We come here regularly. It's good, it's cheap, it's reasonably fast and it's filling.  Although we do have a regular set of dishes we order, almost everything we've had here was at least good and much of it above average.  You can pretty much pick things randomly off the menu and be pleasantly surprised with most of it. Nothing here is totally exceptional, IMO, but the quality's good and the prices are reasonable.

They get busy at lunch, but they've never been too busy to seat us quickly, and the service is usually decent.

They're located in a strip mall with a Harvey's, Swiss Chalet, Mongolian Grill, Memories of Japan, Sorrento, Tilley's, Skiis & Biikes, etc. It's not terribly obvious from the street where they are, but they're my favorite restaurant in this mall.

I don't recommend the fried oysters or the oyster patties, both of which sounded better than they actually were. The green beans with fish were a little burned in taste the one time I tried 'em.

They do have TVs, but they're used only for advertisements of their menu items, so I answered \"No\" to \"Has TV\" below."}
{"text":"...while i've always known this place existed, it's hard for me to remember that it's there to try it out. located in a plaza on don mills but you can't really see the storefront and if you're not looking for it you'll drive by it completely. finally we got dinner takeout as we were searching on yelp. 

we ordered:
live whole lobster with efu noodles - excellent. 
yeung chow fried rice - good, but the peas were slightly undercooked. 
sweet cruller rice noodle rolls, good. 
stir fried beef with vegetables, good. 
deep fried squid tentacles, good. 
fried turnip patties Singapore style, mediocre. 
sweet and sour pork, excellent. 

the food was great, the prices are definitely cheaper than congee queen. all of that for $70, and they deliver for orders over $25 - which i didn't know until we picked up the food. love delivery, especially for the winter - will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I were hungry as hell when we hit this place. We had the Cantonese chow mein and spicy eggplant. The food was fine, nothing revolutionary. The chow mein was crispy upon first viewing but got soggy pretty much right away.

The only thing I could think was how I usually only get Chinese food of this calibre at the end of a looong night."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Scarborough. It's waaaaay better than Congee Queen/Wong. Their food is always consistent. I eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Went at noon on a Sunday and the place was not busy so we were seated right away. 

Ordered 3 items from the menu:

- Lean Pork with preserved Egg/Salty Egg Congee (Small)
- Deep fried Dough
- Rice noodles with beef and black bean sauce

Food came out in under 10 minutes and everything was hot and tasted pretty good. The congee was thick and not watery, the rice noodles had the wok flame taste and the fried dough was hot and crispy. Some of the beef was more chewy than the rest but overall the dish was good.

Total came up to $16.39 which is really cheap! Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"There are quite a few Chinese Restaurants in this area. However, Congee Star truly shines bright in this neighbourhood! (see what I did there? haha) anyways... I was \"wishing\" for a great place that opened late, tasted good, decent in price, and provided decent service.... congee star possesses all of these qualities and more.

I have eaten in and ordered take out and both experiences were fantastic! I have ordered sweet and sour chicken, beef with mixed veggies, salt n pepper squid, ho fun, and chicken wings and fried rice and it was all cooked to perfection!

I have cut down on my msg intake lately but I can simply not resist congee stars delicious food! They are always consistent and the price is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I really like this spot for congee and HK fast food.  The food is clean and tasty.  Cheap prices, and friendly staff.  

There's booths along the wall, or round tables for large groups."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner with a few of my friends, as we had been to the place before a couple of times and had decent experiences in the past. It's just standard Chinese food, just a safe choice and usually made because we're too hungry or unable to drive anywhere else. No complaints in the past though. 

This time, we decided to not dine family style and ordered individually. I had the BBQ pork noodle soup, which came out quickly and was good. It could have been hotter, but  tasted nice and had a good amount of pork and noodle. Two of my friends chose to order General Tso chicken on fried rice. The two orders came out relatively quickly and they enjoyed their meals, although commenting that the sauce was a bit too sweet in comparison with other General Tso chicken they've had. The waitress was friendly and even humoured my friend when he made a lame joke about working there since he wore a shirt that matched the orange of the servers'. 

The trouble came when my other friend decided he wanted some chicken pad thai. He had waited to order, as he was not sure if he wanted to indulge, and did so as we were halfway through our meals. Again, the food came out quickly. It smelled terrible. We're used to the smell of pad thai, but this smelled like something was spoiled. Upon tasting it, my friend spat it out into a napkin. We called the waiter over and asked if maybe we can order something else in it's stead. He went to bring over the manager. 

This guy walked over looking displeased and asked bluntly what the problem was. My friend didn't want to seem rude and say he thought the food was spoiled, so he said that \"it was not what I expected to get when I ordered it\" and again asked if he could perhaps get something else. What came next was probably the worst manager interaction I've ever experienced. He got rude with us and started saying \"so? You ordered pad thai, this is our pad thai. What were you expecting? So what do you want me to do about this NOW?\" He even went so far as to say, \"what? Should I have to eat it instead?\" The whole time my friend felt extremely uncomfortable under this barrage of questioning, and after the interrogation, he just mumbled that he didn't need anything else. The manager then told us that if we didn't need anything else, that he would get our bill and asked if we were paying by card, basically ushering us out. When we responded that we did, he said \"follow me\" and walked away to the register. As we gathered our things and was deciding who was picking up the bill, he came back and condescendingly told us that we had to follow him to pay, like we were wasting his sweet time when he had been gone for all about 20 seconds. I followed him up to the register, and throughout the entire transaction, had to listen to him justify the fact that he was upset because now he had to throw the food out. In a small bit of redemption, they didn't charge us for the pad thai and we left quickly. 

Good servers, standard food (stay away from the pad thai though), but TERRIBLE management. Will not be spending our money here anymore because of the last point, opting for any other generic Chinese food place in the area, even if it's a bit of a drive away."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special Singapore vermicelli noodles with a bunch of coworkers and we all got the same thing. It also came with a nice soup, believe it had chicken and corn. And a spring roll was added too. The price was extremely cheap for the amount of food given. The noodles had a really good taste and a nice kick of heat to it. If you are in the area and are in need of something for lunch, call ahead and do some take out!"}
{"text":"Congee Time, Congee Queen, Congee Wong...you name it all but this Congee Star is truly my fave out of all of them. Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch for an asian restaurant. Usually when you go to a Chinese restaurant you find semi-rude to rude servers trying to get you in and out quickly. The service is always efficient and the waiters are friendly even when you order takeout. I have been to the Congee Queen location just at The Shops but it was far more crowded and the prices were more expensive. The dishes that are a must try here are the hot n sour soup, Cantonese chow mein, and the special fried rice. They are all delicious! We even did a catering order for a party and the party trays are affordable ...perfect for a large group. Overall, my go-to Chinese resto especially because its so close to my area!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre here. This was our second time here since we enjoyed it the last time. Not sure why the food quality wasn't as good. For example, the short ribs barely had meat on them. The vegetables were very under seasoned. Seafood was just okay. I'm giving this a two star mainly because the service was not good. Food came out quickly but it took 4 times of asking to get our water and 5 tries to get our tea. They kept forgetting and honestly the place was not that full because it was a later lunch hour. It took a while for us to even get our order taken. No one was rude per say, but they just weren't well organized. Not coming back here. There's better places that serve the same thing. Prices were average."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Chinese Mcdonald type of food. 

Quick service. Inexpensive.  Great chinese food depends on who you talk to but decent.

Would prefer this over Mcdonald and for a family of 4 it's actually cheaper and probably healthier. 

Good for peanut allergies as both my kids have it but have to inform the servers. Sunday come before 11:30 am as the church crowd comes in after that and you will then have to wait for seats."}
{"text":"I recently went to Congee Star for the first time and had a positive experience.

1) The food is very reasonably priced. The portions are large and the quality was not compromised by the quantity. 

2) The menu has SO much variety. This is a great place for meat eaters, seafood lovers and vegetarians alike. They also had a TON of items that are lighter, grilled, steamed and not fried. It is easy to create a balanced, filling meal that is not too unhealthy. 

3) Getting a table took a bit of time and the front end of the restaurant was a bit chaotic. To get to the hostess to write down our names was a bit of challenge and confusing.

4) The service was great. A dish we did not order was accidentally brought to us. We didn't realize it was not what we ordered (it was similar to something we did order just a different kind of dumpling). We ate it unknowingly. Someone came by a little too late to swap the incorrect order but it was too late. They were SO nice about it. They didn't charge us for the extra order - in fact they didn't even bring it up! Very good service. 

5) For being so busy, they were very quick in turning over tables and bringing food promptly. 

6) We ordered 5 dishes. Everything we ordered was delicious. I highly recommend the whole steamed Tilapia and the green onion, mushroom wontons. The crab meat soup was also very delicious!

I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Good eats for cheap.  Their fried rice is really good and I especially enjoy the Yeung Chow fried rice that comes with a variety of meats and vegetables.  For $8, the portion size gets me through about 3 meals.  The menu is large and they have a whole page dedicated to fried rice and rice dishes.  I'm pretty sure I can eat here every day if I lived nearby.  The service was fast and friendly.  They seated us right away and brought hot tea to the table.  They have both booths and tables if you want to dine in.

The strip mall is under construction at the moment, but they are still open for business.  It's nice that they are opened until midnight every night!  The parking lot is huge and parking is easy.  They are in the same strip mall as Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill and Swiss Chalet Rotisserie, just keep driving around until you see a yellow sign."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!! If you are looking for the worst Chinese food in town, go here!!
poor service, bad food and dirty!!"}
{"text":"This place is close enough to my work that I wanted to like it. I even wanted to give this place 3 stars, but after further discussions with my fellow diners, I've be swayed into the 2 star ranking.

We went during lunch, had a reservation and all was well so far.
Menu looked good with lots of options at good prices. We settled on a few things including General Tao Chicken on Rice, Beef and Udon Noodle, Soy Sauce Chow Mein, Deep Fried Oysters, and Spring Rolls.

Nothing impressive came to the table. The General Tao was way too sweet and not enough spice and was just chicken and rice, no vegetables. The spring roll was super bland. I was told that the batter on the deep friend oysters was terrible. The beef udon noodle meal took half an hour to come out as well which on a lunch when you've only got 45 minutes to eat, is pretty brutal. Later in the afternoon 2 of the dining counterparts also reported feeling a bit off after as well.

Overall, it was lunch, but not a good one and not one I'd see myself coming back to try again given that no one was actually impressed in the slightest with something they ordered."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a half a star or no stars I certainly would. First off we sat ourselves....then waited for a long time to be waited on even though there was only one other family in the place. The dishware was stained, cracked and so worn and used that the enamel was wearing thin. The tea pot the brought was cracked and the water so hot the handle nearly burnt my hand.  Now...onto the food....bland doesn't even describe it properly. My husband ordered shrimp with rice....the shrimp were boiled and thrown into bland yellow rice with shriveled peas. The mixed vegetable dish I had had lumps of cornstarch that hadn't cooked properly. Half my daughter's noodles were raw and crunchy in her dish. My other daughter lucked out with the fried turnip dish which was actually passable. We had to ask for the bill and not once were we asked if we needed any thing else. Boo. Terrible place. Stay away."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food but you need someone with you that knows what to order.  The menus are confusing and all look the same.  Huge portions and very reasonable priced.  You will be full and you will have a take home bag.  Come as a group to help eat all the food you will order."}
{"text":"We used to come here for years and it's been a few months since out last visit. Definitely there has been a complete turnover in ownership/management/staff.

First on order was a chow mein. Crispy egg noodle was specifically requested. Twice. What came (really quickly) was a platter of boiled noodle with a saucy topping. When I mentioned the crispy noodle the server looked puzzled and stated that's not done with egg noodle. He took the plate and returned with fried noodle, but without any crispiness or browned crunchiness.

General Tao Chicken is a dish that varies from place to place but it was the worst I've had anywhere. Ordered with sauce on the side, what turned up was essentially soggy chicken nuggets with a bowl of...sweet and sour sauce. No zip of any other flavour. At this point I couldn't deal with the hassle and settled on what was in front of me.

The third dish was double-cooked green bean stir-fried with pork. There was none of the snap to the beans from the benefit of a really hot wok. Just the yielding softness of over-cooking. And saltiness, on top of the dried fish in the recipe.

We ate just enough and it was time to pay. The wait staff was all walking around attentively enough, but couldn't be sure what they were looking out for. There was one staff whose job looked like it was to take payments but just sat there by the cash register staring off. I like the modest size of the restaurant, and the place was nowhere full at the time and there was no lineup to get in as we've experienced so many times before. Even then, the wait for the bill might have taken ten minutes...

Ended throwing out the take-home leftovers.

Congee Queen from now on."}
{"text":"Used to eat here regularly but since the new management, the restaurant has become so dirty it's disgusting. It's FILTHY. In fact it was in a local Chinese newspaper as the dirtiest Chinese restaurant in the city. The food quality and value is still there but the dining experience is a turn off. Will not be returning until they clean up, but I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"My first Congee place experience. GOODBYE CONGEEGINITY!!!!! I will not miss thee.  The location is big and it was pretty busy around lunch time on a Wednesday. Lunch specials for $7.50 and you get soup and spring rrrrooolllll = yummy. 

We had the deep fried tentacles, some kind of rice with mushrooms, chicken and bok choi (one of those green things that people steam?) and it came in a hot bowl so that the rice at the botton was sticky and crunchy at the same time :D Also had the vermicelli that's part of the special, congee with surf clam, choy sum with oyster sauce, hot and sour soup, my friend has the cheung fun and rice roll with duck in it, and rice cake with cabbage and some pork.

Rice roll - amazing. would have a thousand of these, it was so gooey and delicious!
Rice with mushrooms - no. i don't like this. i don't really like rice that much and the chicken was bland. 
Squid tentacles - i want to marry these tentacles. I want to make sweet love to them and have baby tentacles. THAT good.
Vermicelli - dry and meh. wouldn't order it again. 
Rice cake - no. i don't like rice cake. this wasn't Korean style when it's sliced fat and juicy, this was more like rice cake medallions?
Hot and sour soup - yes, i love this stuff.
Spring roll - standard, pretty big.
Choy sum - yummy! soft and i love the oyster sauce on errytang.

Keep in mind that I had to ask one of my trusty rice minions to spell all those names for me....


Service sucked a**. They never came around and it took us like 20 min to get the bill after we asked for it. The portions are BIG, just the way I like it, and the bill was pretty decent - I think for all that between 5 people we paid around $65. I'm pretty much taking away that star for service, and the fact that i didn't enjoy the rice dishes or the vermicelli. NOT SPECIAL ENOUGH!

But I would most definitely come back here again for lunch if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that sells good food for cheap, this is the place to go. My family frequently comes here for lunch and sometimes dinner. This place is sometimes a hit or miss but because it's so cheap, most of the time you won't mind.

On some days the food is really tasty and on others it isn't as tasty. This goes the same for the service at this restaurant. There are a few of the servers who I really like and some are just meh. Some of the servers are extremely rude and just stare at you blankly when you make a request for something. But thank goodness that it doesn't happen all the time or I would never ever go back!

Overall, this restaurant is your standard Chinese restaurant--fully equipped with the usual pearly white utensils and chopsticks--and the prices are cheap and affordable! You can easily feed a family of four for just under $20. Order a giant bowl of congee with an order of the Yao Jah Gwai (Chinese doughnuts) and you're good to go.

Of course ordering just congee and those Chinese doughnuts would be boring, so you definitely have to try ordering their delicious turnip cake dish and as well as choosing something from their sizzling plate section. I highly recommend the beef with mushroom sizzling plate!"}
{"text":"Very surprised at all the 4 & 5 star reviews here. The food here is mediocre at best. I didn't order but we had the General Tao Chicken, black pepper sizzling beef and some noodle dish with pork and shrimps. The General Tao was one of the worst I've ever had. Smothered in some gross very very sweet sauce. The beef was OK nothing special also sweet for some reason. The noodles were also pretty boring overall. 

We had ordered sauteed garlic shoots but they brought us the wrong dish and we sent it back. By the time they brought the garlic shoots we had finished all the other food. Also ordered a sizzling shrimp with ginger and green onion which was the best dish of all. Still the sauce was very very thick and full of corn starch it seemed. 

You're better off going to Congee Queen for much better food. Also the portion size here is small. The only positive is that the service was good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this place for a couple of years now. One of the best things about this place is the value. Even though some of the food is on an average quality level I feel that the food here is very reasonably priced and is cheaper than a lot of other congee restaurants. The staff seem welcoming and the customer service also seems to be better compared to other congee restaurants. Overall this place definitely gives you your money's worth."}
{"text":"Above average Chinese Restaurant. Large and spacious. Nice staff. Good portions. I'd go back again."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. My parents really like this restaurant and we have been coming for many years. Let's dive right into the review.

The quality of the food used to be pretty decent. But over the years, the quality of their food has gone down. I can only give them an average score as of now. 

Things here are very well priced. I guess the quality of the food is offset by the sheer amount you get per dollar here. No wonder my parents love this place so much.

I don't have much to say about its service. It doesn't wow me or enrage me so yet another average score.

Overall this quality of this restaurant defines the meaning of mediocre. The only true win is the value you get if you don't mind average tasting food. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place is rated so high.. But I'm giving it 2.5... For food and cleanness.. 

I came here on Tuesday for quick dinner, and when we were place at the table, the supposed-to-be already cleaned plates with small ceramic bowl on top seem to have dried out veggie leaves on it.. B'cause we were in rush and didn't want ruin our mood, so I decided to clean it myself.. Using the tea water.. 

We ordered a congee and a house made curry chicken.. When the dishes arrive.. I'm speechless again.. both of the plate and congee bowl have multiple cracks on the side.. And there I was .. Sitting and thinking.. Are they this poor? To the extend that they have to serve with these kind of dinnerwares??

And the curry chicken.. Okay... Sauce was really watery.. I almost thought it's chicken curry soup.. And what's in it?? Just chicken and potato... Ummm... Do I need to mention more?.. 

Price-wise.. They are charging the same as other congee restaurants .. But quality-wise, they just can't compete... 

Return again?? No..."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday for lunch.  They offer lunch specials on weekdays from 11:30am-3:00pm for $8.49.  It comes with soup (veggie hot & sour or chicken corn soup) and springroll.  I chose the chicken corn soup and I loved it.  Warm and delicious soup for a cold day.  I ordered the rice noodles with beef (I asked for without beansprouts).  This dish was pretty good, however, tasted too oily the more I eat it.  My friend ordered the curry beef brisket on rice.  They gave us large amount of beef and I liked how it had a lot of beggies.  The food came in huge portion size and I wasn't able to finish my food."}
{"text":"If you know what to expect at most Chinese restaurants you will be happy this place fits the fold for cheap and sizeable portions.

It's one of the better places for Chinese food in the Don Mills area."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I bring my cousins here sometimes because she absolutely drools over this place.  The restaurant is nice (and not dirty), the service is fast, they open late, the food is great and the price is right.
Making this a quick review, I love their seafood congee, beef fun noodles, ying yang fried rice (which is called fried rice with cream shrimp and sweet and sour chicken sauce... I think), and fried turnips.  I've never tasted a bad dish from this place.  They even have bubble tea (it's not on their menu but they have the non-flavoured ones).
This place is so good that I drive 15-20 minutes just to go eat there... sometimes longer because I'm lousy at directions and get lost."}
{"text":"Went there on a friday night for something quick and cheap. Surprisingly only a couple tables were seated at around 700pm. Immediately struck us as being odd as the place is usually busy. 

When we got our tea it was like slightly brownish water with no taste whatsoever. Might as well have been hot water as there were but 5 or 6 tea leaves in the pot. I challenge you to count the individual tea leaves in a pot at a Chinese resto. If you can even attempt that task it's not saying much for the quality of food you're getting because they don't even want to spend a few pennies to give you proper tea. 

So we asked (in English)!and we got some kind of garbled explanation in Mandarin. We are Chinese but Cantonese speaking. Still we asked in English you should respond in the language you are asked, anything else is just rude or lazy. 

Not sure what happened here this place was a regular spot for us. Is there new ownership/management? 

We walked out because we have choices. Will not return until I hear things have turned around (or until a new resto opens in this location)."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: decent food, fast service, a little expensive compared to similar restaurants uptown

From an Asian standpoint, this is your typical  chinese diner joint; your mindset is to get some comfort food, have it fast and have it hot.  Some of the staples are the congee, the noodles and rice and usually a side order.

Our orders:
- Singapore stir fry turnip cake
This is a twist to the traditional version which you usually get during dim sum or street food.  In addition to just steamed (to actually cook the turnip cake), a southern Asian way is to flash fry with peppers, garlic and little bits of pork meat.  The result, you still get a mushy turnip texture in the middle but you get a browned little crispy exterior - it's like the Chinese version of tater tots.
-  Sweet and Sour (Xiamen/Amoy) vermicelli
A Chinese staple, this dish is one of the many variations to making vermicelli epic.  Xiamen is a southwest costal city so you're definitely expecting some type of seafood component in there.  We chinese love chicken/pork so expect that in there too.  Some of the vegetable content includes green onions, garlic and preserved cabbage (taste like a mild flavored sauerkraut).  This is all cooked in a high flame wok with soy sauce and sugar(that's the unique part of this dish) with of course vermicelli.  A good Amoy vermicelli should be 1) well distributed sweetness 2) savory ingredients 3) I like my vermicelli not too dry aka have some sauce to coat the noodles 4) piping hot

IMO:
-  food was hot.  Can't say how important it is for this stuff to be hot at the table.  It's like eating cold pizza if it's not hot-ugh
-  + on the turnip cake.  They didn't overpower it with peppers, did not taste burntness, well prepared
- vermicelli was average.  I liked that it was hot (yes, I know I said it already), noodles were a little dry but the sweetness of the preserves cabbage saved it a little bit
-  place was clean, service was fast (I went around 5:30-6)
-  probably it was midtown, prices were jacked up 1-2 dollars compared to uptown.
-  overall, you're going to a diner and this place delivered what a Chinese diner needs to be."}
{"text":"This place used to be great.  Great food (quantity and quality), great service and staff.  It has since deteriorated over the past year.  Sizes are a lot smaller, the food doesn't taste as great either.  When we have been ordering in, the quantity has decreased in size greatly....What's more is that when we ordered Cantonese chow mein the noodles were soaked in oil, as was the fried rice. Very disappointing.  We have been customers for years but have been turned off over this and probably will have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"one order, food is not fresh (chicken & duck). second order, black bean souce pork is chewey & bit raw.
If u planning to go here, might as well go to congee queen than here."}
{"text":"Everything is always made up to expectations. Congee Star is the way to go. 

- preserved egg & pork congee +++++ 
- shrimp rice noodle rolls ++++
- I've tried many many dishes from here but those i can't ask for better 

Although it looks deceiving and that you may think congee queen or whatnot is probably better. I don't think so. 

I recommended congee star for the good food and good service."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Tried calling in an order to be happy placed on hold listening to the staff chat for 5 mins. Will not order from here again!"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is pretty average quality food. Service is also meh. For some reason (we were there at 9 pm on a Saturday) the food took a really long time even though the restaurant was more than half empty."}
{"text":"Really, I was not trying to be cheap!

I came here with good intentions since Congee Star has 4 Star rating and it is close by  Shops at Don Mills and we were all hungry.......

There is a good selections in the menu and the price point here is really good. Portion is huge but most of the dishes we ordered were meh to bad...

Officially now I had the worse ever Beef Short Ribs in Honey Pepper Sauce ($10.95) here. The ribs were chewy, tasteless, rubbery and dry. The sauce was bland and tasteless too....

Rice Noodle with Beef and Black Bean Sauce ($7.95) has the same rubbery beef, tons of noodles but not enough sauce.

Eggplant & Minced Pork Spicy Sauce in Hot Pot ($8.75) was overly sweet with no spiciness or the \"fish fragrance\"

Garlic Shoots with Garlic ($8.75) was a little oily but was the best dish of the evening.

Service was excellent and friendly but sadly the food was not up to par.

I just hope my Yelp friends were drunk enough and would have eaten anything."}
{"text":"I've been going to Congee Star for a few years now. Either to dine in or take out. The food is good, the price is not the best I've seen. But the service is poor. The servers are rude and just don't care about anything.

After taking out food, I realized at home that my order was wrong. I called in and they wanted me to go back and pay for the difference of what I was supposed to get. I asked for at least to be delivered, they said no. I asked for a discount, they said no. They gave me no option and made me pay for their mistake. They weren't friendly, gave me no option or at least an advantage. We decide to drive back, return the entire order and get our money back. They were ok with it. No apologies. No trying to fix the issue. Zero care.

I'm done with that place."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their food. We always get takeout from this place. The portions are always massive and delicious. Reasonably priced. I want to try the whole menu and I am looking forward to eating in the restaurant soon."}
{"text":"I was dropping off my snowboard at the nearby Skiis and Biikes (a bad experience, see my other review) and decided to go here for lunch.

I had a regular sized bowl of congee with shredded pork and preserved egg and an order of the fried bread fritters. It was tasty and the portion was huge as I had half of it packed to go. Best of all, the bill came to $8. A really cheap and satisfying lunch with leftovers to enjoy later.

The service was a little slow and not very attentive, which is only fault I found."}
{"text":"i come here far too often...  to be honest im getting sick of it a little.  

but the food is not bad..this is the closest you will get to cantonese cuisine downtown  (excluding spadina) ... congee queen is more north so its really the best you got if you live within this area... 

fried turnip cake is good... congee not bad.  expect left overs when you come here as the serving size is generous."}
{"text":"I'm use to ordering take out from Congee Star, but after today, no more!

The congee was water with a little bit of rice in it. So, gross!

And the other dish I ordered, beef tendons, I received less than half a portion. And it's not like tendons are an expensive delicacy. This wasn't the first time it happened either. I always call it in, to let them know. This was the last time.
I am done with this place.

Besides the fact that they're stingy with the tendons :) messing up a plain congee is like messing up a glass of cold water. Congee is essentially rice porridge. In my opinion, if you can't cook rice in water, you should probably not be depended on to prepare food for other people."}
{"text":"2.5 stars
I'm not too sure why this place has this high of a rating. I understand the food is cheap, but it really is no different or better than Congee Queen, Congee Wong, or any other congee place. The one thing this place has that those two lack is no wait times. Which is why I came here to begin with. I decided to give this place a chance after going to Congee Queen and finding out that it would 30 min wait till I could have lunch. So I thank Congee Star for giving me a place to eat without waiting, but for it to have a high rating on yelp I find it ridiculous. However everybody is entitled to their own opinion."}
