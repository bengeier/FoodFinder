{"text":"We discovered this place just recently and were excited to try it out. So happy we did -- enjoyed all three dishes so much:  roasted beet risotto, spring halibut, and Korean braised beef. I like that the ingredients are organic, locally sourced, and that I had plenty of options that met my dietary restrictions of no dairy or wheat.  Having it all fresh and affordable is awesome. I also picked up a large jar of glutenfree BBQ sauce - another hard to find item. This is a new \"fast food\" option for us that's miles above typical grab & go fare."}
{"text":"We actually visited the Garrison Woods / Marda Loop location but it doesn't show in Yelp.   Wow! Supremely disappointing. Portions were small, vegetables (which were uber hyped in the description!) were almost non existent, meals (bourbon glazed chicken, spinach & feta stuffed chicken, braised beef risotto) overall were bland. Value for money in the negative.   There are too many places to buy actual delicious and healthy food in the city that we won't be shopping here again."}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive and the portions are very small. The salad had one cherry tomato. One! The soup was very bland. The portions of protein also leave something to be desired. I like the concept of healthy food that is locally sourced, but the price to accommodate a dinner for two is simply not economical.   I was told that the reason their food costs more than other similar take out places is due to the locally sourced vegetables and protein. As someone who has no problem spending a little more money on food if it helps to support the local farmers, ranchers, and growers (and I regularly do so) I will acknowledge that the food often costs more than the grocery store. However, it does not cost what Made Foods is suggesting. The meal I could make at the market for the price of this dinner would be huge, flavourful, and most satisfying.   Why would I bring this home and dirty my own dishes when I could go out to a restaurant that also locally sources their food? My husband and I would much rather leave a restaurant satisfied with the portions and flavours while spending the same amount than take this home and have to deal with the containers and dishes (not that washing cutlery or the pot to heat the soup is a big deal, but in relation to a full dining experience neither of us can justify this place) and still be unsatisfied with the flavours and portions. Or, we'll just stick to shopping at the markets and locals around the city and make a glorious feast for ourselves.   One star for the concept. Another star for pulling together food that is healthy."}
{"text":"We have picked up food from Made Foods on a few occasions.  I like supporting local business - Made Foods is from Calgary! I also like eating locally sourced food so this is a good option for us.  The food was always good and fresh. I like having the option of controlling the amount of dressing/sauce which I could do with certain dishes (dressing/sauce comes in a small container).  I need to order from them a few more times to form an opinion. As of yet, no concerns.   I would order from them again."}
{"text":"I'm home with a broken leg for awhile and iv ordered from there's guys a few times now so that I can keep eating half healthy while I'm off my feet. The meals are not bad. Some are lacking flavor. My biggest issue is that I absolutely hate goat cheese and for whatever reason half the meals on the menu have goat cheese. I spoke with them about this and I was told that they have received the same feedback from multiple people and are changing the menu in the fall. Bad timing for me I guess. I suggested that because the meals are made fresh and not frozen, being able to alter the meal online before ordering would be nice."}
{"text":"I have had Made foods a couple times here and there but never been to one of the Made locations. If you are not familiar with them they do prepared meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks) that are fresh and healthy options.   I ventured into Made Foods in Crowfoot and they had some great selections and some items for me to buy and try out. I purchased turkey chili for lunch and then also purchased the Korean braised beef to take home to have another time. Both items were good and I would purchase them again.  Pricing is a bit more than your average to go lunch however I feel it's worth it. You are getting something healthy and fresh which works great for me since I'm always on the go.  If you are comparing price wise, it would be more than fast food but less than a sit down meal in a restaurant.  Great concept. I will be back again to try other items and will also pick something up for my family to try for a dinner option as well."}
{"text":"Have I been arrested for a crime that I didn't commit? I mean why am I being subjected to this prison food. Granted I came here of my own volition so I guess that's a crime that I did commit.   Portions are small. And this is coming from someone who rarely finishes a bowl of pho and usually takes half her entrees to go. Small can be forgivable. But these portions are also... oh, how do I put this lightly... shockingly un-delicious. You can't have both. Either be bountiful and shitty tasting. Or be delicious and small. (oh hi honey... no, not you. Never you!)  I LOVE the concept of Made Foods and really wanted this to be on the rotation as it would be fantastic for those busy nights. So we gave it a good college try and bought several portions for about $90. (Seriously. $90. Someone should be arrested here.) And several portions turned out to be... 6. Yeah, so value this is not.   We tried it for lunch one day and Mr. Anastasia had to eat two portions. He was furious. First, because they were bland. And then because he had to endure a second one just for the semblance of full. So that's about $30 of un-deliciousness under duress without any real prison lovin'. And lastly probably because I called him Mr. Anastasia.   Let me put it to you another way, we received a card in the mail to try a free meal from the Made Foods by our house and just threw it away. Or did we eat the postcard? Either way would be a better experience.  Have I actually been in a prison? Well, no. But I've seen enough shit go down during chow time on Prison Break. And Orange is the New Black. Oh and that Oz phase. So I'm pretty much an expert and I declare: If you lack taste buds and got money to burn, come here.   (But literally taking a torch to cash might be more fun and fulfilling. You've been warned, fish.)"}
{"text":"I've had some great experiences with MADE meals, but I also had one negative experience that had caused me not to want to go back. I bought a naan chicken dish and the broccoli in it had gone bad giving the meal a sour taste and smell. I emailed the store about my experience and they told me I could probably get a replacement meal if I brought in the label on the box. As I hadn't kept the label I didn't pursue things further and said I wouldn't be back. Being an avid customer prior to that experience I would have expected better customer service. Also frustrating was paying good money - around $15 - for a rotten meal."}
{"text":"We spent $40 on two salmon \"meals\" and we were unbelievably disappointed. The container was small and was only filled halfway with two tablespoons of quinoa, 4 chives, 6 green peas, 2 pieces of cilantro, a few pieces of shrivelled up spinach and literally ONE piece of Kale. The salmon was a super tiny slice and so dry that I had to choke it down with large amounts of water. For the money I was disgusted that they could get away with charging so much money for such a tiny amount of poor quality food. I would NEVER order from here again and would NOT recommend anyone waste their money here. It is better spent at Freshii if you need a healthier take out option."}
{"text":"I've been to Made a few times, including their food truck, and have had their food at some events as well.  I like visiting their food truck when I can find it downtown - they're great for a healthy lunch!  If I had any areas for improvement, it would be to amp up the flavour - I find their prices pretty price-y, but I wouldn't object if the food was more flavourful."}
{"text":"Made Foods is a new company in Calgary with four locations all opening in short succession. I visited the first location off 85th Street in the SW three days after they first opened as well as they're grand opening. The store sells cold packaged prepared breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks.   I've tried several dishes and while the quality of the ingredients seems great, some I've found to be better than others. In particular, I found the curried lamb and the beef tacos the best of the items I tried.   For the price, I find the portions small as compared to what you could get from similar stores, such as Sunterra. However, I really appreciate that they provide nutrition information for the meals.  Some of the dishes are awkward to heat, as they come with garnishes such as arugula and fresh herbs. You end up needing to remove the garnish, heat the meal, then put the garnish back on. As well, many of the dishes come with poached eggs, which can be hard to heat properly.   I'll be curious to see how often new dishes are brought in. In the meantime, I can see the place being a good option to pick up on nights that you don't feel like cooking, but still want something \"better\" than fast food."}
{"text":"I've been trying to eat better but I realize that often translates to an all or nothing approach for me...  balanced and healthy vegetarian food often means I HAVE to cook at home.  But then I go from eating out a lot to having to pencil off sunday to menu plan, shop, cook, package, clean up... maybe it gets faster with doing this more regularly but it's a terrible pain in my butt and I don't usually get more than a couple weeks of this before I don't have the cooking time and I'm back to eating out again... sometimes with groceries in the fridge, ugh!    I first found made meals for sale in a little store at work and I tried one for lunch and it was super tasty so I bought all the rest of their vegetarian meals to keep in our fridge at work and each one was equally satisfying.  Then I realized they were in crowfoot which is actually super easy for me to regularly buy from and I dragged my husband in to give it ago.  Omnivores like him have more options particularly at dinner but he was also a fan.  It's designed to pick up meals and leave but there are also tables and a place to heat up and eat there which is great.  Made is chef created, nutritionally balanced (there is a nutritionalist on staff), largely organic, fresh, locally sourced and eco-friendly packaging. What I particularly like was the vegetarian food was not a high glycemic load like many veggie options I typically find even in healthy food places.  If I suddenly became very rich I always thought I'd like a personal chef to make tasty healthful food for me and this might be the closest option atm.   So we've decide to supplement much of our regular eating out habits with made for now and save restaurants  for date nights and socializing.  The goal to work cooking into our routines slowly so it doesn't have to be a huge life change.   It seems really expensive... $8 - 14 a meal or so.  Most of the veggie meals are $10 or less.  We find we need some groceries to supplement (snacks and extra veggies for fullness because the portions are smallish )   Overall it's more than fast food generally but less than sit down food on a semi regular basis.  Considering most fast food makes me almost sick to think about,  it's much cheaper than the slower food I have generally been preferring lately.  They do have a 10th meal free program which certainly helps a touch.   It hasn't been too long but so far so good...  and I'm starting to feel a bit better.  I'm a bit concerned about getting bored with my options (I can be fickle with my food affection) and I wish they were larger as I don't find the portions overly generous.  I need to work on a plan to deal with some of the hunger I've had some days which has lead to some health derailing snacking."}
{"text":"I don't even remember how I stumbled upon this place, but I'm glad I did because it is a life saver on those busy days! Not many places offer quick, healthier meals if you're pressed for time and don't want to stop at a fast food place. Their breakfasts are what I lean more towards because I am awful at breakfast and have a bad habit of sleeping in instead of feeding myself, so Made Foods saves the day! I found that they do heat up pretty well and was hesitant with the poached eggs, but they have always turned out fine. I usually pick up the sweet potato hash as well as the flipped oat pancakes, and will complete the meal by making my own green smoothie or something to have a little bit of a more balanced breakfast for myself. I have tried a lunch and dinner item, but I don't remember any of them leaving really much of an impression.   The staff at the West Springs location (85th St) are very helpful in explaining the service and offered samples of their upcoming new meals. She also threw several different types of BBQ sauces to sample as well with my purchases.   While I do see they more directed toward a organic, wholesome type meal. I am kind of disappointed in the lack of veggies in some of their meals and don't find that they are really complete, in my opinion. I would also like to also see more brown rice, whole-wheat or multi-grain options.   For the portion sizes, they are definitely a little bit more pricer then what you can expect, but I mean that goes with anything thats certified organic, it will always be a little bit more. I was told that they will have a completely new menu in the next month which it nice to keep things fresh."}
