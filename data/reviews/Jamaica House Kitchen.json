{"text":"Jerk chicken is amazing, flavourful, and moist. OX tail is gross."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food.   I had to comment after my last  two experience. I ordered a small jerk chicken dinner and received a large container of mostly rice and dry tasteless burnt chicken.  The large container was used, but the portion size of chicken very minimal.  I received practically no chicken.  I purchased the jerk chicken special on Tuesday.  The chicken was so dry and seemed as though it was cooked the day prior.  We tried to eat it, but we could it and had to return it.  It was awful and they knew it."}
{"text":"I never liked jerk before eating here now I'm hooked! Affordable, Fresh, Friendly Staff and Large portions. Normally I get a large order of Jerk Chicken or Pork with rice and beans and that feeds myself and my boyfriend normally with some left over! By far one of my top picks whenever we go out!"}
{"text":"this place is pretty run down and the service is terrible.   The lady who took my order was on the phone using headphones the whole time ... it was so awkward   I went with my boyfriend - we got jerk chicken dinner and a curry chicken dinner.   The coleslaw had no dressing & my curry chicken had so many pepper kernels I was scared to bite into one the whole time.   The jerk chicken was ok, but I've had better almost everywhere...   Idk... The whole experience was pretty bad and dining in was just sketchy.   We asked for extra gravy and got this oil concoction on the side .. so gross.   Wouldn't recommend this place ..."}
{"text":"Terrific jerk and fried chicken. Also the soup is great too. Each time I've ordered, the food tastes fresh which is really important. I only ever do takeout and haven't ordered much else, but if you want something very tasty and reliable then here is your place."}
{"text":"The food here is good, service can improve. Sometimes it seems like they are overwhelmed with the level of service. Orders tend to get mixed up and there's nothing worse than paying for something and getting the wrong order"}
{"text":"Food quality has deteriorated. Bought a small jerk chicken dinner and ended up with food poisoning. I suspect the rice and peas was stale and reheated."}
{"text":"At the end of a wild weekend in Toronto, we ended up eating a parting meal here near a friend's place in Brampton. Boy, even though this place is in the suburbs, you can see the authentic Caribbean influence here in Toronto. Inside this cozy, basic restaurant it almost feels like you are at a low key spot in the islands. The service, food and atmosphere was all relaxing. The interior is quite basic which added to the feel in mu opinion. I got a jerk chicken meal that was cooked excellent with the right blend of spices and tender meat. Prices were a tad steep, but I know Canadian spots to be that way relative to American prices, and portions were a good size. I would recommend this spot for a hearty, comfort food type meal. It's got a real touch of soul."}
{"text":"Good food.  I had large jerk chicken with rice and beans, which was nice but the rice was not fresh and had hard chunks.  Also bathroom sink water was ice cold."}
{"text":"The fry chicken is just too good! I walked into this place randomly looking to get jerk chicken. I ended up getting the jerk chicken and fry chicken and they both were great! But My fav was the fry chicken! I always try to get the oxtail gravy but usually they're out of it so I settle for the stew chicken gravy which is also good but the oxtail gravy is better in my opinion. I also call in my order however, they may not answer 70% of the time. Been coming here for about a year! Pretty good authentic Jamaican food for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the best jerk chicken I have had so far. Smoky, spicy, juicy and all around damn good. Always hear there commercial on the radio so I decided to check it out, glad I did. Busy place, but not a long wait for the food, so don't line the long lines deter you from staying. The line is long for a reason, the food is damn good. Looking forward to returning and trying more items on the menu. Again the jerk chicken is next level ish, good job guys!!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to eating, ackee salt fish and dumpling from others.. but oh my goodness. There ackee salt fish and dumpling makes me happy! The rice and peas is good, and so is the jerk chicken.. although I had better jerk chicken, I'm giving this 5 stars because the ackee salt fish and dumpling and banana tasted so good"}
