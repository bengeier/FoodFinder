{"text":"I've eaten pizza from them in the past when we visit the in-laws. Closest pizza place to them. The pizza is average. Toppings are pretty much the same as any other pizza place. The sausage,ground beef and bacon are different than Pizza Pizza but they taste better in my opinion. I like the sauce more than Pizza Pizza as well. Tastes like rago, not sweet and you can taste the dry garlic/basil seasoning.  Wings are small and sauces are from WINGS. Garlic bread is terrible. Chicken nuggets taste like Janes nuggets. Potato wedges taste like Double Doubles/241 wedges. Prices are cheaper than Pizza Pizza. You'll get more at Pizza Pan. The storefront is cluttered and somewhat dirty. Slices are not impressive but cheap. Same rolling pizza oven that 241 cooks their pizzas with, which sometimes can lead to oily pizza. Delivery times vary. Sometimes they are fast, sometimes they take an hour. A solid 3 stars for a small neighbourhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"When I am too lazy to cook my family has used their delivery family deals for years.  Best delivered food for the price that feeds a lot and the food is decent.   

Flexible too.  When they were out of the McCain cake and I said I was not partial to the potato wedges, which are an option of one or the other as part of the family combo, they substituted eight extra chicken wings.

Have not been in the restaurant, so I can only speak about the delivered food.  Yet one cannot purchase the ingredients to cook the family deal, for the price with free delivery.  Fast service too."}
{"text":"I love this little shop in my neighbourhood.  My boyfriend tried to tell me about it for years, but it looked like such a crappy hole-in-the-wall I never bothered trying.  One day I let him talk me into it and now I love it!  Okay, it's no gourmet pizza joint or anything, but they have good pizza for good prices and better than most of the chain pizza places.  The pizzas are a bit on the salty side (I get pepperoni, which I'm sure doesn't help), however I'm a fiend for salty foods so I love it.  Their wings are good.  I got medium but they weren't spicy.  Next time I'll get hot or super hot. Yesterday I got a souvlaki dinner, which was also really great and only $8.50!  You get a lot of food for the price.  The walk-in specials are great, but I usually like to opt for the square party pizza (something about it just brings me back to childhood.)"}
{"text":"Great food, great owners!! See my pic of the veggie pizza in the photos!! Delish!! The restaurant is very clean, which is a big plus!! Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid my mother and I used to order their 2 medium pizza special and it was great pizza. Now 13 years later, I decided to order their special 7 menu, that includes 1 medium pizza with 3 topping, wings, 3 drinks and garlic bread for $23 and some change after tax. 

This place continues making great pizza and their wings are delicious! I would say you get your bang for your buck. 

I will def. be ordering pizza from here instead of ordering from pizza pizza or any other large company."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a no star love the one on 158th in westpark happend to be in ridegville for work so decided to try and the sauce was way to sweet and the pizzas were soggy, I ended up having to order from some place else so glad I payed money for garbage"}
{"text":"It really is a shame cause the pizza is great, but the customer service at this particular location sucks. They charge $3 per topping, anywhere from $2-4 dollars for delivery, tell you it'll be there in 40, and an hour ten later your family is still waiting on dinner. Then the delivery guy has the nerve to look pissed he didn't get a tip. Here's a tip, be here when you say you'll be here and apologize for my wait if your not. If you need delivery from this place,  I hope you live in Tremont."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Pizza, my daughter said the crust was good.  Local radio station plays in background.  Located next door to our hotel.  Affordable , daily specials."}
{"text":"i don't care which location you choose - pizza pan pizza, by far, is some of the worst pizza i've ever had.

greasy.  generic.  greasy. ...greasy.

like eating a dude's hair who just rode in on his motorcycle with his white tee-shirt sleeves rolled up, aviator sunglasses on, and jeans worn in 1957 greasy.

yes.

their pizza is travolta greasy.

of any of the local pizza joints, why does this one have so many locations?

there.  i'm done on my rant.

seriously.
travolta greasy.

eww.

i'm not eating scientologist pizza.  no thanks."}
{"text":"New owner is super nice. The place is super clean and the pizza is delicious. Sauce has a slight sweet taste to it. Kids love it too!"}
{"text":"This was really good pizza,and  my family enjoyed it very much. They gave a delivery time of 45 to 50 minutes but was here in around a half hour. The price was very reasonable for two pizzas. I will definitely order from them again. I gave four stars simply because it wasn't the very very best pizza that I've ever had, but for the price very good."}
{"text":"Always get the small deluxe pizza. It is definitely made well. Also get a side salad. Love the food, have never had a bad one in the past three years we have been coming to the Cleveland Clinic."}
{"text":"I have never seen the actual restaurant, but I have ordered in from here multiple times. I skipped the pizza and go straight for the complete dinner combos which are pretty decent for the money. The shawarma and doner dinners are by far the best of the lot- not a big fan of the chicken. Obviously, all the side dishes have been sitting around all day, but for $10/plate delivered, you really can't complain. The portions are huge- I look forward to trying the wraps and pizza when I will inevitably order from here again. They also don't complain or overcharge when you ask for extra sauce/napkins/plates/cutlery."}
{"text":"For $17.49 we got 2 medium pizzas and breadsticks.  The pizzas were pretty good and hot.  We were staying at the Comfort Inn next door so it is immediately next door.  

This can get pricey BC they charge $3 per topping."}
{"text":"Ya know what? It's good. I can honestly say that Pizza Pan delivers on a solid pie. Honestly, though, when it comes to pizza it's really hard to find one that I won't put into my nutrient portal. The main reason we gave these guys a shot was because we got one of those \"welcome to the neighborhood\" free pizza coupons. How can you beat a free, one-topping pizza? OK, maybe if it was delivery. But listen, I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't delighted, I was satisfied. Pizza itch scratched.

Some of the good. The crust was a nice, mid-level thickness with a crispy outside and slightly doughy interior. Just what you'd like in a crust. I prefer the edge to have a bit more to grab onto, but all in all, not a bad showing. The sauce was also tasty. A tomato-based, traditional marinara with some decent fresh tomato flavor. It was a bit on the sweet side for me, though, but this is personal preference, not a knock. The customer service at the counter was top-notch. At least that what my wife tells me. I sat in the car when she ran inside. Friendly, welcoming and customer-oriented.

So let's nitpick. Toppings people. Seriously. The pepperoni was fine, about two slices per piece, not a bad ratio, but the mushrooms and the banana peppers? It was like playing Where's Waldo with these things. And they claim their pizzas are the \"healthier choice\". I have a feeling it's because they skimp on toppings. And what's wrong with using fresh mushrooms? A simple thing like fresh toppings really goes a long way, folks.

The sauce. Again, where the hell was it? It's a good thing we got an extra little container of sauce with our cheese bread (which was really good, btw) because the actual pizza itself was just a bit dry. The cheese was good but lacked the char that I like. The cheese bread had a nice char, so they got it right there. The salad? Well, it's exactly what you'd expect from a pizza joint salad - iceberg lettuce, olives, tomatoes, croutons, shredded provolone cheese, pepperoni. Expectations met.

There's a schtick here that's worth mentioning. If you buy a pizza or some ribs you get one free. That's right. It's BOGO all the time here. We weren't sure we'd like it so we opted not to take the freebie this time. Bigger parties will definitely like this.

So, great pizza? Not so much. It's good, pretty good really. Friendly service, even on the phone, and a very low price point as far as pizzas go. So I guess for the money, I can't complain. Just skimpy on the toppings. I've gotta give 'em credit though, way to spin the whole minimalist toppings thing into a healthy thing. I mean, the pizzas cost them less to make, people think they're eating healthy(er). It's a win/win, right?"}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasant. The food was mediocre. I had pizza and wings. I will liking not return."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST customer service.  We have given them multiple chances, yet they always come up short. The first time we ordered, my husband and I ordered wings. I got the \"1/2lb\" and he got the pound...they were the exact same amount of skin and bone wings.  When I called to complain,the lady basically told me tough luck.  Next time we ordered,  it took almost two hours for our freezing pizza to come, with the wrong pop. Once again I was told too bad.  Tonight, we said let's just try again...wow.  Placed our orders online and were waiting an hour, just to find out THEY ARE CLOSED. ON MONDAYS. Thanks for the email 15 minutes after the confirmation email."}
{"text":"OMG!  First timer here...we ordered the original Stromboli and a meatball one and they were 'out of this world' delicious!
I met the owners who are there making the pizzas too. What great guys...super friendly and they make their food fresh!
  We will definitely be back to sample everything on their menu...you can even create your own!"}
{"text":"I ordered $52.00 worth of pizza and wings and we were completely disappointed!! They changed their wings and they were horrible! They were the smallest wings ever! They were rubbery and under cooked even though I asked for extra crispy. Never again!! They must be under new management or something and the new wings suck!! Don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Pan isn't good, they have a BOGO gimmick which draws people to them. So yes this place is great for portions but not so great for taste.

It's really below basic pizza that you could make yourself, you aren't getting anything special here. The reason I dislike it so much is I've had it so many times to tell you that it's just below average. They somehow by the grace of God landed a contract with the Cleveland Indians to serve their pizza, why I don't know? But so many places are better than this chain that you might as well cook your own pizza up and save a headache.

Ask yourself this, how bad does ones food have to be to offer free food since its opening and still have chains close down?"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from Pizza Pan.  I haven't visited the physical location, so I can't comment on accessibility, cleanliness, etc..

It's your typical, inexpensive pizza delivery place.  I felt like the price was too good to be true, and I was right.  The cheese used on the pizza is obviously a low grade mozzarella.  It left the pizza pooling with grease, especially in the center.  I've also ordered wings from there.  They were obviously previously frozen and lacked any real flavour.  They were also quite chewy and lasted a little freezer burnt.

With so many delivery options in Toronto, it's hard to imagine that I'll be ordering from Pizza Pan again."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, all the employees seem to be having fun while doing their job. No skimping on the sauce and cheese like a lot of other Pizza pans do.
Great place to stop and fill up after a long day of turkey or deer hunting."}
{"text":"Good Pizza.  Not greasy like some of the other places in our town.  The Staff is ALWAYS friendly and greets us with a smile.  They do offer a buy one get one free, which is great with kids that like different toppings.  You will not be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Seriously Cleveland?  I know pizza can vary by city, but the pie I got from this place was pretty lame.  Dough was flavorless and had the texture of mushy bread.  Sauce tasted like store brand spaghetti sauce, and there was so much of it the layer of cheese and toppings literally kept sliding off the slices when I tried to eat them.  The pieces of pepperoni had zero flavor.  You could do better by taking an English Muffin, spreading on some Prego and some shredded supermarket cheese and baking in your toaster over.  The prices are cheap, and the guy who served me was friendly but this really is a case where you get what you pay for.  Spend a few extra bucks and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I dont eat much pizza but the stuff I have had from this place has not been good.  The guys making it make me wonder about their cleanliness too.   The ONLY reason I gave this place another star is because it use to be a strip club (The Silver Fox) before Tremont became the Den of Diabolical Douchery.."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I tried their pizza and it was really good!  The lady who took my order was really Nice and the pizza showed up super fast and hot!  We will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"If you don't like low-rent pizza, you might not like this place. If you do, this is the best low rent pizza I know.  Nothing mind-blowing, but nothing disgusting, which is a lot to say for pizza this cheap.  The wings are tasty and are a filling 8 for $4.29. One slice of pizza costs under a toonie (I had to google toonie to check the spelling)."}
{"text":"guilty pleasure pizza! always has fast delivery. I really like it"}
{"text":"There are times in your life when you raise the white flag and decide not to argue.

Your boss buying pizza from Pizza Pan for everyone at lunch when you forgot to pack a lunch and you are light on money is one of those moments.

The pizza pan gimmick is BOGO (buy one, get one free). All the time. This is why they charge $18 for an XL one item pizza. 

The pizza is pretty mediocre. The crust is doughy. The cheese is mozzarella but tasted a bit funky like the cheese on a grade school cafeteria pizza. As KK mentioned, it's greasy and generic. 

If you want to treat yourself or guests better, go elsewhere. 
I was thisclose to making it a one star review, but I ate the pizza because I was hungry."}
{"text":"It was conveniently located, delivered to our hotel room door, and cheap. And gross. It actually is, literally, the worst pizza I have ever had.  It was soggy and the dough chewy, the cheese tasted weird like it was freezer-burned or something, and the pepperoni wet and sad.  After trying to get through a piece like a champ, I gave up and ordered from someone else.  Do yourself a favor and pass."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price. Buy one get one on pizza and ribs (which are decent). I have health problems and a sensitive stomach and the sweet mild sauce has made me be able to enjoy pizza again. Calzones are decent and salads as well. I definately reccomend this to fans of sweet/mild sauce. You can order online now (which is cool). Recently moved back to the area and made this pizza pan my Go To for pizza nights."}
{"text":"Calzones are HUGE and only $5-7 depending on ur toppings. Calzones make my life. Omgggg"}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza! They don't skimp on the toppings and also don't know why people are saying toppings are $3. An extra topping is 2.50 for BOTH PIZZAS if you're getting two 16\" pizzas. Less than that for two 12\" or 9\" pizzas. All pizzas come in twos. The pan crust is pillowy and delicious. Ranch is 50 cents and you get a 3 oz cup. For reference, Papa John's sauces come in a 1 oz cup. Lame. Anyway, check the pics if you don't believe this 'za is good. It is, trust me."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Great Prices, and Great Service!

My husband and I always go to pizza pan as our go to pizza joint and we have never been disappointed!

Their pizzas are delicious and they always have fantastic deals as well - you can t be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not bad pizza, not great. Anything else is to be avoided. Service is pathetic, and the guy acted like he was doing you a favour when you walk in the door. Funny attitude to have, if my business is that much of an inconvenience then I'll inconvenience someone else."}
