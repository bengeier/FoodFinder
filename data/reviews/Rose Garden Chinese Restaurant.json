{"text":"We eat at a lot of different restaurants, of all flavors. This is a great little restaurant for families and folks looking for great service at a great price. All we needed to do was to ask for a change and abracadabra, it was done.

This is not a place to take your rich relatives, or especially those that are wannabe's, but for a good Chinese meal where your kids are OK, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"First timer in this restaurant in about 13 years living in the area. I am very picky with my Chineese and this place did very well for me. Small but not too small, very comforting. Family owned and do they really know how to put love into their food. Will definatly come again. For those who care I ordered : Chicken Low Mein, Veggie Low Mein, Orange Chicken w/ steam rice."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last.  We were going to the play next door at Theatre in the Valley so decided to try the chinese Rose Garden.  We thought the food was fresh, hot and flavorful.  This will definitely be our \"pre-theatre\" dinner spot. We haven't tried the lunch specials but will definitely  be back to  give them a try too."}
{"text":"I have lived out here in Vegas for ten years and had trouble finding good Chinese food until driving through downtown Henderson and came across Rose Garden. This is some of the best Chinese food I have ever tasted. I love their coconut chicken!"}
{"text":"We were in Henderson for 3 nights. Found the Rose Garden online. It is on a side street and not in a new, fancy area. BUT the food was absolutely wonderful! My husband ordered  Chicken Kon Po and I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. I was delighted when it arrived and had the goodies that restaurants use to serve: the yummy sauce, peppers, onions,carrots and pineapple!  And such a nice presentation on a tray. The restaurant is older but nice inside and the staff was very gracious. We live in N.C.  and will probably never get here again but that will be our loss."}
{"text":"Neigbors had recommended Rose Garden so we ordered take-out last night. What a disappointment. Lemon chicken was thin and breaded (not battered) and deep fried with orange sauce - tasteless and gritty. Hot and sour soup tasted smoky and awful and went into the sink. Schewan was described as \"not too spicy\" and was so hot it was not edible. Fried rice was good. They forgot the curry puffs and we got a double order of cheese wontons (strange things these). Would not recommend and will not go back. The people were friendly, the place is clean and prices are good. Just not what we think of as 'good' food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for NYE. The service was prompt friendly and delivered hot! 
Next time I would up the spice factor from medium to hot as two dishes we got just needed a little extra kick but the flavor was def good. We ordered way too much food but who doesn't enjoy cold Chinese ESP with a hangover. Looking forward to the egg foo young for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very close to 100% awful  Only the cheese puffs, the sesame chicken and the chow fun noodles were even edible. Both the walnut and salt & pepper shrimp dishes smelled and tasted spoiled, said our chef friend. His daughter said the egg drop soup tasted like her car's Fabreze air freshener smells. We also had sweet & sour pork, Wor Seafood, hot & sour soup, and none were worth eating. Seriously the worst Chinese food any of the six of us had ever eaten - what a waste of money! And worse, I'm so mortified that I chose the place for my family  I wish I could give this place zero stars!"}
{"text":"Polite and quick service, but the soup smelled like cat urine and the rice and appetizer were extremely bland.  Not good food at all.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people. They have never messed up an order or given bad food. It's the best I have found in the Vegas Valley so far. I really like the Mongolian Beef. It's just spicy enough to give it flavor and not be overbearing. Lunch specials are a great size and price."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp of course. It's located in downtown Henderson. Don't be discourage by the look of the exterior. Small restaurant, family friendly and shockingly great food. My husband said that they have the best general chow chicken that he has ever had in Henderson/Las Vegas. That's a big deal, since we've had many Chinese meals in the past...and he always compares them to the restaurants in New York. The interior reminds me of the Chinese restaurant from the movie \"A Christmas Story\". :) I love that movie. I'm not sure if they serve whole duck tho? I'll check next time. 
So cute, quaint and comfortable. From the zodiac paper place mats to the red hanging paper lanterns.  Not stuffy what so ever. And the prices are very low and affordable. This spot is now our new go to Chinese restaurant. BTW, they deliver or you can order for a pick up. Service was great from the young man who was very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Great service, clean, doesn't smell like food in restaurant (some Chinese places smell like you're in the kitchen), price was right and food exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I don't know how this place got 4 stars? I guess all you locals have not tried real authentic Chinese food. And you have to settle for this hole in the wall place. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall establishment that serves amazing food! You can call in advanced or dine in. Coming from SoCal, I can tell you that this place is on par with the best out there.
One issue I faced today though, while ordering takeout, make sure you ask for utensils and napkins. Although the fortune cookies were appreciated...utensils were simply not present."}
{"text":"I just decided to do my first review. I eat at this restaurant quite often and enjoy it so I decided to check out the reviews. I read one review with someone complaining because of the amount of food was not to satisfactory. I have to say that one of the reasons I like this place is because of the large amount of food. If you leeave here hungry that you need to change your diet. Even the lunch special is enough for 2 people to share.  The service is awesome, and the food is excellent. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef pepper steak for 5.25 and it came with soup and spring roll. Food was really great and the price was even better:)"}
{"text":"Ah, sitting alone in an empty restaurant while listening to Christmas music and eating crappy Chinese food.  Ya gotta love the holidays.

I'm sorry, but when the crunchy noodles that come free with the meal are the best part of the meal, then you've got a problem."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The food is really good for the price that you pay. If you are looking for good Chinese food at a decent price this is the place to go. This place is good for kids and adults."}
{"text":"While the prices may seem a little high at first, my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised just how much food comes with pretty much any portion size. A combination plate is half filled with your choice of rice and the other your entree. An order of chicken fried rice takes up the entire styrofoam container. After ordering the Sweet and Sour Pork plate with rice, Chicken Fried Rice, small Wonton Soup, small Egg Flower Soup, and a 10 PC of pot stickers, it became very clear upon arrival that we weren't going to be finishing all the food for one meal.

As far as taste goes - it's quite alright. Rice has never been my thing, so me being a critic on that front doesn't seem fair, however the Sweet and Sour Pork is plenty flavorful, the Egg Flower Soup is very satisfying, and the pot stickers are probably my favorite from our selection last night. I wouldn't come here for the very absolute best in take-out, but I would come for large portions of pretty good food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area and were looking for decent Chinese food. We were pleasantly surprised and fully intend on returning. The service was great and the place, although a little dated, was very clean."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, hot and plentiful. So hot that I almost thought they must have heated it up in a microwave! Lol Except for the fried rice. That was on the verge of being cold.
Great service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Mandarin in the Henderson area.  It is fast and they get your order right the first time.  Our favorites are the House Fried Rice, Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce, Orange Chicken, and the BBQ Pork.  Always delicious.  I have lots of Chinese places closer to me but this one is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great service and food we eat here every week, best Chinese in Henderson and very friendly"}
{"text":"Ok folks! So I was jonesin for Chinese food BAD!!! I hate to tell everyone about this place because it's my FAVORITE Chinese restaurant. Its my go to. But that wouldn't be fair to them. We ordered take out online. Everything was done online order, payment, tip etc. We ordered the Family meal. Comes with won ton soup, egg rolls, cheese filled won ton, house fried rice. We got Mongolian beef and general two's chicken. I also ordered side of shrimp and won ton sticks. When I got there the food was ready and super hot......WOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!! CHINESE FOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! literally walked in got the bag and left. Maybe a minute of time.  Got the food home and set it all open. DAMN THAT AROMA!!!! We devoured it all. It was like a blur.....we just kept eating it and eating it. I felt like a Chinese food addict. It is always DA FREAKING BOMB!!!!. NEVER CLOSE ROSE GARDEN WE LOVE YOU!!!!! That is what I feel about that. It was so good I didn't even take pictures.....and I always take pictures. Literally open boxes and consumed them delectable gems.......GREAT JOB ROSE GARDEN!!!!Rose Garden Chinese Restaurant. Below was my order. I added stuff obviously.

{"text":"Despite what Yelp has to say about it being closed today, on a Saturday, this restaurant is indeed open.

The hostess was prompt and courteous with getting us a nice booth for our party of four. I ordered a Raspberry Iced Tea, which was just fine for a flavored iced tea.

For lunch, they have awesome lunch special deals. I got the Beef Lo Mein with the Egg Flower Soup, Curry Puff (aka Crab Rangoon), and Steamed Rice. All of which was hot and delicious when it made its way to the table. The portion was a good size for the buck, although I wish they added a little more rice on the side. Hey, beggars can't be choosers. The entire meal with the drink came to a whopping total of $6.75. That's a steal to me!

All in all, I was satisfied with my experience. I recommend it for anyone who likes Chinese."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special today and I was impressed!  One of the best Chinese food restaurants I have found in Henderson.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"well, after reading the reviews on yelp I wasn't too sure if I was willing to try Rose Garden but I took a chance and joined my family there. 
I sure am glad that I went. we had beef & brocolli, crispy noodles, gen tso chicken, orange chicken, other noodles, scheswan beef and steamed & fried
rice. unlike many smaller chinese restaurants... each entree had its own unique taste instead of all tasting similar. the staff was very friendly and
aimed to please. will definitely return soon and would not be afraid to recommend this. I have a soft spot for small family businesses but when the food
is good too, it's a big plus!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite mom and pop Chinese restaurant.. ten million times better than PF Changs. I love their schezwan beef!"}
{"text":"I got the Lemon chicken and Garlic chicken. It was good. I don't know what else to say. #RainDayHusband"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.  Last night I placed a carryout  order online for a family of 5, for my husbands birthday dinner.  He went to pick up the order and ended up waiting there for almost an hour.  Finally got home with our food and realized they forgot all our rice.  We called in hopes that they would bring it to us and no one answered the phone, so we just ate our riceless dinner.  The soup was luke warm,  and the fried wontons were cold, but other than that all of the food tasted really good. Just wish the customer service was as good as the food.  Too many other restaurants to choose from, so there is no reason to settle for bad customer service. Bummer."}
{"text":"I was super excited upon arrival at this cute little, authentic Chinese restaurant. Our gentleman server was very kind. We noticed there was no music in the restaurant and that kind of killed the vibe a bit, so someone in my group mentioned it and they turned the music on. The 3 star rating is mostly for the service and aesthetics of this place. The food was mediocre. Fried rice was bland, minimal ingredients. The Mongolian beef had 90% onions and 10% meat..... the prices are reasonable here though so I guess you really do get what you pay for. I probably will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! Not only is the food yummy but the owners are so friendly and kind. We had a order delivered the other day and of course it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a retro, old style Chinese restaurant.  Found this place on Yelp for Henderson's old downtown and thought let's check it out.  Pricewise, very reasonable.  Food quality, I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars.  The Mongolian beef was overloaded with too many onions, not enough meat.  The house fried rice was OK, but definitely have had better.  The pot stickers were the one thing that were really delicious though.  Not bad, but probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Place is s little hole in the wall never busy.But the food is great! I drive over 1 hour to eat there."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Great value on lunch specials from 11 to 4pm.  Nice family run business. Food is good. Big portions for price.  Never that busy so food comes out guick. Wish it was busier."}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese food, I am serious as a heart attack. I've been fortunate enough to grow up eating Chinese food at least once a week every week since I was a kid, so I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to Chinese fare.

What I'm trying to say is that Rose Garden is, by far, THE BEST Chinese restaurant I've eaten at here in Henderson. It's the closest to what I've eaten growing up (it may even be just as good--or better?!?!) and I'm so lucky that I've found it!

I'm an emotional eater. I eat when I'm sad. I eat when I'm happy. I eat when I'm stressed. And guess where I run to when I'm experiencing these mood swings??? To Rose Garden!!

It's ridiculously affordable and more importantly, DELICIOUS!! Customer service is great!! And might I mention, it's AUTHENTIC (cook speaks Chinese...if you know what I mean), and it's family-owned.

I don't know what else to say. This place just rocks. I've been eating here for the last couple years, and I'll be eating here indefinitely.

P.S. They have amazing specials, and EVERY SINGLE THING I've tried, from their beef broccoli to their shrimp tempura to their hot sour soup---is MIND-BLOWINGLY GOOD. Trust me, it's not that time of the month for me at the moment, so my review remains unbiased."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot and delivery restaurant! I've tried many menu items. I've never been disappointed. I've brought friends who come from other states. They all love the food and friendly service and prices as much as we do."}
{"text":"its not the best but also not the worst. it gets a little pricey when you order by dish, but the lunch specials are reasonably priced. if you are expecting gourmet chinese then this is not the place for you. the rice is dry and the food is okay. nothing real special. customer service is good. very friendly family."}
{"text":"The War Wanton soup...had 2 shrimp...the pork in it , had an old taste..the 
wantons were mush..  not what I was expecting..from all the good reviews."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food in Downtown  Henderson. We get spoiled with the great value of the Family Dinner with great appetizers, wonton soup and yummy fried rice. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Went last night because I had no idea it was even there.  Only had one server on and he was pleasant but within a 10 minute period  6 more guests arrived which put him as we restaurant people know the term (in the weeds) and had a hard time keeping up.
I had two guests with me and unfortunately we all received our entrees at different times  as well the hot and sour soup was good but barely warm.the food was good and hot.
Prices are good for what you get but the curry/veg rice bowl needed allot of help. Very bland.
The General tsao was excellent but the fried rice needed some help too.
Overall it was just ok. But will return to try some of the other entrees."}
{"text":"Chicken teryaki bowl was not appetizing! Veggies and rice were mushy and the chicken was rubbery! Really wasnt flavorful at all! The soup was tasty though."}
{"text":"I love a hole in the wall place.  You get good service, good food and a good price.  Rose Garden in Down Town Henderson is no exception.  I first heard of it through Yelp a few day prior to my visit.  It sounded good but I was already home for the night and didn't want to go back out.  Instead, I waited until after a morning hike on Saturday.  I came it for lunch and was pleased to see the lunch menu on the table.  So many places do not offer their lunch specials on the weekends.  This place does.  Awesome!  And the lunch specials are a crazy good price.  I think some of them start at $3.25.  I got the lemon chicken lunch for $4.95.  For this incredible price I got lemon chicken, fried rice, a bowl of hot and sour soup and a curry puff.  Not a bad deal.  Not bad at all.  And it was good food too.  

The chicken was the classic and better known to me style meaning it was a whole chicken breast breaded and fried then sliced and drizzled with lemon sauce.  The fried rice was about the same as you would find at other places but I can't say that I have ever had just a stellar fried rice that blows all others out of the water.  I've had some horrible fried rice in the past.  This was not one of those examples.  The curry puff seemed to be a cream cheese rangoon with some curry in the cheese mixture.  It was good but I would have liked a little more of that curry flavor.  I was given the choice between the curry puff and an egg roll.  I went with the curry puff because it sounded different.  I will be sure to try the egg roll next time.  I was also given a choice of soup.  It was between the hot an sour which I ordered and the tradition standard egg drop.  I went with the hot and sour because that is what I was craving when I first read about Rose Garden a few days prior to this visit.  It was more spicy than what I am used to at other Chinese places around town.  It may have even been more sour.  There was something that seemed off at first but I grew to like by the time I finished my bowl.  Not sure what though.  Probably just a flavoring I am not used to.  I could get used to it though.

I will be back.  Probably a lot I would imagine.  I think this just became my go to Chinese restaurant in the Henderson area.  I liked it that much.  I look forward to trying other items on the menu.  There is so much more on both the lunch and dinner menus.  The one thing I don't look forward to is the radio.  I think they are using an old radio with an antenna and it didn't seem to have the best reception. There was an awful lot of static.  When it comes to food, service and price, I'll learn to tune out the static."}
{"text":"Salt n pepper shrimp - make it happen! Their house fried rice is legit along with the hot and sour soup. I would say they could update their sign outside or make a website... seems like their living in 1965 for some reason. I Guess good Chinese food hasn't  changed in 50 years!"}
{"text":"Really displeased in this restaurant. I ordered the orange chicken plate with white steamed rice. The orange chicken was good - wasn't great. But the white rice is what killed the whole meal. It was stale and very hard. To the point it was hard to swallow without a beverage to chase it down with. White rice is the most simple dish to make and it was ruined to the point I threw the rice away. All of it. I have a choice of that or fried rice. Maybe I should've tried that. I'm still giving this place three stars just because of how fast I received the order. Literally less than 20 min. Very fast service..but maybe that's why the rice was awful."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

    In the heart of downtown Henderson's Water Street District there sits a small family-owned restaurant named the Rose Garden. It is in anything but a rose garden. It stands in a turn of the century business district that looks like the Old West. It is off Pacific Street between Water and Atlantic Streets a stone throw from Emerald Island. What is an amoly about this Henderson business is that you can park on a street without a meter then walk inside. On my visits, I'd park in the parking lot by the gun shop. 

    The Rose Garden is one of the two Chinese restaurants in the Water Street District. The other one is the Lotus. Being that I am on a mission to try different Chinese restaurants, it is no surprise that I dined here twice. 

  I'd take advantage of the lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese restaurant lunch specials are the best deals around. As soon as I looked at the lunch special sign in the window, I saw prices starting at $3.95 with the pork lo mein lunch special. The starting price entrees were only a couple. The majority were a few cents short of the average lunch special price. 

  From my experience, Chinese restaurants come in two varieties: the take out and casual restaurant setting. This is a casual restaurant setting. Their is a waiter that brings the food to the table in regular plates with silverware. This is not a China Go Go setting where they serve the food in containers with plastic forks. 

   The first time I dined here I ordered the shrimp lo mein lunch special. The second time I ordered the pepper steak. It came with skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce, hit and sour or egg drop soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Hot tea is an additional 50 cents and a glass of Coke is 99 cents. After a tip the food would come out to $8.00 which in reality is on par with the majority of lunch specials. 

  If this were a job performance evaluation, the food would be a solid performer but not a great performer. The service was likewise good. Then again it's not like I was sharing the place with many people either. 

   The thing I dislike is that the check does not separate the tax, beverage, and entree. When I tip I like to double the tax. Oh well! 

   It was nice dining at Rose Garden two times. The reality is that I prefer The Lotus and new China Inn very close to The Rose Garden. In my opinion, they are a star better with larger servings and not much more money. Additionally The Lotus offers wonton soup. Ultimately in my opinion Rose Garden is a solid Chinese restaurant but nothing great."}
{"text":"Upon walking in I noticed an immediate unpleasant smell, which I thought might be contributed to the construction outside so I thought Give it a chance. My girlfriend and I both ordered off the lunch specials and the sauces had decent flavor but the chicken was poor quality and somewhat mushy inside its batter, rice had no flavor the only reason this is not a one star is the staff was polite and two meals cost 11$"}
{"text":"Rose Garden Chinese is located in \"sleepy\" downtown Henderson. I was hungry for Chinese food for lunch and having had some bad experiences I'm always on the lookout for new places to try. 

Parking is on the street, and without a lot of people around I didn't have to park but 3 spaces from the door. Stepping inside you'll find a clean but yet a little bit dated restaurant that does offer plenty of space. 

Service was prompt and attentive without being overbearing. My menu was on my table in under 60 seconds, I had my order taken in under 3. They have lunch specials and I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Egg Flower Soup (aka Egg Drop Soup), and it came with an egg roll and a wonton. 

While I waited on my food I looked around. The place had several older couples and a noisy group from Chicago in there that were almost finished and were leaving. On the table they had Kimlan soy sauce but they didn't have any sugar, just packets of Sweet N Low. I thought that was kind of odd as usually you get a choice. They also left the regular menu on the table and I took a look. The back cover says they don't use MSG. I took a picture of that as well as I hate MSG. My Egg Flower soup arrived and while hot, it was nothing special either. Lots of crunchy noodles were sacrificed in order to make it workable. 

The food arrived fairly quickly and it was hot. Not pepper hot, I'm talking physical temperature wise. Kinda made me suspect microwave usage but I can't confirm that. I snapped a picture of the plate...fried rice on the side, Kung Pao chicken on the other so you can see what I had in front of me. One thing I look at with Kung Pao Chicken is the celery / filler to meat ratio. This plate ended up having a bit more celery than I like to see. Also it's not Kung Pao anything without peppers, and the plate was a little skimpy on the peppers. I counted the equivalent of 2 peppers. It should have been at least double that. 

The egg roll was no better than the stuff you'll find at Vons in the frozen food section. But the deep fried wonton was not good. It had very little filling, and what was there just didn't taste good at all. I didn't spit it out but the thought crossed my mind. 

As I finished up I put my debit card out on the table and not long afterward a man approached and said their credit card machine was down. I ended up paying with cash, but in this day and age there's really no reason to not have up to date and working payment systems in place, even for a small business. 

Overall....if I find myself in downtown Henderson and hungry during the week I would consider coming here again. 3 stars: For a lunch special the price is perfect. And they only charged $.99 for a soft drink which is almost unheard of in the land of $2 and UP for the same thing elsewhere.  

Note: They don't take checks (checks are evil anyway) and they do offer a limited selection of beer, wine, and sake is mentioned too on the card on the table. Also if you want to see if a place is kept clean, just look up. The air vents in this place were clean...which is a sign of attention to detail."}
{"text":"I usually love the food and service but today we ordered one entree and two sides and it took over an hour for delivery. I understand if a restaurant gets busy a call would be nice just so we are aware you are still on the way. The food is excellent but today the delivery was slower than usual."}
{"text":"Delicious, freshly prepared traditional Chinese food! Waitstaff were very attentive & pleasant. My husband thought it was the best sweet & sour chicken he's ever had!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the lunch specials are at a great price. I usually get the beef and broccoli when I come for lunch."}
{"text":"I was in this location attending a seminar, didn't want fast food so of course found this place on Yelp. Their lunch specials are cheap and a good size. I got egg drop soup, orange chicken and rice for under $7. The chicken was not overly fried and the sauce was not too sweet. Over all good experience."}
{"text":"Let me save you from wasting your time and money. Skip this place! Run, now! I wish I could say there was one thing good about the food here, but alas I can not. I'll give it to them the staff was attentive. Probably due to the fact there was only one other couple in the place. 

My husband Joel and I went here for lunch instead of Lotus over on Water St. (I should have stuck with Lotus.) The lunch menu has many choices. You get an entree, soup, an egg roll and a wonton. I decided on the Kung Pow Shrimp and Joel ordered the Orange Chicken. First, came the egg flower soup. Totally lacked flavor. When our lunches came out we dug in cause we were extra hungry. The look on Joel's face. His Orange Chicken tasted like someone mixed the Orange Sauce with Sweet and Sour Sauce. It was red, gloppy and had an off texture. Bad soooo bad! My Kung Pow Shrimp was ok. It seemed to mostly contain celery and a few shrimp. Not as spicy as I expected either. We both got fried rice. Ick!! Off colored and totally void of any flavor. I was thinking ok, the egg roll could be good, maybe. I was wrong!!! Talk about gross. I really think it was rotten because it had such an off taste. I quickly spit it out. 

I asked for our check and we hit the road as fast as we could. I'm happy to report I did not get sick! Whew! Just never go. Plain and simple. You'll thank me later!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered walnut shrimp, beef lo mein,  sesame chicken, and pot stickers(they didn't make it to take a photo)!!  All of the food was exceptionally tasty.  No complaints! This is our second time ordering from Rose Garden and this is our new favorite take out!!"}
{"text":"I hoped to find a local Chinese restaurant that was better than the others.  Unfortunately, this place did not meet our needs.  Decor was old and tired, menus were outdated and did not reflect recent changes in specific dishes, egg rolls with chicken had very little of this added ingredient, rice was served cold to lukewarm.  However, service was nice, hot & sour soup was flavorful."}
{"text":"This is my to go chinese take out restaurant. It is on water street right next to a beauty salon and only 5 min away from home.
Their lo mein chicken is good and comes in big portions with lots of chicken.
We always get family A 
2 soups
2 eggrolls
2 tempura shrimps
1 fried rice 
2 main entrees 
Feeds 3 people  for only $20
If you are light eaters then you can even have some left overs :-)
The wait is usually 25 min when it's a slow day
And the staff are very sweet, although they don't speak perfect english they still put in the effort to help you understand.
3 stars because they told me my order would be ready in 20 min but it took them 50 min and they messed up my order twice."}
{"text":"We come to Rose Garden at least once a month and their hospitality is above par. The portion sizes are always large. Not to busy here as it's in hidden part of old Henderson but I do recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Food was really good and fairly cheap on the Lunch specials. The servers were really and fast when I asked for extra sauces and utensils."}
{"text":"Just moved to town maybe two months ago. Hands down my favorite Chinese food restaurant in Henderson.  Great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times during early afternoon and only a few customers, but all were regulars. Service was great, egg drop soup is incredible!! The food was very good as well. This is always going to be a place to return to."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here! Not many people there but the food was good great portions. Been going here for years. Staff is very caring and try to keep your drinks full. Interior can use some work though."}
{"text":"I have been here everyweek for the last couple of months and this place has really started going down hill. From the egg drop soup smelling like urine, to the new Asian server giving me his little attitude because I didn't tip on a pick up order, giving me the completely wrong soup, the Kicker is what happened last night....A big piece of black hair in my fried shrimp!!! It means the cooks don't wear hair nets or hats (like they're suppose to) and the server Does Not Care. I hate saying sh*t like this but Darcy spears (from Dirty Dining Segment ABC News Las Vegas) is right when it comes to Chinese restaurants...they are Dirty!!!"}
{"text":"OK food, never too busy, a relaxed environment, pleasant. The service could be more friendly I must admit however. I absolutely adore the feel of old school mom and pop restaurants. It seems in this corporate world they are becoming much harder to find especially here in the west."}
{"text":"This place is in old downtown Henderson. And it's old. But old is good in some cases. The staff here are friendly and polite. The food may take a while, but good food isn't slapped together. 

The moo goo gai pan here is authentic and tasty. They also have some standbys like chicken and broccoli or orange chicken. My only complaint is that they have a difficult time keeping up during busy hours or with large parties. Otherwise, I like to go and support local businesses."}
{"text":"I love this place. Above average Chinese food in my opinion, and prices are very reasonable. Looks to be just a family who runs it and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"Thought we were going to San Pan. When we got there it has changed their name. We looked inside and nobody was in there. We thought that was strange at 1pm on a Saturday. Well we went in and decided to try it. I will say I was pleasant surprises everything was very good. The place was very clean and I don't know why it wasn't busier. This is a good hole in the wall Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place to come to since I moved here 6 years ago.  The food is always prepared fresh. The service has always been friendly, kind, and they remember people, I am always greeting with warm smiles and greetings. This is truly one of the better places to eat."}
{"text":"Little family owned place in downtown Henderson. They remember all their regulars. I'm not the biggest on Chinese food but found it to be pretty good especially the pork fried rice. Don't expect anything fancy but it more than gets the job done."}
