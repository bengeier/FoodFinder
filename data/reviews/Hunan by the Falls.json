{"text":"I really really love the food here. Every dish I had was very flavorful. The texture, smell, presentation, and portion were all very good as well. The service was good, as well as the atmosphere.   I'll be back. Highly recommended for good authentic Chinese food. :)"}
{"text":"Hunan in Chagrin is one of the best restaurants around. The food is excellent! My family and I have been coming here for many many years, the servers are friendly, and the owner always recognizes us. Reservations are recommended because it gets very crowed (especially on weekends.) As far as the menu goes I haven't tried anything that  I don't like. Some suggestions would be: Wonton Soup Walnut chicken General Tso chicken Mala string beans  Also despite the name it is a couple miles away from the falls..."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!!  I live in Chicago and was visiting with my boyfriend.  Loved the neighborhood and was craving some stir fry. So we thought, let's try Hunan ... looked adorable and the parking lot was packed ... good sign!    We walked up and were greeted by a friendly door man, friendly staff and one of the owners!  He also gave us tons of food suggestions and everything we ate was perfection!  The food was amazing!!!   Loved every second of our dining experience and cannot wait to come back.  Plus, this is such a cute neighborhood!   We walked next door and had a chocolate martini as a night cap after.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Food- If you are fine with two table spoon worth of sugar in the entr√©e, this place is not too bad. \"Hunan\", however, is clearly a misnomer. All the ingredients are coated in this excessively sweet sauce that make you ponder whether to eat this will cut back 1 week worth of life expectancy, for the sugar load. And this is on the spicy dish.The positive is that, food like this could be ready for us fairly quickly. Service- nice, attentive.Decor - OK if you like a Warhol-ish prints on the wall. The space left between adjacent tables could be as narrow as one feet. Finding your way out is a sudoku. Locate the exit, you might want to be closer to it."}
{"text":"Great chinese right in Chagrin Falls!  A terrific first experience.  Vegetable Spring Rolls are great - flavorful filling with nice crispy outside.  Just as they should be.  Spinach Dumplings are incredible, slightly sweet  (good enough to be dessert)  Thai Chicken Satay is nicely spicy.  Satay sauce is full bodied without being heavy.  Vegetables crispy, noodles light and tender."}
{"text":"The orange sole is lovely! The plate comes loaded with hot pepper seedpods but, thankfully for this spice-aphobic, the dish was just pleasantly flavorful. I was surprised the pepper didn't heat up the sauce, but it was mild, as advertised. The prawns with candied walnuts was also a sweet winner. No worries, tho, for those of you who like the heat - there are plenty of spicy choices, including a short Thai section on the menu. They DO take reservations and there is additional parking in the back. Service is quick and polished, dining room party-loud on a Saturday night. Claim to fame: back in the day they had a toilet seat which would automatically \"re-sleeve\" itself with a freshly hygienic (I think) rotating seat cover!! I'll never forgive myself, but I forgot to check it out this time! Just one more reason to revisit this yummy place!"}
{"text":"I've dined here on several occasions. The service is always friendly and efficient. I love the crab rangoon , the walnut chicken, lo mein, the chicken lettuce wraps, the prawns. It's too bad they don't have a better location but I'm not going to give them any less than 5 stars because I appreciate their service their delicious food, and the portion sizes are a great value."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all, this place is not by the falls, or anywhere near water as far as we could tell. It is actually a pretty non-descript little place on one of the roads outside of \"town\", that is, outside of the charming walkaround part.  Having said that, we found the atmosphere to be very pleasantly neutral with soft classical music and modern art on the walls, instead of the usual red and gold lanterns and usual music you find in many Chinese restaurants.  And, the food really is a cut above any other Chinese restaurant we have tried, which actually bums me out a bit because we live pretty far away and now we are no longer satisfied with our local Chinese place, because the quality of the food at this place has ruined it for us.  The portions were very ample and everything tasted really fresh. In particular, we were being blown away by the spring rolls which had REAL WHOLE SHRIMP in them, and were oh so satisfyingly crispy.  We also loved the Crab Rangoon, the Thai Chicken WIngs (which were very large),the Hot and Sour Soup, the Walnut Chicken (yum!) and the Fried Rice.  Everything was just really good, and we took home enough for lunch the next day - alright, actually it was breakfast, but that's the way we roll when there are good eats in the house.  The service was also outstanding, though I admit we were there at a slow time, so we will have to test this some time when they are busy. Oh, and the staff were very attentive and nice.  We will definately be eating here whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"One of my top three go to restaurants when I visit my family in Cleveland. They have a delicious fish (i think it is sea bass). I have enjoyed every meai here. The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo good. I have been there four times now and the food is always anywhere from awesome to rediculously awesome. Soups and apps are not anything special, but the entrees are. Try the beef with baby bok choy and mushrooms. Try the shrimp with black bean sauce. Try anything. I think you will love."}
{"text":"One of the very best Chinese restaurants in NE Ohio . Had Hunan chicken for lunch . Portion and food quality was good . Spring roll was freshly made . Would be back !"}
{"text":"Service was slow slow slow. Sizzling rice soup had no sizzle and very bland almost no flavor.  Would not recommend this place. Also they play favorites with locals they know. Bad way to do business"}
{"text":"We love Hunan by the Falls! In fact, believe it or not, my husband proposed to me in the parking lot there years ago! Kind of a long story...   We were one of their first customers when they opened 15+ years ago, and the food is still fantastic and the servers are still terrific!   The food is incredibly fresh, no MSG, and the portions, which other reviewers have mentioned, are enough to have extra for lunch the next day.   The main parking lot is very small, and sometimes people picking up their  take-out orders will block you in, but there is a larger parking lot behind the restaurant that you can use.   Hunan by the Falls is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Northeast Ohio!"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant that is a cut above your normal Chinese restaurant. Excellent atmosphere and also great for takeout. I had the Compal shrimp today and it was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Thai duck in coconut milk and cardamon is great. Plenty to take home."}
{"text":"Amazing! I am originally from Chagrin Falls and whenever I come home, THIS is the spot I have to visit. The spring rolls are GREAT - hot, crispy, and filled with real veggies and shrimp! I always get the potstickers - they have a thick dough, not like other places. They have brown rice - and the GOOD, sprouted brown rice, not some cop-out. Other favorites: orange sole, mala beans, wonton soup, ying-yang prawns (a special of half walnut prawn and half salty prawns). They do speedy-fast take out too!  Parking can be hard of Friday and Saturday night, so just use their lot behind the restaurant. They also do take reservation if you are trying to catch a movie or don't want to wait - altho I have never waited more than 10 minutes.   This is great Chinese food, and a bit more expensive at dinner. If you are looking to save cash, try coming during lunch. Many of the same great dishes plus soup or spring roll for less!  Bottom line: Best Chinese in the eastside suburbs, HANDS DOWN."}
{"text":"Best Chinese on the east side of Cleveland.  Hands down.  We love the Beef Chow Ho Fun, Hunan Beef, Twice Baked Pork - so tender....Walnut Prawns, Sesame Chicken are all so good.  Great dumplings too.   I've tried the pad Thai a few times and didn't love.  Noodles seemed dry so now we stick to the Chinese."}
{"text":"Our favorite Asian food in the Cleveland area so far they are flexible with the spiciness and fast. We have been here several times and have yet to have a bad meal (or experience). Inexpensive for lunch, and the portions big enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"I've gone here about 6 times. Almost everything is awesome. The specials menu always has new and inventive dishes/appetizers."}
{"text":"Service is very good and food is fresh and delicious.  Great variety of Chinese dishes and unique specials."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a Chinese fan... My kid and hubby loved it.  The servers were friendly and prompt.  I would like some more space between tables and some vegan American food on the menu.  I had a bowl of rice.  It was fine.  I'm just not a Chinese fan.  The place is clean, and the prices are slightly steep."}
{"text":"Edible. That's about the best I can say. We ordered 6 items, \"spring roles\" (very weak; soggy), steamed dumplings (doughy), Szechwan Sesame Noodles with Chicken, Singapore Style Chow Mei Fun, Fried Rice Hunan Style, Deluxe Wonton Soup. We ordered very basic items in order to get a read on their food as we're moving into town. Every item was very bland and not very good. I could go into reviewing each item, but it isn't worth it. Go to the tavern two doors down instead."}
{"text":"Hunan has been here for years- I think that it used to be better than it is currently, but for our area, it is the best Chinese food around.  The interior of the restaurant is horribly dated and it looks as though the water features could use a good scrub.  On most nights, you will have to fight through people waiting near the door for their take-out food.  We just about always get take-out from here.  Try the General Tso's chicken, medium and extra crispy.  The spring rolls are terrific- we order them with double sweet and sour sauce rather than the mustard sauce.  The fried rice is pretty good, but I ask them to crisp that up a bit too.  The Peking pork is an interesting dish and most of the noodle dishes are pretty good too.    Prepare to pay a pretty penny for this Chinese food.  It's not cheap- a dinner for four will run about $70-80 with a couple sides and enough meals for four.  That's take out as well, not dining in."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food. The prices are above average. Parking is very limited. Awesome, friendly staff. The menu feels really long except for children. Hard to find something for picky kids."}
{"text":"As someone who's grown up eating Chinese food and eaten out a lot in NYC, I'm always on the hunt for a decent Chinese-American restaurant. After reading the rave Yelp reviews for Hunan by the Falls, we were keen to try this place, wondering if authentic cuisine might just be hiding in this quaint little town. But we were disappointed. I can't fault the service -- the staff were great, very friendly and personable. But our sesame noodles appetizer was served hot when it is traditionally served cold, and the Hunan shrimp was not spicy at all. When we asked our waiter about the sesame noodles, he admitted the dish had been adapted to patrons' tastes. The bill for the meal wasn't small either. I write this review simply to let others know that the menu caters to local palates, so if you're looking for authentic, you probably won't find it here."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in the area.  Period.  And the other Asian foods are extraordinary as well.  Try it and it will become your favorite too.  After 50+ visits we've never had anything less than a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food ever.  Every year when we visit family up there, we always order from this place.  It is awesome, non-greasy, non-fatty and just everything that most other chinese food place aren't - great!  You can't go wrong ordering from here.  I've always had it to go and it travels very well."}
{"text":"Good food, but a little tight...  THE UP-SIDE:  A pretty big selection of different Asian food.  I especially loved the Thai Chicken Satay.    THE DOWN-SIDE:  A decent atmosphere, but a little cramped for me.  Not too bad, but just a little.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for really great food!"}
{"text":"Hunan has been at this same location for about as long as I can remember. It is clean and has a nice uncluttered decor. They've been serving Asian dishes for years, and doing a fine job of it. Here you can order your food more spicy if it suits you. The service and food are very good. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They can help you decide what to order, if you aren't sure. If you like Asian, go to Hunan. It's really nice."}
{"text":"Consistently great food!!! The sauces have excellent flavor. I'm never afraid to try a new dish because every new dish is always excellent!! The service is excellent as well!!! If you go often, the waiters will remember your name/face - makes you feel very welcome which only adds to the great experience. Make a reservation if going on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Definitely above average Chinese food.  A little pricey, but worth it.  Even the service is above average."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Comfortable. Better than average chinese food though overall it is still a Chinese food company."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, great service. Had the crispy lamb and chicken with vegetables and was tons of food. The potstickers were wonderful and the spring rolls were the best I've had. Will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Cleveland.  The walnut prawns are amazing in both flavor and texture, its worth the huge calorie intake.  Other highly recommended dishes are Mongolian Beef, Hunan Chicken, spring roles and fried rice.  They make everything fresh and it shows.  Not easy to get in and out though... make a reservation and leave yourself time to eat."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for lunch. We each had a spring roll which came out piping hot and seemed fresh. I had the Kung Bo, which I wish was spicier but the flavor was really good. Hubby had General Psos - he said he wished he had ordered it extra crispy and that it was spicier, but that it was good as well. Server was friendly & attentive, and we had lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly people. We only get take out and it's always good. The Hunan chicken is amazing! And their chicken fried rice is too!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time at Hunan by the Falls and it was just as good as the first time. The food is nothing spectacular, but it isn't greasy or too spicy - unless you ask for it to be. I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein, which was good except that the shrimp tasted slightly off. It could just be my tastebuds! The atmosphere is welcoming and the servers are very attentive. The one younger boy refilled my water over 5 times while we were there for about 45 minutes, which was great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. It is always well prepared food with generous portions that are quickly devoured. Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Meh.  Chinese food for the undiscriminating masses.   Fried rice should be fried - not bland white rice pilaf with freezer section carrots and peas thrown in it.     Hot and sour soup, well, not so much.  The seafood egg rolls were good - too bad you can't make a meal out of them though."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food, they use so much MSG I actually had an adverse reaction that's never happened to me at any restaurant before. Again the food is just not good."}
{"text":"Consistently the best Chinese food in the area.  Portions are huge and prices fair.  Service is sufficient and it is usually possible to get in and out in an hour. Thai cuisine has been added to the menu also.  The only problem here is selecting from the many choices, all of which are excellent."}
{"text":"We've been ordering here for at least 15 years - I don't think I've had a better spring roll.  Singapore Street Noodles and General Tsos are family favorites."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely excellent. Not only was the service excellent, the owners greeted us themselves and made sure our experience was as enjoyable as possible. Super down to earth staff and peaceful atmosphere.  The food was at minimum above average. Nothing was excessively greasy or overbearing. Pan fried noodle, beef bok choy, salt baked sole were just a few things we ordered and highly recommend to first timers. The atmosphere was enjoyable and acceptable for a group and of friends and I plan to bring my parents here as soon as possible."}
{"text":"My grandpa brought this home for dinner tonight. It was the best I've had...not that its saying a lot because I'm not a connoisseur of Chinese food or anything. But it was fresh and flavorful. The sweet and sour pork had a slight smoky taste, which  I first found a little odd, but still very good.  I really enjoyed the Moo Goo Gai Pan, and the shrimp spring roll. I'd give this a shot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have food. We ordered Chinese Thai wings which are sweetened by honey. The spice Level is not very high so people who like it spicy can safely order 'hot'"}
{"text":"This place when I first went there was pretty good but after a while it's changed and not that many people go there anymore.  This place needs to be renovated and change their menu but I still enjoy attending the restaurant!"}
{"text":"By the reviews, I was expecting the best Chinese food of my life. That's a huge expectation. I'd maybe say that the food is just very, very good and is the crave-worthy traditional Chinese food I would expect around the east side.  Pros: + Plenty of spacious seating. + Very fair pricing for lunch. + Huge lunch portions. + Quiet, courteous crowd inside the giant open space.  Otherwise, we had the Sesame Chicken and Walnut Chicken for a late lunch. Both had huge pieces of chicken, giant broccoli and were doused in sauce. Super flavorful. The decor isn't the most hip and modern in the joint, but that doesn't bother me. Its certainly a nice place to come and grab a bite, but might not have the romantic decor some are hoping for. Also, do note that Hunan is literally just \"by\" the falls. You can't actually see it from the restaurant interior, in case that's a deciding factor for you (it wasn't for us, we just wanted Chinese food).   The service was excellent, the restaurant was very clean, and it was exactly what we expected. I'll definitely be back to try them out for dinner. Worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch and ordered the rice noodles with their \"faux\" chicken from the specials menu.  It was very good.  It's not particularly authentic, but it's tasty.  Service was also good.  The decor is awful.  1989 obviously exploded inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The guy handling the phone orders sold me on some 'big and meaty' chicken wings. They 'weren't like other wings!' he went on to promise. I am a sucker for the dream of big wings and happily added an order anticipating a certain level of greatness that in hindsight realize is seldom reached.  The dream of reaching that chicken wing pinnacle was soon crushed. I was entirely disappointed by my order, especially the scrawny wings!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here forever, and there is one simple reason: it has some of the best damn American Chinese food ever. What to order: Tangerine beef, sesame noodles with chicken, hunan lo mein (whatever meat/combo you like), wonton soup, prawns, ginger chicken (not on the menu, just ask for it), spring rolls. Mmmm and now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Step above your ordinary Chinese take-out. We split 6-8 dishes among us and they were all great. BBQ Spare Ribs, Potstickers, Fried Rice, Chicken and Beef dishes all had great flavor without being too greasy or salty like some take-out tends to be."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese restaurant!  Hunan Chicken done hot and spicy with fried rice is what I get every time.  Never found a hot and sour soup or jade minced chicken (chicken lettuce wraps) that even compares to their versions.  Also highly recommend the potstickers, especially the sauce that comes with them - wonderful to put it on fried rice too.  Great atmosphere, especially for lunch when it's not packed, and cheap prices for the quality."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! Been eating for over 8 years. Though it isn't the most authentic, it is definitely better than any run-of-the-mill Americanized Chinese restaurant.   Food suggestions: Salt and Pepper Calamari Beef Ho Fun Hot and Sour Soup Coconut Shrimp Yau-Tsai with Portabello Mushrooms  On a different note... One time I tried some of their Thai food, but wasn't impressed :/ It was Pad Thai, and it wasn't like any Pad Thai I had enjoyed in the past."}
{"text":"The Pad-Thai was the best thing we ordered and it wasn't really even pad-thai.  The spareribs were ok.  The cashew and almond chicken dishes were just sloppy messes.  I love wonton soup but their wonton soup has shrimp which I don't eat.  I had the hot and sour soup and, eh, not impressed.  I haven't lived in Cleveland in awhile, but Hunan Coventry and Ho-Wah I remember as very superior alternatives."}
{"text":"We ate crab Rangoon, egg roles, Hunan style fried rice, Kung bo beef, and bourbon chicken.   The food was good and reasonably priced. It is not best Chinese I ever had good... But it is good for this area of NE Ohio where there are not a lot of choices. Each dish was made fresh and with a good portion size, although it was not very spicy so if you like more heat you should remember to ask.  The service slow during a time when there were not a lot of customers.  The decor is very 1980's."}
{"text":"This is my first time to the restaurant. It was highly recommended by friends. The ambient is really nice with white tablecloth service. We had the spinach pot stickers which as a little cheese and spinach inside. I really enjoy the bounciness of the pot sticker skin. The one we really enjoy the most is the Braised butternut squash in 5 spice. So happy when the restaurant works with seasonal dish. The hint of 5 spice, hoisin flavor and sweetness of the squash makes it so delicious. The walnut prawn is very delicious. Lightly coated sauce with sugared walnuts makes it complete. I had the lamb stir-fry and very delicious. Meat was very moist and tender.  Great place. Call ahead for reservation on Saturday."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Hunan by the Falls made even better by the wonderful service we received from Henry, our server. We sat right next to the water feature which was relaxing. I always eat the healthiest dishes I can find and Henry recommended the basil chicken with lots of fresh vegetable and little oil. It was delicious and had enough left over for a sizable lunch the next day. My honey ordered sesame noodles for an appetizer. I could bathe in that sauce it's so delicious! He ordered an alligator dish off the specials which was wonderful as well. We highly recommend this restaurant and ask for Henry for fabulous service."}
{"text":"We have had some great dinners here -- great General Tsao's Chicken and nice wine list.  However, we ordered out once and it was NOT that good.  I don't know why, but the dinner couldn't be finished.  Good service, okay for kids, not that big of a dining room!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area, check out the specials list. the traditional dishes are all great. even for a Chinese pl;ace the Pad thai isnt bad, make sure you specify the heat. The spring rolls were fresh and not greasy, the satay \"wet\" didnt have much noodles. The won ton soup was nice and the rest of the dishes were fresh and flavorful. great and fast take out if needed."}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the past & since Yelp didn't exists when I first started going here I completely forgot to write a review.   My husband & many others have always enjoyed the food here. But being the picky eater I am have found it increasingly difficult to find items on the menu I eat & therefore, have stopped coming. I just felt that the few things I did enjoy just weren't worth the drive.   However, there was one occasion when I placed a carry out order early in the morning before the lunch rush. I had hopes of surprising my father with lunch at work - the place was completely empty other than one other woman who had similar plans.  The older gentleman who works there was so nice and welcoming!!!! He introduced himself and offered  myself & this other stranger to share a small table & enjoy free hot tea while we waited for our food. He even brought us the morning paper & encouraged us to talk with one another. It was a very pleasant surprise and I have yet to receive such hospitality from any other business.   The place is always clean and has some pretty paintings on their walls, the service is always polite and the food is worth the trip if you live close by."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time the other day based on the good reviews. It turned out to have delicious food for a very good price and you get a ton of it. I had leftovers for lunch the next day. Their sake was about as good as it gets. It was expensive for a glass for two, but I would have to say it was completely worth it. The atmosphere was very agreeable and it was casual but I feel upscale for a Chinese restaurant compared to ones I've been to. Don't let the name fool you, however, it was not located by the falls. That didn't seem to matter much to me though. If you are looking for a great Chinese restaurant with both spicy and mild food this is definitely a place to check out and if you love spicy things I would highly suggest the hot mustard with the egg rolls."}
{"text":"For $19 my shrimp dish had better be pretty good. There are not many cities I'm willing to pay that much for Chinese food in and Chagrin Falls? I don't think you're at the top of my list for pricey Chinese.   Luckily my dish, the walnut shrimp, was pretty good and the portion and quality of the shrimp was high. Hot and sour soup was spicy.  The fact that Hunan offers brown rice as an alternative wins them bonus points with me.  I really enjoyed my dish, but the high price tag didn't win it any stars."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant.   But, if you are not from Chagrin and are looking for dinner in the village, this is NOT by the Falls as their name suggests."}
{"text":"We have tried Hunan by the Falls twice prompted by other reviews.   Neither visit was particularly impressive, and our last visit convinced us that it would be our last.   Meals are not particularly authentic, and the last time quality and taste were not very good either."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for Mothers Day and Easter because it's not busy during these holiday lunches. White tablecloths. Service is very good, and you can talk, as tables are somewhat close together. Extensive menu, and you can ask for anything off the menu. We always take home leftovers, so plenty of food. Have called in for carryout at dinner. Then this is a busy place."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. The food is always great and pretty consistent. Wonton soup is perfect! Egg rolls and fried rice are both excellent. Portions are pretty big so may want to share a couple of dishes. Love this place."}
{"text":"Dependable and fresh.  Hunan BTF consistently cooks up fresh culinary delights.  I prefer mine spicy, they give it an appropriate kick upon request.   Having lived in China and traveled in SE Asia, I find this to be the closest to authentic within a 10 mile radius.  (The Solon venues don't compare, for my Asia-influenced taste buds.). Peppermint Thai on Rt 87 is another fresh, delectable option.    Hunan By The Falls is worth my time posting a Yelp. :-)   Enjoy!   Tamen de dongxi Hao chi. Bu Yong hai pa."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I don't have anything but good things to say about this restaurant! The food was wonderful and service was speedy! This is easily going to be one of my go-to spots every time I visit Cleveland! I would highly recommend the beef, bok choy, and portobello mushroom and salt-baked prawn dish."}
