{"text":"Great sports bar!  Not too big just the right size.  

Food was excellent.  Beer is cheap.  Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A cleaned up dressed up version of Big Al's.  Nice tavern style restaurant with a quality pub type menu.  Plenty of TV's for sporting events at the bar and outdoor seating with both smoking and non-smoking sections.



My go to menu item is the honey habanero wings, sweet and spicy and awesome.  Also had the burgers and French dip both very good.

I think the iced tea was from a fountain not brewed, it was awful, so I got a Labatts.



 Cheers"}
{"text":"Not a thing wrong with our experience!  Cheap beer, good food, friendly service

   A little concerned from previous reviews, we were hesitant to try Al's.    But being right near our house we finally tried it out. 

Brought the dog and sat on the porch.   The non smoking section was nice!   Big tables, fans, tvs and not over bearing music made it nice.    

Our server came out to us promptly and greeted the dog with a back scratch and bucket of water for him! 

The beer was cold and cheap, the food was very reasonably priced and the menu had tons of variety.   Surely something for most everyone. 

Our server (Samantha I believe) was very nice, attentive and overall great.   The manager stopped by towards the end of the meal to see how we were and pet the dog.    

The food (wings!) Was great as well!    Big wings, great sauce, zero complaints. 

Will be back! And will recommend.    We've been looking for a close by, \"neighborhood\" bar and grill, and the others in close proximity just haven't been great.   Al's seems to fit the bill."}
{"text":"For great bar food and cheap beer look no more! Al's is your spot. We have been several times and have always been pleased with the atmosphere and the service. If the Panthers are playing, get here early if you want prime seating.
I would highly recommend the fried bologna sandwich. It's not your typical Oscar Mayer bologna. This is thick cut bologna! Delicious! Another favorite is the Grilled Cheese Burger. It is exactly as you would expect: a burger sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches. This is definitely a good one to share!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and wings not too pricey, tons of Tv's. Great friendly staff, family owned. Just a fun local bar stop by you won't be disappointed. Did I mention how great the wings are!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday game, at first service was great, one it got less busy, the staff disappeared, I had to go to the bar to get a drink and then I had a flag a waitress down to order food. Been here 3 times, 2 out of less were less than good. Boo Al's. Also no paper towels or soap in ladies room."}
{"text":"Wow! Walked in on Sunday morning at noon and walked out at 12:05! Here is what we walked into...duster and cleaning products on a table,  server cutting fruit and rolling silverware at a table, no music, sat at bar where the bartender did not address us at all. Filled up a whole cup of water in front of us and did not even make eye contact.  There were two people at the bar, a hello or I will be right with you would be nice. We wanted to venture out to a new Sunday spot. I guess we will stick with the best place up here Mac's!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome for late night drinks and food.
The service is great and so is the food. Keep in mind that it's bar food, bud darn good if you're going to blow your diet. 
The wings are fantastic."}
{"text":"In the months that this place has been open, we've dined there maybe 5 or 6 times. The food has always been good and service in general has been good.

Just got back from dinner and I had fish and chips. One of my favorites but for some reason, I've never ordered it here.  I've had burgers, wraps, buffalo chicken sandwiches, wings etc and they have all been good.

The fish and chips was no exception. Two nice and flaky filllets which I topped with malt vinegar and they were delicous.  The side salad that started out dinner was very good with an excellent Italian Dressing and Croutons.  The fries were perfect and I was quite surprised with the cole slaw.  I am not normally a fan of cole slaw in restaurants because it's limp and dripping of cabbage juice and mayonnaise. Not this time. The cabbage was crisp and evidently not been sitting around since this morning getting soggier with each passing hour. Just the way I like it.

Only word of caution I would give is that this is a sports bar associated with the Buffalo Bills.  If you're not a Bills fan, don't bother going at a time when the Bill's are playing. You can't get in the place and if you can, you won't be able to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Been a few times..food is fine. I don't expect the best from a 2-3 star rating. Super long wait even the slowest days. I generally get the same weathered waitress who also works the bar. I think honey is her name. When you order its like she seems irritated for her having to work. Some of the other workers seem bothered to be there as well. So if you don't mind waiting quite some time for moderate food and poor service. This is your place"}
{"text":"Food was hot beer was cold great place for locals but 26 TVs and only four channels represented let alone to many of them CNN. That many TVs should be diversified for all the crowd"}
{"text":"My wife ordered a French dip sandwich.  The bun was very tasty but it did not have much meat in it.   When we brought it to the attention of our server all we got was an apology.  They did't ask like many places, if she wanted some thing else or even comp her sandwich.  Probably won't be back anytime soom."}
{"text":"Thursday is .49 wings.  Wings are a little above average.  Honey Habanero is a sweet burn and Old Bay is a dry rub.  I ordered extra crispy.    The wings are not to big or not to small...  Blue cheese sauce is creamy and rich.   The issue I had, see my pic, I had some weird wings.   Funky shape, bones broken, meat very tuff.    Dunno what's up with that, over the past twenty years of eating wings, I have only seen this at BW3's.   No biggy, but lost three or four wings on my meal.  My wife had the fish sandwich.   She reports it was a small fillet, but tasted above average.   

I took stars off for the following issues.......Indoor vaping - nasty.   Loud as hell - it's a sports bar, yeah yeah.  Server was not friendly, after asking for water, it didn't come.   Asked for ranch, it didn't come.  We didn't order a second round, guess what? It came.  LoL.  

I would give it another shot, like I said, decent wings and cheap beer go a long way."}
{"text":"My last time here.  We come here most Fridays since it reopened...it had good service in the beginning but now...not so much.  Food is either too cold, having to send back each time.   Over fried pickles and flat wine.  The waitress disappears...we had enough...too bad."}
{"text":"Good variety on the menu, good food and good atmosphere.  Manager was very attentive.  As someone pointed out in an earlier post it's a dressed up version of the Big Al's most people around here were familiar with."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Never had a bad meal there! Fish and Chips are awesome, wings are always spot on."}
{"text":"If you appreciate good wings, there are none better than Als.. We're huge wing fans and whether it's my favorite, the honey habs, or my husband's garlic parm, there are wings here to please everyone."}
{"text":"Fun lunch cal Buffalo bar. Go Bills!  Pizza was great. Wings worth it. Lots of beer choices. Want to try the October special appetizers next time. Great atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"Als, I mean what can you say. Best wings around, period. Have had the same employees for over a decade, that should tell you something. The burgers are amazing, and the sky is the limit on what you can add to them, or just look at the menu and see how creative they are. Used to like Jacks corner taps wings, they really went down hill, and do not come close to the wings at als. Highly recommended. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fantastic wings go here! If you're looking for fantastic NY style pizza, definitely go here! I had the Alfredo sauce cheese raviolis last time, it was the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had in my life. I usually visit restaurants  three times before I review it and I've been there 8 times this month and I absolutely love it (primarily pertains to the food). The downside labout it would be the small space. It's almost always crowded and the wait can be long and they have $0.50 wing night on Thursdays but you can't take home left overs those nights; you have to eat them there or they get wasted which can be a bummer. The service is hit or miss sometimes; but probably more of a miss. I've had good servers and some that are not friendly and can make you feel rushed (I get that they are super busy) but a smile and a greet can't take much time."}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with Al's! If you want just a normal not fancy neighborhood bar serving you GOOD bar food, this is your place. Pricing is very fair too. And good service. All the waitresses know what they're doing and you will be taken care of! Plenty of seating, a big bar, there's some outside seating too. And good entertainment from a DJ or band from time to time. Come stop by Al's when you have a chance. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here one nice afternoon with my brother and his coworkers. Sat outside on the patio so no review here of the inside, just the food. 
I ordered the Inferno Burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was decent, nothing special. It was hot like you'd expect a burger named 'Inferno' would be and also cooked the way I specified, but not the best hot burger I've had. The sweet potato fries were below average and Daddy likes special sauce with his sweet potato fries and the didn't offer any....i also didn't ask for any....so...there's that. Waitress was beautiful....soooo....there's that too. Good place though. Good over all experience....I'd go here again. Foshore."}
{"text":"It was ok. I though the winds were very hot even for mild and the chili was watery. the waitress was nice but other than that, not impressed. The place was super packed but that was to be expected. Just wish the food was better for that was the reason for our visit."}
{"text":"Been going to Al's for years. 

Great burgers and the best wings you'll find outside of Buffalo!  

Thursday nights are $0.50 wings and they offer $2 Labatt Blue everyday!"}
