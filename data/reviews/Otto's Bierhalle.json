{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere. Great food. An awesome beer selection. Phenomenal staff.  It would be a mistake not to check this place out."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. The beer selection is amazing, lots of German beers as well as Canadian craft. All of the prices are reasonable. The food was great, we ordered the Vienna platter which comfortably fed three of us and had a variety of German dishes for us to sample. Included delicious schnitzel, spätzle, slaw and Brussel sprouts.The food prices are rather reasonable as well.   Service was great, our beers were never left empty and they seemed rather knowledgeable about their selection. Think I've found my new hang out spot."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend on Saturday. It's dimmed place with lots of cool lights ontop on the left side of the restaurant. Ordered the Feast: Bavaria which includes sauerkraut, potato salad, sausage, beet salad, pickled vegetables, pork hog and sauerkraut fritter. I also added the sides of a chicken schnitzel and the pork belly. The pork hog was amazing! It was huge enough to share with four people and we still could not finish it. It was crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. The food was great and great selection of beers. Food was severed on a platter with everything you ordered together which is great. The dessert, black forest cake was unique, but very delicious. It was two cakes with chocolate mousse on it's own and sauce. You take alittle of each and combined it. it tasted great! The seating arrangements were comfortable as the tables had enough space and you wouldn't feel squished inside the restaurant. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I came here under the recommendation of yelp and I was not let down! The service and food was great, I thoroughly enjoyed my pork schnitzel and spätzle for a fair price. This is definitely a hipster spot but is suitable for any crowd. Will be returning with more friends soon!"}
{"text":"It's great to see a restaurant with a focus and is solid in its delivery. I would definitely return to experience another night of great beers, great food and good company."}
{"text":"Awesome place! From the traditional style German food, to the excellent craft beer selections and house cocktail list, to the party bathrooms - Otto's Bier Halle is a great addition to Queen West.  The staff are super knowledgable and have great recommendations and options for everyone. My favourites were the pork belly, rouladen, spats and cheese, and brussels sprouts. I was drinking Halo Shapeshifter sour dry hopped IPA and Collective Arts Stranger Than Fiction porter. Both were great pairs with the food. They also have beer choices from Germany (traditional lagers, dunkels and wheat beers), USA, Austria, and Canada with rotating taps every week.  You can't really go wrong with anything you choose here. It's also a great place for large groups."}
{"text":"Service was on point from the start. The staff kept us updated on the seating situation while we waited at the bar. The beer, vibe and food were all something to look forward to returning to! Also, I never realized how well German food goes with beer..."}
{"text":"So yummy!! If you're with friends get one of the platters so U can try everything. We were 5 and ordered the Neukolln and got some extra sides. Everything was 10/10 from the haloumi and poached eggs to that delicious blueberry layer in the parfait. Also there is so much greenery everywhere"}
{"text":"Made reservations for brunch on a Saturday and was surprised to see that it wasn't packed. Living up to Queen St West standards, Otto's Bierhalle gives off the hipster vibe with the trendy decor. Even the washrooms were cool with the disco button!   We ordered the Full Otto however I do recommend sharing that with more than two people. I clearly overestimated our abilities. The pork belly is to die for. Melt in your mouth good. Everything on the platter worked well together, the salad was a nice balance to the heavy sausages and eggs.   Overall great food, good atmosphere! Would go try dinner next time."}
{"text":"A good selection of wurst and its cognates served on an aluminum oven sheet, the kind used in commercial kitchens ... or that's what it seemed to be.  The tap is distinctive and memorable, but sitting on high stools adds an element of danger to a more prolonged tasting session."}
{"text":"Food was good and matches perfectly with beer! Will I come back? Not really. But definitely worth visiting once in awhile. For me, this place was way too crowded and noise level was so high :'("}
{"text":"Combine a great beer list, full bar, and tasty German-style menu with a low-pretense and attractive room and you get this excellent little beer hall. The ambiance is pleasant day or night, but the casual vibe comes with a lot of ambient noise when it's busy so it's not really a great choice for quiet conversations."}
{"text":"We were excited to hear that a German style beer garden was coming to the west end. The inside decor is meant to look like an outdoor beer garden that's known in southern Germany. The large group tables (used in Wurst) that are typical seem to be missing.  The net menu is extensive, but we would like to see more beers on tap, especially unique beers that can't be found at other bars.  The food was delicious, if very heavy on meat.  Great for brunch."}
{"text":"Pork Hock, Pork Belly, Schnitzel, Club-Mate. There are no other things you need in life. Well, water.  Otto's has a great communal atmosphere which makes it great for post-work chills. Food is always delicious, and the platters make it super easy to share with friends."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and it was an amazing experience!!  The staff here are very friendly and down-to-earth, and greet you right when you enter even though they are busy af!  We had a reservation and were seated right away, and even made sure my friend's toddler had a high chair!  Huge selection of beers (brownie points for me as I'm a beer lover), and the food is just heavenly!!  We ordered 3 of the big trays for sharing (we were a party of 12), and also the pork hock!!  They all taste amazing, and the pork hock is seriously fall-off-the-bone good!!  Bonus - I made cake and they serve it without charging a plating fee (which I always think is a scam!)!  Love this place so much - will def be coming back to try their brunch!!!"}
{"text":"So we went back a second time and decided to build our own plate. It was a completely different experience and I loved what we ordered. Definitely get the pretzel--so soft and buttery. I very much recommend the roasted crispy pork skin hock. It was so flavorful and so much meat! The pork schnitzel and hot kransky were really great as well. Lastly the potato salad is awesome. It was a ton of food and we had to take some of it home.  I really wanted to give this place four stars, but it's really about 3.5 stars. We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. The decor and ambience is awesome--I really love the space. The beer was good, no complaints there.  My issues are service, price, and overall quality of the food. It took a long time to order our beers and I feel like throughout our dinner we weren't checked on very often, if at all. It was busy so I get it. We split the choucroute alsace. It was good, but not amazing. The apple sauce was also mixing with the pickles, which is obviously not good. The pork belly, potato salad, and brussel sprouts were excellent. The bratwurst and weisswurst were just okay. And for the feast and two beers the total came to around $75, which I feel is quite pricey for what we got. For comparison we spend half of that at Wvrst and it's about that much food."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I've been a huge fan of Ottos Berlin Doner for a long time so when I made a reservation here I was a bit anxious that it wouldn't live up to my love for their toller boxes. We started with the charcuterie board ($16). I love charcuterie boards (but I'm always concerned that they won't live up to how much I'm paying for it). This charcuterie board was incredible. The selections were the one of the best I've ever had - the liverwurst, incredible! Then we got a feast combo - the  Choucroute Alsace and the Spatz and Cheese. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't be enough for 3 people but it was a perfect amount. We were pretty full but not stuffed. Came around 7pm on a Sunday and it was busy but had some tables but a line started forming around 8pm  Tip: Get the pork belly!! I'm Asian.. I'm familiar with pork belly. We have roast pork regular but that pork belly at Ottos with the apple compote needs a moment to be revered.  Decent selection of beers. I expected more on draft as a beer hall (as in pages and pages) but it was a great list of both local and German beers. Loud with a background of fresh beats. Overall, great vibe and great food. Definitely would come back and bring people.  Another tip: when in the washroom, press the button."}
{"text":"This was one hearty meal.  You can tell these guys care about food. So we came here in a big group and pretty much ordered everything off their menu. There was not one bite in the whole meal that I didn't enjoy. A bit of sticker shock in the end, but I was too full to worry about it.  (I actually didn't have to worry about it at all cause a friend treated lol. Winning!) Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing place with delicious food and extremely friendly service! Don't come here expecting anything fancy or classy - as its name suggests, this is a bierhalle filled with lots of beer, noise, conversation, and laughter!  We ordered a schweinshaxe (the waitress taught us to pronounce it as schvein-hacks-e) and an Oktoberfest platter to share. The platter came with four wursts, slaw, Otto's fries, pickles, and sauerkraut.   I personally found all the wursts to be delicious, but my absolutely favourite was the hot kransky, and then the bratwurst. My parents and sister didn't like the weisswurst (they found the texture off-putting and the flavour bland), but I quite enjoyed it!  The house pickles were delicious, and the coleslaw wasn't doused in heavy mayo. Instead, it was slightly oily but still fairly light. The fries were a major hit, and so crispy.  The roasted pork hock really stole the show. The skin was unbelievably crispy, and there was a crackle with every bite. Be warned, however, as it is quite fatty. Every bite gushed with oil, but the hock also had a significant amount of collagen (mmm). It's a little on the greasy and heavy side, so be sure to share it with a larger group!  We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal, and had to take the wurst leftovers and remaining pork hock to go. My parents were ecstatic about using the pork hock to make congee... Oh, the life of a Chinese family haha!  Definitely would recommend, especially for large groups looking to have a good time!"}
{"text":"The food was great!  The beer was great!  The location and ambiance was great!    So why only two stars?    Because they kicked me and my group out of our table and forced us to leave.  They wanted to turn the table.  Make more money on someone else, so they physically told us to leave.    The manager didn't care, and the staff did not either.  They just wanted us gone.    We asked for more food, we asked for more beer, it didn't matter, we could not stay.    Because of this, they get bad review, and the loss of 6 customers.  Whoever is behind the curtain telling the staff to enforce this rule is someone that does not value return customers."}
{"text":"Take your hipster best friends here for a night out. The food is delicious and the beer selection is great.   Seating is on communal tables which gives the place a nice feeling on openness. It's busy and loud but still a great place to grab a pint and a bite.   The schnitzel is great - super thin and crispy! Option of chicken, pork, beef, or halloumi. They have the classic German pork knuckle! The food comes on a big communal tray, perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Alright beer list with decent Ontario stuff and standard German selections, decent food. Service was atrocious, though. After ordering food and a second round of drinks, someone came and told us we had to move within 15 minutes because there was a reservation for the table we were sitting at. Maybe you should have told us that before we ordered more food and drinks, or given us an earlier heads up. Then we were moved to a communal table where a staff member turned on an air conditioner directly over our heads and the heads of two other people sitting at the table. This spilled dust and some sort of liquid on us and our beers. The server was cagey about offering us replacement drinks and gave a couple of us \"replacement half pints\". You should have given the whole table a free round without question. Just moved around the corner from this place, first time there, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Otto's is a nice upgrade to the stodgy pub at the corner location beside the Great Hall on Queen St. Torontonians like new ideas and love going out for the experience and this is where Otto's delivers. I've been here a few times for beer and recently sampled their twist on classic German cooking with the Rouladen ($10). Instead of wrapping stuff with bread, the Germans wrap theirs in meat! Otto's serves a precision made Rouladen, rich and flavourful, which made my mouth water and went perfectly with my bier. German beer-drinking snack food.  What impressed me is the way the kitchen pumped out the grub keeping everyone seemingly happy. No one was waiting around for service, and the staff was on it the whole time. I saw one table vacant, waiting for a reservation which seemed silly in a bar like this. Get in and start drinking and order some food if you want, just like any other bar.  The decor is a refreshing with the lighter tones instead of the dark wood typical of pubs. And the plethora of plants was easy on the eyes if you gazed up to the ceiling. Hats off to the owners for having someone tend to the plants as it looked great. I was told the owners are EDM enthusiasts which manifests in the soundtrack which is enjoyable, and the modern and creative custom LED lighting was fun to look at, and apparently there is a light show in the main room to watch if you stay late (which I didn't catch yet). They take lighting seriously here and I agree that lighting is a big part of making an atmosphere that is beer-friendly. Oh, and the bier is sehr gut! They have Quebec's St. Ambroise stout on tap and it tastes mighty good alongside some typical German lagers. They also mentioned in stock are some fancy European ciders, rare imported biers and strong stouts with prices upwards of $32 for a 750mL bottle that are quite the experience to drink and not commonly available.  Interestingly I have a mental block trying to remember even the name, of the last two businesses that have run bars at this location, yet not only can I remember Otto's name and the funky spelling of bier easily, I have enthusiastically told several people about the place with genuine excitement and continue to do so. That's a good sign!  Ein Prosit!"}
{"text":"I went for a drink with my girlfriend on a Friday night, we were greeted by friendly staff midst the livening night crowd. We ordered two drinks and the Brotzeit Plate; the plate had a great sampling of German flavours. I'm looking forward to going back on a week day."}
{"text":"I would just visit this place for the rotating beer selection alone. With decent food we have a winner on our hand here folks for a beer hall. This was a late brunch visit on a Saturday and knowing most places get slammed our party called ahead and were accommodated without a hitch. The place has a nice open feel and the decor is a bit spartan and too the point which is just fine in this case. After going through the menu we settled on the schnitzel and waffle feasts. I noticed that they offered the halloumi cheese, mushroom schnitzels (a first for moi) in addition to chicken/pork version. Sadly the veal version was amiss as that's my reference point and its rare to find that version here in TO. We went with the haloomi and chicken version. I could have spent a bit of time exploring their beer list but I spotted the Ommegang's Hennipin beer. Being a fan of Ommegang's brews and Hennipin one of their better offerings IMO I had to order one. Rest of the folks stuck with coffee (blah according to DCs)  The platter is a visual feast and will surely draw the Instagram galore (I witnessed it being photographed from all angles while there :)  The waffles are OK. The salad and side of fruit was decent (I enjoyed the pine nuts on the salad) The Schnitzel are decent. After having tried the chicken and waffle combo elsewhere I am still not sold on the meat and waffle combo yet. Maybe I need to drown it with syrup to enjoy it to be a convert. The eggs benedict were the star here IMO. Cooked just right and with a bright orange yolk (sign of freshness). Hollandaise was OK but they had plenty of lemons on the plate to get the tartness to one's liking.  I think I will come back for the brunch again if not for the beer selection."}
{"text":"Must order at Otto's Bierhalle is their Schweinshaxe and Roast Pork Belly. Schweinshaxe is roasted crispy skin pork hock which is the German version of Filipino's Crispy Pata. Both perfect with beer . Honestly, I would order ala carte instead of the feast. I didn't quite get the price of the feast since half of the cost was the Schweinshaxe ($24)... Does this mean I paid around $31 for sides?  __  Bavaria Dinner Feast ($55) - Schweinshaxe, wiesswurst, sauerkraut fritter, sauerkraut, potato salad, beet salad, fennel, house pickles + Roast pork belly w/ apple compote ($7) - 24 hour sous vide pork belly, seared until crispy + Sauerkraut fritters - ($5.50) - Sauerkraut, potato, onion and chive fried fritter with remoulade and herb salad"}
{"text":"I really like the food and I really like the beer and cocktails. But! The music in there is very annoying, bass is too loud and really boring. It cancels out the sophisticated atmosphere of the old building, good food & drinks. Solid 4 stars for drinks. 2 stars for atmosphere - can't even have a conversation.  If they improve on this front, I'd be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest screams beer and meat, does it not? It's time to walk through Trinity Bellwoods, see the fall colours and visit Otto's. The sign is not so obvious, so make sure you watch out for it! Seating consists of long tables as well as bar seating. It's an airy space with large windows., but really loud, even when it's not a full house!   We settled in and took a look at the delightful beer menu. They offer several local brews and well as German. Since we're in Toronto AND can have these delightful local beers any time we want, it's time to cut the cord and order something new. We stuck with the German beer, but it wasn't easy! My friend chose the Schneiders Original and I had the Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier. Both are solid wheat beers. The Paulaner smelled of citrus and cloves; tasted smooth, a little sweet, a little malt with a clean finish. Tasty!   There were many meaty choices on the menu, so we grabbed the Oktoberfest Platter. It was piled high with bratwurst, weisswurst, hot kransky and bockwurst. There was also fries, coleslaw and housemade pickles. It was the wurst! (Terrible pun, I know!) I'm not a spicy gal, but that hot kransky was freaking hot! Glad I had a cold beer in hand!   The service was great. They understand the meaty and beery needs of their patrons and serve them well! I'd love to try more German beers and platters. That pork belly is calling my name. Ahhh, must...stop...reading...menu.   It's calling me; I must return!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer here! Otto's Bierhalle was on my top list.  I wanted to try their PORK HOCK (SCHWEINSHAXE) for a long time. It was good as it claimed to be.  This is the Must-Try! I would recommend it to everyone.   Food (4.75/5)  Everything was almost perfect. We love everything.  What did we order? Here..  - SCHWEINSHAXE or Roasted Crispy Skin Pork Hock ($26) (5/5).  The meat itself was very juicy, tender and tasty.  The skin was very crunchy and only little salty.  You can eat the pork by itself without any dipping sauce or have a dap of HOT MUSTARD.  I'm not sure how many types of mustards the restaurant provides but our server brought us a Triple-Hot Mustard.  They came in three small bowls and had slightly different tastes.  They might be called Hot Raddish, Sweet Russian and Sour Crunch!? Lol, I'm not sure about their names though. They were good!  They can make you eat more meat ^^.  This pork hock was huge!  I think it can feed at least 3-4 people.  We were only two people.  We couldn't finish it, so we got the leftover packed home.  Aww~ Pork hock sandwiches for tomorrow Yum!  - ROAST PORK BELLY W/ APPLE COMPOTE  ($9) (4/5).  The pork belly was 24-hours sous vided.  It came with apple compote.  It was juicy and good with the apple compote.  However, it wasn't as crispy as I expected.  They came in two small pieces.  I would feel much better if their portion was more generous than the ones they served.    - ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($6) (5/5).  I love roasted Brussel sprouts as long as I don't cook them by myself lol. I'm not good at cooking that was why I prefer to eat out.  Anyway, roasting is always the best way to cook brussel sprout, isn't it?  Sauteed is good too.  They both are a good pair with meat and beer.   - SAUERKRAUT FRITTERS ($6) (4/5)  It wasn't hot when it came.  I know that they have to prepare everything ahead of time and everything seem to take lots of time to be prepared.  I'm not saying that the fritters were not good. They were good.  I like the breadcrumbs and the sauerkraut inside, but I just prefer the hot version ;)  - SAUERKRAUT or pickled chopped cabbage ($4) (4/5).  One word...\"sour!\" lol We need it right? Because of all the greasy stuff, you consume, you will need something sour like sauerkraut or assorted pickles to tone it down a bit.   - OTTO'S HAND-CUT FRIES W/ REMOULADE  ($6) (4/5). Fries were small and skinny lol. They were perfectly cooked, crunchy and tasted good; only they weren't hot.   DRINK (4/5)  - 20 oz HOFBRAU DUNKEL ($8.95).  My husband preferred this beer than Muddy York beer.   - 20oz MUDDY YORK ($7.95).   - 14 oz FUNF HACKER ($5 during Happy Hours). I love this beer.  It tasted like cider to me  :)  SERVICE (3.75/5)  Nothing was wrong with the service, but nothing was special either. I didn't want to blame our server.  He was busy and ran around the restaurant all the time.  However, it was a little frustrating when we needed someone to help us out.  We had to wait for a long time to catch his eyes.  I actually didn't know how the service works in this restaurant.  It seemed no one else came to check on us or even looked at us.  If other staff looked at us sometimes, they might be able to call our server for us.  Do they have bussers or any server assistants?  By the way, our server did everything when we asked for it promptly.  He even changed a new beer for my husband because my husband might not mention the full name of the beer or the server didn't catch it.  He got him Hofbrau ORIGINAL instead of Hofbrau DUNKEL at first. Normally, we don't ask to change it back.  We just take it.  However, he didn't like the taste of the Hofbrau ORIGINAL.  Thanks to our server again.  AMBIANCE (4.5/5)  - I love the ambience.  It was very cozy and not too loud. They have tall chairs and regular chairs for customers. We got the tall chairs though.  I found out that it wasn't for me lol.  I will ask for normal setas next time.  I'm kind of not tall lol so I felt a bit strange to sit in the tall chair. Please don't judge! - Washrooms.  You must check it out! Don't be shy to go to each one and try the different experiences of light and sound! Step in there and press the BIG BUTTON!   SPECIALS - Happy Hour: Monday to Thursday from 5 pm. to 7 pm.  Special price $5 for specific food and drinks. - Washrooms: Dancing washrooms. - Feasts:  Special prices.  - Mustard:  House Triple-Hot Mustards  OVERALL (4.75/5)  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a solid 4,5/5 stars, and only because it took slightly longer to get our beers.  The menu here is classically German but insanely flavour filled. I made my bratwust ($6) into a currywurst (+3.50) which resulted into a delicious tray of thin fries and perfectly seasoned curry ketchup. I added some sauerkraut fritters on the side which were $5 for a pair.  My partner had a Hunter's sandwich with a delicious side of white wine sauerkrat.  I grew up eating a variant of this cuisine and man was it true to form, insofar that it was delicious and simple. The portions were decent and it's the ultimate comfort food.  This place is a decent size but I could definitely see it filling up quickly. I'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and to our surprise there is no pork hock available on weekend brunch. Regardless we had a super delicious meal. Everything is delicious, especially the platter with eggs, salad, sausages and pork belly(sooo good). Service was a bit of slow and unorganized on that day but it's OK in general. Would recommend to others for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to Otto's twice now, and I love it! Great cozy atmosphere to hang out with friends, share delicious German pub food, and the beer on tap (especially the Radler) is delicious! I am not usually in the west end of downtown, but this is a must-check-out place!"}
{"text":"I love Otto's!  From the decor, to the beautiful beer list, to the family style platters... it's everything I want!  The happy hour deals are very well priced, and the food options (small portions for $5) are great for trying our a bunch of different items. I've had the schnitzel and bratwurst, along with some other charcuterie and sausages - and I really liked most of the items!   I did find the beer to be a weee bit more expensive than most bars nearby, but for a place like Otto's I think it's justified.   Absolutely check this place out, you will not be sorry. Oh and don't forget to push that button in the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced beer and food, anything but authentic atmosphere and most of the beers are not even German!.... The sausages are ok but only 3 out of 4 are German and the disco music ruins the whole thing... And I seriously question the five star rating!"}
{"text":"Went to Otto's for some beer and food and left feeling satisfied. My dining companion had been here for beer, but hadn't tried any of the grub. It was busy when we arrived, but they squeezed us in at the bar. We both had Stone IPAs (from Escondido, CA) (14 oz., $8.00 - plus tax) - these were great.  We ordered the sausage platter ($35) and added an order of sauerkraut fritters ($5.50, 2 per order). Everything was really tasty, especially the fritters (remarkably light), the spicy sausages, the slaw, and the fries. These are the best fries I've had yet in Toronto (which is saying something, because all the Toronto fries I've had have seriously paled in comparison to any fry I've ever had in Montreal).  The house pickles were missing from our platter, and we had to get the attention of two servers to get these delivered. We're very glad we bothered, because these were delicious, and the little dish included oddball things like fennel, some orange thing we couldn't identify - no, it wasn't carrot! - and cauliflower. The sauces and mustards on the platter were good, but a little non-descript. A hot mustard would have been welcome.  If I went back, I would not get this sausage platter because I personally dislike the weisswurst (too soft and pillowy, almost creamy). I would order a la carte so I could try the pork schnitzel alongside my wurst, my sours and my slaw.  We washed all that down with another Stone.  (Beers are a little pricey, though certainly in line with other places in the neighborhood. Allow me to at least wish there was a happy hour.)  The crowd and staff are young, cool, well-heeled, and the design of the place is thoughtful and welcoming - we had our eye on it in the fall as they were sprucing up the place - it's very open and bustling. Will those huge windows open to the street in summer, I wonder, and I hope? The hanging hostas are a really nice touch and do help to give it that outdoor bierhalle feel."}
{"text":"Just went on a trip to Germany so I came for the beer selection. The food was amazing too, I liked the variety and \"DIY feast\" concept. I would recommend the fish and the pork belly. I also heard they make their own mayo in house. The interior is cute too."}
{"text":"From a German citizen I must say I was very disappointed.  I ordered the Bavarian plate which was a disgrace to German food on a few levels. First, it's overpriced at $55. Worth $40 I'd say.  -To start off the schweinshaxe (pork hock) was primarily fat, while fat is always good to have there was simply too much on there. I would say this is the best part of the dish though.  -The sauerkraut was not good.  -The weisswurst was ok actually I say equal to the schweinshaxe actually. -The potatoes and beets were pretty good.  -Lastly the pretzel... As a Bavarian myself, these pretzels tasted quite poor. I was disappointed this happened.   The atmosphere was nice yes, but the waiters were not. One gave me an aggressive tone which I didnt like. One guy with an Australian accent was kind as he took my order but I believe someone else took over after him.   I was not asked once if I wanted a refill for my drink or anything. The customer service was awful. The only time the waiter came again was when I turned around and waived at him for the check after waiting an entire dinner with no service after getting our food.   I think this could be a really great place but improvements need to be made."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I stared off with the God Complex beer. It was so good, light but strong  Our waitress was sweet. As a server she did everything right. We got the pork belly, served crispy on the outside nice and juicy on the inside. Homemade pickles were alright, they lacked a lot of flavor of other homemade pickles I've had. And they were mainly cauliflower not pickles? The beef tenderloin was talked down. I left wanting more and more. The waitress said it was good but didn't left me a little concerned I should have gotten something else after I ordered. No, I made a good choice it was so moist and the flavors were booming. I just wanted to order another one. The other side we got was Brussels sprouts, they were very good. Still tasted light, but had really good flavor. We wanted to go back here for another beer then next night. I just really love this place. I will have to come back when I visit Canada again!"}
{"text":"This is become one of my favourite place to have german food. The environment is amazing with good Beer collection, food and customer service. The only thing be ready for a little greasy food which I don't mind every once in a while. Definitely will go back and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for half-price draughts for their anniversary and it was worth in the sense the beers were good and cheap - so very worth the time. Between two people, we had shared 3 of the $5 small plates and the portions are fairly tiny. You are not going to get full, but it makes a good additional side snack for your boozy nights."}
{"text":"One of the best things I loved about Germany was the great beer, atmosphere and bar food. When I heard that there was a German beer hall here, I definitely wanted to go. Unfortunately it was pretty far, and took me about a year to get here (what's with great restaurants and bars being so hard to reach?).    It was a bit of a wait. We came here around 7pm but had to wait around an hour a half because we didn't make reservations (Make reservations people!).    Beer  Anyways, I liked the Schneider Aventinus beer. It was a good dark beer and I thought it was the best one I've tried. I didn't like the unusual beer, but I cannot recall which one it was. Lots of different beers on selection. I'd definitely recommend.     Food  We ordered Octoberfest platter as well as the Schweinhaxe. The Schweinhaxe was huge. I did not expect that. The skin was so crispy and the meat was great. It can be a bit fatty but it just comes with the territory.  The Oktoberfest platter was equally awesome. They had great sauces to dip the sausages in. We ordered way too much for 3 people. We could've ordered the Bavaria theoretically but the Weissvurst was not as good as any of the other sausages included in the Oktoberfest. Our waitress was very helpful and provided a lot of good recommendations. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Why did I have to find  out about this place AFTER my trip to Germany.  After having some dope-ass schweinshaxe IN Germany it was exciting to see this! Everything felt familiar. All the way to the white bricks and the dim as fuck lights in there (maybe make it not as dim haha. After a few pints and the loud music, things get disorienting) Whether it be the way the Germans raise their pigs to the way they marinate/roast it/fry it/whatever. Toronto was not even close to achieving the same mind blowing flavour that they can. The slaw that was underneath the actual hock was hard for me to eat. The hock it self was way too fatty and not enough meat.   Had their sauerkraut fritters there and they are TINY. Not worth it for the price $5,60. I also had their hunter sandwich with their roast pork belly. Now THATS something worth talking about.  I know I've only had one visit there but I know I won't get anything other than their platters with friends (just for the grandiose fun of it and communal style sharing) and their sandwiches.  When you say Prost. Make sure to give eye contact to whomever's glass your clinking with. Otherwise it's 7 years bad sex!"}
{"text":"This place projects a really fun vibe for an evening gathering. The right mix of hipster vibes, delicious German food, wide range of craft beers, and washrooms where you can solo boogie down. It's got something for everyone to enjoy!  We were a party of 8 and fit comfortably at a nice long table inside by the large window. It's got the mood lighting on for the dinner crowd and the music is the perfect background complement. You can actually hear each other talk without screaming over the top of the music and have lost your voice halfway through the night.  The craft beer selection is quite wide ranging and everybody can find something that would tickle their palette. Otherwise, they have a very robust cocktail and drink menu. I ended up starting with a pumpkin spiced manhattan which was just terrific.  The feast platters are the best value on the menu. They offer four different types of feast platters and they all kind of give you a focus on different parts of the menu. If you love wurst then get the Oktoberfest while if you have a craving for schnitzel then the Vienna should be calling your name. The Choucroute highlights pork belly and some wursts while vegetarians in the crowd can enjoy the Kreuzberg.  The Vienna was calling my name!  At first I thought we had to pick one of chicken, pork, halloumi, or portobello schnitzel and to my surprise, you get them ALL! That's what I call winning. I think my favourite was the halloumi and pork schnitzel. The pork was really tender with a nice crunchy crust and the halloumi cheese was salty and gooey.  The sides that accompanied the platter were delightful unto themselves. The brussel sprouts had this nice sear and flavour and the spatula was just super-rich and creamy.  We ordered 3 platters for the 8 of us and it was just enough for these hungry carnivores.  I think the platter can feed 3 people to satisfaction without being guilty of over-eating.  Of course, no visit to Otto Bierhalle is complete without visiting their bathrooms to enjoy the one-person dance party you can experience.  Just hit the big button and you can wiggle & jiggle to your heart's content. Each bathroom has a different theme which makes it the most unique bathroom experience ever!"}
{"text":"I came to Otto's Bierhalle for dinner to have a huge German feast! With so many meats and beer to choose from, it was hard to decide what to get. I wanted to try it all!   They have 24 beers on tap just on the menu with new additions listed on the wall. My favorite of all the ones I had was the Ottakringer Vienna Original Lager, which had a great taste and was super smooth. My second favorite was the Hofbrau Dunkel, which is a darker lager that was also incredibly refreshing and smooth.   We ordered the Bavaria Feast ($55) which comes with a Schweinshaxe (pork hock), a single Wiesswurst sausage, couple sauerkraut fritters, a pile of sauerkraut, potato salad, beet salad, grilled veggies, pickles, and a mound of french fries. Enough food to feed three people with a good appetite.   The pork hock is slowly cooked for 24 hours in a sous-vide water bath before being deep-fried for 10 min to give it that super crispy outer skin. I've had pork hocks in the past from other restaurants that were incredibly salty and the meat tough. But the pork hock at Otto's was incredibly tender and not salty at all. The pork goes so well with the three different types of mustard that it comes with. However, the next time I order this, I may ask them to deep fry it a little less as I found some parts of the skin was a little overcooked and slightly bitter. I was surprised when they told me they deep fry it for 10 min as the meat itself has already been fully cooked with the sous-vide. Perhaps some people like the charred taste, but personally I prefer a crisp skin that is not burnt, so I think 5 min in the fryer would have been just perfect. Still, the inside meat was super moist and tender and was so good!   The wiesswurst sausage was also very delicious. Not salty at all like most sausages. Very delicate but still incredibly tasty. Again, goes so well with the three different types of mustard.  In addition to the Bavaria Feast, we ordered a side of Rouladen ($10). It's a beef tenderloin rolled and stuffed with smoked cured beef, house pickles, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and mustard. As good as it was, I don't think it was quite worth the price for four small pieces. Good to try, but wouldn't order it again.   The service here is amazing too. Super friendly servers really know their menu and their beers. Very helpful in assisting us with the ordering and giving us some background on the food.   The washroom has a button that when you press turns the lights off and starts playing music with psychedelic black light. Entertaining, but some people waste time playing with the button rather than doing their business, causing lineups to form outside.   Overall, I had an amazing dinner experience here. If you like meat and beer (and who doesn't), this is definitely a place worth checking out! Would definitely come back to try out some of their other menu items and beers."}
{"text":"Oh dear. So behind on reviews. I guess it's time to catch up!  I came a few weeks ago on a mini food crawl. I came alone. I've been planning this trip for a while now, seeing as Otto's has been on my bookmarks list for longer than it should have been. I could never make it when they were actually open...  THEY HAVE AFTERNOON SPECIALS NOW! Yes! I didn't want to do a whole meal by myself, and I didn't just want a tiny side, but they have specials from Mon-Fri from 5-7pm. They call it their funf menu. No, I didn't spell that wrong. Apparently, funf is 5 from German. That one I learned from a friend afterwards.  I got their mini brotzeit with cheese, assorted smoked meats, pickled veggies, and sliced bread.  It was a fantastic snack. A bit of mustard would have made it even better. I should have asked for some..."}
{"text":"We ordered the Schnitzel and Waffles platter.  I love the way it was beautifully presented.  The food was very tasty.  The chicken schnitzel was very moist. I love how you can assemble your own food so I made my Own chicken and waffles and topped it was the delicious gravy and syrup and it was the bomb!  I loved the vibrant orange colour of the egg yolk from the poached eggs.  I would definitely go back.  I love the hanging plants and the vibe of the environment.  Highly recommend making brunch reservations."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for brunch for a party of 7 on a Saturday. We were seated promptly and received good service.  We ordered 2 platters (schnitzel & waffle and the neukolln which seems to be the veggie option) and it did take time for the food to come out. Our server came by to apologize several times before coming over one last time saying their manager felt bad about the wait and offered us 30% off our bill. We had noticed the wait for food, but had not complained to any staff about it, so we really appreciated this preemptive gesture!  The platters were delicious and we devoured everything! From the poached and soft boiled eggs, to the various schnitzels and the beet salad...YUM. I would definitely return.  Decor and presentation of food also made for good instagram pics if you're into that!  Don't forget to push the button in the washroom for something fun. :)"}
{"text":"Otto's Bierhalle is such a great time! We came here as a group of 6 and ordered two feasts, a pretzel cheese dip and an abundance of beer.   The ambiance is fun but not too loud. The food is extremely tasty and of a large variety. The heaviness of the meat platters was nicely offset by the tartness of the pickles and salads. The pork shank is quite something if you are a fan of pork skin and fat.   The 6 of us easily cleaned up both feast and were just the right amount of full. I simple cannot wait to come back"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had in a very long time at a restaurant and the best place I've eaten at in Toronto. The ham hock is an absolute must try, the skin is so crispy and delicious it's absolutely decadent, very similar to the most delicious crust pork belly. Get the charcuterie board and the Bavarian feast and you will be all set, more than enough food for two people. Also, they had a wonderful beer selection, the Schneider Hopfenweisse is an absolute must try on the menu, one of the better beers I've had in a long time. The atmosphere and service is also top notch. Cannot wait to go back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was delicious. Best potato salad I've had. The sauerkraut fritters were great and the portion of pork belly was succulent and fatty in the right places. Cherry cider was mediocre. Other than that, would highly reccommend."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 8 people. We were quickly seated after a few moments at the bar. The night ambiance is very different than the day pictures described on their website. I enjoyed it.   We got the Schweinshaxe, Brussel Sprouts, and Sauerkraut Fritter w/ a Donut beer and Hefeweizen.   Schweinshaxe was delicious. A crispy delicious pork that easily feeds 2 people. I loved the excessiveness of it. I had seen someone eating one in Germany over this past summer and loved having the opportunity to have one myself.   The Brussel Sprouts were sweet. The amount was just right for the two of us. The Sauerkraut Fritters were light and tasty.  The Donut beer was a spontaneous decision. Right before I made it I was tasting a few different beers with the bartender we had. It was the right choice. We followed it with the Hefeweizen for what I'd imagine a classic German bier.   Great environment filled with friendly hosts, delicious food, and tasty beer. All of my friends had a great time during our dinner."}
{"text":"Best in class Great job and kudos to everyone involved   Even as a man of taste I sometimes must get as explicit as this: the bathrooms are even best in class.   All around Great job!"}
{"text":"I've been there 4 times in less than 1 month. Even though I know the food will be great when I go, I still leave more content than I expected. Music/atmosphere is fantastic. Best place for a casual dinner with 4-6 friends."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.  I visited for Saturday brunch. The menu was short with few options. I ordered the vegetarian Benedict. The avocado was a bit hard was not fully ripe. The salad dressing had zero flavour it was like eating raw arugula. So bitter I  could not eat it.  I also got a mimosas which tasted good.   The servers were nice. Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"My husband is from Germany and has pretty high expectations for all the German style beer halls that have opened up in the city. Happy to say that he approved of this one. They have a nice selection of German beers and local craft beers. The vibe was great and we really enjoyed it. The David Hasselhoff videos projected on the wall were a funny touch. My only complaint is that the food was too salty. We ordered a pretzel with fondue and one of the platters to share. They were good but the salt was too much."}
{"text":"Guten tag! I'll just copy and paste what some of the other reviewers have said: \"Bring your hipster friends here!\" Lolz.  Otto's Bierhalle is located in the Great Hall building, and brings the German beer garden together with hip Queen West-ness. Its trendy decor (be sure to press the big button above the toilet!) and loud fun vibe keeps those empty glasses filled--of which they have a ridiculously wide selection of German imported and local craft brews.  They do take reservations, so beat the busyness even if it's just a couple spots at a communal table.  You can choose a sharable platter of selections (see under 'Feasts' on the menu), or lose yourself on your own meal package that includes German meat dishes and sausages--everything comes in small baking trays. The schnitzel ($6, and I had the pork) is crispy and firm, but may come across as small (at 4 Oz) if you are more used to Schnitzel Queen-sized monsters. The spätz and cheese bowl was mac-n-cheese kind of comforting. Among other things I can recall, we had a cheese-and-char plate ($16), that looked disappointing at first but had an interesting mix of cheeses (why are some people afraid of goat and blue cheese?).  There isn't much in terms of anything German in Toronto right now, but I guess this new place is a big bang start. A tad pricey, but much interesting fun to be had without any stuck-up hip attitude. (It'd be suitably hilarious if they step up the hip German-ness by playing some upbeat techno or German industrial music, though it's so loud here you can barely hear the music anyways. Lolz)  [TTC: die Straßenbahn 501 to Dovercourt Ave]"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork hoc feast with extra schnitzel, and was not disappointed! Shared between a double date was enough food to go around without feeling stuffed. I definitely will return here. I think one feast platter would be satisfying for two persons however depending on appetite. And not many restaurants serve this cut of meat.   Crispy exterior skin with a tender cooked to the bone offering pairs great with a beer. Perfectly cooked vegetables give a refreshing diversion to a meat centric cuisine. The spätzle side was quite good something that made me want more of it. (almost like a Mac and cheese dish)  Overall a great experience, enjoyed trying this German cuisine spot; not to mention, a great place to get a Beer. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Meh,  This place seemed interesting when my friend suggested it as a dinner night.  The interior is strange with unfinished stucco type walls and ceilings. Lot's of sitting room.. if they let you sit together. My group of at the time 6 soon to be more was told we couldn't sit together even though half the restaurant was empty. After about 10 minutes they invited us to come join a large table to accomidate everyone.. whodathunkit!  The food was interesting, I got a schnitzel on a bun with a tiny child size bowl of grilled veggies. The schnitzel was good but the bun was gooped up with a ton of mayo which I ended up wiping off cuz mayo is gross.  Needless to say I was still hungry after my meal.  One of the people in my group had even worse service. The kitchen gave her meal to someone else, and she had to wait and watch the rest of us finish our meal before she got hers. There was also a mixup on what she was served and thankfully her meal was 'comped.  This place needs to get their act together.  1.5/5"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound so harsh but this place seems like a wannabe authentic German place opened up by hipster Canadians but it works in Toronto because there is no real competition nearby. Yes, there are German/Austrian dishes on the menu, but better Spätzle can be had in Etobicoke (middle of nowhere), Schnitzel doesn't even have air bubbles between the meat and the bread coating (to the owners: if you are reading this please watch some videos on YouTube on 'how to make authentic wienerschnitzel'). For what you get, it's expensive and doesn't remind me of Germany but I can see how people would think this place is cool. As for beer: $9.50 for a bottle of erdinger weissbier is a very \"stolz\" price. Maybe that's a reasonable price for queen st. hipster standards, I don't know. In closing I seriously question people who gave this place 5 stars.."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for awhile (actually more hype about the bathrooms) I decided I needed to check it out.  I went with 6 other people so definitely make a reservation (before 8pm, after 8pm no reservations are taken) as it gets packed.    The beer menu is extensive with beers you most likely have never heard of.  The food menu is curated to go well with the beers.  You can build your own plates with schnitzels, wursts, pretzels, Spatz and cheese etc.  customizable to what you and your group wants which is great.  We ordered a few of the wursts, Spatz/cheese, beef tenderloin and the Otto fries.  It did take awhile for the food to come out but everything was hot and tasty.  No complaints from anyone in the group.  The ambiance and decor are really nice - old school, charming :)  And 100% check out the bathrooms and press the button!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch. This place was packed. And luckily we had reservation.   For food: We had the two most famous platters for party of 5. It was way more than enough. However, the food is lack of flavour and I definitely won't come again for brunch.   The washroom is worth the visit tho."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Otto's. This place was just as great as I'd hoped. We ordered the Bratwurst platter, equipped with lots of sausages, fries, sauerkraut, coleslaw and pickled veggies with lots of fun aiolis, mustards and dips.  We added on a side of potato salad that was just as good everything on our plates. This platter easily fed 3 people and the beers were super reasonably priced. When divided, with drinks, our bills came to $20. Which is pretty damn incredible for Toronto. I'll definitely be back, but this time - for brunch."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and man are we glad we did! A great selection of beers and the food was all AMAZING. Their pork belly hunter sandwich stole the show!! It was crispy, savoury, and rich! The hot kransky with mustard was a close second fav. Of the night. And if you're feeling something homey, their spätzle and cheese was al dante and the right amount of creaminess. Everything was excellent, really."}
{"text":"Trendy modern take on a German style beer hall, located on west queen west near ossington. My initial impression was that the interior decor was hip and really aesthetic. Plants hanging from the ceilings, wooden tables with benches, nice tiled floor, dimly lit with subtle lights of different colors.  Amazing selection of great beers- not too pricey overall. Ottos also has amazing dishes to share for a late night snack. Great place to go at night for a drink out, more relaxed but gets noisy.  HOWEVER, they also serve brunch. And it is amazing. They have platters served on treys that are for sharing; amazing poached eggs, array of sausages, potatoes, fruit, etc. perfect for nice photos and to share with large groups. They also have vegetarian options.  Highly recommend trying for both dinner and brunch."}
{"text":"Food is pricey vs the quality.  Cheese platter isn't great. Pretzel isn't great. Happy I never got the sharing platter.  Beer is great however.  Service was alright. Washrooms are fun."}
{"text":"Fantastic time at Otto's Great selection of cocktails and beer, food was delicious and platter style ideal for a table of 8 people. Atmosphere was great and loved the design. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is now my new favourite brunch place! The food is not only Instagram-worthy but actually so freaking delicious! I'm one to love eating family style so I love the Feast trays that Otto's Bierhalle serves. Not only do you get to try a bit of everything, but you get to share with your beloved friends and family. It's so fun sharing and listening to everyone squeal and giggle about the amazing food. I've been here two weekends in a row to try the brunch and then dinner and was blown away both times. The service is extremely friendly and I had a blast both times I was here! Don't forget to check out the washrooms cause they have a surprise for you in there ;)"}
{"text":"The food is tasty but too salty. The place seems pretentious. I came in there once and tbe hostest was very unfriendly- told us there was an hour wait and the place was half empty. Get real"}
{"text":"Booked a reservation for a Sunday brunch with my girlfriend. I misremembered the timing of the reservation and arrived half an hour late, thankfully they still had enough room to seat us.  We don't usually order alcohol for brunch, but seeing the other tables around us all with goblets of beer, I couldn't help but also order a watermelon wheat beer that I saw on the take across from us.  It was very refreshing, lightly flavored, almost like a soft drink - perfect for brunch.  We ordered the \"Full Otto\" to share - four slices of bread lightly drizzled in olive oil, six poached eggs covered with hollandaise, three sausages, two slices of perfectly seared pork belly, a mound of potatoes and yams, and a tasty baby spinach salad. There was also a couple tiny pieces of fruit  We agreed that the seared pork belly was the most delicious pork dish we've had at any restaurant in recent memory. Every inch of their surface was crisp and intensely flavorful. You could pair each bite with the berry sauce, apple sauce, or mustard.  The poached eggs with hollandaise sauce were also perfectly done - tender whites, creamy yoke. We didn't manage to finish all six of them, but I really wish I could have.   The potatoes were the only disappointing piece on the plate. Wasn't very well salted, no sauce, it may be useful as filler if it were three people sharing the plate, but with so much other delicious items, it went mostly untouched.   The servers were very friendly, and attentive when coffee or beers ran low.  We will definitely be back. The pork belly has me very curious how delicious their other meats might be. Would also not mind trying the other beers on their extensive menu"}
{"text":"Wide selection of beers, and delicious sharing platters.  Open space with communal tables.  Fast and friendly service.  We had the Oktoberfest which came with all four types of their sausages, sauerkraut, slaw fries and pickles.  All were delicious, the slaw was surprisingly delicious and bright tasting with fresh herbs.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Imagine heading to a new restaurant for dinner at 5pm on a Sunday when the restaurant is set to open. Next, imagine your surprise when the line extends around the corner of the building, and around the corner after that too. You would likely be standing in line like me, with your two other guests thinking WOW! This place must be amazeballs; and getting pretty excited about your latest Yelp find. Now, imagine the embarrassment and devastation when you realize you missed the door to the actual restaurant and you've been standing in line (and nearly got to the front) before you realized you were in line for some concert that has nothing to do with the restaurant; and for which you have no tickets. Cue slinking out of there like nothing is wrong and you knew this all along.   Annnyways! Once we found the right door there was no wait, it wasn't too busy, and we got a small table to ourselves. There are several other longer communal tables as well. It is a bright and spacious place. They were playing Frankenstein on the wall, with a projector I'm guessing. The bathrooms are also worth venturing to. Push the button on the wall!   The service was an easy 5 stars-- very friendly and super helpful when navigating the menu. Loved how the bartender came to the tables to serve the drinks.   We shared the Vienna platter between three of us. We had MORE than enough food; and my boyfriend and I both commented it would have been too much for just the two of us. I would highly recommend the platter; and next time I would also consider just ordering a whole bunch of the sides. Some of my faves: Sauerkraut fritters, pretzel with grainy mustard, roasted brussels sprouts, spatz and cheese, house made pickles. Who am I kidding...I loved it all!   Not a beer drinker so can't help there- but my boyfriend and his friend both loved the beers they tried (can't remember the names though). I like sweet ciders and really enjoyed the Duxbury cider. I also tried the West Ave and hated it. It was flavorless and super dry.   Dessert:  Black Forest dacquoise. It was very good - I actually would have been ok with just the homemade, rich chocolate mousse and sour cherries. These were phenomenal. The actual cake left something to be desired.   Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and we got the Oktoberfest platter and also the pork belly. My first comment would be that although the menu says the Oktoberfest is good for 3 people, when we got that and the pork belly it was just barely sufficient for 2 guys. Quality of the food was pretty good. You get a good variety of meats and mustards to go with them, as well as a generous amount of fries and slaw and sauerkraut.  I wasn't as wowed by the quality of food as I thought I would be but it was still a good experience overall (service was great) and I'd give the place another shot to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Otto's is a great new addition in West Queen West. The city is definitely lacking great German restaurants and places to get German beers, and Otto's does a decent job.  It can get pretty busy so you may need to put your name down and head to the dog and bear for your first pint. The food is pricey for the most part (sausages as much as $8!?) but the pretzels offer some good value and are very tasty.  The beer selection is nice but I find the prices on the high end for a bar and pints that look less than 20oz.  The washrooms are definitely the star of the show, each one offers a different \"experience\". Very cool light shows and even a photo booth.  I personally have never been to Germany other than the airport, but I assume they are going for a more modern German style, with dance music and neon lights for ambience.   Overall there is definitely room for improvement but not a bad place to grab a pint or two with friends. A little too pricey and gimmicky to make this a regular bar to go to for me though."}
{"text":"Three words: Hipster German Fare.  While hipster and German fare don't usually go hand in hand, it's becoming a thing now that Otto's Bierhalle opened in Queen West. This restaurant has a friendly communal vibe with communal tables and bar seating for easy mingling with friends and strangers. Menu items all sound delicious and all served on a tray to share,  I came with 3 other people and we ordered a bunch of items to share. Here's the verdict: 1. Three cheese fondue and pretzels - B great fondue, pretzels were fine but nothing special, and the pretzel to fondue portion was lacking. There was hardly enough pretzel to go around.  2. Brussel sprouts - A I loved the way they roasted it.  3. Saucerkraut - A for deliciousness! 4. Pork Belly - B+ for tasty but a bit too fatty 5. Pork Hock - A and this is a must order! No German feast is complete without pork hock! Seriously! It's a staple in Germany. And their version with crispy skin and tender meat with a balance of fatty and lean is wonderful.  6. Chicken Schnitzel - A because it was well made and super tasty.  7. Wurst - get any of them. Honestly I can't remember which one we ordered but it was good. Seriously, get all four.   We also enjoyed the drinks. Seriously so many options! We weren't sure what to get so we asked the server for suggestions. They can also make any mocktail you like or ask them to surprise you :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a good friend's birthday and it was definitely a place worth trying.  When we ordered, the waitress completely underestimated how much we would eat (told us to order 3 platters to share amongst 8 people).  Yeah no...we were no H&M skinny hipsters...well some of us may look it but definitely, we eat more.  We ended up ordering 5 platters with some extra sides.  They were also nice enough to cut a cake for us that the friend's bf had brought.    Overall, it is worth going to try once.  Hipster portions, delicious food."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal, beers are fantastic and the atmosphere is perfect for 2 or a group. Arrive early because portion sizes are big! One of my favourite spots"}
{"text":"Why is the platter for 3 people ?I guess if you are on a date with an extra person this makes sense. But for 2 people its way too much food or for 4 it's not enough. Beer selection was extensive and music was not too overbearing with great selections. The washroom experience reminded us of better days when toronto had cool underground parties and programming. Please scale the platter for groups of 2."}
{"text":"Wow!! We had an amazing dinner at Otto's last night!  We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation but were able to get seated right away. Seating is a combination of communal and individual tables (some high top and some regular). Our server was warm and very friendly, and offered great suggestions/explanations of the menu.   The beer selection is awesome and prices reasonable (based on area of the city and the fact many of the beers are European imports). The food was fantastic, and phenomenal value! Three of us split the Vienna feast ($45), plus added one pretzel and one bratwurst. This platter had great variety - 4 types of schnitzel (pork, chicken, halloumi cheese, portobello mushroom) as well as a good selection of sides (Brussels sprouts, slaw, salad, pickles, spaetzle). It came with lemons, mustard, and aioli. Quality of all the meats was better than I expected (very good) and I liked literally everything on the platter. Food came out very quickly, which was appreciated as we were very hungry!   Interior of the restaurant is very nice - polished concrete floor, Edison bulbs plus other interesting light fixtures, and tons of plants, including on walls and hanging from the ceiling. There was something interesting to see no matter which direction you looked! Bathrooms are all individual, unisex rooms, the locks didn't seem to work very well (my friend and I both had trouble with them) but this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. I also found the restaurant a bit loud, but it was Saturday night at a popular Queen West restaurant so higher volume is to be expected.   Overall a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you like German food, including sausages, French fries, sauerkraut, and beer this is the place for you. Queen St West Vibe, full of a hipster crowd of friends out for a night on the town. It's a cool vibe with yummy food, not sure if they have any calorie wise options but if you're looking for a healthy snack this is not the place for you- go on your 'cheat day' and order a share plate!!  Sounds funny but make sure you check out their disco washrooms"}
{"text":"A lot of the value, for me, of Otto's Bierhalle comes from the factors surrounding the food.   My friend and I ordered the Oktoberfest platter - a good amount of food for the money, complete with 3 different types of mustard. While the sausages were good, I cannot say that they were the best I've had. On quality of food alone, I would give it 3/5 stars.   But Otto's is just a fun restaurant, and I think that deserves its place, even if the food isn't an A+. The disco button in the bathroom exemplifies this. I had a few drinky-poos, leading to an uncontrollable flow of pee.   This meant that I had the good fortune to try out different bathrooms, and had a blast doing so. There were different lights and different music!!   Adding to the fun: Otto's has a good beer selection, so there's lots to try out. I don't even like beer that much but had fun picking out what to drink.   TLDR; good vibes, decent food, good beer selection, fun time. Worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Easily the best new spot. If you have ever been to Berlin...and wanted to bring it home...well here you have it. Top notch service....top shelf food and an incredible choice of beer.  Amazing place...don't forget to check out their Kensington spot OTTOS DONER (http://ottosdoner.com)"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, lively ambience, good on prices.  Food a bit lacking in taste and pairing.  Had better at other German places."}
{"text":"I first saw Otto's Bierhall show up on my instagram (the one time ad targeting worked!) about a week before my husband and I came out to Toronto. I was wowed by the amazing looking platters of goodness and immediately went to Yelp to bookmark it. When my husband and I were figuring out where to eat for brunch I immediately shouted \"OTTO'S!\" We were not disappointed.  We obviously had to get one of the platters, even though they said they feed 3-4 and there were only two of us. We love a good challenge, though. Every platter looked amazing, from some of the meat heavier options with brats and such, but we I love a salty/sweet combo so we got the schnitzel and waffles platter. It came with 6 poached eggs with hollandaise, a salad, waffles, maple syrup and gravy for dipping and 3 different types of schnitzel of your choosing. We did pork, chicken and halloumi cheese--all three were outstanding. The cheese was a nice surprise of salty goodness.   Most of the seating is communal and they save a lot of the big tables for larger parties. Despite there being plenty of tables we did have to wait a bit since there wasn't a two top available for just the pair of us. Finally a larger group sat down and had two seats at the end available so we got a seat. The wait wasn't a big deal, though, as we sat at the bar and got some coffee to start. We could have enjoyed our entire meal there as well but we thought the platter might be easier if we sat across from each other vs. side by side. This ended up being a good choice.   The beer options here are ridiculous. My husband was nursing a bit of a headache so he didn't opt for one and lamented the decision the rest of the day. He wants to come back for the beer list alone. I'd definitely come back for brunch again and the dinner menu looked just as amazing as brunch. Maybe we'll just post up here all day and eat and drink from brunch to dinner!"}
{"text":"I think people need to stress a little less in general about places being \"authentic\". We get it; you're worldly. But this place doesn't claim to be authentic anywhere I've seen, and good food can be just good food.   It's definitely German ish, and really tasty. Comfort deep fried type tasty. The shared \"feasts\" say they're for 3-4 I think, but we had two feasts for four people and nearly tackled it all. And there is serious consideration to vegetarian options, which I haven't found typical in German restaurants (who doesn't love deep fried halloumi?).   Some German beers, yep. But, like in Germany (and on their website) it's \"local and imported beers\". Not cheap, but nothing different than the rest of the neighborhood.   Nice people, clean place, nice vibe. Hipster, sure. But those kids are saving us and all our previously unwanted real estate :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to brunch.  Food: I love that you can eat family style, where you share food from the same platter/tray. I usually get the Full Otto because of the variety of tasty food you get in it (sausage, pork belly, poached eggs etc) . Ive tried the waffle and schnitzel before and found it subpar and wouldn't really recommend it. I found it to be tasteless (if if werent for the gravy) and the schnitzel a little dry.   Drinks: great selection of beer on tap!! (It's a bierhalle after all)  Interior: it's a really cute space with lots of Scandinavian/Nordic vibes. The bathrooms are a lot of fun.   Service: really nice and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for after work drinks and dinner.   Service (5 stars): We had reservation for 10 people, but ended up having 13.  The people working there were accommodating and helped us get extra chairs.  They mentioned they were going to move us to a bigger table if one opened up, but by the time it opened up we were already comfortably cozy.  Food (5 stars):   Me and a friend shared the Vienna food platter.  With a beer each, and tax and tip the cost was around $50.  A few other friends got different platters, but Vienna was definitely the best one.    Ambiance (5 stars): A mixture between a german beer hall and a classic restaurant.  A bit more cozy than a beer hall.  The place gets pretty loud so if you want to have a long talk not the best place, but good for groups just casually catching up.  For a surprise: check out the washroom and press the big button."}
{"text":"Gord and I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of Otto's Bierhalle and that happened on Thursday.  We checked it out tonight.  It was jammed so we sat at the bar.  They have a great selection of beer on tap.  German beer on the left side of the list ... local craft beer on the right side  We ordered some pretzels ... they came with three different kinds of mustard for dipping.  They were yummy!   All the staff was friendly.  We had a great chat with Adrian ... he definitely knows his beer!    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I were rating this solely on my own personal experience, this would be 10 stars. Otto's Bierhalle is one of my favorite restaurants for either brunch (you can actually make a reservation here) or dinner. They're food is amazing and I have yet to meet someone who has a bad meal here. Everyone I have suggested it to has loved it as well and I've taken countless friends and family who were all equally pleased.   However, it is the friends and family that I have taken with me that have kept me from giving Otto's 5 stars. The thing is, though their food is delicious and service is always friendly, they can't accommodate very much. For instance, my mother is someone who doesn't like a runny yolk. Personally I love it but she doesn't and when we went for brunch she asked for her eggs to be hard poached. Otto's cooks their eggs sous vide style which means for me they are perfectly soft poached every time but they can't cook them more for people like my mother. Or my father asked to substitute tomatoes instead of the potatoes on his dish and they told him they didn't have enough tomatoes in the kitchen to do this. They did offer to give him more salad.  TL:DR: Otto's inability to accommodate substitution holds me back from giving them the whole 5 stars but if you aren't someone who makes substitutions, the food is AMAZING"}
{"text":"We need more Berlin themed bier halls! These guys also have ottos doner. Between that and this spot, it's so obvious these guys have done their research. Everything is super authentic. They put a lot of care into the menu and the vibe.  Update July 2nd: I had an amazing brunch here! Didn't even realize they had brunch. But sure glad I found it!! Got the benny breakfast sandwich. Pork belly was my favorite but I tried the schnitzel too and it was Great. Avacado and beat salad was super creamy and had a perfect little kick to it. Curried beans also a good choice.  Ceasar was good but could of had a little more garnish ;)"}
{"text":"Coming to Otto's bierhalle is a reality check of just how old I'm getting.  Our party of 7 came here on a Friday night for dinner around 6:30. It started off pretty calm and cool with us talking at our normal voice level.  Then 8pm rolls around and BAM, this place was packed with younger and more energetic crowd which we then found ourselves screaming at the top of our lungs just to carry on a conversation.  We quickly wrapped up dinner and move the conversation to a quieter cafe while the youngins line up at the door.   Despite the loudness (which isn't a bad thing), the food and spread was fantastic. You have a choice of choosing their preset menu or make your own. We opt for the DIY plate choosing 2 wursts, chicken schnitzel, Brussel spouts, pretzel, and sauerkraut.  We really enjoyed the schnitzel, it was lightly battered, crispy and very tasty.  We also upgraded one of our wurst to curry with fries for extra $4 which I was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the curry wurst i had in Berlin (so yummy), this one lacked the curry flavour.  I was hoping for something similar but Perhaps it's different here.  We also tried some of the items my friends ordered and everything was great. I'm not a pork lover so I didn't try the pork belly or hock but everyone said it was yummy.   Overall a great experience with delicious food, I would come back but most likely during brunch hours when the noise level is a bit on the tame side."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Queen Street West and Shaw St. The area was pretty cool with a lot of diversity and ethnic foods. No free parking in the direct vicinity, but paid parking lots were available nearby.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Staff were wonderful. Our server was kind enough to check on our table when she noticed the chef took a little longer than anticipated to prepare our order, she also introduced everything on the platters when the food came, and checked up on us multiple times during our meal!  [DÉCOR] - 5/5  Fun and comfortable ambiance with wooden benches and tables. Great for groups, and quite large for a restaurant near the downtown core.   [QUALITY] - 5/5 Premium-quality meats and high-quality vegetables. All items were seasoned very well, and came with flavourful sauces on the side!   [ORDER] - 5/5 - Choucroute Alsace Feast - $49.00: pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth. Bratwurst sausage was grilled very well and flavourful. Brussel sprouts were seasoned and pan-fried to perfection! Grilled veggies, potato salad, and house pickles complemented the meats very well as it added a hint of lightness to the meal.   - Bavaria Feast - $59.00: schweinshaxe (pork hock) was so crispy on the outside and had the perfect amount of fat to melt in my mouth without clogging my arteries. House fries were cut into small pieces, which made the outer layer of the fries extra crunchy and delicious. Sauerkraut, potato salad, beet salad and grilled vegetables were all flavoured very well and complemented everything on the whole platter.   [OVERALL] - 5/5 A premium-quality German dining experience. The food, ambiance, and service were phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this place for an authentic feast!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for a friend's bday and she had wanted to come here for their beer menu. There were 7 of us and we were seated immediately because we had reservation. the place is dimly lit with fluorescent bulbs and vines from the ceiling - because of this it gave it a romantic vibe. as well, each toilet stall had a button that when pressed, the lights changed into disco or black lights with music - kinda like a mini club   i got the cowbell belgian eggnog ale - and considering the fact that I'm not much of a beer person, i enjoyed drinking it. it wasn't too bitter and it had a rich creamy finish.  we all shared the 3 cheese fondue with pretzels - came with 4 big pieces of pretzels. in my opinion, this dish was very salty. a lot of kosher salt on the pretzels alone and the cheeses used just exacerbated the saltiness of it.  for mains, i got the pork belly with apple compote which had been soud vide until crispy +  a beet salad served with pieces of goat cheese + their own version of mac & cheese. everything was so delicious i have nothing bad to say! the portions seemed small initially but they filled me up. i liked the fact that the prices were very decent there"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... but I was pretty disappointed in a few things during my last visit...  SERVICE/AMBIANCE: Extremely slow service. Food came an hour late...everything was cold by the time it was served. Very poor sound-proofing, I was literally shouting to the person across me on a Sunday morning.... the chairs/benches were extremely uncomfortable... we asked if we can switch from the communal table to one of those 4 people tables.. the waiter said sorry those are for parties of 3-4... we were like ok no worries...but no one was seated in those empty 4 seats table after-all. The only thing I liked about the spot was the decor and lighting... and that's about it.  BEER: Beware... beers are more expensive than any regular spots in the neighborhood.. and the beer selection was just average.  FOOD: food was nothing too special... just some over-priced greasy sausages... schnitzels or waffles you can probably make at home... you can probably experience better elsewhere with that kind of money.  Conclusion: I don't think I'll be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Would be a 4 but our waitress made it a 5. Zoey Deschanel vibes so helpful kind and courteous. The spatz and cheese was very delicious and plenty of beer selection. Claire L you are the cutest sweetest waitress in the world. I hope the universe gives you all that you desire! This place is honored to have you to work here!"}
{"text":"Located in the Arts and Design district, this establishment is a trendy, hip take on German pub fare. They have a pretty large tap selection (though it's not especially unique) of German style pilsners, wheat (wit), IPA and lagers that is just big enough to give you that comfortable sense of choice, without leaving you scrambling to pick when the friendly serving staff arrive to take the orders. The decor is interesting and intimate and the bathrooms... well let's just say that it seems they want to make sure your entire experience is a 'dance party'."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Value: 5/5  Came to Otto's Bierhalle for dinner one Tuesday night, and left feeling EXTREMELY happy and full!! My friend and I shared the Oktoberfest Feast, along with a side of spatz and cheese. It was, needless to say, a feast that the two of us certainly could not finish, despite our best efforts! It was a ton of meat, all with interesting / different flavors, but I was expecting a bit more out of the feast accompaniments.  There were too many fries, making them get a bit cold after some time, and the sauerkraut and house pickles were not mindblowing. Still a very very delicious and filling meal though!   I was also a huge fan of the spatz and cheese, which is essentially just mac and cheese with German egg noodles :)   Our waitress was very knowledgeable about beers, and was able to recommend two beers that my friend and i both really liked."}
{"text":"Nice decor, went on a Friday night, got the Oktoberfest shared between 2 ppl. 2 of the sausages tasted uncooked. Food wasn't bad but not worth the diarrhea we booth got 30mins to an hr afterwards. 10/10 would not go again for a date"}
{"text":"A quick drink was all I had at Otto's Bierhalle. The experience was good enough as I know I would be back for a repeat visit.  Beer though definitely is the star here. There are 24 taps on rotating features local and imported beers. Though not all German beers but the choice is diversify. If you don't like anything??, there are also 50+ bottles available.  Arriving on a late Wednesday evening and the place was packed! I was lucky there was a lone bar seating available. So definitely make a reservation if you come in a group. Service was fast and friendly. See all the food coming out of the kitchen while enjoying my beer, I know next time I would have to be back for a taste of their food offerings.   A little on the pricey side for the experience. But this is Queen St W afterall."}
{"text":"I love Otto's! Easily accessible on Queen West in a beautiful heritage building. It can get busy in the evenings so I suggest coming early, or be prepared for a wait (you can grab a delicious beer at the bar while you wait for seating, they have a wide rotating selection).  The beer selection is good, but I come to Otto's for the food! Delicious German cuisine, with either prepared family style plates or 'build your own'. The environment is relaxed and fun, with long tables good for larger groups.  Definitely one of my go to spots and a welcome addition to the Queen West neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Finally went here for an actual meal! Having visited for drinks and watching many delicious looking meals pass before my eyes, I knew I needed to return for my own.   This place has gotten very popular since I first visited back in December, so I'm glad we made a reservation. If you're planning on visiting during peak times, you'd be wise to do the same, but note they don't do resos after 8pm.  We arrived right on time for our 8pm Thursday reservation and were seated promptly and made our meal decisions quickly. The beer menu is huge with lots of unfamiliar brews, so we asked a few questions and our server helped us pick our first round. A Left Field Maris for my partner and a Nicklebrook cucumber-lime gose for me. This beer was light, crisp, and with that same subtle refreshing flavour you get when you add cucumber to your water. Plus, well served in a wine glass.   We opted for one of the feasts (specifically the Vienna, one of two vegetarian friendly feasts), which is billed as good for \"up to three\". We two were not sure we were up to the challenge of finishing it all, but figured we could box-up the leftovers for later, which is what ended up happening. Hello schnitzel sandwich for lunch the next day!   The food was great and our server was nice, so the only reason I'm sticking to four and not five stars is because I did at times feel a little forgotten on the busy night we visited. My beer sat empty and we were pushing around our leftovers for awhile before our server checked on us. Not a major issue and I probably could have flagged her down, but just enough to leave me not feeling as jazzed about this place as the last time I visited. I'll be back again though. Busy nights get ahead of the best of any establishment and server."}
{"text":"Food wins here.  Oktoberfest as fantastic!  Sausages are definitely great, but so are the sides.  Sauerkraut, coleslaw, pickles, mustard, and fries.  WUNDERBAR  Also got the pretzels and cheese.  Added a third pretzel that really wasn't necessary.    Beer was decent, but I wasn't to crazy about any one.  Wish they would offer flights for those that aren't form the area."}
{"text":"I went back again but this time, I brought more friends so I can try MORE food!  Of course, we cant say we've eaten here without the pork hock. But this time we ordered the combos. Because we had four people, we decided to order the Bavaria platter. Had the porkhock, the sausage, sweet pickles, fries, grilled vegetables to name a few on this big tray. I thought that's a good way to sample some of the good food this restaurant got.   After the recommendation of Martin, because our feast combo didn't have the rouladen, essentially a roll of beef rolled and stuffed with smoked cured meat, we ordered that on the side and boy, was that a good decision too.   This restaurant is a great restaurant for meat lovers because there's a lot of meat (just the pork hock alone can fill you up real good between two to three people) and it's good for a good group of friends or families.   The food came really fast and the beers were huge. Some beers were as large as 20 oz!! Every time I go, I always have a fantastic time!!"}
{"text":"A big tray of delicious food for a reasonable price with a hip interior filled with plants - my kind of place!   I had the schnitzel & waffles with a side of eggs benny and enjoyed every bite. My friend got the sausage and for a person that doesn't normally LOVE sausages, it was a pleasant surprise. Relative to the other meals I would say the schnitzel sandwich was underwhelming.  You may have to share a table with others as they have long tables with benches, but the hostess allowed us to have our own smaller table, which was a plus.   I heard they had great beer as well so I'll definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"Forget about Church Street, this joint is the real sausage paradise. From hot sausage to types of sausages I can't even pronounce, this place has it all like a Rocco Siffredi movie. Let's not forget about their extensive beer selection that would even make David Hasselhoff proud to be Germain.   Even my wife loves it here. We're not Swingers, but at Otto's I get to share my sausage with people sitting at our table -- and she gets to watch."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer; tons of selection! Lovely atmosphere. Good service.   Would NOT recommended eating dinner here though; the food is snack size for the price of regular portions - what a rip off. (Worth mentioning that the food is actually really good though)"}
{"text":"My friend and I always pass by this place and never had a chance to try it. Last Sat we went there for brunch! It was sooooo great! We both ordered vegetarian Benni! It tasted great! The portion was big enough to fulfill a person! I am going back to this place tomorrow with my other friends and I am already excited to try a new thing in their menu!!"}
{"text":"E: How do you say cheers in German? J: Prost. E: Do German people say it often? J: Yes. We say it.   Sometimes I forget my husband is German. I have no idea how. There are properly pronounced beers ordered often, and photos of him in green velvet lederhosen in my house. I digress...  Prost!   I finally made it to Otto's and I'm sure glad I did. I came in on a Saturday and enjoyed their incredible brunch. They really seem to be doing everything right and deserve all of the love. The beer list, the bathrooms, the giant, meaty platters, the beer list, the beer list...   I had their egg, pork and hollandaise breakfast sandwich and I can't wait to return for giant pretzels and sausage. Mr. Otto, you are the schnit."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Especially the schwienshaxe . Beer selection was very impressive too. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Otto's Bierhalle was the closest I have been to Munich since being in Munich during Oktoberfest 2016.  Otto's was better than expected. The atmosphere, the food, was all exceptional. Their brunch platters are over the top but in a good way. You can easily feed 3, maybe 4 people."}
{"text":"i'm not a fan of the hype behind this place.  for the greater part of a year i have been trying to come to this location and stupid me coming two times when it wasn't open (i was trying to grab lunch) finally i was able to come out with a group of friends on a Saturday night when it was open and ready for business, we had a group of 12 people(big mistake) and no reservation(bigger mistake) when we got in, we were chastised for not making a reservation from a lady who seemingly had the business iPad attached to her hip, a lot of um's and uh's were expressed by her and \"oh we have another dinner party showing up in 30 minutes who actually made a reservation\" my retort was i understand that but we are here now. after about 15 minutes of back and forth we were finally sat down and amazingly together. as all of my friends conversed i couldn't help but notice the simplistic design of inside of this place, and also the weird light setting, not something i was a big fan of, looked at the menu and right away i was conflicted, i wanted a little bit of everything, so my eyes took me over to the platters and i settled on the Oktoberfest platter and my S.o. had the Rouladen with a salad to start. all of our orders was taken and we had a decent sized conversation while the app's started hitting the table, the smells right away were very infectious, leaving the rest of us who didn't order app's salivating at the mouth. i was very happy with the size of my platter by the time it hit my seat, as i didn't eat much during the day and had a 12 hour shift, so i was quite hangry by the time the app's hit, let alone my main course. i started to eat a little bit, until i realized that everyone at the table had food minus my S.o. in my selfishness of eating before her i asked if she knew what was going on with the food, and we had no idea. the waiter finally brought her food and it looked nothing like the description, to the point where we got the waiters attention to let him know that the beef was missing from the tray, he went to the kitchen with this information and came back and asked what the issue was again? seriously dude? so he went back to the kitchen and got an assistant manager to our table to tell us that this \"roll of stuff that looked like mushrooms\" was in fact the main course of the meal for that tray...um OK...how are you going to have a main course come out and the side of the main is actually bigger then the main...what was even funnier after the fact was that we had a friend who strictly ordered a side as a meal and the side was better proportioned/even then the main AND was cheaper? my \"feast/platter\" was OK the smell was fantastic, but the flavor was lackluster to say the least the best part of my dish and i can't even make this up was the sauerkraut, the sauerkraut was absolutely fantastic, and i completed my platter without any help whatsoever. we didn't stick around for any desserts but i was able to hit up the bathrooms before leaving and they are like nothing you have ever experienced. a big button starts up a sound system/lights/disco with glow in the dark messages/paintings on the wall, and its a really good time. whats funnier is that all four bathrooms have a different light set up/music/glow in the dark drawings.   in short  the service is terrible and full of attitude.  the food is lackluster with awkward sizes and portions the bathrooms are the best part of this place.   would not go out of my way to come back here...period"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for a girls night. The interior is beautiful and the bathrooms are fun just like the location in Kensington.   It's completely different than the Kensington location though. Trendier environment and WAY longer wait to sit down!!   All in all it was a good place though. Service was friendly and beer was good but not sure if I'd return for food! It's not like Kensington where you can get amazing take out style donërs...it's more fancy ish foods that are tiny portions. A little disappointing to be honest but oh well! Now I know to only come for booze and dine elsewhere :) maybe I'll try something else next time"}
