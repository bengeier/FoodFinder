{"text":"I've been to this firehouse a few times recently and have been pretty pleased. The first few times the service has been a bit slow and lacking personality. However I took my wife with me this last visit and there was a bar tender with a broken foot who had us almost in tears from laughing so hard. There were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids. This bar now seems to be more of a local place to hang out with good company rather than a typical sports bar that you just go to from time to time.   If there were a better selection of craft beers the firehouse would have 5 stars easily!  Not even a decent IPA! The bartender was knowledgeable about beer however the bar had nothing good to offer.   We were  also introduced to the eli steak which was delicious! It is not on the menu, which makes no sense to us but we will be back for it!"}
{"text":"Service slow food over cooked never asked about reflls on beverages this was before 5 on a Sat.  Usually give 3 strikes and your out. Need to think about that"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a couple of occasions, only to be reminded to never return.  I usually sit at the bar because generally you get better and faster service. False. The bartender was horrid. She had no idea what she was doing other than just opening a beer or pouring a shot. After sitting down at the cleanest spot we could find at a not-so-busy bar, she finally pulled herself away from talking to her bf and his friends at the other side of the bar. Every interaction we had with her she was complaining about being there. If you don't want to be there, then I assure you the customer won't either. So we wait for 30 minutes for our food, again, not busy. I ordered an appetizer and a chicken salad to come separately. \"Could I start with this app and then I'll have this salad\", it was delivered together obviously. The chicken was overcooked and cold. So I politely sent it back with the manager. The bartender had no idea someone took my food back, bad communication. I got the second salad, it was average. Oh, the pickle chips were good, mainly the sauce! So then we waited for her to stop talking to her manager or bf to get or check. When we finally did get her attention and asked for the check, she walked past the computer and forgot about us. Then she said goodbye to her bf, talked with her manager for 5 minutes and came back. She looked at me with a \"oh yea!\" Look and got me my check. I tipped 20% only because I am a good person, but it's the first time I've ever been tempted to tip poorly if at all.  If you're thinking of going here, don't. Go to Taco Bell and you'll be way more satisfied, which is sad. Get better management and better staff!"}
{"text":"On Fri Aug 22 The wife and I wanted to try this location because it looked nice from the outside. The E Market location did not feel safe with the unlit parking lot. The Tallmadge location well lit, nicer area... Inside the Tallmadge Firehouse Pub... MEH.  Dark, had to watch your step, and we didn't have any drinks yet. The booths will only fit super skinny people, so if you are a thick person or bigger, then a regular table and chairs is your only option. Then you are still SOL because half the tables are the high standings bar style, so if you are short, you risk breaking your neck climbing up into one.  Finally this place was LOUD. They had some piece of $#!t band playing with this @$$ hole banging away on a piano. These guys never heard of a sound check. Volume way too high for such a small place.  The wife could not hear me, even when yelling in her ear, to leave. No way to enjoy your meal in such a lousy atmosphere. So much for fish night.  Will we ever try again... highly doubtful.   HUGE FAIL."}
{"text":"When my burger came out I took one bite and the burger was so hard I almost couldn't bite threw. I sat and waited for another 10 minutes before the waitress came back to check on us. I lifted the bottom bun to show her how burnt the burger was. Not only was it burnt but there was disgusting grill debris on the bottom where the grill hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. She apologized and went to put the order in. She came back a few minutes later and took the burger because her manager wanted to see it. I sat for 17 minutes before the waitress walked by again. By this time my family was already done eating so I told her if it wasn't done just to forget about it. She said oh well we have a lot of parties right now so they're behind. I was incredibly frustrated at this point and said I would assume a screwed up order would take precedence as she just walked away. She came back a few seconds later and said oh I meant that it just takes awhile to cook a burger. I said not 15 minutes. She then dropped the bill off for my family's food. As we were cleaning my toddler up she came back 2 minutes later and picked up the bill and asked if I was going to pay for any of it. I said I was planning on it but if that's an option then no. She said I understand I will go get my manager. When the waitress returned she said her manager was outside and told her we didn't have to pay but my wife and daughter couldn't take their leftovers. I was surprised that a manager was too busy outside of the restaurant to talk to an upset customer. She apologized again and said she tried. She then grabbed the to go boxes and walked away. We typically enjoy Firehouse but this was our first time at the Tallmadge location with an absentee manager named Megan and it will be our last."}
{"text":"I am not one to bash restaurants because I grew up in the restaurant business and I have worked in the business for 8 years. I understand that things can go wrong but this incident was completely unacceptable. Our server was teriffic and our appetizers were very good also.  I was dining with my boyfriend and we had an accident. The light above us was bumped by my boyfriends computer and shattered all over us. I had a deep slice in my finger.  The manager came over (very rude) and asked what had happened. We informed her and she said we must fill out an incident report.(never asking if we were ok .. I couldnt get my finger to stop bleeding) She was very rude and informed us that she will be sending us a bill. She was never concerned about us and if we were ok yet there was glass everywhere. I was in complete shocked of her attitude. The server was very concerned and got me a band aid and new drinks.  I walked into the restroom to clean up my finger and the manager was in the backroom area bashing us. I could not believe she was acting this way. It was clearly an accident. Why would we apologize when she was extrememly rude to us from the start.  We will not be returning. I think the manager needs to realize what is more important... Im sure the light was a whole 5 dollars. We thanked our server and PAID our bill so that we could leave as soon as possible. Completely dumb founded of this incident!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim. Never again. Nasty fries made from rotten potatoes. Dr Pepper tasted like a mix of lemonade and Doctor Pepper. Waitress was nice, but the food was just terrible."}
{"text":"Tallmadge has a lot of little bars and grilles that offer good lunch options. This is not one of them. The service was indifferent at best and rude, if I'm being 100% objective. I ordered a soft drink that was awful; when I mentioned it, the server rudely replied \"that's what you ordered.\"  I should have left then but decided to stay and see what the food was like.   Bad choice.   I ordered a chicken bacon ranch wrap. The only bacon in the entire wrap was done burnt bacon bits stuffed in the middle of each side of the wrap. The grizzle was inedible.  The rest of the wrap was a mix of overripe tomatoes, lettuce that was turning brown and dry chicken with globs of ranch dressing smattering in random spots. I ate half of the wrap and mentioned the issues with it. My server was indifferent and didn't offer an apology or a manager to discuss.   The side salad was ok. There were lots of vegetables and it was a good size. Unfortunately, it was topped with freezer burned shredded cheese and the blue cheese dressing came with an upcharge that wasn't on the menu.   Additionally, the soda I sent back was on my bill. The server defended both charges; stating that the blue cheese upcharge was stated in the wings section. Um, ok, it costs $1 for blue cheese with my wings so it also costs a buck with a salad?     Having decided that I'll never return here, I explained how terrible the service, food, drink, and customer service was and wished her, and her owners, good luck. The manager approached me to discuss, but that time had passed.   Avoid this place for food and if you value good service."}
{"text":"The place was empty but a party of 9 of us couldn't get anyone to wait on us. We were at the funeral home around the circle and thought we would go somewhere close. What a mistake we left there and went to Rocknes! No wonder the place was empty!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch w Dig Dady only because Danny boys wasn't l open next door.  This place is not good. Slow service. Stale bar smell. Don't bus after people leave. Had to dine by the old trash. Seems understaffed with little interest to serve."}
{"text":"I took my nieces to Firehouse for lunch. The chicken nacho appetizer was large enough for all three of us. My nieces each had their favorite burgers and fries. After talking with our waiter, I decided on the buffalo chicken wrap with fries. I don't especially care for the regular fries, so this time I got coated fries. My nieces both reported tht their burgers were very good. My wrap was good but could have used a little more buffalo sauce. I very much enjoyed the coated fries and all three of us loved the nachos. The waiter was very friendly and very familiar with each of the items on the menu. He kept an eye on our table but was not intrusive. When we ran low on our drinks, he was right there with a fresh one. All-in-all, it was a great experience. Very good food, nice atmosphere, great wait staff. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Taking into consideration that this establishment is a bar with a restaurant the food isn't bad.  They have your usual bar fare - burgers, wings, fries and other fried stuff.  The Friday fish fry is great and the specialty pizzas look great.   The atmosphere is nice (for what it is) with lots of TVs to check out the sports scores and to play trivia or keno. We have stopped in a few times and each time there was an unusually long wait or some unusual circumstance at the hostess station.  The hostess was either indifferent to to growing crowd in the waiting area, or there was one trip where we were ignored by two staff members prior to anyone acknowledging us and checking us in.  But, once seated service has always been up to par."}
{"text":"nasty.just gross food"}
{"text":"Just sat here at the bar and watched an employee come behind it to fill up some containers.  No gloves, no utensils, just a bare handful of olives with a quick wipe of a bar rag and then and handful of cherries.  This was 5:30 at night with a bar full of people watching in equal disbelief and disgust.  I will never eat here or drink here again.  I feel dirty just for sitting here witnessing it"}
{"text":"Have been here many times, it's usually at least okay. Prices are a bit high for both food and drink, but it's comfortable and friendly - usually. Today for some reason service has taken a nose dive. I'm feeling all but ignored. Will this be a new trend? Dunno, will probably give it 1 more chance but if I don't see drastic improvement I'm done with Firehouse. This place is on no way special enough to justify putting up with that."}
{"text":"I'm a local and been coming here ever since I can remember. There food is ok but it's what u expect for bar food it's not bad, but not anything to praise about. I do like the bar and the environment when I'm going with my buds."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy. Their menu was big, with lots of different things to choose from. I was disappointed that they only had beer specials and I don't drink beer. It was definitely a mixed crowd, but the older people seemed to enjoy karaoke the most. Going to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Well I would have never came here if I saw the 2 stars on yelp....got the loaded mac and cheese because server and hostess said it was their best item.   Bland flavor and tough chicken. Yet maybe 3 stars is more appropriate than 2."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food. I can't. I left after 45 minutes of waiting for a table (at 1:15 on a Monday with no other customers waiting). Apparently the hold up was finding a spot for four people, one of which needed a high chair.   When we were finally seated, the server couldn't understand the difference between iced tea and Hi-C. And made two trips to deliver our drinks after he forgot the order. When we waited another 10 minutes for straws, we decided that we had had enough and left.   If they were busy, I would understand the wait. I'm a patient person. But that was not the case. This was just bad service. And unfortunately, the staff seemed more concerned with talking to their friends than waiting on us."}
{"text":"Cheap beers. Friendly bartender.   Super loud and annoying though.  Ugly lighting in the outside seating area.  Like fluorescent lighting that casts ugly shadows across one's face.  Everyone out there was practically screaming their conversations.  Unnecessarily so.  I am not a fan of the crowd.    I didn't try the food, but I likely would not make a point of trying to go back to do so."}
{"text":"The staff is rude and inconsiderate. You wait and wait and wait to be seated. When you finally get seated you wait some more. The bartenders are loud and obnoxious. The food is very inconsistent. There are better places to eat in the area"}
{"text":"HALF OFF DRINKS ON WEDNESDAYS!  Nothing better than getting drunk without having to break the bank. Then you take a couple dollars from what you just saved and you order a delicious dollar burger and some cheese, cause your not a savage, and you get some fries to down that delicious cheeseburger with. The wings here are on point. Good amounts of sauce and lots of flavor, of course traditional, NO boneless, get that chicken nugget bs outta here.  4 stars because ONE server hates her job and can never smile. Bartenders are kind and know their stuff."}
{"text":"Tried the Firehouse again last night on a whim.  KENO and sports were a big draw for us.  Unfortunately the KENO screens were frozen the entire time we were there.  I think they've been frozen since the last time we were there.  Service - ok; fellow customers - we had no idea you could use profanity as nearly every word in a sentence; food - the steak special was good; crowd - two tables of live trivia game players that seemed to be having fun.  Other than the 8 customers playing trivia and the sailors sitting next to us, we were nearly alone in the restaurant for 2 hours."}
{"text":"We were both starved. Ok, not starved....that's a bit dramatic. But we were super hungry ok? It felt a lot worse at the time!  Did a quick search on google and found this beauty. $.49 wings? YELP YES! We figured we would give it a shot and boy, super stoked that we did. Ordered 5 BBQ, 5 teriyaki, 5 Erie Thai and 5 sweet Thai. Sweet mother of monkey milk, the wings are so awesome! Crispy, meaty and saucy. Kinda like me. But seriously, the wings are amazing. Also got a side of chips and salsa...and the salad is super yummy!  Service was good and our waitress Brittany was super friendly and helpful. We had no wait to get a table and the food came out pretty darn quick. The restaurant appeared clean and well put together. I will admit that the layout of the building is really wonky and the bathrooms are shared with Danny Boys. But hey, they were clean....so I cannot complain!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly service, a nice environment, and a good place to watch a sporting event. The menu is primarily typical bar food; I had a crispy chicken wrap, which was very good."}
{"text":"Great location, probably good to watch a game. Like the atmosphere a lot. Food?  The emphasis is quantity over quality. Many common, boring fried /high carb standards that you would get at any one of dozens of places around Akron."}
{"text":"Typical bar food but I did have a good time watching my husband eat the ladder which is a 2 pound double cheeseburger.  Food is good.  Server was not.  But again it's a bar and we weren't drinking so we didn't rate on her list of tables to care about."}
{"text":"The food here is awful. I would have rather ate at Mcdonalds. The experience was horrible as well. During the meal we watched as the manager made remarks about other patrons and staff. I would never eat here again if it was the last place on earth that was serving food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was just frozen food heated up and thrown on a plate. The boneless wings were probably the worst boneless wings of all time. Rally's is fast food, but has way better boneless wings.  Maybe a good place for a beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Very nice, slick interior with many flat screen TV's and a beautiful circular bar with comfortable seats.  I had been expecting the place to be a dive like the Cuyahoga Falls Firehouse Grill.  This was a pleasant surprise.    Beer: 16 taps, mostly run of the mill stuff but they did have a couple Great Lakes and a summer shandy.  Wednesdays beer is half off.  A tall Bud is $2.    Food is above average sports bar:  Sandwiches were good and the portions were hearty.  I had the grouper salad and was very happy with it.   In addition to regular bar food, the menu has a number of unusual items.  (Stay away from the glazed-donut burger; I haven't had it, but really... no one should eat such a thing).  Anyway, grouper, which they also have by itself or in a sandwich, is a nice touch.  Unbreaded fish is a rarity in a sports bar.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Boo.  Friday night...only one waitress was nice.  The redhead.  The two blondes--one tall with shorter hair, and one short with long hair were both super rude.  You work at a FREAKING BAR. If you don't expect to deal with drunk punks, don't work at a BAR! (duh)  Someone spilled a little bit of beer, and the long-haired blonde rolled her eyes, grabbed the cup, and stormed off shaking her head.  I apologized as she came back with a towel, but she just ignored me.  Perhaps she thinks she is at the Ritz where these issues probably won't happen.   I don't know how long I have to stand at the bar with cash in my hand looking directly at people to get a drink.  I waited at least 10 mins while they were not serving anyone else, then I just put my money away.  Don't worry, you can absolutely have a successful business by ignoring customers, being rude, and being cranky.  Definitely an ingenious way to earn tips as well..  Pretty sure none of our party of 8+ will be returning.  Fail."}
{"text":"A very nice 1st visit.  I like the set up. Well lit, good food, friendly people.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. I sat at the bar and watched a server/bartender with short reddish purple hair stuck her bare hands into the olives, whipped her hand on a used bar rag, and then went bare handed into the cherries. There was no hand washing involved. She did so in front of the entire bar, I couldn't believe it. Both containers now are contaminated and shouldn't be used again. Seriously disgusting."}
{"text":"The best thing about any Firehouse is the dollar hamburger and buck seventy-five LaBatt on draft. They run a 49 cent special on wings Tue, half off apps and sandwiches for ladies Wed, and all-you-can eat fish Fri. They've a steak and shrimp surf n turf on Sat that I've not yet had, but the Tallmadge pub is cozy and friendly, and the specials rock. Prefer it to Delanies across the street."}
{"text":"Lotsa crappy fried food on the menu. Nothing stands out as unique or original. Absolutely nothing healthy.   Bar has lotsa bottles of liquor, including many flavored vodkas, and is able to make some fun exotic drinks.   Service is meh. Waitresses annoyingly show up multiple times to ask the same thing.   Individual tvs in each booth are fun.   This place fully deserves a two star rating."}
{"text":"Worst bartenders I've delt with in a long time. Was trying to get the tribe game on and it was the biggest hassle in the world.  Should of already had the game on.  Still waiting on a bottle of Miller light and bud light.  Only ten people sitting around the bar.  Not busy at all.  Overall the rudest wait staff I've seen in a while.  GO TO THE BAR NEXT DOOR.  I haven't even been there but it's got to be better."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews, but my experience here was fine. Our waitress handled our group of 10+ people adequately, and everyone seemed happy enough with their meals.   I got the 10oz strip steak with 2 sides for $13.99 and it was cooked to medium correctly. My wife liked her Veggie wrap, and the burgers seemed well received. The boneless wings weren't humongous, but the \"Lake Erie Smoke\" dry rub is as good a dry rub as I've ever tasted.   I didn't order a drink, but the beers seem really cheap."}
{"text":"Food is awful, the owners and managers are all rude and disrespectful. Owner was heard saying he doesn't care about the customers! Unbelievable. Never going here again. They don't deserve Tallmadge's residents business."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Food was decent. However I sat there and watched the bartender eat from a customers plate. I don't care if it was her spouse, I was still gross to eat off someone's plate then serve food and drinks to people. Our waitress then tries to charge me $2 for each of my kids drinks when drinks are inlcluded. Asked for boxes which she never brought. I even spoke to the manager about all this who clearly could not understand me. She did take the drinks off the bill AND she never brought boxes. So freakin gross. First time there...NEVER going back. If people who work out front act like that, I don't even want to know what the kitchen staff does. Stay away, far far away expecially if your looking for a clean place to eat."}
{"text":"The chicken tasted like it was put in the microwave and the water tasted like rust very disappointed and service was slow  will not be going back there very over priced for the food"}
{"text":"Went here again for trivia night. Service was very good. Food was not good. 7.99 for about 20 French fries that were cold. Never again. I will eat before I go."}
{"text":"It is just so so.  The food is OK. The service has not been consistently good. It is usually busy and has a large full bar, so I think people enjoy going there to socialize, but with my family I usually choose another restaurant despite its close location to my home."}
{"text":"Lots of bad reviews but I'm not sure why. The staff was nice and the food was moderately priced. The drinks were cheap during happy hour. It's a great place to stop by after a long day at work and have a cold one.   Oh, and $1 burgers!  They aren't gourmet or anything, but it's better than McDonald's. Also the wings had lots of meat on the bone and were covered in sauce. \"Hot\" was perfect for me, a little kick but not overwhelming with a good, traditional buffalo flavor.   Maybe it's not as good if they are busy, but I was satisfied. Gets 4 stars over just 3 because they had good specials and attentive bartenders."}
{"text":"This was cut and paste from cleveland.com.    TALLMADGE, Ohio -- After Georgie's Pub in Akron, Firehouse Grill and Pub on Tallmadge Circle had the most public health violations of any bar and grill establishment in Summit County, racking up 42 citations through the first nine months of the year.   A pestilent infestation, dirty cooking tools and faulty heating and cooling of foods were all noted as recurring violations at Firehouse, which was inspected in January, February, May and June."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was not so much. Had to ask the waitress to order, for refills, the check...The high boy stools were pretty uncomfortable if you are anything but anorexic. Would ask for a booth next time. Overall, the food was a good value an tasty."}
{"text":"Visited the new location in the old Bumpas Drug building on 1/26/2013. We were a party of 6 who went there for drinks and dinner to celebrate a birthday.  Let me preface this review by saying our group doesn't get to see eachother as much as we used to and I was looking forward to hanging out and having some drinks.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of food because this is a bar and the food there is OK.. it's deep fried bar food and burgers. What I really didn't appreciate was to be rushed out of the door as soon as our food orders hit the table.   No sooner did we start eating, that our bills were placed on the table. Then every couple minutes the waitress would come around looking to take the bills. But..but.. I wanted to order more drinks! We weren't even finished eating and people were coming over to clean our table. The manager was lingering.. the hostess kept poking her head around the corner to see if we were done.. the waitress nervously kept coming around to try and usher us out. The general feeling was that the staff had decided it was time for us to go.   I was really getting agitated. If they wanted us gone they certainly had accomplished their goal. I suggested we go somewhere else where we won't be rushed out the door when we wanted to spend more money. A couple in our party ordered steak dinners and I was drinking $7.00 mixed drinks for Pete's sake. It's not like we were taking up space eating dollar burgers and drinking PBR.   I have never been more pissed off. I stood up to put on my coat, hadn't even got one arm in the sleeve and then the manager rushed right over to say \"Have a nice night!\"   MESSAGE RECEIVED. Never going back here."}
