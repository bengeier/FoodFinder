{"text":"Had the pork belly bbq with another friend and the portion size was HUGE for its price. We were super full after eating 75% with 5-6 pieces of pork left. It came with soup, rice, and lettuce, as well as some sauce. The service was very friendly and prompt as well."}
{"text":"I love this place for some good, reliable Korea BBQ. The portion is great, service is very fast and efficient. Do I expect friendliness from a quick-eating Asian joint? Not really. I come here for good food and quick, efficient service, just like Congee Queen. My friends and I ask for refills on the lettuce wraps so often and they get filled so quickly, free of charge, whereas I've been to poshier places where they charge per basket of lettuce! Blasphemy!

I've tried the seafood pancake and spicy chicken (kkampoonggi) and it's pretty good... Their soups that come with the $30 pork belly combo is really good and satisfying. 

One suggestion is to wear something that can easily be washed because you'll leave the joint pretty smelly with delicious BBQ-ness. Also maybe shoes that can easily be taken off just in case you get seats by the long table :)"}
{"text":"Food are in good quality but the way they serve us are not good..and they forcing us to give tip like what the hell?!"}
{"text":"Solid food.

Service is typical Korean.  If you don't flag someone down they ignore you.  I don't know why all Korean places have such terrible service.  Like 1 bottle of water is enough for 8 people eating spicy food?!  wtf.  

BBQ was solid.  Beef was well marbled.  Seafood soup was one of the best I've tasted.  Deep flavor.  

Simple food done right."}
{"text":"24 hour Korean BBQ deliciousness!! 

Went for a late night pork belly BBQ, and it was great! Pork was thick cut, and servers were not pushy! They put the appropriate amount of meat on the grill and let you Handle the rest. For whatever reason, many places pile the meat on all at once, and once they are left on the grill, they get dried out and gross- not how I prefer my meat! 

The Korean seafood pancake is a must! It is hearty and delicious! Make sure you order it to go with your BBQ meal! It is definitely a change of texture and taste for your palette. It is also great if you are with people who do not prefer spicy foods, or kids! 

This place offers both traditional seating and normal seating! You cannot be picky with which type you get as it is busy at almost all hours! Traditional seating is a fun experience, however if you are not used to sitting on the raised floor, you may find your legs numb before the end of your meal!"}
{"text":"Mmm Pig Organ Soup... (Soondae Gook)

Yes, I know, it sounds disgusting. But on a cold rainy day, it really hits the spot. Ample in quantity and flavour, I visit Lim Ga Ne, and don't even need a menu.

I haven't tried many of their other foods, as I find them to be on the pricier side.

The side dishes really are far superior to all Korean diner-type places, and you just can't say no to free vegetable pancake. Super bonus is the purple multigrain rice they serve. Say no to diabetes.

I still stand by my original warning on the cold buckwheat noodles. Not sure if they still serve store-bought instant noodles, but I am not playing that game again."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of the pleasant aroma of pure dog shit. Well then do I have the place for you. As soon as you walk in the smell of fermenting shit overtakes you like a homeless man sucker punching you straight in the gut. As you become more desensitized, still try to breath through your mouth as the smell never truly leaves just like the bitter sweet memories of your first crush on Tapenga from Boy Meets World.

Food was pretty good!?!"}
{"text":"??????????????spicy?cheese????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"i ordered bossam and it was crap. Some of the food doesn't seem too clean."}
{"text":"Came to this Korean restaurant with my friend for a lunch today. This place is actually highly recommended by one of our friends and it is open 24 hours for business. When stepping into the restaurant, I noticed that there were two kinds of seatings - Korean style floor seating and regular chair seating. We finally chose to sit on the regular chair seating which was more comfortable for us than kneeling on the floor. We ordered one SamGyeTang (Ginseng Chicken) and one KamJaTang (Pork Bone Soup). We ultimately waited about 15-20 minutes to get our food on the table. Fortunately, they all came out so fresh, hot, tasty and flavorful. The prices are quite decent - $15.99 for ginseng chicken and $7.99 for pork bone soup. Whenever I feel like to eat Korean food, I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu..."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in the area! Love it! I get the pork bone soup every time I go and it is great. Service is friendly and quick. Side dishes are great here as well. 
It gets busy here so try to go a little earlier on weekends."}
{"text":"At Finch, Lim Gah Neh is a very popular Korean restaurant chain in the heart of Uptown Koreatown. This location offers especially fresh and delicious cuts of barbeque meats such as beef ribs and freshly sliced pork belly, and this is the place for Korean barbeques. Besides that, I will order extra cold appetizers (panchan) as they are both sweet, fresh and savoury and is a great start to the meal."}
{"text":"Great meal here for the price! There are good standard dishes like bibimbap and bulgogi for about $10. There were some very expensive meat dishes that I would have liked to try except for the price. Guess they have food at the high and low levels.
I got bulgogi and the flavour was great. Kimchi fried rice was tasty delicious carb-y goodness, I probably enjoyed it so much because I don't usually eat rice! Great meal with 5-6 complimentary Korean sides being brought to us. They don't always serve the Korean pancake but ask for it! First plate is free :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Korean restaurant near Christie station. Service is great here. I go here regularly and always get a warm welcome and even a hug from the owner. It really feels like a family restaurant with authentic \"home cooked\" Korean food. So many side dishes that taste divine, the jigae's have such complex flavors and are the best I have tasted so far in Toronto. Quality, comfort and abundance. My fave!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible!! Don't expect them to refill your tea! After waiting for half an hour, every other table that came after us were served. We caught that they forgot about sending our orders to the kitchen or serving us appetizers, and  they did not even apologize!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty authentic. When you order bbq, they give u lettuce wraps for sure and the spicy salad side to go with it too. Most place don't do this. 

Taste wise, it's pretty traditional. 24 hour service. Great for my 2am soup craving."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one at Finch, though that one is not that bad either.

Lamb soup. Get this amazing soup if you're into game meats.

Everything else is amazing too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap Korean restaurant, I would not recommend coming here. However, their portion sizes and great taste definitely make up for it. My friend and I arrived here for dinner on a Friday night around 6:30 pm. The place was not crowded, but people were eating and enjoying themselves, so we sat down right away. I was surprised at the price of the menu items where nothing was less of $9 for a meal and all the way up to +$40 for larger family sized dishes. I decided on the Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Stew) having only eaten it once and wanting to compare (cost was $11.30 incl. tax). While we were waiting, we were served a Korean pancake. Service was quick and we both ate it up because it was so good! 

The stew was delicious~! It was spicy to the right amount, the meat was tender, and the broth was not too salty. The amount of sides we were given were more than enough (like the pickled radish, kimchi, glass noodles, pickled cucumbers, soybean sprouts, fish cakes) and the amount of rice was right as well. 

Would come here again when not on a student budget, but overall enjoyed my meal very much."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother - we were walking along Yonge and just decided to pick a restaurant randomly - we were there for a late lunch. 

We were the only ones in the restaurant who didn`t speak Korean, servers spoke English with ease, so no communication problems there. You can choose between sitting at a lower table (and sitting on your bum) or sitting at regular tables.

Ordered the glass noodles in beef broth (and winter melon!) and a beef fried rice dish.  (M13 and M11 respectively). Both used purple rice. I recommend getting the glass noodles in broth if you`re in a group. The soup tasted good and it`s a good portion to share. Other tables were having food cooked on a portable stove (i have no idea what that is, but i`m definitely trying that next time). 

This is an awesome place if you`re hungry (or going as a group... or both :) )  - they give you free (and yummy!) pancakes plus a lot of appetizers. Some yelpers have added photos that show the appetizers so check that out to get some ideas as to what you`ll walk in to :) :)"}
{"text":"I like this place.  They give generous amount of sides and I have to admit sometimes I come because I crave for Korean sides.  The pork bone soup is yummy with good portion of meat and potatoes, and they serve purple rice here.  They seem to be popular for their table side cooking/Korean hot pot and BBQ and it's quite enjoyable to come with friends during the winter for their hot stewed.   The price here is also reasonable in comparison with other Korean joints nearby.  The service, however, is efficient and never friendly.  During peak hour would be required to wait up to 10-15 min for a table.  The seating area is really not big and they do have traditional Korean seating floor which seems to be popular for average patrons, but I still much prefer table and chair arrangement.
I will give the overall experience 3.5, the food is good but service and cleanliness could use some improvements."}
{"text":"Want to do a follow up review from last time as I find the food was good but service was sometimes pretty slow.  While browsing the menu I realize they serve goat stew which doesn't serve in every single Korean restaurants.  Try goat stew this time and it did not disappoint, it is yummy and delicious.  This type of broth really warms me up.  It does have mixed of lean and fat meat, mostly lean.  Spice level is about right, not very spicy.  Again, good portion for the side dishes, and tasty.  Green onion pancake is always good gesture. This time the service is a lot faster than first time.  I also notice many patrons are Korean, which is always a good sign when visiting a Korean restaurant.  Overall, I think the food here is one of the best in the area, although the price seems to be pricier than surrounding places, it does provide generous portion.  Will definitely visit again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner with some of my Waterloo friends and must say for a restaurant we were settling for it was great! 
Had we gone to our original choice of buk chang dong soon we probably would have missed out on another player in this crowd of Korean restauranteurs. 
I got the bibim bap which was good and given the territory anything less would be surprising, the portion of rice given could have been smaller however. The real differentiator between the other Korean offerings would be the banchan which were above and beyond anything I have had at other Korean places. They add on the Korean version of ikan bilis which is a personal favorite and earns this restaurant an extra half star. 

The price point is a bit disappointing as it is slightly more expensive than buk chang dong soon tofu and for a final score, I give this place a 3. 2 for the food quality, and 1 for the banchan and service."}
{"text":"Everyone has the right to their opinion, just like I have my own - but, when it comes to Korean food, I can say that it's rare that I find anyone who has frequented more Korean restaurants than I have.  I have lived in the North York area for the last 15 years and have hung out in the old Korea town more times than I can count.  Lim Ga Ne, is one of the very few Korean restaurants that started the recent trend of 24/7, I believe \"Owl\" started initially.  

Lim Ga Ne, started off as being a place where mainly drunk Koreans (usually young international students) would come to fill their bellies after a long night of drinking soju.  Eventually, the word spread of this place because the price was excellent, service was fast, food was amazing, and of course the ability to go there at any time.  I've been going there for about 2 years now and I've gotten to know the owner.  She used to be a waitress and then saved all her money and invested all of it into this restaurant.  She's usually there 14 hours/day.  I dare anyone to say they work as hard as this woman.  This is the reason why I feel strongly that there are very few Korean restaurants that can challenge this one in all aspects: pricing, quality of food, service, delivery of service, food quantity, atmosphere, environment, convenience, etc.  

Usually, hot tea is automatically provided (summer or winter) at no charge.  You usually have to ask for cold water.  It is family friendly but, spacing is limited and so booster chairs are limited.  They have traditional Korean style seating where you have to take your shoes off and sit on a raised floor (about 1 foot off the ground) but, it is pretty cramped because the table is pretty low.  The restaurant itself probably seats about 50 people.  Appetizers are also served free of charge - usually 5 to 6 dishes.  The main menu is full of many types of Korean dishes.  I believe the only popular Korean dish that they don't serve is \"ja jang myun\".  Other popular dishes are served: galbi tang, soon tubu chigae, gam ja tang, gan pong gi, just to name a few.  As I've stated before, service is fast.  The waitresses are very limited in their English skills, so be patient and understanding.  I've been there both in the day and night time and I've yet to see any situation where the waitresses are rude.  If they are, it is likely because you were drunk or again - the language barrier.  That doesn't imply that service is bad though - I read one review from someone who stated service was good but, when asking for a water refill they got the cold ice dagger stare.  Kind of hypocritical to state that if you received good service and then got upset about someone giving you the cut eye for refilling your water.  Anyways, the last piece of info is that the place is usually busy after 6pm until 1am on Thursdays - Fridays, so be wary of that."}
{"text":"This is my go to place w my friend for classic spicy 'hot pot' meat and veggies. For $35-45 , you can get a large pan cooked over a portable stove with enough food to feed 4 people (or 2 people with 2 take out boxes). We usually order the pork ribs galbi or seafood mix. Prices are good and portions and side dishes are plentiful. Line up is never too long and it's usually packed on the weekend. I love their kimchi radish! Can't go wrong w this place!"}
{"text":"Make sure to check your bill before you pay. They tried to 'accidentally' add on extra $15 to my bill. This also happened to couple of my other friends. When I brought up the problem to the waitress, she tried to ignore the issue and didn't even apologize when she found out it was mistake on their end. There are so many other Korean restaurants in Toronto that serves better quality food with good service. Also keep in mind that I think they reuse their side dishes (those complimentary apps you folks go crazy over)."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst service ever (the Christie Limganae). As a korean i hate to write bad review on a korean restaurant but they are the worst in toronto. Used to be good until last year but they started putting in junks in the food like colouring and msgs to make the horrible soups look genuine. Found hair in food and they just snatched the food and didnt even apologize. I wouldnt go there to try korean food. Actually i wouldnt go there for anything if youre half sane."}
{"text":"Best friend and I were craving for some Korean hot pot and this place had great reviews and it helped that they made more than two types of Korean hot pot. My friend and I got here around 6:30 pm on a Friday and it was packed! We managed to sit on this tiny table, luckily some people left and we moved to a bigger table! We ordered the Kimchi Korean Hot Pot (Kimchi Budae Jjigae). We got the usual side dishes.. kimchi, bean sprout salad, japchae, watercress, radish, and jalapeno radish in soy sauce. They were all yummy and had their own unique flavor. The hot pot came and we were so excited. You can immediately see all the items in the hot pot, the rice cakes, fresh tofu, glass noodle, and sliced pork. We waited patiently as it cooks right in front of us. It cooks pretty quick and I would recommend that you turn down the heat while you eat. since you don't want everything to over cook! Warning** it is very spicy! If you aren't a fan of spice, avoid this at all cost!! 

Overall the food was great! The service was good but it seems that all Korean places seem \"understaffed\" that's why they have the 4 stars. But yes, give it a try. They have pictures for most of the items so its great for first timers! 

Happy Belly :)"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and ordered spicy chicken hot pot for 2 people, which was so good! We were so full. And the sides dishes were delicious too. Definitely will come back later on."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is definitely my staple korean restaurant right now. Honestly, I only come for the complimentary veggie pancakes. Most entrees range from a $8-$15, a good price with reasonable proportions. Of the dozen or so times I've gone this year, I haven't had a bad experience with the food yet. The waitresses are nice but they can sometimes have a bit of a language barrier. I personally like to order a small of the Jok Bal (Pork hock) but that's because I love simple food and the garlic. Lots of garlic. And small is not very small; it's great to share. The cold noodles are also delicious. Just try here and there. You will find something you like, I'm sure of it!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the blood sausage. Too bland. Bf had an order of fried rice, I ordered a soup and a medium blood sausage. Came to about 45. The food was ok, not as good as other have said"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of soondae (Korean sausage), Lim Ga Ne is the place to be! 

You can order an assortment of pig organs or just the soondae itself. I personally did not enjoy my pig liver, so I only order soondae! 

This place is known for their \"out-the-door\" queues but table turnover time is quick and the servers know how to act fast and efficient. Not only do they speak Korean and English, some servers are also fluent in Chinese! 

The prices are reasonable, comparable to other Korean restaurants in the area. There are many options for sharing between two people or table top cooking dishes. 

I don't know how other customers sit on the floor without back support, but my lower back was so sore within minutes. My legs also fell asleep and I couldn't move them after the meal. I prefer ordering takeout, as their seating area isn't the most comfortable. The seated area with chairs are also very crammed - one time my long winter jacket was trampled on multiple times by various people... I was not a happy camper. 

Overall, this place serves great soondae and sharing dishes, but be prepared to sit through a very uncomfortable meal. I really suggest takeout!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that's been around seemingly forever and knows it too...in all the good ways and bad ways. Good, because: the food is delicious (think traditional Korean comfort food), portions and prices are equally excellent, dishes come out fast and service is super efficient. Bad, because: the interior and decor has clearly not been updated in a very long time, the side dishes are a miss, and service quality is rather poor. We asked for a refill of the banchan, then for more water, and were basically ignored both times lol. The waitress managed to hear us asking for the bill though, luckily.

I would essentially think of this restaurant as a well-established semi-fast food joint that you can hit up for cravings anytime (open 24/7!!!). Guaranteed to satisfy your stomachs, and who cares about the rest."}
{"text":"Lim Ga Ne has Korean dishes that I don't typically see in other Korean restaurants around the Yonge/Sheppard area that are serving up the usual bulgogi (sliced marinated beef) and gamjatang (pork bone soup). The menu doesn't look very long but I still have not made my way through half of the things I want to try. The dishes I have tried were all quite tasty though and I really liked the kampungi (fried chicken with stickey sweet sauce).  Can someone tell me how you are supposed to eat the bo sam though?? This dish comes with lettuce, boiled pork, and raw oysters...?!? The pork was good but the oysters tasted a bit overly fishy.  Dishes here are upwards of $10 (more like average of $15) but they bring a lot of side dishes with the meal and the portions are quite big. Unless you have a huge appetite or are super hungry, you can split one dish between two people. The service is typical of Korean restaurants around the area; I would feel more comfortable if I spoke Korean but you can get your point across in English."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner! (By late, I mean 3 a.m.)

FOOD: It's not the best korean food I've had, but the portions are big and they have a lot of things on the menu, including korean BBQ, hotpot, and individual dishes.
I ordered the bulgogi & octopus stew to share with my friend and it came in this huge hotpot! I would have preferred it not to be so sweet, but it was good nonetheless. I have tried their bossam and jok bal here as well, and they're also okay too. Not great, but not bad. 

SERVICE: The staff here are ALWAYS so friendly I find. The night we went there was only one waitress was working and it seemed a bit busy, but the food came out promptly and she was very friendly and was doing the best she could to be prompt given that she was the only one working :) Big smile and joking around with us, she made us feel welcome

OVERALL: GREAT for late night food. They close at 3 a.m. but the night I went, a lot of tables were still there so they were still open and getting customers at 4 a.m. when I left. The service is great and the food isn't half bad, so I will be back when I'm hungry in the middle of the night! (The area is very sketchy though)"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this \"Lim's house\" (rough translation).

Korean restaurants are all about the food, so let's talk about that first. I got soondaeguk for lunch. That stuff is goood. Sides were alright. My friend got gamjatang but I didn't get to taste it. :(

The interior is meh, but at least it's still considerably better than the interior of the soondubu place nearby, which is larger and roomier but slightly gloomier and not very polished at all.

The younger male staff is friendly to everyone while the imo (the old lady server that you always see at Korean restaurants) only checks with Koreans. Kind of a stereotypical Korean restaurant customer service.

Yea, I would come back just for the food."}
{"text":"Great pork belly bbq and side dishes. Yummy kalbi, great grilled fish (forgot the name, yellow something). Great stews. Excellent ambiance!!! Great service. Best 24 hr korean joint in area."}
{"text":"I usually come here super late at night. The food is pretty good. If you're sitting on the floor area you'd be pleasantly surprised because it's heated. Nice warm butt. 
Only thing is, I don't speak Korean & I felt like my table was being ignored. Or maybe because it was 4am, but I definitely felt ignored. 
Food... was... gud... tho... ):"}
{"text":"Visiting friend in the nearby community over the weekend, the place we originally want to have dinner had a long line, have to wait 45-60 mins. Stop by this restaurant instead, still wait about 15 minutes. 
We ordered sea food hot pot and came along with some samplers. They had clam, blue carb, shrimp and fish (don't know the name, has skin and bones, but tasty) mixed with other rice noodle and veges. The quantities were enough for two of us. The crab meat is a bit off the odor, but rest is fine. 
Service is average as so many customers and keep coming. 
We passed by 12 am, still lots of people, it's amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to pretty much every restaurant in Korea town but this one was more noticeable for a few reasons:
Like any other restaurant you can't expect amazing service but they were friendly enough(you can say more than the others). I also like to rate Korean restaurants for their side dishes and this one was among the best. They even gave us korean pancake for free. I know that's not a big deal, but it's a nice gesture. 

Food was really delicious. I got some kind of goat soup and there was plenty of meat inside. 

What I also like about the place is how they put the tax in the price, so what you see on the bill is what you have to pay in the end. It's really annoying when I have to calculate tips, taxes,etc and in the price in the menu is far from what I end up paying. 

The only thing I don't like about it is that the atmosphere is so plain, you could even say boring. It's something I see actually in most Korean restaurants. I felt like if I made my own restaurant without caring too much about the interior it might look even better.
Overall this one plus a few other places are among my top restaurants in KTown. I am also a fan of smaller restaurants. Food feels more authentic that way and more carefully prepared."}
{"text":"I was craving for pork bone soup since last week and got really excited when I was finally going to fix that craving.

Lim Ga Ne has an orange sign with no English name on it so must be authentic (right?). The best part of grabbing Korean food is all the apps that comes with the meal - seriously who doesn't love free apps? The apps were mediocre, if anything it's worse than the other ones I've had. The kimchi was more sour than it was spicy and each piece was huge. I felt like a cow chewing on cud trying to stuff that piece down. I just gave up eating it before I embarrass myself like dropping in onto myself. I got the kam ja tang and he got the kimchi ji gae. I specifically asked for my kam ja tang to be spicy but it came out on the edge of being hot and lack of spice. From my experience, kam ja tang's usually come out pipping hot - like boiling, bubbles, burn your mouth hot. The plus was it did have a lot of meat and no potatoes (yay for carnivores!). The kimchi ji gae wasn't anything.

The staff is really friendly but they didn't check up on us ): they did check on other tables (I've noticed they were Korean) sad! Extra star for tatami mats! 

Overall, mediocre food, friendly service, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Service is not good if you do not speak Korean. Asked for water 4 times and did not get it. After 1 hr of eating, we had gotten the bill, packed up what we haven't finished eating and left because I was super thirsty lol. 
Luckily this place is super close to home. 
Super convenient location; there is free street parking after 9pm. We ordered the cooking top pork belly. It's similar to Korean BBQ but you get your own personal cook top for the pork belly. The pieces were super thin and it was my first time so I cooked mine too crispy. However the portions are huge, it could feed 4 people!! 
It comes with lettuce and some sauce and a bowl of tofu stew."}
{"text":"Hitting up a new restaurant in Koreatown has been on my to-do list for a while, and yesterday night I finally crossed it off my list! We couldn't find the restaurant that was recommended to us, so we just wandered into Lim Ga Ne since the menu seemed good and it was pretty busy inside. I wish I could say it was an amazing culinary experience, but it didn't leave me satisfied.  

I had the Bulgogi Jungsik, which is thinly sliced beef and some veggies cooked in a \"special sauce\".  Unfortunately, this sauce wasn't so special as much as it was bland.  I also got to try my boyfriend's dish, which was the Pork Bone Soup.  It was better than my dish, but be warned, it's spicy! My favourite part of the dinner were the side-dishes that come with every plate.  The spicy pickled radishes and the tasty rice were by far the highlights of our meal.  

Overall, the service could have been better and the restaurant itself is not the most attractive, but at least the prices are cheap!  I don't think I would return, however, I did enjoy watching the funny Korean game shows they had playing on the TV!"}
{"text":"One of the more authentic Korean restaurants in Toronto. It was the first Korean restaurant I tried in this area and was really impressed. It came with a lot of side dishes that had great variety. The rice that came with meals was the purple kind, which I rarely find even at Owl.  They used to give out a free flat egg omelette with soy sauce back then per table. The prices are also significantly lower than others, i.e. stews would be around 8 dollars as opposed to 10 - 11 dollars elsewhere but portions are still good. 

I recently ordered the spicy beef and vegetable stew. I was glad they used the right beef brisket, as opposed to others who just use easier beef slices. It was indeed spicy and I believed there could be more layers of flavour."}
{"text":"The food is decently good here but the service is not that great.

The food: I tried the bulgogi, kimchi chigae, ddeokbokki, mandu and soon tofu chigae. All of these items are decently good. I like how the soups come out piping hot and the bulgogi comes out steaming on a sizzling plate. Everything is hot and fresh.

The seats: There are both regular tables or traditional korean floor seating. I really prefer regular tables over floor seating because it is sometimes not comfortable for me and it is just a personal preference. I have long legs and my legs get numb sitting crosslegged really fast.

The service/atmosphere: Not that great at all especially when they are busy. I had to ask three different waitresses to get a refill of tea. There also isn't that much space to stand when you wait and the entrance kind of gets overcrowded."}
{"text":"In this neighbourhood the choices are plentiful if you're looking for Korean food. Presumably because it's known as koreatown. I know. Shocking. Sometimes the deciding factor when choosing somewhere to eat is service, and for me the best service I get when I eat in this neighbourhood is Lim Ga Ne. Mike is the man and he knows his shit. Extra attention is paid to all tables, he doesn't wait for you to ask to refill banchan dishes and he makes sure that your bbq doesn't burn. This is my dude. 

It's honest Korean food with no pretension. What sets it apart is the exceptional service."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food here which what matters to me the most since there were things that were a little off.

I'll get the off things out of the way:
1. A lot of people had reviewed and tipped in Yelp that they gave free seafood pancake as appetizer. They didn't give us any :(
2. We ordered the Jap Chae, which in the printed menu said had vegetables, but there was a handwritten portion that says it had beef. But ours didn't come with beef.

We ordered:
1. Dolsot Bibimbap $9.99
- This was very good. I always enjoy Dolsot Bibimbap and is one of the mostly-veggie dishes I can eat. Nice portion and very reasonable price. The hot sauce that comes with it for you to add as you wish isn't that hot though...

2. Kampungki (Fried Chicken with Sweet and Spicy Sauce) - $15.99
- I really loved how they did the chicken. Big crunchy chunks (like chicken pakora size if you are familiar with this) that are so juicy, tender and flavourful. Portions are big. My issue is with the sauce: it is a bit sweet and though it's supposed to be spicy too there was no hint of spicy whatsoever. 

3. Jap Chae - $14.99
- Really loved the noodles as it has the texture and chewiness that I look for in Jap Chae. The price is a little steep considering the portion isn't that big and there was no meat! So value-wise I don't see myself ordering this again since for $14.99 you can get seafood pancake or, for an extra $1, you get a big portion of Kampungki."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean cuisine.  Actually reminds me of the restaurants I'd eat at in Korea (except they don't carry the metal chopsticks).  

Eaten here twice.  Both times the food was amazing and the portion sizes were extremely generous.  The \"table cooking\" grill platters for 2 are definitely enough for 3 or 4 (if you're ordering other stuff on the side.  The Korean sausages were delicious.  And everything is perfectly seasoned.  Ate soooo much food last time and didn't feel bloated afterwards (rare for restaurants).  

Very reasonably priced too (after tax and tip came out to less than $20 / person).

For a more authentic experience, you can sit cross-legged at the low tables."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend night around 11pm. Lots of people in the store still. The food and service really failed to impress. Service was inattentive. The place is small so its a wonder how they don't see your hand waving. 

Food was nothing special. Pretty bland in my opinion. Yes I know I ordered a beef broth soup but it could at least have some beef flavour to it.. I felt like I was drinking cloudy hot water. Maybe I'll try something else next time.

Their kimchi was good, so that gives points. Other than that, I don't think I will be coming back but maybe if I ever do cause my companions want to, I'd order the pork bone soup to see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and they were regulars here so obviously we got good service. In fact, the owner pretty much ordered for us since they always order the same thing. We got spicy fried chicken, kbbq kalbi, and two soups that I didn't know the name of since I didn't even get to see a menu. They were also generous with banchans which were good, but I've had better at a few other places. We also ordered a bottle of Makkoli which was delicious even for a weak drinker like me. Overall I thought the food was quite good! Kalbi was well marinated in my opinion, I also like how the waitress makes sure everything is grilled properly. The soups were good too! They looked scary if you can't take spicy food, but wasn't that spicy in reality and went well with my rice. Same thing goes for the chicken. Though it was more spicy than the soup, the sauce was also slightly sweet too so it wasn't too bad. Overall I had a good time here, just wish it wasn't so cramped and small in there. Regardless I will probably return if given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Had pork bone soup here and the meat was fall off the bones good. The broth also tastes very authentic. The hot bowl that they use to contain the pork bone soup is different than other places and it is bigger. We had complimentary pan cakes which was a nice touch. It is pricier than other Korean restaurants though. Pork bone soup was $10."}
{"text":"Extremely rude waitress. I asked her if the fried rice has pork or beef and she shrugs and said she doesn't know and has such a bad attitude. She's the old one who can speak Chinese"}
{"text":"My positive review today is for the satisfying meal. This clean, no-frills place serves freshly-made and delicious Korean meals. Authentic and filling. Good choice of side dishes, which included an onion pancake. We ordered bibim naengmyun (cold noodles with vegetables) and kam ja tang (pork bone soup). The young lady serving tables was pleasant and quick, though the elderly lady did not have a smile or a nice word and seemed absolutely exhausted. It was nice that though the TV had a Korean game show playing, it was not blasted loudly. Most dishes seem reasonably priced, though I find $15 for chap chae (glass noodles with vegetables) pricey. I would probably return after having tried other places along the strip of Bloor between Bathurst and Christie, or if other places have a long wait."}
{"text":"Delicious comforting Korean food at reasonable prices. The pork bone soup, kimchi & pork fried rice & bulgogi table cooking are all good."}
{"text":"Good for late dinner! 
I came here 2 times..it might be a new restaurant bcoz I saw only few reviews. I like the food and the old lady who served us. I think it's family business!? Only 1-2 staffs serve! If its busy, u might have to wait for a while. Anyway, I'm ok with that point :) I like their service, especially open 24 hours :D  We want kimchi...
See you guys around!"}
{"text":"Cute small korean restaurant where you have an option to sit at a normal table or up on a wooden platform with cushions. Tv screens surrounding the small restaurant and at times they would play the recent popular k-drama. food is flavourful and delicious. servers are quick and friendly :)"}
{"text":"TL;DR Never met the most patient waitress at night until now. Never had the beat galbi of my life until now. Never had the best side dishes until now. I'm still drooling...

This is a place where you will either spend TOP DOLLAR FOR MEAT oR NOT AT ALL FOR TOP QUALITY DISHES. 

LISTEN TO ME. THE BEST $50 YOU COULD SPEND IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO FOR HIGH QUALITY GALBI IS HERE. THE PERFECT MARBLING OF FAT TO LEAN MEAT IS F*CKING BUTTER OK.BUTTER.

You guys probably watch all of those youtube or ig famous people on the net and wish oh but where can I get a slice of korea in toronto gee I wonder... HERE. GOHERENOW.

I had a whole bottle of soju to myself and a f*cking myriad of delicious, f*cking amazing side dishes ONTOP OF THE GODDAMN BEEF. dead. I'm dead.

You can tell the side dishes are homemade because literally everywhere else. All the side dishes taste the f*cking same. The soy sauce to the sesame oil... THE SAME. BUT GO TO THIS LIM GA NE LOCATION? You get DEDICATION, HARDWORK, SIDE DISHES THAT HAVE PERSONALITY, BANG FOR YOUR BUCK, and that godly K-drama unni/noona treatment from your server.

I can't do this anymore I'll just keep talking about this place for days about how good it is I need to stop NOW BUT I WONT ITS JUST SO GOOD. THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THE GRILLS. NO MY FRIENDS. noT AT ALL."}
{"text":"Didn't know it's name, thought I never visited this place.
so one day I decided to drive around Yonge street, and now I remember...

me and my co-workers was in the area looking for something to eat for dinner. checking out the places along Yonge street and this place seems okay, we got seated at the table near the front window, seems cramped.

the banchan wasn't enough for 5 people, well, may be we were just hungry, we cleared all of it before any of our dishes came.

except me and another guy, the rest of the group ordered Pork Bone Soup.
it's looks like regular Pork Bone Soup you see in any Korean restaurant.
didn't get to taste it, so didn't know how hot it would be, but I guess it's mild as even the guy who can't take the heat can finish it.

then came the Beef rib soup, it came in a milky white soup with some meat and some green onion in it.
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FLAVOR!
so we add some salt to it, then it starts to have a bit of flavor, mainly just salty taste.
I guess because there is almost no oil on the surface of the soup, and as people always say \"fat is flavor!\", that's probably why we can't taste anything in this soup.

(I had beef rib soup before, and I do know that you have to add salt to it so that the salt can bring out the flavor, but this place's beef rib soup really don't have any flavor.)

1/15"}
{"text":"Came with a couple friends as we were in the mood for Korean, and was told the food here is quite authentic. That's quite a statement when up and down the street, all you see are Korean restaurants. 

Walked in and the restaurant was quite busy. They don't have an overly large space, but have cute little tables on one side that are the short tables. Its a unique addition to the space, but glad that I wasn't sitting there for my meal to be honest.

We decided to go for the Pork Belly Tabletop Cooking, the Kimchi Tofu Hot Pot and Kimchi Fried Rice. We may have ordered a little too much food, but it was all quite delicious. 
First off, the pork belly was amazing. Great flavour with all the ingredients and side dishes you'd need for your lettuce wraps. I was really excited for this, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. Everything felt quite authentic to me for this dish. 
The hot pot was very good, with lots of rich kimchi flavour and was quite spicy. I did enjoy that, and liked that there were dumplings and meat inside too.
The fried rice was great as well! Probably didn't need to order that in retrospect, but glad we did.

Service was decent, as they were pretty busy. Got relatively good service as we had the tabletop cooking, so they did come to check up on the pork belly for us. They came relatively quickly when we did ring the bell for them though, which is good. 

Great option and would definitely come back in the future if I'm in the area. Does help as well that they are open 24 hrs. Kamsamnida!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the area. 
Recommend beef rib (kalbi tang) soup, bbq fish. 
Their kalbi is the best bbq beef rib I ever had in toronto.  Definitely recommend. 

Their potato side dish is also the best potato in toronto, not too sweet but very well marinated. 

At last, the walmae rice wine is my favorite drink amongst all. 

5 stars and definitely recommend, esp it's open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that I'm not a huge fan of Korean food outside of a couple of dishes.

My friend really wanted to try Korean sausage and heard that you can get it here. We had the Korean Sausage stew and pork hock.

The stew came in a boiling bowl and consisted of sausage and random pork offal. I wasn't a huge fan of this at all. It had a sort of gamey flavour.

The pork hock wasn't as soft as I'd like, but the flavour was good and I enjoyed eating it in lettuce wraps with garlic and jalapenos. 

The atmosphere is casual with a Korean music show blaring from the TV and special seating where you can eat at a low table on pillows.

The sides were pretty good and the service was friendly. Lots of people were having the pork bone soup, which is probably what I'll order if I come back here again."}
{"text":"It may have been the food I ordered but they just weren't great. 
I know some people really like it but not for me."}
{"text":"In Christie Korea town, I think this place is better than other restaurants. Since, the food is great and from starter, appetizer looks like a pancake is fresh, compare to other restaurants they over cook from the frozen food. You should definitely try a potato hotpot dish called, \" Gamjattang\" it's delicious and the beef is soft, just love it! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with Ryan T. after we saw that Owl of Minerva was packed. This place was packed, too, but they had a single table for two open, which we snatched right away.

To start they gave us a vegetable pancake thing, which was super tasty. I ordered the pork bone soup, which I thought was a bit pricey at $10 until I got it. It was GIGANTIC. Two meals, easy. It was very tasty, but the meat was not as fall-off-the-bone as I'm used to, which made eating it kind of difficult. 

Service was super fast, and there was a good variety of side dishes. I was quite interested in the varieties of soup that they had, so I might be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"So so good. The kimchi rice and fried chicken are to die for. Only downside is the wait but def worth it. My go to spot for Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a little bright - very plain cafeteria style seating - not much character in the exterior - but that food is amazing. Very taste bud friendly menu - I've had the pleasure of having everything on the menu (my wife's boss takes us out to dinner here often) - I'm not entirely familiar with Korean food, but have been to many Korean restaurants - and this is best and most affordable Korean BBQ I think of, based on my limited, inexperience Korean food opinion. I love their savoury pancakes and blood sausage. So good!"}
{"text":"This was a fun first Korean dinner experience. I loved all of the sides they brought out. The kimchi was super great and I really enjoyed the (soy?) pickled radish and jalapenos. 

I mostly relied on my friends to order since I was unfamiliar with the food. Unfortunately, they're mainly vegetarian so I didn't get to try any of the meats but everything was still really tasty.

While relatively small, they were still able to accommodate my 2-year-old niece and had a highchair for her. It was fun to have her take part in the communal dining experience with us. 

One huge shock to us was that our US credit card was not accepted there. I wish we had asked ahead of time since we had no cash on us. My husband found the nearest atm and we got it handled but I wish we would have asked or there had been a sign or something."}
{"text":"I was given the recommendation by zomato as this restaurant repeatedly showed up. My friend and I decided to go here and the price range is broad. Most dishes on the right side of the menu is mainly $30-$50 for two or more people. I got the kimchi stew and she got the pork bone stew. Unlike other restaurants, Lim Ga Ne is not stingy on the side dishes and they give you a good portion. They also give korean pancakes on the house. My kimchi stew was piping hot and delicious. Will come again."}
{"text":"First time i came here, it was a full house and i was a party of two. The server could have been a little more attentive, as he seemed more attentive to the loud party beside us. The service was slow, after waiting 15 minutes for menus, I got up to grab them myself.
we never got checked up on and it was hard to call for service. 
Regardless, food was good, and the complimentary korean pancake appetizers are to die for! They are made fresh before serving. 
Me and my partner's meal were delicious. Since then, we have decided to try them again and their service is a lot better, food quality is always consistent and those pancakes are the only reason me and my partner go back! 
Also, servers are very very friendly. 
I would recommend going here if you love korean food."}
{"text":"Been here twice and i think im coming back again! Love bringing my friends here, its worth the price and side dishes are free of charge. The waiter said you can choose which side dish you want them to refill. Love the hotpot too!! It's spicy like we wanted! Love the silken tofu on the hotpot plus a little bit of rice cakes! Worth your money guys. My fave korean eats in yonge"}
{"text":"This is another standard Korean restaurant in the Yonge/Finch area. All the typical dishes you can find elsewhere you can also find here. We had the budae jeonggol (army stew) hot pot ($25) and the Chicken Katsu ($10).

Both dishes were good. The chicken katsu in particular was HUGE! The chicken was breaded just the right way and was crispy. Army Stew is...army stew. It's basically a collection of the cheapest ingredients you can find but hey...who cares! It tastes good. It was almost enough to feed 3. Comes with 2 rice. 

My only minor complaint was that the tables that arrived later than us managed to get their side dishes first. There was only one server and I guess she was too busy. Price-value-quality factor is just \"ok\". If you're price sensitive, there are better options in the area. But this place is 24/7 so I guess the slightly higher price is justified."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on the fact that it was dinner time and we wanted an available restaurant that wasn't too empty but yet where we wouldn't have to wait for a table either.

It didn't take too long for our banchan (side dishes) to arrive.  I liked how the kimchi wasn't too spicy and was really good!

Once the bowls of Mul Naengmyun (cold buckwheat noodle) arrived, the server immediately cut up the noodles for us using his scissors.  

The broth was really good and I found the cold buckwheat noodles to taste a little firmer than the ones I've ever last time at Cho Sun Ok.  However, it was just as satisfying and delicious.  There was an egg and vegetables including sliced sweet pear in the cold clear broth.  Mmm!

K also ordered the cold buckwheat noodle but he got his with the combo which included a sizzling platter of beef short ribs.  I really liked how juicy and flavourful the beef short ribs were.  However, I did find a tad of them chewy.  They were so tender though! 

All in all, it was a good and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Actually I will give 3.5
While studying, i usually get hungry every 2,3 hours ...... And it happened again, so hungry at 11: 30 PM. with 2 chapters to be finished.  So i used it as an excuse to get a late, very late dinner.  
I went pass Lim Ga Ne several times, since I just live across the street. It has a very interesting logo and I noticed it is open 24 hours. 


The conclusion is :Not recommended for one person, here is why
11:30 pm this place is still packed, ie no table for one (sadly) and I waited for 10 mins. When i opened the menu, I found all the dishes I would like to order is for 2 ppl+, 
I was craving for the steam fish with bean sprouts in hot sauce, so I ordered that and the sweet and sour port sitting next table caught my eyes too so i ordered that as well.

Even though I've already made up my mind that I gonna pack it to go, when two place come up and occupied half of a 4 ppl sitting table, I still feel very embarrassing. So quickly packed to go.

Food wise, agree with the 3 star reviews, not very special , at least for the dish i ordered. I expect the fish to be more spicy. 

But, I will definitely come back with friends. The special seat style they have inside, the noise reminds me a lot of the Korean restaurant in China, where I was hanging out with friends from high school.

So, not being objective here ~ but who can always be ~~"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Go elsewhere. Some ingredients were close to perished and when bite into it, I literally had to spit it out. We tried Bossam (steamed pork dish) which was decent, but the SoonDaeGook......it was completely disgusting. The chef had no sense of hygiene, he was preparing food in the kitchen and literally hand fed one of the staffs out in the hall and went back in the kitchen. Just in general, the staff and the chef did not seem to care about the basic sanitation."}
{"text":"So disappointing.. Considering I have been their customers for the past four or five years..it used to be my all time favourite until recently end of last year .. Their food started to taste different. And don't get me wrong it is still good.. But different not as good as what it was before. I used to drink their black goat soup, sweet and sour chicken and also their beef BBQ..
The most disappointing one was my all time favourite black goat soup.. They made it so different now.. I don't think I will go back as much anymore"}
{"text":"This was the best Korean meal I have ever had. The side dishes were delicious and were replenished as soon as we finished them. The menu is enormous and it was pretty busy. It is not cheap, as our galbi and bulgogi BBQ was $40 each, but with that, we got rice and two big pots of soup. There was four of us, and we ordered a beer each, a seafood pancake and two types of BBQ and we were unbuttoning our pants at the end of it. It was $32 each altogether, which I think is what you would pay for a decent, very filling meal. I know there are way more affordable BBQs and Korean restaurants around but  this was a really nice meal (and BIG) with REALLY good food. I will definitely be going again to try their huge selection of soups and stews."}
{"text":"After coming here a few more times, I am definitely liking their food a lot more. Favs include the cold noodles and the pork bone soup. IMO they have one of the best pork bone soups in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Better than expected! I've visited a handful of restaurants at K-Town and this is one of the better ones there. Gotta try their BBQ marinated pork and ribs!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. Basically because my wife seemed to really enjoy her Kimchi Stew, while my cold buckwheat noodles were just okay.

The stew stayed piping hot, and she said it was one of her Faves along Bloor West. My cold noodles were tasty, but after half way I got really bored of it.

Next time I'd come with a bigger group and try their big pot of noodles."}
{"text":"None of the Korean restaurants right at the corner of Yonge/Finch can beat this one, which was what my Korean friend told me, and I do agree.

The food here is a bit more tastier, more flavourful, with more spices.

I like that they are open 24 hours so you have an option other than Owls/Nakwons if you are ever awake and hungry that late.

Mind you they dont get five stars because I eat Korean food often in the city and there are plenty others which I enjoy more.

But it's still a good choice for this intersection and I wouldn't mind coming back often."}
{"text":"This place is a great little spot that is open 24/7 but honestly the service is so terrible. ( The ladies are really nice but there's this one man at cash who is just absolutely terrible)

First of all they messed up my order, and while we were waiting, my friend's order included an ingredient that he was allergic to. The menu listed what was in the dish so we ordered based off that information. Unfortunately it was only until the dish came out that we realized that the menu was incorrect. We told them nicely indicating that my friend was allergic and was expecting that they would remake the dish. Not only did they not want to remake it, they insisted that I had to pay for both items! It was only after a heated argument that they said they would only switch the item for something cheaper, which we agreed to. Obviously before we were finished our meal, the same man gave us our bill indicating to us to leave. The food was okay but the service was so terrible I would never return again."}
{"text":"A decent Korean food joint in Korean town Toronto

The inside decor is pretty good, with \"kneeling tables\" on one side that looked pretty neat, as well as a TV playing korean drama, which the wait staff was watching when they were on break :) The food is pretty good as well--the pork bone soup had large pieces of pork bones, and the \"snack dishes\" they give out at the start are also pretty tasty--the free pancakes at the start didn't hurt either :)

Overall, a decent Korean food joint in North Ktown"}
{"text":"Here waitress is very rude. The rudest person I ever seen! She is young one, and tall with very weird make up. Also she can speak Korean. 
Her behavior was really rude to customer.
I'm not gonna come to this resturant anymore or I will come to here when she is not working at here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant in all of Toronto. Fast and friendly service, delicious food, and the best prices you can find. The ah joo mas are super cute and not stingy with the banchan (side dishes) at all. Food comes super fast and it's always hot and fresh. It's always really busy here on the weekends starting at dinner time so be prepared to wait especially if you don't want to sit on those traditional floor seats.

My recommendations: soon dubu, gamjatang, kimchi fried rice (tastes like butter), naengmyun with kalbi.

Also this place is 24/7!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for kbbq in downtown. The price is reasonable for the amount of meat. My favorite is the beef short ribs with soybean paste soup! The place is usually busy so make sure to reserve head of time."}

{"text":"Good friendly Korean restaurant that's open 24 hours.  Food was good and came promptly after ordering.  Half of the restaurant had the traditional floor seats where you had to cross your legs in order to sit at the table which can be inconvenient for some.

They seem to have trouble understanding English, but just a little bit of patience and you should be fine.  (E.g. my friend asked if he can keep the cup for water and they nodded and took away his cup....lol)"}
{"text":"Pretty great korean restaurant, I found the service to be quick and sweet. I ordered the kimchi jigae, food was delicious, my favourite on the Yonge finch corner so far. The prices are average. I would recommend getting there early as it gets super busy. I will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place after strolling by and the food smells attracted us. I was hesitant to try this place because it has received a conditional pass many times prior and wanted to go to sunrise house down the street. However, they were closed and I had not eaten all day so I was ready to eat anything. I had the kimchi fried rice (number 14 )and my girlfriend had a soup. 

This review is based off my experience. 

The appetizer started out great. We got a fresh pancake and the usual Korean sides. My dishes came prompt and everything was going well until I had my first bite of the kimchi fried rice - the meat was hard and lukewarm. I just thought they over cooked the beef. I finished the rest of the dish and went home.

Now the fun part happened the next day, I spent the whole day on the toilet. First time getting sick at a Korean place. Good job Lim Ga Ne!"}
{"text":"This place serves delicious food! Their portions are generous especially their pork bone soup! Usually, restaurants just add lots of potato to fill the dish up but not Lim Ga Ne. They made sure I had my share of meat! My personal fave is their DEEP FRIED CHICKEN IN SPECIAL  SAUCE. Must try. Plus, I am really happy with their good service!

*we also got the Steamed Soft Beef Knee with Green Onion. This was soso. Don't recommend it for non-fatty eaters. 

*will def come back!"}
{"text":"We are regulars. Always have that Korean homey feel. Loved that. Food is always tasty, spiced, awesome. Good location as well. Favorites are La Kalbi and GamJaTang.
My boyfriend love the sides so much he always ask for refills lol. Price is right. Would definitely recommend.

Didnt give 5 star coz there's room for improvement. Ambiance is fine but they can do better."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night dinner last night with the lovely Anastasiya.

We came here mostly to try some new banchans (other than what you get at Nak Won..)

Aside from the banchans, I ordered the

1. Kamjatang : Pork Bone Soup? YES PLEASE. It was amazing. SO MCUH MEAT. I couldn't finish. It was delicious. I think I like it more than I like it over at Nak Won 5/5

2. Kalbitang : Short Ribs soup? YES PLEASE. But it was super dissapointing. The broth had no real flavour, but it was chock ful of addons : Glass Noodles, Shrooms, Green Onions, etc. 2/5 

The Banchans were okay. Definitely not as good as Nak Wons. I did like the fish cake here better than Nak Wons, but Nak Won has a better variety.

I'll probs be back for the delicious PBS."}
{"text":"Delicious and open 24 hours, went  recently after a night of drinking.

Place was packed but servers were still friendly. My companions got pork bone soup and fried rice. All the staples plus a few extra I don't see around often, their soon dae (intestine sausages).

Food came out nice and hot with lots of side dishes. My sister asked for spicy and she got it :)

Definitely go, after hours or non vampire hours!"}
{"text":"Great food, open late, and the sweetest staff. Despite being rammed full, our waitress was super warm, patient and took time to recommend and explain the food (which was delicious). Definitely making this a regular late night spot."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 7.5/10

I had the soondae guk here as I have been craving it for quite sometime, it didn't really hit the spot though, and the flavours weren't as good as many other places I've been to around the GTA. I did like the kimchi here, it had the right amount of saltiness and tartness. I managed to try the gam ja tang and that was seasoned much better than the soondae guk. The side dishes are a little salty for my taste. 

The service here is a little slow but there was nothing to really complain about.

The atmosphere is very plain and the seating was a little awkward since we had a relatively large group of people.

The prices as others have said are a bit higher than the nearby locations and I definitely think you can find better value at other Korean restaurants. 

I feel like they need to cut down on the number of dishes they have, and focus on their best items. The portion sizes are good and some of their items are worth it, but a larger menu makes it so that not all dishes get the quality they are due. 

This place is a OK restaurant, but I feel like I can definitely find better options nearby."}
{"text":"I had no idea how to eat their Bossam at first too. I tried to eat them separately but everything tasted meh on their own. So I had no choice but to ask the waitress who was walking around. She was nice about it. She took my chopsticks and started showing me how to pile a little bit of everything onto a single lettuce leaf. First she ripped off a piece of lettuce leaf and placed 1 slice of steamed pork on the lettuce, then some oysters, then some sweet kimchi. I put the whole concoction in my mouth and ... it was strange but I would consider it good! The best part, the oyster no longer tasted too fishy.
For pics of how the waitress put the bossam together - http://www.fringta.com/2011/10/lim-ga-ne-5529-yonge-st.html"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was busy when we arrived. We were fortunate and only waited 10 minutes before being seated. The focus of this restaurant is mainly bbq meat. My companions tried the bibimbap and pork bone soup and said it was ok. I had the kalbi and really enjoyed it as the meat was flavourful and the portions were fair.

There really wasn't any service as they basically took our orders, brought us the food and then the bill.  Otherwise we were left alone for most of the night.

Note that the prices here are pretty reasonable but not cheap so if you're looking for some cheap eats this is probably not the best choice. 

I would recommend this place if you have a meat craving and don't mind smelling like bbq afterwards."}
{"text":"I have been on a Korean food binge lately and came across Lim Ga Ne while in the area. Decided to come with my family because my mom wanted to try a variety of Korean dishes (she likes to cook). The first dish we received was a complimentary pancake appetizer, a nice yummy touch I appreciated. Then we had the bibimbap I usually love to order, which I sadly did not love at this restaurant. Felt it was a bit bland and missing a certain \"jena se quai\" - Korean style. Our third dish was hot noodles, also fine but nothing I would usually order as I typically eat that at home.

Finally we reach my last dish, the samgapsal! For about $35, you can get this combo with a complimentary stew. I chose kimchi stew because I love kimchi and thought it might taste good. I was wrong, so wrong. I would not recommend this when ordering, it tasted like kimchi and water... JUST THAT. However, the samgapsal was really good! The meat's tender and soft, definitely filling for two or three people. Wrap up the meat with lettuce and kimchi, dip in sauce provided and let the foodie-liciousness of it take over! :D

Service was good, my table was taking a long time to order but our server was nice enough not to show her impatience. Especially since it got noticeably busier later on.

Overall, I would definitely visit again if just for the samgapsal and rice dishes. I do suggest making reservations if you plan on dining in the evening though, I think it gets busier then."}
{"text":"Little nice Korean restaurant near Yonge and Finch. The sign is orange and is only in Korean. One of the better about this place is that it is 24 hours so if it's a cold, chilly winter night and you're craving Korean, you can always come by here. The prices are cheaper than other Korean restaurants which is a plus (about $1 cheaper than usual), but the food is alright. I didn't find anything too special about the food here. There are \"tatami\" tables where you can take off your shoes and get super comfy, but its just a table on wood floors.

I ordered the yukgaejang (spicy beef soup) which had a nice balance of beef and veggies. The flavour wasn't beefy enough and it was more of just a salt flavor than anything. Looking at their spicy soups, the colour seemed a bit off. The spiciness is fairly mild compared to other Korean restaurants. 

I probably would come again, but only out of convenience since it is close to where I live and its 24 hours. Service was good. Just note that the place doesn't take card unless your bill is over $30."}
{"text":"A korean restaurant that is maybe $1-2 more expensive than others. The food was good, but definitely could find a place that's just as tasty but cheaper. Nothing much to say - it was pretty average!"}

When you order it, they bring it tableside on a burner. Let it cook for awhile then enjoy the nomnom. Side dishes are good too. Will come back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a late night meal. It's cheap, the staff is friendly and it tastes good. I recommend the kimchi fried rice and the dumpling soup. They're both pretty classic dishes and you really can't go wrong with them. 

When is the best time to come to this place? I'd say after midnight. It's hard to explain but this place gives you really good vibes when you're sharing a meal with your friend(s) and talking into the night."}
{"text":"Decent place for some Korean food. There is a floor seating area which I cannot stand, so we had to wait for quite a while. Ordered bbq table cooking which was around the same price as nearby restaurants. The meat and side dishes were both enjoyed, especially the potatoes!!! However, we had ask the server for our rice and the onion salad for the wraps. This knocked down a star. Maybe an off day. Good place doe"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars for the Gamjatang - there is SO much pork, there were two whole potatoes (Nak Won has like one and a half...it makes a big difference believe it or not), the port is sprinkled with mustard seeds and chopped green onions. The broth isn't as spicy as Nak Won which was a big plus because sometimes I feel like I'm burning a hole through my stomach...

It's pretty packed for dinner but people move fast, we only had to wait once for about 5-7 min.

I came here one night/morning at 4am - definitely a much better drunken food alternative than McDonald's! 

Seating is either at regular tables/booths or on the floor (I KNOW! how rebellious and Korean of them...). I never sat on the floors - I have a theory that if I'm not sitting in the proper position my stomach will not be able to fit as much food as I want :))

THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE - there are no potatoes or noodles on the banchan \"menu\". I wanted to leave right there and then....  Suposedly they have this pancake on the menu but so far 3/3 times it has just been a legend to me. I have not seen, smelt or tried this pancake. For all I know it doesn't exist!!!! WHY WOULD THEY DECEIVE ME LIKE THIS!?!!?!?

Banchan - dried anchovies with peanuts, pickled radish, kim chi, kim chi like green onions, fishcake, sprouts, big pieces of radish with chili powder on top.

I wish I could take Nak Won in one hand, Lim Ga Ne in the other hand and just smoosh them together - it would be there perfect Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I deduct one star just for the waitress with bad attitude but overall is so good. I saw many Korean in there which means it is traditional Korean food! Still Love here~~"}
{"text":"My go to place for Korean sausage,  soon dae. The Korean sausage stew soon dae guk is amazing. Anyways would recommend this place. They even give wicked side dishes banchan. They give you Korean pancakes Pa jeon. Made just right not too soggy. A little crispy."}
{"text":"With so many other good options around, I don't see why anyone should go to this restaurant. It is extremely dirty. In the summertime you can use the back entrance and experience the putrid smell of rotting food radiating from the kitchen. This place is a disgrace to Korean cuisine. Go to the nearby Huh Ga Ne!"}
{"text":"Good sides and services.
But I won't say I enjoyed the barbeque pork belly. The sauce does not have enough flavour."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean place in the area.
LOVE the spicy chicken, SO good.
Nice servers, great side dishes, fast food.
Clean space."}
{"text":"Menu: https://www.zomato.com/toronto/lim-ga-ne-north-york/menu#tabtop
(Yes I'm linking another review site, Yelp really needs to implement a menu page for each restaurant...)

What we had: duk bo ki (spicy ricecakes), kam ja tang (pork bone soup), kimchi bokeumbap (kimchi fried rice)

Note: Normally we would have rated this place 3 stars, but after eating here, Steven and I both had upset stomach (the meal at Lim Ga Ne was the only thing we shared that day, so we put 1 + 1 together, got 3, and concluded that it was likely linked to something we ate there), so I'm taking off a star. The food wasn't visibly expired and didn't taste like it was expired, so we aren't sure which item disagreed with our stomachs.

Taste: 7/10

I really wanted to find a place that serves duk bo ki as spicy and delicious as Home of Hot Taste, but Lim Ga Ne is another candidate crossed off the list. Their duk bo ki was mostly sweet and barely spicy at all. Even Steven said it was barely spicy, and he has pretty low spice tolerance. 

The kam ja tang was pretty good with a nice meaty flavour and they gave plenty of pork bones. Although the meat could be more tender; one should not have to wrestle the bones apart to get to the meat in between (the best part! Or maybe that's just me).

The kimchi fried rice came with a sunny side up egg, which was delicious. It was quite oily, even for fried rice. The portion was generous, we could barely finish it.

They gave plenty of side dishes, most of them were on the salty side so we could not eat them on their own.  The potatoes were pretty good, its too bad they didn't give any vermicelli .

Value: 8/10

$8 for pork bone soup, $10 for fried rice, 9$ for the rice cakes.  Similar to most other korean restaurants.  We could have been full without the rice cakes.

**Average cost per diner: $13-18 after tax+tip (depending on if you share appetizers)

Service/Convenience: 7/10

This place was easy to find with its front door facing Yonge St. The place has regular tables and traditional looking tables where you have to sit on the floor. There were plenty of tables available when we entered and we were seated quickly. The food is delivered fairly quickly, however when we needed more napkins we found it easier to just grab it ourselves at the counter. I would say the service is efficient, but don't expect to get fawned over by any of the ajummas there.

Would go back? Probably not.

Would recommend to friend? Nope, not going to risk giving my friends upset stomach too.

Similar places: Nak Won, most of the Korean restaurants around the Yonge & Finch area

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"I accidentally dropped my napkin and the server came to pick it up off the floor. She then refolded it in front of me and placed it back on my table expecting me to use it. THE NAPKIN HAD TOUCHED THE FLOOR!! I looked at my friend in shock as she walked away and he gave me a look of, \"yup, that just happened.\" We didn't tip her and she ended up asking for a tip. No tip for insulting service."}
{"text":"Came here one super sunny afternoon and was clearly in dire need of cooling down. Anyways, all joking aside, I took a quick through their menu and of course my eyes landed on the noodles section. All the noodles in that section are all cold noodle options. I wanted bibim naengmyeon and LA galbi ($13.50) so I got that.

The bibim naengmyeon comes out with buckwheat noodles neatly piled into a metal steel bowl then layered with thinly sliced pickled radish, asian pear and strips of julienne cucumbers. The broth and the gochujang sauce comes separate so you can add the right amount of both to you desired liking. I really like that since some people might not like their bibim naengmyeon soaking in broth (order the mul naengmyeon if you want lots of broth!) or too over spicy. Sadly I forgot to take a picture after it was all mixed...oops.

The LA galbi came out on a sizzling plate which was great. The meat was nice, tender and very well marinated. The meat practically felt off the bone, the cartilage part that was left on the bone was very chewy but very delicious, the marinade marinated so well into all of the meat that I have no complains.

Banchan was the usual but OMG the pajeon was incredible! It was so so so good. A simple onion pancake with some red peppers added, it was so fluffy and full of flavour. The other banchan was kimchi, pickled radish with jalapenos and fishcake.

I will definitely come back again. Service was impeccable too. The waitress also helped me with the bibim naengmyeon since it had been a while since I had it and I never got it unmixed so I wasn't really sure what to do. Good job Lim Ga Ne."}
{"text":"Hm. The reviews here for Lim Ga Ne are... interesting. Especially since they contrast quite a bit from my own experience. 

First of all, I am Korean. I grew up on Korean food, ate mom's cooking, lots of other Korean mother's cooking, LA Korean food, and most recently NY Korean food, so I think I have a bit of background in Korean food.

First of all, this place is not a Korean BBQ place. Although they offer BBQ, if you really want BBQ, you should go to a place with soot bul BBQ (charcoal BBQ). 

I did not have their naengmyun, so I will not comment on that.

1st: banchan (side dishes, comes free): Lim's actually puts out about 6 sides, which is more than most. From my 3 experiences there, they had 3 types of kimchee: regular napa cabbage, radish cubes, and leafy green kimchee, bean sprouts, seaweed, slimy hot stuff which i think is squid, but i'm not sure, and I didn't really like it. Overall, the spread was decent, and tasted good (except for the slimy squid). Of note, I really liked their kimchee. It was not overly fermented, and packed a powerful punch. One of the best kimchee's on bloor. One great bonus about this place is that they also give you some pieces of pa jun, (flour pancake with veggies in it, served with soy sauce), which will cost you $5-8 dollars for a full one at other restaurants. Nice bonus.

2: My favorite here is the spicy beef brisket soup (yook gae jang. It IS spicy, for those of you who can't handle spicy foods, you probably want to stay away. However, for those of you who CAN handle it, there is probably nothing better in the chill of autumn and winter, then to sit down to this soul-warming soup. It will fog up your glasses and make you sweat, and that's a GOOD THING. It is hearty, filling, and extremely flavorful. The brisket is appropriately pulled apart along the grain, not cut across. The 2nd most important ingredient, goh sah ri (baby fern), lends this dish the... I'm not sure how to describe it, other than that it has an earthy/mountain plant taste, that comes only from this plant. Other places will skimp this, skip it altogether, or not soak it long enough, leaving it hard. Not Lim's. I've had this dish 3x, came out perfectly each time. In addition, there are bean sprouts, vermicelli noodles, garlic, etc. 

3. dolsot bibimbab (stone pot bibimbap). Usual medley of veggies and spoonful of ground meat. It was ok, usual fare.

4. Fish. Now, I am personally not a lover of fish. But most ppl don't know that Koreans eat fish quite frequently, and especially in the manner that Lim's serves it: Heavily salted and grilled. Most ppl don't eat this to be filled by the fish. You eat a small amount of fish at a time with your rice, that's why the fish are generally small (although it's bigger here than the ones my mom usually gets), and heavily salted. 

5. Kimchi jji gae. (kimchee stew). This is one of the ways that I personally grade a korean restaurant, and Lim's comes through with flying colors. Kimchi chi gae can go wrong in several ways: It can be made of overly fermented kimchi (making it extremely sour), it can be make of too fresh/raw kimchi, it can have inadequate meat flavor (usually needs pork bone base, or ssam kyup sal (3-layer pork), for necessary meat flavor. Lim's kimchi jji gae has none of these deficiencies. It was not mindblowing, but pretty good nonetheless.

Price: Lim's is about $1-2 more expensive than the \"bun shiks\" (korean version of fast food/snack restaurants) Thumb bun shik, Seoul bun shik. 

Oh yeah, they don't always have English-speaking waiters/waitresses there, which might be an issue. One of the times I was there, there was a tall skinny korean dude who spoke excellent English, practically explaining every dish to a caucasian family. I don't know how often he is there.

Overall, good value, good service, tasty food. I wish it was a little closer, and not all the way at the west end of Bloor-Koreatown, but that's a different issue."}
{"text":"It was a late night after Casa Loma escape room and we didn't know where to go get food. We drove all over town and couldn't find any place open. Luckily we called this place and honestly it was AMAZING. They open 24/7 and the food portion here is huge. Most of the stew portion are for two people and so is everything else except the first page. That portion is basically for one but even then, it's a good price for what you're getting. The service was great, though that probably because one of our friend speaks korean or else the waitress has a hard time understanding us. Though she was super fast with food and water. She even gave one of our friend extra rice free of charge! If you're looking for a late night or even just good korean food place, this is the one! Although the space inside is kinda small so it might be hard to get a table on a busy night."}
{"text":"It's only my second time going to this restaurant, but it's amazing.  It gives you a very \"homey\" feeling when you walk in.  The ban chans are amazing - different types and they also give you a seafood pancake.

I got my usual: soon tofu chigae.  You can't go wrong with that.  They also provide you with the purple healthy rice that comes with it.

I can't complain -- good price and you're always full and happy when walking out! Love it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by these reviews.  In fact I wasn't going to bother to review this place because it's always so packed with people I assumed they'd already have a huge list of good reviews.  This is basically an echo of Jacob's review but I needs to put my two cents in.
I've only had really good meals here.  I don't order kalbi and mul naeng myun because they don't specialize in it and I'm convinced you have to go to L.A. or Flushings, NY or my mother's house to eat these things properly.  I go straight for the stews which are really great!  Get the Kimchi Jigae Jungol (family style kimchi jigae) and their bosam.  The kimchi jigae is really the best I've had on bloor and their bo-sam came with really fresh oysters and good slices of pork belly and spicy radish moochim.  The pahn-chan is really the best on Bloor street like Jacob in the previous review mentioned.
Service is best when their son is working (Super \"tall skinny dude\" ).  When my folks arrive to a lineup here and there is no place to sit and wait he'll ask my parents if they'd like to wait in their heated car (forgive them for killing the earth with their idling gas fumes).  He will then walk the block over in the cold to let them know a table is open for them.  He really breaks the bad service tradition most people experience when they eat Korean which mainly stems from language barriers.  
I dunno, maybe it's 'cause I mainly dine here with the parents that I've never had a bad meal.  If that's the case that I extend an open invitation* to anyone that would like to join me and my folks here for dinner 'cause it's really that good!

*you can eat we us and my parents will probably foot the bill but in return we expect fan dancing and deep formal new year bows in return. dig it? dug it."}
{"text":"I go there for once a week . 
Their food and services just like my back home. 
I love all staff inc owner .
Lots of side dish and their food potion is amazing .
Always so generous .

I definitely recommend to everyone who wants try Korean food !"}
{"text":"It's a normal Korean restaurant the food are decent, the prices are reasonable but I think they don't have split the bill as well"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service is what kills it every time. I'm Korean so no favouritism, racism nor prejudice. I can honestly say the younger kids working there are great but the older woman/women are the absolute worst when it comes to service. 
It almost makes me not want to come back but the hours are good and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better 24/7 Korean restaurants in the area.. the side dishes are always great (my favorite is fish cake) , the pork bone soup is tender and flavorful and the service is fast and great! The price is on par with the other food in town. I would not recommend sitting on the shorter tables where you need to sit on the floor.. it looks nice but you may find it difficult to get food if you are at the other end of the table"}
{"text":"Lim Ga Ne is generally the most preferred Korean BBQ spot when talked amongst friends. Having been here several times in the past, here is my recent visit review. We chose Lim Ga Nee as our birthday dinner location a couple weeks ago. We were able to put in a reservation for 13 people with relative ease. The staff was accommodating of the time, and took down all the necessary information. 

On the day of the dinner, the restaurant was packed, but they were able to set us up with several tables. The only complaint I had was the awkward location of our group, we were seated pretty close to the middle of the restaurant, when in the past, most party groups are reserved at a more logical location within the restaurant near the kitchen. Hence it was slightly tight in space, but it was simply an oversight.

The food we ordered were several KBBQ favourites, including galbi, pork belly, and beef bulgogi. The service was quick, and the food was deliciously marinaded. The combination of the meat and the greens provided proved to be an excellent flavour. The complimentary soups were also an added bonus. Furthermore, the staff was active in filling water, and fulfilling everyone's requests, such as extra sauce or napkins. Only thing I would've loved is the inclusion of some traditional Korean side dishes, as the selection of things to eat were limited.

What made this place garner a high review is the level of service it provided. We brought in a cake to cut, and the staff was very accommodating with clearing the table for the cake, providing additional cutleries, and providing lighters for the candles. They were brilliant in making our birthday event effortless. Combined with the good food and service, I would return to this place once again in the future."}
{"text":"My order: Kalbi beef KBBQ & soju

Pros
Staff: Attentive and friendly 
Food: Delicious and fresh 

Cons
Seating: this isn't really a con, but it is standard for Koreans to sit on mats and take off their shoes. So mentally prepare for that! 
Parking: or therelackof. Get your coins/credit cards out to pay for parking!"}
{"text":"24 hour place with decent food for those who have had a long night and crave kimchi stew at 7am."}
{"text":"YUM.

Came here with my Korean compatriot, looking for some BBQ - we will be back!

Ordered the JUMULUK, which is my favourite KBBQ meat option. I just think of it as high quality thicker cuts of beef. No bones to contend with like kal bi, not thin and measly like bulgogi, and not so fatty as samgyeopsal (which, granted, is pork). Definitely give the jumuluk a try.

$40 all-in gets you a surprisingly good spread of banchan, your choice of stew, and the meat plus fixings. It was way too much food for two people.

Stew/soup options were either kimchi chigae (cooked kim chi) or doenjang chigae (fermented soybean). Don't be put off by the description of the latter, as the flavour profile is typically phenomenal. I'm actually not a fan of kimchi chigae - something about the taste of cooked kimchi just puts me off; but my gf loves it and she thought this version was well done. 

The meat arrived with the usual fixings: sesame oil and ssamjang; sliced garlic and chili pepper; rice and lettuce. Assembly: (1) tear off a palm-sized piece of lettuce; (2) lay down a base of rice; (3) take one piece of beef; (4) dip beef lightly in the sesame oil [there is salt and pepper at the bottom of the oil dish]; (4) beef onto rice; (5) ssamjang on top; (6) add sliced garlic [that you've heated on the grill] and the chili pepper if you so desire; (7) devour. Repeat until you hate yourself and want to die. Yes, the quantity of food for two people was that plentiful.

Don't even think of going to an AYCE KBBQ place."}
{"text":"It was not a good experience for me. I love Korean food, but not this place. Side dishes seemed 'used', table was dirty, and food was worse than so so. They didn't even care about their service. It was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Got seated in the area where you take your shoes off and side crossed legged, it was an interesting experience. The food was delicious, I always get soon dubu jiggae (tofu soup) at every restaurant and this one was not too salty and had the right amount of spice. The only issue I had was the wait time and the wait space. It is a small area at the front and people get shoved outside near the entrance. Overall would recommend just be prepared for the wait time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but it failed to please. Maybe it was the type of dish I ordered. I'm sure they have other great dishes here like the BBQ but its really hard to mess up BBQ. Got a pork bone soup and Soy bean paste soup with seafood. The pork bone soup was good - no real complaints her. Lots of meat and piping hot soup just like any other Korean restaurants. The soup itself was not that spicy but I will give it 4/5 stars. The bean paste soup with seafood was also decent but the tofu just doesn't compare to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. I will give this dish 3/5 stars. The real disappointment were the side dishes. I know the side dishes are free but its part of the meal and should represent otherwise. It came with 7 side dishes: bean sprout, kimchii, pancake, fried fish cake, radish, glass noodle and some kind of green veggie. I could describe how disappointed I am with each side dish but that would make this review the length of the bible. In short, they were not seasoned well and didn't seem that fresh. This is the first time not finishing all side dishes. I usually ask for seconds too but not this time. One positive is the price. $8 for each dish I ordered and taxes were included already.

Just as a note:
If you plan on sitting on the elevated floor seating, remember these pointers. Take off your shoes - I didn't know this was necessary and was told by the waitress. I felt like I had violated a law or something but it was definitely my bad. Wear comfy pants - My guest was wearing jeans that were too tight so she couldn't cross her legs and ended up sticking them straight underneath the table which made my meal less enjoying as I had to deal with frigidity feet for the whole time."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant because of its convenient location, right at Yonge and Finch, and because they have mat seating on the floor for the tables by the wall which I think are fun. Their ban chans are pretty tasty (I think they give you around 6 plates) and their seafood soon tofu soup is especially good so if you're not sure what to get, try it!!"}
{"text":"Food is average here. Only thing that stands out is their kimchi fried rice but it's often a hit or miss"}
{"text":"I came here twice.  Double meh.

First time, had one of the hotpot dishes.  Super filling, kinda spicy, but really nothing special. Second time came for a dinner at midnight and got the soon tofu dish.. again, mediocre but this time could be because I wasn't hungry at all.  We also didn't get a table the second time and had to cross our legs and sit tatami-style.  Not the most comfortable but it was okay - wish they had sweet potatoes for the side dishes, not sure why it's rated one of the best Korean restaurants in Toronto because I don't think it is, at all.  Three stars cuz service is at least fast and I'm just particularly picky when it comes to distinguishing between meh and good Korean food."}
{"text":"I got the galbi kbbq (2 servings). The portion is much larger than other Korean BBQ places I've been too and it comes with 2 rice bowls & a soup. The side dishes were also seasoned perfectly. I love that the restaurant is divided between regular seating and traditional floor seating. The floor seating is raised (like a stage floor) so you have to remove your shoes. The tables are low so you'll have to cross your legs while sitting. It makes the experience more unique! The staff are attentive although we had to remind them several times for water. Not a major issue. Sometimes I talk too much and over cook what's on the grill. So I appreciated them consistently checking up on my grilled items. They'll stir it around, move pieces to the side, or turn off the heat for me. 

I came here a second time and noticed that the floor seating is heated!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing experience at a Korean restaurant downtown, for what we hoped was a real Korean diner.  We weren't actually that disappointed.

I ordered the KalBi naeng myun, my typical hot weather dish, and my mom ordered...Something involving congealed blood, I remember that.  Hers was actually really good.  Mine...Well, the kal-bi was disappointing, but I actually enjoyed the naeng myun.  There was no slushy ice, which disappointed me, but the rest of it was fine by me.  The broth was flavorful, the noodles were tasty.

The restaurant is really small - we went during lunch hour and didn't have to wait, but there were several people behind us who did.  the service seemed okay - a little slow, but not terribly rude or anything.

The entire experience could have been better (and I have to admit, I expected more from a Korean restaurant in Koreatown), but I wasn't super disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place in winter. Love the table cooking, it doesnt really matter what kind of meat. They are all good. The portion is enough for three for sure. and the service is good. I find it reasonably priced for the amount of meat you get.
Just a note if possible don't bring your coat/jacket in. You will be leaving with a smell of korean food."}
{"text":"Strongly recommend their soups and the JapChae. Very fast service, although a little on the pricey side I think, as are many Korean joints."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Toronto and GTA. My go to dishes are pork bone soup, soon tofu, kimchi fried rice, and they also have amazing communal hot pot dishes like army base soup."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty decent, but apparently the table cooking dishes are BETTER.  However, they require at least 2 people to eat 'em - ~$25.

I didn't want to handle bones, so I ordered the spicy beef soup (yukgaejang) - $9.  It was alright, slightly watered down tasting.  The PBS probably would've been better.  Sides were alright, nothing to die for.  Purple rice that the soup came with wasn't mixed with a white grain.

Apparently this place gets pretty busy on Friday/Saturday nights 'cause it's 24hrs and there's a noraebang place next door.  Service was quick, no fuss."}
{"text":"We came across  this wonderful restaurant on a recommendation from  a friend of the owner . The friend is a member of the family who owns and operates the Honey Harbour  Towne  Center where we found some unbelievable  kimchi. 
The owners Michael and Judy were very hospitable and the food lived up to the recommendation. The pork  bone soup , ban chan, and   pork dumplings were superb. We have  lived  in the area for a long time and tried many Korean restaurants and this is one of the best."}

{"text":"WONDERFUL PLACE TO WASTE MONEY AND GET RACISM
If there was minus star for review, I would give this place -5 star as it was the worst Korean restaurant ever in Toronto due to their extremely rude service. I and my friend went there at 4.15 p.m on Fri and they pointed us to seat in a small table. We asked to move to a bigger table as we knew we would order a lot, and there was only 2 tables sitting there, one big table also had 1 Korean male customer. And you know what, they said NO you cannot move to a bigger table?? For WHAT reason, when you still had a lot of tables?? And that time was not busy at all, only 2 customers sitting.

Then, we pushed the bell to order, but no one came. I waived my hand and a lady in white T-shirt (she might be the manager, around 40-45 yrs old) saw me but didn't come. Her face looked like shit when she gave me the look of discrimination (maybe b/c we are not koreans). I called them around 5-6 times and finally they came to take order (thank GOD). And she still gave me the look of discrimination.

We ordered 2 table cooking sets of pork belly and beef sirloin, and pork bone soup. I had to say BBQ was mediocre and overpriced, only pork bone soup was good. After seeing us ordered 3 dishes, finally they told us to move to a bigger table.... (Great)

When we asked for a container to-go, the old woman in white still showed her rude attitude to us by ignoring so many times. In the end, i just gave her tip less than 10% cuz her attitude is like SHIT. Then she called me back to ask for more tips. What the fuck? You served customers with your shitty attitude and now you want more tips? That's unfair, okay? My meal was $60 for 2 people, and now you treated us like we ate and didn't pay? How dare you asked for extra tips, when you don't deserve it and be a racist server?

Not to mention during the meal, the food was UNCLEAR as it made me go to the washroom twice and spent 20mins inside while i haven't eaten anything for the whole day. There was problem with food safety and cleanliness. If you don't want to pay for the food and then stay in the WC for it and receive shitty attitude from servers, then you're welcome to try.

Honestly i really want to report this place due to food safety and I hope there will be investigators come to investigate food safety in this place. Btw, if you are not Korean, don't come to this place as you will receive a bunch of frustration and racism. 

P/S: I'm extremely shocked about the way Korean people serve customers. If you open a restaurant only to serve Koreans, then just put a sign saying that we DO NOT SERVE non-Korean. That's fine tho."}
{"text":"Been there twice and each time was mediocre.  I know people who rave about this place and I am still trying to figure out why.

Korean food generally has so many powerful flavour explosions happening in your mouth - the garlic, the green onion, regular onion, chili, sesame oil, shiso, etc., but this place for me tastes like Korean hospital food.  Truly does not do it for me."}
{"text":"First time visiting to this Korean restaurant. Wow, it is surprising with the generous amount of side dish that was given. We are a table of 5, and we did not have to refill the side dish because there are about 8 side dish and the portion was more than enough!

we ordered the blood sausage, cold sliced pork leg, and sweet and sour chicken plus a small soju bottle. The portion is generous and with THIS much side dish, everyone was bloatingly full!!!

I would say the price and the portion is definately bang for the buck. The only downside is that the food is extremely salty. The sidedish was so salty that you will need to chuck in alot of water. Heck, with the price, the amount and the variety, it's still very good.

Each person end up paying around $10 including tips and taxes. AWESOME.

(I think they have a sister store in Downtown Korean town area, this is the same restaurant but in North York)"}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so many high rated reviews. The only good thing about this place is that it's open late.
Other than that, is have to say. This place is disgusting. 

I visited this restaurant with my parents at around 12am. We decided to grab a late night snack from here. We ordered a couple of things to share, the side dishes came when the food arrived. The Bossam was over cooked and mushy. The napa that came with it was drenched in so much salt. We didn't even eat it. There was no texture to the meat and it was a tastebuds killer if you ate the Napa.  

The kbbq beef slices were okay. The soup that came with it was pretty good but there was too much veggies. The server gave us a spoon and bowls to split the soup but the bowls and spoon were dirty. It didn't seem like it was washed properly or even washed...... 

In addition to that, we found a dead bug in the side dish which totally killed our appetite. 

As for service, it was bipolar. Sometimes the lady is really nice and friendly. She would cook the BBQ for us. Other times she's really rude. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for sanitary reasons....... and bad food"}
{"text":"A good place to go for a quick single meal alone or with a small group of friends.
Always gives a lot of side dishes and nice service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Korean food. But I feel like every time I come back there is something wrong.... 

Apps: not as many dishes as Nak Wan but sometimes they would refill it if you asked nicely. 
Love: the purple rice
Food: I had a huge problem last time with one of our dishes (fried chicken w/ spicy sour sauce) . I guess this is expected. But the chicken had so much fat it was downright disturbing. I don't think we ever want to come back after this. Only cuz this is one of our favourite dishes. Also I always order the seafood tofu soup. But it seems everytime I come here there is less seafood and more tofu. Otherwise it was fine. 

Service was very quick but most of the time they seem to think just cuz we are asian that we speak Korean."}
{"text":"The food here is great especially for the pork bone soup and spicy chicken pot, the rice here is purple, the side dishes r delish,
 but the service is low and we have to wait a long time to order and they don't provide tea pot for each table ( u have to ask them to refill ur cup, which takes forever) 
They have seats that from Korea, which r uncomfortable for customers who have never tried those before"}
{"text":"I should have written this review a few months back - that was the first and only time I've been here with a couple friends, and I was excited to try it out as my friend had hyped up the place. Even though this happened months ago, I still remember the experience vividly, so I'll write about it here.

I'll start with the best thing about this place, which also happens to be the only good thing in my experience: their fried chicken. Very good and crunchy - but honestly, pretty on par with other Korean fried chicken I've had, like at Cheers Chicken & Beers, and The Fry. There's not much you can mess up when it comes to fried chicken with sauce....

My table mate ordered the munk fish dish, which I got to try a few bites. I have to say, for that price ($40), it wasn't worth it at all to me. It tasted really mealy and simply put, not fresh.

We got a table where we sat cross-legged on the floor. I wasn't used to this and found it increasing uncomfortable as the night passed; my butt was getting sore and my legs and feet were getting numb, and since it was also the middle of winter, I had barely enough room to place my jacket and sit comfortably (the customers behind me took up a lot of space and their toddler kid kept climbing about). This put a huge damper on my dining experience... I will definitely be avoiding this type of seating in the future.

Another major sticking point was that the service was really subpar; this is the main driving force behind my 1-star review here. The servers were 1) not friendly, 2) difficult to flag down, and 3) even when we did flag them down they promptly forgot what we asked for. I get that they're a busy place, but it was annoying to have my glass stay empty for the majority of the meal all because the servers weren't making eye contact with any of us. I recall clearly that it took about an hour for us to finally get our take-away boxes and bill because my body was so uncomfortable squished up in that position for an hour longer than necessary. We had to ask 3 times before anything was done for us. Maybe we should've been more aggressive and yelled out our demands instead, rather than pressing the button, politely waiting for someone to address us, finally flagging down someone the conventional way and begging to get our boxes and bill? I mean, it was pretty noisy and crowded and disorienting in that din of people and food smoke... perhaps that's the only way to really get any service? I would've thought with the crowds they'd be more watchful of customers who want to leave already so that they can open up their tables faster, yikes.

And lastly, we discovered that we couldn't have separate bills among the 3 of us. This is a more minor point, but inflexibility like this combined with the other disappointing factors listed above made me resolve not to come back here, and also discourage friends from falling for their undeserved hype."}
{"text":"One of the better Korean places in the area, everything they send out looks really appetizing.  Pork bone soup is a classic and is really good here.  They also don't make a big deal about refiling side dishes like some other Korean places in the area.  On top of that its 24 hours which makes it extra convenient."}
{"text":"Great late night 24/7 Korean restaurant to fill your Korean needs. Everyone is nice and great service. 
I usually order Pork bone soup. Or Kal big short ribs or Kimchi fried rice. Those 3 are my top choices."}
{"text":"A frequent visitor of this restaurant as it is walking distance from my home. Expect to struggle with putting in your order as many of the staff are not fluent in English, however the delicious authentic Korean food is worth the struggle. The service is also very efficient although it can get very busy on weekend nights, so sometimes there is a 10-15 minute wait. Half the restaurant has traditional-styled seating which can get hard on your knees so when that is offered I typically wait a little longer for a regular table. 

The food here is very good - my two favourites are the Korean spicy chicken called Gan Poong Gi as well as the Kalbi beef ribs. The ribs come with a bowl of purple rice while the Gan Poong Gi chicken doesn't come with any rice at all. I would recommend ordering a separate rice for the chicken as it is very saucy and sweet. The portion size of the Kalbi beef is quite small for the price, approximate 3 pieces per order while the Gan Poong Gi is huge and should be shared. 

This restaurant is very good if you're looking for traditional Korean food with a decent price point. This area has a flurry of options for Korean food however this place always seems to have customers and for good reason - the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the downtown ktown location, and i feel like this one is equally matched if not, a little better! (I felt like they had a bigger portion of the kbbq here). 

Definitely a must-try for any fans of kbbq."}
{"text":"5* for the \"basically\" open 24 hours, all of the table cooking BBQs (take a look at my pics, they're so high quality and delicious), and the spicy rice cakes. 

Also, the workers are typically nice friendly people you can chat with.Especially the guy, he's fun to talk to!"}
{"text":"This is a good Korean Reataurant. The prices are reasonable. The barbecue pork is excellent. It is not all you can but is just right for two. Side dishes taste great and you can have refills all free. The best part is this place is open 24 hrs. The staff is friendly especially when the family is working. There are many choices on the menu. This is a thumbs up"}
{"text":"In terms of food, one of the most authentic Korean restaurants that I've been to in Toronto. Lim is a last name in Korea; pronounced more like \"Im\" [eem]; so the restaurant's name may be translated into \"Chez Lim\" something like that. I like this location better than the one near Christie TTC Subway Station. 

Don't expect a top quality service, because some servers may not seem comfortable speaking in English but there is a call button as found in many Korean restaurants to call your server to your table. You will rarely have the server come by your table to ask how your food tastes or if you need anything. They will take your order, bring you food and say 'bon appetit'; then leave you alone until you're ready to pay the bill. 

-Unless requested otherwise, they will give you purple rice. 
-Their Kalbi and Bulgogi taste similar to other restaurants in the area. 
-Their buckwheat cold noodles and soy bean paste tofu soup are really good. 
-They are generous with side dishes; often give you six or more side dishes with your order.

There are two seating options: tables or sitting on a mat with your shoes off (Ondol). 

I'm not sure if parking is available; there may be some space behind the building or you can park at the nearby TTC lot or on a street.

Warning: there will be some Kpop TV show playing loudly on flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"I had the army hot pot with my friend but it's just average. I wouldn't say it's bad. Maybe this is because my expectation was kind of too high. I guess next time I would try their lamb hotspot, Korean sausage, steamed pork and others."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and authentic; they offer wide selections. Although there was only one man serving the front, he was super friendly and service was prompt.

The only complain is the hygiene of the place; I am not sure if that is one off situation. The night we visited was warm and they open the front door. There were many flies and fruit flies in the store.... I am not fond of these little creatures and find it very annoying..."}
{"text":"The delicious food was completely overshadowed by the horrible service my friend and I received. After asking if they take a card and finishing up our meals we were told they accept \"cash only\", although we were told otherwise
at the beginning. The lady behind cash was extremely rude and pointed at the sign that had nothing to do with card payments. I tried to ask if there is a sum we need to reach to pay with a card and if so, could I order something else to go but I received no answer and all of my questions were met with complete silence and pointing at the signs in Korean. The lady seemed to speak little English but the waiting stuff spoke English and were ignoring me as well. No doubt the worst service I have ever received in my life, left the restaurant embarrassed and angry. Won't be returning to this location in the future"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Lim. Went for lunch with a friend. You can't miss the place with it's orange signage right at yonge and finch. 

Pretty standard - their kimchi is actually my favourite. I was craving bibimbap today, so that's what I order. It was the cheapest one on the menu- I think veggie? I thought it would come with rice like it usually does but I guess not, and being shy me I didn't bother to ask. :c My friend says that he's seen better bibimbaps though so I'll take his word on it. I guess I'll have to come back to try their kbbq~"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants for a quick taste of home food! 
Service is just fast and efficient, nothing much to expect. 
The prices here are generally cheaper than many other restaurants, which makes this a great place to go to! I love getting their hot pots because each comes packed with a lot of ingredients and are very flavorful, great for 2-3 people to share.
I ordered the beef and octopus hot pot and was surprised with the mountain of meat. The broth taste a lot better after cooking with the beef for a while, it becomes more flavorful as it cooks!
The side dishes are good too and are refillable.
Their dishes usually comes with their purple rice as well. 
This place opens 24/7 so you can always come by if you're craving late night Korean food.

Taste is not spectacular or out of this world but definitely very authentic. Great home style food for those who want to eat real Korean food!"}
{"text":"PSA: If you are hungry get the banquet noodles!

The restaurant is clean & bright.  My friends and I came on a Sunday afternoon to gossip and it was the perfect place.

The menu is pretty extensive but sometimes doesn't have the English description so we had to go on Google.

The side dishes were fresh and tasty and complemented the main courses.

My friend got the kalbi which she didn't finish as there was \"soooo much\".  It was one of the more expensive dishes on the list for $18.50.

I got the banquet noodles.  These noodles were amazing.  The pictures I saw online depicted them as little bowls of hot comfort soup noodles.  This bowl is comparable to the size of my head. It was massive. The flavour was rich and the noodles were soft. I love carbs but I couldn't finish half of this. It's also great to eat with side dishes. For only $11.00 and filled me until dinner time. 

The service is a little brusque. But on the other hand there was only 1 waitress and the place started filling up for the lunch rush. 

I'll def be back when I'm craving comfort food."}

-below average (come drunk or have low expectations)

{"text":"Surprised that they serve water instead of tea. The free pancake at the start was great and the pork bone soup was also delicious with a huge potato and a good amount of meat. The food came out super fast and all at the same time as well."}
{"text":"FOOD: I had a Tofu seafood soup. I realized quickly that I'm not a \"tofu seafood\" type of guy. I found it tasted bland in comparison to pork bone soup or something similar. However, the sides were amazing and super tasty. I would consider going to back to try something else on the menu. Prices are low across the board. Meal + HST + tips would still be under $10.

Mind you, this strip of Yonge St is full of Korean restaurants. Every restaurant faces stiff competition, so you end up benefiting from great food and great service at most places in that area.

STAFF: Friendly and courteous. Some writers don't speak English very well, but younger ones typically have a good command of the English language."}
{"text":"Seriously bad service... Needs improvement. Not that great here, the kalbi bbq tasted literally like nothing. Rice cakes are average - not special. I feel like it's overpriced too."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite Korean restaurants in North York. I've been here on three different occasions over the past few months, and each time I tried something different with no disappointment. 

First time I came with one my best buddies and we were seated on the raised floor. Despite having grown up in Korea, it was an uncomfortable, however authentic dining experience. 

Food itself was quite good with generous amount of side dishes and refills. I have tried soups, table barbecue, and other entrées, and they all lived up to my  expectations that are nothing short of high. 

I have always been content no only with the quality of food but also the portion size. My friends and I had new years eve dinner here, and we had hard time finishing the food, and the bill was smaller than we had anticipated. 

Watch out though, as this place is usually packed. It is the worth the wait, as the line moves fairly quickly. I wouldn't hesitate to bring a friend here."}
{"text":"this post might have a slight bias. I haven't had pork bone soup, let alone korean food in a really looooooong time. so i was ecstatic for this. i of course ordered pork bone soup. along with your traditional korean side dishes, you get purple rice. and it came with A LOT of meat. unfortunately, no potato in my soup though but that's ok. I expected it to be spicier though, but it was still flavourful. very filling meal. i was pretty busted by the time i finished."}
{"text":"This place is good for what it's good for - quick, affordable, and filling food that you can access at literally every time of day (it's 24 hours). 

ATMOSPHERE:

It gets really busy on Friday nights and weekends, and the staff do their best to shuffle in as many people as they. Needless to say, it gets a bit cramped, so that same staff also do their best to shuffle people out. 

SERVICE:

For most staff here, English is their second language, so there will be a bit of a language barrier when ordering if you don't speak Korean. Even for the staff who do clearly understand English, they will shake their head and then ignore your request for additional appetizers nonetheless lol. Customer service is definitely not this place's strong suit.

FOOD:

This is the reason why most will ignore the prior two categories and come anyway - 24 hours a day access to some pretty decent Korean food. Most recently I had the \"Spicy Chicken Stew.\" Although the chicken to bone ratio could be better in my opinion, the spicy soup and vegetables/potatoes go down really nice on a cold evening. The \"Seafood Pancake\" is among the best I have had here. Usually this dish is a bit too flimsy and/or under-cooked for my taste, but the version here is quite hefty and filling, and with enough seafood, green onion, and seasoning to make it quite flavorful. 

VERDICT:

Don't expect great service. Come for the round-the-clock access to hot and filling food."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT korean food, great choices, fresh, friendly, cheap, had a fantastic meal and good service. Go where the Koreans go and you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I come to this place often the food is very traditional Korean(very tasty if you know how to order like all authentic Asian places) and portions are great for the price. Though I have to say the service is non-existent. Almost always have to ask twice to make things happen. I would say a 3.5 star would be fair to them but closer to a 3 than a 4."}
{"text":"First time here was a good experience but second was not as much. First time there, my friend and I got bimbimbap and dukbokki, which was pretty good. Service was good and we got to sit on those low tables where you cross your legs. Second time around, the person seated us but didn't give us anything to drink nor the side dishes, even after other customers came in. I got the egg fried rice, it was mediocre. Hoping to give this place another chance in hope to improve my review of this location."}

I had a sundaegook this morning and I have a bad stomachache all day with diarrhea. 
So dirty and bad service and they made me 20 mins just for card machine.

{"text":"Lim Ga Ne is up there with the best of the great Korean binge spots in this area. 

Highlights of the experience include the low tables for traditional cross-legged dining (Westerners may experience acute paresthesia) and the banchan (complementary sides).

The more adventurous eaters will want to try their specialty,  Korean Blood Sausage and even more hardcore choices like boiled liver, pig ears etc. 

The service is top-notch, even during busy hours. The food variety is great and will keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"It's 4am. You're hungry, you need a drink but it's way past last call. What do you do?

|Lim Ga Ne opens super late that attracts the after-club crowd, but they don't sacrifice quality just because they know they're one of the only ones open.

Everytime i come here , my usual is the bbq pork belly they cook infront of you. For just 30$, the feast will feed at least 3 people. 

They cook the meat infront of you, and depending on how busy they are, they will offer to cook it for you as well. You then take the pieces of fatty goodness and wrap it with a sheet of lettuce to trick your mind thinking it\s really not that unhealthy. 

It's not my first time here and definetly won't be my last. Lim Ga Ne is a solid korean restaurant that never fails to satisfy your craving for good food at 4am.

Don't let the cool seat where you kneel down amaze you. It gets tiring and uncomfortable eating with your legs crossed."}
{"text":"Looking for food after Yelp's First Open Event at Hotel Ocho landed us here at Lim Ga Ne. 

I just walked into the restaurant randomly as my Yelp friend was hungry.. and he wants MEAT... and Lim Ga Ne was the first restaurant that we walked by that was opened...... 

I wanted to sit on the elevated floor seating with my legs up, shaking like one of those Korean guys. But my friend said no way because he is so stiffed and he could never sit cross-legged.. (now now.. I have to ask him to join me for some intense yoga practise and definitely that can be fix!!). Reluctantly I got stuck with one of the boring traditional western style seating... 

Meat.. yes you can get Meat here.. and he never like cooking himself so Korean BBQ is out..and he was really happy with his: 

Sliced Beef with Marinated in Special Sauce ($13) 
- It tasted ok.. it must be since he just ate the whole thing... by himself... but he has quite a bit to drink. and hungry
- Personally, I found it lack the sizzling, bubbly, steamy hot vibe.. but what I know about hot... he is the expert as he always looking for HOT chicks! 

I want some comfy food that would offset the crazy night I have at Yelp's event so I decided on:

Spicy Beef in Broth ($9) 
- which I ordered extra spicy.. was not spicy... served in a \"WARM\" stone pot was definitely disappointing... 
- Beef was the brisket type which I found them dry.. and chewy.... 

The sides too were not too good... Plenty but not good...... maybe I should have drink more at the event? 

I probably won't be back to Lim Ga Ne, as there are so many Korean restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"The location is great and the food is even better. It's a nice place to enjoy Korean food with your significant other or a group of friends. groups are nice as you get to order and try different Korean dishes. I'm not too fond of the cross legged traditional floor seating, but it's there for tradition sake. If you're going to try this place, which I recommend, I suggest getting there early or plan on waiting."}
{"text":"I thought the food was Blend and noticed the meats were all pre packed frozen not freshly slice. I've have better."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this chain since they started up at their old location elsewhere at the K-Town, being that it was one of rare places that did home-made soondae.

Not so much anymore. In fact I was so disappointed I felt I needed to join Yelp to say something.

Dropped by with my girlfriend for a quick meal last night (Sept 3rd). Long story short, place was filthy. Tables, condiment bottles, utensil containers were all sticky, presumably due to the oily air from the BBQ. Men's washroom had dead flies left lying on the sink, women's washroom had a leaky toilet left with a big tub to collect all the overflow. The dining room had flies everywhere, and I do not know if they all flew in from the outside, or if there is some kind of an infestation.

And there was a dead fly in my soondae soup. Not sure what was up with all the flies in this place.

I get Lim Ga Ne is quite popular and is usually bustling and busy - is the staff is too busy to be looking after these neglectful conditions? Whatever the case, I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walking around in the late hours in Koreatown we struggled to find Lim Ga Ne. Until we realized, that is, that this was a new spot; a reincarnation of its former self on Euclid. And it was only after sitting down that my dining companion remembered her previous experience and it was a mess: bland food and impossible-to-deal-with service. The new Bloor street version apparently looked better, but not by much.

Like a lot of restaurants in K-town the decor is \"rustic.\" Peach coloured walls creeping with 1980s wood panelling, laminate floors and washrooms that score a six on a scale of dungeon to dynamite. There were two LCDs blaring Korean TV, and I'm somewhat grateful I couldn't understand the goings on. Weird stuff.

As we arrived, the staff was munching away at a table. They inexplicably pointed our party of two toward a table for six, but that's not a bad thing. We were promptly served the requisite water in plastic jug and given the menu: a photo-grid place mat of their various offerings: pork rib ($10), sellung tang ($8), dduk kook ($8), soondae ($8) and several meaty platters meant for two that started at $30. I had a hankering for dolsot bibimbap ($10) but it was described as vegetables, sprouts and noodles. I asked if I could get mine with meat, and my server just repeated the word. Meat. When I tried to specify pork or beef, she just said \"meat\" and nodded.  I had no idea what I was getting.

The sizzling bowl arrived, and the 'meat' was there as promised. Ground up grey stuff that neither looked nor tasted appetizing. Being spoiled by spots like BCD and SAS, I have to say it: this was a fail. The bibimbap was heavy on the sprouts and devoid of flavour. I was killing it with Sriacha, and I barely got a third through before I gave up. (This is rare; normally I force bibimbap down with the ferocity of livestock attacking feed.)

My DC's meal (beef brisket in a spicy broth) was much better received, so perhaps stone bowls aren't their speciality. For me however, this place was definitely a disappointment.

Obligatory Title Pun: This place has it's LIM-itations.

Menu Readability: I do enjoy me a photo-grid place mat.

Need to mention: A solid selection of banchan was served, but even the kimchi was a let down.

What this place teaches me about myself: If you're gonna bring the sizzle you gotta bring the steak. Or in this case, the 'meat.'"}
{"text":"Had meal several times with my friends. Tried Grilled mackerel, ox knee soup, steamed pork feet with vegetable. So far I like these thee. Side dishes were refilled whenever asked, which I really like about this Korean restaurant. I think some restaurants do not do that. One thing is that I picked up ox knee soup before but the restaurant seems they don't know anything about environmental hormone :( yeah, they just put the hot soup in the thin plastic bag and pack it.....
I would not pick up hot soup from there or bring my own box (that is safe from hot temperature) and ask them to pack the soup there. Anyways I want to try other dishes. 

I only have photo of pork bone soup and ox knee soup. Look at the side dishes :)"}
{"text":"I come here with my friends on occasion, so I have been here numerous times and I won't stop coming back.
We almost always order purely for table cooking, usually the kalbi. For about 42$ (for 2 people), they give us good portion sizes of meat, delicious sides and a piping hot tofu soup to finish off the meal. 

I bring all my guy friends here, and at the end of the meal, we can almost never finish it or we are leaving stuffed and satisfied (sometimes the waiters are kind enough to roll us out the door!)

The meat is always fresh and the kimchi is very fermented here (I prefer a fresher kimchi).
Overall, I think the food is very true to Korean food. Customer service has never been a problem as there is a button on the table to page them when you need service and they will come right away. A lot of the servers don't speak English that well however, but it's not an inconvenience to me. 

With 42$+tip money, I can guarantee that I can come here with my friend and leave here feeling full on gratifying Korean food for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went back here to try more food! When you know that a restaurant has a lot to offer, you want to go back to try more. 

The kalbi and the mackerel were both really good. Both grilled very nicely, not overly burnt but not overly undercooked. It looked really fresh when it came to our table too! So I highly recommend these two dishes too if you're not feeling for a hot pot especially during the summer months."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant at around 12am because it was one of the only restaurants open late. Decided to check it out because of all the good reviews. Especially the fact that it has an overall average rating of 4/5 by all the fellow yelpers.

First of, lets talk about services, the service here was literally hot and cold. Our server seemed really bipolar. At some points she's really rude, at other times she's really nice. It was really weird.

We ordered the Bossam and an order of the kbbq beef slices. The Bossam came with boiled pork belly?nappa? kimchi raddish i believe and sacue? We asked the lady for an additional set of sauce but she refused to give any? The Pork Belly was way overcooked? It was cooked till the point that it was really squishy?mush?there was no texture from eatting the meat? It was pretty much almost baby food? As for the nappa? I know that the dish is supposed to soak the nappa in salt but i didnt expect it to be that salty? It was so salty?it was like i was literally eating salt?In the end?ordering this dish was literally a waste of money? Barely anyone ate it.

As for the grilled beef slice? this one was okay?the beef was pretty soft? it came with some lettuce and side dishes?The side dishes literally pushed me to give this place a one star because of sanitary issues. I found a bug in my fish cake. It was hiding under my fish cake. Even though it was dead, it was still really disturbing. It pretty much made me loose my appetite.

Overall, I will not be coming back to this place because of sanitary issues and poor food quality. Not sure why there is so many good reviews but the only good thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours. 



P.S. There is no plain white rice here."}
{"text":"The gam ja tang (pork bone soup) was pretty good. I love the traditional Korean tables, which had ONDEUL (heated floors)!!!  Make sure when u sit at the traditional style table you TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES! This is pretty obvious but just in case, because they don't have any signs saying to do so. They have regular tables too so don't worry if you don't find sitting cross legged comfortable. Service was pretty good i didn't even have to ask for my banchan to be refilled! Also they don't split bills here! I would recommend at least giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Korean restaurants on the strip, this is the one I always return to. It's authentic, 24 hours, and affordable. While the service could use some work, the food is always on point.

I love that they have heated floor seating in the winter. It really elevates the experience of eating the budae jeon gol ($24.99) I always get with friends."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean restaurant on the strip. My personal favourite. Tasty broth and I crave the savoury pancakes that come on the house. My regular choice of dish is #15 (soft tofu with meat stew) or #9 (kimchi beef stew). Also, I found out this great place is open 24hrs! Never sketchy and always clean."}
{"text":"For delicious, fast service, and affordable Korean food, Lim Gah Ne is one of my favorites in the area. I ordered the Tofu Seafood soup which surprisingly was not too spicy. I especially liked their kimchi side dish as it was fresh, thick, and not sour. I have yet to try their Kam Ja Tang but will definitely try next time! The only downside to this place is that half of the place consists of low tables that require you to sit cross-legged. It's more authentic but not the most comfortable for me personally."}
{"text":"This place was packed at 1am.  We got bulgogi and octopus hot pot.  It was a bit sweet (soup) but tasty.  They give decent selection of banchan but they were not that great.  I think they don't use as much msg as bukchangdong soft tofu place across the street but able to bring out pretty decent taste (may be sugar?).  The only complaint is that all the beef was stuck together.  They probably threw in a frozen chunk of marinated beef slices that cooked together.  It is ok.  Not too many places you can find a decent korean hot pot at 1am."}
{"text":"This restaurant totally brings me back to my teaching days in Korea.  I love the sit-on-the-floor eating and the wacky Korean game shows playing on their tv screens.  

The menu is two short pages and I've been pretty happy with everything's I've tried there so far.  They have some things that are less common in some other Korean restaurants such as soondae (blood sausage) and yeomsotang (goat stew). Their kamppongi (sweet sour chicken) is also pretty good too.   They have pajeon (korean pancake) which I'm so tempted to try since it was one of my favorite dishes in Korea, but didn't based on their banchan mini-pancake.  If anybody has recs for the absolute best version of pajeon (crispy is a major factor), please let me know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
