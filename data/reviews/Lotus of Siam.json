{"text":"*3.5 stars*

Following the Yelp reviews, I tried:
1) Garlic Prawns - pretty decent! You can also eat the crispy shells. Wish it had a bit more toasted garlic. Order a side dish to go with it, otherwise, it might feel greasy. 
2) Nam Kao Tod - WAY TOO salty, too sour.
3) Egg noodles that I forgot the name of (first dish under Northern cuisine page) Apparently, this place is popular for their northern thai cuisine. So we tried dish #1, recommended by the waiter. It was just OK - overly creamy and much of the same taste. I can't tell how authentic it is since I'm not Thai.
4) Thai iced tea - too sweet

This place has so many dishes - it's difficult to choose what to order. I really want to try their sea bass, charboiled prawns, and fried whole catfish with ginger. All with beer. My advice to you will be: get what you want, not necessarily what other Yelpers have reviewed.

I will come back again. :)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation because of Yelp reviews.

Drove into the crazy/odd parking lot and didn't drive out because of Yelp reviews.

Went inside - sat down - ordered salad rolls......it just felt right. There were many regular customers who were warmly welcomed, families and out of \"towners\" it just felt good in there! You could tell there were plenty of foodies - long conversations with waiters - people asking for \"the best\" and \"you order for me, this is what I like....\"

We ordered:
Prawns on Drunken Noodles - I am rarely at a loss for words - all I could say when asked was - \"I am so happy\". 

Beef dish with peanut sauce - also wonderful - though the previously mentioned was by far my favorite. 

The service was as expected - prompt, tidy, nice but not overly solicitous. If you are looking for amazing waiters and ambiance go somewhere else. If you are looking for perfect - and I mean perfect food - please join in the feast - like many have said before - the place is so worth it."}
{"text":"Attended an academic conference down the street from here and a friend managed to get us a reservation. Some of the best Thai food I've ever had (and that's saying a lot!). Curry was just amazingly sweet, salty, and hot; veggies were fresh and crisp; the rice was perfect! Word of this place spread like wildfire through the conference, and everyone who went raved about it. Hated Vegas. Hated it. But I'd go back in a heartbeat just to eat at Lotus of Siam again!"}
{"text":"This is one of Las Vegas' hidden gems.  Unfortunately it's become well known (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars).

The deep fried whole lobster is nothing short of incredible.  Definitely my favorite Thai Food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and how come I've never seen a Thai person eat here????  The food is definitely good, but the best???  I would say it's good, but not great.   Very touristy and the prices are also a bit high.  The portions are kind of small too.  For those of you who have been to some of the GREAT Thai places in Thai Town in Hollywood, you'll be disapointed in this place!"}
{"text":"So, after seeing so many reviews/articles saying this was the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. I think it's hard to live up to the designation, because I really didn't think the place was anything special.

The customer service was awful and the food was pretty bland, given that, I think 2 stars is pretty generous."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Vegas to eat Thai food! You may want to call for reservations though as they get pretty busy. Service has always been good and the food is amazing! I love the Spicy basil w ground chicken. Haven't ben for a while but the picture came up and I had a minute to write!"}
{"text":"Garlic prawns...With shells that taste like Potato chips...what is not to like. Make reservations or get here early to assure quick service because your mouth will be watering."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday night, waited for 30 minutes for a simple dish, eggplant with chicken. The chicken was raw, so I sent it back. Then the eggplant was rubbery and inedible. I just walked out, even though I was starving! Never again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and it is always excellent.  Service can be a little slow and there is a wait for a table nearly every night, but it is worth it.  I think the Koong Sarong is the best thing I have ever eaten.  Bacon wrapped deep fried prawns.  OMG!  Soooo good!!  I have had a couple of different curries as well.  The masaman is excellent as is the standard red curry.  

This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with strip like qualities, which is to say, plenty of hype and short on substance.  I was suckered into going here after watching a recent Munchies video on top Las Vegas food joints.  As with most things in life, you're expectations of quality are based on how much you pay for something.   When you're the most expensive Thai place in town, well, you expect the best.  

We ordered tempura (bad choice being this is a Thai spot) that tasted like something you would buy out of your supermarket frozen food section.  We followed it with their \"specialty\" plate, crispy chicken with panang sauce.  For $27 you get duck that tastes like Kentucky fried chicken strips dipped in a watery curry sauce.  The other plate, I believe no. 55, was strips of rubbery beef in a acidic and vile sauce.  Terrible to say the least.  

Im hardly ever motivated to write reviews on food spots and hate being negative about things but maybe I can save a few souls from spending their hard earned money on sub par Thai food."}
{"text":"The best Thai food around period!!!  We have to go every time we're in town.  Prawns in a blanket, crab fried rice are a must.  Other than that, everything on the menu is excellent and you won't be disappointed.  Give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Rad Na Seafood and they gave me Rad Na instead because waiter did not here us correctly.  We asked nicely to exchange.  They said no.  WTF!  Never heard a resturant not willing to correct their mistake.  I also ordered Crispy duck panang and papaya salad.  Both were very good.  But waiter very rude.  No service.  Had to waive them down to get their attention.  They need to improve their service.  I guess they dont gave a f because they have lines walk out the door."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the few things I miss about living in Vegas! Seafood spaghetti is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is by far my favorite Thai Restaurant I've ever been to!!! The location is in a strange strip mall away from the strip and the atmosphere is dated but when the food is this good, WHO CARES?!?!?! 

I was there on a Thursday evening around 7pm and it was relatively busy. We did not have a reservation and had a short wait. As you are waiting you have plenty of time to read the articles on the walls expressing how good this restaurant is.  I have to agree with all the articles! The BEST Thai food in North America. 

We started off with the Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Yum Soup and they were both very flavorful and great. I've been told I have to try the stuffed chicken wings, but have yet had the chance to try them.  As for our main courses we asked for a recommendation from the wait staff. We ordered the Sea Bass cooked in the Drunken Noodle style. This was by far the best Thai dish I have ever eaten! I recommend that you order this! 

They have a great wine selection, from glasses to bottles. I had a glass of Riesling to off set the spice and it couldn't have been better! 

For dessert we ordered the mango and sticky rice. The rice was fantastically aromatic and paired great with the mango. 

I give this place 2 thumbs up and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Everyone who frequents restaurants has what I like to call a \"benchmark\" dish.  At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It's the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.

My benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I've had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.

I have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It's just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there's a magic to it.

The rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.

So five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.

And no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn't care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can't even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.

And eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.

Stay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.  It's a can't-miss."}
{"text":"Heard good reviews about Lotus of Siam so had to stop here while in Las Vegas. I was disappointed. The food was salty and there was nothing special to it. Ordered beef larb salad which was hard to finish (I dont waste food!) because it was so salty. I wanted to try something new and ordered the Kang hung lay (pork stew northern curry). It was what it was.. stewed meat in red sauce. I cant even say if it was savory or had hints of anything.. Just blah. Staff was very nice. So nice they asked if everything was ok six times in half an hour. Let me eat in peace!! I wish I ordered some basic pad thai or egg rolls - its hard to go wrong with those."}
{"text":"Great food, had the duck with noodles in curry sauce,  and soft shell crab on salad.   Dishes I don't see on the run if the mill Thai restaurants. Every dish had some chopped peanut or cashew on it, this is not a place to take my nut allergic child. 
Portions are on the smaller side, spent 125 for 5 persons for lunch."}
{"text":"Hit the lunch buffet here yesterday... for $8.99 this might be the best value in Vegas.  Options change daily but there is always a delicious curry, pad thai, veggie dishes, rice, soups, spring rolls and curry puffs.  Not to mention some killer hot sauces!  Still the best thai food on the planet, fabulous service as always."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent her 31st birthday in Vegas, and decided to not do the strip this time. Lotus of Siam was our first stop. Following Anthony Bourdain (he never does us wrong) - we found ourselves in this strip mall, that looked a little sketchy on the outside, which to us means we found the right place. There was a 30 or 45 minute wait, of which we spent at the bar. Though I was disappointed there were no cocktails, and not impressed by the shrimp roll appetizer we ordered, the actual meal made up for it. We went with what most people ordered off Yelp - the garlic shrimp and crispy duck in panang curry. So good! That deep fried shrimp skin - on point! So funny it was described as a potato chip, because it's very true! I usually eat the skin of deep fried shrimp anyway (what can I say...I'm lazy), but my wife doesn't usually. This shrimp skin goodness, she loved. I even caught her scraping the panang curry with one of those shrimp skin chips! We've visited Thailand and always complain that the food in the states doesn't compare. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and plan to go back very soon. A little on the pricy side for Thai food, but I think it was worth it!"}
{"text":"As one of the greatest Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, one should take the time to plan a night of epicurious nirvana that so happens to be located in a strip mall that reminds me of that classic Queen song: thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening MAMA MIA! But that shouldn't deter you. Yes, my friend, it is like a back street in Mogadishu at night, but during the day it's like The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Ha ha, but seriously.
I tried the pad thai, and it was deeeelish. The noodles were cooked just right, and the seasoning was spot on. The freshness of the mung beans was beyond reproach, and the flourish with the peanuts would have made Michelangelo weep. I mean, this isn't as good as any pancit, but it was good for Thai food.
Have I spoken about the duck curry? Spiced to my liking, since my constitution is vey delicate, dearest reader. And with the accompanying noodles, elevated these simple ingredients to a paragon of poultry paradise. And the best part of all is the skin, which was very crispy. Not as crispy and delicious as lechon, but that's comparing pig skin and duck skin, and there's no comparison (since pig skin is infinitely more deeeelish.)"}
{"text":"Excellent thai food in a out of the way strip mall. Its not cheap (it's also not as pricing as the restaurants on the strip) but its worth the money. The laab was killer. The drunken noodles with seabass delicious and the Singa's icy cold. Loved it!"}
{"text":"OMG Good is what I need to say about their food. I still think this place is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Crispy Duck with Panang Sauce is Da Bomb!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant so far. Both the roasted and crispy duck was delish and I don't even like duck. I love the sea bass with drunken noodles too.

I'm glad that I tried the crispy rice appetizer that's so popular but I'm not a fan. If you're into crunchy, sour and spicy bits of rice then this dish is for you. 

Will def be coming back next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Good Thai food.  I believe this place was made famous by food network which is why it's so busy.  The decor is nice for a hole in the wall.  I order the Pad Thai, Larb, and Pad See Eww.  All good dishes and made really well.  Would definitely come back if i lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"You will get very surprised when inside the restaurant. Outside and inside is like two different world. Extremely good and quick service. Food was very authentic and flavorful. I liked the garlic prawns and the sticky rice mango for dessert."}
{"text":"We came here after a long drive through Death Valley National Park on the recommendations of two different friends. We were so excited to have a meal here, and while the food was okay, we felt a little disappointed.

First, we got seated quickly on a busy Sunday evening which was good. However, once seated, it took a while to get our orders placed and to get our food. This was pretty understandable, it's Easter weekend and things get busy fast - no big complaints. We ordered the garlic shrimp and the crispy duck on drunken noodles.

While both dishes were tasty, it was a little too salty all around. The garlic shrimp felt like it had just been reheated (a few of the shrimp were a little cold and not warmed through all the way) and the drunken noodles were congealed in bunches. Overall, the food was tasty, but nothing I'd recommend going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a dive/hidden gem/hidden spot, Lotus checks these boxes. Vibe is \"hey i'm insider\" and found a cool place, unfortunately most of the secrets are gone because of social media. The Riesling centric wine list is unique and has some nice stuff. Most of the better Thai restaurants in the US are BYOB so this is something out of the ordinary. 

Some of the Northern Thai dishes are interesting and you don't see in a lot of places. If you live in Los Angeles/ Chicago/ SFO with a wide diversity of authentic Thai restaurants that you frequent, you may be disappointed with Lotus.  Its just ok. I was expecting a Pok Pok like experience, it is better than Pad Thai emporiums but not better then 20 places in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had. Be sure to make reservations other wise you will be waiting for hours. Can't go wrong with any dish, the popular choice is garlic prawns."}
{"text":"I give this a 3 because the portions are really small. Not for family eating. Food was all right. I like the thai beef salad. House special fried right is a small bowl of nothing, pad see eww has no flavor, they messed up our order, expected the second batch to be great? Nope, it sucks. Come here went you ate something beforehand, cos you will continue to starve when you leave. Not coming here again. Not worth 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"The Khoa soi braised short rib was awesome!!! Get there at 515p or make reservations early!"}
{"text":"I had tried to come here a few years back but they were closed - the hours of operation are quite short and obviously didn't pay attention to it.

My girlfriends and I took a quick trip to Vegas all I can say about this place is WOW!  The food and the service were both fantastic!  We ordered soup to start.  Based on the waiter's recommendation, I had the Tom Kha Kai with prawns which was perfectly balanced sour and hot. I like heat, a lot.  The 6 was plenty hot.  

For the main dishes, we ordered the Panang Curry, Pad Ped, and Seafood Drunken Noodles to share.  Oh.  My.  God.  Beautiful presentation, so incredibly flavorful, perfect texture, just the right amount of heat (4), absolutely delicious!  My girlfriends and I couldn't stop talking about how enjoyable the meal was.  I will definitely visit again on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious from start to end.  Drunken noodles are the bomb. Garlic noodles too.  In fact, everything was terrific. The fried banana and coconut ice cream were the perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place after we saw it featured on the Anthony Bourdain's show and I am glad we did! 
The location is totally ghetto but the food was great and very affordable! We ordered from the northern menu and liked the departure from the typical thai preparations we enjoy everywhere. This is definitely going to be our stop for every vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food with excellent service in the entire country period. No wonder there is a line of people waiting to get in starting at 5 pm every night as soon as they open! Try it you will go back every time you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Findlay Toyota salesmen bought a couple of cars from them a couple years ago everything was good. I go back to buy a new car from them I get a salesmen that is telling me that he is giving me a special deal for buying the car a cash reward for coming in its been over a month . He told me that it was in the mail I see him when I get my car serviced he walks the other direction . I call him to find out about the new car because I heard there  was a recall on something  he does not answer the.its not about the money its about good business stay away go to centennial  Toyota I here they are more loyal they will get my money in a few months when I get my next car."}

{"text":"Consistently praised by food critics and locals, Lotus of Siam is a place that has become a destination restaurant for foodies throughout the world....Congrats Chef Khun Saipin Chutima on winning the James Beard Award for best chef Southwest 2011. A mom and pop restaurant indeed, not!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought this place was great. We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. 

The waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (I ordered a bottle, and he confirmed that I knew what it was I was ordering...I did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the Riesling. I had the Panang Curry (at an 8, which was perfect) with noodles and my husband had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since.

The food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant. When I ordered the mango with sweet sticky rice (a staple at most Thai places), I was pleased when he advised against it due to the mangoes not being fully ripe.

Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Good flavors good service. Tried multiple dishes and they were all very good. Not a prime location and inside the restaurant is definitely more appealing than the outside."}
{"text":"Don't let the shady community center and run down facade fool you as there is a gem of Thai culinary delight awaiting you on the inside. Without a doubt, this restaurant is deserving of its claims of the best Thai food restaurants in the country. James Beard culinary excellence prevails throughout. Definitely a must visit on anyone's food adventures."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE THE BESTTTTTT GARLIC PRAWNS EVER! they have a good lookout so you will never run out of water and clean right away :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. Best pad thai I have ever had in my life. Flawless. Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow as always. If you choose to eat once in your Vegas trip off the strip make it this place. So non Vegas in the prices but world class on the Thai food."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic food. Loved the currys and soups. Friendly staff, moderate prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It has the best roast duck curry in town and the prices are pretty great too. It also stays true to it's thai roots, and does not include a bunch of non cuisine related dishes. The servers are really nice and the inside atmosphere is nice. Beware, the neighborhood is not amazing and the place is small, so if show up at a popular time, you'll have to wait a long time. Don't get me wrong, it's worth the wait, but they accept reservations, so just call ahead. 

Ps. I accidently posted this under a friends name before, but it's really from me. Sorry Sheri!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I ever had, though its a lot pricier than most Thai places. The location is off the strip, and its probably not the nicest area, but its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"everything was really good. the garlic prawns, 
duck, 
pad thai, 
and wonton soup are things i would recommend.

there was a long wait (about an hour), so i would suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"Off the strip, hidden in a seedy plaza, is one of the greatest hole in the wall restaurants you will ever stumble upon. Lotus of Siam is tucked away in a sketchy area, but the restaurant was just renovated and its actually nice inside (not fancy, but nicer than the standard hole in the wall asian restaurants). This place has the BEST THAI FOOD...EVER! Their specialty dish is the drunken noodle sea bass (must try this!). The catfish is amazing too! (Warning: for you non asian readers, the fish comes with head attached, but you can ask them to not serve it with the head) When you order food from there you have a choice from a scale of 1 to 10 on how spicy you want your dish to be. I'm kind of a wuss and only get level 3, but I still have to have the thai ice tea to cool my mouth down. This time, I ordered the chicken panang curry (level 3) and it was the perfect amount of spicy. Curry is so good for you, so I try to eat it when I can.

{"text":"This Thai food different than other Thai food! Always busy Eventhough the price of food expensive! The staff is friendly and helpful. I love the interior inside very classic surrounded by many wine bottles! Highly recommend for visitors !"}
{"text":"My man brought me here as a surprise. Id never heard of it. He told me he made the reservation three weeks ahead. When we arrived, the wait for non-reservations was two hours. They had our table ready immediately.  The staff were kind, attentive and prompt.  The food was absolutely to die for. This place will be a frequent stop for us."}
{"text":"Ive never written a review before but i just had to for this place! Would've been a 4 stars if their service was better!  I had really really high hope for this place due to the high ratings! The green curry was really good but the soup and appetizer were both cold as if they have been sitting at the kitchen for awhile... they took forever to bring us our food... we ordered pad thai and got pad see eww... our appetizer didnt come till the very end and we had to ask multiple times... no one came to bring us our bills... we waited and asked twice after 15 mins of waiting... we just walked up to the cashier ourselves!  Horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"OMG. this was absolutely incredible dining. A must if you are anywhere near Vegas. The food is authentic and fantastic. We had som thum, nam Kao tod, crab fried rice and crispy duck panang curry. Every dish exceeded our expectations! I would strongly advise recommendations as the wait in this restaurant can be very lengthy without."}
{"text":"Absolutley amazing!! 
Our waitress did all the ordering, I think she is part physic because she knew exactly what we wanted and hot spicy to make it, but we had no idea 
Cant wait to go back hopefully she is there becasue I would be lost without her"}
{"text":"So this place is known for having the best Thai food in the country, possibly.  Of course, with reviews like that, I tried not to expect TOO much when I first ate there, so I wouldn't be disappointed.  I mean, how could it be the best Thai food in the country?  The place is located in Commercial Center, the weirdest, sleaziest strip mall in Vegas, right by the Green Door sex club and the wig shop.  

But... the food is FABULOUS.  It might be the best Thai in Vegas.  In the country?  Who knows.  Try the Drunken Noodles- they are oh so good.  Be sure to make a reservation because you may not get in otherwise.  Service also excellent."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in America!  If you live in Vegas or are just here as a visitor, you must try Lotus.  The location might not be the best, but the food and service certainly are.  They also have one of the best riesling collections I've ever seen at very reasonable prices.  My favorite starter is the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice mixed with sour sausage, green onions, chilis, ginger, and peanuts.  It's very hard to find on other Thai menus.  I like all the soups, but Tom Kah Kai is my favorite.  All the curries are superb, as are the noodle dishes (especially the drunken noodles with soft shell crab or prawns).  If you haven't tried jack fruit, have one of the northern dishes.  The short ribs with panang is a great dish.  If you have a huge appetite and the chef makes a recommendation, try the whole lobster (I've done it once and will never forget it).  I've lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and have never tired of Lotus.  I've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here around 6 times so far.  Seen good reviews and noticed it was ranked #2 in Thai food restaurants in the country on one of the food sites, so I had to try it.  Simply put this place has the best Thai food I have ever had.  It is worth a try.  You will not be disappointed.  This is a hidden gem!

Every time I am in Vegas, I will make time to eat here.  You should make a reservation several days in advance, or you might be out of luck.  Not just a walk in place.  It is somewhat hard to find if you don't know where it is.  Some shopping strip center off of Sahara.

Their Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles is a great selection.  Try the crispy duck, this is to die for.  They will spice on a scale of 1-10.  If you like it real spicy, go to around an 8, if you still want to taste your food.  If you want all heat kick it up to a 10.  Medium is around 5-6. 

Prices are very much in line for the quality of food you get here.  Most dishes start out around $10, so come with several people and order a few dishes to share to get the best overview of their great food here.  

Service is real good.  Suggest to get an appetizer to hold you over, since you may wait for you food sometimes depending on how full they are.  Their soups are good to go with for an appetizer.
  
If you enjoy wine, they have quite the selection.  You can see a big wine closet when you come into this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant was true authentic Thai that even allows you to pick your spicyness on a scale of 1-10. I recommend everyone try the Thai iced tea it's excellent."}
{"text":"Awful service... They did not seat us at the terrace, although we arrived earlier. Instead sat some \"important guests\" that arrived after us. My kids did not enjoy the show. The wait was absurd... They don't care about the clients. We felt TERRIBLE!!!! not recommended at all!!!"}
{"text":"It's as good as the hype. It is a weird shopping center and looks tiny from the out side. But inside it is big and nice and delicious. I recommend getting a reservation though because it books up fast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

I have been here 5 times so far and neither I nor my date have ever gotten anything we didn't like. The last time we were here I got green curry and he got panang curry (not the one with crispy duck, although we have gotten that before and it was excellent). We both liked the panang curry better but the green curry was delicious as well.

Usually we also get the pork jerky or the beef jerky as an appetizer. The pork jerky is extremely juicy, the beef jerky is full of flavor, and both come with a fantastic sauce. My favorite thing on the menu is Tom Kah Kai soup, it is just the best thing on this planet. We haven't been brave enough to try the stranger things on the menu, but the menu is so extensive that it doesn't matter. If you don't know what to try, the staff are extremely helpful!

We usually order our food at a 2 or 3 which is spicy enough to make my eyes water a bit but not so spicy that I can't taste the subtler flavors. 

In another review someone complained about only getting one bowl of rice. They do only give one bowl initially--that is so everyone at the table can take some and it's not just sitting there forever getting cold. If you ask for more rice they will give you as much as you want at no extra charge and it will be out about a minute after you request more (edit: apparently they charged for extra for the other reviewer--I don't know if they forget to charge me, don't charge because we are there often, or what).

 I have also seen a few people say that the portions are small. While I personally have always left Lotus full (and sometimes even with leftovers), it is true that the portions are smaller than at your average ten-pound-plate American restaurant. The intended way to eat (at least for the curry and saucy dishes) is that you use the rice to soak up the sauce--and since the sauce is delicious and the rice is unlimited, that is how you fill up if you are still hungry.

The pricing is extremely reasonable. Usually our bill runs about 50$ total--that is INCLUDING tax, tip, appetizer, two entrees, and drinks, and it's easy to keep it under 35$ for two people if you want. I would say this is the most underpriced restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai restaurant in America. At least that I have experienced so far. Yes, it is in a busted up strip mall in a sketchy part of town, but once you step through those doors (prepare for a wait unless you get there and line up PRIOR TO OPENING TIME), you realize you have just entered a real institution where food, and pride of food, is King. 

As you make your way to the table, just take in the energy of this place as servers hurry along, pushing out cart after cart teeming with crispy golden garlic prawns and lobster. It is truly a sight to behold.  

While the curries and other standards at Lotus are wonderful, I am sure, this is a special Thai restaurant that offers so much more, so do venture outside the usuals. Definitely an emphasis on fresh seafood here... And their Northern dishes really stand out as well. 

Stand outs that we've ordered: 
Koong Sarong (prawn in blanket)
Garlic Prawns, yes, they are just fantastic as all the reviews have stated. 
Charbroiled Prawns
Suki Scallops (or Seared Scallops with garlic pepper or chilli basil)
Sliced catfish
Fried/Steamed fish and lobster dishes, while I have not yet tried them, seem wonderful as well. 

They have an incredibly impressive, noteworthy, actually, wine selection/wine room -- particularly whites -- that pair so well with their dishes. 

If you are visiting Vegas or live in Vegas and truly want to be wowed, treat yourself at this absolute gem."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai curry is panang curry - so when I heard they served fried duck panang curry I was sold. Restaurant is in a slightly run down sketchy strip mall, I started to doubt if going here was a good idea when I pulled into parking lot. Glad I kept the faith - the inside of restaurant is much nicer than the outside. Ordered duck panang, beef pad see ew, and the crispy garlic prawns. The last 2 were decent, nothing to write home about, but that duck panang... So. Damn. Good. I was just a tad sad I had to share it with my family, I wanted it all for myself."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have ever eaten...

The parking lot is a bit sketchy...watch out for bums.  

Service is pretty good.  If you plan to eat here on a weekend or when during the tech conventions, you will need to get a reservation.  

You can't go wrong with anything on the menus. 

Good selection for vegans."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought this place was great. We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. We walked around the \"Around the World\" strip mall and eventually got our call. (We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place). 

The waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling. My wife had the Panang Curry (at an 8 spicy level, which she said was perfect) with noodles and I had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as my wife and I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since, and may be in one of my top 5 meals ever.

The food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant. When I ordered the mango with sweet sticky rice (a staple at most Thai places), I was pleased when he advised against it due to the mangoes not being fully ripe.

Will definitely be eating here again. And again......and again."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good size spread:
1. Garlic prawns - Not sure what all the hype is, but not going to order again, they were just okay. Eat the shells and they'll get stuck in your teeth.
2. Combination fried rice - Good, worth buying again. This was probably the only thing that wasn't deep fried.
3. Crispy duck panang - Worth 5 stars. It stole the show. Now this baby was definitely worth buying again and again. I should have placed an order of this to go. I didn't see it on the menu, but luckily I was able to pull up another review photo. It was delicious! 
4. Drunken noodles - If I can't remember the meat in it, does that tell you anything? This is why I went in the 1st place. Noodles were stuck together, may order one more time to see if it was just the cook.
5. Chicken pad Thai - Flavor was good, but noodles were smaller than most Thai places I have visited.
6. Stuffed chicken wings - OMG!! I could have eaten 4 of these as a meal. My jaw dropped when I saw bill and realize we paid $11.95 for 2. But I think I will actually order this baby again!
7. Fried Bananas and ice cream - Actually it didn't come together, they charged us separately for it.... Come on now!! 

All in all, we spent $160 total, with 2 beers and 1 wine. Glad we went sampling, but now I know what I will and will not order next time.

Suggest making reservations, we had about 10 people ahead of us, standing in line before it opened, they have some funky hours. Lady said it would be an hour wait, but it was less than 30. mins. Glad we waited."}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I've ever experienced!  The atmosphere isn't the best, but the amazingly fresh, tasty food and good service make the place.  They are criminally busy, so unless you're willing to wait for over an hour (which I have), make a reservation.  However, they do not take same day reservations, so you need to think ahead. The Tom Kah Kai and Nam Kao Tod are religious experiences.  Every dish I've ordered, from the Drunken Noodles Seafood, to the Pad Thai to the Panang Thai Curry, has been wonderful!  I can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Take the time to enjoy this little treasure. The food was amazing. We began conversing with both tables next to us and sharing each other's dishes. The experience was one of my favorite times while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved the food especially #58- marinated sirloin strips and the garlic prawns were r favorite. The staff was also very friendly and helpful in our selections. All our young children enjoyed as well: BBQ chicken and fried rice!"}
{"text":"5 stars here for the Crispy Garlic Shrimp & for making my cousin/family believers in their first Thai food experience. I've never had shell on shrimp like this & would recommend it to anyone. Also, the Khao Soi with Duck was as good as Anthony Bourdain's reaction to it lead me to believe. Staff was very quick & friendly, which was saying something for how busy they were on a Monday night. When in Vegas, get off the strip & check this spot out"}
{"text":"Warning.  First, this place is the best thaiI have ever had.   Lived in se asia including thailand.   But tonight I ordered 3 dishes for pick up.   I opened them at home and thought this was a joke.    Not enough food for one, and I planned on feeding three.   Just thought I would let everyone know.  Still love this place but will dine in."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, do not go to Vegas without visiting. The Nam Kao Tod- fried rice- is unbelievable. Maybe the best food item I've ever had. The spicy Northern Thai mushroom dip will burn you for days to come in places that you don't normally mention on Yelp, but it is awesome. Strip mall Thai Restaurant heaven. Do not miss this place."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every meal I've had here over many trips to LAS. I had the sea bass with papaya salad on this last visit, which was truly one of the best Thai dishes I've had in a long time. Wine and beer list great and well-selected for Thai food. My dining companions were also blown away by the taste of their food. Yes, it is in a terrible location, but over years I've never had a problem in the parking lot. The interior ambiance is well-lit, classy and cheerful. The service is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. It took the waiter 20 minutes to come to the table the first time, he never asked if we wanted drink or water refills, and we waited 20 minutes to get the check. C'mon guys, that's the easy stuff; I can understand and forgive the food taking a while to come out on a busy night, indeed please take your time to make it right, but to be forgotten on drinks and the check? grump, grump, grump..."}
{"text":"Always have to stop by this place when I go to Vegas.
Their curry is not as good as other places, but other food is delicious. 
Khao soi is my favorite here. 
Service is wonderful. 
Very busy in the weekend."}
{"text":"James, the technician, came in response to what we believed was a cracked shower pan in a second floor shower. Another plumber had looked at it and said he could fix the problem for \"only 800.00.\" James, after examining it, stated that it was not a crack, but a surface mark near the drain, and therefore was fine to use. After we looked closer, he was right, and we really appreciated his honesty. If we have another problem, we will have the number and name on file."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  Amazing wine list.  Do not let the strip mall scare you.  Food is awesome."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after numerous trips to Vegas.  This is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant if not THE favorite restaurant in Vegas.  It will definitely be my go to place to eat whenever I am in Sin City.  That is quite a recommendation, considering I am part Thai, my father was a Thai chef, and I travel all over Thailand frequently eating my way through the country :-)

It is crazy what you find in a nondescript strip mall off the Strip.  Other diners seemed to be enjoying the lunch buffet...when in Vegas, right?  We did look at the food offered on the buffet and it looked good, but after seeing some of the regional dishes that are not commonly available at most Thai restaurants, we had to bypass that.  

The tod mun pla (fish cakes, sometimes on the menu at Thai restaurants, but more often no) was very good.  The Khao Soi is not offered at very many places.  I can probably count on my hand how many of the thousands of Thai places I have eaten at had this on their menus.  It was phenomenal!  It was authentic to any of khao soi I have had in Chiang Mai and other parts of Thailand.  It was even served with the same garnishes.  The dish was bursting with flavors.  I was in heaven and would have gone back again for dinner that night if I didn't have other obligations.  My friend had the yellow curry and that was very good as well.  

The servers were attentive and good about refilling our water and checking to see that we were doing okay.  I complimented the chef and raved about the khao soi being as good as any I have had in Chiang Mai and was informed that the chef was from Chiang Mai, so it was great.  They looked like they had a solid wine list as well.  The other great part of the dining experience was the price.  It was $30 for two people with an appetizer, two entrees, and one Thai iced tea.  After dropping $20 for breakfast for one while stuck in the hotel, this was a wonderful deal :-)"}
{"text":"Best thai food in vegas, hands down. Maybe some of the best thai food I've ever had, and I've been to Thailand!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place a few times since I moved here. If you enjoy good Thai food, go here and I promise you, your not going to be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I came to this place after hearing great things and reading about how many world class chefs have ate there. Finally after visiting, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the food. The service was impeccable, and having worked in a higher end restaurant for several years, I could not find a single flaw. The food doesn't feel like it lives up to the standard of the service. I came a large group of people and we ordered the nine most popular dishes. And I must say that nothing about any of the food stood out.  I couldn't find a flaw with the taste or texture, but nothing about the food captured me. It was a bit of a let down, the food was still good, but everyone I was with felt the same way. Overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. If the food matched the service, it would be the best restaurant in the world."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to order is the Khao Soi, described as a typical Burmese influenced dish is served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream. Delicious! For dessert, the fried bananas and coconut ice cream are an absolute must!"}
{"text":"it's true: you need to make reservations or be ready to wait a looooong time. try making them a week in advance if possible.

as far as the food is concerned, we stuck mostly with the northern thai menu since that's the stuff you can't get elsewhere. if you just want some pad thai go elsewhere, this place will be wasted on you.

the garlic prawns were beyond awesome, though if i go again i'll probably try something else. there are so many options! the crispy duck with chili and basil leaves was amazing. it would be hard not to get that again. i've never had anything like the pounded and shredded jackfruit but it was so good i'd order that again in a heartbeat. we got some fried rice for the kids. it was pretty good and is a nice option if you have someone less adventurous in your group. but again, you don't go to lotus of siam for fried rice. 

next time i'm in vegas i'll definitely be back, and maybe more than once."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the location-- Lotus of Siam is worth the hype. I opted to go for the pad thai and see how a James Beard award winner adapts a tried & true classic. My oh my am I glad I made that decision. Lotus of Siam is not only delicious, but reasonably priced! 

Be sure to call early (and often-- the phone was busy for hours) to get a reservation, as this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Acceptable service and our server has great memory or because we only order a few things. 

The owner of this place must be very rich. They have a huge wine section and bar at the door. 

Pork skewer - surprisingly juicy and we'll marinated 
Northern style chicken soup - usually with coconut milk but this is without and taste is very different but super tasty to start off
Drunken noodle soft shell crab - very special combination, good too.
Fried duck panang- amazing. Probanly I never tried fried duck before plus the sauce is very addicting. 
Norther style ground pork-sounds simple and looks unpleasant but the taste is very unique 
Chicken green curry - don't other to order, the chicken is a bit dry.
Of course ending with mango stickyrice. Good too

Deserve a 5 star because of the variety of choices plus unique dishes offered."}
{"text":"After having a disappointing lunch we had to leave Vegas on a high note and this place delivered.  We walked in on Sat without a reservation, they were all booked but were able to squeeze me and my wife in.

We were not that hunger so just shared the seafood drunken noodles and an order of garlic shrimp.  Both dishes were great and cannot wait to come back and try other dishes. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Most phenomenal wine list in Vegas complements exceptionally good Thai cuisine.  Worth the cab ride and whatever wait you must endure."}
{"text":"I decided to write a review for this place but the only problem was that I have not eaten here in years. So I decided to order take out last night. I ordered the drunken noodles with duck. 

Pros: it was as delicious as ever. The noodles tasted great. They give you the sauce to put over separately, so be careful not to drench it. The duck was great as well. The duck was fried and deboned for easy eating. 

Cons: they didn't give me a pair of chopsticks.

This is the benchmark for all thai food."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had.  Ended up going twice on my last trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Thai food of your life unassumingly located in an off-Strip sketchy strip mall, with the accolades and photos with celebrities adorning the walls and full tables to prove it.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu; however the pad thai, crispy duck, and braised short rib with panang were standouts."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food restaurant we have ever been to and we have a seen a ton of them in our day. This was our second time and it's just fantastic. Wonderful menu with an unreal wine list. We rarely go to someplace twice in Las Vegas, but we will be back again and again. Gold star for best restaurant in the worst location you can think of. We now downlaod their menu and go over it to select our dishes at home so we know what to order when we get there. Don't forget to call ahead to make a reservation for dinner as the lines can be really long to get in on Friday and Saturday nights without one."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Might be the only one I've ever given a 5 star review to. The fact that it was a full house on a Tuesday ought to give you an idea of how good the food is. Yelpers didn't let me down with the Garlic Prawn and Crispy Duck Panang recommendations. Will definitely return next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Thai food I have ever had!.....and I've had a lot! My husband saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain and luckily took mote of some of the dishes featured so we were able to try those and they were amazing!!! Definitely order of the Northern Cuisine in the back of the menu....the red chili dip, pork stew, and the braised beef egg noodle curry dish...,also on apps menu the fried rice with the pork sausage was to die for!!! Also, they have a fantastic wine menu. Definitely worth the trip off the strip. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, but not amazing thai food.  Still, I would recommend this to people who are looking to get away from the chains, buffets, and mostly americanized food on the strip.  It's nearby and pretty good.  It seems more authentic than most other places and has a wide variety of Thai dishes.  

Nam Kao Tod: slightly sour, which is a little weird at first, but overall I really liked this dish.  Yumm crispy rice.  

musaman curry - To be honest the curry was a little thin and the flavor wasn't as deep and rich with spice as this place in Houston I love.  Ever since I ate the \"masamun curry\" there, that's the benchmark I place other curries at.  Lotus' curry was just so so.  However, the beef was great!  Super tender.  

Drunken noodles - Really tasty.  I would recommend this dish.  we got it with seafood, but there's a whole bunch of other variations you can get the noodles with.  

I think the last thing we got was the red curry, but I'm not sure - I liked it better than the musaman curry, richer flavoring.  Decent choice.  

Service: really good for an Asian restaurant in a sketchy looking stripmall.  The restaurant's a bit fancier than most asian places you go to, and the waitstaff is very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped prawn wontons are unbelievable. The prawns stay tender while the bacon gets crispy. Sauce is perfect as well.

Seabass with drunken noodles is delicious and useful after drinking.

You'll spend a bit waiting if you don't have a reservation but the bar helps the time go by with a legit wine selection."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, and tiny....I mean tiny tiny portions. The deep fried prawns with the shells were great. Everything else was just ok. Pad thai wasn't your typical ketchupy tasting fast food pad thai but the portions were so small it was a joke. Same with the papaya salad and most of the people eating there were white. Think about that for a second. I'm not saying white folk don't know their Asian food but an Asian restaurant with no Asians eating there tells you something. Food was slow to come out but service was good. They kept coming back and checking on the table. Maybe one too many times in fact but I guess it's better than bad/no service. If you are looking to try the place because it was on tv by all means. Not a whole lot of value for your buck though. You can basically get just as good or better somewhere else. The difference if there is any is marginal at best."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight with the bf and a friend.  I think the place was good, but maybe over rated.  I would suggest to call for reservations if you plan to have dinner there; there was a huge crowd waiting at 8:30 (the place closes at 9:30!).  The place was still packed at 9:30.  

Service was good even though it was very busy.  

Since I saw so many 5star ratings, I was expecting the food to be better than my usual Thai places.  I have tried millions of Thai places in San Francisco (my hometown) and I like the food better at the usual Thai spots.  

Food:
Pork satay - fav dish of the night.  not overcooked and very flavorful.
Northern larb - this dish was ok.  The larb I usually order has more flavor.  This might be because it was \"Northern\" larb, but I still like the usual larb I order.
Roasted duck curry - this dish was good, but not the best I've had.  I would say this is my favorite Thai dish and there are about 3 other Thai places that make this dish better."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped prawns. That appetizer was a hard act to follow. But each dish was delightful in its own way. Highly recommend the papaya salad, and Tom Kah and Tom Yum soups.  As for the entrees I should have been more adventurous and gotten the whole fish or a duck dish but I played it safe and had the more than adequate red curry and drunken noodles.  Glad I have something to look forward to next time!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday 1/4/13  @ 6PM because of the reviews and before a show at the Wynn. Almost missed the location from the Sahara and thought it was a mom and pop, 10 table HITW. Walked in on a tiny waiting area for a surprisingly large restaurant. Hostess said it would be a 2 hour wait (for 2), OUCH! Packed with diners and food coming through looked good so helped ourselves to the bar area where we could see many enjoying themselves. Really bustling and waiters earning their tips. Ordered a SINGHA pint and enjoyed conversation and reviewing menu with my lady. Met a great couple from Houston who also came bc of Yelp and made the wait short. Actually, wait was only about  45 minutes and they were ready to take our order + another round. Ordered pork satay, seafood pad thai, spicy catfish and fried bananas.All delivered to our table diligently and well presented. Was all very tasty but will definitely order off the beaten path next time around. when in Vegas."}
{"text":"There's this HUGE parking lot outside.  SCORE!  

This is seriously the best Thai Food in North America.  I was a skeptic reading all of these reviews at first, but eating there reminded me of the time I lived in BKK.  Its Americanized up to a point, but meh.... food and price is awesome."}
{"text":"Food is okay but so over rated, thai restaurant in same shopping center should try. 
I probably will not come back, service is ok"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is the bomb!  Ok... Let me qualify that statement...  The food at Lotus of Siam is the bomb...  The Tom Ka Kai soup was the best I've ever had.  The chicken dumplings were excellent.  The steamed sea bass was succulently fantastic.  The pineapple fried rice was average and the pepper garlic pork was good, but a tad salty for my taste.  Overall, the sum of all the flavor was excellent.  The wine list was huge...  Especially for a hole in the wall place like this...  The only thing the group thought was disappointing was thst the place was kinda dumpy...  Some will argue that's part of the charm, but upon entering, it just didn't feel very clean.  I can live with that and I'd definitely go back.  Great thai food experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food.  Nestled between a few other ethnic restaurants and a swingers club lies Lotus of Siam. Interesting location. Have I had better?  Yes, but that doesn't mean this place isn't worth going out of your way for. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp,  pad see ew, and mint basil beef.  All three were delicious but i could've used more heat.  I over heard other tables being given a spice level choice of 1 to 10, but that option wasn't offered to us. Other than that everything was perfect.  Great food, great service. If you go make a reservation this place has a line before the doors open.  I look forward to my next trip to Lotus."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas.  Hands down.  Crappy location, but great food and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Our lunch group of 16 visited 1 PM March 2011 w/1-2 days advance warning so tables would be ready. Those deciding on the buffet were sorely disappointed as pans were pretty empty, even Pad Thai noodles not refilled despite complaint to waiter and then mngr and there was little solid food in the pans which looked like mostly soup or sauce. I ordered a prepared to order beef dish. Tasty but only about 3 oz of beef for $16 and insuffient amt of food unless you love small Lean Cruisine size portions. Don't know what it is but the decor.. total LACK OF..in these places puts me off. May give it another try but I liked or 4-7-2011 visit to Namaste much better and it is only a couple doors down. This is an older seedy area at N end of Strip in Commercial Center. After overkill glitz-glamour on strip it may be the place suffers big time by comparison but I would say not updated since it opened. Also despite advance requests our waiter had a tough time giving us separate cks and the kitchen seemed unprepared to put out 10-18 individual orders. Will give it another chance but with so many really good restaurants it will be 2012."}
{"text":"I double checked to make sure we went to the right restaurant. I would rate the food as edible but not good. Very disappointing after reading all of the reviews. Wasted money on the cab ride in addition to the bill."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Thai food I've had - and Thai is one of my favorite cuisines. In all the dishes we ordered, fresh herbs and well-balanced sauces made the varied flavors pop. Our favorites included the papaya salad, the beef and eggplant salad, and fried catfish. The best part - the prices are reasonable, especially given the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam definitely lives up to it's reputation. I love Thai food and I've been to several Thai restaurants around the country and this is easily the best Thai food I've ever had. Not only is the food here amazing but the prices are very reasonable. 

My dad and I both had an amazing meal here. We ordered the Nam Ko Tod to start and it was a great start to the meal. It was a great play on sour, salty, spicy, and crunchy texture. Next I ordered the Khao Soi and my dad ordered the Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles. Both were phenomenal dishes. We also shared a side of the spicy pork fried rice, which couldn't have been any better. And last but not least we shared the sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream. This is a must have and was one of the best deserts I've had in a while. It was the perfect way to end the meal, it's very refreshing and not too heavy and not too sweet, a great way to cool down your mouth after a spicy meal."}
{"text":"Like so many others I just cannot say enough great things about this place.  We went on a tuesday at 6:30 with no reservation and waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Not bad while waiting at the bar.  The staff is extremely friendly and while they bring the food quickly it's never rushed and they welcome you to take as long as you need to peruse the extensive menu.  For appetizer I got the Tom Ka Kai soup - a  bit wary i was making such a pedestrian choice but it's truly one of my favorites.  All I can say is I will remember this first bite forever!  What amazing flavors - so bright and delicious!  The perfect amount of coconut milk - not too much to make it thick just enough to give flavor, juicy sliced chicken, what has to be a whole squeezed lime in my cup, lemongrass and cilantro topped off by a spicy chili.  I ordered a 5 in heat and hot it was.  Delicious!!!  The satay was also very good with a proper  spiced peanut sauce not sticky.  For dinner it was drunken crispy shrimp from the Northern part of the menu.  Again just outstanding.  The shrimp were huge and plentiful and my husband went with the cashew chicken.  Another simple choice but amazing flavors.  I cannot wait to return to Las Vegas simply to go here.  I likely will make this a regular place once if not twice every trip."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!

Favorites are Pad Thai, Tom Kah Kai soup and the Crispy Duck that is to die for. The Prawns are also delicious.

Very impressive wine menu and great service.

Be sure to make a reservation on weekends!!"}
{"text":"Their crab fried rice is reallllly good. I ordered it spicy. Their papaya salad is also worth it!"}
{"text":"En cherchant sur Yelp... J'ai trouvé ce restaurant qui était bien noté.
Nous sommes arrivés à 9 personnes sans réserver, effectivement il faut savoir que c'est un restaurant, à l'extérieur... On se demande où  on est tombé!! 
La carte.... On s'est vite perdu, ne parlant pas anglais couramment cela été un peu compliqué, on a finalement dit au serveur qu'il nous mette les meilleurs plats de la carte on lui faisait confiance... Eh bien c'était un REGAL, franchement très goûteux beaucoup de saveur j'ai adoré 
Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés!"}
{"text":"Lotus is one of my all time favorites in Las Vegas.  Always packed and only recently expanded their dining room.  I'm glad they didn't also update the drab, dated, poorly-lit, yet chandeliered carpeteria but in an awesome way space.  

Part of the fun is braving the gnarly and forgotten Commerical Center (as far from City Center as you can get).  The giant lot is riddled with weeds and broken glass and homeless and surrounded by blue-collar gay bars, fetish shops, the Green Door, and other strange and secluded shops.

Inside you'll find friendly service and a hodgepodge of Vegas' real movers and shakers.  If you want tool-academy rejects and busboy-pimps, head to the Palms and Tryst and Tao.  The Vegas pols and artists and hipsters and foodies head to Lotus to Thai one on without breaking the bank.

I love the usual Thai-noodle standards (great pad woon-sen and pad thai) and curries, but the spice seekers head for the Northern menu, the Chef's home turf and specialty.

Great list of German whites to stand up to the spice as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the negative comments are all about, but this was hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. I was in Vegas for a couple days and had to have a meal due to at least 5 recommendations from friends.

The food was flavorful, crunchy and tender when needed, and portions not overly huge like most places. My friend and I shared the Mikrob and garlic prawns, and I had the crispy duck with drunken noodle. All were absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"A 3.5stars! We followed Yelp's review and stopped by around 3pm to have late lunch. you could tell it's a popular place by the crowd of people there even it was late afternoon. We had Papaya Salad and Garlic Prawn following the recommendations from their staff. The prawn were so crispy and fresh, you will love to lick the plate up!!! as I did...LOL. We ordered our papaya salad at  medium spicy but it was too much for us and they just replaced our plate with a new one(no spicy at all one). That was so sweet!! The only thing we would like them to improve might be their price. I have eaten in Pasadena's Saladang and Saladang served nice food with great atmosphere and reasonable price. Lotus doesn't have nice interior decoration but charged more than Saladang. It would be the only reason keeping me from visiting this place again.  Otherwise everything works so well here. If you have family or a big party who don't care the atmosphere that much, this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"As good as advertised. Started with the egg rolls, and they were on point. Next we had the spicy vegetable soup. Got 6/10 spicy, but tasted 9/10 due to the amount of chili oil. Still, good flavor with lots of fresh veggies. For entrees, had both the fried tofu and crispy duck panang curries. The duck was exceptionally tasty. A must have. We also had the Thai tea (coconut milk based) and was also exceptional. Not too sweet and it balanced the spice in the curries. Atmosphere was comfortable, good prices, very hospitable service, and quick and efficient service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"4 of 5 stars...for now.  would i go back? definitely!

lotus of siam is located south of the strip in a sketchy looking plaza.  dont let the exterior fool you because the food inside is pretty fantastic.  i think they have the hugest selection of thai food ive ever seen (like pages and pages of items on the menu).  i have to say that the pad thai is the best ive had...in my life. really!  the drunken noodles were good too.  the best? no.  but good...possibly 2nd best.  the coconut soup was yummy but definitely over priced.  lastly, we had an appetizer made of minced pork (cant remember the name, sorry) served with fresh veggies and pork rinds.  it was good but not a \"must.\" 

another tip: they have lunch buffet during the week.  they are not open for lunch during the weekend.  also, get there early for dinner or expect a huge line."}
{"text":"We went all the way taking mono rail from mgm to this so called excellent place. When we reached there, the waitress was busy and hardly had time to help us through menu. Finally drunken noodles and cashew nuts arrived after 30 mins. It was most horrible
 thai food i ever had. Drunken noodles had a strange smell to it. Looked like just boil it and added all vegetables without frying it. I would nver go here again"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! This place didn't disappoint! We ate everything below. 
Drive here. Eat this. Be happy. 
Khoa soi, nua Dad deaw ,#109 beef noodle & crispy chicken dumplings 
I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went to Lotus of Siam based on a friends recommendation. This was before I even knew that Anthony Bourdain went there in his latest parts unknown episode.  If I would have watch the episode prior to going I totally would have ordered off that northern Thai menu. Instead I'm with my usual of Tom Yum soup and panang.  

I was dumb enough to order it spice level of eight out of 10. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food, the level of spice made it almost unbearable. One of my friends ordered it at a level of two and said it was the most enjoyable Thai experience he ever had, partially because I was so miserable.

The service was great, the location was a bit scary at a random stripmall off the main strip, but don't let that deter you from trying this place out.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I come here every time I am in Vegas.  Dinner time is always busy so patience is required.  My favorites are spicy papaya salad, drunken noodles with soft shell crabs,  and fried rice."}
{"text":"Way over advertised, had a much better Thai food. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I love green curry, deep fried prawn and northern sausage.  Never walk out disappointment.   The service is always good.  They are very nice and professional.  The price is affordable.  The only thing I dislike is you have to get there at least 5 minutes before they open.  Otherwise, can't avoid a wait."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little out of the way but I'm glad that we found it.  
The most important thing to know is that you should call ahead for a reservation!  The dining room is very large and seats many tables but there are so many people that come here that the wait for dinner was really long.  
The second thing to know is that their wine list has hundreds of wines by the bottle  Hopefully you're not indecisive!
Another interesting things was that the bathroom was in a prime spot of the wait staff to carry food and only had 1 stall even though the restaurant is one of the largest ones I have ever been to.  
The waiters did a pretty good job of attending to the tables even though there were so many people.
There were plenty of options and we liked everything that we tried.  i would definitely come here again but only if I call ahead!"}
{"text":"We went back to Lotus of Siam for the 2nd time.  This place is in a crappy strip mall in the middle of an industrial waste land off of East Sahara Blvd.  TOTALLY WORTH IT.  This time, there were only two of us and the problem with that is that we can only order so much.  Better to go with a lot of people and get to taste lots of different things.  (4 stars and 476 reviews!) In the past, we've ordered a whole sea bass, mee krob, larb, green curry, glass noodle salad -- everything was GREAT.  Not like your local \"pretty good\" Thai establishment, this place serves authentic Thai food.  Not made for gringos.  It's HOT.  So order beer."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Highly recommend the drunken noodles and the garlic shrimp was superb! The wait time is around 30 minutes for party of four but we got lucky and got in 10 minutes. 
The seafood noodle soup was okay.  I would not get it again. 
Pang curry was alright but I would try the northern curries next time."}
{"text":"Off the strip but worth the short trip. 
Best Thai food in Vegas bar none.

Looks like hole in the wall from the mostly empty parking lot but once you're inside its great. Recomend reservations for sure."}
{"text":"Hannah, you are absolutely amazing!  You always pay such attention to detail.  I am ALWAYS getting compliments on my nails (which is why I always have your business cards with me).  Your place is inviting, exciting and classy, just as you are.

{"text":"Best and most authentic Thai restaurant in Vegas. And possibly in the U.S. If you are looking for the hidden gem in Vegas, this is it. Expect to wait for table, but that only means you are at the right place. If you eat at one place while you are here, this is it. And it's not some overpriced over hyped joint on the strip. Its the best Thai in the country buried in a dumpy strip mall, not far from the strip. Food. All curries are fantastic.  Tom kha kai is perfect, try the version without the coconut milk. I want that recipe!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and truly authentic. It's so inconspicuous but once you find the location, you'll know it's the right place because it's bustling and packed in there. It can be a 2 hour wait if you don't have reservations. 

Our waiter was great and recommended a few of his favourites to us. All great choices.
We had this appetizer ( don't remember the name) that was made with crispy rice, flavoured with sweet, sour, and spicy sauce. It was divine. 

My favourite was the seafood drunken noodles. They are a must!

We told my mother in law about this place when she travelled to Vegas, and she went 3 days in a row."}
{"text":"Ohh Lotus how I love thee. Eating here is always number one on our list of restaurants when coming on our yearly Vegas trip. Yes it's in a gritty neighborhood but I applaud the restaurants efforts in keeping it real and being accessible to all types of patrons. 
     Reservations are a must so we stopped by during lunch hours on Wednesday to secure a reservation for our party of 8 for the following night. We were warned about the 5 minute rule, which is essentially if all in your party are not there within 5 minutes of reservation, your table is forfeited. 
     We arrived Thursday, we're seated promptly and after some time put in drink orders. The selection of rieslings by the bottle is extensive and a bit overwhelming. Placed our order to include the following dishes:
* Rad Na with shrimp @ $11.95. - 4.5 stars, yum gravy. 
* Braised short rib with panang @ $22.95. - 4.5 stars, tender with spot on curry.
* Chow mein with chicken. @ $ 8.95. We had 9 year olds to feed, need I say more? 3 stars, but who comes here for chow mein?
* Chicken Rama @ $21.95. - 1 star. Biggest disappointment of the night.  Got this for 2 kiddos to share and it was rather sad especially for the price. The plate consisted of about 5-6 half doll
ar sized pieces of flattened white chicken on a handful of steamed snow peas and about three asparagus. Everyone was shocked when I mentioned the price. 
* Salmon Nam Tok - @ $22.95.  2 stars. Ordered level 10, not spicy and an overly lemongrass flavor. Didn't taste well seasoned but cooked perfectly.
* Prim Nook - @ $11.95. 1.5 stars. Excited to try this, totally disappointed. This was bland, even at spice level 7 and just tasted like  can of mashed hatch chilis. 
* Pepper garlic sauce with shrimp - @ $13.95. 4.5 stars. Best dish of the night for me, I will be dreaming about that sauce until I get back to vegas. 
* Spicy catfish with basil leaves - @ $14.95. 4 stars. Catfish have a wonderful crunch and a great spicy sauce.
* Moo Yang @ 14.95. 3.5 stars. This was a nice dish and definitely a better choice for the kids than the chicken rama. The pork was tender and nicely cooked. The spicy sauce on the side, delicious. 
* Mango with sticky rice @ $8.95. 3.75 stars. Rice was warm, delicious, mango was sweet but a little bit brown around the edges. A bit expensive.
     We love trying new dishes every time we come and some are hits, some misses. Lotus excels in their sauces and curries especially and has a menu of items you can't find most places.  The portions are pretty modest. I don't have that big of an appetite and could easily eat 2 dishes myself. Also, the pricing is a bit wonky to me, some items are well priced others not so.  Relative to most good Las Vegas restaurants, the expensive items are really not that expensive though. Lotus' reputation is earned with good reason."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Thai food in Vegas-- not that I know many other places to go.  

Divey and off the strip, it is worth the taxi ride-- but be sure to have someone call a cab for a pick up (which can take a while), and stand outside to pick up your cab, because someone else might steal it!

Of all the 4 and 5 star places my colleagues and I could have eaten at on our expense account, we chose this place, because of all the rave reviews.  We were not disappointed!  From the soup to the apps to the wine, everything was delectable and....SPICY (despite sticking to mild, medium to appease everyone's palates)! 

The menu is extensive, so it could take a while getting through all the pages.  Be adventurous and order something you normally wouldn't, or let the server make a recommendation.  Everything we had was good!

This restaurant has received Wine Spectator Award of Excellence awards as well as a couple of James Beard awards.  

Don't take my,  the Spectator's or JB's word for it.  Check it out yourself.  I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Garlic prawns 5 stars
Sliced garlic beef 5 stars
Tum yum noodle soup 4 stars
Chili mussels 3 stars

Been to Vegas many times and this is my first time here. Will definitely be returning on future trips. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I think the biggest mistake I made coming here was that I was expecting to be blown away. Afterall, some people say this is \"America's best Thai restaurant.\" That being said, the food was really authentic, the shrimp were fresh and huge, and the service was warm!

1. Thai Iced Coffee - Oh My Heaven, I would've chugged this all day if I could have!

2. Garlic Prawns - yum! I'm don't always love fried shrimp, but these are perfectly golden fried (not greasy), are tender, and have a subtle seasoning

3. Chu Chee Shrimp - Oh my goodness NOM! This was similar to a Red Curry but was super fresh and light tasting. 

4. Kao Soi - I'm not in to soupy noodles, but my friend ordered this. His mom was raised in Thailand and he has had the dish at home and in Thailand many times. He thoroughly enjoyed it!

5. Thai Iced Tea - this was fine, though I would've preferred a stronger tea flavor (it was a little bland due to too much milk)

6. Mango Sticky Rice - I suppose it's hard for this dish to ever really blow anyone away. It was good, and the seasoning on the sticky rice was a nice contrast to the sweet mango

Tip: make a reservation for dinner to avoid a 2+ hour wait. You should be fine for lunch though (we have no wait at 1:45pm on a Friday)."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today.  The food was so amazing!  The fried rice and sour pork appetizer was a bit spicy for my wife, but I found it delectable.  We also had the crispy duck with drunken noodles, the title speaks for itself!  Service was great, and it was not busy as we hit at the end of the lunch rush.  I'll be sure to go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Some of the best, most authentic Thai food I've ever eaten. Be careful with the spice scale! It goes from 1 to 10, with 3 roughly Tobasco, and 7 \"Thai spicy.\""}
{"text":"We went to Vegas for NYE, and the first stop for food is Lotus of Siam, our faviorite THAI restatruant in Vegas. Food is as amazing as usual. We ordered the duck, softshell crabs, yellow curry and crab rice, and enjoyed every single one of them. 

But besides food, I also want to say that I really appreciate the service that night. It was a full house as always, but everybody, especially the manager May, was very nice and helpful, which gave us an even better dining expereience, and that became the awesome start of our NYE celebration in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been here a few times now and every time I come here I'm very happy.  I usually dine here with clients and they love it.  The wine selection is epic for a Thai Restaurant.  Today we had Chilean Sea Bass, papaya salad, and Tom yum soup.  Food was solid.  I'm giving a 4 out of 5 stars as I feel that the food is not as epic as other Thai restaurants.  I'm able to say that as I've tried a great deal of Thai restaurants from coast to coast.  It's still a must try for off strip food in Vegas in my book."}
{"text":"meh, not worth a two hour wait.  make reservations instead.  service was good.  Can't compare with Thai restaurants in LA due to big difference in price."}
{"text":"First tip - bring lots of people!! There are many dishes that you're going to want to try and it's best to achieve this 'family style.' Food, the way it's meant to be enjoyed - with others.

I'm still struggling with an internal debate of whether the place is overrated or if it is because we didn't get to try EVERYTHING on the menu... :P

Make reservations! The place fills up and you'll need them if you wish to eat.

I didn't get to try the buffet, but I hear that it is only offered for lunch and the quality/food is different (note... not better or worse).

My friend and I ordered foods that we typically order from other Thai restaurants (for comparison purposes). We had the pad thai, pad see ew, green curry and drunken noodle with seafood.

I'm a little indifferent about the pad thai. My friend and I noticed that the tamarand sauce wasn't as strong so more of the other flavors came through (oils, peanuts, tofu, etc.). This can be interpreted as being a little more bland, but also appreciated since it wasn't overwhelming. My friend said that he's had better green curry. I haven't, but then again I haven't had too much of a comparison. The drunken noodle seafood was GREAT! With a plethora of seafood sprinkled all over a mound of noodles (flat rice noodles). This was all covered with gravy and makes my mouth water even now. The pad see ew was also delicious!

I will be returning. In this next trip I hope to try their soft-shelled crab, lobster, beef jerky and catfish... I can't wait!

Be ware... the strip mall/neighborhood isn't the greatest...."}
{"text":"We ordered Golden Tofu (7.99), Larb Koong (14.99) and Kang Omm (10.99) online.

The Golden Tofu was generic, tasteless, watery fried tofu that I could have had done better, at any other Thai place, for $4.

I ordered the Larb Koong extra spicy, 9 out of 10, but there was no \"extra\" spiciness at all, as far as I could tell. Either they don't read the notes from online orders or they don't care. I also paid two dollars extra for a large size, and got a side-salad sized order that I ate in about a half-dozen bites. It was tasty, and if I had paid six dollars for it, instead of 15, I would be pretty happy.

EDIT: I looked at the receipt given to me by the driver; the restaurant gave me a small Larb Koong after Doordash charged me for a large. So that reinforces my guess that they're not reading the online orders closely.

The Kang Omm had good flavor, but the chicken was anemic; there were three, small pieces of chicken in this dish, and it came with approximately a quarter cup of rice. But the wee little box of rice was cute, like a novelty-sized takeout container, and that was nice. 

Recommended if you like small amounts of over-priced takeout."}
{"text":"We went to Lotus of Siam last night.  We were seated 15 minutes early, which was great.  Beautiful menu and wine list.  We ordered appetizers and entrees quickly.  Within 10 minutes we had our apps.  However, we watched other tables pay their bills, new folks get seated, and have food served before our main entrees came.  We waited at least an hour before our waiter (who was running around working hard all night) noticed we didn't have our food.  His excuse was that the kitchen was packed.  We believed this because the restaurant was packed, but he wasn't telling the truth because other tables who were seated after us were finishing up their meals and paying their bills.  Kind of a bummer not to be comped on anything when it was clear our order was messed up somehow.  I know accidents happen, but admit it!  I still gave 4 stars because the wait staff was very nice and friendly and the food was unbelievable, unlike any Thai I've had.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Having just returned to Las Vegas for a quick business trip early this week, I had to make a few visits to some of my fave haunts when I lived here. Of course, LoS was high on the list and it didn't disappoint!

LoS always gets the following accolades: \"gotten the nod from the James Beard Foundation\", \"the place where all the local chefs come to eat\", \"one of the best Thai restaurants in North America\", blah blah blah. Everyone has said it, heard it and knows it. Whatever. It's great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friend's Thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen!

A few noteworthy changes if you haven't been there in awhile (since March 2010 according to our waiter):
1. They've expanded into the now defunct Korean restaurant that used to be on the right side of the LoS.
2. They've remodeled the inside...it's no longer the \"hole-in-the-wall\" greatness it used to be...everything is def. more upscale albeit in the same dive Commerical Center with the Green Door*.
3. They expanded the old wine \"cabinet\" into a friggin' 15' glass wine cellar centered prominently in the middle of the newly redecorated interior. Way cool!
4. There's a nice new shiny bar on the far right side of the resto - cool.
5. 2 sets of bathroom now - the older \"boys\" and \"girls\" side on the left and now the much nicer and (thank God) larger (multi-stalls) \"men\" and \"women\" bathrooms on the left side. No more waiting in the hallways!

A few extra notes/details on the food (this visit):
1. We ordered four entrees (Pad See Ew, Mee Krob, Tofu Penang Curry and a Northern style curry made with catfish) and 2 apps (Tom Kha Gai and Tod Mun) for 5 people. Plenty of food and everyone finished up the meal for bill of $75 including 4 drinks. Not bad!
2. Spice level was low for this meal at a \"5\"  b/c we were catering to a wide range of palates, but as a note you can always request the pepper rack for those that want more. Honestly tho, if you do request the \"10\"...it's spicy greatness and you won't be disappointed...but just be aware. I love it at the level. 
3. What I loved the most (generally speaking) was the delicate flavours of the dishes. I didn't find any sort of heavy handedness when it came to the flavor profiles - not too sweet, not too gunky (no fillers), etc.
4. The Penang was incredible and had this beautiful creamy nuttiness to it....you could taste the complexities of flavours in it - a richness from the coconut milk, not too sweet, with hints of the kefir in it. Just a note, if you haven't been here...most dishes can be substituted for veggie friendly (i.e., tofu) and they willingly suggest it if you can't find something you like.
5. The Pad See Ew was gorgeous. It had that high heat smoky flavor to it I crave in the dish. Not too sweet and a balanced flavour with the basil leaves - i.e., not overly \"basily\" as some places make it. So good...you could taste the individual ingredients in the dish!
6. I wasn't a fan of the Mee Krob, but it was tasty and well done. It's just not my favorite dish for Thai cuisine.
7. The Tod Mun is done the way I like it. Thin patties that are just luscious and perfectly seasoned/fried and complemented with the cucumber dressing. The crispness of the cabbage and the cucumbers provides the perfect textural complement to the home made fish patties with bits of green onions throughout.
8. The Tom Kha Gai had that nice bit of sourness and just enough heat to start off the meal properly. A very flavourful broth with the bits of lemon grass and galangal throughout.
9. The unique and different item was the northern Thai style curry - it was very broth-like but good. Almost reminiscent of the Thom Kha Gai, but no lemongrass in it. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, but found it more mild in taste and the flavours were *VERY* subtle and refined. So, if you're expecting bold typical Thai flavours...be warned and you might want to pass on this dish. Otherwise, it's a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order.

A few notes on service:
Excellent as always. Not too invasive, yet not too rushed. We had a leisurely dinner therefor several hours - even after finishing our meal, we sat and continued talking and never once felt like we were being rushed out. They even came by and refilled out drinks while we talked!

If you haven't figured this out...yeah, I love and miss this place a lot. Living on the east coast now really highlights how different and how much better the Thai food is out west. Eitherway, if you're visiting or you already live in Las Vegas, LoS is a helluva good joint! You won't be disappointed. Now, only if they would Fedex their food.....

*If you have to ask...you don't want to know."}
{"text":"Does this place really have over 2400 reviews?  If you can't tell, the word is out on this place.  And it won't disappoint.  So why would I need to add one more review to an overwhelming outpouring of opinion?  Just to add some cautions:

1) Make the chefs happy and go for the back of the menu where the specialties are.  Don't even think about ordering Pad Thai!

2)  If you like Riesling, they have an overwhelming list.  But we always seem to get a bottle that has gone into secondary fermentation.  If you consider a bit of gas to be a fault (as I do), you'll likely have to return it for something else.  Or just give up and enjoy the bubbly!

3)  Watch the temp on the spice, it gets hot FAST.  Bring facial tissues and enjoy the heat.

4)  MAKE RESERVATIONS, ASAP!  While they seem to make every effort to accommodate those without, this place is ridiculously popular and will always be booked up.

5)  Don't judge a book by its cover.  When you pull up, it will look like a dump.  The area is old, run down and looks a bit scary, though it's largely abandoned.  Go inside and you will find a nice restaurant.

But do go and try it.  It is really good if you order right!"}
{"text":"May be my favorite restaurant, period. Their shrimp dishes (especially garlic shrimp, grilled shrimp) are like nothing else you've ever tried. The best thing to do is ask the waiters what they suggest. No lie, every single dish here is amazing."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant on a high recommendation of a friend.  I was sooo disappointed.  First, there was a long wait of almost an hour for a Tuesday night.  A look around told me I was really in for it.  Seemed like a tourist place.  Ordered a porched Chilean sea bass on a salad.  The sea bass was totally overcooked, and the salad mainly consist of julian apples, onions, etc.  Totally bad.  Ordered a pork curry, which is more like a curry soup.  We complained that the sea bass was totally dry, and the answer I got was: \"It is supposedly cooked like that\"!  And the Chilean cost $30.00.  I will never go back to that place again!"}
{"text":"Best thai food I've ever had. hands down. There are many delicious places to eat in vegas, but I always try to stop by when I'm in town. Not too much to add to the other stellar reviews. Yes, the place is in a run-down strip mall, and you may accidentally walk into the indian restaurant next door (try to avoid that, it's pretty embarrassing). Make reservations well in advance, especially if you're a large party. When I went a couple weeks ago, it looked like they weren't taking any reservations until August. We loved their pad thai, crispy duck panang with stick rice (omg so good), and kho soi with short rib (not as good without the short rib)."}
{"text":"We give this place 3 stars. The service was great but the food didn't amaze us.

We ordered:

Pad Thai: our favorite noodle dish that we always order.  The amount in the plate is fairly small compared to all the pad thai's we've had so I was disappointed.  The sauce and noodle ratio was off because there was too much sauce.  Despite this, we liked the pad Thai.

Shrimp Fried Rice: again, very small amount. We had to order two more sides of white rice (there was only two of us).

Pad Prik King: it was spicy and that was about it. I honestly don't remember the taste because it didn't make an impact on my taste buds.  There was nothing remarkable about this dish.  Won't be ordering this again.

Yellow Curry:  I LOVE YELLOW CURRY.  But this was probably the worst yellow curry I've ever tasted.  Not because it was disgusting, but because the chicken had no taste.  The soup part of the curry was good but once I bit into the chicken, there was no taste.  Absolutely disappointing.

Overall, since we rarely come to Vegas, we probably will never be back to this place again the next time we vacation because there are so many other restaurants in Vegas.  The food in this place was a miss on our first visit so we will try other restaurants."}
{"text":"There are many car washes in Las Vegas. Some are good and many are just terrible. Alamo Hand Car Wash on Rainbow is just about the best in the entire city.
The work is done by hand so the car finish is protected and everyone seems to genuinely care about your car.
Most important, is the warm and friendly welcome you receive when you pull in for service. There is a man named Felipe who greets you like a long lost friend. His warm, caring attitude is the reason I keep coming back. Sometimes twice a week to keep my cars looking new. He may not know your name but he will get to know you and your car. If he suggests a coat of wax, you probably need it. I know, when he's suggested an added service it is because he genuinely takes interest in how my cars look and, the funny thing is, he's always been right.

When you pull in, say \"hi\" to Felipe. His warm attitude will start your experience at Alamo in such a pleasant manner that the time they take to care for your car will all be worth it.
Without this kind gentleman, Alamo might just be another good car wash. With him there to greet me, I feel like I am coming to a friend to personally take care of my prized possession. 
By the way, their complimentary coffee is quite good, as well."}
{"text":"There is a reason Lotus of Siam is on everybody's list as best places in Las Vegas.  I've been there at least 10 times and it has been excellent every time.  The menu is extensive, so the last few times I've asked the server to make suggestions and ordered based on those suggestions.  They haven't steered me wrong."}
{"text":"Very new interior from what I remember. Food is good but high priced. More like on the Strip than in an off the beaten path mall. Went for lunch and no lunch menu. Food is very good Thai food so still desirable if you want a change."}
{"text":"If you're debating Lotus of Siam or Komol, then let me help you out, Lotus of Siam!  We were in the same predicament the other day, and wrongfully chose Komol.  You can read my review.

Lotus of Siam had their lunch special buffet.  Choices are limited, probably like 6 main dishes, and 3 sides to choose from. Loved the friend chicken wings, loved the fried rice.  The pad thai wasn't very good though.  The stir fried was okay.  The fried bananas were okay..  The fried curry was gross."}
{"text":"Soup was just ok. I enjoyed the drunken noodle with prawns but preferred the crispy duck with panang sauce. So delicious!! Price was on the high side."}
{"text":"It's cheap and it's great.

I always  eat here when I'm in Las Vegas. 

I was disappointed that they were closed for remodeling during my Nov visit."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the valley. I cannot believe that I have yet to review them. I have eaten here on several occasions over the past 4 1/2 years and I have several favorite dishes. The crispy duck with Panang curry is my favorite. The service is always impeccable but be careful and make a reservation if you are in a time budget. They do get very busy. The wine and beer selections are incredible as well as the atmosphere. Celebrity pictures all over the walls posing with the owner of this fine establishment. I recommend Lotus of Siam to everyone I meet in Las Vegas, telling them that it is the best restaurant in the valley. And they never disappoint. Try them out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!  The first time I came here was about two years ago and right after enjoying the Nutcracker at the Smith Center. 

I had read about this place before and looked at its list of reviewers.  One after the other giving it praise.  

I convinced my family to try it out and once we parked I could tell no one was thrilled about the way it looked from the outside or the sketchy area it seemed to be in.  Once we walked inside, I could tell it was huge, way bigger than it gives off from the outside and it was jammed packed ( always a good sign when trying someplace new).  The host told us it would be a 2 hour minimum wait.  At those words my BF began to walk back towards the door, he hates waiting, let alone two hours ( which, when youre hungry is an eternity). I was so excited to try it but two hours is kinda long, we could always come back! 

As I begin to make my way to the door a man standing in line, leans over and tells me its worth the wait.  Dammit, now I want to wait.  

I round everyone back up and tell them its going to be amazing.  We can wait!  Plus we can enjoy each others company and spend some quality time chatting with each other.  

If youve ever been there before, youll know that there isnt really anywhere to wait. Sure, you could go outside, but in December its a bit chilly.  Inside, theres a little waiting room that holds about four people max.  Its pretty tight and those chairs should be saved for someone that perhaps cant stand as long.  

We end up against the glass wall to the wine room.  In the direct path of all the waiters pushing carts loaded with hot plates of amazingness, back and forth from the kitchen to the large dining room near the bar.  Talk about torture.  

Our wait ended up being about 1:45 minutes and after viewing and smelling the amazing dishes going back and forth we had a good idea of what we wanted.  And you know what?  Completly worth it!!!

We ordered a few different plates and shared them all.  Nothing was left, everything was enjoyed and devoured!! 

I know that I used the word amazing way too many times but that's how I feel about this place!  Simply AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"It was good. In a sketchy area with a warning on the door that they've had a lot of car break ins. Extensive wine list featuring wines from almost any country. I'm not sure that it was amazing enough to travel outside of Summerlin tho"}
{"text":"Went here based on the recommendation by other yelpers. I was surprised that the place is pretty big for a mom and pop establishment. 
We reached on a Saturday evening and packed with at least 3-4 groups waiting for ahead of us. I was amazed how quickly they moved people around. Just waited for 5 mins!!!

Ambiance / Décor: Nothing great about the ambiance, standard run of the mill place. The location of the bar is a little strange, its right at the end of the dining area, so you see a lot of people moving around while waiting for the tables. 

Server: Our server was very attentive and friendly. He cracked a few jokes and kept the conversation lively. Also checked on us time to time.

Food: The food was good. We tried drunken noodles and green curry. I found that they used more basil compared to other places... I love basil in all forms, so had nothing to complain. Their spice level are a little inconsistent, on a scale of 1-10 we ordered 7 for both our entrée. Drunken noodles were not spicy whereas the green curry literally made me sweat due to spice.

Overall: Good food. If you love Thai food this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on The Best I Ever Ate on the food network so I was super excited to try it out. It's of the strip away from the glitz of Vegas. even with that I was a little dismayed when I saw the exterior. IM GLAD I did not let that dissuade me. once you get through the door it's a nice clean grade A establishment and the food are AWESOME . if you go to Las Vegas Please give them a try the food is great and the staff is very friendly and inviting even when they are super super busy. the stuffed chicken wings are a MUST!!! I will always come here when I visit Sin City. I hope you will too"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas Hands down. May be a wait but there is a reason why and its worth it everytime."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore spicy food, and Thai food obviously can fit the bill.  I do not live in Las Vegas, nor do I visit very often, but I do know good Thai food when I see it, and this is pretty solid.  What makes it 5 stars vs 4?  The wine list!  Amazing selection of German wine for very reasonable prices.  A perfect companion which cuts through the rich and intense flavors of many of the dishes here.  The menu is huge and I cannot claim to be an authority as an infrequent tourist, but the Nam Kao Tod is a fabulous appetizer.  Any variation of the Pad Kee Mao (particularly with crab) ordered spicy is amazing, but the my favorite dish here is the duck panang.  They fry strips of duck breast (breaded)  until crispy and then drizzle with a rich and distinctive panang which is far spicier than many editions I have had elsewhere.  Combine with a Donnhoff riesling and coconut ice cream to finish, and you have a fabulous treat of a meal...  Do not miss when in Vegas if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant, hidden gem in a dated shopping plaza. Don't be deterred by the appearance of the parking lot. The food was all great, and fairly reasonably priced. Something to be noted is that spicy actually means spicy here. I usually like my food spicy, so I tend to order very spicy at other restaurants but was forewarned before coming and was glad I ordered medium spicy so that my food was still enjoyable. We had yellow curry, pad see ewe, laht nah, pork stew, beef salad and spicy mint leaf chicken. Everything was wonderful! Service was excellent. I actually thought I had left my purse there, and when I went back, they went above and beyond to be helpful, even checked surveillance cameras for me. The staff was amazing showing integrity in the way they do customer service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yes this restaurant is legendary and written about as one of the best Thai in the country for good reason. Yes the Khao soi and nam khao tod (to name a few) are beyond superb. 

There is however a significant flaw in the overall dining experience at Lotus that must be spoken of. The service/hospitality is an afterthought. With a menu as encyclopedic as this, one wishes to be guided but this is never delivered. What is the point of an encyclopedic menu into regional Thai cuisine along with an equally impressive wine list to boot if the customer is not appropriately guided."}
{"text":"11/08: Came back here during yet another conference, this time with my boss and other team members. Still, to the mark, good food and great service. We had to wait a little bit this time but all over again a good experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Thai foods in Asia and in the U.S, this is not the best but one of the better Thai places to eat... Tonight was my first time and I know I will be back again.... excellent food and excellent service."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  Not in the best neighborhood, but the food is wonderful!!!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. The restaurant is big and clean. The tables are setup like cafeteria style so not a whole lot of privacy.   We ordered our typical dishes; pad Thai, pad see ewu, rhad nard, and their special crispy duck panang. The dishes are ok. Nothing special. The pad Thai was a bit on the sour side. The panang was really good but nothing special about the duck. For a $27 dish I expected something more. 

Our waiter wasn't the best.  Not much personality. 

Don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the US outside east Asia! We started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right back to Bangkok. Followed up with some fried tofu with an outstanding sweet chilli sauce. The crispy duck in Penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unexpected. The chilli rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus. I like slightly hot -spicy and a chilli rating of 6 for the Panang chicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good! Lastly, the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done, ripe mango with warm pudding like, slightly coconut flavored sticky rice. The beauty of Lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordinary form the extraordinary. Portions were generous and service was very good. Don't be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price ($70 with tip for two) as it is really \"Thai\" food."}
{"text":"This place rocks, take out is key, the wait is long but the food is outstanding, such a variety of thai food, they do have a good lunch buffet as well."}
{"text":"All of the other reviews are true! This restaurant was the highlight of my trip-yum. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because we ordered food that was a spice level of \"6\" along with a spice level of \"10\" and they had the same level of heat. (And my hot pepper-loving friend was very disappointed.) Otherwise we loved every bite of our food. I love Thai food and it doesn't get much better than this. We went on a weekend - make sure to call early to add your name to the list. If I ever return to Vegas, I'm taking a cab straight to Lotus of Siam-yum!"}
{"text":"The menu had so many delicious dishes to choose from. Seemed like there was a 100 different dishes and I love when restaurants offer a great variety. After trying to narrow down what to order, I said fuck it ! Let's order everything.  The steak tartar was almost perfect. Just a touch of sweetness and lime would've really rounded out the flavors but maybe that's not a true northern Thai steak tartar. Also had the Thai prawn sashimi, Panang short ribs koa soi, grilled steak dish , golden prawns, soft shell crab wide rice stir fry noodle dish, Tom yum soup ( soup was just okay) . Everything was pretty flavorful . I came on a Monday around 1:30 and the wait was not very long at all. I will def be back the next time I'm in town. Tried so hard to take a pic of the food but my mouth got to it all first oops"}
{"text":"Soooo dissapointed :((( Chef Saipin Chutima would of been ashamed of whomever cooked my entree! I had waited two months to visit as a special occasion for my birthday and I passed up going to Ramsay's Steak House for this!  We moved here 3 months ago from Seattle  where there is an abundance of Asian restaurants so I know good Thai food!!! First, yes it's a little whole in the  wall which I was prepared for from doing my research but REALLY their sign wasn't even illuminated on the building making it difficult to even see the dang place in the dark. Then the hour long wait even though i called promptly when their doors opened that evening to make reservations and was told they where full. Finally seated, I had already chosen my entree by looking at there website and although I wanted to order 12 things I chose a fave of Moo Yang.  Had an appetizer of tempura, I have never had tempura with thick crunchy  batter.....that's not tempura. And it was suppose to be vege and shrimp, there where 4 small pieces of vege and the shrimp had been cut in half all for 10.95.  For such a huge menu was disappointing there wasn't no crab rangoons or fresh rolls on there app menu. My entre of Moo Yang was DRY almost shamefully so! No vege's  just a plate of meat that looked like it was tossed around the plate to make it appear it fllled the plate......... horrible presentation.and when the server offered me sticky rice I anxiously said yes but he failed to tell me he was going to charge me an extra 2.00. My husband had crab fried rice, rice looked like it was FRIED for maybe five seconds, just a plate of steamed rice as far as i was concerned.  Last observation I made no spices on the table!!!! Come on!!!! This place is renowned so being busy doesn't cut it!  There decor was not aesthetically pleasing especially the numerous pictures on the wall above me of chef and various clients in cheap frames and hanging crooked on the wall.  I have no intentions on every returning, So now my quest goes on for some descent Thai food! Having some serious withdrawals!!! I miss my Chili Thai :(((("}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a few years but I can see from the reviews that it is still the best place to eat in Las Vegas. We are here for lunch during the week the first time and you never know who you will be eating with because it is a locals favorite."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Sketchy shopping center. There was a line to get in. Surprised to see how spacious and well decorated it was inside. Recommend the crispy rice as an appetizer and the khao soi short ribs. That's what Anthony Bourdain had. Great choice. Gotta try this place when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I never post reviews on yelp. This place is worth it, came twice in 4 days. Amazing food, come early or late as it is always full. 

Order the #14 (crispy rice) lime cilantro crispy delicious. 

Order the crispy duck with panang, perfect."}
{"text":"Let me explain my reasons for the review. I think the food was average and normally  would have given 2 stars or at best 2.5 stars. I have been to Thailand at least 4-5 times and I know what food should taste like. And this is the second time I have eaten here. The food was better and more authentic before. Somehow their quality has gone down.......probably they have become complacent. It is a pity to see a good restaurant drop so much in quality. Let me more specific....their starters i.e. Tom Yum soup was just spicy without the flavors. When we reordered they made it so bland that it was difficult to finish it. I patiently went ahead with the order for main dish hoping that the starter was an anomaly and each and every dish was below to just around average.  

The service is absolutely atrocious. They gave me an estimate of the  wait of 1.5 hrs, and then suddenly they texted within 30 minutes that the table is waiting. Then within 10 minutes of the  text they cancelled my place in the line. I managed to get back and wish my place in line was really taken. The main dish took almost 1 hr and that too when we had to remind the server at least 3 times. The whole sub-par meal with horrible service including  the co-ordination took me about 3 hrs . And this is when we had so many other options in Vegas. What a waste. For average to below average food, a stip mall location, it is just not worth it. 

hence the 1 star."}
{"text":"Literally the best Thai food I have ever had! We talked to the server and had him send out an assortment of different things, most ones that I have never tried, and I am glad I tried them!  We had the Crispy Duck Panang, Garlic Prawns, and Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles just to name a few things.  We also dove into their Riesling list and had a great time!  Had several bottles that paired awesomely with the food, and to end night with a bang had a 30 year old bottle of Riesling to celebrate a birthday!  Amazing night!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch buffet places. Although, you don't get a hugh selection of food.... I love, love, love their pad thai, fried chicken wings, banana egg roll, sweet potato dumplings are SOOO GOOD!  There's a sweet white dressing that I dip the chicken in to get the sweet and salty fix. So yummy!  

Good service.  It's better now now that they have expanded. I always over do it here.  I guess why that's why we have gyms."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this restaurant but it was OK....rather disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Get there early, or call to make reservation. Green curry was cook to perfection. We also ordered the crispy duck with the drunken noodle WOW! Simply wow!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai Cuisine.  If you don't know what to order, tell the waiter to just bring you some favorite dishes.  You will not be disappointed.  Unfortunately, there is generally a long wait.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to heaven! The best Pad Se-ew, I have ever eaten! The broccoli is fresh and tender and the noodles and sauce were perfect. We loved the garlic prawns and the table side hot pot of Tom Kah Kai is now a family favorite. Reservations are a must, unless you can sneak in, upon doors opening."}
{"text":"We try to eat at lotus every time we are in Vegas. We are originally from Los Angeles, and will plan to leave from la at 6am to make sure we get there in time for lunch because it's just that good. Real good. That good, good. The garlic prawns. The crispy duck curry. Gooooooood. So good, that we will forego Vegas strip restaurants and go back on Saturday night, and wait an hour for a table so we can experience those prawns and crispy duck curry all over again. You can't go wrong with anything on the Northern Specialties section of the menu. We are making our way down the menu one trip to Vegas at a time. Absolutely one of the best thai places, hands down."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the world !!! #14 Nam Kao Tod don't ask just order it quite possibly the best most flavorful unique dish in LV. The Garlic Prawns are beyond amazing and the simple cashew nut chicken was spot on . The Papaya salad is off the chain but Holy Heatwave Batman the spice is white hot (which I like but buyer beware) If you normally get a #7 or 8 spice get the 3 or 4 and you will be golden . I am a wine gal and I must say without a doubt the best wine list in all of Las Vegas including the strip. And the pricing is way way low . I would say more but I have a nail appointment !! TTFN ... Love ya Lotus ."}
{"text":"Can I just say...WOW?! This place is amazing!!! After reading the mostly awesome reviews of Lotus, I was eager to try it. I went with about 5 other girls for a bday dinner. We made reservations for dinner, so there was no waiting or anything like that.

Food: The food is delicious. While I do appreciate my go-to, hole-in-the-wall Thai place, \"King and I\", down the street, I think that the quality of Lotus' food is much higher. Some of the dishes we had (we had a lot, so I don't remember the names of all of them), but red curry with duck, panang curry with tofu and chicken, drunken noodles with sea bass, papaya salad, glass noodles with chicken, crispy rice, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All of them were delicious. My personal faves were the drunken noodles and panang curry. We also had dessert...mango with sweet sticky rice, and fried bananas with ice cream....yummm! We also had two bottles of wine. It was a LOT of food, and we only ended up paying about $45 bucks each between 6 girls...a pretty good deal, considering how much we ordered, and we were stuffed at the end.

Service: The waiter was very attentive. Plenty of refills without asking. 

Decor: Nothing fancy, but it has a nice ambiance, moreso than your typical hole-in-the-wall.

Location: It's kind of in a sketchy part of neighborhood, Sahara Ave and  Commercial Ctr. There are some other restaurants around, like a Korean bbq restaurant. 

If you're looking for fantastic Thai food in the Vegas area, check this place out, you won't be disappointed. I'd come here more often if I didn't live on the opposite side of town!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever.  Once you find it and experience the food, you will want to go back to explore the amazing menu variety."}
{"text":"This place was on food TV so I thought I'd give it a try while we were out in Vegas. It's a real hole in the wall in a strip mall but it gets better once you're seated. The service is pretty fast and friendly. 

I would compare this place to President Thai in San Gabriel and Star of Siam in Long Beach in terms of flavor and service. It's really good, but I dunno if I would agree that it's the best in America, you know? I don't think the portions here are as big as they are in So Cal either, but it's nice to have such Thai food in an area of up-scale restaurants and buffets up the wazoo. It's a nice spot if you wanna change things up or wanna save some money for the tables by dining off the strip.

I think I give it an extra star because if it wasn't for food TV and Lotus of Siam, I never would have known there was a Leatherby's there! God I miss Leatherby's.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. This place came highly recommended, and it is clear why. We shared a variety of dishes and everything was wonderful. The drunken noodle prawns were a favorite, and the pad Thai was the best we've ever had. They also had a seriously impressive and extensive wine list, and great service."}
{"text":"Not too far from the strip and it is a jewel.  I had lunch and was too hungry to wait so had the Buffett  it was yummey.  The Phad Thai was so good.  Everything on the Buffett was perfect.  Do not miss this.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Took a business colleague here for a working dinner. I won't try to remember the names of what we ordered, except to say that it was flavorful and delicious.

What really knocked us out is that the service was in top 5% of places I have ever been to, and that includes some high end Michelin-rated places.

A great experience, great food and EXCEPTIONAL service. I'd go again in a minute."}
{"text":"Love this place.  On every trip to LV I have to come here.

Usually I do the lunch buffet, 11:30am-2:30pm, $9.99, but they have an extensive menu along with a wonderful selection of wines if you want something that is not offered at the buffet.

You can have it \"your way\" as far as the heat/spice factor as they will prepare it to your taste.  

For first timers, the location is not particularly appealing, but once inside the restaurant you will enjoy the food, excellent service, and reasonable prices.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to sign up for Yelp for a while, but my experience at Lotus of Siam made it happen. I lived in Thailand for about 7 months including Chiang Mai (where I found out the owner is from) for 3. I've never tasted Thai food in America that comes close to the street food out there, until I tried Lotus of Siam. 

We got the Khao Soi, Tom Yum Gai, Pad Thai, and Panang Curry. Everything was perfect. It's as authentic as it gets, which I can see turning off some people who are used to Americanized Thai food, but everyone in our group loved it. The soup was the perfect balance of sour and spicy. Khao Soi is one of my favorite foods and I don't remember the last time I saw it on a menu - Lotus of Siam did it perfectly. The Pad Thai and Curry were great too.

Prices were reasonable for the quality and they had a surprisingly good beer selection (at a great price for craft beers). Our waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly. It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while. If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here multiple times per week. Only downside is you need a car or a long taxi ride to get there, and while the place was beautifully decorated, the boxes of wine stored behind the glass didn't look great in an otherwise impressive display. That is a very minor issue that I probably only notice because I work in the industry. There seem to be a lot of Thai places in Vegas but this should definitely be the one to try."}
{"text":"The sea bass on drunken noodles is my personal favorite, but so far every dish I've had here has been delicious. And great service to boot, but don't be surprised to wait for a table. The word is getting out about how good the food is."}
{"text":"Tucked in a strip mall on E. Sahara Avenue, Lotus of Siam is a major hit for excellent Thai cuisine. We experienced this little gem on a Friday night and, at least that night, I'm glad we had reservations. The restaurant was packed. So, consider yourself warned ... we were told they would only hold reservations for five minutes. You snooze, you lose.

The restaurant is somewhat casual, so shorts and a tee-shirt would have sufficed, but a few of our group of four were dressed for a show and gambling at one of the upscale properties. Each of us would have felt comfortable either way.

The delight of Lotus of Siam is not the decor or the layout; it's the food. Sooooo good. And there are more selections than one might need -- but who's to complain?! We ordered four entrees: Garlic Prawns (at the suggestion of the server); Chicken Panang; Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles (again, at the suggestion of the server); and Pineapple Fried Rice.

All were excellent choices. The Garlic Prawns topped with ground black pepper were oh-so-lightly deep fried in their paper thin shells. No need to peel these crispy little delicacies -- eat 'em shell and all! The Chicken Panang contained plenty of thinly sliced chicken breast medallions soaking in a heavenly, light curry/coconut/basil/chili sauce. You may need to keep the sticky rice bowl handy, as the Panang and sticky rice mix well together. The Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles had a nice contrast of flavors between the fresh chili and Thai basil, while the fish itself maintained the mellow flavor characteristic of good sea bass. And, finally, the Pineapple Fried Rice containing curry powder, pineapple, shrimp and chicken was a good little addition -- especially with the contrast of the pineapple to the traditional Thai flavors of the other entrees.

I can't eat Thai food without a Singha lager beer, which I enjoyed. Others in my group shared a bottle of wine from a reasonably long list of wines from various areas of the world. (They selected a Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand -- which at least is from the same hemisphere as Thailand!)

This was the best Thai food restaurant that I've been to, hands down. And I've been to Thailand!"}
{"text":"Crave in Downtown Summerlin. -awesome service, great ambiance and superb menu selections.  The salmon salad was the best I have ever had.  Jessica you rock!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located a mile off the main las vegas strip on sahara. Do not be put off by the neighborhood or run down exterior of  the building, as inside the restaurant is modern and roomy- they have had to expand twice over the last few years due to its booming popularity. I have never had a bad dish here, mainly due to chef Saipan's great use of the spices. My favorite is the crispy duck with panang sauce, but the salt& pepper shrimp, Tom yum noodle soup and all the curries are  wonderful. You will need a reservation, so call ahead."}
{"text":"Very good. Nice staff, good prices. My foreign friend had never had the fried banana desert. He liked it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, organized, with friendly attentive staff.  The food is not bad, but really just average.  I had hoped for a burst of fresh spices in the dishes, like ginger and mint, garlic, lemongrass, etc... but the flavor was just so-so and more oily than the other Thai places."}
{"text":"Whoa, for some strange reason I haven't written a review on this place; crazy as I've been to Lotus for lunch upwards of 20 times...seriously.  People at my work love this place, and different people have different days they like to go.  Consequently, I think I've been here at least once for each day of the week.  But, as a caveat, I've only done the buffet, although I may be a rebel next time and order off the menu.

Anyways, my experience has been that the food is generally always good; sometimes, it's better on certain days than others.  Like not a specific day of the week, but for example, sometimes it's better on one particular Wednesday than a previous visit on a Wednesday.  

One person at work eats religiously at Lotus on Tuesdays for the soup.  I personally think the soup is best on Fridays, not the egg drop soup but the other soup (the name of which I can't remember now).  It's mildly spicy, which I appreciate because I don't love super spicy food, and it also has the right amount of saltiness...really, it hits the spot as the chilly weather descends on Vegas.

There's also really good mint chicken, and the main chicken dish on Wednesdays is delicious!  However, my favorite part of the buffet is the fried banana rolls, which are always present at the buffet party.  Oh-M-Gee, I would marry those things, you know, if I wasn't already married, if it were possible to marry fried rolls, etc., etc.     

I wouldn't necessarily crown Lotus the culinary king of the world but it's consistently good, flavorful and satisfying.  And that gets a good mark in my book!"}

Clean tasting Thai food, without the fishy or oily flavor/taste.

We really enjoyed ourselves here.

They can make food super spicy, so beware when you ask them to make it spicy.

Food was on point. We ordered a lot of veggie dishes.

- fried tofu
- Thai fried rice
- pad see ew
- cashew tofu
- basil tofu
- yellow curry

Not one bad dish to report.

Oh, one thing though, they do add on 18% gratuity for big parties. So be prepared to fork over a large tip. Lol."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love it!  We've been there many times. Don't be frightened by the location, once you are inside, it's all good.  The food is amazing and the wine selection is spectacular.  They even take special care in polishing the wine glasses... Classy!  It's always busy, better to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I made a reservation one month in advance anticipating an amazing meal based on all that I had read regarding the restaurant.  Our group of four were in universal agreement that the menu was extensive and even exotic.  The meals were very good but not outstanding.  And the service was at best marginal.  None of us would rush back."}

{"text":"Me and my wife moved to Las Vegas a few years ago and we saw the anthony bourdain special on CNN referring to Lotus of Siam.  We made a note to try it out but couldn't find the time with the new baby on the way.   This past few months we were able to go for dinner and bring our 18 month old with us.    Whenever I eat Thai, I always order the same thing \"Spicy Basil with Rice\" with number 4 heat index.   I probably have sampled this dish at atleast 20 different restaurants around the country.   Lotus of Siam is by far the best.  I don't know what they are doing exactly but it tastes amazing.   We ordered some chicken satays for our little one and cut them up in small peaces.   They were not too spicy and he ate all 3 of them."}

The seafood fried rice was very delicious. 
Service was ok. Kinda slow."}

Price is very good than in house hotels 
The all in house hotel restaurants are over priced 
Expensive than San Francisico New York"}
{"text":"This is definitely not my favorite spot when it comes to Thai food, but for the most part the food is ok. Upon entering, you won't be impressed with the indoor decor. It definitely does not stand out. In fact, my first impression upon entering was that I was some place dodgy where I was sure to get sick. Fortunately, that was not the case. There were certainly a lot of patrons during the lunch hour which is usually a good sign of a good place to eat.

Lotus of Siam offers a Thai buffet. I took a moment to look at the items offered at the buffet. To me, the food looked like it had been sitting out a while, but my friends who did opt for the buffet raved about it. Instead, I decided to order off the menu. I had the typical Farang dish, Chicken Pad Thai. The dish was fairly decent, although I definitely had better.

One thing I was not impressed with and weighed heavily in giving this establishment a 3 out of five stars is the fact that I was unimpressed with the service. We waited a long time to be served. Also, we ordered a thai ice tea and water. A good 15 minutes must of passed and we still didn't have our tea. By this time, my companion was cotton mouthed due to the lack of liquid to quench her thirst.I reminded the server again, and another 10 minutes passed before he finally came out with it. 

Definitely not the worst and definitely not the best."}
{"text":"They have great food!!
I ate here 3 times and tried different things every time and everything was so great.
(loved loved their duck with drunken noodle)

I reduced one star because 
1) little portion - 3 girls, had to order 4 dishes and my friends don't even eat much.
2) MSG - my body somehow overreacts everytime I eat too much MSG, and I had to drink a lot of water everytime I ate here.
3) service - they obviously want you to leave right after you finished with your dish.

but despite the fact that I had to drink a gallon of water everytime I eat here
I will definitely be back here to eat. 
their food was that good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  I know good food because I'm from NYC, and this place has Thai Food that is a cut above any I've ever had.  Must haves: Green Papya Salad, Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodle with Sea Bass.  I've dined here many time and have never ever been disappointed.  I know it's off the strip, but the some of the best things in Vegas are off the strip, and this is the best example of that.  Don't go to too spicy: a 5 level spice blew us away."}
{"text":"The food here is great. And it's very authentic.

What I don't like so much about the place is that it is pretty noisy and you get a feeling that you are in a rush.

Conclusion: If you only care about the food, this is one of the best places to eat Thai food. If you are looking for a quiet place, there are better options."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times that my \"food I've had here list\" would exceed Yelp limits, swears.

Anyways, everything I've had here exceeded expectations but there's always one dish that I tell anyone visiting to get and that's the Garlic Prawns. If you've had it, you know what I mean and if you haven't then you will know what I mean ;) It's a large dish, I say definitely meant to be shared!

This place also gets my vote for the *best buffet* in Vegas. Quality is on par and the price is kinda shocking (because it's so cheap!!!!) Curry is my faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav. *drool*

They pretty recently renovated and doubled the size of the place, which I was very happy to see because when I first started going, there was usually a 45 min wait for dinner.

I suggest you high-tail it there asap."}
{"text":"I think this place is over-rated. For their high prices, the quality and quantity of food should be much better. We can get Thai food that is at least as good for half the price in Los Angeles. We had the coconut chicken soup which was luke warm when served. My seafood salad dish was acceptable but since it was close to $20, I expected bigger portions. We also had a sausage dish that was very highly rated in the guide books but I found it dry and ordinary (it tasted like something I could have just picked up at a Chinese food store and microwave). We spent over $80 for two adults and two kids and at the end of the meal, I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from the Food Channel and finally tried the place.  This restaurant is located in a poverished neighborhood with high crime rate based upon the sign on the door warning guests not to leave anything inside their vehicles. I was expecting food portions to be larger. Instead they were smalled to control portion size. 

The catfish was in portions cut up on the plate.  We ordered the drunken noodle not impressed with the lack of seafood i.e 2 mussels, no shimp and inexpesive frozen calamari. I have high expectations as eating at many Thai restaurants this would not be a place I would recommend to anyone unless you are not familiar with Thai food and don't have anything to compare to."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good Thai. 

Great service with full range of menu options. We shared the sea bass and some chicken plate that was fantastic.  You can dial up or down the heat as desired. 

If you are in the mood for thai.... This is It!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Vegas. Order from the northern Thai section on the menu. The cow soy is superb. Service was awesome. It's totally off the strip and the locals love it."}
{"text":"It's true. This has to be some of the best Thai food in Vegas.  It's all been said before, \"Located in what seems like a no man's land strip mall way off the strip\" but if you have the means it's a must stop to eat type place when visiting Vegas.  I didnt even really look at the menu since we arrived closer to closing and just ordered straight off of yelp suggestions: crispy rice, sea-bass drunken noodles, crispy duck, garlic prawns, seafood fried rice and steam rice.  After all that the bill for 3 people to our slight surprise was $100~ including tax and tip.
The food was really delicious though and I am looking forward to another visit.  I may not get the crispy rise though which was an interesting app but someone else in my party LOVED it?!  The crispy duck with curry reminded me of the filipino dish Kare-kare, which is a favorite of mine!  Everything else was so memorable and I can still recall the flavors from the great meal.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal especially off the strip.

Letie's review was great so I'll share the link again - http://what2eatz.blogspot.com/2011/12/lotus-of-siam.html"}
{"text":"Finally able to make it to Lotus of Siam to try the food. I made reservations for 3 people on a Saturday night at 8pm (took a few tries because the line was busy). We took a taxi from the Strip. We ordered our food medium hot and though everything was delicious, one dish was a disappointment.

Tom Kah Kai - The menu description listed straw mushrooms, we were disappointed when the soup arrived with regular button mushrooms. The chicken in the soup was dry from being in the soup too long. Minus one star.

Thum kah noon (pounded young jackfruit shredded) - We have never had jackfruit before. So this was a new dish for us. The meat was delicious with the rice. It would have made an awesome sloppy joe filling.

Nua Yum Katiem - Hidden spiciness in the cabbage in this dish. Mouth was burning, but we polished off the dish.

Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle - Delicious! The sea bass was deep fried and had great flavor.

The restaurant called a taxi after we finished dinner. A word of warning,  the location is off Strip, so it was impossible to get a taxi. We waited over 45 minutes for a taxi around 9:30pm. Minus one star. There were 3 other parties waiting outside for a taxi after us. We asked the restaurant to call again, and waited but still no taxis came (weekend of EDC). After watching cars cruise by slowly and contemplating hitching a ride with restaurant patrons, we decided to walk to the Stratosphere to catch a taxi back to our hotel and got to saw the real Vegas. Unfortunately/fortunately, it was super windy in Vegas with 30mph winds. This meant walking back in a sandstorm, but the wind kept us reasonably cool and the streets deserted. We were easily able to catch a taxi at the Stratosphere, and saw a long line of idling taxis there. 

I will probably go back again, but only if I have a car. I don't want to be risk being stranded again."}
{"text":"Please take the time to peel yourself away from the buffet, away from the strip, and come to Lotus of Siam. This will now be a must-eat for me when I come to Vegas. Believe the hype, it is incredible here.

Skip the stuff that sounds familiar; pad Thai, drunken noodles, etc. and go straight to the Northern Thai section of the menu. We ordered the Khao Soi which had egg noodles in a coconut cream curry base, beef, and pickled veggies. I wanted to dive into that broth it was so good and the noodles were the perfect texture. We also got the Northern Larb which was surprisingly light and spicy, lots of lime and pork. Lastly, we got Kang Ka Noon, the jackfruit curry. It was a nice balance to the other stuff we got, kind of a sweet-hot-sour flavor thing going on. It just sounded weird to us, so we had to try it. 

I highly recommend making a reservation, we would've been so hangry if we didn't do so. The wait was pretty long for those who walked in. The menu is so reasonably priced but tastes far more expensive. I'm not sure if I can eat Thai food anywhere else now!"}
{"text":"This place is sanity off the strip.  

Located in a strip mall cluster of Asian stores that look boarded up and whose names are hard to read, Lotus of Siam eluded me on the first attempt, but I'm glad I pursued it by way of a back street that revealed just how big this shopping center is.  This might help: it is right next door to Namaste Indian.  The restaurant is one of many that line a massive deserted parking lot that will make you think twice about getting out of your car, but inside the feeling was totally different.  

The servers were super friendly and helpful, and there were sane people there, sitting at tables, wearing clothes, on lunch breaks from office jobs or sober enough today to make it a few miles off the strip with cheerful faces, the ability to form coherent sentences, and the sense to seek out real food at reasonable prices.  What a relief!

I'm not a fan of buffet, and looking at this one didn't change my mind.  The selection was limited and the items looked like typical buffet food.  However, for those interested, the couple of main entrees looked decent and smelled good, and the $8.99 it costs seems more than fair.  

I opted for the menu and was completely satisfied.  Interestingly, they have a northern Thai food section, and I got the first dish listed.  It is an egg noodle dish served in a red coconut curry broth.  Even though it wasn't on the menu I was able to get tofu instead of chicken or beef.  The bowl of steaming sweet, spicy, sour, and creamy deliciousness is topped with cilantro, green onion, and a few fried noodles and served with a plate of \"sliced\" red onion, pickled cabbage, and a lime wedge.  The broth was absolutely delicious!  I savored each spoonful, and before I knew it had eaten the entire bowl.  It was the perfect portion for lunch.  

As for the garnish, the pickled cabbage had an interesting earthy taste underneath the vinegar, but I don't know what vegetable it was exactly.  The server thought it might be napa.  The only thing I would change would be the red onions which I think would have been much better if they were actually sliced rather than coarsely chopped as they were.  I love just about any vegetable ingredient, but huge chunks of raw onion are an exception.  

My general feeling for this place is gratitude and affection.  The food was excellent, the servers earnest, and the atmosphere perfect for decompressing from the chaos of the strip.  I would definitely come back if I happened through Vegas again, but then I might get too curious about the neighboring restaurants..."}
{"text":"Super delicious foods with the prices to match. The deep fried garlic prawns ($25) were crispy on the outside with the right touch of sweetness and garlic.  I literally devoured the whole prawns with shells, heads, gills and everything. They are that good.

We also ordered a 4-lb deep fried catfish ($40).  It was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and moist, flaky on the inside. It came with shredded salads topped with peanuts and prepared in a perfectly harmonious light fish sauce balanced with sweetness, acidity, heat, and saltiness. The sauce is so, so tasty I could literally eat white rice with just the sauce for a meal.

The pad thai was good.  We also ordered a soup (forgot what it was) but found it lacking in flavors and spices.  

The service was fast, friendly, attentive, and efficient.  The visit to LOS was a highlight of our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome food and quick service but the wait can get long. The price is also a lot pricier."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Las Vegas, but I would come back just to eat here.  Great wine list and as a vegan, so many options.  Staff is cross trained and excellent!!!"}
{"text":"The food really is outstanding at Lotus of Siam. The wine list is a tome. There are two drawbacks, though... it feels like a diner, and the waiting time for a table is LOOONG.

But when you go - you really should go - be sure to order the shredded jackfruit. It's a revelation."}
{"text":"TOM KA KAI!!! ! Thats for the Tom Ka Kizzle lovers that are glancing through these reviews because thats what I look for when I'm researching Thai fare while I'm looking to try new spots. With that said, my girlfriend and I love Thai and this place does not disappoint!! Usually I can't go one without having thai at least once a week and from my experience  there's 3 things that tell me right away if a place is going to separate itself from other Thai  spots- 
1. Soup  2. Noodle and 3. Curry's.. this is my first review here but my 2nd visit and as soon as I rolled into town to meet my girlfriend, Tom Kha Kai was calling me!!  Cashew nut chicken was excellent Curry Panang wonderful  and last but not least the Tom Ka Kai is my favorite!!  I always order medium spicy on everything when eating  Thai but Beware of the level of Hot/spicy  you ask for with the Panang  because the 5 really  got my attention..  Pad se ewe is great also!  The only downfall is no brown rice here and the wait for your food if its crowded. If you can get passed that then dont pass this place up, they brought us our Tom Ka Kai right away so the wait for the rest of our food didn't even matter.. ya can't rush quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great, cordial staff! If you need some help with the menu or just can't make up your mind because of the many options, just ask the waiter for some recommendations. Won't regret it!
On a little side note, some of the dishes might be a little spicier than expected, as we personally discovered. Of course not super spicy if marked as mild, but be careful if you don't stand spicy much.

Don't be fooled by the exterior or the bad, kinda scary area the place is in. The food will change your mind!


A last huge thank you to the waiter for surprising me with a birthday dessert!"}
{"text":"Turns out that \"spicy\" is a relative term. Be careful when ordering...

Great otherwise."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam how we heard so many things about you... 

We've heard many good things about this place that we had to try and also first time here..  Even at 9:30pm on Friday we had to wait a little and they close at 10!   Have I tried any other Thai place in Las Vegas?  No...  Is there a reason to?  Maybe not anymore...

The place is located in Winchester and what looks to be a shady location.  When we first walked in, we thought it was small a little hole in a wall place, until we were seated inside.  The inside is nice with a big wine wall rack glass display.  Shows you how un\"hole in a wall\" it really is.

So we tried the Coconut Milk Soup, Pad-See-Ew, House Fried Rice, and the Yellow Curry.  The dishes were good and we had no complaints with the food.  They also operate on a 1-10 spice scale, so you can spice to your liking...

The service is decent, maybe just a tad slow, but not like a turtle."}
{"text":"He says: Best Thai food I've had, for certain.  

They also have a great wine list, which worked out well because my sommelier friend was around to work with their sommelier to get the right pairings.  Hot Thai and cool wines?  Sign me up.

I loved my meal.  What we got:
* Tom yum shrimp: I ordered this spicy.  It was very spicy, just the way I like it (hotter than eating a jalapeno straight).  The flavors popped and the straw mushrooms soaked up the broth.
* Nam Prik Noom (Green Chili dip): Couldn't pass this up.  Tasty, but not all that spicy.  I'd definitely get it again.
* Red Curry Chicken: Delicious and spicy.  I was getting pretty full at this point, but I finished.

The wines were also great and pretty affordable.  Unfortunately, it's hard for me to remember the names of German wines but I assure you: they were good and I tried a few varietals I hadn't seen before.  I'd bet some people would find it worthwhile to go here for the wine list alone.

She says:  I was in a delicious food and wine coma -- I will add details as they come back to me.  The Tom Yum was sharp in all the right ways.   Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Amazing. You have no clue from the outside. Blacked out windows and a little \"open\" sign. You walk into a restaurant that is spacious and pumps out amazing food in copious quantities to maybe a hundred diners. Food is as good as it gets from a 12 page menu cooked by a Thai master. If you are in Vegas you have to try. Not inexpensive but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The food are excellent especially the duck curry  and galric prawns is a must try.   I definitely  will come back again."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Thai restaurant but my last visit only warranted 4 stars. 

Lotus of Siam has been a favorite for a long time.  It is a must visit for me whenever I am in Las Vegas.  The menu has good variety and the dishes are all flavorful and we'll prepared. My visit in October we had troubles getting the attention of the wait staff after receiving our food and the beef was chewy and a little dry.  The Tom Yum soup, pad Thai, and curries were as good as ever.  

I will definitely be back but hope to have the 5 star meal I am used too."}
{"text":"Really torn on 4 or 5 stars 
6 stars on food quality, 4 stars on service, 2 stars on location. 

Hands down some of the best Thai food.  Service is prompt when you have their attention but can be a bit scattered and location...well it is an adventure, but adds to the evening.  

tom yum kai soup, green curry, pad thai, garlic prawns, musaman curry...all great!  if you like the heat, 7 - 8 is just not that hot - go 9 to 10."}
{"text":"Ate here Monday 31st August 2015 and wow it was busy, we had to wait a little bit for a table so I can only imagine what a weekend would be like. There were 6 of us. The 5 other people I dined with are American and i'm British. I don't know if the U.S. is lacking in good Thai restaurants but this place for me was just 'good' despite previously being told by my American friends that this place is amazing/delicious/fantastic...

Half of us ordered chicken pad thai and the other half of us ordered green or yellow chicken thai curry. We had soup and spring rolls for starters. The food in my opinion was tasty, but nothing that excited my taste buds. The sauce for the curry was a little watery in my opinion and the spring rolls lacked in flavour. If I could give this restaurant 3.5 out of 5 I would as i'm teetering between giving 3 or 4 stars. The service was just ok, not as attentive as they could have been but not impossibly slow. I had a lovely evening but that was mainly more due to the company than the food. I do have to say though that the portions are very generously sized and the prices are reasonable. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here next time i'm in Vegas as cab fare is about $25 each way, not too bad if there's a group of you but if there's only you and one other then maybe not. I would only return IF I or someone I was travelling with had a strong craving for Thai food when in Vegas but other than that, I live in the North of England and there are tonnes of Thai restaurants in our city centres of Leeds & Manchester of which i've ate at many of them and have had much better Thai food back home in the U.K. This isn't the worst Thai restaurant i've been to, it's just okay/nice/pleasant.. nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Shady looking location, but the best Thai food I've had in my life. There's a reason there's a photos of Thomas Keller with the owner behind the cash register. There are a lot of traditional dishes that will keep me coming back until I try them all."}
{"text":"National Home Warranty -Las Vegas: Terrible service, don't keep their promises,contracting dishonest contractors, take time to get person on the phone, web page not easy to use, no response to emails.
 If there was rating (-)5 stars I would easily give it to them.
Can not recomend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've had thai food all over the world and this is as good as any there is.  Add a world class selection of wine and this is as sure a bet there is in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Friday, October 30th, 2015 we popped in for a late lunch around 330pm.  We were seated on the outdoor patio as request and the waiter assistant poured water as soon as we were seated.  Mitch, our server finally came by 12 minutes later to take our drink order.  My partner ordered the Watermelon Fresca which was awful!  Next we placed our order for the Chicken & Waffles and ShortRib Bologne.  Nothing special here. Just so so!  The Chicken was over cooked dry and chewy.  The pickles severed on top of the chicken were excellent.  The ShortRib Bologne was fair, once again nothing special.  But the real issue here is the pour service or lack there of!  If you have a choose, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best place in town. Everything is so good! It's always busy, and the decor isn't great- through its huge! I would totally stop here if your in Vegas and are craving Thai- take it from a local!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Great food and a fabulous wine list. Reasonable prices. Hard to get reservations"}
{"text":"Amazing food at the most unexpected hole in the wall. 

I had heard that Lotus of Siam was one of Vegas' hidden off-the-strip gems. Little did I know how much of a foodie-find it would be.

When my fiancé and I drove into the dark shopping center parking lot, the one place illuminated, was Lotus of Siam. We walked in and were cordially greeted. We were impressed by the large wine selection and even larger menu. This restaurant features not only your traditional Thai, but interesting cultural blends of Laos, Burmese, and northern Thai foods. 

Yes, you can order the traditional satay, pad thai, and curry. But why? We decided to be adventurous...even though we did order the satay with peanut sauce (to die for). We had some sort of sausage, a duck dish, a northern Thai stew (I specifically asked for the one without the blood in it...yes, they have some dishes with pork blood. I'm an adventurous eater, but not that adventurous. ), and a coconut soup that you just wanted to rub all over your body, it was so good.  I wish I could remember the names of what we had specifically. 

Lotus of Siam certainly lives up to it's reputation of awesome and adventurous food. We're definitely going back next time we're in Vegas. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in Vegas! Its off strip in an old part of town - surrounded by dive bars/pool halls and Korean BBQ.  Amazing wine list; casual place and a recent facelift for half of the restaurant.  Lunch can be a buffet or menu.  Great spice and  delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is over rated. If you are from cities with good foods, this place will disappoint you for sure.  We tried Garlic Shrimp, Fried rice, Pad thai, and they tasted all just an average.  The price is expensive too for what you get.  The other Thai restaurant in the commercial center has cheaper and better taste foods.  TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. THIS PLACE IS OVERRATED. DONT EXPECT TO BE AMAZED."}
{"text":"My most favorite restaurant in Vegas. Great service. Great food. Great staff. Reservations a must

The garlic prawns are awesome. Duck in Thai basil is super and all of the northern Thai selections are delicious. If you look online you can find reviews and suggestions from all the top chefs and food reviews. 

Rated the best Thai restaurant in North America.  Do yourself a favor. Don't order pad Thai as you can get that everywhere."}
{"text":"Ok.. first let me say.. I'm not big on spicy food so this probably isn't going to be a fair review for you spicy food lovers.  My husband and I visited this restaurant for lunch and missed the lunch crowd thank goodness!  We ordered the pork satay which I really liked,  drunken noodles with prawns.. good but I thought the prawns were overcooked so they were chewy and they were not clean.. nothing like seeing that black stripe!  My husband liked them... he did agree they were overcooked but he said they're deep fried.. no excuse.. and he loved the crispy shell.  The noodles were good but I thought a bit chopped and sticky .. maybe that is normal.  We also had the chicken pad thai noodles.. i know I know.. typical american dish no real thai lover would order ... now.. I understand it should be spicy and it probably is really good to you heat seekers but the not spicy version... tasted like noodles tossed in ketchup.  For desert we ordered the fried banana and coconut ice cream which were separate orders we had them combine.  They were good together but I'm not sure I would have liked the bananas without the ice cream.  Would I go back.. I think I would and maybe try the buffet... should you try it.. I think you should .. especially if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Came here thinking there is a 25% chance that I'd be disappointed because of all the hype and being from Oakland where there is so much bomb ass cheap Thai food.  Nope, 99% satisfied.  The 1% is portions are on the smaller side, especially given how expensive each dish was. 

On to food:
Crispy duck panang- no joke, this is absolutely ridiculously delicious! It isn't spicy and is a type of red curry.  Drizzle on rice and take a bite of the duck=heaven.

Crispy rice (nam kao tod)- so so so so so good.  Order your own, so good you don't want to share.  Perfect amount of spice and leaves a good citrus tang at the end of each bite

Drunken noodle with beef- I originally wanted the one with soft shell crab but they didn't have any on the night I went :(  The beef is pretty standard and so were the noodles.  Not that it was bad but since everything else was amazing, this is pretty standard

Tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton wrappers- pretty average.  I mean it's good cuz its a tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton but nothing unique.  I'd suggest saving space for the other better things.

Thai tea-  hard to mess this one up overall but pretty damn good.  The tea they used is brewed pretty strong and I can tell cuz it leaves the bitter tea after taste but that's how I like it

Tip: Make a reservation! Guaranteed during prime dinner time you'll wait 45-60min.  I called for reso a month ago and the convo went like this, \"I'd like to make reservations. We are all booked tonight! It's actually for next month. Ok, your name and number.  And don't be more than 5 min late or we give away your table!\"   This should show you that they are so popular that they DO NOT NEED YOU. 
Along with that, when I arrived, this is what happened, I walked in and said hi, immediate response was, it is an hour wait! ok but I have reservations....oh ok, wait here.  Then I was seated in 5 min.  

Lesson of the story, make a reso!  The line may be busy, keep trying and trying again, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  The reason for only 3 stars has to do with how they run the business (see last paragraph).  I've eaten Thai food all over the country - California, Oregon, Colorado, New York, Florida, etc and this by far is the best Thai food I have ever tasted.

Favorite dishes are of course the Chicken Pad Thai, Rad Na, and a soup I had with coconut milk, veggies, mushrooms, shrimp (forgot the name).  I ordered a beef type of salad last time and it was so fresh.  Love the little cucumber salad that is served with the Chicken Satay appetizers.  Thai BBQ chicken was very good - and the sweet and sour sauce that homes with it is homemade and delicious.

Get there as early as possible as there is always a wait.  You can make reservations, but not for the same day and they will only hold your table for 5 minutes so be on time.

My complaint is they should have some kind of voicemail that has their hours and not just let their phone ring and ring for people to guess.  I've also called during business hours and their phone isn't being answered (I'll call back several times and it just rings and rings).  Frustrating to call when I'm in town and I can't get through to make a reservation or place a take-out order."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Lotus several times per year for the last ten years and until this last week it had been my favorite restaurant in the world (been a lot of places, folks) and I would have rated it five stars plus.  I would often travel to Vegas just to eat there and once even flew in from in from a posting in Africa.  Since they have expanded into the wig shop next door, however, it seems that they care only about volume and not about custom made, tasty Thai food.  Last week I went for dinner my first night in town and ordered my favorite dish, their signature crispy rice with sour sausage.  I ordered it very got (8/10) like I normally do.  When it arrived it had no spice at all and was lukewarm.  It was obvious that they had made a large vat of it and were just slopping it out as if in a prison cafeteria.  The other dishes we ordered, panang curry and drunken noodles, were equally \"blah.\"

Since this was my favorite place in the world, I gave them another try.  I went for lunch a few days later figuring that since most people eat the lunch buffet I would be able to get a made to order crispy rice.  This time it wasn't even lukewarm.  I hope you're making some good money now, Lotus, because you're certainly not making good food anymore."}
{"text":"This place is literally as good as it gets! So good that you can look past the fact that it is like sahara desert hot inside. I LOVE air conditioning so the fact that there has never been any on...ever (we've been over a dozen times) and that we have literally sweated through tops in this place and I am STILL giving it 5 stars....go! Just go. It is worth the wait, often times poor reservation service and investment in deodorant. Just go.

YUM!

*Also heads up that the location isn't the safest in town."}
{"text":"Came here because everybody and their mamas know about this restaurant so being the sheep that I am, I followed lololol.

Anyways, we had the prawn tom yum soup (that's what you got there??? Yes, don't judge me!\") which was really good. Very authentic and the prawns really make this dish unique than other mom and pop Thai restaurants. Also ordered an off the menu lamb chop dish in a red/orange curry. Great dish and the sauce really complemented it well. Definitely a great first visit and one of the restaurants i would visit again to explore their menu. They have a very nice wine selection if your parlays and double downs hit at the casino.

Come here early though, there's a line before the restaurant even opens."}
{"text":"Really didnt like how this place looked from the outside, totally ate my words when I tried the food. I would say this is the best Thai place to eat in Vegas or at least one of the top 3. Its a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Red curry was,definitely my favorite had to wait roughly 30 minutes for a table no big deal the food was worth it kind of a formal setting feel to things was quite packed"}
{"text":"Not going to go through the blow by blow commentary on all our dishes as it has all been said here before. Both wings, chicken larb, garlic prawns, duck panang, beef khao soi, sea bass drunken noodles and basil chicken.  All superlative with best and most efficient service in Las Vegas.  LoS continues to hit on all cylinders and this lunch was no exception. Simply outstanding and a restaurant that everybody should go to."}
{"text":"Could be the best Thai restaurant in the country, there is a reason you need to make reservations way in advance.
  Everything I have had is the best i have eaten anywhere.
The drunken noddles are insane..
 The apps are great.
  This is the best you can get without gong to Thailand."}
{"text":"I have never been to Vegas and not eaten at this restaurant. Do not let the fact that it is in a strip mall scare you off! It is one of my all time favorite places.

Do not get the buffet! Don't get me wrong-everything on the buffet is good but the menu items are spectacular. Ordering off the menu is worth the wait! Ordering one of the Northern Thai menu items is a must. My friend ordered the ribs and they were heavenly. You can pass the time by choosing a wine from their incredible wine list. The service is friendly and attentive! By the way, they started taking AMEX again!! Yippee!"}
{"text":"I came Las Vegas for vacation. This is real thai food (you need to order 10 hot stars)."}
{"text":"Such great food! It is fresh, and so yummy! It is a must go to when in Vegas. 

Don't judge it by the outside, it is in a pretty crappy looking strip mall... but so worth it when you go inside!"}
{"text":"went for lunch since dinner is always packed...lunch buffet was nearly over but hostess kindly asked us if we wanted to do the lunch buffet. we decided to do a la carte though. crispy garlic shrimp, duck panong, and soft shell crab drunken noodles. each dish was roughly $20 but they were all the signature dishes, so not even mad about it at all. all of them were bomb. crispy shrimp literally tasted like chips just like the menu description says. so much flavor in that dish. can't handle spicy things too much since I'm japanese but didn't care that these were medium on spice, they were so good at that point it doesn't matter, just wipe the sweat out of my eyes and keep eating. one of the best things about lotus is the amazing wine list...like seriously tons of wines under $50 that are amazing. off strip and kinda in the lightweight ghetto i guess they don't kill ppl with prices. texted one of my go to wine guys and he picked a bomb bottle of riesling for $30 big ones. it was amazing, fresh fruit, crisp and light, perfect for spicy food. 

the only thing that kills me abut that place is the decor, like seriously rip up the 10 year old green stained carpet please!!!! put fake hardwood floor or re due the carpet please. it makes the room so dark and puts a downer on the experience. service was a little slow that day due to the room being busy but every one was apologetic and friendly, and thats all i need. not expecting 5 star service at this type of spot. 

so happy with lunch that day and def going back. heard about this place so many times and been here for 9 years, such a mistake not going way back when i heard about this spot. big menu so if you are going for the first time i would recommend the last 2 pages which is the chef selections. a little more $$ but totally worth it.

$30 bottle of riesling + 3 amazing entrees = a great start to a day..."}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic Thai/Laos food!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. With the long waits, you'd think the staff would get annoyed and rude, but on the contrary they always remain very friendly and professional. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with most reviews.  Lotus of Siam is a cult restaurant that definitely offers unique tastes but is not the best Thai in the country and may not even be the Thai in the Commercial Center.

By the way, although the Commercial Center is still an iffy place at night, a local business group has been trying to turn this around.

Some reviewers must be judging this by their uniqueness.  I can understand if someone is jaded, they will find this an adventure but quite frankly its not that great.  Their duck curry is too sweet and their spicy sausage dish is way too acidic.  It appears to have flecks of ham in it instead of sausage but only the taste not description matters.

I think that their abililty to pair wines with the food must account for some of their esteem by some food critics.  They do have a good selection and the husband of the chef is not bad at wine recommendations.  One of my friends in New York who was knocked on her heels by Michelin's star for Devi told me this is sometimes a factor.  

However, there are at least 2 Thai restaurants in Vegas that I am sure most would find superior to LOS:  Pin Kaow and Archi with Komol not far behind.  Komol is in the same seedy center as LOS.  

This review is not based on their buffet which is not as bad as most reviews but a definite step below their regular menu.  I have eaten there 3 times, exhortations from visitors driven and have always been underwhelmed.  

Yes, their flavorings are unique but is it good?  Is it as good as some of the other Thais in Las Vegas.  I'm sorry but no it is not."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. Tried the lobster and was over cooked therefore very dry. The squid salad was very fishy and the consistency chewy. The Tom yum soup was decent as was the crispy duck curry. Will not return."}
{"text":"Crispy duck and classic northern Thai dishes really set this place apart. If you enjoy going authentic but are new and are not sure what to order, just ask. The staff are great for noobs. I was only able to do lunch here, however it brought me directly back to both my vacations to Thailand."}
{"text":"tasty thai in vegas...worth the cab ride from the strip.

num nums: sea bass with papaya salad, spicy chicken wings, crispy rice, khao soi and coconut ice cream with sticky rice (add mango if it's around)"}
{"text":"Best Thai spot in Vegas. Must try the whole roasted catfish, soft shell crab salad, and the garlic shrimp with the shells. I've eaten here like 10 times, great everytime. Service is good. Too far from our house and they only stay open til about 9-930pm. This is Vegas stay open later. Please. And open a 2nd location don't like taking my kids to crack alley!"}
{"text":"Absolutely lived up to everything we were told. Make a reservation a week in advance if you know you're going to be in town. That way you walk right in to your table. Even our cab driver asked us what the deal was with this place because he'd been driving so many people there the last month or so.

Good wine list and quick service even though they were swamped. Some of the most amazing garlic shrimp I've ever had. They tone down on the spice if you don't ask them to kick it up, otherwise everything tasted fresh. We ordered all over the menu and nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place on the advice of Anthony Bourdain... It was not a disappointment !  Not a large amount of food but plenty and large on flavor.  Dishes are prepared from scratch. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Normally I would not write a Yelp review unless I've frequented the place at least two times, but the food was so good that I just have to give it 5 stars. I've been to Thailand and understand that it can be difficult to replicated flavors because it's not always easy to get fresh kaffir leaves, Thai basil, fresh coconut, etc. But everything we ordered here reminded me of Thailand! However, I can't speak for the Northern dishes because I've never been there, but everything I tried was heavenly. Can't wait to come back here! 

By the way, what other reviewers said about how the area is sketchy is true. Please Uber or taxi to and from for your safety."}
{"text":"i don't get why everyone seems to love this place. service is pretty slow and the food is just ok. the emphasis seems to be on volume over quality."}
{"text":"Awesome!
The location is shady. However, once you walk in, you are transformed into a new world.
Def worth trying."}
{"text":"Best Tai food in town. Very in expensive. Hard to get  a table. No ambiance whatsoever, but amazing food."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam

First off my preference at Thai restaurants is for a slightly thick sweet curry sauce. For the most part, I have based my rating on the curry dish. With that being said, on to my thoughts on Lotus of Siam. 
 
We started of with an appetizer of Shrimp wrapped with bacon wrapped in a won-ton wrap. This one has a nice bacon flavor, which doesn't always happen with bacon appetizers. I imagine if you ordered this to go the wrapper would suck but seeing as we ate it at the restaurant it was quite good as the wrapper was nice and crisp. It came with a light sweet and sour sauce which complemented it well. All in all a worthwhile appetizer. 4.5 out of 5

We ordered Yellow curry with pork (#4 on the spicy level). It was good but not great, like I said earlier I like my curry sauce a little bit thick and I like it to have a little more sweetness than this one had. Would I order it again? Probably, but that has more to do with really liking curry than really liking this dish. 3 out of 5

We also ordered the Crab fried rice. How do you describe good fried rice. I don't know but this is it. Slightly sweet, just the right amount of oil, this was an excellent dish. 5 out 5

Service - The service was ok, a little long waiting for someone to come with our check but U expect things like this with a busy restaurant that has reasonable prices. 3.5 out 5

Would we go back? Maybe, since we don't live in Vegas my guess is we would probably try something different next time since that is half the fun but you never know."}
{"text":"I rarely eat Thai food because the places I go to in L.A. either a) serve it too sweet by putting too much coconut milk or b) make it too spicy or hot that it destroys the taste. I almost decided to give up finding a decent Thai restaurant until 1 day driving to a relatives house in Las Vegas I stumbled to this place. Outside it does not look like much but inside it's wonderful and the food is to die for. For those that love Pad Thai go outside the box and try something different. I tried the Green Curry and love it. The prices are cheap and the food is first rate. Also I love their extensive wine list. Casual feel with excellent food make Lotus of Siam a must visit every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was no better than something one would cook at home.  I would say average.  The wait time was not great either given the quality of the food.  It felt like a fast food Thai cantine.  The bar only offered bottled options,  there were no cocktails or anything that would require effort to pepare."}
{"text":"One of the best and most authentic Thai restaurants I have visited. We were a big group of 6 and ordered a variety of selections and every dish was very flavorful and tasty. Ensure you order the right spice level since it can get up there. My wholehearted recommendation."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint.  It was worth the $20 (each way) cab ride from the strip.  Very friendly and knowledgable staff.  The service was fast, and the food was GREAT!  And wow, what a selection of Riesling!!!!"}
{"text":"long wait for a table. i went with my family and it took us about 30-45 minutes to get a table.

kind of a noisy place also not really a big fan of it. food is pretty good though i had the garlic prawns and pad thai"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai, nay the best oriental, food I've ever had (and I'm oriental).  If you go, make sure you get stuff off their northern thai menu.  I'm sure the other \"generic\" thai dishes are good but their specialties were out of this world.  Crispy duck that still boggles my mind how anyone can elevate duck to that level of tenderness with melt in your mouth skin.

Flavorsome curry and salads with all the five taste sensations in balance.  Portions are the best I've ever seen in any thai restaurant I've been to around the world, although I haven't been to Thailand to truly compare.  It might not be the best in the world but surely on this continent it has to rank at or near the top.

Judging from how full the restaurant was near closing time on a Sunday and the number of Thai people eating, they certainly are doing things right."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai restaurant if you are lucky enough to get a table. Get a reservation!  The service is prompt. The food quality is outstanding. The wine list is all encompassing. You will be amazed with the overall experience. A Vegas must do!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Some say it's the best in the USA and it would be hard to argue otherwise. Mind blown. Don't let the trashy 1970's communist Russian-style strip mall discourage you. Lotus of Siam is as good as any Thai food that I have ever had. I like my Thai food spicy and authentic and you can get both here is spades. The wait is long but worth it... prepare for at least 1 hour. Four of us ran up a tab of $250 with just a few beers and a good 15 dishes, we just couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here with a large party of 13. The server was very accomodating and made several suggestions. The garlic chicken wings were tasty. In general, it was an excellent meal and the price was right.  Perhaps not THE best Thai food in the country, but still quite enjoyable.  

I still put Thai Square in Arlington, VA as my #1 Thai restaurant in the country."}
{"text":"Lotus is about the best Thai food I've ever had. I go for lunch often with a friend, and we're never disappointed. We usually share a green papaya salad (which is out-of-this-world delicious!) and two entrees because both of us are light eaters. So the cost is extremely reasonable, but their lunch prices are very reasonable anyway. I've had chicken curry, ginger chicken, pad thai, drunken noodles, and several less common dishes that my friend recommended. I would get everyone of them again. The service is excellent, too. Honestly, I shouldn't even write this review since I think Lotus is one of LV's best kept lunch secrets. I don't want the place to get too crowded!"}
{"text":"Other than the wait, I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. They have my favorite panang curry to date. They also don't joke about spice. I usually order a 7 at most places to compensate for the lack of heat, but the certainly deliver so be cautious.

Make a reservation. Don't be in a hurry. This place is legit. :)"}
{"text":"Always try to come to this restaurant at least a couple of times each Vegas trip. Excellent dishes overall, especially the curries."}
{"text":"Service fabulous!  It was very busy and our server was consistently paying attention and taking care of us! Food was excellent.  I especially liked the tempura appetizer.  Overall wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected off-the-beaten-path treasure!! Definitely not what I expected but amazed & so delighted! Recommended by local co-workers...thank you! They said to try Crispy Duck Panang Curry & Garlic  Crispy Prawns. I ended up trying the Spicy Chicken Wings, Chicken Penang Curry & Beef Pad See Iew. I was not disappointed by the authenticity, polite service & delicious complexity of flavors!!
Probably the BEST Thai food I've ever had!!
Warning:
Location is probably not the best part of town & with a very unassuming store front in a dilapidated strip mall--I almost missed it. I'm glad I didn't.  Just come early when there's still light out when you leave.
Now I wish we had this in Chicago..."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a business trip and my co-worker had been here before and I love Thai, so we made a reservation and went. It was absolutely delicious (and FREE on the company!). We got Prawns in a Blanket-- absolute must-try!, Beef in Tamarind sauce (also great), green curry, and a rice dish (I forgot which one, unfortunately). Service was great, atmosphere was chatty, but not too loud where we were seated, and I was surprised at how affordable it all was, although it's worth splurging a little in order to try lots of different things. If I visit LV again, I will definitely come here again! Definitely need reservations, though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before, and was there again recently. It gets pretty packed, but for good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. There is an extensive menu ranging from vegetarian dishes to wild dishes such as trout, deer and even frog. Service is always great, but no 5 star since wait time to get seated is sometimes beyond long. Last time i waited over 2 hours to get seated...."}
{"text":"Super good Thai food. Comparable with Ruen Pair in Hollywood."}
{"text":"As you pull into the strip mall, you're not really sure what to expect!  But let me tell you that you're in for the surprise of your life.

The food was SO yummy!  Satay was delicious.  Bacon wrapped shrimp in a wonton wrapper.... how can you beat that?

The duck and seabass were both great.  And keep in mind that when they say spicy they mean it - an 8 is VERY SPICY.

What a great way to spend a dining experience... only 3/4 mile from Sahara.

Definitely something not to miss and worth the money.  Two for dinner with wine and two appy was abotu $ 100."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a hole in the wall, but this is the best Thai food in Vegas hands down. Try the wonton soup."}
{"text":"Truly the most AMAZING thai food you can get in America! My husband and I make trips to Vegas just for this food! 

Lotus of Siam is off the beaten path in Vegas but any concierge or taxi butler knows Lotus of Siam. I highly suggest you make a reservation, the restaurant is quit large since they expanded but the tables fill up quickly.

The atmosphere is nothing to write home about but the service and food is perfect. I would recommend getting a wine recommendation with your meal. They have quite an extensive list off Rieslings that perfectly compliment any thai meal.

Seriously EVERYTHING is amazing but I would make 1 special recommendation....it is not on the menu but they will make a fried sea bass in massaman curry that will blow your mind!

If you love thai food...please go here...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is one of the three best Thai restaurants I've eaten at in North America.  (I like all three so much I'll call it a tie, especially since they're so geographically distributed I can't eat at all three in a row without burning a ton of frequent flier miles.)

The first time I went, it felt weird.  It's in a strip mall, there was a bunch of broken window glass in the parking lot, and it felt kinda seedy.  But, the food.  Oh, the food.  I'd read that Gourmet magazine called it the best Thai restaurant in America, and I had sky-high expectations.

They were exceeded.

There's a neat twist, too.  In addition to all the dishes you think of as \"Thai\" (which are from the southern part of Thailand), they have a whole set of Northern Thai specialities.  If you think you know Thai food, only order from the part of the menu with the northern specialties.  It's Thai, but it's nothing you'll recognize unless you're really well traveled and know Thai food extremely well.

Eat. Here. Now.  If you say you don't like Thai food, eat here anyway.  If you don't like it here, then I will allow you to say you don't like Thai food -- but not until then!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Had a very helpful waitress who made some good suggestions and answered our questions. She asked how spicy we wanted it (we wanted spicy but not painful so we went with a 8 out of 10 and it was wonderful)

Recommend you make reservations. Excellent place and good prices to boot."}
{"text":"We decided to try it here because of all the great reviews but we were very disappointed. The waiter was courteous and attentive, not overly friendly, but just trying to get our order in and out as fast as possible in a nice way. He also recommended a great wine, which they do have a great collection of (reason why I'm not giving 1 star). This was not my issue at all, it was the food. We started with the fried wontons, which I found to be tasteless and with not enough filling. Then the Thai spring rolls, which instead of thin and crispy as usual, it was crispy but very doughy...not the typical Thai rolls. Then the main course, I ordered the red curry which to me was very bland and watered down. It was just missing something and had no taste other than spicy (I ordered a 5). It was also very small sized, I never eat my entire meals but did here...and not because it was too good I just had to keep eating. I left there with such a big craving for \"good\" Thai food I just had to eat Thai again today back in my hometown! I'm not sure what all the hype is about, but yes, there are definitely many way...way...way better Thai places out there!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas! Does not get any more flavorful, delicious than this!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I can say about Lotus of Siam that has not already been said. My one tip is that when they ask you what level of spice you want (1-10), subtract 3 from whatever you think you want. My husband and I love spicy food, but he was really shocked by the level of heat in the level-6 papaya salad. (As in, he had to excuse himself to get some fresh air before powering through and enjoying the other dishes.) There were a million things that we wanted to try, but we settled on these four, and managed to finish all four dishes between the two of us.

We enjoyed: 
* Papaya salad - As mentioned above, a 6 was very, very spicy. Worth it, though!
* Nam kao tod - Crispy rice appetizer with a uniquely sour taste. 
* Drunken noodles with soft shell crab - Flat noodles with fried soft shell crab.
* Panang curry with crispy duck - The creamy curry amazingly did not affect the crispiness of the duck skin. 

The service was excellent, and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Riesling with our meal. Very much worth the cab ride from the Strip."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas 2 times headed back in a fe weeks love going to eat here. Breakfast is cheap and Good.Bloody marys excellent. All there other food is great will eat there againand  i tell everyone about this place. AWESOME.FOR THE PRICE."}
{"text":"This place is a great Vegas adventure! If you want a change from $100+ per person meals on the strip, head to Lotus. It is a hole in the wall. as others have said. The food is outstanding, though. Take a group so you can try as many dishes as possible. Ask for Bill (chef's husband) to serve you. He knows his Thai cuisine and is passionate about wine."}
{"text":"Ambience is lacking inside and out  ... I pulled up in a cab to a deserted looking mall and wondered whether I wanted to keep my lunch reservation ... I'm glad I did.

I had the black pepper garlic chicken wings.  They were not greasy, yet crispy and flavorful.  I loved the salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub they put on the wings prior to frying.

The pork fried rice was initially just okay -- but after doctoring it up, it was great.  They initiallly got my order wrong, but even on the second try it was lacking in flavor so I asked for some of the spice rub for the wings and I mixed it in along with some of the thai bird chili and fish sauce (from the chili cart you need to ask for).  Pork is cut into  larger, thinish squares ... I prefer thicker and longer slices (typically a bit moister).

Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"FOOD= Average
STAFF= not too friendly 
PRICE= $$




Not all its hyped to be. The food is average if you aren't used to good Thai cooking then you might think this place is amazing.

Pad Thai is the best dish here very tasty and full of flavor.
Thai Papaya salad, don't order it here you will be disappointed. 
Egg Rolls, Average eggroll cant mess that up.
Drunken Noodle, noodles were old in both drunken noodle order so maybe we got a bad batch? Not sure but that was unpleasant. 

All in all if pad Thai is your favorite then come here because its delicious! Make a reservation this place is usually always busy."}
{"text":"It is an amazing Thai restaurant if you order the Northern Thai specialties. Don't get me wrong the other menu items are still very good such as their pad thai, but their brilliance shines on the northern food. Definitely the go to place in Las Vegas for amazing Thai food!"}
{"text":"All the food here is good. But do I think its the best thai food I have ever eaten? No. Overrated."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!  Ordered egg rolls, garlic prawns, sea bass on drunken noodle, and roasted duck curry.  Garlic prawns were the best part of the meal and definitely worth the price, wish there was more prawn rather than the shell.  Sea bass on drunken noodle was okay, so I was a little with the quality since it is on the expensive side.  Overall, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Just returned from a trip to vegas, and finally made it to Lotus of Siam!

First of all...the off-strip mall it's in is a little scary. Plenty of parking, though.

Next...even on an off-season Monday night, there was a line! Luckily it was only about a 10 minute wait for a table. Unfortunately, the service after sitting down was rrrrreeeeaaaaaallllllyyyyyy ssssslllllloooooowwwww.

Finally...the food was pretty good, although I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had. Tried the nam kao tod mainly because the reviews (posted on the wall) seemed to rave about it. Freaking salty!!! We ate the cabbage (which seemed to be a garnish?) with it to cut the salt. Then had the tom yum soup, which was tasty, although also somewhat salty. For entrees, the braised shortribs with panang was very good, especially with sticky rice. And I really liked the rad na. It's always one of my favorite dishes, and they did it quite well. The pad thai was my least favorite entree, being...meh. They made up for it with the coconut ice cream dessert, though. It was yum!

What can I say? I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"The food was really good!!! First time ever and I'd go again. Heads up call and make reservations because the wait is very long if you walk in, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food... I had the pleasure of having the seafood fried rice... the entree had just enough seafood and flavor...  I recommended everyone in Vegas hit this joint up if you want authentic Thai food!!! The best ever!!"}
{"text":"Just came back from there,  its in middle of no where,
So i wesnt sure how good off strip resturant might be.

So im getting in and first thing you see on thr walls are
All this celbrities...
And thr place is just packed!!!!
defintly  the best thai food i ever had in vegas!! 
You should add the egg on top of anything you take!
thats my tip."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for Thai food lovers! Recommend getting there early because wait times can get long. Don't let the location or the outside fool you, this place is a lot nicer on the inside. A lot of great authentic Thai dishes and able to accommodate food allergies. Definitely worth a try if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Now I understand that you may be tempted to abort mission when you see the area around Lotus of Siam, but that would be a huge mistake.  This place is amazing!  As far as Thai food goes, it has to be the best place I've ever tried.  I'm pretty sure the next step up requires a passport and a plane ticket to Bangkok.

Atmosphere wise, this place has the feel of a small mom and pop shop that grew and grew and eventually expanded to the layout they have now.  You still get that intimate feel, but with ample seating for large parties.  

When it comes to the food, you HAVE to start with the Nam Kao Tod, it's this crispy rice dish that is so unique and flavorful!  Next, you have to get some Tom Yum, which one exactly is up to you, but if you have at least 3 or 4 people, definitely get a hotpot, you'll being going back in for more!  After that, any combination of noodle, curry, bbq, rice, or northern dishes can't go wrong.  But if you're a seafood lover, get the garlic prawns!

They have an extensive wine list that you should take advantage of as well.  

One of the best aspects of this place is that they feature many items you cannot get at other local Thai restaurants, so DO try something new!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I always order Pad Thai. Today I was determined to do something different. Or as my boyfriend says, I was talked into doing something different! Anyways, we had the garlic prawns and the crispy duck that's everyone has talked up. Worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Thai place!! Everything in the menu is great.The staff here are all helpful and awesome. I don't think we have a bad experience with Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Wow!! Amazing food and service here! If only the place wasn't so out of the way! It's in such a deserted location from the strip. Wouldn't go there unless you have a car because we walked all the way from Fashion mall and Sahara Ave does not look safe to be walking through at night. 

Ordered Prawn in a Blanket, Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab, House Special Fried Rice and Mango Sticky Rice. They were ALL delicious!! They gave a lot more prawns than I expected for the appetizer and they were pretty good size prawns too. The noodles were very tasty but they were sure spicy as hell even though we asked for MEDIUM spicy!! On a scale of 1-10 it was more of an 8 and our mouths were practically on fire with each bite! I'm not a whimp for spicy food since I eat them pretty often but this place makes me wonder how hot can it be if someone ordered \"very spicy\". Their dishes are very decent sizes so we were so full at the end. Even the dessert was pretty huge! 

As for service, it was excellent! We got there at 6pm on a Monday and ordered a pretty expensive bottle of wine so not sure if that had any effect on the service we had. They were very attentive in terms of refilling the water and checking to see if everything was ok. In the end they even gave both of us a glass of dessert wine that was pretty good. My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I went to Lotus of Siam.  I returned and noticed that they had expanded since the last time I was here.  They were on a wait due to a holiday and they took our name.  They told us we would receive a text when our table was ready and that it would be held for 15 minutes.  Great!  We don't have to wait around, we can go do stuff.  So we did.  And headed back.  As we pulled in, (15 minutes before the quoted time), we got the text.  Our table was ready.

The place was bustling and was busy.  The servers worked together as a team.  I tried the garlic prawns after reading several reviews.  They were good and I ate the fried shells as instructed by the reviews.  Not bad.  But there were a lot of shells that didn't  have meat in them.  That was slightly disappointing.  

We were happy with the service, although had to request water refills several times.  Definitely a place to take Thai food lovers.  Not a place to take my mom.  Her idea of exotic eating is Panda Express.  (Ok, maybe not really).  But then again, she doesn't like cilantro."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice.  I lived in Thailand when I was a kid but am not a true Thai food aficionado.  My father is and he pronounced it excellent!  He wants to go back the next time he is town so that says a lot.  I thought the food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've only been here once.  I came here for dinner and enjoyed the dishes we ordered.  I absolutely loved their crab fried rice.  I am a fiend for crab fried rice.  I love the crab fried rice at OSHA Thai cafe on Geary Blvd in S.F. and ever since then, I have been ordering crab fried rice in every Thai restaurant that has the dish on their menu.  I hadn't found one that came close to OSHA's until Lotus of Siam.  It's better than OSHA!  Wow!  I never thought I'd be saying that.  Anyway, also had their papaya salad which was good, but we made the mistake of asking for 6 on their scale of 1-10 for spiciness.  The waiter said 4 was what most people ordered.  Well, I thought. I could handle spicy more than most people... well, I was dead wrong.  It was damn spicy!  So if you go here and they ask you for the scale... order 4!  Otherwise it's way too spicy.  I don't know if it was able to take less spicy this time because of the heat in Vegas... not sure if that had something to do with it.  But it was damn spicy.  Their deep fried pompano fish was pretty tasty as well.  Their sticky rice with mango was also very tasty.  The mango was very good.  

So I give it 4 stars because of their decor.  They could do so much more with the place.  It was very plain and ordinary.  I guess I've become used to Thai restaurants having more of a Thai decor and having more of a warm feeling while dining in the restaurants."}
{"text":"if you expect to eat here, make sure you come with a lot of patience.  This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant and I have been in restaurants all over the world. 
Let's start off with the wait; over an hour to be seated. Add an additional hour to get your food and finally when you do get your food, it's cold, but the waiter tells you, \"we serve all our food at room temperature\"...are you kidding me?
The portions are small but what's more is the horrible attitude of the wait staff. 
With all the amazing restaurants to eat in Vegas, save yourself a trip."}
{"text":"When my husband and I go to Vegas, it is a GUARANTEE that we will stop here for lunch before we check into our hotel. We seriously love this place. The food and service is just awesome. It's tricky to find as it's in a large strip mall, kind of in the back... it's hard to explain. We have trouble finding it every time we go, but it is still worth it. The vegetarian menu is amazing. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat whenever I travel to Vegas. I was just there a few days ago with my family & they loved every dish we picked off their menu with many varieties. The quality of their ingredients are always fresh & their food are very unique & flavourful. I find not many \"Asian\" restaurants in Vegas delivers the authenticity nor delicious flavours but this place is a hidden gem that lives up to my standards! I especially love their juicy satay skewers & green curry! (Drooling) The price is pretty reasonable for its deliciousness & in the city, however the portions are smaller than the usual Thai restaurants I go to. It is always packed especially on Fridays-Sundays, less waiting time to go during a weekday night! The outside looks very sketchy & the inside looks outdated, its decor consists of over 100 framed photos of famous people who ate there with a large display room of wine bottles. One of the things I wish they will improve on is providing free WiFi for its guests like most restaurants nowadays, especially when you have to wait over an hour for a table with no TV inside. You must check this place out if you're craving some Asian flare when you're in town! :)"}
{"text":"So this was the 3rd time I have been here, up until last night I had no complaint. We had a reservation and were seated very quickly (in a dark dingy back room) and with little conversation.  Great way to start off a birthday celebration. The soup and appetizer were good, the main dish which was a seafood of sorts in a broth was tasteless and lukewarm.  I ate it because I was hungry but was very dissatisfied and will not return again. Too many other good Thai places around town!"}
{"text":"They say that it's the best Thai in town. I agree!  The wait is long, but it is worth it.  The food and service are outstanding.  I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, we couldn't wait to try this place, but we were so disappointed.
It took forever to be seated and once we were seated, it took forever to get a waiter. Once we ordered, our appetizers came out on time, however, with our entrees we waited an hour! And they were cold. When we spoke with our server, he was rude and didn't offer to take back our entrees. 
Will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable.  If you like Thai food and you are anywhere near the strip it is worth the short drive over."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I do not understand the hype. The food was very mediocre. Glad I did not stand in line. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Garlic Fried Prawns is the greatest!

Excellent Tom Yom Soup.

Can't say enough about food.  Service is good.  Location not the greatest but you'll be back because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  Don't believe the hype of other reviewers.  It's located in old Vegas in a scary looking strip mall, but there's a cool wig store next door that you can browse at while waiting to get seated.

The food was okay.  Some dishes are better than others, but mostly it's a lot of fried foods.  Being spoiled with the best Thai on the West Coast in SF, Lotus of Siam doesn't compare.

There's an interesting looking buffet that they offer during the weekends (perhaps only on Sundays).

If you're looking for decent Thai food in Vegas, this is one of the few options.  It has somewhat of a beat up looking interior (most Thai places have a nice interior and are spotless) but there's always a buzzing crowd to make the place lively.  Prices were inflated for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I've eaten in alot of Thai restaurant in and outside L.A and Lotus of Siam is the best i've ever been in to...Whenever we go to Las Vegas we had to stop by atleast twice and try out their different thai cuisine...my fav is the Deep fried shrimp and Beef Panang... wish they have one in L.A:(

For all you food lover pls visit this spot whenever your in Vegas, you wont get disappointed!

{"text":"authentic Thai place and very decent food. a bit of overpriced and kind of over hyped by all the other reviews."}
{"text":"Is that Thai sausage in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? Oh! I'm so hoping it's Thai sausage. 

For my older brothers 45th birthday we came here with 15 friends who all met up at the Venetian. We had a couple of drinks at the hotel and made our way here. Happy and feeling dandy. And then it began.... course after course after course of some of the best Thai food I have ever savored.

We had several different salads. The banana blossom one was, are there words? No. I don't think there are. There wasn't a bad one in the bunch. Some were requested hot. And we got Thai hot. Which is blow  the top of your head off good.

We moved on to several soups which were amazing as well. I especially liked the shrimp with bok choy? I think it was bok choy. We drank enough wine to make me forget too much. (Damn you Mona! Take notes - but would I have been able to read them later?) Then came more.

Noodles. Beef, chicken, seafood, rice, curry and it just kept coming. It was a feast. And not a loser in the lot. 

By the time a fried banana desert came around, I was hailing a cab and hauling my butt back to the hotel. Enough. 

I plan on taking a large group of our clients here on our next Las Vegas outing. There's this one guy... who hates hot and spicy. I intend to kill him through food. Really, he has it coming. Meow."}
{"text":"We made a concerted effort to dine in this restaurant, due to all the high praise and feedback from patrons, as well as its \"appearance\" on Top Chef.  We made a reservation [quite late in the evening, but it worked with our schedule].  We were brimming with anticipation, driving to our fantastic dinner experience!

The location is in a strip mall, which is OK, as some fabulous gems are hidden away.  The entrance was quite tiny, and people had to rub shoulders to squeeze in or out of the restaurant.  We were seated in the large room, which resembled more  a cafeteria environment than a fine restaurant.  That was not what I envisioned.  We requested to be reseated, and were: in the front room, but at a table which was situated precisely between the 2 paths to and from the small dining annex , so there was a constant movement of diners and servers, non stop.  Fine, we settled down.

We ordered an appetizer of the Thai papaya salad, and spicy squid, along with a bottle of chilled white wine: Vermentino Litorale 2010 - crisp, \"snappy\", pungent.  But went so well with the spicy thai cusine. They DO have a fantastic wine selection: the \"cellar\" is housed behind a thick glass wall, so all can see the abundant wine offerings.  

The papaya salad was deceptively simple, yet very complex in flavors - a joy for the palate.  The squid salad was fabulously delicious, but extremely spicy: enjoy, but beware! I met my match in heat levels, and had to succumb to the help of thai tea with milk, to quench the inferno in my mouth.

For the main course, we selected pad ke mao with prawns, and crispy duck in cognac sauce.  My pad ke mao was awful!! The noodles were oily, hard and stuck together - clearly the dish sat a while under the heating lamps.  The prawns were absolutely bland, deep fried, and warm on the outside and cool in the center, from sitting too long.  I sent it back: it's an embarrassment to bring this quality of food to a diner!  They brought a fresh one: much better, but still missing the mark on prawn flavor.

The crispy duck dish was beautiful in presentation and taste: the crispy skin contrasted with succulent duck meat, surrounded by the delicious sauce with clear notes of coconut & peanut, and perfectly seasons for flavor and heat.  It was excellent, with the plain steamed rice.

For dessert we were dreaming of mango and sticky rice..... None to be had.  How disappointing.

Overall, this dining experience was a three out of four: the service felt rushed, and yet my first dish clearly sat for a long time before being served; the restaurant is extremely noisy - quite difficult to carry on a conversation at regular decibel level; lack of staple Thai dessert was very disappointing; and the seating arrangements leave a lot to be desired - at least for me."}
{"text":"Really good! Get the duck on curry it's a must!!! 

The price isn't that bad 

Just stick to what their known for you'll be good"}
{"text":"Went w/ a grp of friends. Had the standard Pad see ew & Pad thai. Both were averagely good. (nothing crazy about them).

Had NUA SAO RENU. number 56. Charbroiled beef with some tamarind sauce & dried pepper. Got it spicy, and it was pretty spicy. The meat & sauce was delishhh.

Also had the bbq pork, the meat was delish; presentation not so much. Was a plate with sliced pork."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around!!!! Pork Larb and Garlic Prawns were outstanding.  There was a little wait, but it was worth it. Waiter was very good and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place about a year ago, but didn't since we needed to catch an early show and didn't want to rush dinner.  Knowing that this place gets pretty busy during dinner time, one friend suggested that I call in to make a reservation.  I called and staff said all reservations were full, but walk-ins were welcome.  Okay, no reservation.  So either we go in for an early dinner (before 5:30) or a late dinner (after 7:30).  We decided on the late dinner.  And yeah, we ended up eating pretty late.  We got to the restaurant at 9:30, half an hour before it close.  When we walked into the restaurant I was surprised that there were still so many people there.  Besides us, there were even people waiting to be seated.  I thought that with it being almost closing time, restaurant would be pretty empty.

We waited for about 5 minutes before we got seated.  We got to sit at a bigger table so there's plenty of room.  The staffs were friendly and efficient.  Our food orders came out quickly.  

fried tofu (bean curd) -- nicely fried tofu with cabbage strips on the bottom and a side of plum sauce.  The tofu was crispy on the outside and silky on the inside.  I like it a lot.  

roasted duck curry -- the flavor was good.  You get pieces of roasted duck with pineapple pieces and the usual veggies.  Not too spicy.  Good for people who like some heat but don't want to start sweating from it.   But for people who like extra spicy food or who wants to sweat, I think you can probably ask them to make it more spicy.  Entree comes with a side of rice.    

garlic shrimp -- jumbo plump shrimps deep fried with the shell on.  The shrimps were butterflied before frying so it's so crispy that you can actually eat the shell .  The flavor was on point.  If you like you can dip it in plum sauce, but there's enough flavor where you didn't have to.  I enjoyed this dish.

pad se eww -- Nice flavor, well cooked, and not overly greasy.  The flat noodle was cooked just right so that it's not dry.  The noodle did not stick together.  The vegetable was tender.  Liked it.    

This is a nice restaurant to eat at.  I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and the food here is simply amazing!!! I can't get enough of this place but it is always packed and I hate the wait but it's totally worth it.  They have a very nice bar so that's where I make my time go by...the longer the wait the more I drink...lol...I guess that's what they want since everyone spends more on drinks than on the meal itself.  Very authentic.  I like pad se ew and tom yum koong and my friend loves the coconut shrimp and curry.  Whatever we like they have....i'm in heaven every time I come here to eat.  Definitely the best thai place in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Lotus of Siam was absolutely delicious. This was my first visit, but I'm already looking forward to eating here the next time I come to Vegas.

My favorite dish was Koong Char Num Plar: raw prawns served with lime, chili paste,  garlic slice, mint leaf, & a flavorful fish sauce. It was a simple dish with well balanced, complex flavors. 

I also ordered fried fish cakes (appetizer), panang (curry), and a jack fruit dish with fish (northern). For dessert I had fried banana & coconut ice cream. The bananas were wrapped in a sheet which reminded me of fried egg rolls; it was tasty and different than expected."}
{"text":"Can Lotus of Siam be summed up? Can it be leveled by a few words? You'd be hard pressed. Try criticizing the best Thai meal of your life, one that you paid less for than almost every Thai dinner you've ever had. 

Completely unpretentious, despite an incredible Riesling selection and the most robust and spicy Thai flavors you'll ever come across. Make sure to order Yam Nua, the grilled steak salad with mint and chili.

I am still speechless after my meal, the flavors lingering on my tongue and beckoning me to move to Las Vegas so I can eat here more often. Well, no meal can drive you that far."}
{"text":"The food was great and price was RIGHT! I was brought here on a lunch date. Checked out Yelp first, and due to customer comments....decided to order the Drunken Noodles with seafood. THANK YOU FELLOW YELPERS!!!!! It was spot on! Seafood was tasty, noodles were delicious and squishy and the sauce was yummy. My date got the coconut milk soup and ate/drank every last sip. The whole meal was 24 bucks.... they could charge more, but glad they dont! I will definitly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a nice dinner here tonight. Probably one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I highly recommend the crispy duck panang and garlic prawns...so tasty!!! 

Service was also exceptional. Only downside was the price, a bit on pricey for the small portions. 

Overall I would return try more dishes."}
{"text":"Came here with somewhat high expectations considering the reviews and pictures of famous people on the wall.

Extremely good food.  I have Thai food many other places but this was one of the best ones I've had.  I had the duck with drunken noodle and some garlic friend shrimp.  Both I recommend.  I wish they had a location back in my state, I would go frequently.

If you are visiting Las Vegas, I highly recommend trying this place out for a meal at the very least.  It is located in a somewhat seedy looking strip mall but don't judge a book by it's cover."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Drunken Noodle. No wonder why so many people go here. Excellent!"}
{"text":"THE FOOD HERE IS DELICIOUS. You must have a reservation and do not be late because you will lose your spot.  If you do not have a reservation the line to get in is ridiculously long and you might not get a table. The staff is extremely attentive and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't get it.
Average food at best.  Insanely large menu and confusing,

I am not sure where all of the five star reviews come from.  

We introduced ourselves to the hostess/waitress for a party of two and we were told thirty minutes.  That's ok, I understand, but after waiting in the tiny lobby in the way off all incoming and outgoing traffic we were seated.  While walking to our table i noticed a large bar area that we could have enjoyed a drink while waiting.  She never mentioned it to us and we could not see it from where we were waiting.

The first turn off was the size of the menu. (over 100 items) Any time I see menus with multiple pages I know there is no way any kitchen can keep that many items in house, fresh and cooked properly.

We ordered fried won tons and tom kha gai soup for starters.  The won tons were nice but the soup was thin, broken and separated oil lie on the surface.  not sure if it were overheated or on a steam table too long???

Our entrees were pineapple duck curry and seared scallops.  After 10 minutes the waiter (nice guy) informed me the kitchen was out of scallops.  I ordered red curry as a substitute. Both dishes were ok,  nothing memorable but hot and served with steamed rice.  I have no negatives about the entrees but considering all of the reviews i was hoping for WOW.  

to sum up the negatives; 
hostess process
buss tubs being used at the tables
buss carts and dirty dishes line the tight hallway to the restrooms.
pan handlers in the parking lot.

All together I would try it again, maybe for lunch, but if it is a repeat of our dinner i do not see a reason to go back.  There are a lot of Thai restaurants without all the hype and with equal or better food"}
{"text":"This place by itself is worth the drive to Vegas. It is simply the best Thai food around, certainly the best I have ever had. They are specialists in a number of Thai dishes you will not find anywhere else so don't sell yourself short by just ordering the pad Thai. The crispy duck Curry is the best duck dish I have ever had in any restaurant hands-down. This place is constantly great, had terrific service and is very clean. Don't let the location in the average looking strip mall fool you."}
{"text":"When a restaurant - that is in Las Vegas - NOT on the strip and is NOT flashy at all - have over 2000 reviews .. it say a lot about the place!!! ... And yes I was NOT disappointed ..

One of the BEST Thai food I have had in the US ... excellent service and very affordable. The chef and owner used to be a chef for the King of Thailand - a fact that becomes more evident when you taste the food!

Their menu has more variety of Thai food than the number of beers listed in NYC's celebrated Beer bars! - some stand out items - NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice), Deep fried whole red snapper topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil, satay, Prawn Garlic Thai style .. etc.. 

So the bottom-line is - If you are in Vegas - skip the madness of the strip and try food here ... its worth the trip!

IMPORANT: DO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A TABLE RESERVED WELLLLL IN ADVANCE !!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, but very expensive! I think it is because of all the publicity. It's a bit steep in price to be a regular for me, but I do like to come here once in a while. The fried fish dishes are really tasty. The pad thai is not dry, and the perfect amount of sweet and salty. When people visit from out of town, this is a good place to bring them. I would recommend Lotus of Siam for special occasions and to entertain guests."}
{"text":"Yum. Loved everything. So good and very reasonable, price wise! Will eat here again every time I'm in Vegas. The garlic prawns and crispy duck Penang are my favorite! Great wine list too."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner several times and never been dissapointed. Good food and service."}
{"text":"It use to be much better years ago when I fist experience their food. For the last few years it has not met the standards. I have lived in Thailand and had numerous combinations of Thai food and sorry Lotus you are not close. Once you taste the real good Thai food you will know what flavor is."}
{"text":"Driving up you'll wonder if you need a bulletproof vest. I took some colleagues here and one of them ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees for all 7. It was fantastic. Very tasty and fun. Try the chai tea. Yum."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Western Hemisphere. It is smaller than you might imagine and in a shady looking strip mall but the food makes up for it.

Here's my tip-
The chef is from Northern Thailand and special items from that area are indicated on the menu. Select some of those dishes. I prefer the Northern Larb for example over the standard larb.

Be adventurous and stay away from chicken satay, pad thai and penang beef. You can get that anywhere.

Oh, reservations are recommended but if it's a weeknight and early, head over and get on the list. They have a wine bar in the back that where you can wait. Wine selection is quite nice too! Lots of German varieties."}
{"text":"The best Tia Restaurant anywhere! Hands down perfect!  The only down sides are location a seedie mall east of the strip, make sure you have reservations as the line out side is long and we have seen the wait be in the 1-2 hours.  I've eaten there so many times that I can't tell you what to order. I've had so many different dishes and each one perfect! When in Vegas go there if you like Tia food and see how it is suppose to be!"}
{"text":"Been going to lotus of siam (sahara rd) for a long time. It was our first time at this new location and the new place looks amazing. Whats not amazing is the service. I ordered pad tai with peanuts on the side, they literally put the peanuts on the edge of the plate. I didn't want it touching the food cause my kids are allergic. Our waitress took it back and took forever to get the new one. We ordered 7 dishes and the increments of when the dishes were serve were long. They forgot our steamed rice and had to ask twice and we just finally gave up on the steamed rice...it never came. Just ate our dishes with the fried rice we ordered instead.  Food was still good but service was horrible. I can truly say one of the worst service I've ever experienced in a while. Each dish took a long time to be served."}
{"text":"Exceeded the hype. Extraordinary ingredients prepared with authenticity and passion. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good service but mediocre food. After reading all the rave yelp reviews about this place, I was really looking forward to trying out some of their classic dishes -- garlic prawns and crispy duck -- but the food turned out nothing special: it was merely comparable to other neighborhood Thai restaurants yet came with a higher price tag (hence two stars instead of three). I guess they are relying on one-time customers for their business.

That said, I somewhat appreciated their Bangkok-style soup which has an interesting, complex flavor thanks to the combination of coconut milk, mushrooms, and lemongrass.

Overall, if you are looking for a reservation-worthy experience, I would recommend to look elsewhere...

Edit: two days after I wrote my review, I received a comment full of insults. I sincerely hope this was a display of an inspired following of this restaurant (in that case, I am happy they found a place where they like to eat) rather than a regular business practice."}
{"text":"I've been to Lotus of Siam twice, both times with a friend from out of town who insists on going since it's his favorite restaurant in Vegas. I had heard good things from other people as well but had never gone because it's not particularly close to where I live. I'm happy to report that it lived up to expectations and is certainly worth the drive.

Both times, I got Sea Bass. The first time, I got Sea Bass on Drunken Noodles which has a chili and Thai basil sauce. Second time, I got Sea Bass Som Thum, which is over a papaya salad. In both cases, the fish was cooked perfectly and the sauces were tasty but nice and light and didn't overwhelm the fish.

Lotus of Siam has an extensive wine menu. We had the same waiter both times, and he was very well-versed in the selection and guided us to an excellent pairing on both occasions."}
{"text":"Totally the worst place to order take out !!! 
The little guy said it only takes 20 mins... But in reality it tooks one hour! He keep saying \"it's coming.. It's coming...\" Many many times and I got sick of it !!!
The best thing that we want to cancel it and he refused to do it!! And again, he said \"It's coming... \" Wth? He said sorry, but he even didn't look at me... Like he didn't care at all... Grrr...That little guy no attitude at all..
Gratz Lotus of Siam is the worst place I ever met !!!
I know you are a very very famous restaurant, that's why you think only for an unimportant person like me, you don't need to give the best service, coz you still have millions of customers....
I got it now... !!! That's it... No more ordering in this place again... ZZzzz"}
{"text":"The entrance to this hole-in-the-wall restaurant is lined with reviews, review after review from food critics I've actually heard of, crowning it the Best Thai Food in Las Vegas, in the West, in the Country, in the World, in the Universe.  We had dinner and I was a bit disappointed, though it was okay.

Then I went back and had the lunch buffet, which was universally panned and despised by Yelpers.  I actually thought it was really good and by far the best meal for under $10 that I had in Vegas.

Behold the Awesome Power of Raised/Lowered Expectations!

Dinner: The nam-kao-tod (crispy rice) was a very interesting blend of flavors and I'd have it again.  The kang-ka-noon (spicy young jack fruit curry) was unremarkable, and the catfish was just okay.  Service was up and down; the wait staff were friendly when they were there, but sometimes they seemed to forget about us.

Lunch Buffet: The banana rolls were delicious and were really what won me over.  The garlic pepper chicken and the curry puffs were also good.  Staples such as pad thai were also present."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I write this two star review of one of my favorite restaurants, Lotus of Siam.

My wife and I frequent Las Vegas and have had dozens of dinners at LOS, often bringing friends and relatives along.  Last Tuesday, unfortunately, was a letdown.  Something had changed since we were last there this winter.  We were a party of eight, very well behaved, and were ushered to the back room, no big deal.

What happened next was the \"Vegas Hustle\" by our waitress, who aggressively pushed high-ticket menu items on us.  This was something new, ordinarily, we have received very polite service here, however, you are in Vegas so we/I just blew it off.

The food, the food , THAT is the problem, LOS's food has shrunk! I thought \"Are we giants?\"  The Nam Prik Ong was the size of a thimble for God's sake!  The Papaya Salad was also incredibly tiny!  Even the prawns in the Garlic Prawns were smaller!  

So to sum it up, prices are up and portions are w-a-a-a-y down!

P.S. Be nice to the guy in the parking lot looking for handouts.  He knows which car you came out of."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked up a to go order a couple of days ago.. I give this place two stars because the spicy wings were good... Other than that, I don't get what the fuzz is about. I expected really really good food but everything else we ordered was pretty mediocre. We ordered a spicy soup that wasn't spicy (we were asked how spicy on a scale of 1-10 and said 8), chicken chow mein that hardly had any bean sprouts, spicy beef with a sauce that was just watery, and they forgot our cucumber salad orders. The saddest thing is that the portions are really small. If that's the standard, then that's ok, but don't charge an arm and a leg for mediocre food. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Only had take out from this place a few times and by far it's the best Thai food I've ever had. Drunken anything on the menu is a must try. 

If you love Thai, there's more Thai than you can handle and I'm not talking about Thai girls or any ladyboys."}
{"text":"When we arrived at the restaurant it looked like a run down building with a few people standing outside. We were shocked when we went opened the door. The inside of the restaurant is actually nice and it was super packed. The wait for a table of 3 took 1 hour. Luckily we were able to leave and come back in an hour. It was definitely worth the wait. The food here is amazing! The best things we ordered were the Garlic prawns and the soft shelled crab salad. Next time I go to Vegas I will make sure I come back to eat those 2 amazing dishes."}
{"text":"A decent Thai restaurant off the strip.  The  decor was sparse, the wait staff pre-occupied,  the portions were modist and the prices on the high side for Thai.  We had Pad Thai, a Duck curry that tasted wonderful and a Northern Thai dish that was simple but nice."}

We were a party of 9 and asked our server to bring several bottles of Riesling, 4-6 appetizers and 6-8 main entrees - all chef's choice. Nearly all were fantastic. There was a catfish dish that seemed to be overcooked but the crispy rice appetizer, a delectable beef dish, garlic prawns and the soft shell crab salad were divine. 

Loved it! I plan to return again and again!"}
{"text":"During a business trip in Vegas one of our friends highly recommended this place. It was a 15 minutes cab ride from the strip. Looks nothing from the outside and humble inside. We waited for almost an hour on a Thur evening. 7 of us ordered at least 10 items. Each dish was pure perfection. Outstanding food."}
{"text":"Perhaps Chef Saipin Chutima who is also a James Beard Award winner was MIA the day we went.

The food is over-rated based mainly on the ridiculous prices.  

The garlic shrimp was OK but slightly overcooked.

The roasted duck curry was skimpy on the duck - considering the price?  Highway robbery!

If I lived nearby would I return?  Never!

3 entrees and tip?  100 bucks!  This is not a \"family\" place - it's a triple D/best thing I ever ate  over-rated tourist trap IMO."}
{"text":"Lotus is a breath of fresh air in a sea of over-hyped, over-priced pretentious restaurants here in Las Vegas.

The ingredients are fresh and appropriate to the style.  Dishes are properly prepared and done quickly given the fact that the restaurant is always crowded.  They will adjust the level of \"heat\" to your liking to the best of their ability although some dishes have no choice but to be somewhat spicy due to the pre-prepared sauces used in their preparation. 

They also have a remarkable wine list for a restaurant of this genre.  There are several Grand Cru Bordeaux choices with a range of vintages as well as all the usual suspects.  But, it IS Las Vegas :D

Yes, you have to plan ahead if you want to eat here.  People begin lining up out front more than half an hour befor opening time so don't be surprised if you're told an hour or longer for a walk-in.  Even though it is located in a decrepit strip mall you otherwise wouldn't give a second glance, everyone knows how good the food is and acts accordingly."}
{"text":"Ok so after my first walk in experience that did not go well I told my self why not give it another try . So I went in there and the girl was really nice she took me to the table then another guy ask me what I wanted to drink and he was polite as well , then my waiter came after 14 minutes and the place was slow not even that busy I was ok with that though since  I was not in a hurry .. He goes are you ready with a rude kind of tone I'm in a hurry way .. When I told him I wanted the soup he told me that's to big for you but again not in a nice way I felt so rushed while I was ordering ....any who then I try to order vegetarian noodles and I ask what my options are so he goes tofu and vegetables so I told him  I'll take that and with a very rude tone again he replies well which one it will be vegetables or tofu I thought they went together sorry don't punch me lol !! Any ways so the soup came out and there was a great amount of shrimp but the soup tasted like vinegar I was like ew !! He went 3 times around all the tables asking how is everything tastes except me I was so sad .. I felt like is there something wrong with me ?? Any ways the noodles were good but boring .. Over all I was expecting sooooooooo much more of this place and to be honest ones the service is not good it  makes everything worst .. I'm sure people love this place and have a great experience !! Mine happen to suck and I had wayyyy better Thai food in other places I swear !! I'm a food lover and I'll tell you it's nothing special just another Thai food place that word of mouth made it famous that's all !! Ps: great parking but over all I will never go back again unless I was there for a birthday party invitation and I had no choice !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There's no chance I'll go to Vegas without eating here during my stay. This place has ruined my taste for cheap Thai food back home in Denver (sorry Thai Basil). I am starting to salivate at the very notion of their pad thai. When I visit I feel like I'm a part of a secret society that knows about this place and we might be asked for the special password at our next visit. It's hidden in a not-so-nice strip mall behind the Vegas strip but it's quite lovely inside: the thai spice aroma lifts me off my feet as I float to the table and begin contemplating what new adventure I will offer my mouth with this next order."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Wow! Best Thai I have ever eaten. I wish I would have pictures but 'Plar' whole fish, Satay, and Tom Ka Kai soup were phenomenal! I will come back next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"If I ate at Lotus of Siam 4 times over a 4 day trip to Vegas...does that qualify me as an addict? Or just a regular on Yelp?

Flying in Friday night from Newark, I search Yelp and online and find good reviews of Lotus of Siam, calling it one of the best Thai restaurants in the US. I'm a huge fan of Thai (like Somtum Der, Pam Real Thai and others in NYC) and decided to try it.

That first dinner was so good that next night, searching for healthier restaurants not far from the Strip, I decided it was easier to just go to Lotus of Siam again.

Over 4 visits (3x for dinner and once for lunch), I tried:

ENTREES
- Northern Larb. Think minced pork with chilis that explodes with flavor, whether you choose a spiciness level closer to 1 or 10. This was the only dish I ordered twice in my 4 visits. Be warned though, if you're not much for hot/spicy, choose a lower number.
- Nam Prik Ong (Red chili dip). While I saw this dish mentioned in reviews, I wasn't too impressed. It's tasty, just not as much so as the Northern Larb.
- Khao Soi. This was like a large bowl of flat egg noodles mixed with curry. Tasty but I preferred other dishes mixed with rice.
- Kang Hung Lay (beef stew). Paired with rice, this dish was good. Fairly flavorful.
- Isan sausages. This is Thai sausage sliced and served with a bunch of raw veggies (onions, Thai chili peppers, cabbage, etc). A good appetizer to share with friends (Though being hungry, I ordered this along with an entree for myself).
- Pad kraprow with pork belly and minced chicken. This is usually my go-to dish at Thai restaurants (generally preferring rice to noodles) but in this case I waited a few visits to try this. If you like minced meat with basil and chilis, you'll probably like this. 

DRINK
- A variety of different German Reislings. I haven't traditionally been into wine but admit I'm now sold on pairing them with Thai food.
- Also Thai iced tea once to see what it was like. Par for the course, not mind-blowingly different.

SUMMARY
I liked this Thai restaurant so much I ate there 4 times over a 4-day visit. If you like delicious Thai food paired with wine and sake, it's hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Located in a nondescript, strip mall, this restaurant has to be the best place for Thai food in all of Las Vegas, if not the country. And if you are looking for an incredible wine selection, look no further. Wow. From the rare, hard to find Bordeaux to your favorite California Zin - this place will have it! Family owned and run with a casual, homey ambiance, this restaurant allows you to focus on the food and wine - just as it should be!"}
{"text":"Finally made the pilgrimage to Lotus and was it worth it!  The food is spectacular, the service was very friendly and helpful, and can we talk about the riesling selection on the wine list?  Absolutely one of the best meals/experiences I've had in a very long time.  If you are in LV you MUST make a trip to Lotus."}
{"text":"Lotus is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas. The food here is reasonably priced and never disappoints!  

I highly recommend the garlic prawn if you want to win people over. Lotus is also famous for their curries which I can't get enough of! I love that they'll do special orders- I take that to mean all the food is cooked fresh in their kitchen. 

For dessert, I love their coconut ice cream with sticky rice.

The service is good despite being overwhelmed with customers on most evenings. Make a reservation for weekend nights (which you have to do 24 hours in advance).

Meeting some panhandlers during the walk in is just a part of the Lotus experience now. So is the cafeteria-style seating and the slighlty strange decor.

That being said, the awards that this restaurant has gotten are well deserved. For my friends who visit town, I always consider Lotus a must-do stop. 

The only thing I could ask for is that this place would open for lunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"lots better Thai restaurants than this place. cant believe its a national rated place. took me a while to figure out why the deep fried veggies were light pink, Palm oil"}
{"text":"They used to be the only place that had a lunch buffet. I want them to bring it back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious; I can't stop thinking about the crispy fried rice. Service was good also. My only gripe was that they serve beer & wine only :) I got past it quickly once I tasted the food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai food, but we did not love Lotus of Siam.  
The waiter was nice - until he realized that we weren't ordering wine.  After that he only came by to take our order and drop off the food. We had to ask for refills on the water, and they waiter didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  The party next to us ordered tons of alcohol, and maybe that was the reason for such poor service.
My husband loves Tod Mun, but said this was the worst he had ever tasted. The portions were also small, especially for the prices they were charging.  We had a curry dish that we asked to be spicy, but it was just bland.  We also tried a couple other unmemborable dishes.  What a disappointment.  
That aside, the lunch buffet sounds better, and maybe we should have tried that first."}
{"text":"Softest pad see ew noodles I've ever had. That's weird but if you have theirs you'll understand... 
You spend about $3 more on your fav Thai dishes but it really is all so delicious!"}
{"text":"Garlic prawns,Thai basil crispy pork and seafood fried rice...so delicious.  It is off the beaten path but worth the drive."}
{"text":"The service does accompany the high quality of the cooking. You can always get a smile out of the waiter. Thankfully the manager and hostess, a  charming woman, is always around willing to exchange some kind words with all her clients.
The spicy foods feels like in hell but extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Love the Food, Great Service, Moderate Prices. Do not be turned off by the Dicey looking shopping center, it will be worth it. From Very Authentic to the Beginner in Thai food, this place has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great food, service and value. Norther Thai food. The chili heat was controlled very well. The flavors in our dishes were excellent. The service was awesome. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates Thai food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, so many options it's hard to even begin.
Everything we tried was fantastic, don't think you can really go wrong."}
{"text":"Not only one of the best Thai restaurants, but one of the best restaurants I have been to.  The chicken wings were hands down the best ever!    Amazing.   I could eat the garlic spice mix they use by the spoonful!   The only downside is the service is pretty much non-existant or very poor.   Beef up your service and you will have the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Have heard of this restaurant being one of the best thai restaurants in the country, so I was really glad that when I was in Vegas I had a chance to go there. The restaurant was hard to find. Like most places in Vegas that is off the strip, this place is in a sketchy part of town in a very run down strip mall. But people in the know have no problem finding the place. We were lucky to come on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait for a table. The menu is extensive. There are so many things that sound so good and I wish I could try everything. I really had a hard time choosing so I asked the waiter for recommendations. He was extremely nice and really helpful. With his help, we ordered the drunken noodles with prawns and a pork curry that had some Burmese influences. The drunken noodle dish was mind blowing. The noodles were topped with giant prawns, I think there was 7 or 8. The prawns were huge! And it was deep fried and they separate the shell enough so it is easy to eat the shrimp but still intact enough to make it look like a butterfly. Great presentation. The deep fried shell tastes like shrimp chips, so yummy! The prawns are very tender. There's so much of this stuff that the noodles are dwarfed in comparison. The noodles were also really tasty. It would have been fine if this was a stand alone dish. I don't think I have had drunken noodles this good. The pork curry was also really distinctive. The spices are very rich and unexpected. The pork was tender and flavorful. This is not your typical thai restaurant or typical Americanized thai food. Really great experience. There has been comparisons with this and Kin Khao in SF. I can tell the flavors are of the same region, and I can see the similarities. However, I think Lotus takes the prize, if not for its no nonsense simplicity vs KK's over fancified SF style presentation. Just purely on experience since Lotus has been around for so much longer."}
{"text":"Spoiled rotten with my first time eating Thai food.

From the outside, you will say \"wow, really? This is what people are raving about?\" in a sarcastic tone.  When you get your food, you will say, \"wow, really! This what people are raving about!\" enthusiastically.

I am a very pedestrian eater when it comes to ethnic food. I don't like spicy, I don't like weird things.  So I was dreading my visit.  I was expecting to like 1 or 2 of the 10 things we ordered, in reality, there were only 2 of the 10 things I did NOT like (the spicy things)!

Since I do not have a baseline, I will just say everything was great, so from a picky ethnic eater, here was what stood out:

Mee Krob - interesting.  Just thought South Park made this word up.
Sea bass with Drunken Noodle - waiter recommendation over another sea bass pairing.
Crispy Duck with Panang - another waiter audible. Was spicy, but a great taste.
Pad Thai - again, interesting my unrefined palette
Mango Sweet Rice combined with Coconut Ice Cream - never had mango before, this was a treat! Definitely a great closer. Mango is only served in season. Wait for it.

Finally, the Thai Iced Tea was really cool.  Warning, do not let this water down in the ice, it will destroy the epic flavor.

By now, you should be reading this from the restaurant.  Just go!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food period. We ordered the lobster, and pad se ew. Not our usual garlic shrimp which is also to die for.  I have not had a bad meal at this one of a kind joint. The waiters and waitress are very attentive. It seems like they are happy to serve you great food."}
{"text":"this place is so well hidden, i fully agree when reviewers believe that it is the locals hide this gem from the prying eyes of tourists.

The moment you step in, you realise why this place is so popular! the decor is beautiful, the wine cellar is impressive and the servers extremely friendly.

We had phad thai, green curry and some soup which was a mix of coconut milk and spicy tom yum like soup. The first and last dish were above average. I have been eating thai food since I was a kid and coming from Asia, the meal here is pretty authentic. what stood out the most was the amazing green curry! It is as good as the best I have eaten in thailand! 

the dessert of mango and sticky rice with coconut ice cream was above average. 

For excellent, authentic thai food, this place is a MUST TRY! :) prices are extremely affordable too! :)h"}
{"text":"Over 1200 reviews and oh my my...yuck is all I can say.  With all of the great reviews, James Beard nomination and all of the celebrity pictures on the wall, we walked into a really sad looking resturant with high hopes.  Ordered 3 dishes which all came out disappointing.  $18 for their special seafood dish...2 shrimps, a few piecs of frozen fake crab and some frozen mussels.  What is this crap? Are you serious? The beef panang was also a sad plate of I dont know what.  $60 and 3 dishes later, I enjoyed my 117 degrees heat outside better than my meal here."}
{"text":"About a week ago I was looking for a non-buffet place with affordable prices close to the Strip and thanks to yelp tried out this gem. It turned out to be the best Thai food I have had in the US. I started out with some Satay, which was juicy and well seasoned and even included a delicious sweet cucumber salad. My entree was a pork stew, which wasn't hot, yet still filled to the brink with spices. I would absolutely recommend getting the sticky rice with it. I also had a couple of spoons of Tom Yum Koong soup, and it was delicious but way too hot for me, probably the hottest one I have ever had, felt like a wildfire was building up in my mouth. If you like hot food though, you should give it a try. I was too full to get dessert, however I had some nice green tea that was done exactly right, so I left Lotus of Siam smiling happily and am planning to return next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Had the panang crispy duck and tried a little bit of the dishes that the rest of our group had and didn't find one that I didn't like. This was our 3rd time there and always great. Be sure to make reservations because they always seem to be very busy."}
{"text":"What a great experience!

The restaurant is located in a shady shopping complex and the exterior is as low key as you could imagine. However once inside there is no hesitation that atmosphere is excellent.

The staff was very friendly and willing to answer questions about the dishes to anyone who needs it.

Food was awesome and plate licking good!

Will be going back ASAP"}
{"text":"Well what can I say !? Just Absolutely Fantastic. What to eat? order what you know or try something new, you simply can not go wrong."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Try the Northern Thai menu...it's very different from typical Thai fare. 

Great Service. Convenient Location, even if you need to take a cab. 

Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas and perhaps the country. Very deep wine cellar specializing in German wines (Rieslings) which pair perfectly with the spicy Thai food. The staff is very competent, efficient and helpful. Go for the Northern Thai specialties in the back of the menu like crispy duck Penang and soft shell crab drunken noodles. Be sure to make reservations if you want to eat here. It is a very popular restaurant located off the strip."}
{"text":"Best Northern Thai cuisine I've ever had. With a wine list that reads more like a laundry list of must-haves rather a simple selection of accompanying beverages and a menu that could be a manuscript of all things delicious; Lotus is a must-have both the local resident and the discerning out-of-towner."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick seafood soup, tom yum, I think it's called.
The broth was just too bland compared to the ones I've had at 
Krung Thai and Pin Kaow.  It was like water and it had a weird aftertaste."}
{"text":"We eat Thai food all over the country as we're traveling. We've been eating here for over 10 years.The food is still excellent and the service is as well. We had a bump this time. I called on Thursday for reservations on Saturday night at 6 o'clock but when we arrived there was no reservation on their books. (Still not sure if that was their mixup or mine. Make sure when you call that they take your first and last name.) 

They worked us in as fast as they could, which ended up being about 20 minutes. It is difficult, sometimes, to get through to even make a reservation, but it is WORHT IT! 

We had garlic prawns, crispy duck with drunken noodles, Larb from the Northern Menu and a sliced beef in coconut dish from the Chef's Choice menu - all four dishes were excellent. Don't miss the coconut ice cream on hot sticky rice. 

Lotus of Siam is still a favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible food with worst service ever. Partial order food was cold and others did not come after 1:30 hrs waiting...!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I make an attempt to stop by at least once to get the Crispy Duck Penang.  It's really a good dish.  They do have a large selection on their menu.  I've tried their squid salad (love it), one of the laap (good), garlic shrimps (tasty), pineapple fried rice (okay) and pad Thai (too mushy).  I think it's best to avoid the menu item that you would see see at standard Thai places like the pad Thai and fried rice.  The others items are excellent."}
{"text":"Five stars all around for this fine establishment. The appearance may be tricky at first, but don't judge a book by its cover. This hidden gem, In a plaza on the outskirts of the Las Vegas strip has some of the most delectable, mouthwatering Thai food in the country. From their amazing Pad Thai, to the crispy chicken wings, the curry duck and there amazing wine selection. lotus of Siam is a meal you won't want to miss. 

PS. Get there early at lunch time to make sure you get a table. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great service! Definitely going back when I go back to Vegas next time. Won't regret!! Who knew you would get such an authentic and delicious Thai in Vegas?!?! Garlic shrimp, Tom yum koong, crispy duck curry and khao soi were my favorites."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has changed their dining menu.  Be careful when you order the brisket.  Instead of the nice lean slices of brisket that you use to get, now you get about three slices of brisket (no longer cooked with sauce on it) on top of shredded brisket full of fat which looks like it was long on the bottom of the pot.  Definitely not worth the money you pay for it.  I did confirm with the management that the menu has been changed to the unsavory item mentioned above.  What use to be a great dish and well worth the money, is now a glob of fatty shredded tiny pieces of brisket taken from the bottom of the pot with a few pieces of brisket on top, no longer cooked with the delicious sauce that use to give it such a good flavor, and no longer worth the money.

So disappointed.  However if you want good Bar B Que from a great place that isn't trying to pinch pennies go to John Mull's Road Kill Grill.  You will get your money's worth there."}
{"text":"Wow, the best Thai food I have outside Thailand. Well worth the effort to get there. A word of caution, be conservative with the spice. The papaya salad blew mouth away. The sea bass was magnificent. Let the waiter steer you. Also it was very reasonable priced.
My wife can't stop talking about it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Thai places that I have ate.  Some other top contenders are New Krung Thai Restaurant in San Jose and Osha in San Francisco.  

On the outside, this place looks real plain, nothing fancy, expecting a no ac and dirty kind of place.  But once you walk in, you see this nice temperature controlled wine cellar.  Then you see how large the restaurant actually is and that it is packed with people.  We made a reservation about 2 hrs in advance and had no problems getting it.  Once we arrived, they honored the reservation and led us immediately to our table.  I hate the places where you make a reservation, but still have to wait like everybody else.

We got the spicy catfish with basil, crispy duck in panang sauce, Tod Mun Pla (deep fried fish-cak), and Tom Yum Kun soup.  We got everything medium, oh also, everything came in exactly as medium for me, its not one of those places where medium means, low to zero spicy.

The Tod Mun Pla was great, I love the spicy sauce with cucumbers that came with it.
Tom Yum Kun soup was good, but was actually a little spicy for me.
The spicy fried catfish was real tasty and it stayed crispy till the end, I was expecting it to get soggy later on in the meal, but it stayed crispy.  
The crispy duck was also great, the only part of the duck that was crispy though was the skin.  It came with a panang sauce, which was good, we put that over our rice.  The duck was a little pricey though, about $21, was expecting it to be a whole duck, but was probably only half a duck.  But was still worth getting it.

Overall, if I am in Vegas and feeling like eating Thai, I would come here."}
{"text":"James Beard-approved, world class Thai food. Go early to avoid the inevitable crowd and wait for your table at the bar. I suggest a cold sake to get you started. Everything is fantastic. I especially love the yellow curry and the pork-filled fried chicken appetizer. Take my word for it - just order it. And they serve a delicious, nutty brown rice on request. I look forward to dinner here every time I go to Vegas. Good for large parties, too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the same 3 dishes: garlic prawns, pad sew ew and their pineapple duck curry. They are a must try! 

There always seems to be a line so be sure to get there right when it opens!"}
{"text":"The worst Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. Doesn't know how to talk to customer. Everyone is very rude. Food quality is way below the average and quantity is very small...do no to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant I've ever went to the food was Absolutley delicious you must try the garlic shrimp  and the service was great"}
{"text":"Came here 3 times during a recent trip to vegas! It's off the strip and about a $20 cab ride.  If you're with a group, the cab ride here is absolutely worth it! The place gets packed!! It's not an undiscovered gem anymore. So, reservations are a MUST.  They apparently have expanded and done some remodeling so the space is quite big.  There is a pretty extensive wine selection here, which totally surprised me for a place located in a strip mall.  Friends have said the neighborhood is not the best.  

As for the food, WOW!  A huge selection of thai dishes.  The curries, pad siew and soups are all great.  Be careful of the papaya salad, tell them that u want it not spicy or mild b/c it is VERY spicy, but Oh so good!  On our last night in vegas, we ordered the lobster special and it was delicious!!  Super flavorful and sweet.  They also have great coconut ice cream here, with real pieces of coconut.   

If you live in Vegas, or are visiting, go to Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"Best food outside of Thailand... if you are in Vegas go there!!! Have been here a couple times and never lets me down.  Make sure to make a reservation though as the wait can be very long!"}
{"text":"We did have high expectation's due to the Yelp reviews but it didn't meet our expectations at all. We will keep our business at Ping Kao."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the building or the surrounding ghost town of a strip mall fool you...go through the door and find possibly the best Thai in Vegas. 

Ok so I generally keep things very simple when trying new Thai places and these guys blew away my expectations. A buddy told me about this place a year ago and unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try it so last week I made it a point to stop in, and so glad I did. 

In keeping it simple I went for spicy vegetable soup and Pad Thai. Both of these dishes were fantastic, with a big peppery bite in the Thai hot Spicy Vegetable Soup, and the Pad Thai was so flavorful, best I've had in Vegas hands down. 

The place looks like a dive but swing in it's well worth it, lunch on weekdays things were quite so that might be your chance to beat the dinner rush that others have mentioned...worked out perfect for me."}
{"text":"Came here on the Friday after T-day and were seated in about 3 minutes with no reservations (we arrived about 8:45).  Very easy to find - lots of parking in the rear.  The area is sketchtastic - be prepared.

LOS served the best drunken noodles we have EVER had!  You must order the beef jerky type of app.  It was delicious and something that you could easily become addicted to.  I'm dropping a star b/c the host recommended a level 4 on the northern thai larb dish and it was just tooooooo spicy!  Also, the service after we were seated was a little spotty.

Will def go back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive.  We ordered garlic prawn & whole red snapper w/ basil sauce.  The shrimp plate is looking good, but closer look half of them are skin.  The red snapper is the smallest red snapper I've seen, and I don't think it was red snapper at all; base on its texture & size, it's more like tilapia.  We're still hungry after $70 meal (for 2 dishes).  I don't think it's worth the price for the environment & taste.  I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever come back again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from here but the food was so good I'll still give it 2 stars.  It was tasty enough that I'd even consider going back again despite the painful and unpleasant 36 post-dinner hours.

The prices are super reasonable.  Even with the cost of a round trip cab ride you'll save money over eating dinner on the strip.  Also, when they say spicy they mean it.  It was perfect for me but some things were too much for my wife.  She can usually hang too."}
{"text":"Squid salad and seabass on papaya salad. YUM!"}
{"text":"It is a 5-star for the money. We have been dining there for years. So worth the 20 min drive.
You can thank Sarah Schiffman next time you see her, as she tells everyone how great you are.
AND she is a foodie from Portland OR too; where great restaurants are on every corner."}
{"text":"We came here because we were stopping through LV and my dad recently hopped onto the Anthony Bourdain hypetrain. Therefore, whatever AB says is good, we try. 
If you want to come and you're from out of town, definitely reserve a week or at least a few days prior. You will not regret it. Service was great though we still waited 20 minutes to get a table set up. Not a big deal, since it was 7 o'clock and clearly the dinner rush. 

We ordered Nam Kao Tod, Khao Soi, Mango and Sticky Rice, Red Pork Curry, and the Young Jackfruit Salad. People urged us to order from the Northern Thai Menu and avoid ordering stuff like Pad Thai. 
I didn't really know what to expect because I had never had these dishes before, but the Nam Kao Tod and the Jackfruit definitely stood out to me. I was also really hungry and we ordered such a vast variety of stuff I think I forgot how to appropriately savor my food and kind of put everything into my face hole. Oops. The Khao Soi is delicious too, it's kind of like a red coconut curry with noodles in it. It didn't wow me, but it was still very good. 

I kind of wish I did get typical Thai fare like Pad Thai/Rad Na or whatever and compare it to the stuff I usually get in San Diego/Portland, but I'm glad we explored N. Thai cuisine! 

Thanks AB."}
{"text":"we chose this restaurant because it was rated the #1 Thai restaurant on Yelp and it was recommended by people we know who actually live in Vegas.  

we heard about the long line to get in so we decided to call and make a reservation for the very same day.  they said they were all booked for reservations but the wait shouldn't be that long....so we just planned on driving to the restaurant and hoping for the best.  we went on a Thursday (today) and were in the parking lot at 5:15 (doors open at 5:30).  there was already a small line forming, 3 parties ahead of us.  by the time the doors opened, there was about 30 people in line.  we don't normally eat this early but didn't want to miss our chance at getting seated sooner than later.  we were seated right away (party of 2) :)  

yes, the reviews are true, it's looks like a hole in the wall on the outside but once inside you will be immediately relieved.  hey, any restaurant that has a line of people outside waiting to get in has to be good, right? right!

we ordered 2 appetizers: garlic/black pepper chicken wings and the tom yum kai soup (cup size).  wouldn't get the wings again because they weren't garlicky or peppery enough for us but they had a good crunchiness to them.  the soup was fantastic, i got it # 5 in spiciness and it definitely had a kick.  our 4 mains included: pad thai (chicken), we both agreed it was the best pad thai ever.  thai fried rice (chicken), we both agreed it was a little bland for fried rice and would not order it again.  green curry w/chicken, it was very, very good and would certainly order it again.  garlic prawns that everyone raves about (i don't eat prawns but i made my husband order them) and he thought they were awesome, although a little pricey (21.95). 

we did not order any alcohol or dessert.  our bill came to about $68.00 before tip.  needless to say, we had leftovers to bring with us.

the service was friendly and FAST.  the waiters were very attentive at refilling our water glasses and clearing away our plates.  

this restaurant is definitely worth it.  the reason why i am only giving it 4/5 is because we thought the food could have been a little hotter (temperature wise).

Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"Like others, I came here expecting the best thai food in the country after seeing it on bourdain. I even ordered only northern Thai dishes, supposedly their specialty. The homemade sausage was okay, but everything else was very disappointing. This place is all hype. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was hyped up quite a bit, but it didn't disappoint. Hole in the wall for sure, but it's nice inside and the food transcends the environment the second it arrives. I got the Khao Soi with Crispy duck and it was incredible, savory, creamy curry and duck with the fat perfectly crispy with super moist meat. Can't recommend this place highly enough, just don't expect them to split your bill more than three ways."}
{"text":"This place is extremely popular so if you're coming from out of town you have to make reservations 2-3 weeks in advance and a couple months early if you want your first pick on a weekend or Friday.  I saw the raving reviews here and with all the celebrities they have posters on the wall you'd think it was the best Thai food outside of Thailand.  

I ordered a cup of Tom Yum Kai and found the chicken to be dry.  The taste was good and light so I suppose that was a plus.  My husband and I decided to order our usual at all Thai restaurants to do a comparison: Panang Curry with chicken and Phad Se-ew with beef.  The panang curry had to have been the worst I've had.  It had only the flavor of coconut milk with no real flavor of curry, dry chicken again and only sliced red peppers.  Did someone forget to add curry powder in it?  The Phad Se-ew was pretty good but still had it better in Manhattan with more flavor. 

Customer service wasn't the greatest either.  The waiter didn't come to our table for a good 15-20 minutes and it took him awhile to bring our check after we were done eating.  Never checked on us while we ate.  Maybe we didn't order their signature shrimp dish but these other normal offerings should've been stellar if it is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam got off on the wrong foot with their call confirming our reservation in which they threatened to give away our reservation if we were more than five minutes late.  I know it's a popular spot but calm down.

Admittedly the food was tasty. The larb and sea bass with Suki sauce had the right amount of heat.  Even the more basic pad see ew was well made.  But our night out lasted less than an hour as food was delivered too quickly to enjoy the meal overall.

There are a lot of Thai and Asian options in Las Vegas.  Choose another like Chada Thai for a better experience."}
{"text":"Close, but no 5 stars. But really it was!

Last weekend I was in Vegas and our second (and last) night there, we wanted to eat out for dinner again. Again I eyed the local restaurants on yelp and this actually was my second choice. We actually tried to go to this Italian place, but the area was just creeeepy. FAIL. Lol so we let the GPS take us to Lotus of Siam.

I didn't know what to expect because I've been to many Thai places and I only really like a couple. I'm really picky about little aspects of food, but I wanted to be open-minded, especially because my stomach was empty =(. So the wait was 10 minutes, which went by pretty quick! My parents were surprised to find the place PACKED, but we snagged a table at the right time.

We were seated in the mini dining rooms on the side and it was pretty cozy. But more importantly, I wanted some real good food. We ordered:

Pad Thai - Not the best I've tasted, and personally was a little small and a little dry. But pretty good.

Spicy Fried Rice - What the hell?! No one asked how spicy we wanted it?! This shit burned our stomachs and my thai iced tea was goooone. I love spicy food but they were literally trying to start a fire in my throat. Tasty nonetheless!

Chili Mussels - Pretty good, but I'm not too big on mussels. My dad liked it though.

Musaman Curry - The tastiest curry ever. We got it with tofu and it was really good. I was bummed the bowl was so small.

Service was pretty good too, so that of course is a plus. But because I'm real picky about my food (well at least when I went there), it didn't get the 5 stars I was really hoping to give. Great place though, and from the looks of it this place is loved by many. If I'm in Vegas again, I'll definitely come by again. And I'll be prepared for the fried rice!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I'm not kidding they have the best shrimp and have the best coconut soup with chicken oh my gosh they have Thai salads there amazing everything is just amazing on that place everything has  good flavor like nothing leaves you out they had like this duck in curry ,chicken or something like that and it was amazing I love it so much please try this place five full stars!!"}
{"text":"Came back here again about 2 1/2 years later. Had pretty much the same stuff. This time saved room for dessert. The fried bananas combined with coconut ice cream is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Overhyped!!! Overpriced!!!  Food was kinda cold and the BBQ chicken was pink inside. \"Raw\". The worst part is that the servings are too small. For being the best Thai food in Vegas, it's pretty weak. The service is not that bad though."}
{"text":"This place is really good BUT not the best Thai food in Vegas. The chili dip on the Northern menu is amazing, but there is another Thai place in the same plaza who's flavor profiles are a lot better... starts with a K ends with an L"}
{"text":"Tried it because of all the good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. I got there 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a line of about 8 people (3 groups). The outside is beat up, but the interior is nice. It's a high class restaurant in the middle of a strip mall. I don't remember anything after the garlic prawns. I blacked out they were so good. A bit more expensive than I expected but it was very good quality.."}
{"text":"Put the buffet plate down... step away from the counter and move off the strip for a bit.  OK so it's not that far off the strip and yes if you drive down Sahara you'll see the restaurant front and you may just pass by and say forget it.  That was my SO's reaction as we drove by, but trust me stop find parking in this run down strip mall, brave the characters outside, look straight ahead and go in the restaurant.  

We ordered two dishes, I just wished we were with a bigger party so that we could have tried more dishes.  I ordered the braised short ribs... love me tender, tender meat!!!  And the SO ordered the pork stew northern curry.  Both were lovely the Pork stew had a good bite, a bit spicier that I would like but I still enjoyed it.  It was a bit odd that the waiter didn't ask how hot we wanted it but to me that's sometimes a good sing of a great restaurant.  I like it we a chef prepares a dish how it should be enjoyed no matter who's taste bud is eating it.  The best part of the pork stew dish was that the pork pieces had just a bit of fat yup pork fat in it.  I know it's bad for you and also know that a lot of people hate the texture/taste of it, but what can I say, I'm filipino and we just love that stuff.  
We also ordered the sticky rice and mango... big mistake as this push us over the top and almost exploded as I made my way out of the restaurant.  I don't know if it was just the fact that I was too full but the desert did not really impress me too much.  Pretty standard sticky rice/mango one can find in other good Thai place.
I would give this place 5 stars if not for the location.  Great food nice space inside very reasonable prices.  A must when you want really good food and not willing to pay the price associated with a \"celebrity chef's\" name plastered on a restaurant.  So pass the buffet line and go straight to LOS."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one place to eat at each time I'm in Vegas, it would have to be Lotus. Although it is off the strip, it's absolutely worth the trip. Every dish I've had here has not disappointed. I love the garlic prawns, crying tiger and chicken satay. I would suggest calling ahead to make a reservation or you'll have a long wait."}
{"text":"We could not wait for 1hr so we did take out.  It was more than fantastic!!!! Will be here again tomorrow too. :-)  Shrimp fry and fried rice was awesome."}
{"text":"This place was overall GREAT! I am in Vegas for a trade show and was recommended this place by my boss who had heard of it. Five of us shared a few appetizers and main dishes. We had a little bit of everything: soup, dumping, fried rice, pad thai, etc. A cool thing is they ask you how spicy you want it, so you can choose if you like it real spicy or not spicy at all. The waiters, even the hosts, really know their food. If you ask, they will recommend the best, and it truly is the best. I did visit their ladies restroom and I was very surprised to see a fabulously clean and well groomed restroom. Soap, toilet paper..everything was stocked. When you see the outside of the restaurant, you wouldn't necessarily think it was nice on the inside, but everything on the inside was professional including the waiters and hosts. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in town."}
{"text":"This place is over rated..so is their crispy garlic shrimp for which they charge $27 with about 8 prawns and shells attached together..deep fried. Very greasy and not flavorful! The fried rice we ordered was very small in portion and about $15. Either they need to increase the portions or decrease the price. Also, they add a gratuity 18% regardless of the number in your party. Overall mediocre."}
{"text":"The food was delicious only when it was served hot. I ordered the drunken noodle with crispy duck but it was not served hot. the noodle was soggy and it looked like it was a left over from yesterday.... when complained, our server took it and brought us back a warmer food, which was much better. overall food was ok, not great enough  to rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the atmosphere was far better than you would think based on the location. 

We had a bunch of classics and they were all excellent. The tom ka gai was tangy and spicy and flavorful. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it. We also had the beef salad which was great. The beef was grilled and came in thicker slices than I'm used to and you could really enjoy the grilled flavor of the beef. We also had the short ribs in Penang curry-awesome. Beef was so tender and falling apart which is just how I like my slow cooked shot ribs. Lots of delicious curry. And we had sea bass on drunken noodles. The noodles were smokey and flavorful on their own. Pad Thai was delicious but you know, pad Thai can only ever be so good  

I was not expecting much from the location, but it is surprisingly large and bustling inside with a friendly staff and comfortable surroundings. Not very fancy but this is not a dive or hole in the wall. 

My friends and all agree that we will definitely come back when we are next in Vegas.  But we will make reservations"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a stunning surprise in a city built on either shockingly cheap or shockingly expensive.  Lotus is very good with reasonable prices.  Located in a very random strip mall and (according to our cab driver) dangerous neighborhood, Lotus is a great surprise for out-of-town visitors.  

While the reputation of this restaurant precedes it, we were pleasantly surprised.  The food is not fancy but when exiting customers report that it's \"worth the wait\" to those waiting in 104 degree heat, you know you're know you're spending time well worth waiting.  Upon seating, we noted the myriad of photographs of famous (and mysterious) patrons who have eaten at Lotus.  

From the San Francisco Bay Area, where Thai restaurants are found on every corner, I found Lotus to capture traditional flavors, especially in the Crispy Rice appetizer and the large shrimp fried in their shells (which was amazing).  Aside from the scorching summer heat, the level of spiciness in the dishes can KO the novice.  The Thai pepper \"salsa\" is only for those with asbestos mouths--don't think that cucumber and carrots will save you, they won't.  It was too hot even for our guide who had been there weekly for over nine months.  

Overall, the meal was exciting.  I look forward going back to Las Vegas to so I may return to Lotus."}
{"text":"I must be fair - I only tried the lunch buffet for $10.99.  The menu fare may be OK.  However the buffet was reminiscent of a train station in Bangladesh.  Probably the worst buffet I've ever been to in my life!  The $10.99 price actually means it was indisputably the worst.  There was exactly one Thai item - a yellow curry chicken sauce.  Otherwise it was a very cheap Chinese buffet in disguise.  The yellow curry was even \"today's special!\"  I guess normally they don't even have that.  The \"buffet\" covered about 10 sq ft - postage stamp size.   I'm not kidding folks, this was incredibly bad.  Only go there if you're in front of the restaurant, starving, barefoot, the outside temp is 105, and you're a multi-millionaire."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!! Don't miss a visit to Lotus of Siam...and the service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food for the buck in Vegas we found in our trip. I only knocked a star off because of the wait time(25 mins) for the server to show up to get start with water. 

Well that being said all the appetizers were fantastic and the flavors were amazing. They have a vast menu and lot of chefs choices to offer. I absolutely recommend this place to everyone visiting Vegas for best food out of the strip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overrated. The Service is very good though the food is not worth the time, money and your meal. I ordered the beef lard, crispy rice appetizer which is extremely sour that you can't really tell what else it tastes like. The crispy duck Penang curry and soft shelf crab drunken noodle are insignificant IMO. Vegas has so many good restaurants and this is the 1st time I am disappointed about the food."}
{"text":"Mmmm the duck curry got me here.. I can't even remember what else I liked about this place, but everything I have ever ordered is amazing! Expect to wait, this place can get crazy!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with coworkers the other day and forgot to check in. This isn't the best Thai food and it isn't the worst. I think this place suffers from having a menu that is way too long. It was also very expensive for the amount of food that I got."}
{"text":"cliché ass place small asss meals for lots of money really not neccsary"}
{"text":"I stopped in my last trip to Vegas and ordered the crispy duck panang. It was amazing. This is now a staple of my Vegas trips although it is not on the strip. The stuffed chicken wings are fantastic and they have a great wine list. Well worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"This was on my list of must-try places in Las Vegas. I think it was a bit over-hyped. Or maybe I just didn't order properly. I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past. Some of the Northern style dishes I can't compare but I don't think they were spectacular based on their own merit. But the celebrity endorsements and accolades on the wall can't be wrong can they? 

Let me just start by saying that this restaurant is in a totally sketchy neighborhood. There's even a sign in the restaurant that says that you shouldn't leave your luggage in the car. They have luggage storage in the restaurant so you can bring your stuff in with you. The whole strip mall looks like a bombed out war zone and I'll bet it's pretty scary when it's dark. Like zombies-come-out-and-attack scary. 

It's a nice surprise when you enter the restaurant and see it bustling with, not zombies, but living humans - totally the opposite of the ghost town outside. There does seem to be the illusion that it's busier than it actually is (at least when we walked in). We requested a table for 4. They told us 45 minute wait. We said we'd come back, then they chased us down the parking lot and said 30 minutes, then as we were walking away again, they said they had a table available. When we got in, there seemed to be quite a few open tables. 

As for the food we did as advised and mostly ordered from the Northern dishes at the back of the menu.  

The Spicy Chicken Wings (regular menu) were delicious. My son said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. They were crispy and came in just enough chili sauce so the chicken didn't get soggy.

The Seafood Soup (regular menu) was okay. It was pretty spicy. The bowl came with one scallop, two mussels, a prawn and some squid. It was okay but not the best Thai Seafood soup I've had. 

The Red Chili Dip (ground pork in chili sauce) served with fried pork rinds and veggies was pretty bland. It needed salt or something. Everyone basically ignored it after one taste. 

The Garlic Prawns were FABULOUS. Crispy prawns, battered, fried with heads, shells, tails and all. Honestly, the best part were the fried shells - they were like potato chips. My hubby thought they could've used a sweet and sour dip and I agree that might have been nice, but I liked them just fine the way they were. 

The Crispy Duck with Mint Leaves were served on top of noodles in a sauce and topped with some herbs and peppers. Personally, I don't think crispy duck should be served with anything wet (like sauce) because it makes the crispiness go away. I've had some amazing crispy duck and this duck didn't really do anything for me (or my hubby who LOVES crispy duck). 

Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert was good. Nothing special. They didn't have the sticky rice with mango available. The bananas were wrapped in wonton wrappers then fried. Nothing wrong with that, but I can also make this at home. 

All of this and a couple glasses of wine came out to about $132 before tip. The prawns and the duck were both over $20 bucks. Otherwise, everything else was around $8-15. 

All in all, spicy chicken wings and garlic prawns were good. Everything else: MEH. I might go back and check out the front of menu next time. There are some pretty fine Thai restaurants in the Silicon Valley/Bay Area that I think are MUCH better."}
{"text":"The best Korean food I have ever had.  Go for the house specialties.  Softshell crab was fantastic.  Make your reservation well in advance.  This is the best restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion.  Next time I am in Vegas I may go here twice."}
{"text":"5 Stars, and here is why....

1.  If the restaurant closes at 10pm, and you can still roll in at 9:55pm for a meal - Good.  The service is still excellent - Better.  The quality of the food is still exceptional - Best.  Lotus is tops on all three accounts!

2.  Wine List and Pairing.  Not only does Lotus have an outstanding wine list, it has the largest selection of German Whites in any restaurant - in the world, if memory serves.  Also, any restaurant whose wait staff knows wine enough to pair with my meal makes me happy.  However, despite the large number of Sommeliers and wannabes in Las Vegas, I rarely find a member of the general wait staff who can confidently assign a wine to my meal without looking at the price or without pairing  by color.

3.  Of course, the food!  I know that I've enjoyed a Larb Salad in another place better, but not an entire Thai meal.  To start, three of us ordered the Hot Pot-sized Thom Kha Kai, a wonderful coconut and lime-based soup with mushrooms and chicken, which was simply pleasing.  It was creamy, tart, sweet and savory; so perfectly balanced that it could have easily satisfied me as a main course.  Next, a Larb Salad (Chicken).  This could have been better to my taste, but was well-seasoned with mint and onions and very aromatic.  Finally, the main course - Nua Yang Panang.  I love Panang curries, and this one, with its embellishment of cognac, was one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce was so good my friends and I made balls of rice to sop up every last bit - the dishwasher got off easy with us!

4.  Price.  Yes, you can spend (and maybe should spend :)) $30-40/ person at Lotus of Siam.  Yes, you can probably make decent curries at home now without the time and expense thanks to the plethora of bottled Thai sauces - think Heinz 57 of Thai...blegh!  But the total bill for all of us including my $10 glass of Piesporter, the menu listed in #3 and another's fried rice, just cleared $60 with tax.  That's right folks $15 a person!  Can you eat at any other of the World's 100 Best Restaurants at dinner for $15?  I think I hear Thomas Keller laughing...nervously...

Bottom line:  Well, worth the drive from anywhere for the excellent quality, selection and service.  A super way to dine at one of the World's Best!"}
{"text":"Went for luncheon buffet.  Pad Thai was good, but not the taste I'm used to.  Chicken wings very good.  Chicken with mint very good.  Soup OK and very spicy.  Some of the other dishes were pretty average.  We were there a few years ago and found that both the number of offerings, and the really hot spicy food had diminished somewhat.  We would go again."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few years back. So fantastic that we recommended to everyone visiting Vegas. Visited Vegas again in Dec 2015. Was looking forward to going to this place than anywhere this time. First, the place had a 1.5 hr wait for lunch. Understood, need to wait sometimes for good things to come. Next, when we got the table, the service was slow. When the food came, the main entrees came along with soup and appetizers. The food quality was mediocre at best and proportions small. What a let down for travelling across the country!! This place gets good business as they are recommended in travel books and also by their  previous  reputation. This place is done for us. Next time, I will go to other Thai restaurants in the same strip. Maybe, they believe in food quality and service."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place based on it's \"fame\" and high reviews. I have been here a handful of times and never impressed. I tried to give it multiple chances but never has excellent food or service. Probably won't return, as there are too many fabulous choices in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were skeptical about this place because of its location. The place is super dark and sketchy looking outside. As we pulled up, we noticed all of the cars in the parking lot, but had no clue where all of these people could be. The outside of the restaurant was really dark and the place looked small...until we walked in....let me tell ya..THIS PLACE IS HUGE and now we know where all of the people went! The wait was about 45 minutes, so as we were waiting by the bar, we used Yelp to view other user's pictures and definitely had to try to Crispy Garlic Prawns (which is to die for)! We also ordered a bunch of other plates and shared it between 4 people. We ordered the panang yellow curry, tom yum, pad Thai, and the papaya salad. 
This place is pretty good! Definitely will come back soon. I Would recommend this place to any Thai food lover."}
{"text":"I don't like the location or neighborhood, but the food is the best Thai food I have found in town!  The food is amazing and well worth a trip to this area.  The crispy duck with Panang curry as outstanding...I will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"As someone who lived in Thailand for a year this place taste like my second home it's amazing and the best thai food I have had in the USA!  :)"}
{"text":"During my most recent trip to Vegas, Yelp Elite Lam N. recommended hitting up Le Thai for some off-the-Strip good eats. Unfortunately, I could not get reservations until after 9 pm.  After looking through trusty Yelp, we found Lotus of Siam, which lives up to its four stars.

VENUE
Lotus of Siam looks like a dive bar. You're greeted with neon lights in the front and a bar with concrete floors and TVs right when you walk in. But don't let this trick you because this is actually a restaurant too! And Lotus of Siam serves GREAT food. The seating arrangements are a little odd-- between the bar and the host area, there are four or five dinner tables, so you have to squeeze into your table. There's a lot more room in the back, but we didn't sit in the back room area.

FOOD (4.5/5)
Interestingly, the menu is on the little 4\"x6\" folding card that you'll find on your table. At first I thought it was their happy hour menu or advertisement, but then I realized that the entire menu was on one side of the folding card. Although the selection isn't vast, you'll find plenty of entrees to keep your tummy happy.  Lotus of Siam will have all the familiar Thai dishes-- pad thai, drunken noodles, Tom Yum Koong soup, shaking beef, papaya salads, stir fry vegetables, fried bananas for dessert, coconut and brown rice and curry. I think we ordered pretty much everything, and we were very satisfied. 

SERVICE (5/5)
SO good! Most of the restaurant staff were young and they were all very gracious and helpful.  We had a large party, and they were always ready to help clear dishes, make more room (our table was small for the quantity of food we ordered), bring extra silverware and napkins, and keep our drinks refilled. They were happy to help take as many pictures as we requested, and they always kept their cool even though they were busy and dealing with a lot of food orders."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food! Wonderful service! Love their papaya salad, they ask you what spiciness you want from 1-10. My roommate and I had the chicken satay which was good. The mango and sticky rice was yummy and the Thai ice tea was yummy too."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. The food is excellent - one of the best meals I had in Vegas. It must have been a busy week night, because it took almost one hour for the food to be ready. The restaurant is in a \"sketchy\" area and the surrounding is not at all well lit, but the restaurant was packed, even 40 minutes after the closing time. It is a testament to the food that people are willing to overlook the neighborhood to eat there."}
{"text":"I have been there many times. Despite the long wait times, now they even automatically add 18% gratuity for part of 4... And the service is bad, rushing you to finish your food..."}
{"text":"My first time at this place.
When my group was driving up, my cousin noticed this area, not the prettiest area.
In this shopping complex, half the spaces are abandoned.  There was one complex with no store name and two guards standing outside.
Anyhow, here's my review on the food.
We were seated after a half hour wait on a Saturday night.  
The food is definitely overpriced!  The garlic prawns are $25!  The plate didn't have that many prawns on them!
One of my cousin's ordered a chicken dish, around $22.  The amount of chicken barely equaled one chicken breast.
The food is definitely overpriced for the portion amount.  I feel like it's all because of the hype.  However, the food tasted DELICIOUS!
I'm not sure if I'll stop by here again, maybe if I win big in Vegas..."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated.  The food are not as good as how people described. We ordered the sea bass and there was only 5 tiny peices(2 inch wide and length) of the fish filet,  the rest was mostly vegetables(this dish cost $30!!).The food has a lot of msg and the dishes are not proportioned right. More vegetables than meat. So it's like eating vegetarian food. 

If anyone is from Atlanta, ga, thai Norcross is so much better. Don't waste your time standing in line for this place.
Waiters are not friendly and they are snobs."}
{"text":"I would recommend Lotus of Siam for anyone that enjoys Thai food. I have been here a few times, it is always crowded and I would suggest making a reservation. The food is great!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good here but not exceltional.  Rated as the top place in Las Vegas for Thai food.  Definitely make a reservation.  Place gets filled up pretty fast.  The menu is huge and the food came super fast. Customer Service lacks a bit"}
{"text":"All we can say is this place is the BOMB!!  Great service, food was delicious, atmosphere perfect and and extensive wine selection. 

We will definitely be back after winning big in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic, well priced, fast service and absolutely the best Thai food in Vegas.  Just get there early and never try to order take away!!!  This business is busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, or make a reservation! We had a great experience. We did not make a reservation, so had a drink at the bar while we waited. 

Atmosphere was typical of an old school Asian restaurant. There seemed to be no dresscode, as people were both very casual and somewhat formal. 

Food was amazing - fresh and flavourful. Service was friendly and relatively quick. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great Northern Thai food and wine list that will not disappoint.  We had Garlic Prawns (5*), Sea Bass drunken noodle (4.5*) and crispy duck panang (4.5*) all medium spicy, we like heat, and a Riesling to top it off. If u like Thai food this place is great. Bonus points for the very nice and clean restrooms (Not common in the more authentic asian restaurants)"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy.  If you really want to go here and eat without a reservation, get there early.  I was there right when they opened and the restaurant was packed in about 10 minutes.  I heard about this place for their crispy shrimp and it did not disappoint.  They even fried the shrimp shell that was delicious.  Their other dishes didn't knock my socks off, but not bad by any means.  The ambiance is very nice and they have a great wine selection.  Their portions are definitely along the lines of a fine-dine with a higher prices and smaller portions."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and the prices aren't bad. The inside of the restaurant is also very nice and the service is good too. It is usually packed to so make reservations."}
{"text":"Went here last night with high expectations since they had almost 3000 reviews. Big line to get in, we waited to get in but it disappointed. Egg rolls had almost no veggies inside and were tasteless. Tum Yum soup and spicy basil chicken average. Panang curry noodles were average but arrived cold. Everyone including the waiter said the best dish is the crispy garlic shrimp $28, taste was OK but very greasy. Maybe an off night. On the plus side the staff were very friendly and courteous. Our local Thai restaurant beats this hands down."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not the best. They do have a lot of items not available at other Thai restaurants. Wait time wasn't bad. The sea bass was the most memorable dish out of everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. It is totally worth the short Uber/Lyft ride!!  We came here on a Wednesday at about 12 and there was no wait! Restaurant fills up fast. Menu was a bit extensive, but do yourself a favor and get the garlic prawns and crispy duck panang!"}
{"text":"If you want try this place. I strongly recommend you make a reservation. We waited for 1.5 hrs but if you have a pallet for Thai food it's worth the wait. They serve a lot of different Thai food that most American Thai restaurants don't make. Some of the waiters are a little snotty but some are really helpful. Over all was a great environment and amazing food. The only thing that bothered me is the waitress we had took off some of the ingredients in one of our orders (I forgot the name of the entree) which made that dish really bland. We couldn't figure out why she would do that since we didn't ask her to."}
{"text":"Make a reservation so you don't have to wait long. In terms of food, this place is just good but not worth the price. We came here bc my friend  saw the yelp reviews. We're from LA/socal so we have had a lot of Thai food. This place had some special dishes like the duck panang curry and garlic prawn many yelper mentioned. Each around $28. Good but I've had better duck and shrimp. Most disappointing is the shrimp. The plate looks full and big but it's half filled with shells!!!! They fried the shells and stack them up to make it looks full. You probably get about 6-7 pieces of shrimp...not worth the $28! Overall, this place is way overpriced for their special dishes or Thai food in general and the taste or quality does not justify it at all."}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Yes, they have all your standard favorite items, but do yourself a favor and try the back of the menu! This place specializes in northern Thai food. Branch out and try some of these items. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas, and my favorite place to send out-of-towners to. It's in a weird strip mall (as most off-strip restaurants in Vegas are) but it's a quick cab ride from most hotels on The Strip. I'm not a big fan of buffets, so I like to order off the menu. Amazing thai red curry chicken, and one of the best reisling lists in the country. Word on the street is that the chef used to cook for the emperor of Thailand."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and lunch buffet. The best deal is at lunchtime, but the food is great anytime. I would order Pad Kee Mao and I wouldn't shy away from anything.  

This restaurant is in a funky area/neighborhood, but it doesn't keep the place from filling up."}
{"text":"Some of the things are really good. Curries are delicious and so are pad thai. However, I wouldn't recommend the stuffed chicken wings, too oily and the flavors are really heavy. Overall, I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times lately.  The lunch buffet is very good and a great deal at like $11.  I'll return for that again.  However the sea bass dinner did not impress me at all.  I'm pretty fussy on my fish and this just didn't seem fresh enough for me.  I will stick to the regular thai food on future visits.  Service was top notch on both visits."}
{"text":"Absolutely the top three restaurants I've probably ever eaten in my life. The flavors the smell everybody should have an opportunity to eat in this place when they go to Las Vegas please take the time to go and give this restaurant a chance and I guarantee every time you go to Las Vegas this will be a must eat for you"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I was just as pleased as the first.  We found Lotus of Siam via a new acquaintance last time we were in Vegas.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 on a Friday night.  They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.  

I am gluten-free, and have been pleased that they will accommodate different preparations of certain dishes to meet that dietary need.  

Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced.

When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the \"Senior\" dining hour."}
{"text":"= Overall Food Quality: 3.0/5.0 =-

I stopped by here on the way back to Los Angeles with my SO. We ordered the Garlic Prawns and a Beef Panang.

Garlic Prawns: This dish was very expensive and though tasty it was not worth it by any means, essentially it's just prawns unshelled seasoned with some salt and garlic and deep fried.

Beef Panang: I thought the panang curry was alright, but the beef was extremely tough and difficult to chew.

-= Atmosphere: 3.0/5.0 =-

Not that special, it's a pretty simple restaurant within a strip mall. Lotus of Siam does seem to have a very extensive wine and alcohol collection though if you like alcohol with your thai food.

-= Service: 4.5/5.0 =-

Service was very good, I never needed to ask to refill my water and the server was very nice about me asking him questions about the food.

-= Price: 4.0/5.0 =-

The overall price of the food was decent but some dishes such as the Garlic Prawns we ordered was overpriced.

-= Overall: 3.5/5.0 =-

Overall, nothing really that special, definitely not deserving of four stars and 2000+ reviews on yelp. 

If you are ever in Los Angeles, CA, go to Pasadena and try President Thai, they have very similar food to Lotus of Siam, but the food is way better and cheaper too.

Heck I can probably name Thai 5 restaurants in Los Angeles that is better than this."}
{"text":"Overall good Thai food. It was annoying that they really skimp on the rice and charge for extra. Recommend the Khao Soi."}
{"text":"Add another rating of outstanding to the pile.  

We've eaten Thai in the depths of Thai Town in Hollywood and some really great places in Long Beach, and this--I have to say--exceeded in quality and authenticity.  

Three and a half days on the Vegas Strip, we ate at Lotus twice.  Yum.  

A note on comparison to SEA (another of our reviews):  Lotus is better, if you will take the short drive to it (and look beyond the scary strip mall it's in).  SEA is good, and has other non-Thai dishes.  Given a choice, Lotus wins easily."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of trying this restaurant without a reservation the first time and were told that it was going to be a 2 hour wait.  Oops!  We turned away and went to Border Grill instead, and made a reservation for 2 nights later.  I definitely agree with the reviews that mention the sketchy parking lot - divey area, surrounded by questionable businesses and we were accosted by several homeless people in the parking lot asking if they could wash the windshields on our car.
The menu is huge with tons of variety!  Several of the people in our party were very concerned while looking at the menu because so many of the dishes are listed with chicken, beef, or seafood, but like so many Thai restaurants, almost anything on the menu can be made vegetarian.
My friend and I shared the spicy beef salad, the roast duck curry, and the northern larb.  She raved over the curry, we both enjoyed the salad (although definitely the least interesting of our dishes), but my standout favorite was the northern larb.  Perfectly spiced, really interesting flavors, and something that is pretty unique.
Prices were reasonable, service was good.  Food was delicious.  I definitely recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Reviewers say this is the best Thai in Vegas, maybe even North America. I've only had Thai in about 4 places, so I'm not educated enough to say it's the best anywhere, but it is certainly the best I've ever had. 

Place is in a real hole. I mean, I'd NEVER drive into this outdoor mall area on a whim. But don't judge it from the outside. Interior is perfectly fine and clean. Recent expansion helps a lot. I was here in 2008 and found it to be wildly good, but cramped and hot. Not a problem anymore. 

Menu is diverse and complete. I like the \"jerky\" appetizer a lot, then moved on to the Tom Kha Kai soup, spicy thai salad, noodles, curries, and more basil noodles. Nothing was short of very good. Some of it excellent. Thai beers perfectly neutralize the flamthrower heat put off by those evil little green thai chiles. Easily the hottest damn thing I've ever bitten into thinking it was part of a green bean or something. I was sweating like Mac in the movie Predator talking about the \"same moon, different jungle\" while dry shaving his cheek. 

My single criticism is menu descriptions like \"Plar Dook O-Cha\" do nothing for this English only American. Waiters have thick accents and do not seem to follow requests of \"what is this?\" when pointing at the menu. But, that's really my problem being so ignorant. Whatever it is, it's probably good or great anyway. 

Can't go wrong here. Good for groups or couples. Reasonably kid friendly too. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been too.  This place is top notch.  When I'm out in Las Vegas for business I away dine at this place."}
{"text":"Garlic shrimp was okay, didn't live up to the hype.
Also ordered papaya salad, tom yum and green curry. Curry was excellent. Tom Yum was weak, too sour and not enough heat. Papaya salad was decent but I have had better.

We were lucky to get there at 5:30. Make a reservation or get there early if you don't want to wait 2 hrs."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. I never review a place after my first experience I always wait. I have been here now several times and the food and service has not faltered in the slightest. I judge all Thai restaurants on the same things: Yellow Curry, Pad Thai and the level of spiciness and this place gets 100's in every category. Do yourself a favor and rush to this spot!"}
{"text":"I had the drunken noodles and fried sea bass as a main course, girlfriend had a curry chicken mild. Both dishes were outstanding. Wait staff was informative of the menu, wait time for food was quick even though the place was packed. Nothing bad to say about this place if you want great food at a great price this little hidden gem in Vegas is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in LV. Always fresh and always friendly staff. The location is not that great but it is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a serious diamond in the rough.

And I mean that... this area is super ghetto and it's pretty much next door to a swingers club. 

I went back out to Vegas to visit my parents last weekend and this was the first place I asked to go to. I'm a HUGE riesling fan and this place has a wine list like I've never seen. Seriously. If you love rieslings and are in Vegas, you HAVE TO come here. I'm not even that into Thai and I go here. 

But, since one needs to eat in order to drink more, I recommend their sea bass. Pricey but seriously delicious. My dad got their equivalent of broccoli beef and it wasn't so wonderful. Just bland. Their dessert (the fried banana one) also left something to be desired (that something was ice cream since the thing was a dry as bone) but I just waved down the waiter and got some. Problem solved! 

Anyway, go out here. You'll feel like a real Vegas insider and have the chance to try some really special wine. 

Oh, and eat too. :) 

PS: Call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"I went here with a local who searches out off-the-strip experiences. Unlike many other reviewers, the strip mall milieu was unsurprising. Hey man, some of the best local eateries are tucked between a massage parlor and a wig shop. 

I'm not the biggest Thai food fan,  but I know what I like, and I LOVED this. Everything tasted incredible. We ordered the sum thom salad, which was generously vinegary, and a steaming bowl of tom khai coconut soup, level 7, which was a deeply revelatory experience to everyone at the table. Two of my party even declared pre-soup that they hate coconut-based concoctions, but after trying one spoonful they were ladling it out right fast. We found level 7 to be satisfyingly spicy without being bland. For an entree I ordered the pork panang curry, level 7. Delicious. Not the best in the world, and the pork was a little bland, but it was oddly comforting food. I would have preferred it a little spicier, but I suspect they think white ladies are lying when they ask for hot and spicy food. Girl I am not lying: I like my spicy! For drinks we ordered a flight of Riesling, which perfectly complemented the food. This is a must purchase for any spicy meal. 

Lotus of Siam you are delicious. You left me content and full-bellied. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place seated us very quickly. We came on a weekday for lunch. Drinks were ordered, came fast. We ordered the crispy duck panang curry ($27) and  seafood drunken noodles($14) It was good but not worth the price. The actual curry was very tasty! I wish the prices weren't crazy though. 

Service was not that great. We had two different waiters, I think? And they didn't really check up on us. And we got up to get our own chopsticks and silverware."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in the country no question! Some must try dishes are the beef tendon soup, crispy garlic prawn, and crispy duck over drunken noodles"}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food, great ambiance - absolutely excellent experience.  I've taken my sister and niece, some friends who were visiting, and been there with local friends and each time, it has lived up to its reputation."}
{"text":"The punchline unfortunately has to be \"shockingly disappointing food\".

We walked in without reservation and had a short wait of 25 minutes.

We began with Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice). The dish was not to my taste, as the sourness of the lime was too overpowering.

Next we had the Tom Kah Kai. This mushroom soup with a coconut milk based broth proved inedible despite our best efforts and was unquestionably the lowlight.

We ordered drunken noodles with soft shell crab as our first entree. The noodles were passable but soggy, the crab meat was chewy.

Our final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless. It also had an unusual but pleasant sweetness.

Though the food was a disappointment, staff was prompt, friendly, and attentive with wait staff checking in frequently (though not too often).

The price was also very reasonable for Las Vegas.

Overall, I would recommend dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very rude service. Gave my name for the waiting list and ladies at front were making fun of my name. Before you make fun of someone's name, make sure that person does not know Thai. It shows your ignorance. Food was not that great and very expensive. There are other Thai restaurants with better food and less expensive.  Not coming back again."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Las Vegas if you enjoy Thai food.  The place itself doesn't look like much, located in an older mall.  But the food is unbeatable.  I would recommend the drunken noodle with sea bass and prawn.  The dish was absolutely amazing.  

Not only the drunken noodles, but their whole menu was fabulous.  I can't even remember what I had! All I remember is that we roughly about 10 different things. Each one of their items was fantastic.  I have been here many times and I just randomly point at things that I want, when it comes out, it's great."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Thai food in a place you would never expect. Take advantage of having this place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  This place is the real deal.  Hard to say if it's the best Thai food in the country, but it's easily among the best I've ever had.

Everything was a highlight, but in particular the papaya salad and some chicken dish with Thai basil and mint stand out.  Oh, plus the dessert of mango and sticky rice....yummm
."}
{"text":"Poor service and store manager seems not care of customer complaint. Soup was serving cold."}
{"text":"In great anticipation, we made our way from our hotel to the restaurant.  We were there at 5:45 and had no problems being seated right away. 

We had the #14 nam kao tod meat salad, garlic prawns, tom kha gai soup and crispy duck on drunken noodles.  It was a lot of food, enough for a doggie bag for later too.  
To drink, Thai ice tea (creamy almost like an iced coffee) and a Thai Lime drink  (refreshing but too sweet, ask for less sugar). 

Total came to around $75.00 for the two of us.  

Now, I may be crucified for this but, it wasn't knock my socks off amazing.  It was delicious, but I've been spoiled with Thai food here in Toronto.  We go to Express Thai on Dufferin which is owned and operated by a Thai family, and I feel the flavours there are just as fresh and authentic as Lotus of Siam.  We ordered all the things that were rec'd to us, but next time I'll have to be a bit more adventurous with our choices to really experience the magic of this place."}
{"text":"We don't really eat a lot of Chinese or Thai food at all but we had to try this since everyone says its the best out there.

We went here twice with a large group and was able to share a lot of the dishes. We had:

Stuffed chicken (ok)
Reg chicken wings (pretty good)
duck with drunken noodles (good)
braised beef (pretty good)
garlic prawns (ok)
seabass (ok)
duck pho (nothing special)

From our experience we weren't too impressed but neither of us are crazy about Thai or Chinese food but I can see how people can like this since it's pretty flavorful."}
{"text":"A little difficult to find, park behind the building and enter from the parking lot. Not the nicest area but the food is worth it! Absolutely delicious! We had 5 dishes, and would order all again. The standout was the sea bass over wide noodles, (recommended by our waiter) unbelievable.  Lightly fried, flaky and moist.  We could not stop eating it!  
Will definitely return here~"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. It has a wonderful ambiance. The food is delicious and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food ask for spicy. 
Strange location but worth the trip to find.  
This is a recommendation of penn Sunday school. Spot on"}
{"text":"When we arrived we had to wait over forty minutes to get a table. We ordered three different main courses to share. The food all arrived cold. We asked them to remake the food and all they did was microwave it and bring it back to us. The Penang curry had about half as much chicken as any standard Thai restaurant and the chicken was very tough. The rice that came with the curry was smaller than a single ice cream scoop, so not enough for even one person. The crispy duck with drunken noodles was not crispy, but actually squishy. The Pad Thai was flavored well, but had almost no chicken in it. I think we were able to count three or four tiny pieces of chicken. Overall, I was not impressed. The duck was nearly $30 and there wasn't even enough food for one person. We left hungry and decided not to risk ordering a dessert. I know this place has high reviews, but all I can think is that people who review it highly haven't had much Thai food. Most Thai restaurants provide better food for better prices than this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a true Thai restaurant. Authentic and affordable. We were in Vegas for only four days. We loved this restaurant so much that we went back again before we left. We ordered the tom yum koong, chicken in mint sauce, shrimp spicy fried rice and drunken noodles. All were delicious. We will visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Granted, I've only been to two Thai restaurants in my life.  Compared to the other restaurant I went to, this is, in fact, not the best Thai food in the United States, nor even in Las Vegas.  Going by taste alone, I enjoyed my dinner, but having ordered the exact same thing elsewhere, it did not match up.  It should not matter what menu I order from, if something is served on the menu from a restaurant touted as the best in the United States, I shouldn't have to limit myself to a particular item or set of items to taste this quality.

The location, as others have mentioned, is absolutely horrible.  Off the strip on Sahara, it's hidden away in an area that makes me feel uncomfortable every time I go there.  The interior was nothing special and did not stand out to me...seemed quite unauthentic, way to strip-mallish, but alas I've never been to Thailand, I would not know what is truly authentic.  We happened to sit nearby a group who met with the owners, who both seemed nice but Bill was quite dressed down for whatever he was doing that evening (sweatshirt and sweatpants...not quite what I was expecting).  Like I've mentioned in other reviews, appearance and first impressions mean a lot when you eat out...much of the reason why many never come back.

To have to put so much into going here (reservations a week in advance or waiting a few hours if you come unannounced, I was expecting more.  The reviews here were for the most part spot on, but to each their own I suppose.  I came with high expectations and left wishing I'd never came."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, great prices.  What a jewel in a city of gold.  Popular so book in advance.  Outside appearance misleading."}
{"text":"45 minute wait was well worth it.  This was some of the best Thai food I've ever had.  Ordered Pad Thai with Chicken, Drunken Noodles with beef and Garlic Prawns.  Everything was delicious!!!  We will definitely be back and will try other things in the menu."}
{"text":"The best Thai food this side of Chang Mai!

Do yourself a favor and head straight to the back of the menu for any of the Northern specialties.

I was in the north of Thailand 3 years ago and had khao soi.... been dreaming of it ever since and never find it on the menus of Thai restaurants I have tried in my area. Lotus of Siam to the rescue! 

Found myself in Vegas and knew I had to try this place. It's a large restaurant in an unassuming strip mall but man, do they deliver on their Northern Thai cuisine. The khao soi was everything I remembered from my trip. Service was excellent, large Chang beers were cold, and I couldn't have asked for a better re-introduction to my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"Food is good...but the portions have gotten smaller"}
{"text":"The food was very good but this restaurant is overpriced.  Servings are small and prices extremely high.  Just because demand for Thai food is up it doesn't mean this establishment should take advantage and rip off patrons."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! It's not as small and quaint as it used to be back in the day but so many reviews and food tv visits let the word out and they had to expand. Part of the fun used to be waiting to get in and everybody was excited to be there. Would be a five star review but the place has definitely lost its ambiance and just tries to pump as many people through the doors as possible. Should've stayed small and make us wait-it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I was told to wait for 1 hour (Tuesday night). When I got in, there were many empty tables. Do they have to make it look like they are real busy? 

The Tom Yum soup is way too sour.  It taste like vinegar. Took only 1 spoon. Yuck! Wasting $16 for the soup. 
Green curry alone is $12 (round up from 11.95), added $3 for shrimp. $15 for a small bowl of curry. Ridiculous expensive.
A small dish of seabass $31. Not even enough for 1 person. Ridiculous expensive. 
Thai Salad with just salad and a small bowl of sauce $9. Ridiculous expensive. Should not even called a dish.
18% gratuity automatic added to receipt for a party of 5.

Ridiculous expensive. Food is not good enough for that ridiculous high price. I will never come back."}
{"text":"If you like spicy and flavorful Thai food, this is the place in Vegas. Highly recommended! The best I have had! The place is in a modest neighborhood and you would never think you would find a spot like this in the area but never mind about he surroundings.. dig in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have eaten here at least a dozen times. (I live kind of far away to admit that). The menu is comprehensive as is the wine list. You can have amazing really gourmet Thai fare, or you can go for authentic simple peasant dishes. Both amazing in their own right; simple and delicious or complex. I actually like their salads and curries. They'll put together anything you want if you don't see exactly what you want on the menu. They are very accommodating. I almost always order their seafood and it really just perfect. There is a newer section to the restaurant that I am not as fond of for seating. It pays to make a reservation and specify you want a quiet corner, if that is what you  are looking for. They will take good care of you. This place is a class act but the atmosphere is not what you might expect for this caliber of food. But really, it's part of the quirky nature of Vegas."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to conclude my Vegas trip with Lotus of Siam for lunch (not buffet). It's located in a plaza that hosts an interesting colony of Asian restaurants. Lunch time was busy (wait wasn't bad), service was good, price average. A lot of the customers seemed to have come from the conventions or business people on lunch breaks. We ordered tom yum goong, green curry with beef, chicken satay, and a seafood salad. Everything was intense in flavour--sour, spicy, sweet, salty. The food was decent, but I have definitely been spoiled by reading the reviews granting 5-stars, or by living in LA. I would come back again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"yum yum

thai iced coffee

fried tofu starter

and lots of the basics

try the lunch buffet

but be prepared to wait in a long line"}
{"text":"Best Thai place in all of Vegas! Long wait but worth it! Shady location but incredible food"}
{"text":"Come here expecting to get an average Thai meal with above average service and atmosphere and you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Someone told us this was one of the best Thai food restaurants in the country.  Apparently a lot of the celebrity chefs dine here when they want good Thai food.

I believe it.

Hands down, best Thai food I've ever had.  One of our friends said that he thought it tasted better than what he had in Bangkok.

First we ordered the Crispy Rice with sausage.  This was probably my least favorite dish, but everyone else loved it.  It has very strong mint and lime favors, and it's different than anything I've ever eaten.  It was my least favorite, but it was still good.

Then he had the pad thai, northern red curry, and drunken noodle soft shell crab.  EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious.  The northern red curry looked more like a stew than a curry (I guess that's how they do it in northern Thailand?), but it was still very tasty!  The drunken noodle soft shell crab was AMAZING.  Just writing about it makes me want to drive back out to Vegas...

A MUST-TRY whenever you're in town."}
{"text":"Order the most divine crispy duck, get it served in panang with sticky rice (not steamed).  Enjoy the crisp smooth flavor of the duck with your utensil of choice, then sop up the panang sauce with the sweet jasmine sticky rice in your paws."}
{"text":"If you were to type ' Las Vegas Thai Restaurant' , in a search engine, there is a reason why Lotus of Siam is probably going to be the 1st thai restaurant you'll see. Although I think there are a few thai restaurants in town that are better, there is no denying that the menu top to bottom, is impressive, which is why Im giving them 5 stars vs 4. Location sucks, but its very close to the strip, which makes it worth the visit. You cant go wrong choosing this place, if your indecisive on choosing a specific thai restaurant. Their Pepper Garlic Chicken is the best thai dish in the city PERIOD. Id also recommend their chili mint chicken. Soups are above average! The last good thing I have to say is if you order SPICY, you get SPICY, unlike other thai spots in town."}
{"text":"The very best asian food in Las Vegas. I'm a huge fan.  I am obsessed with the duck and drunken noodles! Make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"I mean seriously, Thai food doesnt get better than this. From the Bible sized wine list to the drunken seafood noodles, try it all! you won't be disappointed. Just one tip, be prepared to wait a while if you go on a weekend or during busy convention times or whatnot. Also, it's much less questionable looking inside than out... dont judge it by the scuzzy strip mall location."}
{"text":"One food writer once said that a certain rice dish at Lotus of Siam was nothing short of a worldview. This writer was correct. We had that dish and were blown away, noting that we had never had anything quite like it. We sampled a number of dishes--all of them superb. Jonathan Gold, Gourmet Magazine, said, \"The single best Thai restaurant in North America,\" and this is no exaggeration. You will not be disappointed, though you may have to wait a bit. If you have any doubts just look at their 'resume' on the wall as you enter: just about every major newspaper or magazine in the US raves about Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand for 7 years, I know this is defnitely the best Thai food in LV. There are alot of good americanized thai food places in this city, but I think this place is by far the most authentic. I would highly recommend this place. I always take my visitors here.My favorite restaurant in las vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. It is world famous people came here, television networks came here, I gave it a 4 only because, with a group they split the check in 2 per check, no individual, the lunch portions are too small. I'm 130 pounds and can eat 2 plates. People are telling me come back for dinner. Everything else is great"}
{"text":"I'm totally disappointed with service and food at this place. I have been coming to Lotus for years, but today during lunch was one of my worst service. Pad Thai was overlooked and lack flavor. We also order the Pepper Garlic chicken this dish had no flavor at all and was cold. Even our jasmine tea was cold. Service was really bad. I didn't even get a plate. When we share with waiter how disappointed we were about our meal. He didn't acknowledge or even apologized. I was not looking for a free meal at all. I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Lotus. From the outside, it appeared to be a tiny hole in the wall. The huge number of cars should have been a clue, because we walked in to a large restaurant. We tried calling ahead, and were shocked when they told us they had no remaining reservations...for a Monday evening...at a place off the strip. We decided to go the wait route and had a beer at their large bar while we waited. We started with bacon wrapped shrimp. For our entrees we decided on the classic Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles Crispy Duck. Everything was  good- we were between 3 and 4 stars. Our deciding factor is always, \"would we return on our next trip?\" We both said no."}
{"text":"This place is truly gem of Las Vegas. I'd love every second spending time here. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This food is so good!! Everytime i visit Vegas i eat here. I always get their garlic prawn, crab rice, and charbroiled prawn with fresh chili and lime. its to die for!!!!!!!!!!

Its not in the best area but its worth it. There's alot of poor people and its not well lit."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by a local friend. He said it was the best Thai in Vegas, hands down. It's located in an economically--and otherwise--depressed strip mall. (There's a bedraggled \"Adult Day Care\" two doors down with a flickering, half-lit neon sign. Love you, mom and dad.) I'm not complaining about that, though. In my experience if a local tells you that something's the best and it's in a terrible location, you're usually in for a real treat. So I was actually getting more excited. 

A few of our party were under 5 minutes late and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor by seating us. They were very busy, but we *did* have reservations. 

When the waiter came by, he was very much in a hurry. As a NYer, I don't generally have a problem with that, but I rarely see a waiter rush like that, with no effort to be hospitable at all. The guy who filled our waters was far more personable and helpful. 

I ordered the Massaman Curry, which is a standard/classic dish. When I got it it wasn't hot, but warm verging on room temperature and it sat there cooling more as we waited several minutes for the rice to arrive. When I tasted it, the flavors were great, but there was no spice at all. The waiter didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it and I didn't ask because usually at a Thai place, they just give you 'medium spice for an American' if you don't specify. 

The prices were very decent and more inline with their location than their apparent popularity, which is good. 

Locals seem to love this place, so maybe I just had bad luck. It happens. But based on my experience, the place gets two stars."}
{"text":"Only giving it 3 stars because the Food is good but the menu was too much. Lousy review I know but the duck curry northern style was delicious but then again Chada Street and Chada have the same style of cooking. Sorry."}
{"text":"I had a very hard time every day in Las Vegas  trying to decide whether to eat at Lotus or Komal.  Life is just brutal sometimes.  I could MOVE to vegas just to be near them."}
{"text":"The best place to eat in Vegas! Excellent food, service and price."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in Vegas! 
My favorite is Crispy Duck Panang Curry, even-though I am not a duck eater! I would never order duck menu in any restaurant, but the first time we went there, my husband ordered it and it becomes our favorite. The duck's skin is sooo crispy, the meat is so tender, and it doesn't have that smell which I do not like from duck. 
I like how their Thai tea is not too sweet like in other Thai restaurants..
Tom yum goong is good too, I just wish the portion was a little bigger...

Prepare for long wait if you decide to go without reservation!!!"}
{"text":"We came here from LA that has arguably has the best Thai in the country. This place is amazing and rivals some of my favorite places in LA. 

 It's in a strip mall but the interior is welcoming. It is a nice place to beat The Strip's craziness. I will
come here for a local Vegas perspective. 

GARLIC PRAWNS!!! To die!"}
{"text":"Exceeded my extremely lofty expectations and my server Mai gave me the candid advice needed to male it possible. Squid salad, Papaya and steamed Chilean seabass and a delightfuly dry reisling."}
{"text":"Wow! Garlic shrimp is to die for! Our whole meal was amazing. Wife and I are making this a must stop every time we go to Vegas! Thanks for a great meal and great staff!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation before coming! If you don't, I would recommend getting to the restaurant before open (around 5 pm) to start standing in line- especially if you're trying to go on a weekend. 

The crispy garlic prawns is definitely the highlight. Perfectly crispy and garlicky but consistently a little on the salty side for my taste. However, the flavor is so good that I can't complain. 

The crispy duck panang curry is also very good. You could adjust the spiciness level (up to 10) and warning- their spicy is SPICY!! 

I wouldn't get some of the dishes you could order at normal thai restaurants. We ordered pad see ew and pad kee mao to supplement our meal and neither were memorable (i would even argue that it was not that great). Their papaya salad though was a perfect combo of tangy and sweet!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype people. Los Angeles has way better Thai Food.  The food isn't bad just way over hyped.  Also the worse service ever.  Waited over 40 minutes on two separate occasions for our orders when they told us it'd be 20 minutes."}
{"text":"It's all about the food here!  Service is mediocre, decor pretty mundane and the location kind of creepy but the food more than makes up for it.  Our table of six enjoyed the stuffed chicken wings, dumplings, curries and drunken noodles.  They feature an extensive wine list as well.  If you can get reservations....GO,"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a strip mall in a run-down-looking part of town.  Inside, the place is remarkably spacious and elegant looking.  Even on a Tuesday nite, it was packed and we had to wait for half a hour w/o reservations.  We tried the crispy rice as an appetizer and the green curry w/ chicken and drunken noodles w/ seafood.  The crispy rice had a nice texture but was unimaginably overseasoned.  I think they may have emptied the whole salt shaker by accident.  The green curry was pretty good but small in portions.  The drunken noodles was the highlight of the meal with yummy fresh seafood and greasy good noodles.  I'm giving one free pass for the overseasoned appetizer until my next visit.  A good place to go away from the strip but I recommend calling for reservations first."}
{"text":"If you are reading this review....plan on going there for dinner...tomorrow (at the earliest) as the wait is usually long unless you have a reservation. Same day reservations are kinda hard to get....but worth a try.
My In-Laws accompanied my wife and me for dinner here. We had our reservation at 8:00 and walked in at 7:55 PM and were seated right away. The service was quick and the server gave us a quick run down on the popular dishes. 
We had the crispy duck with noodles which was heavenly. We also had the sausage, red chilli dip and the garlic shrimp. The shrimp seemed a tad expensive but it was so decadent....the red chilli dip was spicy and had a nice flavor. The sausage was slightly sour, spicy and did not seem greasy at all.
If you like spicy/hot food....order a 8/10. If you are weak minded and adventure is not your thing....6 should get you there!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is located in a shopping strip in an older part of town, but do not hesitate to go. The server was so kind and gracious, the curry was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the value was unbelievable.  Even if you think you don't like Thai, you're going to love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Thai food. Red pumpkin curry, duck on drunken noodles, great flavors, great service, great value! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"heard that Anthony Bourdain had visited so we stopped by on recent trip to Vegas. AMAZING food. and even more amazing wine list. both pretty surprising given nondescript location and underwhelming exterior. be sure to order something you have never had before to take advantage of the regional specialities offered that you won't see anywhere else."}
{"text":"Two words: GARLIC PRAWNS!! Amaze balls! So worth it, that after a bite or two, we had to order another plate for us! Who knew that prawns could be sooo tasty that you wouldn't think twice about eating the shell?

The menu is quite extensive, so we were only able to sample several dishes here. We tried the red chili dip (Ming Tsai's recommendation), chicken satay, the chicken soup with a coconut base and hints of lemongrass (amazing!), seafood salad, braised short ribs (panang). All were tastefully done and lived up to the spice level scale. Since they didnt have the mango sticky rice (our server said they only have this during the summer), I settled for an order of fried bananas with coconut ice cream; it did not disappoint.

I was highly impressed with the service that we received once we were seated,
given that it was a typical busy Friday night. Our drinks were refilled constantly and both of our servers seemed to be on the same page. We were always greeted with smiles from our two servers and they seemed genuinely happy to know that we really enjoyed our first meal at Lotus of Siam.

My biggest lesson learned from this visit was reservations, reservations, reservations!! It was obvious that the word is out about the fantastic food here at Lotus of Siam, so make reservations as early as you can to avoid being put on the waitlist. Unfortunately, I tried making reservations for a Friday night on that same day and they were all booked.
Our party of three had to wait between 45-60 minutes, which seemed like a long time given that we were starving and frustrated to see people walk in and get seated once they entered.

Lotus of Siam is hands down one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. The decor is simple and doesn't look like your typical Thai restaurants. This isn't a bad thing, as the place is still classy with a plethora of wine bottles on display and a noteworthy clean bathroom (which sadly isn't typical at a handful of Asian restaurants). I will definitely be back, even just for the garlic prawns, and plan to try some new dishes! Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"We were there for spring break vacation. Cousin recommended the place. It looks like a dump from outside but it's nice inside and very large place. We skipped the buffet and ordered from the menu. Food was very good."}
{"text":"3.5 

One of the better Thai restaurants I've been to. I ordered the Nam Prik Ong because it was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate, and my bf ordered the Pad Thai. Neither of our dishes were extremely spicy although we had ordered them 10/10 spicy. I enjoyed my dish, it was very flavorful, but honestly, it just tasted like a meat sauce from a pasta dish. Next time, I'm going to order one of the many other great things they have on their menu. 

My bf's pad thai was delicious, and our chicken dumpling appetizer was good too, albeit not Thai food :) We also got a thai iced tea, which I normally find too sweet for my liking. This was definitely on the sweet side, but I still managed to finish the whole thing. 

I'm looking forward to coming back and maybe trying some of their other meat or curry dishes."}
{"text":"Everything was very good to fantastic...we started with the fried wantans and Garlic Prawns, the prawns were very tasty...then we followed with the Pad Thai, which was very good.  The main course was where it was at...the Crispy Duck with Panang...it was amazing, and the green curry with chicken...wow.  We also had an order of the drunken noodles which were very good...overall probably the best Thai food I have ever had.  Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is one of those hidden gems as they say.  Yet everybody from the local foodie Las Vegan to celebrity chefs and Hollywood folk have been to Lotus of Siam.  Voted one of the top 50 restaurants in the USA.  Truly a great place with amazing food and a wine list that goes on and on!  We frequent Lotus once or twice a month, highly recommend if you get the chance !  Not pretty on the outside, but the food and service (interior pretty nice considering the exterior) surely make up for the curb appeal.  Hard to find, but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Just got another typical response from Cox communications.  I've been complaining about the same problem with my email for 6 months now this was the fourth time I've called it in and after explaining the problem twice and then stating that it was ridiculous that I was having to explaining it again and been on the phone for 40 minutes THEY HUNG UP ON ME! As I said, \"typical.\"  We became Cox customers 7 years ago and now I will definitely be looking for an alternative."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. The area around the restaurant looked a bit deserted and I was skeptical to go inside the small door. But as soon as I entered my whole perception changed. The restaurant smelled amazing and the ambience was really good. 
One Tip: If going for dinner please expect at least an hour's wait."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing Thai food. The garlic prawns alone are worth the trip off the strip!"}
{"text":"Glad we set aside the time to dine in here while in Vegas. Had the garlic prawns ( so good I ordered another order after finishing the first plate), drunken noodles with soft shell crab, tom khai soup, curry duck were all excellent. You see any celebrity pics with the owner echo is cool to see. Lots of world renowned chefs all cosign this place and for obvious reasons.

Also, service was great. Very attentive and courteous. I will return and would recommend anyone who enjoys Thai food to make the trip out to this part of town."}
{"text":"Best Thai food since I visited Thailand! Hard to get a table, but when you do, it's worth it! This place is not about how fancy the decor, the silverware  nor the  glassware, it's all about the food! No they don't dress it up with garnishes or try to make it look pretty, just good old fashion good food."}
{"text":"Solid food at decent prices.  The stuffed chicken wings were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food and taste but price and quantity made me score it really low. The crab fried rice was a tiny mound, maybe good for one person. The pad see ew was the smallest portion ever! There was 4 adults eating and we all got a couple nibbles each. We all left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied with the amount. I really expected a lot more since its so famous for their food."}
{"text":"We were worried that this restaurant wouldn't live up to the hype, but it did! We over ordered as we wanted to try so many things from the menu. 

We started with the garlic shrimp and some soup. The shrimp were nothing short of spectacular. The breeding wasn't overdone and the flavor was amazing. We tried a noodle dish, the crispy duck in a curry sauce, and a sea bass dish. Each dish was better than the one before. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.

We decided to try the mango sticky rice for dessert. I was shocked how the mango served with it was so sweet. It may have been the best mango I've ever had!

We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. They have the best pad thai noodle and if your looking for really spicy food this place has it down. When you order a level 10, they as you if your sure because they won't take it back if it is too hot! and if you can handle the 10, ask them for some extra whole Thai chili's on the side. :) 

They have a big menu, with a verity of northern and southern Thai style food. Be aware that sometime the wait can be long during dinner especially on the weekends. It's a very popular place!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for some time. My husband and I were excited to finally go...despite having difficulty finding this place it was pretty good. The menu was huge and I had trouble deciding on what to order! We started with a bowl of Tom Kah Kai...very disappointing. Pretty much just broth..minimal chicken and even less mushrooms. For appetizer we got the chicken larb. Tasty. Entrees were pineapple duck red curry and a beef dish with cabbage(number58) both good, but portions are VERY small. Not worth the price...bussers on point..never a dirty dish and poured our beer for us! Still going to stick to thee BEST Thai restaurant ever, Lao Thai!!! (Nellis and Harris)."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! They don't accept reservations so we get there early and have wine and an appetizer at the bar while waiting for a table. Favorite dishes are the drunken prawns or the short rib curry. Pair either with a bottle of Turley red and your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food!! As soon as you enter the restaurant, you get a wonderful aroma of authentic Thai food. Curry is just amazing. Their spicy can get real spicy. Portion sizes are good. Ambience is very basic lunch room types."}
{"text":"Fun find in vegas. Just two of is for lunch- we didn't order things we normally do at Thai restaurants so I can't make a direct comparison. Green chili dip was a highlight. Garlic prawns and dried beef appetizer both good. Made the mistake of ordering two sticky rice to go with dip- then they brought more steamed rice for table. We had a mountain of rice. This will be a regular stop when we come to town. The only negative was the frantic and chaotic yet really inefficient service- strange..."}
{"text":"Came here during a business trip. Delicious food, great service, good environment"}
{"text":"Very very good food. It's probably the best Thai food I've found here so far. The beef pad se ew was delicious. The only reason I didn't give Lotus of Siam a 5 star is because they do not have a lunch specials."}
{"text":"My cousin's bf had heard so much about this infamous Thai restaurant that he booked a 9pm reservation so that we could squeeze it in after our huge buffet lunch that day. My belly was bursting at its seams, but no complaints because this place was worth the extra calories.

Good things:
- Pad Kee Mow: This isn't one of the popular menu items, but I thought it was executed the best. The noodles had a nice texture to them and the flavor of the noodles were pretty good overall.
- Crispy Duck with Panang Curry: The duck was just ok, but the curry was really tasty. The downside is that this dish is like $20 for a few measly pieces of deep fried bird.
- Pad Thai: Another typical Thai restaurant item, but the noodles here are really thin and the color doesn't appear to be as artificially orange as at other places.
- Service: They have really great service here. Waiters always stopped by to fill glasses of water and always with a smile. 
- Variety of choices: This restaurant's menu is literally a book. It is HUGE. Here you will find Thai dishes from all different regions, and all seemingly pretty tasty.

Just ok:
- Drunken noodles with crab: Most excited to try this, but the crab was disappointing. It was so fried that it was soft and soggy. 
- Nam Kao Tod: The crispy fried rice appetizer; this had a funky sour taste, but I was the only one at my table that didn't enjoy it so to each his own!

The good thing is that their menu is so extensive that picky eaters will have to find something to like. The not so good things are that portion sizes aren't huge for what you're paying for. Also, just to note, they make their food SPICY (even mild is hot hot hot), and if you make reservations there's a 5-minute grace period for your party to arrive by. Not so forgiving :/ Ultimately, I'm not sure if it's worth making a trip out of the strip for again, but worth a try!"}
{"text":"When we saw the bldg/location... ah uh-oh, ick.  But went in... inside is like the Tardis... a wonderful  surprise ... large, well-decorated, great staff.  Food is delicious..  garlic prawns, northern larb, and pad thai For-the-Win!!!  Unsolicited, the owner's daughter came over and let us know about the Gluten free items... huge GF selection, cooked in separate wok, etc.  WE WILL RETURN so delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place so much I have been coming here ever since I was a baby. I never thought to check in so today is the day. Tom Kah Kai is a must it's currently my second favorite food but it is because :
1 it has plenty of herbs 
2 uses perfectly cooked chicken 
3 great spices in it especially the lemon grass and basil leaves 
4 coconut milk, I have always disliked liquid coconut but this is amazing 
  
   They have great service, a very big wine selection I might add which is always good plus great food. Pork, chicken, or beef Pad Thai is fabulous. You can choose  the spice level ( as the same with all the dishes) and it has a good amount of veggies. Next time your on this side of town please come hear."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Las Vegas, and maybe the best Thai food in America. Anthony Bourdain visited here in one of his tv shows and specifically praised their Northern Thai menu selections. 

Everything I've ever ordered from here has been fantastic. This place is incredible, and was very reasonably priced ($10 - $15 per person, approximately)"}
{"text":"As vegetarians, we ADORE this place. Nearly everything on the menu can be made vegetarian or vegan even if it doesn't say so. Just ask your server! 

We had our first date here and every year we return to re-enact that beautiful evening. 

Our favorites: 

Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the

Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild. 

Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home! 

I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal. If you had a less than spectacular time, try again. It is so worth it! 

And yes . . . the parking lot is a little sketchy sometimes, but this has no bearing on my tastebuds. Go with a friend!"}
{"text":"Huge menu, nice staff, good food!  The menu is almost overwheling in size, but every dish I've tried has been very good.  Weekdays for lunch they have a cheap buffet, but the options are a little boring but still tasty.  Only giving 4 stars because the location is a little sketchy and my hubby found eggshell in his fried rice and the waitress could not have cared less."}
{"text":"We were recommended to this place by a couple the next before.  The restaurant opens at 5.30pm for dinner.  We got to the restaurant at around 5pm and there was already a line outside.  

We ordered the stuffed chicken wings for appetizer,  chicken larb for salad, and drunken noodles with soft crab shell and dry pork curry noodles for entrees.  One word - Delicious! Delicious! Okay, I lied, 2 words.  Now I understood why the wait to get in.  

The place is clean and spacious, and the servers were really friendly."}
{"text":"Great food!  My stomach was very happy and I couldn't stop eating. They serve the food fast too so you don't have to wait long. And they got a good selection of wine as well."}
{"text":"Best dish ever, Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  Enough said."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Loved every dish.. the chicken dumplings were so delicious. I highly recommend the duck.. definitely coming back again. Pad Se-ew highly recommend. A must if your in Las Vegas.. the only thing that was not so good was the service. Could have been better."}
{"text":"Extensive menu selection. Great food.  Suggest you eat family style to enjoy as many dishes as possible."}
{"text":"When visiting Vegas, I always stop and eat here at Lotus of Siam. It's the best Thai food.  Don't let the strip mall worry you, the restaurant is nice once you get inside. The garlic prawns are so good and I always order them.  The coconut lemongrass soup is real tasty.  The duck is super tasty too. You just can't go wrong here. Make sure to get reservations or get there when they open and they'll accommodate your party.  My Vegas trips are enhanced after visiting Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"I had read that this was the best Thai food in North America. That is saying A LOT, so I went in trying not to have super high expectations because I knew I would probably just be disappointed.

I was sooo wrong. This place is AMAZING, and most definitely is, the BEST THAI FOOD IN NORTH AMERICA.

There is a caveat though. We went for dinner on Friday night, and that was the night it was the best Thai food ever. Went again on Monday for lunch, and it was only standard/good Thai food. I don't know if they have different cooks in the kitchen, or if we just ordered the wrong stuff on Monday, but it definitely wasn't as good.

Here are some dishes I'd highly suggest ordering:

-drunken shrimp with noodles underneath -- this was the dish my sister exclaimed she would talk about if she were on the show \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" haha. enough said?
-green curry
-fried red snapper 
-they had a veggie dish with fried pork belly. the fried pork belly was DELICIOUS.
-fried banana with coconut ice cream and sticky rice -- THIS IS A MUST ORDER!!! Trust.
-thai tea -- It inexplicably tastes fresher and higher quality that thai tea at other places...

This is going to be a regular stop on future Vegas trips for sure. I can't believe it took me this long to discover it! But I'm so glad I did! =)"}
{"text":"One of the older Thai places in town and it is very good!  A popular lunch buffet spot as well!"}
{"text":"This is the Las Vegas hidden gem of Thai Food.  I had the Chilean Bass Drunken Noodles which was cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully. When you come you must order off the Northern Thai part off the menu and/or Chef's choice because that is their speciality. The garlic prawns my sister-law order were incredible and piled a mile high we had to take the rest home. My brother had the crispy duck khao soi and this is the second time he's ordered it. He basicly licked his plate clean. My brother was just promoted to Captain and this was the perfect place to celebrate his achievement!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE.  OH MY GOD.   So freaking good.  Their chicken panang is the perfect amount of spicy, their stuffed chicken wings are a gift from the gods, and their wine selection is extensive.  I seriously would consider going back to Vegas just to eat here again.

 It's a nice change to have employees seem to genuinely care about what you're feeling like, and then help you pick out your dishes, explaining the menu to you.  Our waiter told us to not get item A because we already were getting items B, C, and D.  Instead he suggested E, and he was completely right.  :)

I can't eat shrimp, but everyone else at my table LOVED the shrimp dish they got, so if you like shrimp, definitely try it!  (it was called Garlic Prawns)

And they made an off-the-menu dessert combo for us because we couldn't decide what to choose--so sweet!  The fried banana was delicious, and the perfect end to a fantastic and super-filling meal.

Also, we sat one table over from Jennifer Tilly, which was kind of weird.  She played on her iPad like the whole time LOL"}
{"text":"Place is great.  Had to wait about an hour but the food was well worth it.  Soups are great.  Will definitely be back. Nice break from the overpriced hotels on the strip.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Just go here! It's worth the taxi ride. I go multiple times when I am in Vegas. Don't let the neighborhood fool you! This is some of the best food on the strip!"}
{"text":"This is Thai food. 

If you:
Think Thai food should be eaten with Chopsticks
Think mild salsa is too \"spicy\"
Think Pad Thai is basically the only thing to eat at a Thai restaurant
Are driving 100's of miles to eat here, and are usually surrounded by lots of good Thai food choices

Don't come here.


No seriously.

 If you like Pad Thai, great but lets be honest- most places make pretty good Pad Thai, and it would be hard to make it better than most of the 4 million other restaurants. 

 
If you:
Really love authentic Thai Food
Are adventurous and want to try new things without going to Thailand 

This is the place to go.     

Lotus of Siam is really good, not only for the quality of the food but the variety on the menu. If you are a stickler for quality curry, and like when you can tell from the color of the curry how hot it is. This is your place."}
{"text":"There are two places in Las Vegas that I won't hesitate to venture far off the strip to eat at.  And this is one of them.  Nothing pretentious about this place.  They don't go overboard to try to dazzle your eyes to steer your attention away from what could be a miserable meal.  Although, I like the plainly stated design and layout of this place.  No out of work Vegas strip performers serving your meal here.  Seems like it is a family owned business.  And a big one too since there are a ton of waiters and waitresses to serve you.  No signature dish that everyone orders not because it is so good and everything else is only so-so.  Every dish at this place is good.  No need to ask the waiter for recommendation either.  Just look across the way at what is sure to be a packed house and ask what that person is eating.  It is guaranteed to taste better than it looks.  And best of all, no outrageous bill at the end of it all.

I have seen people visit Vegas from Thailand and they come here to eat.  Just think of the absurdity of that.  Every excursion to Vegas needs that memorable meal to set things off because everything else will be a nebulous memory, if done right.  And there is no better place for just that."}
{"text":"The food is over rated.  The only dish that worth 4 stars is the shrimp.  Everything else, you can have better choice in Vegas. 
btw, avoid the pai tai."}
{"text":"I'm here only to testify: my latest visit here reiterated and reenforced my belief this is the finest Thai restaurant in the country.  Had many of the same dishes I always do: beef salad with thai eggplant is so good it should not be missed by anyone!!!  And jackfruit curry (which I admit is more of an acquired taste,) which this time they made for me with shrimp even though it isn't on the menu.  Wait staff does rush you along a bit, but is very accommodating.  This time, I brought some more timid friends along who ordered more M-O-R Thai dishes: papaya salad, noodles, etc.; even for that stuff it was a cut above."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation.  Went in for lunch on whim not knowing there would be a buffet, which turned out to be fantastic food, even being on a buffet, and only 10 bucks.  Not a huge selection, which was actually nice.  What was there was fresh and warm and perfect and delicious.  Best Thai food I've had in LV so far.  Can't wait to go back for dinner and order a la carte.  Sweet and sour soup chronic. Pad thai exactly what it should be. Yellow curry chicken sweet with great seasoned backbone to it. Yumm-oh."}
{"text":"We can't come to Vegas without coming here.  The food is always good and perfect for the spicy food lover.  Many dishes can be modified if spice isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Unassuming restaurant off the Strip.  The food was amazing.  Three of us shared the garlic fried jumbo prawns (the shells can be eaten like chips and they were the best part of a great meal!), pork jerky, crispy rice, roasted duck curry (had bits of fruit which wonderfully balanced the spicy curry), curry rad nah, and coconut ice cream w sticky rice.

Every dish was good, with the garlic prawns and roasted duck curry as exceptional.  Bit pricey, nearly $30 a head for lunch, but so tasty that it is worth it.  Service was attentive and competent."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in LV. It is the best Thai Food. The menu is huge, diverse, and very flavorful. Be careful with the spices if you're sensitive. 
The wait is rarely as long as they say. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Solid thai.  Not sure that it's all that it's cracked up to be, but it is good.  Pad thai is not recommended, but I consider myself a pad thai snob."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.  My co-workers and I go here during lunch.  Each time, I am always satisfied.  Their chicken panang and chicken larb are very tasty."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I ever had. Will go back again for sure. I read some reviews that people wait for 4 hour for a table, so we went to around 9pm last night, it only took 15 min-20min waiting time"}
{"text":"Fairly good thai food but they don't really take reservations (they take phone reservations but its impossible to get through) and a lot of people came and left disappointed when we were waiting."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Neighborhood iffy then you walk into the restaurant and its beautiful and big and busy."}
{"text":"I thought good Thai food could only be found in NYC. I was wrong. This place is amazing.

Went here with a group of friends on a Saturday night - definitely suggest a reservation. The menu is extensive and has a Northern Thai section with dishes I haven't seen in any other thai restaurant. We tried a bunch of different appetizers and main dishes. All were perfect. Beware of the spice though - it's hot! The waiters will give you a choice of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 10.

Our flight home wasn't until 11pm on Monday. We went here for dinner again on Monday. Great way to end a great trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing---the best Thai food in the country.  I try to go here everytime I am in Las Vegas.  Try the papaya salad, the sa-tay and the Drunken Noodle Seafood.  Acutally try everything--I have never had a bad dish!!!"}
{"text":"So many people recommended this place, I had no choice but to go. Located about 3 miles off the strip in a somewhat shady and alarming strip mall- it does not disappoint. 

Clearly they have chosen to invest in their wine cellar and not their interior. At 70+ pages, with multiple vintages of highly sought after wines (Abreu, Schafer, Spottswoode and more), there is certainly a wine for everyone at every price point. 

Service was warm and accommodating. 

Food was OUT of this world!  I am a new Thai food fan. Green curry was luscious with great veggies and spice. Seabass with ginger was silky and flavorful.  We ordered the highly touted Garlic Prawns which I thought didn't nearly compare with the other two beautiful dishes.  

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my team on the last night of our conference. Those who have been here were raving about the place so I was pretty excited to finally eat here. It really did not disappoint. Every single dish we ordered was good. 
We had a party of 9 so we were able to sample a number of dishes. We ordered Nam Kao Tod - spicy crispy rice dish - definitely recommend this!
Tom Kah Khai - Chicken soup with coconut milk - I usually don't like this dish but I like the way they make it. 
Chicken larb - ground chicken dish
Pad Kee Mao - stir fried \"drunken\" noodles
Chili fried rice
Garlic prawn - shell-on deep fried shrimp
Crispy duck with Penang curry
Beef with string beans - can't remember the exact name of the dish
I liked every single item we ordered and will definitely try to make a trip there again when I go to Vegas. The only thing was - I feel like their portion is considerably smaller than other Thai restaurants. But the taste and quality definitely makes up for it. Reservations recommended for big groups. If you are travelling to Vegas for work, this offers more bang for the buck than eating on the strip."}
{"text":"Garlic Prawns? BFD. Papaya salad ok, nice heat. The other dishes were so-so. Talk about resting on your laurels,or banking on 4 star reviews. However I do enjoy the time machine decor. We felt hurried as well."}
{"text":"Long wait times but once you're seated, they are extremely quick to serve. 

We tried the beef jerky, Issan sausage, the northern specialty egg noodles with curry, the crispy duck in Penang curry, and the drunken noodles with garlic prawns. We also ordered the sticky rice, since we thought the dishes did not come with rice. 

Beef jerky: think warmed up thick beef jerky and serving it with a spicy sauce. Tasty but tough. 

Issan sausage: not enough caramelization, sausage filling was loose in the casing, and the lemongrass flavor dominated. 

Egg noodles curry: we mixed in the raw onions and the line juice. Tasty but it is basically curry sauce and egg noodles. Not much to get excited about. 

Crispy duck: delicious! Crispy, salty, savory, and slightly sweet from the coconut milk in the curry. Worth getting this dish! ! ! 

Drunken noodles: okay, maybe it was my mistake thinking that since this is a noodle dish, noodles would be a good portion of it. Nope. It was mainly the prawns. . .which is generous but I really wanted the flat rice noodles! 

Sticky rice: strange enough, they actually placed a huge bowl of regular long grained rice on the table. Then we were also given little containers of sticky rice that was hard, too chewy, and hard to eat compared to the long grained rice. It would have been good the waiter to ask if we really needed both as we misunderstood the menu where it clearly states rice is not included followed by the note that sticky rice is $2.50 a person. Annoying.

For four people, it was $125 with tip, so not too bad. Totally shady area but worth heading out if you rented a car!"}
{"text":"This place is perfection. The shrimp appetizer, drunken noodles... YUM. Anything you order will be spectacular.  As you can see I live his place. Top 3 places to eat in the US!"}
{"text":"believe the hype!!! thank you, that is all.

jk... but seriously, this place is realllllly good.  YOU MUST GET THE GARLIC PRAWNS AND CRISPY DUCK WITH PANANG.  We had other dishes - papaya salad, green chili dip, and a soup noodle i can't remember the name of and a couple thai teas & coffees.  Everything was what thai food is suppose to be - sweet, spicy, salty and sour.   Uhhhg SO GOOD!  We went here with my family for lunch and wanted to go back for dinner in the same day."}
{"text":"Now this is what god intended when he created Lotus of Siam.  The food here is to die for.  My husband is Asian,so we eat a lot os Asian inspired food, but this place is high above the rest.  Actually, the yellow curry with chicken, and this broth, oh were having Lotus of Siam for dinner.  hmmmmmm, I can't wait, maybe i'll get the pineapple fried rice, with everything in it, and the potsticker, oooooohhhhhhh so good."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing, its the best Thai I've ever had. The crispy duck is a must have. So sad I'm leaving Vegas tmrw.


Strongly recommend to come early (like before 6 pm)
The waiting time can be as long as 2 hours!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the hype. I wonder if the positive reviews are from reviewbots. Curries were water.  Meat?  What meat?  We left this place to get a burger because we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Bomb Thai food! No mango sticky rice (my cousin wanted). 
Luckily they made a reservation! Line out the door! 
Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I intended to make reservations for dinner and called the restaurant 10+ times over two days before they answered. Come to find out they are booked out about 3 weeks for dinner reservations. Definitely go for lunch! They open at 11:30am and if you get there before noon you probably won't have to wait. We took a cab from the middle of the strip to the restaurant before flying out (cab ride was about $20) for lunch. We were in and out of the restaurant in a half hour! Service was incredibly efficient and nice; after ordering, the food came out in about 5 minutes. As many other people said, the portions are a bit smaller than other Thai/Chinese restaurants but the quality is incredible. We had chicken pad thai and chicken panang (curry) and both were incredible. Hands down both dishes were the best we had ever had. I ordered the curry as a '6' on a scale of 1-10 of spiciness and it was delicious!"}

{"text":"Nothing tasted really great.  We took all the dishes recommended and more.  Pad thai, the most traditional dish, was really not good at all.  The shrimp everyone talks about were average, NOT worth $30.  I would skip this and try another place."}
{"text":"It's the best Thai food I've had. The pompano with the spicy thai chili was really good. I try to order a different item every time I go and everything that I had was good. The shrimp with bacon appetizer is la bomba and the softshell crab drunken noodles is out of this world.

MUST make a reservation!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there out of curiosity to find out what's special- why a lot more were raving about and just to check the place...and we ended up eating lunch as they were serving buffet. 

Service was polite and friendly. As soon as we entered they greeted us at the entrance and offered us a table.They sat us near the wine cellar and after a few minutes this place was almost full. 

The food was good and flavorful. They have a great lady chef constantly refilling the buffet line and checking the customers' needs.

Servers were very attentive in checking up on us if there's anything we needed and clearing our used plates. 

Both the food and service is excellent in my book."}
{"text":"Had the garlic prawns, they were good.  Red curry was ok.

Service good

But not all that people make it out to be!"}
{"text":"We spent a long weekend in Vegas and made a point to have lunch here our last day based on Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed!! Ordered the crispy duck Panang and grilled prawns in garlic sauce.  Prawns were good, but seemed more like an appetizer than an entree (entree size, but finger food).  Duck was delicious!  Next time will come back and try khao soi, pad thai, and green curry.  Recommend taking a taxi.  We took monorail from MGM to Sahara and then a cab.  Next time would just take a taxi."}
{"text":"YUM!  My husband and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend in September.  We were driving down to the strip on Saturday night when we spotted a strip mall full of different restaurants to pick from (Japanese, Korean BBQ, and Mexican).

I'm kicking myself but I cannot remember the name of the dish that I ordered.  It was a chicken and jack fruit dish.  (The veggies were described as being artichoke like.)  I gobbled down all my food and was sad there wasn't more of it.  

The next time I go to Vegas, I'm stopping by to order something else off of the gigantic menu.

{"text":"Great restaurant just north of the strip.  Got the chicken khoa soi and it was good, just not as spicy as I had asked.  The cucumber salad was delicious.  The pad se-ew was good as well.  The kang renu nak was okay.  We prefer a curry with coconut milk.  The Thai food at this restaurant was good.  I'm only dishing out 4 stars because I asked for a spicy 10 but got maybe a 6.  Overall though, it was still a good meal and I would bring other friends here."}
{"text":"Back again. One of the must-eat restaurants that you should do yourself the favor of leaving the casinos for when you are in Las Vegas. I recommend the garlic shrimp, crab fried rice, and anything with duck in it. The new digs are super swank."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant while we were visiting Vegas based on the yelp reviews it has. Yelpers, you have come through again! We were tired of eating on the strip and wanted something different that wasn't going to break the bank. Since we both love Thai food, we chose to give this place a go. 

When you pull up, the area seems kind of sketchy as the restaurant is located in a seemingly dead strip mall with limited lighting. When you enter, it looks as if it's going to be a tiny hole in the wall type place, but we were so surprised at how spacious the restaurant really is when the hostess showed us to our seats. Be advised, you will not be the only person thinking to dine here, especially on the weekend. We arrived around 6 on a Sunday and the restaurant was nearly full, with them opening just a half hour earlier. 

The service was awesome! Servers were so attentive and friendly but not overbearing or annoying. They gave us ample time to look over the menu and as soon as we were ready, someone was paying attention and ready to come take our order. We ordered Thai iced teas, shrimp tempura appetizer, and shared a Massaman curry. Everything was delicious. If we lived in Vegas, I'm sure this would be a regular for us."}
{"text":"We decided to venture off the strip for dinner. The wait was only an hour and the link they text you is pretty great. You can check where you are in line in case you leave. 

We went to the bar to get some drinks but there was only 1 person helping the whole restaurant. We waited 10 minutes and then left. No drinks.

For appetizers-- Stuffed chicken wings and Nam Kao tod. Both were delicious and would definitely recommend. 
For entrees- Khao Soi with duck and Kang Hung Lay. I really enjoyed the Khao Soi, but wished I had tried with the chicken instead. But the hubby liked the duck. The Kang Hung (I think this was the name) was very yummy and tender.
For dessert- had the Fried bananas with coconut ice cream. 

I would definitely return and try other things on the menu, but preferably with a larger group so that we could have multiple things. I would also recommend to eat in the larger dining rooms, we were put in the small one and it was too loud. I had to yell to talk to my hubby. 

Also, the staff was very nice and they were very attentive."}
{"text":"It might not look like much from outside, but inside the restaurant is beautiful. We sat at the bar for a few drinks and appetizers first. We waited only 20 min for a table without reservations. The service was great and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Make sure you come early or make an reservation 
The line can get pretty long 
Food is extremely tasty  
It will be good if you can have at least 4 people coming here
so you can order more dishes and try it 
I will come back again next time when I visit Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great service but wait cd be long without reservation. Love the wine selection and they're big with German Reisling which I really enjoy . Will definitely come again and savor thei excellent food"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. It's out of the way, in a run down strip mall. They don't take reservations, so it's usually an hour wait. Yes, the food is that good. And the prices are very reasonable. For what it would cost for one person (on the Strip), I can buy dinner for four. I look forward to going back there every time I'm in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, this time they were out of my favorite dessert - Sticky Rice with Mango."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food restaurants I have tried. The garlic prawns are amazing! Also recommend their chili mussels! Everything I have tried here were delish"}
{"text":"Went there 11/10/15 with big group. Hidden secrete!! Best food ever! 2 enthusiastic  would recommend to everyone to try! Off strip but well worth it plus don't be scared by dumpy outside look, inside its classy and welcoming! Service is fantastic & helpful. Will alway dine there when in the area. Thank you Jeff Howell for the suggestion. You always get it right!"}
{"text":"If you have not been to LOS you shouldn't be writing reviews on here and if you've
been and not gave it 5 stars you get no street cred 

App: Nam prig Ong very unassuming but very addicting  It goes very hard 

Main course: The drunken soft shell crab is a mind blower a straight up show                 stopper 

Dessert: The fried banana is lights out  

Never ever disappoints 
Call a day ahead 
Thai ice tea is a must

FIVE STARS with a BULLET"}
{"text":"Very authenic Thai cruise, one of the best tasting food! Very very spicy though, even after we ordered mild. I recommend the crispy duck 5 stars. Very fresh sea bass (although the portion was tiny) 4 stars. The beef and potatos in the curry was beyond tender and melts in your mouth 4.5 stars! The spicy sausage didn't really do it for me 2 stars. It was a bit spicy and dry. Overall, the experience was fantastic. Definitely a gem in the off vegas strip. I would prefer this over any buffet type food anyday."}
{"text":"Really authentic Thai food! Got the recommendation from the parent of one of my students and when I first arrived at parking lot I was a little skeptical but once you walk through the doors, you're greeted with a nice atmosphere and decor. We were probably lucky to go for a late lunch because we didn't have to wait for a table. The food was delicious! Don't really remember the actual name but the fried whole fish with the sweet and sour sauce was really yummy. Would eat here again the next time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food as usual was delicious. My favorite dish is the fried bass with drunken noodles. The fish is boneless, sliced in to strips and fried to perfection. Perfect with the side of drunken noodles. The tom yum soup was not very good tonight. It normally is spot on. This place is always so packed, the service lacks. You should definitely make reservations if you go. 

One issue I have with this place is the neighborhood it's in. There are lots of panhandlers here and it never fails that I get hit up for money. I just don't feel safe leaving here after dinner alone. Definitely go with company! Aside from that, you can expect good thai food. :)"}
{"text":"Good food,good price but not large quantities of food. I dig it though."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  Wow was I impressed with Siam's food.  So I'm a big fan of thai food, in particular their curries.  I've tried quite a bit of different curries from many thai food restaurants and this one definitely is at the top of the list.  I had the yellow chicken curry with a spicy request rating of 8 and boy did it kick my ass!  This is really the first thai curry I've tried that I can say is truly spicy.  Besides the spicyness, the curry was very flavorful which also made it fantastic.  I also tried their sticky rice and pad thai which were both very well made as well.  Their service was excellent and prices were very fair.  I couldn't really ask for more.

I'll be sure to return here on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Over Rated & Over Priced!!!  Being Thai and having ate at numerous Thai Restaurants, the food quality was poor 2/10.  The service was good though 8/10.  Hope this review will save you time & money!"}
{"text":"FLAVOR, SEASONING, AND SPICE....BELIEVE THE HYPE.

We ordered the (1) Sea Bass Drunkin Noodles ($29) and (2) Nam Prik Ong ($9) and an appetizer that was rolled in bacon and deep fried.  

The entrees were fantastic (although the Sea Bass was overpriced).  Some of the best thai flavors I have eaten outside of Bangkok.  The menu is amazing.  

Living next to Little Cambodia in Long Beach, I am really worried that Lotus of Siam has set too high of a bar for other Thai places to match.  This place may have ruined me.

We went on a Sunday night and although it is a huge restaurant, it was packed with locals (45 min wait, but they have a bar at which to wait).  The location is as random as it gets, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"my b/f took me here for lunch one day.  i'd never been before.  i love Thai food, and after reading all of the reviews on the wall, i couldn't wait to eat.  

fortunately, we deviated from the standard buffet menu.  the buffet looked boring--like Thai/pan-Asian 101 for clueless americans.  we both ordered from the Northern Thai specialty menu in the very back of the menu.  

FOOD--beef jerky: yummy.  i have no idea how they make it so moist!  i probably don't want to know... i think another reviewer said it was deep fried?  but it's good.  nothing as phenomenal as the pork dish described below, but still an experience in taste and texture.  

FOOD--fish cakes: i guess they're ok.  my b/f LOVES them, says they're better than any he's ever had.  as for me, it's food so i'll eat it but nothing to write home about.  

FOOD--Jack Fruit with Chicken: i'm not a huge pork eater, and i'm always a little suspicious of eating seafood in the middle of the desert.  could be just coast snobbery, but i just don't think seafood can be nearly as good a couple hundred miles from the sea.  anyway, i ordered the jack fruit with chicken dish.  i would have really liked the dish except i ordered it too spicy!  i said medium, but it was pretty darn hot.  even my b/f, who LOVES spicy food (he was in Thailand and even the Thais were impressed with the amount of hot peppers he consumed) thought it was pretty spicy.  not initially, but it crept up on you.  maybe b/c i'm asian they thought i meant medium Thai, not medium american.  

FOOD--Northern Thailand dry pork: my b/f ordered this dish 10 spicy.  even with the amount of heat, i tried a tiny, tiny bit of pork and i was blown away.   i don't mind heat so much as long as there is still flavor to the dish, and boy was this dish flavorful!!!!  omg, the tiny bit i tasted was phenomenal!!!  there was a warm, heady, complex spicy flavor that, had it not been 10 spicy, i would have devoured--even though i'm not a huge pork fan.  

we were unfortunately too full for dessert--i really wanted to try the mango and sticky rice.  next time, though, i will get my dessert.  

SERVICE: i thought the service was really quite excellent.  my water glass was always full--thank goodness!!!  and all of the staff made sure my b/f always had a full glass of diet coke.  he must have had 5 diet cokes while we were there--no joke.  he needed it, the food was really hot!  we were there over lunch, so while everyone else was going for the buffet, we were getting great treatment.  maybe it's different at dinner.  

oh, and the wait was reasonable.  i think we waited 15-20 minutes?  

DECOR: who the hell cares???  the food is amazing!  actually, i kind of like hole-in-the-wall places, especially in vegas where everything is so manufactured and shiny.  i feel more like i've discovered a little gem than when i'm in a fancy restaurant.  and the past few times we've gone to the fancy places, i haven't been so impressed with the food.  and i didn't think the decor is so bad.  not \"romantic\" by any means, but what kind of person would you rather date???  someone who cares only about external appearances, or someone who appreciates the quality on the inside???  

NEIGHBORHOOD: i was only there for lunch, but i've been near there at night before and have never felt unsafe.  then again, i lived in new york for three years and used to walk the streets of paris at 3am.  maybe i'm too blase about the vegas \"ghetto\" to feel unsafe.  

all in all, be adventurous and either ask the waitstaff for a recommendation or go out on your own.  you won't be disappointed... unless you get the buffet.  honestly, just how amazing beyond words can green curry really be???  you can get standard Thai anywhere.  if you're going to go here, you might as well get something you can't get anywhere else (outside of Thailand)."}
{"text":"We went to the Lotus last night it was one of the best. Restaurants I've ever been to In My Life the service and the food was excellent"}
{"text":"Unless you go to Thailand, you will not get better Thai food than this.

Their duck curry is ridiculously amazing. There is no restaurant in the western or eastern hemisphere that serves a curry that is so delicious with such a crispy duck with fantastic flavor.

Other amazing items include the prawns (with the shell), the raw shrimp, pad thai, beef jerky appetizer thing, their banana ice cream dessert thing, and pretty much any other dish the servers recommend.

I have been here a total of 3 times and make it a point to eat here each and every time I am in Vegas.

This last time we had a party of 6, with alcohol, ate till we were stuffed, for $256 before tip. Completely reasonable. 

This place is casual, family friendly, bright, clean, has great service (considering it's an Asian restaurant), and I strongly suggest making a reservation. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Hands down best Thai in the state! Very authentic and a complete surprise when you walk in the door"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best meal ive ever had. The garlic shrimp is to die for. Weird location. But food is delicious. Cant wait to go back to Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"We usually go to a different Thai restaurant when we visit Las Vegas, but this time we decided to try a different place.  We were very excited to try Lotus of Siam after seeing great reviews on Yelp. 

We arrived here on a Sunday at ~7PM.  The wait was about 30 min, which was ok.  Then after we got seated, we had to wait for ~20 min to get our order taken.  We ordered Tom Yum Kai soup, Chicken Sa-Tay as an appetizer, yellow curry, and pad thai.  

After 30 min, the soup was finally served.  It tasted good, it was not hot.  It was warm.. but not HOT.  I need my soup HOT.  Then the sa-tay was served.  It was very good.  

It took them FOREVER to bring the main dishes.  The curry I thought was just average..   But the pad thai was excellent.  It might be the best pad thai I've ever had.  

So I agree that the food is very good here.  But I was not happy that we had to wait for so long to get the food.  I was really disappointed in the warm soup.  I will probably go back to the Thai restaurant we usually go to the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Updated 2/23/07:
We went last week for the lunch buffet -- what a tremendous disappointment! Their website says the buffet is served until 2:30, but when we arrived at 1:45, we noticed a sign in the window (dated 2003!) saying lunch ends at 2. The buffet was totally picked over, they didn't restock any of the interesting items, half of the trays were full of either non-thai food (tempura? egg-drop soup?) or filler (shrimp chips, fried wonton skins). One curry, one stir fry, one thai soup... and all of it lukewarm. The only salad was iceberg and miso dressing. Nobody every asked us if we wanted drinks, we had to beg for water refills. Avoid the lunch buffet at all costs.

Original (four star) Review 11/06:
All the reviews below that call this place \"the best Thai restaurant in the country\" are, frankly, doing this place a disservice. It's a creditable Thai restaurant, and they certainly serve some of the best Thai food I've had since San Francisco's Thep Phanom took its nosedive into mediocrity. Every dish we tried was tasty and properly balanced, the service was attentive and welcoming, and the menu's impressive in its diversity. And, of course, there's an undeniable pleasure of finding such a gem amid the underbelly of Old Vegas seediness.

But unless you've spent your life eating ketchup-y pad thai, Lotus of Siam is not going to change the way you think about Thai food. But that's not the point, nor should it be. If you go expecting a palate-altering experience at a trek-worthy temple of gastronomy, you'll certainly come away disappointed. Go, instead, hungry for a well-made, casual dinner in an atmosphere that couldn't be less \"Vegas\" if it tried."}
{"text":"Great Thai!!  In a weird ;location for such a great place, but worth ghetto area."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is in the ghetto. While on the parking lot I had a homeless man on a bicycle knock on my car window to ask me for money, but...who cares! This is simply the best food you will have. Once inside, the restaurant is nice enough, good wine selection to pair with the most delicious dishes. Every time I have been there, there's famous people eating dinner.

Pros: The best thai food second to none , cheap prices.

Cons: make a reservation in advance, hopefully days in advance because the place is small and it is always packed. You may get mugged on the parking lot, what a shame that such a spectacular place has such poor location."}
{"text":"A group of 9 went here for lunch on 1/22/18.  After an hour only four had received their food.  They offered 15% off for the inconvenience.   No one ever came to our table to apologize or tell us why our orders were not coming out.  Meanwhile dish after dish is going to all the other tables.  Never coming back.  I would choose no stars but am forced to select one."}
{"text":"I should have came here on an empty stomach in order to enjoy it better. Stupid me decides to eat at 4pm at a buffet, no less. Ugh. 

We ordered a tofu pad thai, freshly fried catfish {#64}, jackfruit curry with chicken, panang curry with shrimp and a bowl of rice. 

The servings are quite small. We were able to get by since a bunch of us were still quite full from our lunch earlier in the day. But, if we were ravishing starving, I hardly think an order of each, sans the fried catfish would be enough for us. 

The pad thai looked different from the normal pad thai I'm used to eating. They use a thinner clearer noodle and a darker sauce. It looked like it was severely stirred fried. Still had the pad thai taste and I enjoyed it very much. Just wished that there was much more of it. This was the tiniest of the entree's. 

The star of the show was our fried catfish. It was huge! We got several beady eye looks once it arrived to our table. Besides the great appearance, it didn't disappoint! It was fresh, meaty, and crispy to perfection! 

The service in the beginning was a bit slow, but once we ordered, it got better. They had a person dedicated to just refilling water and he was dam good at it, too! Never did we have an empty glass. 

I would definitely return to this Thai establishment. Would I call it THE BEST? Eh... perhaps not. I have to say that their food is fresh; doesn't taste as though it's been sitting all day in the kitchen like most Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had.  The strip mall and interior are average, and the service was ordinary, but the menu options and the tastes were amazing.  Also features a world class wine list.  I'm not sure what pairs well with Thai food, but the wine list had hard to find bottles that were worth a visit all on their own."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype to this place. Food was average for Thai food, nothing particularly special. Service was average as well. We ordered tom yum, combination fried rice, and curry. All were edible but nothing particularly stood out in the meal. The flavors and spices seem to be tamed downed to fit the locals palate. If you are looking for truly authentic Thai food I would go somewhere else. If you are not usually an adventurous eater and looking for an \"intro\" to Thai food, this place will suffice."}
{"text":"This was just awful, not as touted. Maybe should have ordered something not so pedestrian. Egg rolls were so ordinary, pad Thai was gooey and gummy, tasteless, fired catfish was greasy. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Vegas, with a decent price.  Wait I take it back, Milos was pretty good too (at the Cosmopolitan).  Anyhow, the bf is allergic to shrimp and will eat their famous fried prawns (it was really large white shrimp, NOT prawns FYI).  HA.  Hives?  What hives...?  We are partial with green curry...though I have yet to have BAD green curry.  Very solid place."}
{"text":"All this and more.  It is always a delight to find the borderline sketchy strip shopping center and (from the outside) non-descript family-run restaurant that, upon entering, immediately informs of an otherworldy food experience.  Literally thought we had the wrong place at the door then walked in on a packed, multi room place buzzing with activity and chatter and one wall lined with a cellar containing nearly 50% Rieslings.  Settled on a moderately priced Mosel that beautifully married with whole roasted pompano and spicy sweet sauce, preceded by beef salad and pork apps.  First place for chow on return visit to LV."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai restaurant. I would eat here again. I had the dumpling special & Salmon special. A colleague recommended this place & I am recommending it to others :-D"}
{"text":"This was the second time for us at Lotus of Siam and we tried the lunch buffet.
The lunch buffet was nothing special, the dishes that was available was on the cheap side like steam rice, salad, sliced oranges, fried wonton, fried rice, etc. Being from out of town, the first time we ate here was a couple of years ago and had fond memory of the food. We ordered a couple of side dishes with the buffet and yes it was good but  was really surprise on how little you get for the cost"}
{"text":"this place is hit or miss.  when it hits, it's the best Thai food in the country.  when it misses, you just waited 2 hours for something you could have gotten in any town in the country.  still good, but not the transcendent Zagat darling.  i got the larb a few months ago and it was one of the best things i ever ate.  i got it again a couple months later, totally different dish and only good.  the Reislings by the glass are a perfect pairing for the spicy, sality goodness it offers.  if you've never been here, then do so, be brave MAKE A RESERVATION, but have a realistic expectation.  it might completely blow your mind, but it might also be so so.  never bad, but worth the gamble because it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I always look forward to Lotus and start planning my meal days ahead.
As usual, I start with their Tom Ka Kai soup.  Only this time it wasn't quite up to 5-star deliciousness.  The chicken was a little dry and the soup was missing the depth of flavor that has always put it over the top for me in the past.
For other starters, we had the Issan sausage that gets raves from other reviewers.  It was good, but not a new favorite.
The entrees were far better, with the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodles being my new favorite.  The fish was so perfectly cooked and buttery that I won't be able to return here without getting it every time.  We also had the Nua Nam Tok, which was one of their many charbroiled beef options.  They do a good job with their beef and it had a great flavor with lots of heat.
I do wish after all these years, the restaurant would improve its website.  The site has changed a few times, but it always seems to be hit or miss when I visit.  Stop with all the fancy stuff and just give me the basics: menu, hours, reservations.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Tried out Lotus of Siam because it had good reviews on CH and Yelp plus it was on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Vegas show that we just watched before coming here.

Maybe reservations by phone a few weeks before coming here.  That was easy to do.  Ask them for the cross street, because if you have a dinner reservation it's hard to find the place!

Everyone says to get the Northern Thai dishes at LOS.  So we tried a few things:

Khao Soi $10.95 - egg noodle curry soup.  We thought it was just ok, nothing special.
Some red onions, pickles, lime on the side.

Kang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.

Northern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.

Sticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.

Thai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.

Hot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w/ tea bag, nothing special.

Glad I tried it, but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wasn't able to try the food
After waiting for 15 min for service, we left!"}
{"text":"Got there 5pm, first in line, before their 530 opening.  Heard the hype, super high expectations...and it far exceeded!!

Awesome service, Food came out quick. Favorite dish was crispy duck pending curry, to die for. Almost got killed by a bus in the parking lot but worth the wait. 

Seabass was also very good. Garlic prawns, that shit was good. Papaya salad was awesome, but the portions were small. For four people, I recommend ordering two of them."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in an unsuspecting strip mall off the Vegas strip.

My coworker took me here as he had been many times. I will definitely come back next time in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Good food, not sure about the \"best\". We had the pad thai, the #55 with beef, and coconut egg noddle soup. Everything had good flavor and service was excellent. Would return here on next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Drunken noodles are the best. I've been to Thailand and this was just as good or better!"}
{"text":"Throughout our trip in Vegas, I encountered cab drivers of all kinds. Nevada natives, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian ex-pats and a fiery Argentinian abuelita [although she didn't look a day over 50] were some of the most memorable faces.

Yet our driver on our trip to Lotus of Siam,  with whom I built the strongest rapport, was the most interesting of them all. Ironically, he was himself, Thai, and a former restauranteur in Las Vegas proper. We spoke of thai dishes, international travel and our mutual distaste for pad thai sauce in a bottle.

At some point during our dialogue, I asked the lingering question, \"So...is Lotus of Siam REALLY as good as they say it is? Is it the best Thai restaurant in the country?\" To this, he replied with a simple shake of his head and a \"No\". \"If you want good Thai food, go to Thai Town in Hollywood.\" He clarified.

I am grateful to this man for lowering my expectations of Lotus of Siam, it's never a good idea to go into a restaurant experience believing that the food should be the \"BEST\" -- a recipe for disaster. So with a newly acquired, down-2-earth perspective, I entered the packed Lotus of Siam and prepared for a memorable experience.

Ambiance:

After the Travel Channel stakes claim to a restaurant, one of two things are bound to happen. Either the restaurant will cling to or completely abandon it's former character in the face of extreme \"over-night\" popularity. Fortunately, it seems that Lotus of Siam, while extremely crowded, has apparently retained most of it's pre-celebrity essence.

It looks like...well...a family-run Thai restaurant. The only difference was an entry w/o standing room, a policy that reservations are lost after 5 minutes of seating time [if a \"no-show\"], and an elaborate walk-in wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant.

Food:

The Pad See Ew, Fried Rice and Mint Chicken where all winners; but the two dishes which stood out in my mind where the Garlic Prawns and Jackfruit Curry.

Garlic Prawns: Full prawns, shells included, which where completely edible from head to tail. Crispy, moist and über flavorful.

Thum Ka Noon: This northern-style, non-coconut milk curry is made with young jackfruit and shredded dried fish. The curry broth was like none I had ever tried. It was a fan-favorite around the table for dipping, showering over rice or straight up slurping!

So...who was right? Andrew Zimmern or my Thai cab driver? Is this really the best Thai food in the country? Clearly I am not qualified to answer this question. Yet, I can assert that the food was quite memorable and some of the best Thai food I have had to date. Additionally, their unique specialization of Northern Thai cuisine is hard to come by outside of Chiang Mai."}
{"text":"This review probably would have been higher if I didn't have to wait Two hours to sit and eat!!! You will need to reserve a table a few days before to have a better experience. I know what you're thinking, who in their right mind would wait that long to eat... 

Me! I've heard great things about this place and recently read an article that Lotus of Siam was one of the top 10 Thai Restaurants in the USA! So I had to try.. 

We got the usual order, Pad Thai, Chicken Curry and Basil Fried Rice. All three were really good but not worth the wait. I should have tried their more exotic options on the menu like the crispy duck curry... maybe next time."}
{"text":"First time we ordered, we got an assortment of little original Thai Dishes. Each was delicious, albeit small. 

Second time we went there we ordered from the Northern Thailand menu, and it was, well... OK. Not sure great, still small servings, but not great. 

So we're tentatively fans, but may need to downgrade later when we go again.

The wait here can be horrendously long. Come on weeknights right before the open to get seats quickly."}
{"text":"This was a great splurge meal. I came here to celebrate a while back and the meal was amazing. I had the crispy duck drunken noodles and the soft shell crab. So good. The service was great- friendly and helpful. The wait wasn't very long and it was packed. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was just OK for my taste.  We went there for lunch and it was crowded.  And the waiters were just rushing everything, obviously, we felt rushed as well."}
{"text":"In trips to Vegas, I've been fortunate enough to do the sixteen-course degustation at Joel Robuchon, dinners at places such as Picasso, Alex, Nobu, L'Atelier, Wing Lei, SW, etc.

Yet, the most delicious meal I've ever had in Vegas was at Lotus of Siam.

First thing to know: this is really three restaurants in one.

#1, there's a lunch buffet where rubes come in and pay $7.50 to eat potstickers and egg rolls.  Pretend this doesn't exist.

#2, there's a normal Thai menu with stuff like phad thai and panang curry.  While this stuff is good, it's not unlike what you might eat at a good Thai restaurant in Seattle or San Francisco or New York.

#3, there's a section of the menu with Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Special dishes.  This is the heart of the menu and what makes foodies cry with delight.  If you're coming all the way here (and it's a long walk from the middle of the strip), you must order off of these sections of the menu.

We've been here several times.  Most recently, we had the dry sausage, a green curry dip, and finally the special Beef Stew with peppercorn sauce (option A I think.)

While all of these are highly recommended, the beef stew was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  The meat was absolutely fork tender, flavored with aromatic and perfectly balanced Thai spices--the right mix of sweet and spicy and pungent.  Just amazing.  Totally beyond the flavors and textures you expect.

They grow a lot of their own herbs and spices because they're not available outside of Thailand.  As a result, you'll taste flavors and combinations you've probably not had before.

Again, order off of the Northern Thai or Chef's menus.  And prepare to be amazed."}
{"text":"We waited 75 minutes for a table. We ordered three items. After we finished two, the waiter came to tell us that they were out of ingredients. They could have told us at the beginning. The portion of foods were little. I have been to numerous Thai restaurants in the country and the world, this place is just average. Sorry to disappoint you, those who rated this place as \"The best Thai restaurant in the country\". Obviously,  you have no clue. The food were not bad, but not \" the best\". The reservation system is a failure.  It should be first come, first serve like any other Asian restaurants, so many emptied seats and long line of customers. Totally overrated and exaggerated.  If you really want to throw your money away, be my guest. Otherwise, I'm sure you can find other Thai restaurants in Chinatown that has the same foods."}
{"text":"Long wait but I guess that is indicative of the demand. Had the stuffed chicken wings and garlic prongs (shrimp) ... Not bad."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had!

Based on the recommendation of a cabbie, we drove north to Lotus of Siam.  We shared two dishes, the Chef's Special Sea Bass with veggies, spices and wide flat noodles and Panang Curry Chicken.  I ordered the Panang with wide flat noodles as I prefer the noodles over rice with some dishes.

Anyway - WOW!  The food was fantastic and worth the drive off the strip on the north side of town.

We arrived around 1:30 pm for lunch.  They were still busy.  I'll admit that service was slow.  The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Cost was maybe a tad on the high side but we both felt the food quality was worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. We had the drunken noodles with shrimp, green curry with tofu, and the crispy rice appetizer. The service was excellent and very friendly."}
{"text":"My family just drove in and we were looking forward to some good Thai food.  We ordered the drunken noodles with prawns and the chicken fried rice to share.  The prawns were good but the drunken noodles were sober and dry.  It was all clumped together with barely any sauce.  The fried rice was decent but the portion you get for $10+ is ridiculous.  Barely enough to share amongst my 5 and 4 yr old.  A place this pricey and so highly reviewed needs to stay consistent.  Not going to be back."}
{"text":"Recommended to us by Delmonico's sommelier! Enough said - we went the next day for lunch. Off the strip, it was well priced, compared to prices on the strip. Highly recommend NAM KAO TOD. I'd definitely go back again and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, we were there right when it opened and it was packed, took awhile to get a table but well worth the wait.  Had the crispy duck and I've been craving more ever since, a must try while in Las Vegas, don't be fooled by the storefront, you go inside and it's beautiful"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! Always hit this spot when I'm in the area... I missed it last time because the roof caved in and they were closed for awhile lol. This place is always packed though and it's for a reason... it's a good thing it's not the easiest place to find because it'd be more packed!"}
{"text":"pretty good food, gets very busy but didn't have to wait long, nice wine selection, and ran into Jim Belushi there.."}
{"text":"wow
eat here! this is a must for any traditional thai food lover.
papaya salad, green curry, drunken noodle prawn best I have ever had. EVER."}
{"text":"This is not only the best food I have ever had but also the most amazing service. Every bite of food was flavorful. The servers did great at recommending items to try and they did not disappoint. We ordered the fried rice (most flavorful) and stuffed chicken wings, Pad Thai, along with the famous garlic shrimp. The shrimp skin was even edible like a potato chip! We ended the meal with fried bananas which were also delicious. I was so full by then but they were so good I couldn't help but finish the dessert. Highly recommend this place! Keep in mind reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular Thai food. Went to Lotus 2x on my most recent Vegas adventure. Soft shell crab house special and raw shrimp entree were two highlights. Every dish is well executed. Don't skip wine. The Riesling selection is deep and complements the food well."}
{"text":"We were so excited to finally come have a meal at Lotus Siam and our excitement was quickly dashed into disappointment.  We started with the papaya salad and the only thing to say is it was just an average salad.  The papaya could have been cut thinner to be more delicate.  Then the garlic prawns were pretty greasy and tasteless as well as the crispy duck with chili mint sauce, and not at all crispy.  

Do yourself a favor and don't be tempted to eat here. If this restaurant was in NY or LA, it would not last 3 months.   In addition, the location is further insulting because the food was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands-down a great Thai food experience super large restaurant great for small parties company venues. James Beard award winner Zagat award winner. Authentic dishes flavors and spices"}
{"text":"Service was excellent; ordered chicken with basil and chilis; green papaya salad and seafood spagetti.  Stir fried chicken with basil was really excellent.  The papaya salad was incredibly small for the $9 price.  Really, the restaurant can do better.  Spagetti was so-so.  But, I can see why the restaurant has a lot of fans.  We arrived before Monday night opening, and there was already a line.  Wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Our recent lunch trip to Lotus was fine, not great, not bad, but fine. 

Both ordered off of the menu, shipped the buffet. The catfish soup had a nice flavor. The pork larb salad was nothing to write home about.

This was the first Asian restaurant I've been to where you get charged for a refill of hot tea. Oh well.

The wine selection looked extensive and the restaurant was bustling."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.We came for dinner,about 10 minutes before it opened,and there was already a long queue there.

The food is good,we ordered garlic prawns,green curry with beef,fried sea bass with sweet and sour sauce.I highly recommend the green curry,always my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm not insane over Thai food. I like it just fine but I'm no aficionado. On a trip out here a few months ago, one of the folks in our party really wanted to go here so we ate here the first night in Vegas. I was looking forward to it based on the reviews but it wasn't anything like, \"OMG I'm dying to try it.\" Well, now I am OMG dying to go back. The meal was out of sight. Best Thai food I've ever had. We ordered a few dishes and sampled a bunch. I think you could just blindfold yourself and point to something and it would be incredible no matter what you got. This place deserves the rave reviews it gets. And it is now going to be one of my must-dos when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the one. I mean the #1. Like the best Thai I have ever had. Saw a review from someone complaining about the pad Thai or something.....really?  You visit a Michelin star rated restaurant and order a dish you can get at every Thai restaurant in America?

They have so many super unique dishes I would really suggest asking a waiter for help because they are really helpful and knowledgeable. I had the crispy duck in the parang curry and it was unreal good.  Can't remember the other two dishes by name but the flavors with wonderful.

Trust me the wait is worth it. You won't get this kind of food on the strip"}
{"text":"FOOD: decent, but portions are very SMALL
Price: a bit pricey for Thai food, but not thaaat bad considering it's food in VEGAS
SERVICE: decent
AMBIANCE: clean and spacious

* #3 spicy on the 1-10 scale= not spicy at all

- nam kao tod(crispy rice salad): decent, but a bit too soggy
- som tum(papaya salad): yummy, BUT the portion was surprisingly SMALL
- moo yang(bbq pork): decent but pricey for the amount you get
- sai gog isaan(Northern Thai sausage): decent
- kow soi(Northern Thai noodle soup): good portion, BUT weak in flavor. 
- goong gratiem prik thai(garlic and pepper prawns): VERY GOOOOOOOOOD! but for $21!??! hmmm...yeah I guess it's worth it. yum!
- gratiew leur(boot noodle soup): bland.

OVERALL: decent Authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey.  Interesting.  Um.  OMG.  Why?  Are you kidding me?!

Wait.  Is this a review?  Before you guys think I'm high or something.  See response below.....

This ain't Hangover 37.  It's Baby-Mooners.  Wife was nagging me about taking her with me on my business trip.  I know...I know...it's my problem.  Anyway.  Our friend had a wine dinner here the week before and some of the photos that they posted on FB were just plain sick.  (I'm talking about the wine).  I bet some of you reading this are thinking....Get to the fucking point!!!.  Ok ok ok.  Fine.  

Hey hey hey - We sit down and I ramble over the wine list.  Awesome Riesling list.  I ended up ordering the 1990 Auslese.  Just pure awesomeness for the first 45 mins.  Then I had to down it since my preggers wife couldn't drink with me.  

Interesting - Crispy Fried Rice.  I bet many of you think WTF are you doing ordering fly lice at a Thai restaurant.  We'll don't knock it till you try it.  Some may judge this dish as a garlic salty rice crispy treat?  Pretty bad comparison, but hey if you don't believe me go try it.  

Um - Crispy Shrimp.  At first bite, I didn't eat the shell.  The shrimp is de-veined and shell left on.  Then deep fried in a white pepper salt duo mixture.  Our waiter walked by and said...try the skin.  It's like popcorn shrimp.  The shell literally melts in your mouth.  I'm like whoa nellie shut the front door.   

O.M.G. - Crispy Duck Penang.  This dish is worth the price of admission.  This duck puts any Peking Duck to shame.  Even Ming Tsai's.  Sorry buddy.  You've been punked episode Duck is coming to fruition.  

Before our last dish arrived, I looked at my wife and asked her.  Why?  Why haven't we been here before?  

Are you kidding me? - Drunken noodles.  By this part of the meal, I've grossly over-eaten and feel like a hog ready to be pit roasted.  I think the secret ingredient in this dish is the Mekong River water they use to cook...oh wait....that's in Thailand where they use river water.  Nevermind.  And there's no mekong river in thailand.  Anyway...I'm almost 1000% sure she has her own private herb garden.  Cuz that basil is the shiznit.  

Well that's it for now.  Until next time...keep rubbing your eyes in jalapeno juice."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain recently featured Lotus of Siam on his TV show: thank you Mr. Bourdain! This place is great. Stellar food. Best pad thai I ever had. I had the pork khao soi, and adored it. It had very delicate egg noodles that I have to assume were created that same day, in a savory curry-ish broth. Our kids, usually picky eaters, loved the fried rice and satay. The location is a nightmare: this restaurant is found in a super sketchy strip mall off the Strip. I was really glad we went for an early meal and were able to leave before the sun set. The service was pleasant and efficient: they keep things moving. It was quite busy. We showed up without a reservation on a Tuesday night around 6 p.m. and were told it would be a 30 minute wait: instead, I opted to make a reservation for the next day, and there were very few open time slots. Great price tag at the end. I have spent way, way more in Vegas for way, way less. Do not pass up on this gem."}
{"text":"This place was just okay.  I feel like it didn't live up to the hype.  I went with the drunken noodles per the yelpers recommendations. It is a dish I am not experienced with, so maybe it just wasn't for me, but it was nothing special.  My wife had the pad thai with chicken which was okay but not great.  With all the rave reviews I was really hoping to be blown away.  The staff here was also suspect.  They seated us at the bar while we waited for a table but then didn't come to offer us any beverages.  I understand that it was near the end of the shift, but close the restaurant when it is closed, not when it is almost closed.  The bartender ignored us and just went about cleaning up his area.  Lame.  I would be willing to come back here and give this place another try, but I truly was let down this go around."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food. Service was friendly but the food was not to par. Definitely has a Chinese fusion rather than authentic thai food."}
{"text":"I am new to Thai food and I love it so much!!! Great food and great prices. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Good food, great ambience and always busy. I didn't visit this place for a while but all my prior experience was great. In commercial center which is not a great area but this restaurant is superb even in not  a so good location."}
{"text":"We were recommended this restaurant by a colleague who had heard about this restaurant that specializes in Northern Thai Cuisine. If you are visiting Vegas, invest in the cab ride out to Lotus of Siam because it is worth it! They have many dishes that you would not find at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, since there were only two of us, we were only able to partake of three dishes. One was the thai sausage (they have 2, we got the one in the back part of the menu). It was spiced unlike any other sausage we'd ever had and was very tasty. We ordered pork belly and chinese brocoli (gai lan) in oyster sauce. It was a simple dish made with very fresh ingredients. The last dish we tried was drunken noodle soft shelled crab. This dish was just very tasty. I had been concerned that the medium spicy sauce we had specified would overwhelm the crab, but it just complimented the crab perfectly. The service was terrific, relaxed, informative, and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. It was full, but it did not feel rushed. I take off one star because of the decor. Once inside, I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant with a huge wine room. That said, I would come back again and again to work my way through their menu."}
{"text":"We were able to get reservations for 7:30 on Saturday only a week or two before. The koi soy (beef tartare) was excellent, as was the the mashed jackfruit dish (very surprising!) and papaya salad (which is very spicy but quite authentic. The khao soi was all right but not amazing. The whole fried catfish with basil was great, and the northern larb was pretty good but again not exceptional. The wine list is truly something, and there are plenty of other drinks as well. Service is very good and friendly and the prices are not bad, especially for vegas."}
{"text":"Get soup. Share as many dishes as possible.  Crispy duck!"}
{"text":"We were so upset that the last time we came to Vegas the location off Sahara was closed. 

But when my wife went in yelp for Thai food and lotus of Siam cane up we were happy. But had to confirm it was the same place. Yes it was!!!

Had the garlic prawns, drunken noodles, and Penang curry. Mmmmmmn. For dessert the banana. Everything excellent with the right amount of heat a level 5. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Thai food or in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"Awesome! Make sure to try the appetizer with with bacon wrapped shrimp!! They have an extensive wine list from my wino's!"}
{"text":"We visited this place for Monday  lunch. Known to be the best Thai place in the nation, it was already pretty crowded.  got sat immediately. I'm not sure if they take reservation, but it doesn't hurt to call them to know whether they are busy or not. It is very well decorated place. They have a bigVery cozy and friendly , casual/ ambient atmosphere. It doesn't look fancy at all from the outside. Waiters and waitresses were really nice. We were expecting buffet for lunch but don't think they are doing that anymore. 
 They serve authentic Thai foods. I have always heard about this place and finally was able to try.  Foods are amazing and my favorite is their pad Thai and pad sea ew and their curry foods are amazing. They have so many variety of food mixed with noodles and curry. Remember it's authentic that they don't have strong flavor as Americanized Thai foods
1. Pad Thai  - 4/5: personally noodles were over cooked and not as flavorful
2. Pad sea eww  5/5: best dish we ordered that day. But it can be too mild. So make sure you choose yours wisely
3. Garlic prawn : 5/5  they were very generous with size of shrimp. It was really crispy. Waiter said it was their most popular dish
4. curry: very authentic. They do good job preparing the curry

Their dessert : mango sticky rice is so good too 
I'm definitely coming back for more experience in the future"}
{"text":"Get the crispy duck with panang sauce or ask them to do it with prawns. Sea bass drunken noodles was good and the pork stew was also amazing.  So good we went for dinner and went back for lunch 2 days later."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had. The northern dishes are great. The pad Thai noodles were great. The appetizers were great."}
{"text":"We came here a couple of times. Our first meal was beyond amazing. It was so good we went back the next day for lunch. We obviously wanted to try something different and it was a complete miss. The noodles were cold and stuck together. I eat Thai food all the time and those noodles were probably the worst of had compared to over 20 restaurant s that I've tried. It's definitely worth a trip but just only order what the waiter recommends."}
{"text":"Sea bass drunken noodles was AWESOME! It was so good I was sad I had to share. Tom yum soup with catfish was great too (I love catfish). We also tried a curry which was great, the papaya salad was good too (which was surprising because when it came out it didn't look too good, it wasn't thinly shaved like traditional papaya salad, but the flavors were excellent)
The nam kow (fried rice appetizer) was pretty good, but a little on the skimpy side, should have ordered two. 

But overall this was one of our most memorable meals in Vegas."}
{"text":"For some reason everyone wants to go here.  Been there a number of times.  In my humble opinion.... It's average.  Very bad location especially at night.

La Thai is far better!"}
{"text":"The dumplings here were delicious as was the duck and the satay.   I had expected the Pad Thai to be the same, lumpy rice noodle Pad Thai found at most Thai restaurants, but they elevated this dish several notches above your average place.  Wasn't sure what to expect when we turned up at the strip mall where this place is located, but it's well worth the trip.  Customer service was a plus: I jokingly mentioned something about being compensated for the inconvenience of being uprooted from our original table and was, in fact, served a Thai Ice Tea on the house.  I hadn't really expected or wanted anything, but they certainly made a point that customer service was on their mind.  I will visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food.  I mean, whatever is in the tips, just order those things."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Have been here a number of times. 

Grew up in Australia and was spoilt with such excellent Thai food! Coming to America is has been hard to find authentic, excellent Thai! BUT THIS IS AMAZING!

Best Thai I have had since moving over here 5 years ago. 

We ordered a variety of appetizers and mains- every single one knocks dit out of the park!!

Finished with the Mango Sticky Rice and it was superb!!

Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very cool old school vegas place! Food and service were both good. Restaurant is very bright is my only criticism. Would probly give it 4.5 stars if possible. Waiter gave recommendations and we took some. All the food was tasty from the satay to the pad Thai to the Panang. Great Thai food and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Thai, Northern Thai specifically, outside of Thailand. I straight up sang love songs to my food it was so damn good. Go there. Now."}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try even though we love china town. The Garlic prawns were great as an appetizer $26, I had the beef short ribs in red curry and my wife had the sea bass on papaya salad. There was only Apple on her papaya salad. I was still good though. We didn't feel this restaurant matched it's pricing or the hype. $110 for lunch, no liquor, no appetizers. If they marked everything down 50% we would probably go back.
 Try it if you like but for half price you can get great or better food in China town including 2 full body massages for less money!!"}
{"text":"Incredible Thai Food, top 3 ever.

I share the sadness that it is not always open when you need it.

After building up expectations about Ronald's Donuts, a group of us on a weekend vacation were disappointed to find out that some Europeans had come and snatched up all the correctly famous vegan cream filled donuts.

Thats ok, we will go to Lotus of Siam, and all will be good.   When we arrived to find it closed, that was very sad.

Luckily the thai place in the same shopping center is all vegetarian and fantastic.  Wow!

Ok, this review has nothing to do with Lotus of Siam.  Its just really good Thai food.  Go there."}
{"text":"We came here really late one evening and still waited about 20 minutes; and were glad that we did. We basically ordered the most popular dishes on the menu--garlic prawns, crispy duck, and some sautéed veggies. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, with a nicer atmosphere. A little pricey for the quality, but definitely good."}
{"text":"crispy rice salad was sooooooo good!!and the garlic prawns too!!came highly recommend by my parents and i am so glad we went here after our great trip to Vegas!would definitely come back here with my family and stuff our mouths ha ha"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Stuffed chicken wings were fantastic. It's in an odd shopping center, but don't let that fool you. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and great Thai food. One of the highest Thai restaurants in the Nation for a reason."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's not really a secret that this place exists, but I have to rave about it anyway!  If you haven't been to Lotus of Siam, you should treat yourself to the amazing menu.  Lotus of Siam is located on the east side of the strip, so its a drive for me, but I try to get there at least once a month.  

The Chicken Pad Thai is great (really, the whole menu is great, but this is one of my favorite dishes here).  The hospitality is always welcoming even when there is a waiting list."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is in a strip mall so don't expect great decor, but with the amazing food, who cares!  Be aware that the food is spiced on a Thai scale not an American scale so round down!  But I will come here every time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty. Try from the northern menu. Portions are medium sized. Lunch service may take a long time but it's worth it. Don't come here in a rush. Parking is very easy."}
{"text":"looked ghetto from the outside but when we ate here Thursday afternoon not even weekends and late night it was already packed! reservations is a must but they will only hold the table for 5 mins which makes sense! so here we go, food! we ordered Thai iced tea, pretty good but not free refill.. ordrered pad Thai, garlic crispy prawns, beef fried rice... the pad Thai is good but the serving is so little it's good for one person only! garlic crispy shrimp is the best. I can eat this all day... it's so good that even the shell of the shrimp, u can eat it. the beef fried rice is ok. little bit oily! the dining area is ok. old fashioned typical Asian resto. their walls are filled with pictures of celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Nicolas cage to name a few! they have a wine cellar inside.. it looks clean. kitchen is busy! fast service.. eat and go kinda of thing. the servers doesn't really say anything unless u order something. I felt rushed when we came coz we're waiting for some more people to come, they look like they are worried that ur gonna stay there for an hour! overall, good food but very pricey! for 5 dishes including 1 dessert and 3 Thai iced tea, our bill is a whopping 150$... I'm not even full.. but tasty! so 4 stars!!!"}
{"text":"1. khao soi with crispy duck was delicious. egg noodles were mixed in great curry sauce along with duck where the skin was extremely crispy
2. penang curry - standard coconut curry, delicious as well
3. garlic prawns were huge and fried, but garlic flavor was not as vibrant as expected
4. soft shelled crab drunken noodles were the wide rice noodles, good but not necessarily a must order
5. coconut ice cream with sticky rice was flavorful, but fried banana were like spring rolls, but with banana filling instead"}
{"text":"We love this place! Whenever my husband and I talk about Vegas we think of lotus of Siam. And they have a clever wait app/system."}
{"text":"Ok, so we showed up with no reservations.  Not a great idea, but it was early and they got us right in.  Dinner was on our table in less than 15 minutes.  Crispy Duck and Garlic Prawns what else can I say?  The food is always awesome at this place.  A tad bit pricey but well worth it for the quality you receive.  This place is always on my must do Vegas list."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Las Vegas! 
I have never had a bad dish and always been made to feel very welcomed. I can't get over the Drunken Noodle Prawn (it would be my last meal on earth if I had to chose) it's that good! 
They have Vegan options, GF options the most incredible wine list I've seen in Vegas and get this the price accordingly you don't feel like you're paying double the price for a bottle of good wine. 
They did not charge me ever for a bowl of plain noodles or fresh cut cucumbers for my son. I try to go at least once a month if 6 weeks goes by I'm itching to get in."}
{"text":"had my reservation last night, and boy was i looking forward to it for a long time due to all the hype. It did not disappoint. great, quick service. extremely tasty and authentic food. i just wish there wasn't such a long line to get in every time, or such a wait list to get a good reservation time, or else i'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"It was good but service was spotty and dishes are small. This place is tucked in a ghetto looking mall. Interior was nice with large selection of wine. Drunken noodle with soft shell crab was not all that. pad thai was good."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here three times over a span of four years. Food and the overall experience has been phenomenal every time. Shrimp dishes, lamb, all curries are just packed with flavor. They also have so many other unique appetizers and entrees which you dont see in your regular Thai restaurants. As some other reviewers have mentioned its a bit pricey but to me it was worth every penny. I am definitely going back the next time I am in Vegas. Reservations recommended or you may end up waiting 1-2 hours."}
{"text":"Read that this place is the best Thai restaurant in North America. Tried the food and it was incredible! True to its title. One of my most amazing meal EVER. Left the place speechless..."}
{"text":"This place serves pretty good thai food in my opinion.  The portions are a bit smaller than I expected.  The bright side to that is you get to try out other dishes.  I was in a rush so I did not really get to order all out at the time.  

There was a waiting line for 2 people on a Saturday at 9 PM.  The staff were friendly, but it took them a while to come our table to put in our order.  The place was busy at the time or maybe they were short on staff that night.  The inside was nice and clean.  There is a large wall of wine to choose from.  The prices are a bit more than I normally pay for thai food.  Two dishes, thai iced tea, tax, and tip ended up ~$30.

I ordered the beef noodle soup and the pineapple fried rice.  The beef noodle soup was pretty good.  It was spicy, but not too bad.  I normally don't like to eat spicy foods, but I was able to enjoy the noodle soup dish.  The pineapple fried rice had a hint of yellow curry, large chunks of pineapple, chicken, and shrimp.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  The thai iced tea was pretty good too.  

On the way out I saw a picture of Drew Barrymore on the wall.  I don't really like her movies, but at least she has pretty good taste in thai food.  Also a picture of Elvis was on the wall too.  Hey, if the food is good enough for the King, its good enough for me.

I do regret not ordering dessert.  I will definitely go back to this place and try out other items and get dessert.

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a great restaurant and I will be sure to visit whenever I go through Vegas. I will also be sure to make a reservation before the day I want to go (NOTE: they do not take same day reservations and the wait can be long). The food was fantastic but -1 star for small portions. We had to order more dishes than people which is unusual for a Thai restaurant in my experience. 

We followed other reviewers' advice and ordered garlic crispy prawns, crispy duck in choo chee curry, papaya salad, spicy chicken wings, and an eggplant dish. Everything was perfectly cooked and had authentic Thai flavors - i.e. good balance between sweet, salty, sour, and spicy. Be careful about spicy over-confidence :)"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 5 stars but one of the three dishes that I order were good but not excellent. Thanks to other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the Nam Kai Tod (crispy rice), Crispy Catfish with Apple, and Crispy duck with drunken noodles- note the \"Crispy\" theme here.  The first two dishes had so much flavor in one bite.  The Crispy Duck was good but the drunken noodles were so-so.  
There were so many enticing dishes on the menu but I did now have enough people to help me chow the food down.  These dishes will have to wait for me the next time I visit Vegas.  
 - Show up early for dinner if you want first seating. I visited this place on Saturday night, the door opened at 5:30PM, and all tables were filled by 6:00PM.
- If you want a pleasant dining experience, bring a big party with you so that you can explore more items on the menu and show up when the door opens."}
{"text":"One of the best thai places I've ever been to EVER! Doesn't look like much when you roll into it, but man...great stuff once you get in there. The restaurant has solid wine offerings, and a variety of beer/alcohol on top of the wine.

The only thing I regret about my venture to the Lotus was that I was slightly inebriated before showing up. I can't remember what I ate, but the Pad See-ew (sp?) was great! It's usually my go-to and standard for thai places, so this place definitely passes muster. My bro also got some kinda curry dish that was delish, but I have no clue what it was. 

Do yourself a favor and grab some grub there, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Really helpful staff in explaining the different dishes.   The most amazing Thai food menu I have ever seen.  Also great wine cellar."}
{"text":"Since I wont be back here for at least another year(unless by some fortunate stroke of luck) I figured I need to go ahead and write this review while its fresh on my mind.

Started off with a small bowl of Tom Ka Kai and a bottle of excellent Riesling.  I figured the Tom Ka Kai would be similar to the offerings in my home town given the simplicity of the ingredients, but LoS managed to even step that up....delicious.  For anyone who isn't familiar the soup consists of coconut milk, galanga, ginger, lime juice, chicken, mushrooms, fish sauce and a little black pepper.

Next up was the only dish I had eaten on my one prior trip here,  the Garlic Prawns.  These were just as good as I remembered.  Salty, sweet, crunch with a strong garlic and black pepper kick.  Shrimp were impeccably fresh and clean tasting.  Don't be scared of the fact that the shrimp shells are included......they literally turn to delicious crackers.

After eatings the prawns, which I already knew I loved, I actually expected to be let down my the following main courses, but I was pleasantly surprised.   We had our waiter, whose name I unfortunately can't remember(he was excellent), recommend us a signature dish and a noodle dish.  He recommended the Pad Se Eww for the noodles and Charbroiled Beef in a Young Peppercorn Sauce.  The former was excellent with perfectly cooked wide flat noodles, sweet/salty brown sauce and crunchy chinese broccoli.........but the Charbroiled beef was the thing of legends.  Beef cooked nicely medium with crunchy green beans and green bell pepper served with a savory brown sauce heavily flavored with the intensely vibrant and sharp taste of young peppercorns.  This makes for a unique and brilliant combination of flavors.

I can't state whether this is, as reviewed, the \"best Thai restaurant in North America\", but I think I can safely assume they make a VERY strong case.

**Note: Don't be scared to ask your server for recommendations.  Ordering \"tradition\" or plain jane Thai dishes here doesn't seem to be the way to go."}
{"text":"Came in with with high, albeit reserved, expectations from all the hype and my expectations were still exceeded. I like spicy food but avoid punishment, so a 6 or 7/10 spice level works for me. 

Koi Soi [Steak Tartar - Issan Style] and drunken noodles were good. 

Issan sausage, tom yum, tom ka, chix fried rice, musaman were as expected."}
{"text":"Just found my new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. Wow! Wow! Wow! My friend recently visited her friend in Vegas and her friend who lives here took her to this place. She couldn't stop talking about this place so we decided to come here last night. We came from Cali and got here around 9 pm. We had to wait 45 min because the restaurant was so packed. Around 9:45 pm, we were seated to our table. We knew what we wanted to order so the waiter took our order immediately. We ordered crispy garlic prawns, soft shell crab salad, papaya salad, chicken fried rice and fried banana with coconut ice cream. Within 10 min, we got our food. We were surprised how fast the service was. Everything was so delicious. The prawns were crispy and tasty. No wonder every table ordered this dish. We all love the food and we cannot wait to come back again. The staff was great. The place looks nice and big inside.  The outside looks normal and and small. Make sure you visit this place if you are out of town. Be sure to make reservation ahead to save you time."}
{"text":"We got there around 6 and we only had a 30 minute wait which was very lucky for us because the wait time usually is about an hour. The place is huge when you go in! Loved it here! Everything we ordered had a spice at a 7 or 8 and it was perfect. I love how it's spicy enough to burn your mouth but not too spicy where you can't taste the whole dish itself. It was the perfect balance and we all enjoyed several dishes to share. The fried duck in red curry was amazing and I usually don't like the coconut taste in curry but this was perfectly made with just a hint of coconut. We had seafood drunken noodles which wasn't too bad. The noodles kinda got stuck together in a big blob on the bottom of the dish. The spicy fried rice is amazing and the beef was great! Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Skip the strip, get a ride to this sketchy hole in the wall. That reveals a world class thai restaurant. Definitely the best Thai outside of the Land. Try the Prawns with the flesh and the shell fried together."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. Excellent wine selections and attentive servers. Food is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Delicious food gourmet one of the best places to eat sometimes a long wait but however it's worth it like the atmosphere people are friendly there prompt in their service when you're seated and she's the amazing food is scrumptious"}
{"text":"Went there with a large party of 13.. Heard lots of hype about how great this place was (one local called it a \"5 star\" dinning experience) so we were keen to check it out..

Food: mediocre. They messed up the green chicken curry (seemed watered down!), which was a surprise given that's a staple dish. Rest of the food was ok but some servings were tiny (like the papaya salad and crab fried rice). 

Service: good and why I gave this a 3 vs 2 stars. 

Ambiance: busy compared to the desolate complex it's in. We accidentally walked into the restaurant next door initially and there wasn't a sole inside - the waitress promptly asked if we wanted the Thai restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall just north of The Strip, LoS is worth the escape.  Best Thai food ever.  H-light: Anything crispy or curry in the description. Dumplings and duck come to mind."}
{"text":"delicious. a bit expensive. I'd go there again. strange serving situation but it works (aka waiters all over the place). Was sad I couldn't eat more!"}
{"text":"Don't be deterred by the seedy shopping center Lotus of Siam is in - the food is delicious and it's definitely worth the few seconds of weariness you feel as you pull up to the restaurant. We made a reservation and were able to get right in - definitely make a reservation, even if you aren't coming until late, we made one for 9 and there were still people trying to get in. The menu has a lot to offer and it was hard trying to decide what we were going to get. We settled on the garlic prawns since everyone on Yelp seemed to agree that they were a must, Tom Kha, Larb, and the Drunken Seafood Noodles. Everything was great! The Tom Kha was definitely some of the best I've had and the Larb was delicious. The garlic prawns were good, though a bit steep in price ($27) so probably would not order them again for that much. Overall, very good food and the wait staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best thai food i've ever had.  The menu is hugeeee, over 100 different items. It took me at least 15 minutes to decide what I wanted to order because everything sounded so good.  There was sooo much stuff that I really wanted to try.  I ended up going w/ some spicy catfish over lettuce (forgot what it was called, but it was good).  We also had a spicy catfish soup and stuffed chicken wings.  The portions are pretty good sized, so it was a lot of food.  The 4 of us were stuffed.  After the appetizers before our entrees came, we decided to order their crab fried rice too (which my friend told me was awesome), they took our order for that and our entrees came out.. and we got full halfway through eating it.  We could barely eat anymore... luckily our waiter knew that and didn't put the order in yet, thank god.  

The food here is VERY spicy, watch out for how spicy you order things.  It's from 1-10, and the 7 is extremely hot, even though i eat spicy food all the time.  The soup we ordered was 7, and i was dying and sweating non stop.  I asked if they had milk to cool down the spicyness, and the waiter laughed at me :( (as did everyone else at the table).  then i asked if i could change my entree from a 7 to a 2, and he said no too late, and laughed again :(.  But i was soooo happy he was just kidding when he brought my entree out and they changed it.  I think the next time I go, i'd probably go with a 4.

The wait was kind of long though, about 45 minutes, but well worth it.  We tried to make reservations, but it was a Friday night and they said they didnt take them that night.  

The service was awesome... The waiter was really nice and friendly, made lots of recommendations, checked on us all the time even though they were extremely busy.

Price wasn't bad, they have lots of entrees between $10 - $20.  For the four of us, with drinks, entrees, appetizers, and soup, it was $140 total w/ tax.

Also not only is the menu huge, the wine list has a very large selection too.

I'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, delicious and everything that i could want in Thai food. I would recommend a reservation or you will have to wait in line for dinner. If your first visit here is for the lunch buffet, keep in mind that the buffet is not a good refleciton of the quality of this place.
The Tom Yum Kai is awesome but the the En Tuan (Beef & Tendon Soup) is absolutely amazing. All the broths at this place are rich, spicy and very complex in flavor.  The curry here was good as well but wasn't much different from other Thai curries i've had before. The Pad Thai noodles were cooked just right and had a balance of flavors. The Papaya Salad was very refreshing and just the right amount of dressing. The unique dishes here is what makes this place a must. If you looking for mint and chicken, you can get that anywhere, read the reviews as you enter the restaurant and try something different and authentic to the region, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Large menu.  Something for everone's taste.  The food looks, smells and tastes great. It's not far from the strip....nice to get away."}
{"text":"Khao soi crispy duck was delicious.  Prices are on the high end for location but food is well worth it. Reservations are highly recommended.  We went in the middle of the week and it got crowded. Waiters were attentive. Plenty of parking. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For Vegas, you won't find a better Thai place than Lotus of Siam. Of course, getting there was a little difficult because it doesn't face the main street so there won't be any signs for it. You pretty much turn on a small street the directly connects to the plaza that Lotus of Siam is in. It doesn't look crackin' on the outside, due to the large unused lot, but once you step inside the venue, you'll see that the place usually has a full house around 7-9 PM. 

First of all, a must order is the Nam-Prik-Ong (Red Chili Dip under their Northern Thai Cuisine). It is a burst of flavor in every bite. The dip contains ground pork with various spices, and is eaten with sticky rice or fresh vegetables. After hearing about this dish from the all-famous, next Iron Chef Ming Tsai, I had to come to this place on one of my frequented trips to Las Vegas. And I have not stopped thinking about this dish since. Too bad its only an appetizer because I would definitely eat it as an entree if I could. 

We also had the Plar Koong, Nua Dad Deaw, Moo Yang, Tom Yum Kai, and various other dishes (went with a party of 8 hungry hungry hippos - JK, I love you guys). All of those dishes were great!! Just one warning though, if you get the soup and they ask you for what level of spicy-ness (1-10), don't say 7 unless you want to get your mouth seriously burned and engorged with capsaicin. That was the most spicy dish I've ever had. I bet the soup would have tasted lovely if it wasn't over powered by all that spice. But anyways, their food was still top notch for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is good. Eat the crispy duck drunken noodle and achieve ultimate happiness. Don't let the exterior fool you - this place is badass"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. You should add this to your top 10 list of things to do in Vegas. Worth the wait and the wait is long. if you want something quick go to a drive through. Drunken Shrimp is a must try dish."}
{"text":"I don't claim to know if this is the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. (the kids these days seem to like Jitlada in Hollywood), but this was a notch above the best places I've been to in the Bay Area. Having failed to make a dinner reservation, we got there around 2pm on a Friday and hurried to place our orders before the kitchen closed. Nam kao tod (crispy rice with minced sausage) had very bright flavour. Chicken wings were fried immaculately. Khao soi noodles had an intense coconut milk sauce. Panang pompano and especially hoh mok catfish were the best Thai fish dishes I've had by some margin. I even thought our veggie friend Dave's pad thai was tasty, and I have no love for pad thai.

Next time we'll order it spicier: this time we asked for something like \"spicy by American standards\", apparently Bay Area spice standards are hotter than in most of the U.S. Otherwise, grand."}
{"text":"First time trying Thai food and I'm so mad I've waited this long. The food there was amazing. I was impressed and will go back again. The only complaint I have is about the waiter. It was close to closing time and it seemed as if he was ready to go. Service can have been better especially after I let him know it was my first experience with Thai food!"}
{"text":"Food is good, if it wasn't the service we had tonite we'd be enjoying the food .The server is suck!!!! Can't enjoy our food because of him. Don't know if we ever come back but when we do absolutly not getting the same guy we got tonite. Discriminate, rude and slow!!!"}
{"text":"It seems like the popular Thai place to go in Vegas. 

Dropped in straight after work one day with co-worker and was lucky the bar area was open. So we were able to get down to ordering without waiting 30-40 minutes for a table. 

Overall, we enjoyed the food and service. Ordered some of the chef specialties and were impressed. The service was on point. The cost is on the higher side, compare to other Thai places. Would recommend to others that are looking for some Thai food for their special occasion or something."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  Every dish here was amazing tasty!!  The Garlic Prawn we had even the shell was delicious lol.  Cripy Duck Curry... whoooo.  So good :)  Service was awesome.  Got to try it if you havent!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the popular items - crispy prawns & drunken noodles. Both were MEH. My 2 other friends and I thought there was nothing special about it. 

I thought the pineapple fried rice was good but there was SO LITTLE of it. For 3 girls, 1 portion would not be enough. Order 2 servings if you like pineapple fried rice. 

Tom yum soup was okay, nothing exceptional. I've had better at other Thai restaurants

Overall, I'm happy I've had my fix about coming here. Everyone's been raving about it. Maybe other food items on the menu are good but from my experience it wasn't that great.

And from what I remember, each item was pretty expensive. Price was definitely above what other Thai restaurants would charge. 

If I come back, I will refer back to this review so I can remind myself what NOT to order."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I had in Vegas. It is worth the trip off the strip. Try the drunken noodle prawns."}
{"text":"This local favorite has earned a national reputation for its great Thai food. Although I have ordered off the menu a few times, I usually go to Lotus for their lunch buffet, and that's what we did today.

At first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). 

I steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called \"cilantro soup with egg.\" (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.)

The main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!)

Newbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town)."}
{"text":"So we ordered the drunken noodle soft shell crab, crispy duck panang and the gralic prawns. Prawns 3 stars, crab 2 stars and panang 4 stars.  Not sure what the hype with this place is about. Had 1 night in Vegas for a nice dinner and although the food wasn't bad, I do regret my decision. btw, this place is definitely not the best Thai food around."}
{"text":"100% amazing in every way. The staff was a team and I have never EVER received such efficient service. The food was amazing, and very reasonably priced. No wonder there was a line at the door. Just make sure to order a little less spicy than you think. My girlfriend likes spicy and ordered a 7, I like a little and ordered a 3. Both were too much for us. But so soooo good."}
{"text":"All I can say is, believe the hype. It's that good. 

Service was fine; atmosphere was whatever; but the food...the food was INCREDIBLE. My girlfriend and I split the Pad Thai & Green Curry chicken. 

Portions are on the smaller side if you're sharing - that, and it's so damn good you're going to want your own."}
{"text":"The pictures don't do it's justice!!! It's in a sketchy area, and the outside looks very very small. Once you walk inside it opens up and seats nearly 100 people. The wait was shorter than the waitress told us. They get you in pretty quick, and their food was the best food I've ever had. They had a gluten free menu which was perfect for me. The chicken pad Thai was great! If you are passing through vegas and want Thai food, don't hesitate and exit now!!"}
{"text":"A must try every time in Vegas.  Everybody knows about this place now but it is still just awesome.  Make sure you get a reservation first.

Great prices encourage trying multiple items.  Rieseling list here is amazing as well.

A must."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Thai food. A true classic in Vegas and good for locals and tourists alike. Don't miss the Northern Thai menu... so many authentic favorites."}
{"text":"Eating at Lotus of Siam is the quintessential Las Vegas dining experience. The buffets and fine dining on the strip are great, but the Thai food here is what I must eat every time I visit.

Don't order the typical Pad Thai or Pineapple Fried Rice which can be found at any Thai restaurant. People come here for the exotic Northern Thai dishes instead.

My all time favorite is the Crispy Duck with Penang Sauce. I actually don't like duck, not even what I've had in France or Beijing, which they're known for, but the duck here so good I've made an exception. It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. A rare and winning combination in my book. 

As other reviews have noted, Lotus of Siam truly is the best Thai food in America. There's a reason why people still cab it here even though it's located in a ghetto plaza far off the strip. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Awesome place a with amazing staff. The fish was outstanding. The pad Thai was spiced perfectly and noodles were perfect in texture.  The green and yellow curries were excellent with the right amount of coconut milk. Some were too watery but had great flavor delivery. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First off: There is no way in hell this is the best Thai food in the USA. Actually, I suspect, but don't know, that this is not the best Thai food in Vegas. I ate there a few times with my wife (we are both vegans). There were lots of vegetarian options, but it was very hit and miss. Some food was actually pretty good, and some very boring. Probably the worse was the \"Thai salad\": Note to staff, just putting peanut sauce on iceberg lettuce does not make it Thai.  

The staff were very friendly, but you really get a sense that you have to fit the rhythms of the restaurant. We went in at 9pm one night (kitchen closes at 9.30pm - at least during weekdays) and the last half of our meal was punctuated with the sounds of the vacuum cleaner (this also happened on another occasion when we in the last part of lunch). Really it is difficult to have a peaceful meal and enjoy your food when people are making a huge noise while you are trying to eat. Also the lighting is really harsh at night. Much calmer for lunch than dinner. Spicing is on a 1:10 scale and be aware that 10 is v. hot.

It is a big relief to be off the Strip though so we went back and the food was OK if not too great. It's about $12-$15 cab ride from the Strip.  Prices are reasonable.

Bottom line: nice place for a quiet lunch, but don't go with huge expectations."}
{"text":"I do not know what you people are talking about when rating this restaurant higher than a two star. My wife and I had lunch several weeks ago at Lotus and wife ordered the Prawns that everyone raves about...yuc! She could not tell the prawn from the tail it was so stuck together. I ordered the duck since so many people were raving about it. Thought I was going to be sick! Worse meal we had on our three week trip. Do not go!!!"}
{"text":"Yummm! We'd been on a lengthy road trip from LA to Vegas, to the Grand Canyon and into Page, AZ then to Zion and back to Vegas so you can see where we'd be a bit hungry and craving some actual real food.

It came as a surprise to me when I looked up Lotus of Siam and noticed so few reviews due to the new location but it didn't throw me off at all. I was very excited to finally try them. My son loves most ethnic food so I knew he'd be totally game for Thai as it's always been one of his favs.

We didn't have a rezzie but did walk-in to a short wait time. While some in here were dressed to the nines looking very \"Vegas\" we rolled in out of our car and were still totally fine, fitting in with more casual diners. It's really everyone so I won't say there is any one specific dress code. Looks like most things go.

Onto the menu...

We started with the dumplings and a wor wonton soup (both were very good) and shared the pineapple fried rice, yellow curry and pad se ew. 

Everything was filling and tasty (I'm not sure I'd order the pineapple fried rice again, only because I'm not a big fruit in my rice type person, but it was still nice to try it) and totally hit the spot after being on the road for a couple of days. We were staying in Vegas this evening and this was a perfect option for a great, off strip, out of a hotel meal.

I'd definitely return - a short cab/uber ride if you flew into Vegas and don't have a car with you."}
{"text":"Portion control is the best, healthiest, refreshing, good tasting food in Las Vegas. A must try. Once you try this embellished five star restaurant you'll never return to fast foods. RAW FITNESS and Portion Control interlocks together....Love Portion Control"}
{"text":"best place for foodies I take all my out of town guests here never disapointed"}
{"text":"I just moved here from New York and people Alsace been talking about lotus of Siam being the best Thai restaurant in America. I would say it's not bad but can't say the best, I've had better one in New York.  I ordered the stuff chicken wings which was pretty good. Garlic black pepper wings is just your average wings , larb chicken wasn't bad, kang ka noon (the server couldn't describe this dish to be but I ordered it anyway) I would order it again . Isaan sausage was average."}
{"text":"My first experience here was truly amazing.  Maybe because I came here for a bachelor party gathering and we went out afterwards...not completely sure.  I just remember the meal here that night took Thai cuisine to a whole new level so I was so excited to come here for my bday trip.

We ordered the Garlic Prawns, Chilean Seabass with Drunken Noodle, Crispy Duck, and the soft shelled crab.  All choices from the Chef's Choice portion of the menu.  All of these plates are over $20 which is pretty expensive but from what i remembered it was all amazing so it should be worth it right?  

The food came out pretty quickly so after snapping pics of our food from every angle, I wiped the drool from my chest and began to dig in.  The big plate of garlic prawns looked a bit overwhelming but we quickly learned that only 1/2 of the contents were edible because they butterflied the prawns then deep fried them so one wing is the meat and the other is the empty shell battered up.  Dang that's deceiving.

The duck was in this delicious curry gravy but you only got like 5 slices which equates to more than $5 a sliver.  The soft shelled crab was not bad but I feel like it's hard to mess this one up lol.  The most disappointing dish was hands down the \"Chilean Seabass\".  I know thru research that \"seabass\" is common fish name that is used interchangeably but \"Chilean Seabass\" is a very specific variety of seabass also known as the \"Patagonian Toothfish\".  This fish is different than the others because it has a much higher fat content which gives it that extremely buttery tender texture that separates itself from the other varieties.  

The fish I got was definitely NOT as advertised.  

What we got was tough and much leaner with a tough rockcod texture.  When I called the waiter over and complained about this, the manager came out and apologized saying it was overcooked but I beg to differ.  I've purposely overcooked Chilean Seabass at home before (to ensure the thick slab was cooked all the way thru) and it never was tough like rockcod.  I would like to think Lotus of Siam is a high class establishment and would never substitute higher grade meats for a cheaper variety but after watching the news recently about a restaurant being busted for this practice, I'm not so sure.  

Yes this new location is a whole lot nicer, but ambiance is only a third of  the equation of a wonderful dining experience.  Service was great with the gentleman server but not so great with the lady.  The most important element of a great meal is of course the food which was a miss for me. It's overpriced for very small portions and I felt tricked on the Chilean Seabass even though it was removed from our bill.  My next amazing Thai meal will be in Thailand now that I crossed Lotus of Siam off my list."}
{"text":"Yes it's a hole in the wall in Las Vegas but it is definitely a must. Even the locals know to go here. 

The must-haves:

Crispy Duck in Panang - OMG!!! Died and went to heaven. 
Garlic Prawns - large portion big enough to share.

We also had the green papaya salad but I didn't care for the preparation. I'm used to it being served with less fish sauce and thinly sliced shrimp. This version was a bit saturated in sauce. 

The location is somewhat hard to find in a strip mall, and the front looks unassuming. Once you enter the restaurant you're surprised as it's much nicer inside. You can tell it's famous by all the pictures of celebrities on the wall. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quality is really good. Khoa Soi is something I would eat again for sure. Crispy Duck with drunken noodles wasn't a favorite. Want to try the garlic prawns and curry next time. 
I wish this place was more intimate but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Simply incredible. The quality and range of flavor was magnificent. I was really impressed with the variety of items on the menu. I can't wait to go back and try some new dishes. I got the Tom Yum Goon at a 7 spiciness level. I'm pretty good with spicy food, but this was just a little over my threshold for enjoyment. There was a some minor panic and coughing but it subsided after about 10 minutes. I should have started a little lower level and worked up. It's all about your preference, of course. 

For entrees we split the steak salad and the house special fried rice. They both offered a range of flavor and their own nuances. I would order them both again. I can't wait to go back and delve into some curry, noodles, and specialty items. 

We didn't have to wait as we got there at 11:30 on a holiday. I've heard it gets really crowded, so plan ahead! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place because he saw it on that Anthony Bourdain show. Let me tell you, THE best Thai food hands down that I've ever had. We had the fish cake for appetizer. My boyfriend had the Northern larb (pork) & i had the roasted duck Curry..usually comes in red curry but I switched it for yellow curry. And oh my goodness...they were ALL super amazing!!! The staff was nice but could be more attentive. But nontheless...AMAZING PLACE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of meals. Great service even as we walked in 15 minutes before close. I am apparently not a fan of drunken noodles, and the panang curry was okay, but the musaman curry, oh the musaman curry! Probably the best curry I've had in my life."}
{"text":"OMG! I think this is the best Thai food place I have tried thus far. 

I must admit a yelper on here was right its in a hidden shopping center a creepy one, we went in the day thank goodness if not I would feel unsafe going at night. However, ONE MUST REALLY LOOK PAST THE PARKING LOT. 

As I entered the restaurant it looked like a hole in the wall your expecting this small shack, however you're greeted to a huge wall wine cases with wooden chairs and tables updated decor for a strip mall restaurant. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. 

So we tried the Chicken coconut soup, the flavor was just amazing you pick a 1-10 spicy rating my hubby picked a 7 and he was burning his mouth, I don't like spicy and I even could not stop sipping and eating this that's how good it was that I ignored the fact it was to spicy for me cause every other flavor was simply amazing. 

The fried garlic shrimp prawns were to die for, the were amazing I am at a tie with Hot N Juice as to which one I would prefer. The garlic and spices with the crunchy breading makes it seem you're in food heaven. This is a place you must visit. Many renowned chefs have visited, if you're a food you will understand why it is a must. Just come I am sure you will not regret it."}
{"text":"If you have eaten at one of the Thai Nakorns in Southern California, then you are spoiled like me. I guess I went to Lotus of Siam expecting something magnificent, to only be disappointed by a dinner of mediocrity. 

Having heard about Lotus of Siam and read the numerous glowing reviews on the internet, I had thought that we were going to be experiencing an orgasmic meal of mammoth proportions. Some of the reviews had proclaimed that Lotus of Siam was the best Thai restaurant on the West Coast. But I beg to differ. 

The food was mildly good. The restaurant itself was very bland, shoved away in a bleak strip mall in the dark corners of Las Vegas. Walking up to the restaurant, we had high expectations, but those were soured when we entered. The walls were overflowing with numerous accolades and yellowing newspaper clippings declaring the success and importance of the restaurant. OK so that was a good sign. Contrary to the restaurant's proclamation that there were no open seats, the supposed \"packed\" restaurant was dotted with a few parties and looked quite spare.

So we sat down in a booth towards the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and ordered a few bottles of sake. After being provided with our small bottles of sake and menus, we began ordering. A lady came by our table, the owner I guess, and tried to push a fried fish on us stating that we would like it. In fact, most of the night the servers tried telling us what we would like and not like suspecting us to be \"virgin\" Thai food eaters. 

The food came out in a somewhat fast progression, coupled with more bottles of sake. By that time we were feeling a wee bit of the sake, but the food kept us in reality as it did not conjure orgasmic feelings. In fact the food itself was quite unsettling, with very little flavor. By that time the owner had tried pushing the fried fish on us four times, we still did not budge. 

Leaving Lotus of Siam, we realized how spoiled we had become. Thai Nakorn was still the champion and Lotus proved to be an unworthy opponent."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in North America?? Although it was good, I can't say it was remarkably different than a lot of other Thai restaurants. My \"Northern Thai curry\" was actually too hot for me to eat comfortably (I had to order some plain rice to get the tofu down), although the menu really had no warning about that. My dining companion ordered his sea bass 7 out of 10 for hot. The waiter didn't ask me how hot I wanted my food, but it was clearly much spicier than the 7. I eat Thai food pretty regularly and haven't had this experience before. But that I kept eating anyway is a sign of how good it was. The people next to us got 6 pounds of deep fried lobster that looked pretty dramatic."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place, but it was in a dingy strip mall way off the strip on Sahara. How could it possibly be any good? Don't knock it until you try it! Nice ambience, good beer, great winelist and a very helpful waitress that helped us with the extensive menu. Lovely appetizers and main dishes. I would definitely go there again for either lunch or dinner. I suggest making reservations, this place is quite popular."}
{"text":"Much better location than the original.  Lunch wait was about 10 mins.  Food was excellent and fresh.  Will try dinner (need reservations) and expect the same quality.  Our waiter was very friendly, although not as familiar with the menu than he should be."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We were with a vegetarian so we ordered accordingly. It was a great meal! everything was so tasty! Going back asap!
Another GREAT restaurant off the strip in VEGAS!"}
{"text":"A very good place to go for Thai food. We ordered the Thai fried rice, green curry, garlic prawn, and the drunken noodles. All food was a bit spicier than expected but I love spicy food. The Thai fried rice was average but everything else was delicious. The drunken noodles had sea bass which was crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside with sweet and spicy noodles. Perfect balance of sweet and spicy along with crunchy and soft. The Curry was very creamy with chicken and bamboo, I usually don't like bamboo but this was amazing. My only complaint was that four dishes cost $80....Delicious food but fairly expensive. The serving sizes are also not very generous...."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that I've had in...well... maybe ever. I haven't been to Thailand yet though (01/10!)  Easily the best in Vegas.  MAAAAAYbe Krung Thai is close. That's it.  Great authentic N.Thailand dishes will knock your socks off. While waiting in the lobby you'll see the wall of reviews, many saying it is the best Thai in the US. I haven't ate at every thai place in the US so I can't co-sign that, but its fn good.

CLIFFNOTES: WOW. Authentic yummy thai food. Good location off the strip. Long ass wait so make a reservation. And yes it is THAT good. Trust me."}
{"text":"the best meal we had in vegas.  the neighborhood outside was nice and seedy, the restaurant and people inside were warm and friendly, the decor was spare and clean, the wine list was enormous, the pad see yew and red curry were good, and the bacon fried prawns, crispy rice, sea bass som tam, coconut ice cream with sticky rice and mango and fried banana desserts were fantastic."}
{"text":"Crispy duck Khao Soi and the garlic prawns. AMAZING! Don't forget dessert!! Coconut ice cream served over warm sticky rice. You won't want to share. Do yourself a favor and come here. 

You will need to make reservations a couple days in advance if you can't stand to wait 30 mins to 2 hours depending on the night. My boyfriend and I waited. It was worth it.

I'm giving 4 stars based on my boyfriends dish. He got the beef panang. It was good but not 5 stars good. I like to save my 5 star reviews for places that leave me dreaming about the next time I will get to eat there."}
{"text":"Garlic prawns were amazing, whole family loved - crunchy, tender, tasty, great portion. The crispy rice with sausage was a foodie experience, 5 stars - unique, ton of flavor, loved the mint and red onion. 

Hubby had crispy duck, high on the spice meter, tender and very hot - and he likes spicy. He described is as a different type of heat that he wasn't used too, great experience with Thai chillies. 

I wasn't impressed with the Khao Soi with beef - beef was hard and chewy, I had to politely spit it into my paper napkin, found two more hunks of that. Didn't want to fill up on the noodles, enjoyed the broth, and the crunchy noodles on top got soggy quick. 

Didn't have a reservation, but was seated in 30 min., reasonable for a Saturday night at 6:00, considering its popularity. A great experience for us, beginners at Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I love the food here! Their remodel really opened things up and it's been for the better. This is a Las Vegas favorite and a good place to take out-of-towners. 

Unfortunately, because of the area, you have to be careful at night in the parking lot. 

The one downside of this place is that sometimes the wait is long. Once I had to continually ask the hostess if we were still on the list and I was afraid to step outside because I just thought I would lose our place in line. While they were busy, I felt ignored that time; it is always nice to get an update when you have to wait a while. Also, there is no real place to wait inside.

As for the food: Definitely worth the wait. Lots of options and good dishes to share. Traditional and unique dishes for this Thai gem."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh Thai food.  Do not let the looks of the outside of this place fool you."}
{"text":"Simply, best of the best. A true gem of Vegas"}
{"text":"Las Vegas don't joke around when they say it's spicy.  

Papaya salad -I usually regret it every time I order papaya salad at Thai restaurants because the papaya is too hard, and flavor is nothing spectacular.  I just get tired of chewing it.  This papaya salad was the best I've had thus far.  The cabbage on the side helps to take away the monotony in texture.  We requested it to be spicy, and boy did they deliver!  Our mouths were on fire.  In a good way.

Duck noodle soup - I was pretty hungover after binging at the pool all afternoon, and in desperate need of soup.  This is my go-to hangover dish in LA at Rodded, and was ecstatic to find it on the menu.  False hope.  It looked the same.  Flavor? Not so much.  It was bland.  Didn't have enough of the tanginess.  

Pad see ew - We asked for it spicy again, and friends couldn't finish it.  Pad see ew is pad see ew.  

Ordered another entree, which I can't recall.  Obviously, it was nothing spectacular.  

Mango rice for dessert - First time trying this dish.  It doesn't taste as odd as I always imagined it would be.  The subtle sweetness of the mango was the perfect end to a meal.  I crave this.

Make a reservation or regret it.  We had a reservation, and still waited about 15 minutes. 
Service was excellent.  Very attentive.  Our waiter came by several times to check if we needed anything.  
I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this place, but it didn't stand out from any other Thai restaurant I've tried."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about Lotus... Came to Vegas with my BFF and met her friend and former client. Decor was pretty bad - bright lights and in a strip mall but had a great table and really delicious food. 

They came by the table right away and took our drink order which we really appreciated. Had to wait a little bit to order but ended up with a really delicious meal. We started with chicken satay and ended up ordering a second. We had basil chicken medium heat which was a perfect spice level. Overall really solid meal."}
{"text":"It's hard to explain to people how much better Lotus is than almost any other Thai restaurant in the US.  Here's some suggestions for getting the most out of your visit (based on the ~10 times I've eaten there during business trips):

Make a reservation - yes, they take them, and now via the website. 

Go with a group - 5 or 6 allows you to get a good variety.

Take their advice on what to order - especially that of the wonderful older woman that works behind the bar (most nights). 

Specific dishes that are especially amazing (like, best in the US amazing): tom kha kai soup, traditional pork larb, northern pork larb, beef salad, grilled prawns with garlic and lime, crispy duck with panang curry, beef short rib with masaman curry. 

As many other reviewers have noted, the wine list is extensive.  The sake selection is also extensive and that wonderful bartender will steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"fabulous... make reservations.  large menu, many variations available... delicious, fresh, great flavor, and excellent service."}
{"text":"A trip to Vegas would not be complete for me if I couldn't make a stop at Lotus of Siam.  I always order the curry noodle soup with chicken, it's from their Northern Thai dishes menu.  The last time I was there I think I saw what must have been the owner's daughter because she seemed to be a teenager and just strolled in and the curry noodle dish was placed in front of her.  Needless to say, this dish is a winner.

The restaurant has expanded so the wait doesn't seem as bad."}
{"text":"This is always a must stop every time I'm in Vegas. All these years, I've never been disappointed. This is always packed!!  It's usually a hit or miss when I order something new at a restaurant, but not here. Everything is sooo good!!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best Thai food I've ever had.  

A colleague and I stopped in here after a long workday in town and were pleasantly surprised by a wide-ranging menu of Thai dishes to satisfy most appetites.  Not knowing what to get, we asked who we thought was our server (actually she just brought us water) and she gave us a few suggestions.  Then my colleague asked the question that unlocked a treasure trove of details \"what do you eat on your breaks here?\"  She went through just about every section giving us her favorite item from each and even had suggestions for my friend who wanted super spicy and for me who didn't want spicy.  

Soup was on point.  Appetizers were on point.  Entrees were on point.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype! It's busy and is quite a wait, but well worth it. I ordered the prawns for an appetizer and the roasted duck curry for my entree. Sooooo goood! Definitely my go to place in Vegas for Thai food. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I was back in Vegas for a one-night business trip.  Couldn't help stopping by Lotus of Siam for the amazing garlic prawns (now up to $26).  I also had the Thai beef salad, which was terrific.  Based on two visits while in Vegas, I'd say their top dishes are tops, but some of their other dishes are no better than and simply on par with other great Thai restaurants.  Their style feels a little heavier than some places I've been to in Los Angeles Thai Town, but their great dishes are very tasty indeed!

They are a busy restaurant, and service is good, not great.  It takes a while for the waiters to come take your order."}
{"text":"BUZZ
- Garlic Prawns (4/10)
- Drunken Noodles

I ALSO TRIED
- Tom Kha Kai w Chicken (5/10)
- Penang Curry w Beef (4/10)

First off, I haven't written a review in a really long time! I love the fact that I travel a decent amount for work, so I get to try a lot of new places and write reviews. Ironically, it's because of that travel that I haven't been able to write any reviews lately. I've had so many jam-packed 1-day travels that, I might check in to a hotel on Yelp, but I'll knock out about 20 seconds after, then wake up, shower, and leave - all while still kinda sleeping. Even meals have been rushed. The business dinners might be in nice restaurants, but we're having such fierce conversations about work, that the food might as well have just teleported into our stomachs without ever being tasted.

OK, now that that's out of the way, a little history. Pad Thai used to be what I thought Thai food was. Yes, I know that it IS Thai food, but I mean I thought that was all Thai food was! In 2007, I had Lotus of Siam and we ordered all sort of things and it was amazing. Since then, I discovered more facets of Thai food, namely Tom Kha and Penang Curry. Ever since I tried those, I've been dying to try them at Lotus, because this is touted by some as the best Thai restaurant on the planet!

TOM KHA KAI
Server asked how spicy I wanted it, and then said \"on a scale of 1-10.\" I was taken aback, because that's a really wide range! Even though I normally order \"Extra Spicy\" at other Thai places, the numbers intimidated me a bit, so I just said 8.

It tasted fine, but it didn't have anything in there that would make it taste great. No landmines, so that's good. The chicken was seasoned enough, but dry. The Tom Kha (and maybe this is just the style) was missing the tiny bit of sweetness that I've come to like and expect. As for spice, the first spoonful, I thought I got duped, but then after about 3 more spoons, the heat started to rise! Not enough for me to grab water, but enough where taking bites of the hot garlic prawns were painful on the tongue. It really seemed like that if you just had the soup, the 8 would actually be like a 6, but I think the higher the number, the more pepper bits are in the soup, so you just have a higher chance of picking one up, and those peppers themselves pack a punch!

PENANG CURRY
Sigh. It's missing that almost nutty flavor that I've come to like, and it was a little too ginger-y/lemongrassy than I like. Consistency was about as much as condensed milk, and a spice level of 8, tasted more like a 4. The beef didn't really lend any helpful flavors, but hey, at least it was protein! Not the worst I've ever had, but I'm just really disappointed, considering how many people have this as their favorite Thai restaurant. Then again, it could just be different styles, which I admittedly don't know much about.

GARLIC PRAWNS
I remember when I was little, a friend of mine used to eat the shrimp tail. I was mesmerized! I had never even tried it before. So, I fearlessly started trying to eat the tail, and I was almost to the point of gagging. Fast forward 25 years and here I am at Lotus of Siam. 

The shrimp comes out looking like the letter w. The left \"u\" is the shrimp, the right \"u\" is the shell of the shrimp, both still connected at the tail. The whole thing has been seasoned and deep fried. Now, I've had Japanese sweet shrimp before, where they fry the heads, and it was better than eating that shrimp tail many years ago, but I couldn't eat more than 1. These were definitely better, but it took a lot of mental psyching and determination to eat several. 

The shrimp is good. The shell is actually pretty tasty. Out of all the fried shrimp shell I've had, this was the best. It was more crunchy/crispy than any other one I've had by far. And it had a buttery flavor to it that helped take my mind off of the shell. For me, if I took a bite of shrimp and a bite of shell, that was a tumultuous bite, and I had to fight the urge to spit it out. The trick was to eat the shell by itself, like it was one big shrimp chip. The other thing was to keep my mouth dry. Once I took the bite, I had to keep saliva away (sorry to get so technical here) and definitely resist the urge to \"wash it down.\" When the shell was dry and crispy, it shattered easier, which meant that it ground down finely so it was easy to swallow...like a chip. As soon as moisture was introduced, the shell no longer wanted to shatter, instead it would just flex, which meant that when you swallowed, it was that rough shell-like texture that made me want to gag. 

So all in all, happy I tried it, but perfectly fine with never trying it again.

LOTUS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
I can't tell you how disappointed I was with the curry and soup. I've been waiting at least 4 years to have an opportunity to come to Vegas to try these dishes, and it didn't deliver. It's not to say this place isn't good. I have had great meals here, but they're not good at my fav.dishs"}
{"text":"This place kicks ! Came here 15 years ago and it was pretty good. Now, just as good or better Had the panang curry and green papaya salad, both on 10. Could have gotten the salad on 8 but the curry was right on point. Tres délicieuse !"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in the US? Hmm... that's a bold statement. I've had a lot of amazing thai food in NYC and not enough Thai food on the west coast or in Las Vegas in particular to make this type of statement. I will bow to the fact that everything is excellent and it makes me want to return to Las Vegas just to try this restaurant one more time.  Next time, I want to bring 10 people so we can order a larger variety of dishes and try a litlte bit of everything.

From what I did try, here are my thoughts:
Beef tar tar: Spicy, but not in an overpowering burnt tongue way. I could really taste the different spices put into that make it burst in your mouth

Prawn salad: Very interesting combination of sweet and spicy. Prawns were huge and seared slightly. Probably the least favorite out of all I ate.

Crispy duck curry: Crispy duck was ... very crispy. I think the coconut milk curry was excellent, but the duck could have been any crispy meat and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I just like this because curry is awesome with rice.

Chicken pad thai: This was my favorite. I can tell this place is awesome by how amazing they make their pad thai. The noodles didn't stick together and the flavor was evenly distributed across every noodle. The peanut sauce was there for the kick and not overpowering. Chicken was tender and a nice addition.

Tom Yum soup: We ordered this after eating everything else because we needed to get a taste of the other popular thing on Thai menus.  Yum. Must try. It wasn't lit on fire like at Jaiya, but it was delicious and the perfect amount of spicy and sour.

Overall, I can't wait to go again. I'm a bit confused why it's in the middle of nowhere, but I'm glad this hasn't stopped people from taking the trek to get there and enjoy.  Be sure to make reservations because this place gets packed by 6:30"}
{"text":"Overrated thai restaurant. Decent food but overpriced for what you get. I'm from San Francisco so I've had a lot of quality thai food at affordable prices. Not bad food but does not live up to the hype. I had the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and their garlilc prawns."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. Met our friends from out of town at this place and was shocked how the quality has gone DOWN. The portion sizes are pitiful now. Food still tastes okay but I never thought it was that amazing compared to any other Thai restaurants in town. 

I was also taken aback when we made our reservation and they said that if we were more than 5 minutes late, they would cancel it! FIVE MINUTES!?!?! The standard in restaurant industry is 15. We had a large party as well and people were arriving separately. I guess they don't want to encourage locals to come here. 

I think it's time to find a new Thai restaurant to recommend to my friends who are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Thai food is not my first food choice but I could eat here every single day. 

No one cares about decor when the food is this good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Thai food restaurant offered in Vegas! I would absolutely come back here again next time I am on town!"}
{"text":"A great Thai Restaurant. Good atmosphere, a huge wine cellar. Great soups Tom Yum and Tom Kha, followed by Sweet Basil Chicken, Pad Thai and Red Curry Chicken. I loved the fresh Asian Chili's, so much nicer than the dried chili's so many plces use.
Very nice overall"}
{"text":"They are best known for their garlic prawns so be sure to order it! They separate the shell but somehow leave it attached, then they deep fry the prawns to a golden brown, making it plump, succulent, yet crispy.  The idea is to make it so crispy you can even eat the shell.  Delicious! We also had the drunken noodles (like pad see ew) topped with your choice of duck, soft shell crab or sea bass (which was how we had it). Also good.  The crispy duck over noodles in a coconut curry was also a hit.  The least popular dish was the short ribs in the same, exact curry sauce as the duck...we could've skipped that one entirely. We enjoyed the meal a lot but I had to knock it down by 1 star because every dish we ordered was close to $30 which is way more than the average price of a similar dish in other restaurants within the same class/range. Yelp only has this marked as $$ which I think is misleading. They should be at     $$$.  If you are willing to spend the money then by all means, dine here!"}
{"text":"Just know that once you eat here your expectations will be very high.  I have been to SEVERAL thai restaraunts since moving from Las Vegas and have yet to find one where the food and service can match up.
The dishes are authentic, the flavor and spices are amazing (especially the Panang Curry), and the servers are extremely attentive.  
My advice is to come early or make a reservation because you WILL have to wait (even on a Tuesday night it can get crowded).
Don't be turned off by the sad strip mall and the pan handlers in the parking lot (especially the couple on their bikes)...it's what's inside that counts."}
{"text":"Wow!  They have creative authentic dishes.  They are located in a shopping center with no curb appeal.  I would not have chosen this place to eat on my own.  My cousin, who lives in Las Vegas, brought me here.  And I'm glad she did.

Food is served family style. We ordered crispy duck with panang and garlic shrimp.  The duck was moist and tender with crispy skin.  The panang was flavorful but mild.  I've never had duck in panang so that was exciting.  The shrimp meat was pulled out of the shell but not detached.  They left a strip of meat in the shell.  The shell was fried so crispy that you could eat the shell like chips. The shrimp was flavorful with lots of garlic.  Service was excellent.  We went Wednesday night and it was packed.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was good. I've tried it twice so far debating on what I should rate it. From all the reviews, I guess I had really huge expectations from this place especially since I am a big Thai food lover.

One thing I really like about this place is that the menu has Northern style cuisine. I actually have never tried Northern style Thai so it was a really cool change of pace. 

A big tip is that this place gets packed during busy hours. I came once for lunch and there was about 1-130 hr wait so I had to eat somewhere else. There was no way I was going to wait an hour for lunch. The second time I came, I came after dinner time around 900 and we still had to wait about 15 mins to be seated. The third time, I made reservations around 530 and had no problems getting a table.

The service is good. When it's not too busy the waiters will be on point. But when it starts getting busier, you realize that you don't exactly have a certain waiter assigned to you and it's pretty much a free for all. The more packed it is, the less good service you'll receive. When I came around 530 when it was empty, the waiters were really fast on our demands. But by the time it was hitting 700, it was hard to track down our waiter bc he was off running somewhere else.

We ordered an array of food. Drunken noodles with sea bass and soft shell crab, garlic prawns, panang curry with crispy duck, mussels and beef satay. All were okay. Nothing spectacular of sort. The drunken noodles were really OILY!! I have no idea why people keep raving about it but it's so doused with sauce and the noodles get soggy. The noodles break apart easily that whenever you pick it up with chopsticks you can't get a good bite. The garlic prawns were okay. I really like the crispness but I expected more garlic. Did not have a hint of garlic to it. My favorite was the panang curry with crispy duck. The duck was super crispy even when soaked in curry and the panang curry is sooo good!! The only downside to this dish is that they give you TOO LITTLE CURRY compared to the amount of duck!!!

Overall, this place is good. I don't think it's spectacular as some people rave it to be. Its not really authentic too bc I've had some authentic Thai and it tastes better. Other than that it's a good spot to know if you're craving Thai."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The duck was incredible. Will definitely go back the fried banana was very good as well"}
{"text":"Are we even talking about this?!?! This place blows my mind every time. Those garlic prawns are a steal at twice the price. 

For a truly incomparable experience come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Again, thank you Anthony Bourdain for showing us this place. My family and I came here on Sunday at 6 pm and it was so packed. We didn't make a reservation but it seems like you can and I probably would do that next time. We waited about an hour, it seemed forever. The place is huge and very beautiful. Probably the most fanciest Thai restaurant I've ever been too. The plate portions are small, expensive but so delicious. So many different spices in one bite it's mouth watering. We got 2 different rice plates I believe basil and crab. We got pork and beef drunken noodle plates. Lastly our favorite plate was the crispy duck, we asked for the sauce on the side but I'm sure either way it would of been still good. A total of 5 plates and there was 5 of us to share that, I say were content not super stuffed but not hungry after. Oh and don't forget the Thai tea, I approve and my brother says the Thai coffee was 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"They have a big menu that includes fish and duck dishes some other Thai restaurants don't have.

Their portion size is also not the typical Thai restaurant portion, I would say half of what you get at other places. Our soup (Tom Kha kai) came in a pot with flame in the middle which was cool, but it wasn't the best I've had. Their duck dishes are pretty good. Curry came in a very shallow, and wide bowl which made it go cold after a couple of minutes with their A/C."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. The wait for a table is always worth it. This place is in a dump of a shopping center but don't let that scare you. Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I was ordered by my boss to check out Lotus of Siam while I was in Vegas a few weeks ago...  Good thing I listened.

I LOVE Thai food, but these guys take this to a new level.  I ordered Khao Soi: the simplicity of the dish belies how delicious it was.  It was a textbook example of how Thai food precisely balances, \"sweet, sour, spicy, and salty.\"  I was a bit disappointed there was no wine to pair my food with (Boo, liquor authority technicalities...), but then again the mere fact they proudly offer multiple versions of Gewurztraminer left me smiling, well after I left Vegas.

Definitely worth going off the Main Vegas Strip for!  Just be sure to plan well in advance, esp. if you want dinner for large parties!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've ever had... by leaps and bounds. Incredible depth of flavor, great service as well. A FOODIES' MUST!"}
{"text":"Worth the taxi ride from the strip.  Some of the best thai food I have had in the US. 

The beef tartar appetizer is spicy and is unusual.  Quite good.  The tom young soup is a high quality and spicy version of the standard.  Don't miss the crispy duck - so delicious and comes in the best curry sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just go. Yes the area surrounding it is a little sketchy, but I mean, you are in Vegas, and what trip to Vegas isn't filled with a little adventure and outside of the norm experiences?

Anyways, get there early as the place is packed. Don't let the wait scare you, put your name in and they will call/text you. We decided to use the wait time to go get our marriage license. You don't have to follow in our footsteps, but then again, you are in Vegas. ;)

Food wise I had the Kang Ka Noon, veggie style. My not-yet-wife at the time had the Khoa Soi.
Both were great but I can easily see that the meat free dishes take a distant backseat to all the other amazing choices."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars. It should be 4.5 stars. There were a few little things that were \"off\". But mostly amazing. 

First the service...  I called for reservations a couple weeks in advance because I tried to get in when we had company before and couldn't do it. So we had to wait about 5-10 min after our reservation time which wasn't bad. We were seated in a booth that was pretty small for 5 of us. But it turned out to be ok because they cleared off the empty plates quickly. Our waiter was knowledgeable, but I had a difficult time understanding him at times. At the end we asked for to go boxes. Our waiter was very busy with a large party of people next to us. So we asked one of the other server people walking by. He gave us plastic coated boxes for the leftovers which included curry which would not have worked. We then asked our waiter again for some plastic to go tubs. He said he usually packs up the leftover food for us and put our curry in the tubs. Our water was filled constantly and our drinks were refilled often before we asked. So the service is not a well oiled machine yet. I'm thinking that they haven't been in the new place that long and there are a few kinks to work out. 

About the food, I ordered the Koong Sarong (prawn in a blanket) appetizer. That was one of the best tasting foods we ordered. It tasted like bacon fried wonton wrapped shrimp, but I couldn't find the bacon. It just had the flavor of bacon. So good. We also ordered the garlic fried prawns because everyone talks about it. When they first brought it out, it was cold. I asked they if it was supposed to be cold because it was sitting on some cold chopped cabbage. They said no and brought another warmer plate. It was really good and crunchy with good flavor. I'm glad I tried it, but won't order it again because it's very expensive for what you get. We ordered crab fried rice. It had large pieces of egg, crab and other things like large pieces of cold cucumber and tomato. That made the rice get cold quickly. I'm not sure I understand the value of using cold food in a warm dish of food, but my friend said that is how they do it in Thailand. Mmmm.  So the flavor was good , but I won't order that again. I had green curry and my husband had Musaman curry. The flavors are amazing. He ordered a 3 hotness level, I ordered a level 2. Mine was much hotter than his. I think it might be difficult to regulate the hotness levels when some of the dishes have fresh chili's/peppers and some do not. At any rate, both of the curries were excellent...better than anywhere we have ever been. My son ordered the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles. and said it was excellent. I guess it's difficult to find duck prepared correctly. He was very happy. My daughter in law ordered Beef Rama. She said it was amazing. My daughter order Squid Garlic. She said it was ok, but would try something else next time.  I will definitely come back. I like a quieter environment, but I really love the food. I'd like to just go there for a date with my husband. 

Summary.... excellent flavors and sauces! If you would like warm food, don't order food on a bed of cold salad. Be patient with the service. All the servers were friendly.  Slightly noisy, but nice decor."}
{"text":"This is good Thai food, but a little overpriced if you ask me.

 I asked one of my Thai friends who's also a chef on the strip what he thought of Lotus of Siam, he said, \"Well... I'd eat it.\" he went on to say Archi's is much more authentic, well priced, and better overall. 

I think I'll try Archi's next time I'm hungry for Thai food."}
{"text":"The yellow curry dish was amazing! The portion was perfect. The dish wasn't as hot as I'd like but he brought me a spice rack. I love wine and the wine selection is very long. They is a wine case that's clear and is seen when you walk through. I  recommend this restaurant for those who like Thai."}
{"text":"What a little gem! We ate lunch here before heading back home on a Monday afternoon. We arrived just as they opened at 11:30AM, and the place filled up very quickly. It was packed and there was a line by the time we left. 

We ordered the Nam-Prik-Ong, as recommended by Ming Tsai and based on the reviews, as well as the crispy duck over Panang curry. We had the coconut ice cream over sticky rice for dessert. The food was absolutely amazing! 

The Nam-Prik-Ong was the perfect blend of spices - savory with a warm spice. It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it. It's a perfect little appetizer. 

The crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness. 

For dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and \"marinated\" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully. 

We went for lunch and there was a buffet for $9.99 per person. We decided to eat off of the normal menu because we wanted to experience what all the hype was about. We ended up spending a lot more between the two of us, but it was well worth it. 

The only thing I wish could've been different is the quantity of food. Although we were full at the end of the meal, it was so yummy that we wanted a few bites more. But that's probably just us being gluttonous."}
{"text":"The thai food here is beyond good. I love the thai wings and everything else on the menu. The friend fish is sooooo gooooooood!!!!!!!!!! I lived in vegas and can honestly tell you that the drive off the strip is the only way to go and to come to this restaurant is just a treat. The place has such loyal patrons that the will save seats even when there is a line forming outside. That is how loyal people who come here are. When you make reservations, you will show up because the food is that good."}
{"text":"Most amazing Thai restaurant I've ever been to I'm from MI and went there during a trip to CES needless to say I came back less then a month later to go again highly recommended"}
{"text":"Late review: July 3
I totally had to try this spot since it was featured on Top Chef Masters.
It did not disappoint.  Place was totally packed.  We had a large party so we had to be seated in two different tables.  Service was good.
We tried a little bit of everything and LOVED it.  My daughter is picky when it comes to fried rice but she totally loved it and wanted more."}
{"text":"Awesome food - small portions.  I had to buy 2 of everything in order to feed my family of 4."}
{"text":"Best Thai Place here in Vegas and our Server was great!!! Even tho its packed and real busy! Food was amazing!! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've ever had.  The decor wasn't the best.  The location wasn't the best.  The service wasn't the best. The flavor was the best.  Had a glass of wine before our table was ready.  Hardest decision was knowing what to order from their 10 page menu.  I went with the crispy duck.  So good, but I was jealous of my wife's shrimp dish with cilantro and chilis.  My mother-in-law had a curry dish that she loved.  She said it was light and not too sweet.  I'd like to thank Action Bronson and his munchies show for suggesting this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Thai food, look no further. I can't say enough about the crispy duck.  The new location is great, though I am glad to hear they are reopening the old location. Make a reservation well in advance. They take a certain number of walk ins, but the wait can be long. Though The last time we walked in, we got seats in the bar area almost immediately."}
{"text":"So this place has excellent food. over a thousand ratings and a 4 star average pretty much guarantees that. What's good? I really liked my drunken noodle prawns ($22.95), and they are more towards the top range in price for this restaurant. Other options well received by this party of five were the pad thai and curries. Prices are generally between $9 and $15, super cheap for Vegas, especially for food of this quality. 

Decor is not what you're here for- it's standard, aside from the star studded wall with tons of pictures of the head chef (owner?) with the who's who of Food Network. Bathrooms are a tad sketchy, but clean. This place takes reservations and is extremely popular, so make them if you can. The only hiccup for our party was that one of our group did not receive their meal until we reminded the server. Everyone else had rec'd their entrees and it was clear they had somehow missed that part of the order. Unfortunately, there was no discount given or even an apology for that mishap, which lengthened our time at the restaurant significantly.  Thus, they go from a five star to a four for this experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on Travel Channel's Best Eats Episode. Winnas! Great Tai Food. Garlic shrimp, Drunken Noodles with pork, and their famous chili dip-Nam prik Ong (combo of ground pork, tomatoes, n dried spices)"}
{"text":"Really wished I could have gone back for the 3rd time! This place really is a \"not so hidden\" gem. The duck panang is my absolute favorite. Some of the appetizers and soup were too sour for me ( yes I know it's hot and sour soup but they were really generous on the sour side). If you don't like too much spice I would stick to scale of 2-5. I was ambitious and tried 8 on my second visit and could NOT handle the heat. The green curry and garlic prawn are delicious. We broke the rule and tried the pad Thai as well (I know so basic) but it was decent. This place does not disappoint as the food is warm and fresh. Make sure to call ahead and make reservations! Can you please open this restaurant in DC?! Pretty please? I don't wanna wait until my next visit to Vegas to have me some duck panang!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors, great great Thai food!
I also like to come here for the buffet lunch with a friend. It's only ten bucks you can't beat it!
Take your pick you can't go wrong unless you're like Ben Stiller in Along Came Polly."}
{"text":"Supposedly the \"best that in America\"... And actually one of the most disappointing. Service was mediocre and the food was dismal. We ordered the Tom ka kai and papaya Salad for appetizers... Both which were lacking flavor and not to mention extremely small portions. Main course included a few curries and pad ke mow and we were given enough rice for half a person... Wasn't sure why they didn't give enough rice for all the curry dishes... Regardless, the highlight of our night was the Thai Coffee which even a two year old can make half asleep. Needless to say this has been the most disappointing and overrated experience in recent times. I wouldn't waste time or energy going here... The food is so average, the prices are amped up and the portions small. If you really want good Thai go to Thai house on Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch. Won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Thai food, the service can be hit or miss but the food is almost always good! It's also pretty reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"So after dinner I had a huge discussion with my friend Angela who lives here in Vegas about this place.  I mean, this place has gotten crazy reviews from everyone about being the best Thai place not only in Vegas but also North America.  And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?

Well, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.

We then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  

We got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.

So overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from my recent visit here. Our table ordered a bunch of stuff, but my recommendation is the crispy duck panang curry which was amazing. The crispy duck adds a nice texture to the creamy curry. The curry sauce was delicious, and I dipped everything in it. My second favorite was the garlic prawns. They fry them up extra crispy, even the shell. The pad thai was different, because they use a thinner noodle. I perfer the thicker one, but the flavor was good. My least favorite had to be the tom yum soup which was so sour, no one could eat it. We only waited 15 min, but I know it can get quite busy here so good luck."}
{"text":"Loved it.  The hype was well deserved.  My wife had Crispy Duck Panang and I had Green Curry.  The duck was delicious and pretty much perfect.  My curry was tasty and well prepared though their spice level was a bit much for me.  It was my fault since I ordered it at a 7 without reading the reviews first.

Wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Regardless of location this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Great food in a nice calm environment. Very cozy place & always a good experience. Right next to it is my favorite Tai restraunt in town though. Kohmels! That place is even better in my opinion."}
{"text":"So, I heard so much about this place and finally made it.... Honest to say the food was really not all that great, It was either to sweet or just too sour. Our server really was not in the mood to give us recommendations. And I also think it is overpriced for the the amount of food. The restaurant itself overall is nice, but I think it is way too over rated."}
{"text":"With over 2,000 reviews, I am not sure that there is much that I can add.  But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.

The first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.

The second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.

So if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I ate here with six other people, and we all split our plates with each other. We had a couple of curry dishes (wonderful) the crispy garlic shrimp (amazing), and the drunken shrimp (I think, it was right next to the garlic shrimp on the menu). We all loved the food and had a great meal. I'd recommend going with a big group so that you can try a lot of things on the menu."}
{"text":"I defy you to find a better Thai restaurant in this country.  Be careful the cook has a temper."}
{"text":"food is fine. the penang crispy duck curry ($28) is overpriced (the curry/gravy is delicious but the duck itself is not worth that much) and the seafood drunken noodles were good ($14). service was the literal bare minimum."}
{"text":"This restaurant is off the strip but definitely a must when you're hungry in Vegas. If you're going to eat here, skip to the back of the menu where the \"Northern Thai\" dishes and chef selections are because that's what they specialize in. Don't come here for that pad thai or pad see ew stuff. I can go on and on about the spicy garlic prawns - sooo amazing. And the crispy duck curry? Wooow. This place is obviously a local and tourist favorite because the wait time gets pretty long and while we were waiting for a table, others who were waiting with us kept saying this was the only restaurant they eat regularly at."}
{"text":"Not worth the price be any means.    The noodles were watered down and our sticky rice was not sticky.    It was mushy.     The golden prawns were fresh but nothing amazing.   I am so glad our Essam and Lao friends were not with us because it seems Lotus of Siam lost its touch with its roots and now mass produces it food.     It worth $75 for 3 dishes."}
{"text":"After hearing this was the best thai place is all of Nevada we decided to give it a try! I'm glad we did. We found the same dishes we enjoyed in Thailand! We started off with some sweet Thai iced teas and chicken satay. For our main dishes we enjoyed the garlic prawns and seafood fried rice. I also ordered a side of rice with yellow curry. Both dishes along with soup, were definitely flavorful and prepared perfectly. Unfortunately, the portions were so large that we couldn't make any room for dessert! Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Lovely to find a Thai buffet in Vegas for lunch. The tom kha is really good, spiced up the way i like it. The fried bananas where good too, we especially liked the pad Thai, most places I've been to don't make a good pad thsi, this place does."}
{"text":"I was here over the Thanksgiving Holiday from SoCal.  I must say that the food here is excellent.  One of the top 5 Thai places I have ever been too.  Definitely try the Crispy Duck with Panang Curry and Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  The service was excellent.  Make sure to show up early as this place gets packed with locals and visitors from out of town.  Definitely worth any sort of wait.  The only negative was the people wanting to wash my windshield and wheels on my car in the dark parking lot outside."}
{"text":"I would DEFINITELY go back here next time I visit Las Vegas!  I can understand why this place is so popular, and let me tell you, the wait is definitely worth it, but make a reservation in advance if you can!  (Tip: I have heard that it isn't as packed for lunch if you want to casually show up, but for dinner, especially if you're visiting, MAKE A RESERVATION, even as far as a month ahead of time, so you do not miss out!)  There is a very large menu here, making it nearly impossible to narrow down what you want to order.  Of course, you have the Thai dishes that you would normally see at any Thai restaurant, but you also have their specialty Northern Thai menu, which is a MUST to order from (taken advice from Anthony Bourdain!).

Our order:
-We ordered the satay as our appetizer, which was DELICIOUS, tender, and flavorful, with the perfect peanut sauce to pair it with.  It was not chewy or dry at all, as from other restaurants in our experience.
-The Pad Thai was very good, with generous and large pieces of shrimp, and I would say better in flavor than your average restaurant.
-From the Northern menu, we ordered the Khao Soi... I love Thai curries, and this was by far the best that I have ever had!  The duck was perfectly cooked and crispy, the curry itself, despite looking heavy, was actually very light on the stomach, and the flavor was just slightly spicy and not overpowering.  The curry and coconut flavor paired perfectly with the egg noodles that came with it, and I am positive would taste amazing over some fried rice.

We wished that we could try more, but the dishes were very large and could be shared between a few people each, so we will have to wait for our next trip here to try the Panang curry and some of the other dishes!

Bonus: lots of parking around!"}
{"text":"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers! (Side Note: Got hit up for change once again in the the parking lot.)"}
{"text":"This place is located in the middle of a strip mall, off the strip...strange I know, but totally worth the taxi ride! Definitely thee best place to have Thai food in Vegas, if not the entire USA!

The drunken noodles are delicious...full of flavor and spices. They come in many varieties too...a friend had the duck while on another visit, I opted for the soft shell crab drunken noodles. I'm craving for it now as I am typing this!

The crispy rice appetizer is a must try...such a unique dish with a spicy-sour kick to it. It's really unlike anything I've ever eaten! I'm also a big fan of the Thai beef salad...the cuts of beef they use are so tender and of good quality. 

For dessert, of course you need to get the sticky rice with mango + a side of coconut ice cream. Heavenly. 

Staff is courteous, attentive, and efficient. They gladly offer to call cabs for their patrons so you can be right on your way once you're done eating."}
{"text":"This place is like a hole in the wall, but wow, the food is amazing! Service is also great. It's fairly spacious in there, even though it doesn't look like it.

We have been here 3 times now during our recent Vegas trips. & each time was consistent! It is definitely authentic and their spice level is really based off their Thai chili, which can get very spicy. 

We always get the Garlic Prawns shrimp, kinda pricey, but cannot find this anywhere else with the flavors! It's shareable, for the most part lol.

My hubby usually gets their lad na and I have tried their pad this and their boat noodles. You don't even need to add anything to it, but I just added a little bit of spice.

I had a rough night the night prior bc we were our celebrating my friends bachelorette party, so I settled for soup. I felt like this soup gave me some life afterwards! Lol.

This is one of our places we always have to stop in every year we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of my employees and we had an outstanding time. We were able to have a fantastic array of items and each person walked away spending a little less than $35 with tax and tip included. 

There was this one prawn dish with a spicy chili verde-like sauce on top (picture included). It was unreal delicious. Unreal. 

My one gripe is that the start of service was really slow and that's after we waited almost an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"For Thai food in the Vegas area, it's fantastic. For Thai food in general, it's okay.

Despite being off the strip and in a secluded plaza, Lotus of Siam is hyped up by almost any Vegas native/frequenter who recommends Thai food to you. The head chef is a chef who formerly worked at the Wynn, so it's easy to see why people are excited about it. The place is usually packed with people, so reservations might be recommended (although we just walked in and had no problem getting seated).

The food itself isn't bad. It's chock full of flavor, but I can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had considering each dish is in the double digits. (Not unusual for Vegas.) We ordered the Pad Thai and sea bass with drunken noodles with two Thai iced teas; everything was decent, but not worth the money, in my opinion.

Lotus of Siam is worth checking out if you're craving some Thai food while in Vegas, but keep your expectations lower if you come from an area that is familiar with Thai food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow this place did not disappoint at all and was better than I expected.  Came with a decent sized group so we got to try a few dishes and almost all of them were really good.  The dishes came out faster than I expected which was great since we have impatient little kids.  Make reservations b/c this place is crazy busy on the weekends.

Recommended:
Seabass in drunken noodles
khao soi
Thai Beef Salad
Garlic Shrimp
Thum Ka Noon - jackfruit with pork

Decent:
Softshell crab with drunken noodles: too little crab
Crispy duck penang - Crispy duck is good but penang curry is like any other red curry at other places
Nua yum katiem - spicy and not as good as the other beef salad
Nam Kao tod - good flavors but not the best appetizer"}
{"text":"first time eating here. a friend said this place is great! he was right! service frienly fast and the food was great! great taste and large portions. also a good  value! i will be back"}
{"text":"Hit this place with a date. Looks tiny from the outside but opens up into a pretty decent sized place. I enjoyed the food, ordered 10 spicy and it wasn't really that hot, but good flavor. I had some Fish and the girl had same. I would like to work my way through the menu here. So you will see some updates!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this restaurant fool you, the inside is much more pleasant to the eyes. I decided to try this place as I was craving Thai on my previous  trip to Vegas, came here based on Yelp reviews. The food was amazing, the Chilean Sea Bass drunken noodles were my absolute favorite. My only disappointment was when I returned a month later, they were closed for construction due to flooding damage is what I read, hope it's been reopened since September"}
{"text":"The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out."}
{"text":"Popular spot easy to miss if you dont know where you are going or not in a taxi. Good food, service can suffer if its very busy but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Honestly,  myself and the 2 people with  me had such high expectations because of all the reviews.  All 3 of us thought it was ok,  nothing more.   Two of the dishes we wanted on  the northern specialty menu weren't available.   I've had amazing Thai and this wasn't  amazing.  After talking to some locals,  they said the other,  smaller location was the better one for sure.  The one Anthony Bourdain went to.  The dinner at Hell's Kitchen the next  day made up for my disappointment!"}
{"text":"While I wrote a 5-star review for the original \"Lotus of Siam,\" I (unfortunately) cannot rate this, their newest location, nearly as well. I'll go into more detail below, but to summarize, the prices have gone up, portions have gone down, and the quality of the food is not what it was just nine months ago when they were in their original spot. Yes, there are still a some absolutely amazing dishes left on the menu, and the service is still really good as well, but I would sat that this is no longer a 5-star experience. Here's why:

1) The food: Hit and miss. We ordered some \"tom kah kai\" soup, \"crispy duck khao soi,\" \"kha nom jean nam ngyow\" (which I ordered the last time I ate here), and \"kang renu nakorn.\" The crispy duck khao soi, Lotus's signature dish, was, of course, amazing. It's totally worth the $30+, and is perfectly prepared and flavored. However, we were less than impressed with all three of our other dishes. 

To begin, even though we ordered all 4 dishes at a \"spice level 5\" (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the most spicy), they all came out at varying levels of spice. The crispy duck had almost no heat to it, and the soup was closer to an 8 or 9 (super spicy). The other two dishes were somewhere in the middle. Yes, the duck was still amazing without any spice, but I think that a restaurant that prides itself on serving dishes according to patrons' heat tolerances should be more careful about spice consistency. 

Also, while the \"kha nom jean nam ngyow\" was absolutely amazing the last time I had it, it was pretty lackluster this time. Before, it came out as more of a stew or curry. This time, it was very watery, appearing more like a \"pho\" dish with red broth than a curry. There was also a lot less of it than last time. The \"kang renu nakorn\" was also too watery to be considered a curry and was just so/so for taste. 

2) The prices: Lotus of Siam's owners must have really let the restaurant's fame get to their heads, because prices have jumped way up from the last time I was here. That would be fine if the quality of the dishes matched the cost, but aside from the crispy duck, the fairly average taste does not warrant spending $70+ for two people without any drinks.

3) The service: very attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu, and did a great job packing up our leftovers. 

All in all, while not a bad dining experience, I was a bit disappointed with the jump in prices and drop in food quality since the last time I visited. The crispy duck khao soi is still a phenomenal dish, but I can't really recommend anything else, and the great service does not really make up for that."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I ever had anywhere in the states.  found it on yelp. the outside looks sketchy in an old shopping mall, but the inside was a nice surprise. you cannot judge a book by its cover. we ordered four dishes and shared, drunken beef noodle, pad Thai, chicken panang curry, and beef stir fry with green beans. For dessert, try the fried banana with coconut ice cream, it is divine. I don't think you can go wrong. we tried coming back the next day, but it was a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night, so went across the street to Arawan Bistro."}
{"text":"Best Thai food i have ever had. If you are craving Thai food you really need not go any place else in Vegas. I sampled their pad Thai and what I had was properly treated ingredients with a flawless execution. Minus half one star for the ambiance. Looks a bit dated."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Crispy duck was on point per usual. The garlic prawns weren't as good as they have been in the past. The Tom yum Kai was delicious too."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on Sunday evening 10/24/10 and enjoyed a wonderful,authentic Thai dinner that included many highlights and some truly amazing dishes with very few misses.

The restaurant itself is located in and aged strip mall off of The Strip on Sahara Ave. and the decor is dated and worn with walls lined by photos of noted past diners including Drew Barrymore, Mario Batali, etc.. I can't decide if this added to or detracted from the ambiance but it's nice to see this chef and cuisine gettings it's rightful due notoriety.

The food at Lotus of Siam is the star and I was by most accounts dazzled. The menu itself is dizzying large with so many different dishes that's it's overwhelming so if you're unsure of what to order then rely on your server to help navigate this menu as they will happily make recommendations that are on point. All dishes are prepared at your requested spice level from 1-10 so be specific. My wife choose a mild level #2 while I opted for a Spicy level #7. This also worked well when moving back and forth between dishes from mild to spicy and back again.

Our Food:

Appetizers:

Chicken Satay (Spice level #2) - Simple but beautifully balanced with a sweet peanut sauce and a cool crisp pickled cucumber salad.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice w/ minced, sour sausage, peanuts, ginger, green onions, fresh chilies & lime juice & ) (Spice level # 7) - The crispy & crunchy texture is wonderful but this dish definitely takes a little getting used to. My first reaction was \"This is really dry\", but when combined with the sliced cucumber and fresh cabbage garnishes it was balanced and addictive.

Entrees: (served w/ steamed white rice)

Charbroiled Prawns w/ Spicy & Tamarind Sauce (Spice level # 2) - This was a simple, perfect shellfish presentation with butterflied prawns still in their shells, simply charbroiled and served with two contrasting sauces of spicy vs. sweet & sour.

Thum-Ka-Noon (Pounded Young Jackfruit Shredded)
(Spice level # 7) - This Northern Thai dish was hands down my favorite of the night by far. Shredded jackfruit, ground, sour pork & spicy tomato sauce & herbs. This was so focused and satisfying. Wow!

Koi Soy (Issan Beef Tartare) (Spice level # 7) - I wanted to love this dish but I really was disappointed. The cubed, raw beef was fresh and clearly of good quality with a nice texture provided by the rice powder but I was so overwhelmed with the flavor of lime juice that I couldn't even decipher the actual primary taste of Beef Tartare.

Dessert:

Fresh Mango w/ Sticky Rice & Coconut Ice Cream - 
The mango & sticky rice themselves were awesome. I love the savoriness of this dessert combination however I was not so much a fan of the coconut ice cream as I found the texture icy and the flavor lacking any distinct natural coconut profile. I asked our server if it was made in-house and he stated they bring it in from California. It did provide some welcome temperature contrast to the cool, tart mango and the sweet, warm sticky rice but otherwise it was completely forgettable. 

It's worth drawing attention to the exemplary service here as it truly is by any measure fantastic. The front of the house staff were very welcoming, attentive and provided many good menu suggestions. Our water & drink glasses were never even half empty and plates arrived and were cleared at perfect intervals.

I'd love to return again and try many more dishes along with the hope of finding more magnificent Thai treasures. If your truly love Thai food then you must try Lotus of Siam atleast once if not ten times. 
It really deserves your attention."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the rave reviews on yelp.  I especially wanted to try the \"Garlic Pepper Fried Shrimp\" & it did not disappoint.  Really tasty!  We also ordered \"Tofu Panang Curry,\" \"Seafood with Drunken Noodles,\" \"Papaya Salad,\" & \"Combo Fried Rice.\"  I was amazed at the creaminess of the Panang curry, & the Combo fried rice was addicting.

Sadly, we didn't get to try the \"Mango with Sticky Rice\" because we were just stuffed after eating all that food.

We were there on a Monday night, without reservations.  Waited about 1/2 hour for a table, which was not bad at all, considering how crowded the place was.  Will definitely come here again, & try other dishes.  The menu here is pretty extensive. Would love to try the \"Thai Iced Tea\" next time.  While waiting at the bar for a table, we saw the servers constantly making those drinks left & right!"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing.  I loved every minute of it.  In fact, I would compare the food at this restaurant to cuisine I ate during my time in Thailand.  It was authentic feeling and had a home-cooked taste.  We ordered the whole fish, shrimp, noodles, soup, and pineapple rice for dessert.  It was more than enough for 6 people and the price was reasonable.  I plan on coming back every time I am in Vegas.  Another reason to avoid the strip and discover the rest of Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was so excited because of all the good reviews but I was very disappointed.

Overall, the food was very expensive and the portions were tiny.  I didn't think it tasted better than the other Thai restaurants I've been to.

Maybe I came on an off day too because the service was extremely slow and a little rude."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet, and was very pleased. The buffet offered a choice of about 12 items and the place was very busy, ensuring fresh food for all. I recall a couple of curries, two or three noodle dishes and several entrees along with soup, spring rolls. As it was buffet, I didn't expect much service other than keeping my water glass full, and they managed that. 

An excellent choice for a fast, inexpensive and delicious lunch."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant I've ever tried! Don't waste your time on buffets when you have this gem in the dessert. The location seemed very unassuming but the inside was brightly decorated and spacious! All the dishes we tried was colorful and delicious! My favorite had to be the crispy duck curry. I don't know how the duck retained it's crispiness inside the thick curry. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas for the weekend."}
{"text":"We were really excited this place but couldn't get timely reservations. Id suggest calling about a week in advance. Figured we give it a shot and luckily we didn't have to wait too long. Very flavorful food and fast service! We ordered fish cake appetizer, musaman curry, pad thai and kang ka noon (from the northern menu) and shared."}
{"text":"Loved it! This was my second time visiting and I got the panang beef. I got it with medium heat and it was perfect. The flavors were well developed and would definitely order again. My wife got the duck panang with medium heat and while it was really good, we weren't sure if it was worth double the price compared to chicken and beef panang. 

For desert, I got the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. The coconut ice cream was more icy than creamy. The sticky rice with the ice cream was great! I definitely recommend having the ice cream with sticky rice. The hot/cold temperatures and different textures were nice. Overall, I highly recommend and if I were to return, I would likely order the same thing."}
{"text":"It was a sketchy place as many have stated but great once you get in. The food was overall great. We were given  a recommendation for crispy rice and it was not good but the curry and the pad Thai was awesome. Made finitely recommend the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I was in Vegas for a week long conference and I was recommended this place by three different people. Two of which were Lyft drivers who I didn't even ask for a recommendation. Me and a group of my colleagues decided to go right when they open since we heard there is always a line to sit down. You walk in and there are awards everywhere. To be honest this place lives up to the hype. service is good and the food is freaking delicious! It has a very cool atmosphere and I can not wait until I get to go back!"}
{"text":"The best thai food in Vegas. I leave my house in Ca early enough to beat down the door at 1130 when they open. They lunch buffet is the best. I dream about that duck soup. They have a variety of veggie and meat entrees to please everyone.  They also have nice selection of Reislings to wash down that spicy food"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!
Every food item we ordered came out perfect!!
Make sure to order crispy duck Panang!!! We had two orders lol
I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat more!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Was packed to the gills on a Thursday night at 8:30, so that gave me hope.  Last place we tried on the west end nearly did us in, so fingers crossed, we jumped! So happy we gave this place a try.  Food was incredible, service was a tad slow, but that was probably because they were slammed with people.  No biggie, we had just gotten off a plane so it gave us time to relax. BF had the seafood with the flat noodles and I had the pad thai."}
{"text":"First time trying Thai and it was DELICIOUS! The options were vast and the customer service was wonderful! Glad I found something different off the strip!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in Vegas. 
Awful & scary neigberhood. 
Expect Great Food, ok Service & really High prices!
Sticky Rice with mango is to die for."}
{"text":"Great food, portions are a bit smaller than other Thai places. We had the spicy fried rice (level 6) and Kraw Pao (level 8). No where close to Thai spicy, even at those levels however very tasty. This place is slightly off the strip but quite large and packed with customers. Has pictures of famous people all over. The staff is super nice and quite attentive. Large selection of food and drinks. Great for families, couples and/or large groups."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food! I noticed that 90% of the people who review this place only order about 10% of the dishes they offer (and the menu is about 10 pages long), so I decided to try two dishes that were not mentioned very often, including one more traditional Thai dish, and one of the more rare \"Northern Thai\" specialties. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit, and I'll try to address some of the things that other reviews mentioned as well.

1) Everyone seems to talk about how long the wait is for this place. However, if you come for lunch, especially early in the week, you will probably be able to get right in. I arrived at 10:30AM on a Monday (they open at 11:00AM), and I was all by myself in line until a couple minutes before they opened. By the time I left around noon, the restaurant still wasn't even 1/3 full. Do yourself a favor and either a) come for lunch (although they only serve lunch on weekdays, and they did say that Friday lunch can get busy), or b) make a reservations (just be sure to make the reservation at least 4-5 days out). 

2) The service was *on point*! My server was speedy and attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable about the food, helped me with my allergy (if you are allergic to milk, like me, very few of their dishes have dairy in them, and the ones that do are mostly desert or drinks), and kept my water glass full. I was very impressed with this.

3) The menu is HUGE. This could be good or bad for you, but I like having a ton of choices. You can find everything from traditional Pad Thai and curries to more rare \"Northern Thai\" dishes that are somewhat Burmese in flavor. They also have a really big drink menu, including a ton of wines. 

4) The food was excellent. For my traditional dish (so I had a point of comparison), I had a bowl of Tom Yum soup. It was excellent: perfectly spiced (you can choose how spicy you want it) and had a TON of chicken. Super yummy. For my exotic choice, I decided on \"Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow,\" a pork stew over rice noodles. The dish was like nothing I have ever had at a Thai Restaurant before, but reminded me a little of Burmese. It included ground pork with a spicy tomato/chili sauce over noodles and garnished with bean sprouts and cabbage. I was pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend this dish. 

5) The prices were also reasonable: both of my dishes came out to under $20 with tax and tip. Many reviews talk about this place being expensive, but there are really just a handful of dishes (mostly the famous ones) that are pricey. To be honest, I didn't see a huge difference in price between Lotus of Siam and my favorite Thai places back home, except for the few ultra-popular specialty dishes. 

6) The restaurant is HUGE, inviting, and clean (including the bathroom). You can easily take the bus here from the strip (took about 25 minutes from the MGM Grand), but they also have lots of free parking. 

I can't wait to come back and try more dishes here: there are about 20 I am looking forward to trying. I'll be sure to update when I do. For now, you should really visit and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I had the crispy duck with drunken noodles, tom yum soup, and Thai tea. While I love the crispy duck and Thai tea, I do not like the tom yum much. This place is a must-visit for any foodie tourists."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  Tom Kha Kai soup, crispy rice, spicy glass noodle salad, and pineapple fried rice were noteworthy.  

Service is quick, although you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great James Beard Award Winning Thai restaurant. Had a great meal here."}
{"text":"So many celebrities on your walls. What am I?  Cottage cheese?  

I ask you all. What's more important. Food or service?  I would say food but  I'm biased.

I'm not a pain in the ass. But a brother can only take so much. I'm like Rambo walking into town all nice and what not, and you keep pushing me, pushing me, till you draw... First Blood. 

It's not that bad. I didn't get water hosed. But damn are these dudes ornery.  I didn't break up your monarchy or destroyed any semblance of democracy you might be holding onto, nor did I call you a \"Shim\"

I just made a reso, ordered from your baller wine list (German and Austrian) and ask for basic table maintenance. Plates cleared so I don't gotta stack it on my head or lap.  Asking for a chopstick should not be paramount to you to tilting your head back as if  I'm giving you a table side abortion. 

I know you Thais and Philippinos like using the spoon and fork thing. That's bad ass. But don't deny your ethnicity. I know you guys be using chopsticks in the closet.  

Anyways. Food is dope. Only reason to go unless you are Anthony Bourdain. In that case, they physically put a server under your table to suck your Bouchon.  Just kidding. 

Everything tastes like something my aunties would not send back. It's a huge menu and it comes out fast. Totally and utterly delicious. I just want someone to treat me like I get treated when I'm in Thailand. Without the surprise penis."}
{"text":"I don't even know why I'm rating this place because everyone knows it's beyond exceptional.  Visited Vegas and had to check this place out. Made reservations - suggest you do the same. I still crave the flavors of Thai I tasted since coming back to Philly and I know I cannot find those duplicate flavors here in Philly. So Vegas I'll be back for Thai food. 

First wine selection is GREAT. Ordered a bottle of a nice Riesling as Riesling pairs very well with spicy food. Wine was great. 

Food - ordered a soup with shrimp and clear broth. It was spicy and good. Ordered some spring rolls for my daughter who likes basic Asian food - she's boring but I love her, she's a pre teen so don't hold her food tastes against her yet. Spring rolls were good. Then I ordered garlic prawns, chicken pad Thai, duck drunken noodles and duck panang. Omg duck was phenomenal. Panang was my favorite and best I ever had. My mouth is watering thinking about it. The garlic prawns were good but I think I imagined them to be more decadent since it appears from reviews they are the claim to fame. Next time I go I'll skip them and just order more duck dishes!!!!

Vegas is lucky to have this place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Many a person recommended this place, including the staff at é. The wine list is impressive and the food was good to very good.

Yum Woon Sen: Such a great dish -- my favorite is still Thai Square in DC -- Siam's really didn't do much for me.

Nam Prik Ong: a chili dip with ground pork, tomato and dried spice -- it was not the best thing I ever ate, but it was quite good.

Drunken noodles with Sea Bass: the best dish we had, the fish was cooked perfectly and the noodles were delicious -- my only complaint was the portion size, especially given the price.

Beef jerky Issan style: great flavor, just a little dry and difficult to eat (granted, that could be why they call it jerky!)

Sticky rice with fried banana: delicious!

I was really looking forward to this meal, and it was good -- but a little less than memorable."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night. We have relatives that live in Las Vegas and have wanted to try this place for a while. The food was excellent - by far the best Thai food I have ever had in the USA, Europe, or Asia. (That said, while I have traveled in Asia - I have not been to Thailand.) In addition to great food - the wine selection was amazing. The wine list is very extensive and can be very expensive, but there are some bottles in the $30-60 range. (In other words, you can get a special bottle of wine, but you can also just buy a good bottle too.

I can't wait to eat here again!  We definitely plan to go back before we head home to DC in a few days! (Maybe tonight? Or tomorrow?)"}
{"text":"Definitely not your run of the mill Thai restaurant. Nothing looks particularly special about the place itself. The decor isn't fancy, the service is good but nothing spectacular, and it's in a sort of weird location. But the food will blow you away. Best Pad Thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"You guys have heard all the hype. All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!

I've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..

Places like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says \"this is drunken noodles.\" At LoS, it still says  \"this is drunken noodles\", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)

Whenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!"}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place, and she was absolutely right.  The Nam Kao Tod appetizer was bursting with a variety of flavors and something you don't find at most Thai places.  The cabbage in the dish was so tender and delicious!  Also recommend the Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab.  Wash it all down with a nice Thai beer and you'll be happy.  Place was packed when where were there late on a Monday night.  Careful, cause the neighborhood is a bit sketchy at night."}
{"text":"***warning*** my beer goggles are on. The waitress Kao was excellent in the bar. She got us buzzing and when we got to the food it was excellent."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional food that's representative of a cuisine general audiences might not be familiar with. Northern Thailand borders Laos and Myanmar, so there's going to be a lot of similar savory and sour themes going on in its dishes. The chef's specials are brilliant: the crispy duck khao soi and the garlic prawns are absolutely incredible and worth the long wait. One of the best restaurants worth visiting in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here because of Anthony Bourdain!

We were thrown off at first by the location and how sketchy it is, but don't feat!! This place is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. I'm VERY picky with my Thai food(you can blame my Thai mama) so that's a lot coming from me. I went with my family and ordered musaman curry, yum neau(beef salad), chicken sautee, fish cakes, sticky rice, and a dish that's like Thai salsa, etc. You gotta believe me that we were not disappointed at all. My mom was very happy to see that they added in Northern Thai dishes, because most Thai restaurants don't! I laugh at everyone who goes to this restaurant and orders pad thai, there's so much more deliciousness than pad thai!! Service was super slow and they barely came by to check up on us. We waited for our food for 30 minutes, but it was all worth it. The ambiance is very nice. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends that will be heading to Las Vegas in the future!

If you want something similar in San Francisco, go to Osha Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've been too!  Crispy duck, garlic prawns, etc.  We had the greatest hits based on yelp recommendations.  Service was standard, ambience was typical of a family restaurant.  What you really come for is the food quality and great flavor of Thai cuisine.  This place delivers on the food in an exciting and bold way.  No under seasoning found in any of our dishes.  Highly recommend.  Wish we had more in our party so we could try more items."}
{"text":"Service was nice! Food was delicious! I was so happy! I would recommend to my thai food lover friends!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food , the dishes where excellent, worth the trip, we had the curry duck exquisite, garlic shrimp Wow"}
{"text":"WOW. This place which is located in the middle of a huge strip mall took my breath away. The minute my friend and I walked in to the restaurant after a long day of walking on Las Vegas Blvd, were surprised to see how big this place was inside. It was about 5:30 in the evening and half the tables were already taken. By the time we finished our dinner, an hour later, the restaurant was full. 

Inside, there is a room with a huge selection of wines. The two seating areas were nicely done, typical to most Thai restaurants. The menu had good selection of authentic Thai food and French/American wine. The fried rice that I ordered with basil, tofu and vegetables was done right. The flavors were adequate and of good taste. Fried rolls for appetizer were standard fare but not too fried which is good. Just the right amount of crisp. The frozen banana dessert tasted good just like at most Thai restaurants. 

Lotus of Siam is a local Yelp favorite and as you can see from the other reviews, its averages a little over 4 stars. Great place with great food and service."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have been to in Las Vegas... definetely will return on my my next visit to vegas"}
{"text":"Best Thai food outside of Thailand. My go to dishes are crispy duck with Thai basil, garlic prawns, pork larb salad, and the House special catfish. Try to come for lunch, or right when they open or before they close, because peak time will be over an hour wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place  out because of all the great  reviews. It was just okay Thai food. I've had better in the Bay Area. Don't  know why all the hype. I ate here with three other friends and ordered a lot of items. The papaya salad was a little disappointing - flavors were not robust as I like it, kind of boring.  Before we were able to order, it took an extremely long time before the waiter came over to take our order. And once our food arrived, we hardly saw the waiter. We had to flag him down for the bill.  Okay food and lackluster service but glad that I  tried this place out."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Lotus of Siam after hearing so many good things about this restaurant. It certainly lived up to the hype. The menu has a pretty wide variety of options. Make sure you order a few Northern Thai dishes (the Khao Soi is a must order!). Hard to find anything more authentic than those. Overall the family ordered Khao Soi, Green Curry Chicken, Kang Ka Noon, and the special Thai fried fish. All were excellent.
Our waitress-April was wonderfully friendly and helpful!
Next time i'm in Vegas, i'll definitely be returning to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"This is worth a visit.  It is in a seriously strange group of buildings though.  Must get a reservation and DO NOT be late!  If you are early you can try out some of the other establishments, but don't get anything on you.  I will leave it up to you to find out what goes down in that town."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! The service will exceed your expectations! Don't listen to people refer to this as \"A little hole in the wall\". It is a nice sophisticated Thai Restaurant.  NOT your Thai restaurant down the street, the Pin Kaow, the Archi's etc. This is you \"Are we in Thailand eating like KINGS & Queens spot!?\" The food is unstoppable! Don't you dare go there ordering Pad Thai and your common Thai Foods. Have them order for you! The Crispy duck is incredible! Stop by here and get blown away!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I've eaten here many times since my last review. Everything on the menu is great, even if it is pricy. The quality is sublime."}
{"text":"With so many reviews, I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said.  

It I could only eat at one Thai restaurant the rest of my life, this would be the place. The Pad Thai is perfect, not overly sweet like you find at too many places.  The curry dishes have are more complex than I've had at any other place.  The shrimp are always fresh, good size and perfectly cooked.  I can't believe I waited so long to try the crispy duck panang curry - will never get chicken @ LOS again!  

The service is not as good as the food - but if ever a restaurant deserves five star, this is it."}
{"text":"Great service and food... they patiently waited on our huge party of 18. Big hungry guys ate up everything. Crispy duck, pad thai, fried pork ribs. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I love the lunch buffet, it's a great value! They have this amazing beef soup on it and I love to dip the shrimp chips in it! The pad Thai and the tempura on the buffet are also surprisingly tasty. As for dinner, I really like the crispy duck Penang. Very extensive wine list too. It's always a challenge for me to order dinner b/c the menu is so extensive - it's a good thing though."}
{"text":"HI folks, Its Richard Emanuele , I cant tell you enough, if your looking for some incredible Thai food . Lotus of Siam is the best in town. If your a local or visiting Vegas and craving some excellent Thai food its a must!!!! Please don't judge the restaurant by its decor, the food speaks for itself. I recommend you make reservations or there can be a long wait."}
{"text":"Take a few friends, get there 30 minutes before they open. Don't know if they take reservations. Order many dishes and pass them and share around the table. Only way to eat here because everything is good and you will want to try all of it."}
{"text":"Finally made it off the Strip to visit the best Thai restaurant that we've ever had the pleasure of dining in.  Got off the bus and thought we were in the wrong place until we figured out that the restaurant was in the back of the strip mall. Glad we had read to not be put off by the location!
The local gal at the table beside us made some great recommendations, or should I say we just ordered everything that they had on their table: crispy rice appetizer, red curry noodles, pad thai, garlic pepper prawns, beef satay.  Oh, to have room for more!  Great German wines too - perfect to cut the heat in the curry dishes.
Could be the reason we book our next trip to Vegas. But we'll come back with several people in tow so we can order twice as much food to taste more of what this fabulous restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is just so awesome. The quality of the food is so fresh and its so TASTY.... Yummy yummy....  This place was like packed and i see everyone enjoying their meal. Its probably one of the best thai restaurant in the United States. Loved it"}
{"text":"We've had been looking forward to eating here for a long time since we came to Las Vegas earlier this week. Strongly recommend making a reservation. 

We decided to try the red snapper, garlic pawn,  crispy pork belly with peppers, and a couple other dishes. The garlic pork spare ribs and red snapper is my favorite. We now understand why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass."}
{"text":"Certainly, the location comes across as the most beaten down strip mall in a city nicknamed Lost Wages.  Come here in the heat of summer and likely you will feel that you and your party have stepped into a Post Nuclear Bomb movie: your skin feels like 1,000 degrees and glowing. So the food would have to be the draw.  And it is!  This has some of the best Thai food in the ole' U.S. of A. (note: the original restaurant was in Hollywood, another city that has seen better days, so I have actually been eating here for two decades!)   The curry here is special, with the right level of heat.  So enjoy those beads of sweat on your forehead, because they will cool you down when you walk back out into the furnace!"}
{"text":"I wasn't as wowed this time around because I knew what I'd be in for, but OMFG!  I can't get enough of this place.  I'm definitely a fan.

I tried a few of new dishes, based on fellow Yelpers, hoping to rant about them, as they did: the spicy chicken wings, the crispy duck in panang, and the beef jerky.  The spicy chicken wings are dripping and delicious.  The duck was good, but we thought that the short ribs in panang (from our last visit) was better.  The jerky was reminiscent of Filipino tapa, but less tangy.

Again, we had the garlic prawns.  Wow!  You can put them damn things in the freezer and bake them the next day to the same yummy goodness.  This time the seabass on drunken noodle was good, but the fish was as crisp and juicy as our first endevour.  

I do have to note that we did \"take out\" this time around.  I don't know if that made a difference on the quality.  They gave us a 40 minute wait time.  We got there at exactly 40 mins, but it took them another 10 minutes to complete our order, once we arrived."}
{"text":"You know, Lotus of Siam seems like one of those great things that they just happen to forget when they were writing the Bible. I came recently and I must say, I'm LOVING the remodeling. It's so bright and spacious now. But don't let the extra space fool you because you will still need a reservation to escape the extremely long wait. 

1st place winner: Garlic Prawns: I'm not sure exactly what it's called, but this place is famous for it apparently. What they do is that they have these prawns dipped in a light, garlic tempura sauce and then deep fried. Okay, one: it's deep fried, and two it's garlic with prawns. What could possibly go wrong? It's SUPER delicious! Like the shells from the prawns cracks off the meat and becomes super crispy. I personally think the crispy skins are the best part of it because it just has this awesome crunch and then you have this huge explosion of flavor in your mouth... (I just realized how wrong that last part sounds... oh well!) 
2nd Place: the Shrimp Pad Thai: I was really surprised about the execution of the Pad thai. Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection.
3rd Place: all other food items. I can't really go into depth on what else you should order here because I'm already drooling enough as is after explaining the prawns.... hehe

The price is right and it won't leave your wallet crippled, which is excellent because everything else in Vegas is supperrrr expensive! If you want a breather from the strip and delicious food, come here and murder your diet. It is sin city after all. :)"}
{"text":"\"Do not judge a book by its cover\".  The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole-in-the-wall type of place located in a shady/seedy looking strip mall but once you walk inside be prepared for a long wait if you don't already have reservations. 

Once seated, we ordered the Tom Kha soup, garlic prawns (where you eat the crispy shrimp shell like a chip), crispy duck penang and pad see ew.

Probably the best Thai food I've had so far...and apparently everyone else has the same opinion judging by the crowded restaurant and the walls covered in celebrity pictures with Saipan, the owner.

I'll definitely be back.  There's so much more menu to explore!"}
{"text":"It may not look like much from the outside, but the inside is nice. The food is great and the staff are friendly. Their pad thai is incredible (which is an understatement). The Khao Soi is also very good. To top it off, its hard to beat the price. My only hesitation is that I have not eaten at too many thai restaurants and so maybe there is something better out there."}
{"text":"Amazing food at this place, and a huge wine selection. Try the drunken noodles at least once!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai cusine. We have a fine feast every time that we in Las Vegas. The Stuffed Chicken Wing (Angel Wings), Drunken Noodles and Yellow Curry are favorites. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time we go to Las Vegas we come here.  This time it turned out that the place had uhmm.... grown slightly :)  Last time we were there this was a tiny restaurant but now it's rather giant and the line up to it was at a glance more than 40 ppl.  LOL. MAKE A RESERVATION! 
Well, we come for the sweet and sour chicken which is perfect here.  The sauce is perfectly spectacular and they make it just as spicy as you want which for me is \"tears in your eyes, flames in your mouth hot\" :) .  The chicken quality is great -- fresh and perfect.  The service is great -- the staff were very attentive and nice.  I'm very happy to say that despite having grown this place had not lost the quality of its food which is a HUGE relief since it's one of our favorite Thai places."}
{"text":"Getting a reservation was hard...for some reason always got a busy signal or continued ringtone....when they finally answered it was like hitting the jackpot.
Once we got there we ordered the garlic prawns, crispy rice, braised shortribs in panang, and crispy duck with drunken noodles.....it was fantastic overall.
The crispy rice is more of a acquired taste...I like it but not for everyone as it is sour and salty but a good starter to encourage the appetite. The crispy prawns were amazing...my favorite part of this dish were the shells that had so much flavor. The crispy duck was the perfect level of spicy for me (I ordered 7 out of 10 and like things spicy) and the crispy part was super crispy and the moist parts were succulent all coated with a basil sauce that was to die for. Finally the short ribs in panang sauce was delicious. The sauce was flavorful and the meat tender.
Definitely worth the trip even out to the complex in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"I FINALLY got to try the famous Lotus of Siam. Overall, it was pretty awesome.

Location/venue: It's located in a seriouly shady part of town in a mall I would never go to alone. The venue like...an old tired Chinese restaurant. 

Food: I was actually slightly disappointed that not everything was out of this world delicous...here's the breakdown
-Crispy duck with panang curry: This was hands down the star of our meal. It's one of their signature dishes and expectations were high...and they totally delivered. Duck was perfectly crispy and juicy and the curry! OH EM GEE SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. Perfectly balanced, creamy without being heavy. Good to the very last drop. We might as well have just licked the plate.
-Garlic prawns: Another signature dish that was very good, though not as amazing as the duck with panang curry. the shrimp meat and shell are fried separately, which surprisingly makes everything yummy crunchy and edible. The shells were possibly even better than the meat of the prawns. 
-Soft shell crab with drunken noodle: this was disapointing, especially after the first two dishes. The soft shell crab was a bit soggy and the noodles were super soggy. In fact the noodles were all stuck together in sticky soggy bricks. I feel like I must have gotten an anomaly.
-Sai Oua (norther style sausage): don't get this. it's just...a sausage. It wasn't special. I mean, if you know what it is and you like it, sure. But otherwise, it was super disappointing and just not very good.
-Fried banana with coconut ice cream: So crispy, so yummy, the banana and the coconut ice cream were perfect complements!
-Mango with sticky rice: Mango was beautifully deliciously silky ripe. sticky rice was  perfectly chewy and yummy. Both of the desserts were delicious. I was way beyond capacity full by dessert and I still finished every last bite of dessert!

If you come for the duck/curry, prawns, and dessert, it's PERFECT. 5 starts. However, I am disappointed that aside from the two signature dishes the rest of the entrees were any good. Their menu is actually quite extensive...wonder if how much of the menu is actually at the level of their 2 signature dishes?"}
{"text":"Who knew I would have a compelling reason to go to Vegas just to get Thai food, something that I could literally find every few blocks where I live.

But before you get excited to visit this place, you'll have to find it. You really can't see the restaurant from the street, but once you turn into a plaza and notice a huge empty parking lot, you are definitely getting warmer. 

I went with a lot of choices as advised by yelpers- the prawns with drunken noodles, the crispy duck in panang curry (it's been weeks since I've been but the name has stuck with me) and the last was a beef dish that I don't quite remember the name. The prawns were gigantic and cooked with such a nice crunch to them. The noodles that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment, even with your white rice! I also loved loved loved the duck. Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).

All in all, it was a delicious meal. It is on the pricier side for lunch but, I personally think it is worth every penny. Don't be shy and ask for more rice if you need something to soak up all that curry. Truly a 5 star for me!"}
{"text":"Nice find thanks to yelp! The area is totally ghetto but inside is quite nice. The staff were all friendly and helped sort through the long menu. I had the prawns on drunken noodles and they were tasty. Get there early and you're in for sure. Food is 3.5 service and atmosphere push me to a 4"}
{"text":"Great place for wine, huge selections of German Riesling and good amount of Japanese sake."}
{"text":"Nam Kao Tod - asked for level 10 spicy and it was just nice. Not crazy spicy, lovely touch of sourness and great crispy texture. Tad salty but had lettuce, cabbage and cucumber to offset this. 

Beef salad with raw eggplant - first time I've ever had raw eggplant. Interesting texture. Seasoned very nicely with lemongrass cutting through. Large chunks of beef that is tender. Bit heavy on the raw onions. Level 10 spicy blows your socks off. 

Drunken noodle with chicken - if you like the taste of basil you'll love this dish. Brilliantly flavoured and great balance of flavours. 

Garlic prawns - so divine. Large and juicy. So glad we tried it. 

One of the best Thai places we've eaten at outside of Thailand for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food ! Don't be fool by the outside, it looks a bit ghetto and small but very spacious inside- very nice service. Pay attention when you order Tom yum - same portion and taste for Tom yum prawn ($27) or Tom gong shrimp ($15) just that the later one has a  bit smaller shrimp- the charbroil beef -nua yum katiem is really tasty! Chicken skewer is good but very small portion..we are in vacation mood so taste is what I give this place 5 stars.. with price - probably 4! But definitely will come back! Note that reservation is highly recommended.. or will be long wait..."}
{"text":"Best...Thai...Food...ever! 

just make sure you order their northern thai dishes, as that's what they specialize in. if you come here to order the pad thai, you're missing the whole point of visiting Lotus of Siam

Prices are very reasonable, the fried banana desert is the bomb! I always make sure to stop by this place whenever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Worth the cab ride off the strip!  Ordered the crispy rice appetizer that other yelpers raved out, pad see yeo with beef, and chicken basil - all really balanced, fresh, and delicious.  Really affordable too, especially compared to eating at the hotels."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype!

First appearance is not what I expected. It looked like some janky hole-in-the-wall spot from the outside. But inside was a pleasant surprise. It's huge. And had a bar area for you to grab a few drinks before dinner.

We arrived at 5:20 pm,10 minutes before they opened and there was already a line of 40 people waiting on be seated. Luckily they had enough tables for us to be seated.

Food was amazing. For a party of 2, we ordered the garlic prawns and the crispy duck in panang curry. I highly recommend both. 

Service was attentive and friendly.

Overall, a great place to enjoy great thai food. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here on my last trip to Las Vegas.  While it is located in a very shady area, the food is ah-mazing.  The inside of the restaurant looks nothing like the outside.  If you're mapping your way to this restaurant, and find yourself sightly nervous because of the inadequate area lighting, you're in the right place.  The restaurant does a good job at sprucing up the atmosphere with white table cloths, and an impressive wine list & glassware.  The food is very authentic and stays true to its Thai flavors and textures.  The restaurant is very busy, I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, not cheap, long wait, foodies give it high praise, so I had hella high expectations - so everything was going against this place. But that panang crispy duck was one of the best dishes of my life. I can't even -- I mean whoa. And I've been to Thailand twice. Just go."}
{"text":"Worth the trip to this strange strip mall. 

We headed there for lunch on a Friday and were quickly seated.

The place is so much bigger than I expected! And they have a pretty amazing wine selection, though we didn't have any on this visit.

The duck curry was the best. We also ordered fried tofu and a pork dry curry which was far spicier than I had wanted but also too good to resist."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a unpopulated shopping plaza away from the main strip of vegas. However it is easy to find and there is plenty of parking. The place stays very busy so I'd call ahead and make a reservation. The food we tried was very good, although portion size wasn't that great. The price was a little on the high side considering the dishes that we ordered, but everything was good."}
{"text":"Just about everything is yummy here and the staff is attentive. 

Best dishes: 
Garlic prawns - super tasty and the shells are nicely seasoned and has a good crunch to it. 
Tom yum koong - the soup was not hot enough but the flavors were there. Tangy and spicy. There was also plenty of shrimps. 

We also had to meat salad, duck, drunken noodle, and basil fried rice. Everything was made well. 

Try to make a reservation when you're coming on a weekend night. This place gets packed! 

If you're waiting for a table, check out the bar in the back."}
{"text":"When we visit Vegas, we make a point to eat here.  I must say our recent dining experience was very disappointing.   We started with papaya salad which was a little too sweet.  The garlic prawns were very greasy, Pad Thai and yellow curry were meh.  Also, the portions are very small compared to our previous visits.  We will be taking a break from coming here."}
{"text":"Luckily we made advanced reservation. I was surprised how big the restaurant was. It had multiple big rooms all filled with customers. The service was attentive and polite. We ordered the Khao Soi, which is crispy duck over egg noodles and curry sauce, chicken larb, which is ground chicken tossed in a spicy, lime sauce, and crispy garlic prawns. The food was tasty, however, it was nothing exceptional for which we would come back. We also thought the food was overpriced- the Khao Soi and garlic prawns were each $27-28. The portion was average. The meal for two cost $77 before tips."}
{"text":"Loved northern burmese food menu there.. too bad they are closed down the nect time i m in town"}
{"text":"You know there has to be something special about this place if people like Mario Batali and Tyler Florence eat here. We started off with the chicken wings. I can bathe in that sauce. The roasted duck curry was really good. It's one of those really good hole-in-the-wall places that totally exceeds expectations. I definitely plan on coming back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"So glad they opened the new location! Same Great food same great service! The Panang Duck and the fried prawns was point per usual! I'm also feeling the new bar area! It's huge! Anyways I'm happy that they're opened back up again in the new spot! See you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had, and I live in L.A.  Unlikely city, unlikely location, a nondescript strip mall on a run-down stretch of Sahara Ave., but oh the food!

I've been here several times now (try to make a couple of visits every time I'm in Vegas, sometimes twice in a day, it's so good).  Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.  

Once, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.  

They have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.  They apparently have a world-class wine list as well, but I haven't tried it; with the heat of Thai food, I always find myself craving a beer.  

Despite all the fancy, big-name restaurants in the city, the meals I have here are always the most memorable."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing Thai food- you get the vibe as you walk in, full and vibrant place, long lines, well off the strip in a somewhat seedy area in the Commercial Center.  I have made it a point of hitting this place for some of the best food in town.  Like it spicy- they are serious but you can opt out.  
Be prepared for a long wait but its worth it.  Or you can get stuff to go and spice it up at home."}
{"text":"This place is great and everyone knows it. Huge menu, big nice place. Come early to beat the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Just a dinner here. Service is great - bunch of people run by our table. Food was good. Portions are not as big as in the Thai St Cafe. $11 a meal. Would've put 4 stars but it fascinates me how this place grew from a whole in the wall to such a big place. Is it all because of celebrities?"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant ever!!! It's authentic, fresh, and of superb quality. It's a hole in the wall, but remarkable food! Staff is attending and very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Only complain is the long wait times....but it's worth the wait. The long wait times says a lot, think about it ;)"}
{"text":"Went to Lotus of Siam because numerous magazine articles proclaimed it \" the best Thai food in America\". Well, maybe it's the best Thai barf in America. What a gross, greasy pile of crap was served to us. And not cheap despite it's location in some out of the way strip mall. Plus, good luck to get a cab to take you back to your hotel.

Red 8 at the Wynn is outstanding for Thai. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Been coming here for more than a decade and have always been pleased.  This isn't like all the corner cafe pad thai joints you see everywhere.  They have a much wider range of Thai dishes than you see in most places so you get to try something a little out of the ordinary.  Good variety of wines, the service has always been on point when I've come and the food never disappoints.  The quality is much better than most Asian places on the Strip and is a much better value than anything comparable would be inside a hotel.  

People are serious about needing to get there early because it fills up quickly.  Not uncommon to have a few dozen people waiting outside before the doors open."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing. the wine list... well, i think i'm in love. the service was great too. 

we were visiting from seattle and a friend told us to try this place and i'm so happy we made it. it's worth the rip off of the strip if you a on vacation. EAT HERE. i love thai food and eat it a lot, but lotus offers more unique and northern thai food than i have ever seen in one palce. the food was off the charts- we had a deepfierd rice with pickled sausage and mint appitizer followed by a few recomendatinos from our server which included some of the best cooked duck i have ever had in spicy thai basil sauce. i'll also love this palce for the rest of my life because they have such an amazingly extensive and affordable wine list. i was finally able to try a very specfic bottle of german riesling that i have never been able to afford anywhere else. 

bottom line: I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE. come eat great this food, drink great wine... and make a damn reservation or your gonna be waiting to get it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai cuisine here in Vegas, this is the place to go. And they have an crazy wine list!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! Lives up to the name! 

Even better, don't have to worry about getting stabbed when you leave the restaurant. 

Recommendations - pad see ew, pad Thai, GARLIC PRAWNS, yellow curry"}
{"text":"Me and my friends went back there again because we have a great time there, but this time the food was not good at all.  So, we asked the waiter and he said they have change the chef.  I wanted to ask him if the owner has change as well, but that would be rude.  So, I wouldn't recommend this place because the food was terrible."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I tried the garlic Shrimp and the duck panang. Both dishes were fried to perfection and had wonderful balance in flavor. The portion sizes were a tad smaller than I expected but if you're looking for a Thai place in Vegas this is it!"}
{"text":"Terrible is not the word for service. We went there last night. The waitress showed us an attitude as if she is doing some favor by getting us food. The food was also so-so, not up to the mark. I am very disappointed with you Lotus of Siam. Had heard some great reviews here."}
{"text":"First thoughts: Vegas sometimes feels like the city of AYCE, so why not Thai food too?
 
The menu at Lotus of Siam is extensive with the menu split into regional cuisine. (Northern, Southern, etc.) My bf and I had decided early on that we would eat at the lunch buffet instead so we arrived at around 11:45 am and the restaurant was already pretty packed. Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm.
 
For $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables.
 
For me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! 

The service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled.
 
Bottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food. If I return, I will probably order off the menu next time to compare with the AYCE food."}
{"text":"This place boasts itself as being the absolute best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact, as you walk in, there are a number of awards, accolades and write ups about this place.

I came with a friend so we ordered three dishes to split between us, two entres and one appetizer.

To start with, we ordered the stuffed chicken wings. These were my least favorite out of what we ordered. They lacked seasoning in my opinion.

Next, we ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken and the beef Pad Thai. Both of these dishes were terrific. The Pad Thai came with thinner style noodles than I normall expect with Pad Thai, but still, very good!

I wasn't particularly crazy about the service, as we didn't have a clear cut server, they kept changing, so we weren't sure who to ask for what. Also, their prices are sort of high for Thai food, but maybe it's because I'm comparing it to LA?

Overall, not bad, I'd actually go again, but who knows, with so many incredible dining options in Vegas, it just may be a while before I do.

Food: 3.5
Ambience: 2.5
Service: 3
Value: 3"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh, authentic food... wish I'd thought to ask for more guidance before ordering... It would be great to go with a big group in order to be able to sample more..."}
{"text":"3rd time here. We would have given it 5 stars but our reservation this time was at opening 5:30 and the Garlic Shrimp was not up to par as previous experiences .They were cold, harder and not as fresh. Seems like it was 2 hours pre-cooked since it's a popular dish and want to get ahead. But since it's that expensive & one of their best dish, it should be fresh all the time and clients wouldn't mind to wait. The rest of our ordered dishes were good as always."}
{"text":"Takeout was sub par. Thin watery curry, raw potatoes, really small portions and all meat in three dishes very dry. Not ok."}
{"text":"Finally a new location! I've gone to their original location twice and loved their food, but didn't enjoy the location much. Now I can get some Lotus of Siam more often since this location is pretty convenient for me! 

Since it's pretty close to my work, I came here during lunch hour with a coworker. My first impression was their decor, looked really fancy! It was busy since it was around 12:30pm lunch rush but got seated pretty quickly. I was opting for \"healthy\" option so I got the Thai beef salad. It was probably the best Thai beef salads I've ever had! They don't skimp out on the meat at all! 

I can't wait to come back for more delicious, authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Why are you closed on Sat afternoon, oh Lotus of Siam! I went to Vegas this past weekend with the high hopes of feasting at this place - only to be sadly disappointed that they only open for Dinner on the weekends. Reminder - always call ahead! 

About 8 years ago I once drove from San Diego to LV all by myself because I was craving their coconut sticky rice - a lil' crazy, i know, but worth every mile."}
{"text":"good food great service! they have a new location more upscale. Order from the chef choices"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars.  This is the worst place in Vegas. I don't know how much they have to pay Food Network to show them on TV, but you couldn't pay me to eat here again.  Why? When I go into a Thai restaurant and order in Thai, I expect authentic food prepared with authentic ingredients.  I do not expect jalapeños in my somtum, and I do not expect the owner to try to convince me that a jalapeño is a Thai pepper. No-go."}
{"text":"Spring rolls were delish! The dishes are simple but pack powerful flavor and portions are just right."}
{"text":"My Pad Se Ew was exceptional. All of the flavors were right on and our waiter was attentive. We will definitely be visiting again to explore the menu some more. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The garlic prawns are amazing. Enjoyed the snapper special too. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was good but sorta pricey for what we got. Four of us spent about 100 after tax/tip for lunch. Not the best thai food I've ever had but probably the best bang for your buck in Vegas. Especially if you go for their buffet from what I hear. 

If you really want thai food then go here, but I doubt I'll come here again. Next time I'm in vegas I'll hold off the thai food cravings until I'm back in Cali."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is absolutely one of my favorite buffets that I've been to. Located in the heart of buffet capital of the US (i.e. Vegas), Lotus of Siam is definitely one that you should stop by to check out.

Recommendation: The beef noodle soup is the most bomb soup I've had ever. So flavorful - especially with the different herbs, including cilantro. The beef is also extremely tender and delicious, and the noodles - thick rice noodles - go so well with the beef. I had about 3 bowls...soooo good.

The Pad Thai was also very good. The greasiness was not overwhelming like a lot of pad thai could be. The spicy-ness level was perfect - I always hate it when they assume that people can't take spicy-ness and make it mild and boring. The noodles were also nice and chewy, just like how I love my pad thai. 

The red curry chicken is also pretty delicious, as well as the fried bananas. The rest of the offerings were good but not great, but make sure you eat the the beef noodle soup, pad thai and red curry chicken.

The price is also extremely reasonable - only $11 for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I have ever eaten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am a fan of Top Chef and a couple of weeks ago the show visited Lotus.  My bf and I had a Vegas trip planned, so I thought - why not try it?? I will now be ruined for any future Thai restaurants - that's how good this place is.   

The restaurant is a hole in the wall, no ambiance but the servers are friendly and attentive... Here's what we ordered:

Tom Yum with Prawns (med spice) - the spice level was perfect, continued to build after each bite (or slurp).

Tod Muh Plar - fish cakes with cucumber salad, I would actually order the cucmber salad alone (its fabulous).

Kang Omon - catfish in a curry sauce, not as liquidy as a normal curry but delicious

Northern Thai - Khao Soi - noodles and beef (great - I had never tried N Thai food before)

Fried banana with honey and coconut ice cream for dessert - I could eat it everyday!

The food was great, the best Thai I have ever eaten, servers were friendly... I will go back everytime I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"What's left to be said that hasn't been said?  If you find yourself in Las Vegas and enjoy Thai food, you go to Lotus of Siam.  The staff is super courteous, professional and polite.  The food is exceptional.  It is never heavy on the stomach, fair portions with reasonable prices.  The food tastes both fresh and refreshing.  Not over the top spice like some Thai places, but they don't need to be.  The food, the staff, they stand on their own without the need for gimmicks."}
{"text":"My super sweet fiance made reservations week in advance for this place, and I'm such a lucky girl that he did - it was my favorite dining experience during this trip to Vegas! No wonder this place is considered the top Thai restaurant in the country - it's AMAZING!
Our server recommended \"Nam Kao Tod\" for our appetizer, which was very light, crispy and spicy. They actually asked us how spicy we wanted our food and it was just perfect every time. 
We had the chili fried rice with crab - OMG, this is the best fried rice I have EVER had in my life. It was absolutely perfect: Not too oily and perfectly seasoned. It was light on the crab but other than that, it was amazing. 
We had the crispy duck drunken noodles. I dont really like noodle dishes so I did not try the noodles, but the duck was soooo good. We ate every last bite of this dish between the two of us...it was simply amazing. 
We overstuffed ourselves, so we had no room for dessert. I would definitely recommend the thai iced tea. It's pretty hard to go wrong with that, but it definitely went well with our food. 
I'm super excited for our next trip to Vegas - just to go back here again!"}
{"text":"This was the best Thai Cuisine experience I have had outside of Bangkok!  Service was exceptionally attentive and the food, every dish, absolutely BRILLIANT!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded all my expectations! The food was amazing! We were told to order northern dishes and could not be more satisfied.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and taste their food again. 
The servers were extremely friendly and helpful. If you don't have reservations, make sure to arrive early."}
{"text":"Hmmm a bit pricey but totally worth it. The place was packed did not expect the place to be that great. The Garlic shrimp was really tasty deep fried topped with garlic sauce I think it  was fried at a high temp the prawns  became cracklings you can eat the whole shrimp. Combination fried rice was different from Archi's a bit more salty not so sweet. 

The northern Dish we tried however which is the eggplant with minced pork had a totally different flavor profile from the other thai resto's we tried locally in Vegas.  The dessert with mango and sticky rice had a unique flavor coconut milk with a tinge of chamomile or lavender were still discussing what they added which was a total surprise. 

The whole Dining experience was really good. We will definitely come back for the other northern dishes and Chefs special on special occasion which is coming soon. For Vegas PEEPS as well as Visitors out of the country and out of STATE definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian Jain food.

This is probably the best thai food I have eaten.

The service is superb. The person who took the order was very patient as we had too many questions and requests ( not to put onion, garlic, fish sauce, oyster sauce, eggs) and he was so helpful. The other person who served us with water and drinks was also very courteous.

We ordered the following items:
Panang Curry (regular with onion and garlic)
Drunken Noodles (veggie- Jain)
Thai Fried Rice(veggie - Jain)
Fried Tofu

The lemon-lime drink and the iced-tea were also good.

They gave a decent quantity of rice with the food too and we did not need to ask for any more rice (some places they give you small bowls of rice and then you end up ordering extra rice bowls)

Would definitely visit it again when I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 and we waited around 20 mins which wasn't bad. I've wanted to try Lotus of Siam for a long time and it didn't fail me in anyway. We shared an appetizer of veggies with chili paste, seabass with drunken noodles, and Crispy duck with panang curry(coconut curry). 

The veggies with chili paste was surprisingly good. The chili gave the veggies a lot of taste to it. the seabass was fried and we decided to combine it w/ the drunken noodles. I thought the seabass was very good as it was seasoned well, cooked perfectly, while the fish is not dry at all and the crispy skin made it awesome. However, I was probably the only one but I thought the noodles was a bit endante? kinda hard ? I felt like it wasn't soft enough or cook long enough for some reason and that threw me off just a little. It wasn't too big of an issue but it was my little thing that I had to criticize about it. Finally we have the crispy duck w/ panang curry. YOU have to make sure you get steam rice w/ this(order separately)  or else you're not doing this dish justice. Have some rice, put the sauce on top, grab a crispy duck(which they cut for you) and my god it is wonderful. I never had \"crispy duck\" before but it was awesome. 

Took out a star because I thought the dishes were kinda luke warm which is a bit disappointing and I also think it's overpriced especially for how much they give you(which isn't that much imo). I would definitely still recommend you guys to try Lotus of Siam because these unique dishes are wonderful and if you had to choose one dish to get here...make sure you get the crispy duck with panang curry!"}
{"text":"Actually would give it 2.5 stars. Food is ok but I liked the place, very large 2 dining rooms and don't feel like the traditional Thai restaurant. Had chicken basil thai style thai hot and it was hot! Small portion and flavor was ok. Had wontons which were also ok. Liked being off strip and need to find more local finds."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant many years ago by a friend.  I was a new Las Vegas resident who didn't quite know her way around all that well yet, but this place has DEFINITELY stayed on my radar.   The price points are perfect, the food to die for; whether it's something simple and comfort-food to you, or something new and exciting.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"lotus of siam has the best thai food in las vegas! been going there since it opened, and SAIPAN CHUTIMA and her family rocks the boat!!she has  been the top thai chef in las  vegas for years, and never fails to amaze with her delicious dishes. the wine list, especially the whites is superb.everything on the menu is top quality, and authentic tasting!!! thanks siapan and girls for a wonderful dining experience!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT customer service.  Their spicy IS spicier than the usual so one of the head waiters Mr. TARN \"saw\"my pain while trying to enjoy our soup and he took it back to \"even it out\"...what a delight. Their food is delicious...definitely coming back. Thanks to my dentist for recommending"}
{"text":"We were getting a bit desperate finding a place in their area that was open for lunch - at least beyond the soulless fast food options in the area. Finally lucked out here. Great food and the service was spot on, even though they were just about to close their lunch service. I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Overdue review.

Heard a lot of great reviews!  We've went for a special occasion, 'da 'ohana'!  And i am sad to say, i didn't take pictures of everything we had.  BUT 'da 'ohana' and I, we all enjoyed it!  Will definitely return and tell others, they gotta go!

MUST MAKE RESERVATION and we went early!  

Service - exceptional from calling for reservation, greeting, table service to exiting.
Food - everything we had was small portions, but there were all worth it!  Hope they will build that up when we come back.  
-fried rice;
-chow fun;
-beef broccoli;
-won ton soup;
-beef rib eye;
-clams;
-prawns;
-pork belly;
-a lot more
Drinks - tea, water, soda and we also ordered Wine.  Just prepare, they have a huge 3 inch binder of Wine/Champagne to order from.

Good thing we were on the way out after being there for over 1.5 hour.  Kenny Lee/Lees Liquor and his party started to show up for the back area and the bar area was starting to get jammed packed with people from the convention.

Plan accordingly.

Quiet at first, when we arrived, because they just opened.  Noisy when we were leaving."}
{"text":"Just above average. Certainly not worth the hype. I would maybe have given it one more star if it wasn't for the wait. I don't mind waiting for an exceptional restaurant, but slightly above average in quality and price makes it an overall loser in my book. My standards are high for Thai restaurants. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I would definitely not have gone to five stars even if there was no line."}
{"text":"I loved this place. There was a 45 minute wait, but well worth it. I ate the pork stew off the northern menu. It was delicious. The place was busy, clean and the staff were very attentive. No surprise some of my favorite food network chefs had their pictures on the wall. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about the location of this restaurant, but don't let that fool you, the food is phenomenal. This is probably one of the most popular restaurants in all of Vegas and I can't believe I waited this long to leave a review! 

I've been here twice. The most recent visit, I came here with a bunch of friends with a reseravation and ordered lots of food to try! Everything was beyond my standard for Thai food. I especially liked the roasted duck curry, pad see ew, crispy duck and garlic prawns. 

Service was great and it seemed like there was a long wait for those without a reservation. So I would highly recommend making a reservation before coming."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in Las Vegas by far. Be prepared to wait because this place does get busy. It's for alot of locals but if you know places to go in Vegas it's a must stop. If you order the papaya salad make sure to scale how spicy you want it made because it can't get off the charts. Order the garlic prawn, its semi deshelled but the shell is fried crispy enough to eat. It's my favorite dish and so far the best shrimp I have ever had. I been trying to find places in Houston that carries this but so far haven't found on yet. I'm definetly a fan for life. Must try this place if visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. I went for my birthday and ordered many dishes. All of which were mediocre at best. One of the dishes was Tom yum soup. The server dropped the entire cup of soup on the table, my phone, my lap and down my leg. To make matters worse I wore white shorts. He proceeded to apologize and brought me napkins to clean the mess myself. They also brought an additional cup to replace the cup they dumped on me. No other sort of accommodation was offered. We asked at bill time to at least have the soup removed and they told us they gave us a free cup to make amends and seemed perplexed that we had issues. Bottom line: the food is no where near worth the wait. The service was sub par, and my white shorts are ruined! Happy birthday to me! If you're debating between this place and Arawan (Thai restaurant in same parking lot) definitely go to Arawan where the service is great and the food is better!"}
{"text":"Do not allow the location to fool you, Amazing food, we tried an assortment of plates and it was BY FAR some of the best Thai food I've had. Their curry chicken is simply AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try Thai tonight.  So, off on Yelp we went and we found the reviews on Lotus of Siam.  Based on what we read, it sounded great and we went to check it out.

First off, it was quite a hike from where we live to the restaurant (45 minutes).  It is not located in a very pristine area.  In fact, questionable would be a nice word.  The only good part of the location is that it is in an outside shopping mall.  As a result, there were plenty of parking.  When we arrived, there were not a lot of cars there.

We made reservations for Friday @ 5:30pm (opening time).  By the way, MAKE reservations.  Otherwise, good luck on getting a table.  When we got there, there already was a line about 15-20 people deep.  That is a great sign.  Somehow, people waiting outside kinda reminds me of the Disney flick/cartoon -- Ratatouie (you know at the end of the movie where the crowd is waiting to get in).  By the way, if you do not have reservations, depending on how busy they are, you may be turned down.  They turned a few people away due to \"no availability\".

Because of the early dinner and the reservation, we had no problems getting a table and were seated within a few minutes.  Walking into the restaurant, you notice immediately how clean and big the restaurant is.  The staff were very courteous and friendly.  I was definitely impressed.  

Now, on to the food, the 3 of us ordered a variety of items and shared amongst us.  By the way, there was a table of 8 family members next to us, they all ordered their own dish and did not share.  I can not imagine us doing this.  I would be tempted to taste and try every possible dish that I can.  Anyways, this is what we ordered: 

Appetizers:
a.  Tom Yum Coconut Soup w/ Chicken.  Compared to a lot of Thai restaurants that I have been, this was on the scale of AVERAGE.  It was okay and nothing to brag about.  Would I order this again... probably not -- I would preferred to try something else.  It was good average... I give this a mid to low 3 stars.

b.  #14 - Nam Kao -- okay, we ordered this because of the reviews.  It is basically sliced ginger, mixed with some fried type of crouton/rice/bread (hard to pinpoint), green onions, red onions, papayas, and some other stuff.  I guess this is sort of a hit or miss.  You either like it or not.  Honestly, I was not a fan.  In fact, I thought this was the worst dish of the night.  I give this a mid 2 stars.

c.  Beef salad -- this was the star of our dinner.  By far and away the best dish of the night.  If I knew, I would have ordered 2-3 of these puppies.  The beef was cooked to perfection ~ medium rare.  And, it was seasoned to perfection.  The only issue that I had was that it was very spicy (for a #2 spice level).  I must have drained 3 large glasses of water.  But, this was well worth it.  My first 5 stars.

Entrees:
a.  Drunken Sea Bass w/ Noodles -- okay, this dish was about 29.95.  It was a bit pricey; however, based on the review, we had to try it.  And, quite frankly, this was a very good dish.  The Sea Bass was soft, tender, and flaky.  And, the right mixture of sweetness and season was mixed in with the noodles. But, I did not think this should have been a $29.95 dish.  It is a bit steep.  For this, I grade it as a low 4-4.25 stars.

b.  Fried Prawns -- this was by far the most original dish.  They basically take these jumbo sized shrimp (think size 10-15) and peel the skin back.  Best way to explain this is to think of a horizontal line.  On one end of the shrimp is the shrimp meat and on the other is the peeled shell side.  They marinate the whole shebang in some salty sauce and deep fry it.  What you get is a fried shrimp with the shell attached.  You eat both the meat and the shell.  It was quite tasty.  However, I have to say that I wished they had a dip for this - something tangy would be a nice fit .. i.e. sweet and sour would do.  For originality and taste, I give them a high 4 stars or low 5 stars.

Desserts:
a.  Fried Banana -  If I had to do it again, I would not order this.  It was okay.... also, we were a bit too full to eat this -- doggy bag time.  2-3 stars.\

b.  Sweet Rice with Mangos -- this was not too original.  I was not into the rice; however, I have to admit that the mangos were very sweet.  I give this a mid 3-star rating for the mangos.

Overall, this was a pretty cool experience.  The service was excellent.  We had some dishes that were okay, but we also had some amazing and original dishes as well.  Dinner total for 3 (no drinks - except water) totaled to 106 dollars.  With tip, it added up to $125 in all.  3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts -- hmm, not a bad price at all!  I would give this a solid 4 with room to move up to 5 star status...

BTW, as we walked out around 7pm, the whole restaurant was packed and the parking lot was filled with Lotus of Siam patrons.

We definitely would be back.  And, we look forward to trying other dishes.

Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Heard a couple in the hotel elevator talking about their plans to go here for dinner (5 years ago?) and since then, no trip to Vegas is complete without a meal at Lotus! 

Dinner starts at 5:30 so we always try to come here a little earlier to beat the crowd and even then there's a line. Tonight got here at 5:30 and the wait was an hour. 

TIPS:
- Come at 5 to get in line so when they open at 530 you're first
- Or call for a reservation but their phone is always busy so try calling 1-2 days in advance. Also if you're not here within 5 mins of your reservation, you lose your spot

WHAT WE ORDERED TONIGHT: 
1. Crispy duck panang - THIS IS A MUST TRY. Every time we're here. We usually get this spicy since I think it enhances the flavor. This time we got medium and while still good, spicy would've tasted better. The sauce is AMAZINGG I don't waste a drop of it so once the duck is all gone I put some rice in the dish and mix it with the sauce and yummmm *___*
2. Tom yum soup- was not so yum. Not sure why but the last two times I've been here (tonight included) I wasn't very impressed with the soup. It tasted pretty bland and lacking in flavor. I've had better. This is why 4 stars 
3. Sea bass with drunken noodles - first time trying this and will definitely order this again the next time! 
4. Lamb (the waiter suggested this as it was the special) I personally am not a big fan of lamb so can't really give my opinion on whether or not it was good
And then the defaults:
5. Pad Thai - 4/5 
6. Pad See Ew - my nephew hogged it all before I could get a taste but I didn't hear any complaints and he's very picky with his pad see ew!

The portions are not as big as other Thai restaurants I usually go to so if you're planning to share at the table, keep that in mind! We usually order as many dishes as there are people in our party and keep a menu on the side in case we're still hungry.

Service is great and the waiters are very nice!"}
{"text":"Garlic prawns is a must. Got the drunken noodle with soft shelled crab, short rib panang curry, crispy rice appetizer, and northern larb. All good, but standout was the garlic prawns"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I just got off a plane and was starving and my friends had been rock climbing all day and probably would have thought a Slim Jim was the best thing they ever tasted.

When you arrive, you will think you are in the wrong place.  It's in a crazy seedy strip mall and at night I had trouble picking this restaurant out of the string of strange establishments.  It was so dark that I thought they were closed (none of the strip mall's neon lights were on), but then I saw an open sign.

Inside it is nicer.  Huge wine selection.  On the menu there is an entree specialty section priced in the +$20 range, but the standard menu has lots of options under $10.  My 3 friends and I got 4 entrees and two beers for under $50.

I may get crap for it, but I always order pad thai as a backup when at a new thai restaurant because it's usually edible, even if the other stuff you order is not.  Everything we ordered (cashew nut chicken, lemon pepper pork, yellow curry, pad thai) was great, but I was surprised that the pad thai was phenomenal. 

The guys in the group were scraping every last peppercorn off the dish.  I had to practically stop them from licking the plates!

Even if we were biased by hunger, I have had marginal thai food before.  This place was fantastic and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Once again - surprised at the quality of Asian choices once you get off The Strip.  This time Thai and Southeast Asian.  

But first - do not be alarmed when you actually find the place.  In a very shabby strip mall well off The Strip - a few crappy stores and eateries, a few boarded up places, a smattering of panhandlers and transients (trying real hard to be politically correct).  Look past all this and go in the front door - and prepare to be pleasantly amazed.

Very large restaurant - crowded, hell of a wine cellar (in a Thai place - must be a Vegas thing).  Bit of a wait but not intolerable.  Polite and knowledgeable staff - and willing to take the time to explain the enormous menus and really help with your selection.

Started off with deep fried tofu and beef larb - off to a very good start.  A variety of main courses - and just a ridiculous amount of offerings to choose from.  Finally settled on the Rad Na, Nua Nam Tok and Koi Soi - all prepared well, plenty to eat and enough to share.  A good sampling for future visits.  Strong but not too strong Thai Ice Tea to wash it all down.

Just remember - suck it up and make your way inside.  Well worth it"}
{"text":"Scuzzy outside , creepy parking lot, 40 minute wait. A tiny price to pay to get to eat here! OMG. I could eat here everyday! Here's a tip. Make sure to lock your car , and make reservations !!

Must try; all the soups . Stuffed chicken wings and something you can't pronounce!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food and such great flavors. I went for dinner since there were some negative reviews for their lunch buffet and I am not disappointed. We ordered the garlic prawns, a south Thai beef noodle dish and Chilean sea bass flat noodles. Even though we weren't hungry from our other food destinations, we demolished everything. I wished I had ordered the garlic prawns just for myself because it was unsightly of me to stab others in the hand with my fork as we fought for the last piece. The shrimp is fried so well and smart. By that I mean that they actually separate the meat from the shell so that the shell comes out like shrimp chips. One of the reasons I will be coming back to Vegas is so that I can come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and it does not disappoint. I came once for dinner and once for lunch. Other than the bums out in the parking lot asking for money, this place is spot on when it comes to Thai food. 

I have tried their pad thai, panang curry with chicken and this amazing seafood dish with assorted seafood, veggies and this to die for sauce. Everything was really good, flavorful and came out pipping hot. 

This place is super busy all the time. I did come for lunch on a Tuesday, and the gentleman sitting next to me told me I had to try the soup of the day as it is only served on Tuesdays and he said he has been coming back every Tuesday for over 10 years. Next time I am trying the soup he was suggesting."}
{"text":"Been here many times, great food, line is long, plan to come here from LA to celebrate my wife BD with 14 friends, called last week to make reservation for Saturday,  they will not accept reservation for Saturday night. We agreed for Sunday night instead, they required minimum,we agreed, they said will send us an email to fill out information require to deposit, been waiting and calling, as of today get no email from them.
We called another Thai Restaurant on the same street, beautifully set it up for us for Saturday and they also have a pastries chef to do a beautiful cake for my wife and this venue is so clean and beautiful.
If you happen to have the same situation look around and you will find this restaurant and try out ,you will love the place, the pastries, the food and the most important thing is their services.
Adios Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Bomb seafood soup and padsee yew. Green curry was okay, felt like I've had better. It was a bit blander I like it sweet. Chicken was great. Awesome service and the place is ALWAYS packed. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"It has become a tradition of my fiance and I, to comeand eat here every single time we are in Vegas. The service and food is phenomenal. It's not a \"cheap\" thai restaurant. It's actually a bit expensive but worth every penny. The ingredients and quality of food is superb. 

You can even see all the celebrities and well known figures coming to the restaurant and their picture with the owner is on the wall. Even top chefs from all over the world come here to eat! It's seriously THAT good! We always get the prawns and sausage.suer tasty! I am a bit boting and I also get the pad see ew and thai tea but its so yummy, I just can't help myself. But they are more known for Northern Thai cuisine so I highly recommend you select their specialties instead."}
{"text":"Its larger inside than it looks from the curb.  There's no signage from the street because all the storefronts face the interior parking lot.  My boyfriend asked for a quiet area so the waiter sat us in the corner of the larger dining room.  Drunken noodles with prawns is a larger dish than the seafood version but I was surprised that the shrimp was fried.  Even though we were told that there were only several of the shellfish, this dish lasted until lunch the next day.

I enjoyed the young jackfruit red curry with catfish from the Northern Thai menu.  I'd go back here.  I was glad we decided to keep our reservation instead of eating the evening reception at our hotel.  Mango isn't in season so we couldn't have it with sticky rice as dessert.  My Thai iced tea wasn't dyed orange.  

The Chang beer comes with a branded glass.  We ordered beef wontons as an appetizer but the sweet and sour sauce could have been spicier despite the jalapeno in the container.  We'd probably take co-workers here."}
{"text":"After hearing raves about this place from Food Network shows, I had to stop by during my Vegas visit. 

We ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. 

The Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.

The Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.

The Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. 

All in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).

The strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad."}
{"text":"been seeing this place pop up on yelp whenever i search for thai. man oh man over 3,500 at almost five stars! 

i want to say it is pretty good! but i wouldnt say it was the best i ever had and it does have some pricier dishes.   even thai tea and thai coffee were $5. i get for seafood but even the duck was around $28 as well. and on that note, go ahead and get the duck because it really was good.

in fact i just update this review because it is hard to find the fried duck curry elsewhere."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is good.  After having eaten mediocre room service food and hotel food for a day and a half, the girls and I decided to venture away from the strip and eat here for dinner.  Well worth it!  I would recommend getting the drunken crab noodles, which is a lot like Kee-mao (my fave Thai noodle dish) with soft shell crab, the penang curry with braised short ribs (to die for), and the mango sticky rice.  This was like a party in my mouth."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and can't say enough about their customer service and food. Like most have already said, do not judge the restaurant by it's exterior! Without a doubt, they are the best Thai restaurant in the business.  Must haves are their Garlic prawns + Northern Thai items."}
{"text":"Yum!  As I have stated in prior reviews, I am NOT a Thai food professional!  Don't get me wrong, I like Thai food more than I should and I have been on a kick the past few months, but I rarely varie from Pad Thai or Curry.  That said, I was EXTREMELY tempted to wonder off my path and attempt a new item or two (but didn't due to a long road trip home and I did NOT want to chance something not sitting right - if you know what I mean).  

They did screw our order up (wifes curry WAY too spicy for her and my Pad Thai not nearly spicy enough).  We just swapped plates and enjoyed each others meals (no complaints from me, I really like spicy curry).

The food is good, staff is helpful and friendly.  The restaurant is not the nicest I have been in (you can tell from the outside you will not be experiencing fine dinning) - but again, I am not really complaining.  The place is clean, just older.

My wife and I enjoyed looking at pictures of all the famous people who have enjoyed a meal or two here and even though the place was packed, we got a table quickly and our food came out fast.

Overall it was a great experience and next time I am in Vegas I will try something new at Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"One of the top Thai restaurants in the US and easily the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tucked away from the strip in a little mall- this is a hidden gem!

The food is all amazing! Delicious! And spice levels to your taste.

They specialize in Northern Thai- but anything on the menu if good."}
{"text":"Fast to serve, VERY attentive servers and delicious food.  Again, when in Vegas, do not forget to check out places OFF the strip. Go where the locals go.

If you like Thai food, this place is a must visit for you.   They have lunch and dinner seatings and it may be a line to get a table even! I think you can make a reservation, so that may be wise. 

I had their green curry and oh my - the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"The duck in curry sauce and garlic prawns are a should try. The curry sauce on the duck was one of the best I've tried. And the garlic prawns are very flavorful.

The portions are quite small, and prices are a high.

The service, awesome. Our waiter was a silly guy extremely friendly, funny, and professional."}
{"text":"Overpriced and just okay IMO.  My friends hyped up this place for me too much."}
{"text":"Recommended by my friend Dave from New York. We are both big foodies. Everything here I ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"Go for the buffet. It's worth it. Menu changes every day for the buffet. Friendly and nice service"}
{"text":"Who would've thought such a delicious, clean place would be located in what looks like a vacant strip mall.  Good food is really best enjoyed when coupled with excellent service...& the Lotus of Siam has an abundance of both.  The food was savory and a great value.  Good for a couples dinner or large party.  We had a party of 16 which they did a great job accommodating.  We will definitely be returning on our next trip out.  Kudos to Tony our server...thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is the first meal we had off-strip this visit and it was crazy good. Confession, I've somehow never had Thai food. I have no good excuse, I've just been a little intimidated and it hasn't happened. That changed today. Everything we had was over the top delicious and perfectly prepared. Try the Pad Thai and the first item on the Northern menu. Order them both, and more, and go family style. You cannot go wrong here, just call ahead, the word is obviously out."}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai cuisine! The menu is expansive, but all good. Enjoyed some new food, and excited to come back."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town.  A must for brining visitors."}
{"text":"Ahh, dinner at this legendary spot.  What more is there to say that hasn't already been documented about LOS?  I had the sea bass with drunken noodles.  Just a beautiful dish, looks and taste.  Stuffed fried chicken and crunchy rice for appetizers, both were absolutely delicious.  The place is peppered with celebrity photos of those who have dined there previously.  Surprisingly decent beer list for a Thai joint along with their notorious wine selection.  I will return for sure the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! You would never know how great this place is based on it's outward appearance and location but the inside is upscale, elegant and the some of the best thai food in the city!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food. I had the sliced and fried catfish. They used a bunch of fresh herbs and it came with green mini eggplants and peppers. So good. I ordered spice level 8 (They go from 1-10) and I started sweating. 
I'll be back next time when I'm in Vegas. Forget all those overpriced hotel restaurants - this is the place to go. 
And I might want to mention that they have an award winning wine cellar (Wine Spectator) - not bad for a restaurant where you can get a dinner for 9 bucks."}
{"text":"Came here bc of all the raves about this place... I've had better! The seasoning here do need help. I tried the tom yum soup with catfish hot pot and the coloring wasn't as appealing. The papaya salad (Lao's style) was a bit salty. Nothing really hit the spot.... not worth the drive and visit."}
{"text":"Thai Iced Tea - PERFECT. Nam Tok salad - NOT SO PERFECT. Pad See Eew - NOT COOKED WELL. NOT HOT. Service - EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Seems very popular but it seemed no better than my usual Archie's Thai restaurant. Very long lines for typical Thai food. Their beef and sticky rice seemed too burnt for me... Although that is the typical way of making it. I requested it to be less burnt but it was still served very burnt anyway."}
{"text":"We always make a trip to Lotus when we are in town! And I am a boring reviewer when we come here because we always enjoy (basically) the same dishes!  Because they are that good!! Tonight we shared the sea bass over drunken noodles oh and we ordered 2 orders... that is a CLUE!!! (one order heat temp of 5 and the other heat of 6) and I can say 6 is enough for my heat meter. And I love spicy!!! But this is a slow burn type of heat... then we shared a shrimp fried rice (which I would skip because you can have this at any restaurant in any city Usa... there was nothing special about this dish) then we shared the garlic prawns which are delicious and don't shy away from the fried heads they are delicious. And the garlic prawns are not greasy and fried tasting then finally I had the crispy catfish pieces salad. I loved the dressing on his salad as it is lime and citrus and light as air.  Tonight thought the catfish was not my favorite. It was a little fishy. But all in all such a great dinner!! A MUST stop!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nothing from the outside but once inside it's nice. The 45 min wait time for a Wednesday night was intriguing, this usually means it's gonna be good right? The wait staff were very pleasant and the service was quick. I ordered 3 staples - Chicken Satay, Fish cakes and Panang Chicken. I'd give them a 7 out of 10 for food. I've definitely had better even in my little local in Scottsdale. Not being familiar with their Northern dishes I didn't want to be too adventurous so went with what I knew. I'd come here again to try some more adventurous dishes but for now not wowed which is disappointing as I'd waited so long to try it."}
{"text":"A far travel to go eat for Thai food. The interior looked really nice and had authentic decorations. At first the place seems small but has a lot of space. We were seated quickly as well.

SERVICE
Friendly and prompt. Waiters and waitresses checked on us regularly.

FOOD
I enjoyed the fish cake, but it was a little on the saltier side for me. The chili sauce it comes with paired well. The garlic prawns were good and crispy (nice texture), I think they're known for their shrimps mostly. The papaya salad (my favorite Thai dish) was disappointing. The flavor was not what I was used to and there was so much sauce which made it liquidly. The coconut tom yum with chicken was good. You can really taste the coconut milk but the soup was too sour (probably from the lime).

CONCLUSION
Good ambience, but I will come again to give this place another shot for their food."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 
I would absolutely recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas! I'd go back just for the crispy duck curry. We really enjoyed the nam kao tod, and the garlic prawns and pad se-ew were pretty good.

Service: 5/5
The service was fantastic, from our warm welcome through the end of the meal. I wasn't sure if we could eat the deep fried prawn shells, and one of the waiters returned immediately to let us know we could (they're delicious!).

Ambience: 4.5/5
The restaurant space is really special, and we felt very comfortable and at home. Even though it was full when we went we never felt crowded or unattended to.

Value 4.5/5 
The prices run a bit high compared to our usual Thai food eateries, but as mentioned I would go back just for the crispy duck curry! It's such a special experience and the best Thai food I've had :-) 

4.75 - In short...crispy duck curry!!!"}
{"text":"Such an unassuming location, but very delicious food!

Our favorites were the tom kha gai soup and the various noodle dishes we tried. The mango sticky rice was an added bonus!

The service was great and we were seated immediately (with a reservation)."}
{"text":"It was okay, I ordered the Rad Na and my husband had the pad se eww. Both were okay, nothing compared to the food in Westminster, Ca. I found it to be missing some flavors and was very disappointed. From the reviews, I expected a lot. I wouldn't recommend this place to others, especially if it was their first time trying out Thai food. If you can't even get the main traditional dishes right, I cant even imagine the others."}
{"text":"Finally visited this new space for Lotus of Siam. Roof collapse ... or not ... it was a smart business move on the owner's part to use it as a vehicle/excuse to port his reputation into better digs. 

This location is readily accessible, just east of mid-Strip, to the mass of tourists who are following the leads falling from The Travel Channel, Zagat, et. al. ... and it shows in the wait time. No reservation (7pm on a Monday night) so we ended up being seated at a couch & coffee table in the waiting area. And we were lucky to get that. Within 15 minutes, there was a crowed of over 50 lingering all around and over top of us, praying for a seating sometime soon. And when I left to powder my nose after my meal, they were already seating others in my couch ... even though I hadn't actually quite given up my own seating just yet. 

The space has also morphed into entirely upscale and inviting toward the aforementioned tourists. Gorgeous.

U-Hauling its monikers of \"Best Thai in Vegas\" and \"Top Thai in America\" to this new location has also unloaded price increases to match. They, also, are a far cry from what I remember of my visits to the original Sahara Commercial Center space ... a sort of seedy location and minimal décor that only added to the mystique & satisfaction of one's \"discovery\" of the joint. Again, this new location has gone pro, polished up nicely for tourist consumption. 

Any kind of soup, salad or appetizer is at least a ten buck set-back. The basic entrees -- pad thai, drunken noodles - are priced moderately, but you'll have to plow through a lengthy menu packed with trendy & pricey cuisine in order to find them. I made out quite well with seafood drunken noodles at $14. The seafood portion was generous, given that price. However, the six teeny-weenie appetite-whetting dumplings at $9, well that's another matter. Point being, your meal here will not be anywhere near as inexpensive as your typical sling-Thai-kitchen-joint, unless you diligently shop the menu.

Quality of product is quite high, no issues there. I mean, how could you James Beard-Zagat-Food Network the place otherwise? 

RECOMMENDATION: Without a reservation, you'll likely wait hours, so make one. It's Thai, durn good Thai, but it's gonna set you back. So this venue is best used to impress your lady friend. Otherwise, sadly, better to just punt it to the tourists ... and lament the bygone era of AYCE lunch-buffet back at the Commercial Center."}
{"text":"Really really good! Lard na ck was too watery, ck satay was good, green curry was not thick enough, larb salad was great, soup was ok, nam kao was great, crispy duck curry was the best!! Garlic prawn great, crab fried rice great, hoise fried rice was meh, seabass was ok. Nice!!!"}
{"text":"Every good thing you've heard and read about LOS is true.

I am back from my latest jaunt to Viva and finally had a chance to dine at LOS.  We went during lunch.  At first I wanted to try the buffet, but thought better of trying the authentic Thai that I've always wanted to try.  Besides, the buffet had limited traditional dishes that I could get at Panda Express.

No, I wanted the real deal.  And I got it.  To start, we had the Beef Satay.  The peanut sauce was awesome, a bit spicy and flavorful.  The cucumber salad was crunchy and fresh.  Then the spicy chicken wings.  Why?  Why can I never make these at home?  The sweet-spicy garlic chile sauce was great and the wing itself was crunchy and hot.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I could have made a meal from that alone.

On to the entrees:

MEE KROB RAD NA-Crispy egg noodle topped with straw
mushroom, vegetable and gravy. I had it with chicken and it was so good.  even when I pushed it aside, I was still eating from the bowl.

MOO YANG-Marinated charbroiled pork, served with spicy sauce.  Without the spicy sauce, it was a star.  With the sauce, it rang out with high notes.

The service was attentive and warm.  I absolutely enjoyed the experience and will return.  Don't let the area deter you from this gem."}
{"text":"Finally I got to try this place!!! Yay!!!

Thanks to Amy K's suggestion, we ordered the drunken noodle soft crab and the northern red curry. We also ordered this beef dish...can't remember the name...and we also ordered catfish. And last but certainly not least, the mango sticky rice:

drunken noodle soft crab: Very good. Definitely a must try.

northern red curry: Yes, not much of a curry, more like a stew. Also not as sweet as panang..I think they use less coconut milk. So if you like coconut milk, you may not like this version of curry as much. 

beef dish: it was a cold dish...cubed filet mignon..anyway, we thought it would be warm so it was a little surprising..it tasted like the beef on the beef salad...good but nothing extraordinary.

catfish: breaded and sauced...pretty good...loved it! put the sauce on our rice and ate it up! You must try it!!

mango sticky rice: I looooooved this version...the rice was more complex in flavors than the others I've tasted...maybe I'm crazy...even  the mango pieces were perfectly ripe and was sweeter than normal, too...but it was really good...my friend who doesn't even like sweets, loved it, too...i could come back just for this...hopefully i'm not building it up too much...haha 

Wish they were local..."}
{"text":"I really just don't get why my friends seem to fall all over themselves when it comes to this place, but I am talked into going just about every time I'm in Vegas.  Maybe I'm spoiled by all the great Thai food in Chicago?  I don't know.

Every time we come here, there is a huge wait and we end up waiting 45 minutes for a table.  Once we are seated, the service is usually pretty slow and inconsistent.  The servers are always friendly enough, but considering that we are usually about to eat our arms off after the wait, we're looking to get just about anything on our table.  OK, maybe we're not the best judges of pace.

This is a beer and wine place, and this time I chose the beer option.  I was impressed by their selection of beers from around the globe.  Guinness at a Thai place?  OK!  In fact I probably would have ordered another.  Where was that server again?

The food here is always just ok for me.  This time I went with the Musaman curry.  I asked for it \"spicy, not spicy like people who think they eat spicy, spicy like actually spicy.\"  They made it just perfect.  It was delightfully spicy, but not run around the room spicy.  Yummy.

This place is relatively inexpensive, but not cheap, especially considering the $20 cab ride from the strip."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I've come here twice now and enjoyed everything I ate both times. I would definitely try to make a reservation or come during off hours because during those busy dinner hours (haven't tried going during lunch yet) this place gets PACKED and you'll have to wait a while. 

Basically, you should go ahead and try everything on the menu. I've had a lot of different dishes and they were all delicious. I would trust this place to make everything taste good, it's THAT good. 

One thing to beware, however, is if you can't eat spicy foods or you don't like pungent foods. Thai food generally has strong flavors because they use lots of herbs and spices and fish sauce pretty liberally. This place takes that to the next level. The flavors are very strong. Also, if you can't eat spicy foods, be careful here. I love spicy foods and prefer my food to be very very spicy (basically, the more it burns/hurts the better it tastes lol) and when we came here, even though we didn't ever specify spicy level, most of the foods came out pretty spicy. Their papaya salad was surprisingly very spicy. So just be careful. If you can't eat spicy, make sure to tell them that."}
{"text":"\"Big things poppin' and little things stoppin\" - TI

This place is wonderful.  Thank you anthony bourdain and jet tila for introducing this place to the world.  It is off the strip so a bit harder to get to but the food is poppin with flavor.   

*****papaya salad - AAammazing spicy but amazing best i ever had
**** garlic prawns - poppin with flavor
** soft shell drunken noodle - it was ok

Stick with the dishes at the back of the menu"}
{"text":"Aaaamazing Food! Great Wine Selection.
Get the Deep Fried Catfish and a bottle or two of NxNW red. :)
Such a great night!"}
{"text":"TONY was an amazing server!! He was super attentive and polite!!! 

Had the sea food soup ( be careful lots of flavor but is super spicy) it was so fresh!! Pad see ew was smokey and very flavorful! But by far that coconut ice cream on sticky rice is a MOST TRY !! 

Easy parking 
Line wasn't long at all 
Fast service on food and drinks"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I should give this place a solid 5 stars, based on the fact that it was 110 degrees outside and we waited FOREVER for drinks when that seemed like the one time I REALLY needed water.

I have Thai family, and they make me all sorts of awesome Thai food. I was so excited to finally eat here.

It was the most amazing food ever.

It sounds very basic and expected, but the Wor Wonton Soup was my favorite. It was perfect. I didn't touch it for a while because the steam coming off of the top was like a warning sign. The broth, the dumplings, the chicken - absolute perfection.

Prawn in a blanket - a must have when eating here.

The Pad Thai was like gourmet Pad Thai. Not the traditional flat linguini-like noodles I'm used to. Everything was perfect. A good amount of egg, which is always a plus.

I didn't have enough room for dessert, but they all sounded wonderful.

It's in a weird area, but don't let that deter you from stepping inside. Once you do, you get to see all of their patrons. The walls are covered in articles, awards, history.

I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Simply put, they live up to the hype, and deserve the accolades.

The famous garlic prawns definitely left a favorable, long standing impression on their food, so much so that even though we have to pay $15 for delivery, we order their food through the Postmates iPhone app.

Combination fired rice, yum woon sen were also great. We want to explore other items in the future, but the garlic prawns will always be a roadblock for our small-ish appetite. But I can't complain when something is too good to skip."}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally get reservations to eat here. Heard great things about it. So disappointed by everything we ordered. I couldn't Even finish the food. Stopped at a fast food joint after to get filled up. I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.
Tom kha chicken was gross. Horrible flavor, chicken smelled bad. 
Satay Chicken didn't have much flavor, peanut sauce was ok. Texture of the chicken tasted boiled then lightly grilled in a pan maybe? No smoky grilled flavor, chicken tasted very soft like it has been marinated for way too long or old.
Pad see ew was ok. Noodles were too soft for me and not enough flavor,very bland. Not enough veggies.
Husband received a wrong order. We just kept it since he ate it, and cancelled the other order. It was a panang pork, very small plate.
Thai tea was decent but not worth $5.
Any of the Thai restaurants in Henderson would have been a better choice. I am so disappointed. 
Waitress wanted me to order more food. And thought we should keep the wrong order and still get our other order because she said it's to much food.We were both like No! We are not going to pay $9 for your mistake. If the food was any good I wouldn't have mind but I'm not going to pay for more gross food. 
My husband is not a very picky eater so he did eat most of his food. I had one bite and stopped."}
{"text":"I had eaten there four times previously (in 2005, 2006 and 2007) and enjoyed it as a free-flying single gal.  Then I got married and had a baby.  In our first date in a long while (2012), I booked a table for Lotus of Siam.  The food was okay, but not as good as I'd remembered, but the worst part of it was when I saw a large cockroach--yes, a COCKROACH!!--and I could only gape and point speechlessly.  My husband killed the cockroach and informed our waiter, who took it away but did not apologize or call the manager to apologize.  No recompense was offered at all.  I would have complained further, but my husband did not want to press the issue, so we left quietly.  Maybe bugs are par for the course in an old building downtown, but it was not pleasant to have one sharing our dining experience."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Las Vegas -- make sure you get a reservation because it fills up quickly. Second time we have been here and our group loved it once again. It had been 4 years since we had gone initially and it was exactly what we remembered.

When ordering for spice, I would say shade about 1-2 degrees lower then what you think you can handle, because their degrees are higher then what we usually see here in DC."}
{"text":"i had dinner with family last week for spring break vacation, i saw lots of reviews & wanted to try, but i was so disappointed. The service so bad, host lied to give me bigger table, she put 5 of us in tiny table, the portion of entry was so little, whole family had to eat somewhere after dinning there. I don't think i ever come back this place again...."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand, I'm picky about the food. This place certainly earns five stars. Get the papaya salad and duck curry. And stay away from the other establishments in the strip mall. Ew."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Thai place you must try the garlic shrimp possibly the best in the world."}
{"text":"Wow... Lotus of Siam. More like Lotus of Heaven. I have been to Vegas at least a dozen times and have never been here.  My most recent trip I heard all the hubbub and had to check it out.  I went with a party of six and we were seated promptly. 

Let me start off my saying the this place is deceiving. The small entrance when you first walk in makes it appear extremely small but once you walk past the front it has a huge interior and is very open. 

We started off with some drinks. Your usually beers. Water. Iced Thai coffee is absolutely best I have had. Simply delicious. 

The wait staff was friendly and courteous and always on time with the drinks. And the food came out quickly. 

We ordered stuffed chicken wing, crispy duck panang, garlic prawns, khao soi, and the Tom kah kai soup.  My personal favorite was the soup but everything was absolutely amazing. The place is not known for nothing. It was packed and everyone had a look of delight on their face. 

Between the atmosphere. The friendly staff and the heavenly dishes Lotus of Siam gets 5 stars from me and will be added to the list of places to visit when in Vegas. 

One more thing... what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas when it comes to Lotus of Siam because I will share and recommend this place to everyone. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is my #1 go to Thai joint in town! 

I have been to lotus too many times to count. I feel like a seasoned vet in there and have tried just about every item on the menu. 

I believe it's one of the only places in town you can get Khao Soi and it's the best I've had anywhere in the world. You can find Khao Sou along a cornucopia of other Thai delicacies on the \"Northern Menu\". 

Two thumbs up Wayne!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it 2 star but i told myself may be the cook had a bad day.   Also, the 3rd star is for the good service.

I found this place while looking up on chef Claude Le Tohic of Joel Robuchon.  Tohic won Best Chef Southwest 2010 from the James Beard foundation  (well deserved), beating Saipin Chutima, of Lotus of Siam and Rick Moonen, of RM Seafood.   

The restaurant walls were covered with framed pictures of the chef/owner and celebrities.  I was excited but when the food arrived i was quite disappointed because it was way too salty for my taste even after i asked the waiter to tell the cook to use less salt (from my experience with most Thai places that i have been to) :-(((

CHARBROILED PRAWN with spicy sauce and tamarind sauce  --- While the prawn were perfectly grilled the green sauce were toooooo salty!

SOM THUM (Thai papaya salad)

NUA NAM TOK (Sliced charbroiled beef mixed with green onion, chili, lime juice & rice powder)  ---- This dish was too wet and the rice powder flavor and texture was buried.

THUM-KA-NOON (shredded young jack fruit, ground pork, tomato, Northern Thai spices and seasoned )  --- the jack fruit and pork was too finely shredded/choped and the dish became mushy. 

TOM YUM SEA BASS (Hot and sour soup with Sea Bass, lime juice, lemon grass and straw mushroom) --- for $23.95 this dish is waaaay overpriced because there was only a tiny amount of fish in small pieces :-( ... we chose 3 out 10 scale for chili hot and it was not hot enough for us, 6 was probably what we should have chosen.

PAD THAI --- nothing special, i've had much better.

MINT AND GREEN CHILI chicken stir-fried --- this was probably the best dish in term of doneness and saltiness 

KANA MOO KROB-Stir-fried Chinese broccoli and crispy side pork slice with oyster flavored sauce

I am really surprise that this place was nominated by the James Beard Foundation, for putting the cooking here on the same par with that of Claude Le Tohic of Joel Robuchon.  May be i should i give it another chance? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner. Heard about this place on Top Chef. It is totally worth it! We arrived an hour early for dinner. It would not look like it from the outside but this place is very nice, the service is very good, the atmosphere is so comfortable, and the food is exploding with flavor! We had what the waiter recommended was their most top rated dishes. He was spot on. The prawns were huge and cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and so juicy inside. The soup had many levels of flavor but everything worked together. I could have a whole pot of Tom Kah Kai. The servers were so polite and quick. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but hype doesn't mean you can slack on service. We went for lunch for the first time and arrived at 1:20. They sold us on a buffet they closed 20 minutes prior but did not mention it. We paid for a half full buffet they had no intention of re-stocking and didn't care when we asked about why they didn't tell us. 

We paid $30.00 to not eat here.

So disappointing!"}
{"text":"The service was good, didn't make a reservation and they sat me although they were slightly busy for a Tuesday evening.  I can imagine how busy this place gets on weekends.  I kept it simple had the chicken wontons which were great with the sweet and sour sauce, The crab fried rice was good maybe use more visual crab, and the Garlic prawns which were very good however good have been better if they came with a dipping sauce or something.  It looks like a hole in the wall from outside but pretty nice inside.  I would come back again.  They have a very large menu so be prepared to have a lot of decisions to make."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years, other than getting the occasional buffet lunch.  Four of us set out to try some of their signature dishes, and we are now HOOKED!  We started with a glass of wine at the bar - by the way they are a Wine Spectator Restaurant Award winner.

My sister and I decided we would make it a tradition to try the chicken wings at any restaurant that offered them, and what a wonderful tradition it is!  The Spicy Chicken Wings were wonderful, with a slightly sweet yet complex flavor of chili with hints of basil.  We also chose Nam Kao Tod as an appetizer - we'll definitely do this one again!  The crispy rice was a wonderful texture with the meat and ginger sauce.

We were feeling adventurous and decided to try the who deep fried catfish.  There are 3 kinds, and we tried the Plar Dook O-Cha.  I swear this was the best catfish I've ever had.  Hands down.  It was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender.  The slaw-like vegetables on top had a hint of sweetness, and they paired perfectly with the fish and the Reisling we had with dinner.

The guys picked out a Northern Thai dish that I can't remember - all I know is that it was very, very good.

This is definitely on our go-to list to try again and again!"}
{"text":"Food good. Prompt service. Beautiful restaurant. Huge space. Authentic Thai. Wonderful northern food. Good place for hanging out. Love their decor. Recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"One of my friends who live in Vegas recommended this restaurant so I had to try it. Also heard that this is the 45 best restaurants in the US! The wait can be a little aggravating but you can put your name on the waitlist online and it'll tell you the wait time. They also text you when your table is ready and if you need a little more time to arrive. 

I got the tom yum soup and the garlic prawns. Both were very delicious! The garlic prawns were really crunchy, which I liked. They also have a huge selection of wine for those who love wine. 

The service was actually okay. Maybe because they were so busy but I didn't mind as much since they were friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is very very hyped up.
In my opinion kind of overrated.

They have pretty yummy soups. 
They are always super packed so they take FOREVER!

I think the food is good, but honestly I had better.
The menu is a freaking encyclopedia, so maybe I just haven't ordered the right thing?

It is a local fave, so maybe it's worth giving it another chance."}
{"text":"Had tickets to a show at 7:30. Knew that this place reopened at 5:30. Made me nervous. Called to make reservations during their lunch time, but no one answered. Thought that odd. We arrived 5:20. There was already a line. Hostess came out to the group. Asked if anyone had reservations. I was peeved, cause I had called several times but no one picked up. Wonder how they had managed to get the woman to answer. Would we make the time deadline with just a smile and a walk in? But, who knew how big the place actually was. It's really much bigger than it appeared. Thank goodness. We were ushered in and the server was right there. The menu was incredibly extensive. At first sight, there were many items in the $12.00-14.00 range. Then there was the twenty five to thirty range. Like America, the middle class is vanishing. So were the menu items between the inexpensive to the expensive. I asked about he duck curry ($12.00). The waiter said the $26.00 one was better.  Of course it would be... The menu was filled with great choices that could cater to almost anyone's palate. I got the cheap duck curry, she got the drunken noodle seafood, and her husband got the beef salad. The amazing thing was the speed the food arrived at the table. I've seen buffet lines take longer. Each of the food items was very good. However, did feel that the medium spice was really not spicy at all. His beef salad, also medium spice, had a nice kick. I did find the proportion size of each to be small. Too small? Yes. Very tasty? Yes indeed. Service was lightening fast. The food choice on the menu was expansive. Taste was very very good. Just could have eaten a little more. But hey. I'm not European, satisfied with minimal food decorated by a blank plate background. I would come back, but, I'd order the expensive items as a challenge. O btw, made it to the show on time. Good night was had by all."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST Thai food I've had. EVER. And I've had some good Thai food in Cali! 6 out of 5 stars, unofficially. The menu is HUGE, if only I could eventually get to every single one. That would be quite a feat...hmm...new blog ideas brewing. I had the very wonderful fortune of going with veterans of ordering at Lotus of Siam. I don't think I even opened the menu! They just knew exactly what to order, and I merely sat, anticipating each dish to enjoy.

In all seriousness, though...this place is beyond awesome. All the dishes we ordered were great! Make sure you know your spice levels. I LOVE spicy food, even if it hurts later. Just deal with it, folks.

My favorite: Tom Yum Kai -- the Tom Yum soup with chicken. WOW. It was the perfect amount of lemongrass and spice. I think by the end, it was a little spicy for us...but just make sure to pace yourself. I love putting some rice in my soup to help balance out the textures and also the spiciness. If you really like the lemongrass taste and the spice, get like a medium level spice (maybe something like a 5) and enjoy! This soup came out with the papaya salad (review of it down below), which was a little too much spice all at once. I saved some of my papaya salad to eat with the other dishes, since that's just a little too much spiciness to have together without anything else to balance it out.

What else we ordered (EVERYTHING was delicious):

Crispy duck: wow, it was very crispy and flavorful! Loved this dish, will definitely get it again next time. I see that a lot of people order this as a curry dish. I wonder if it makes a difference in the flavor of the duck itself, or even the curry itself? Well we had already ordered a separate curry noodle dish, so I guess I'm pretty happy with this choice. It keeps the integrity of the crunch and makes it crispy longer, that way. 

Garlic prawns: OK, so speaking of crispy. Holy Crispy Crunchy Crackling Goodness, Batman! Cap'n Crunch is put to shame. This is seriously one of the THE BEST crispy prawns I've had. I don't normally eat the shell of prawns, but I ate every tiny little crunchy bite of this prawn down to the tail. Oh my goodness, that's how good it is. Another great idea I had: make this into a bag of \"chips\" and I would buy the whole factory. For reals, though. Could someone please come up with that? It's nothing like the Shrimp flavored snacks that you find in Asian markets. This would have to replicate the crunch and flavor of this exact garlic prawn dish. Do it and let me know. 

Braised beef short ribs over noodles: I actually can't remember how this dish was...I think I was too busy with the other stuff above...Ooops. I guess I won't be ordering this dish next time LOL. 

Papaya Salad: I don't know why I'm adding this at the end, even though it was one of the first dishes that came out. It was really good and fresh, as far as papaya salads go. I feel like this dish was a little overpowered by all the other dishes, so I'm sorry that this became like the poor neglected pet who gets shoo-ed away when a new baby arrives in the family. 

I think I've written enough now. I hope you guys enjoy this place as much as I did! I really can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai I have ever had!  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Be prepared for some waiting to get a table though.  There is a bar to wait though."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night at 9:30pm with a party of five!  The menu is immense but we did some research before hand so knew what we would be ordering ahead of time.  We had reservations and were seated right away!

Tom kah Kai - (3.5 stars)  broth was amazing!  The lime accent was perfect and the coconut was not too overwhelming.  The chicken however did taste old.  If the chicken was more fresh and tender this dish would be a five!  Maybe it was an end of the night issue.. chicken sitting for to long in the back in the pot.
Sea bass drunken noodles - (4.5 stars) the Seanad was super tender and the light breaking was perfect.  The drunken noodles were delicious and the combination was supreme. 
Crispy duck in panang curry- (5 stars!) It had a nice crispy exterior and the meat was tender but not at all fatty. The panang curry sauce was a great compliment to the duck. We finished off the sauce by putting it on everything we could find at the table! 
Garlic prawns - (4 stars) my first prawn was very good with a very nice garlic sauce.  However my second shrimp was very fishy.  So much so that I could not get the taste out of my mouth.  Everyone else that had one said theirs were great so not sure what happened with that one:-(
Nam prik ong - (3 stars) we were super excited to try this as we saw it featured as one of Ming Tsai'd favorites. While it was tasty, the after taste really reminded us of ground beef. Also it comes with a number of veggies for dipping which wasn't as tasty as the pork rinds that also came with the dish. 
Khao soi braised Short rib - (4.5 stars) meat was tender but the real star was the sauce and noodles.  Yummy!
Thai iced tea - (4 stars) very good typical thai ice tea
Fried banana - (3 stars)  ok, not great.  Would not order this again.
Mango and sticky rice - (4 stars) we asked for two orders and they brought them out on one plate.  The mango was delicious but not enough sticky rice

We were a party of five and they added gratuities on our bill which I found off.

Service was ok but not great.  Bus boy was  much more attentive then our waitress.

We will definitively return!  Our bill ended up being around $40 pp including beers and tip!"}
{"text":"The Best Thai food I've ever had. Seriously. And ridiculously inexpensive too! Why waste all that money on mediocre food on the strip when you can get such good stuff a short cab ride away?!

We didn't have a reservation so we got there at 6pm to try to snag a table before the crowds got there. It was still a 20 min wait for us, but not too bad considering how popular this place is. Staff are very nice and helpful too when we ordered. Between the 5 of us, we got the crispy duck drunken noodles, garlic shrimp, jackfruit curry, spicy fried cod filets, nam kao tod, and the shrimp appetizer that is wrapped in bacon and egg roll wrappers, which I don't remember the name of. The description is so much better anyways.

The appetizers came out very quickly and were consumed all too quickly, so we had to wait a little bit before we got our entrees. But it all was so worth it. The food was fresh and so damn good. The shrimp were huge and the crispy duck were super crispy and flavorful! I was worried that the food would be too spicy for me, but everything was great! 

The menu is extensive and there are so many items that I want to try still, I'll definitely be going there for several more trips so I can update with a more comprehensive review!"}
{"text":"Felt like a tourist trap. Most people in our party were vegetarians. The food was blunt and lacked flavor. Id not recommend it"}
{"text":"I have been eating Thai food since 1983 when I was living and working in the region for years. I really never get the kind of taste experience in the U.S. yet I have had a good deal of excellent Thai in the bay area and elsewhere. But this place is obviously a cut above the rest.

The special spicy beef salad is amazing......they take an already excellent Yum Neua dressing and add hoisin sauce to create a masterful dressing like none other. It was killer.

The spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.

Lastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.

Our waiter \"Tea\" is fantastic, great sense of humor.......and knows his stuff. Tea, if you read this thanks again for the tip on the special beef salad.

Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"There is good and bad news for this place. Yes, it is the best Thai restaurants in U.S. with great ambience and services.  The most expansive menu I've ever seen.  The foods,  however,  are not making my grade to deserve more the 3 stars.  We ordered five dishes including their renown drunken noodle with soft shell crab,  Khoa
Soi,  sweet and sour shrimp,  mussel with chili and nam prik oong.  Most dishes are way too sweet...typical for most Thai restaurants in U.S.  Again,  my standards are higher than most Thais because I grew up getting used to my mom's cooking.  My mom learn her cooking in the Thai royal family's kitchen which taught her how to make good Thai dishes.  Any of the dishes I ordered today do not remind me of home cooking."}
{"text":"ambiance//***
definitely one of the most upscale thai restaurants that i've been to
i think the small room you enter is the original restaurant and then they expanded to the other spaces where it's suddenly more spacious and modern with the wine racks

service//**
the service was sorta meh....they were rushing us a bit even though the kitchen wasn't able to send out the food...so i'm not sure what that was about

food//**
yikes! great expectations!
when someone tells me this is one of the best thai places in the country
i'm anticipating mind blowing tastiness w/ explosive flavors and heat

sadly...i received none of the above
garlic shrimp was the most disappointing after all that hype
~*~
this place is hella expensive for the small portions and greasy food
plus there is a ridiculous 60-90 mins wait because of their rep =("}
{"text":"One of my  favorite thai restaurants; It's always busy with locals and now more and more tourists from the strip hotels. Incredible wine list and fast efficient service. If you like thai food this is the place to go in las vegas"}
{"text":"I know, I know.  When the Foodies in my life come to town, Lotus is always on their list.  So I have to say-- I don't get it.  Food is fine.  Not outstanding."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place forever and I finally had a chance to come here. We just drove in from LA and after checking into the hotel we got to lotus at 5 pm and waited 30 min for when they first opened at 5:30pm. They were also very nice and let us sit in the lounge without having to wait outside in the heat. 

Very good service and appreciate that! 

They serve all reservations first but we were lucky to be seated pretty quickly.

We ordered all the chefs specials that were about $30/ per dish. It's like fancy Thai food with way better ingredients.

1. Garlic shrimp- this is extra fried goodness for huge big shrimps!! I think I would only get this if we had more people. Not a big fan of fried food so thought it was too much for just 2 people.

2. Seabass steamed with egg and curry. This was our favorite dish!! And a must have next time. It's Chilean Seabass so it's the best fish out there!! 


3. Crispy duck khao soi - ok I told myself this is the last time I'm getting khao so if it sucks here and it did! It's soggy noodles with curry sauce! And the sauce flavors are great but the noodles really turn me off. They have sour mustrad and onions for garnish. So don't got kissing anyone later!! The duck is good and also fried too. So we felt that we just ordered all the fried dishes! 

4. Plate of broccoli and carrots to be healthy! 

Overall very good and would come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Very good food, but a little slow on service and too much ice on my drink. Had to pay twice for what I consider \"sips\"."}
{"text":"For a Thai restaurant that's somewhat small, located somewhat in the less nicer part of LV, I'm quite surprised and amazed about the accolades this place has received. It might be difficult and often times challenging to get into the restaurant because there's usually a wait, and people shuffling to get in or get out. 

When you finally get to be inside, (assuming that you might have to wait outside of the restaurant for a bit) and get a chance to see all the pictures of the celebrities that came into the restaurant, you can't help but wonder how the heck Lotus of Siam got the chance to entertain the celebrities they had the opportunity to cook for. This place is somewhat a hole in the wall, and you would think that celebrities would confine themselves to big name restaurants where exclusively rich and powerful dine. Apparently not at Lotus of Siam; all sorts of people (rich, not so rich, big, small, tourists, locals, etc. etc.) come here to enjoy awesome Thai cuisine. 

They have a nice menu that covers all the traditional Thai dishes (pan fried noodles, salads, curries, soups, desserts) + specific specialties that I haven't found at any other Thai restaurant. If you're into hot and spicy, I would suggest taking an antacid before hand cuz their food can get crazy spicy where you'd probably be soaking in your clothes once you're done with your meal. 

I can't tell you a specific dish that stood out because honestly, they're ALL good. Everything is superb in flavor, freshness, overall quality. What did stand out was their prices and quantity. Lotus of Siam is a tad bit more expensive and you get a bit less of food than at other Thai food places. I have confidence that anything you purchase would be a great pick.

Also, while it appears that Lotus of Siam boasts to claim they have an amazing wine selection, I can't voucher for this as I never had the chance to purchase one of their wines there. Just FYI though, in terms of whether or not you're wondering what beverages they pride themselves over...

I'm wavering between a 3/4 starts on this one...Definitely a great Thai food restaurant. Wouldn't say it's the best, but it sure is up there in Thai food places I'd dine in and come to again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place above all the Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Amazing Service and great Duck Curry"}
{"text":"I was very excited to give LOS a shot for lunch after having heard so much about it over the years.  The lunch buffet was the rave of a few of my lunch comrades and DAMN if I didn't even look at the menu.  And because I did not order off the menu, I will forgo only giving Lotus one star.

The buffet came in at $10.99 and was severely  lacking in options.  Not much in the way of anything with meat in it.  The Pad Thai was without meat.  While eating the green chicken curry I was hard pressed to find chicken in it.  Even the chicken wings were without meat.

My Thai Tea ran empty and I would have happily paid ($2.50) for another glass if only the waiter would have cared to ask.  Both the service and hospitality were absolutely lacking.

There are plenty of other outstanding Thai restaurants I would rather pay my hard earned cash to eat at."}
{"text":"The infamous Lotus of Siam. One of the only ways you can drag people out of the strip for a meal. Restaurant completely filled within 15 minutes of opening. 

Food: 
I don't quite get the fuss here about the food. I've been here twice and the food is consistent, but definitely not the best Thai Food I've had. 

Service: 
Attentive staff. They have a lot of employees working here. 

Environment: 
Definitely looks better than your typical Thai joint. Makes a good date location. 

Price: 
Average price for the type of food.

{"text":"Always worth the wait !  A long time staple of the east side of Las Vegas, can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food!

4 stars - Panang curry with fried tofu. This dish also had slices of red bell pepper and onion. Panang curry flavor with some coconut milk for the richness. I wish there was more curry in it though, it would have given the dish more depth. 

4 stars - Drunken noodles with seafood. The noodles and the sauce were very tasty. They seafood included shrimp, squid, mussels, and imitation crab. 

5 stars - Thai tea really hit the spot! It was authentic tasting, had a nice sweetness, and was classically given to me in a glass where the tea was separated from the milk at the top of the glass. Mix it with a straw and have a sip! I wish there was crushed ice instead of cubed, that's just how I was raised on Thai tea, but small detail, so still a five in my book. 

Great Thai food at this restaurant, that tastes home cooked. Who could turn that down?"}
{"text":"If you're craving some bomb af thai food mosey on over to Lotus of Siam, located just a hop skip away off the strip.  

This is as authentic as Thai gets in Vegas. Their menu is extensive so there will be something for everyone.

{"text":"Crispy Duck Panang Curry. Garlic Prawns. 

If you want the best Thai food in Vegas or anywhere within 100s of miles, go here. 

Good God it was so delicious and you would never expect it from the looks of the outside. Located in a shipping center off the strip near the older part of town, you expect a hole-in-the-wall and that's what you get walking in. What you don't know is they expanded to the space next to where they originally opened up and it looks like a Michelin Star restaurant. Service was comparable to a Ruth's Chris or any topend steakhouse. Always catering to your needs although very busy. Huge wine cellar in plain site and all the James Beard and Zagat awards on the wall. 

The food. The food though!!! Don't make the mistake of ordering too much at once. Family style and the steamed white rice is endless. Hot pot Tom Kha Kai to start with medium spice. Super delicious, sour, spicy and the best way to start. Dishes came out shortly after. We also ordered the soft shell crab drunken noodles. The dish was super good but I want to focus on the first two I mentioned. Garlic Prawns. Came with the shells which were also fried. Best. Prawns. Ever. So good. But the true star: crispy duck Panang. Duck came in a lake of curry and still remained crispy. It was so good over rice and we ended up ordering another. 

Go here. Don't even hesitate. Go. You won't regret it. If you can find a better Thai place in the area, I challenge you to say that LoS isn't better. I CHALLENGE YOU! Aite?!?And bring your friends with you cause you might get embarrassed."}
{"text":"Was sooo excited to come and try. The garlic prawns were yummmmyyyy but the rice was so dry and hard! Sooo dissapointed. Any Asian person know a good asian restaurant needs good rice to go with it. Wished it was perfect :(

Came back again :) ok so you have to try their northern food - OMG to die for!!"}
{"text":"Ehh bf took me here don't like it, he doesn't know what to order rather eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"Recommend it!

Really try the Crispy Duck! With any of its optional servings.
Quality and consistency. 

Crispy prawns also good. 

Decent environment, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great thai food off the strip of vegas.  Only complaint is the portions tend to be on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. One drawback is the wait times. But the quality of the food is top notch and worth the wait. Extensive wine list for excellent pairing with your meal. Go-to's have been the Pad Thai and the Roasted Duck Curry. Go here! Trust the fat kid"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful!  We had the papaya salad and crab fried rice.  Also had the chicken Larb, was a bit salty, Garlic prawns was good.  We went without a reservation on a Sunday, party of two, we ended up eating at the bar area, which is first come first serve.  Way better than waiting over an hour for a table.  They do take reservations but gotta make one at least 2 months out!"}
{"text":"This joint is hands down the best thai food restaurant I've ever ever eaten. It is also one of the best restaurants I've eaten, period.
The only down is that it is always packed and lines are expected."}
{"text":"Finally moved to a place where I feel safe to step out of the car! This place used to be in a very shady area, so I'll be going here more in person when I'm in Vegas for work :) 

Reservations can made but have to be made weeks in advance as they get packed pretty quickly. Tried squeezing in an early evening dinner a week in advance and lady told us it was already full. 

This place is on the pricier side, but the food is definitely worth it. We got the crispy duck on drunken noodle and the chu chee prawn. The latter wasn't anything special (prawns curry), but the crispy duck noodle was excellent. Highly recommend.

Parking can be a pain. We usually have to park across the street."}
{"text":"Had lunch bc they were totally full for dinner. Very popular place. Lunch you don't need a reservation. Had the whole snapper, mee krob, and papaya salad. Really good bottle of Riesling was a perfect pairing- and affordable. So happy to have found this gem. It's a must do when in Vegas. I've been to Thailand twice and this measures up. Do it!"}
{"text":"What took me so long to come here and eat?!  Lotus of Siam has long held the reputation of being one of the top Thai restaurants in the country and I finally got to experience the bombness of this place!  Perhaps, it's because of the location.  It is in a very seedy party of town that LOOKS seedy during the day and even seedier at night.  Great food found in a dumpy strip mall?  Perfect.

We went during lunch time and did not go with the lunch buffet.  As advised by on of our Lotus of Siam experience friends, we chose to order from the menu instead and it was the way to go!  I think everything we chose was deep fried in some form or another, which lead to a cholesterol fest of food.  I'm getting older, so that stuff don't phase me (yet).

- Our introduction was Garlic Prawns.  Crispy + salty = good.

- Next came the Chilean Seabass and Drunken Noodles and Crispy Duck Panang.  Flavors were on the saltier side, but again, I am a sucker for CRISPY!!

- My most favorite dish was Nam Koi Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice).  I've never had this dish before anywhere, so it was a fun new dish.  Crispy crunchy rice with the fragrant flavors of all the fixings left a party in my mouth!

Conclusion:  Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype.  Will definitely go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"We were directed to this place by a friend of ours who ate there a few weeks ago. We're really glad we tried it. No it's not in the fancy area of Las Vegas but don't let that dissuade you. Their food is really good and the service is even better. They also have an unbelievable wine selection."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype! Not only is the cuisine mouth wateringly succulent, the service is second to none. We drove to the restaurant in a small SUV on the freeway on a Saturday night. We arrived at 6:00 without a reservation. The kind, little Oriental woman who greeted us said the wait would be 60 minutes. We were shoveling delicious Thai food down our throats by 6:30. During our surprisingly short wait, we met a great man named Terry who washed our windows. Our waiter Joe recommended several delicious dishes to try. The menu has tons of options and you will not believe the wine cellar. I felt like I walked out of a Burmese jungle and into the Napa Valley by simply walking from my table to the restroom. I ordered the khao soi and it was stupid fresh and tender. The real highlight of our visit was when the world renowned funny man, Jim Belushi waltzed in. Do not let the long waits sway your decision. I'm not saying this is the best food in Las Vegas; I'm saying this is the best food in the world. We had coconut ice cream and sticky rice with mangos for dessert. We departed from the restaurant and drove home with grateful hearts and full bellies."}
{"text":"It's a tuesday night, as i walk in there is a 20 minute wait. Good sign, but i'm hungry so it better not be a long 20 min. A friend and i head over to the bar. great beer selection. Being from Southern California we were ecstatic to find Stone here. When you walk in you see a gorgeous
 glass walled wine cellar. The place is clean, bathrooms are clean as well.

25 min go by, finally seated. Got some thai tea, balanced just right. Chicken satay for an appetizer, chicken grilled just right. Peanut sauce and cucumber medley paired with it perfectly.

Panang Curry with Shrimp
absolutely DELICIOUS, i am very picky with my curries because there always seems like there's something off.. Too much coconut milk, not enough spice, too much spice, too sweet. Not this place, perfect balance of flavors, no complaints here.

Roasted Duck with Red Pineapple Curry: my friend got this and loved it. i had to dip in my fork of course and the duck was perfect. Even tho it was covered in curry you could still taste the crispness of the duck skin, and the medley of fat and meat in your mouth was awesome. He did however say he got a 6 in hotness and it was almost too much for him!

Dessert:
Mango Sticky Rice and Fried Banana.
basically 2 thai dessert staples. It's very hard to mess this up and they didn't. Mangoes were fresh, and the fried banana had just the right amount of sweet and crisp.

Had a great experience here. Server was rushed, but sweet. Will definitely come back, why the 4 stars you ask? Nothing beats my Thai aunts food. That's why :]"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant outside of Thailand! If you don't know Thai food, your server will ask your preferences - tastes and level of spiciness - and make great recommendations, including reasonably priced and perfectly suited wines. If you love Thai food, you will find all your favorite dishes and always something new to try. You cannot go wrong here. Dinner is the thing to do, as lunch is a typical buffet thing. It's east of the Strip on Sahara in a weird kind of industrial complex - drive it or cab it, don't walk - but once you're in the restaurant, you will be in another world, a world of exquisite taste and service. Truly a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor - make a reservation! 

The restaurant lacks ambiance and is located in a shady strip mall where people will approach you asking if they can wash your car windows for money.

However, the food is delicious! It's different from most Thai places because they focus on a different region. Super spicy. Wish they'd move back to SoCal."}
{"text":"If I can use one word to describe the food at this place it would be FLAVORFUL. This was my first time visiting Lotus of Siam and I must say I was impressed. I am not huge Thai food fan, nor do I opt for spicy food given the choice, but I will definitely be returning to LOS. We ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup with chicken (very different from what I am accustomed to, but extremely delicious), duck curry (spicy and delicious), sweet and sour chicken (AWESOME, i ordered a batch to go after the dinner) and I forgot what the last entree was but it was chopped up pork that was very minty with flavorful spices. Overall service was friendly but not pushy, prices reasonable and food delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was once a great place.. Now has jumped the shark.  Had a late dinner.  Felt very rushed to get us out the door.  Has lost its personal feel and now pushes out rushed average cuisine where once meals defined my Vegas trip.  
To add a personal touch.. We walked out with no thank you or good bye and the first thing we see is a new Benz parked in the first space with a LotusSiam licensed plate.  I guess owners car and if true very tacky.  
I'm all about making money but you better not lose what made you great in the first place.  I hope they focus on food and customer service in the future."}
{"text":"Took two tries to actually eat here. First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy \"clubs.\" None of the restaurants seemed to be \"hopping.\" Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food. Especially if you flew in from out of town - paying a king's ransom for cab fare from the strip and back as well as the long wait will seem much more worth it."}
{"text":"We arrived right at opening on a Monday night and there was already a half hour wait but we managed to snag the last two chairs at the bar. My husband  gave into the pad Thai and I had the duck panang curry. Both dishes exceeded our expectations!! We were lucky getting seats, and when we left there were two sets of people waiting for our spot. Excellent food, worthy of dill the great reviews! Thank you Yelp"}
{"text":"First time experience with northern Thai.   Noisy.  Did not have to wait for a table on Wednesday night.  No reservation!   The larb is  good and spicy at a level 5.   Any more would be too hot."}
{"text":"Great thai food.  Came right at their opening for lunch on a Monday morning, 11:30am.  No wait but it quickly filled up by the time we left around 1:00pm ish.  Had pad thai, duck curry, a suggested pork dish, and their sea bass over drunken noodles.  

All of it was good, well balanced with flavors.  Not sure what it is with drunken noodles but it works.  The waitress recommended us to pair our sea bass with it and we're glad we listened.  They miss most of the pad thai for you when its served except for the nuts.  We went through half of before we realized it and finished mixing it in.  

The thai tea was on the sweet side so we added water to ours.  

We'd be back to try different dishes when we're in town."}
{"text":"I actually have eaten here three times now.  Friends of mine that live in vegas took me to eat here, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys thai food.  The prawns, chicken wings, fried catfish are delicious, and this is probably one of the best places I've eaten at for Thai food in the states.  They get extra points for making it tasty spicy.  They recently bought the next door lot and made their restaurant bigger, so previously painfjul waits are much better."}
{"text":"Really large menu to really make a good judgement on one visit  but had the green curry chicken which was very good.   Fried wrapped banana appetizer was good but overpriced.    Place is reasonably priced but it's easy to spend allot.   Very good personable service.   Best to rsvp in advance and when the city is busy with conventions rsvp far in advance to be sure.."}
{"text":"Wow Don't judge a place by its cover, we pulled up and I was skeptical but wow was I wrong, this place is delectable we shared a bunch of dishes and every bite was mouth watering! A must experience place!"}
{"text":"A Thai person recommended this spot to me so I already knew this was the good-good. 

Hidden gem in Las Vegas. 

Superb. Excellent. Met my expectations. 

Get the fried garlic shrimp. My favorite thing on the menu and well worth the price."}
{"text":"The new location in E flamingo is open! 
We went there on a Thursday  night for dinner. We had a reservation and as soon as we walked in we got seated which was great since I've heard that the previous location had a long wait. 
Staff is amazing. 
Food is delicious. We started with crispy rice (5/5) and for he main dish I had yellow curry (5/5). I can't handle spicy food so I ordered 1. I was so impressed and pleased that I didn't leave my mouth on fire.
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've come here several times over the last two years.  I still love this place, and is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.  However the same dish can vary a bit each time.  For example, level 6 spiciness is not always the same sometimes hotter sometimes milder and also the ingredient change too although overall the dish is still familiar.  On our last visit, I noticed the portions have gotten alot smaller too.  I would rather the prices increase than the portions getting smaller.

Nonetheless, I love this place for the extensive wine list which is rare for most Thai places.  Secondly, the service is always good in spite of it being crazy busy almost all the time."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas......everything is delicious, my only BUTS are service and location.....restaurant is not very cozy or nice, and parking lot is very ghetto but I do really love the food......the dishes that have charbroiled steak are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Located off the Strip in a seedy looking little industrial strip mall, you probably wouldn't give this place a second glance. But you would be missing out! Lotus of Siam has amazing food and a wine selection to rival most fine Italian restaurants and steakhouses. 

My husband and I first dined here in March of this year. He had heard about it on Yelp and all the reviews said to try the buffet. Unfortunately it's just a lunchtime buffet and we had missed it for the day, so we ordered off the menu. We were not disappointed. Our server suggested the Drunken Noodle Prawns and we also ordered Pad Prik King chicken. Both were outstanding. Our server was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was very clean. We had a wonderful Italian red wine with our meal that made it absolutely perfect.

Today we had the opportunity to try the lunch buffet. It's $10.99 and served from 11:30-2:30. While there aren't a whole lot of items on the buffet, the dishes they have are fantastic. Drunken Noodles, Green Curry Chicken, and Pad Thai were my favorites. The Chow Mein, not something I would normally order, was also very good. We tried the two Thai beers and both were quite good. 

I have nothing but praise for Lotus of Siam. I've added it to the list of places I have to visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh lotus of Siam. ...my stomach really hates you.  Seriously you did some major trauma down there.  Was it worth it?  Nope.  
Very overrated tourist trap.  We had the buffet so my expectations were low and I was still disappointed.
Pad Thai was very average.  Fried rice bland.  Mint Chili chicken was okay but had a strange texture.  Eggrolls had almost no filling.  
Our server brought us water without saying a word and we never saw him again.  It felt very odd being ignored by everyone. 
Im glad I went so I know to only bring people I don't like here."}
{"text":"Where do I begin??? This place never disappoints!! The must haves are their garlic prawns, spicy sausage, crispy duck!  I live in Cali but wouldn't mind driving the 4 hours or flying just to eat here"}
{"text":"Yum! yum! yum! yum!

I read the review and decided to try it. the lives up tt the reviews.  it is off the strip , just few light away. i got a pick up , wasn't sure of the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"They didn't get a 5 star rating, because believe it or not they used to be BETTER!!  This place is still great, but once you had the best, it's hard not to want it to continue!

I'm a BIG fan of the green chicken curry! soooooo good!  

I love when the sweet rice and mango are season because that is a treat you don't want to miss!

It is a hidden gem because it isn't in the best of areas or plazas in Las Vegas.  But people know where it is because it has made a name for itself.  

It's a small dining area which makes its cozy.

All in all, if you like thai food and are in vegas, and don't mind straying away from the strip, I would recommend going there."}
{"text":"Some people deem this restaurant the best for Thai food in the world. I wouldn't go that far as I have had my fair share across the globe but it is definitely one of the better restaurants in Vegas for Thai. The location is far from exceptional but the staff is friendly and the food is extraordinary. If you come on a weekend without a reservation be prepared for an extreme wait time."}
{"text":"Big Fan of Mrs. Redd's pies!!! Every flavor, especially lemon.
But I am missing them terribly since the Food 4 Less closed in Vegas Valley.
It is most unfortunate the Kroger chain does not carry these in every store...ie Smith's. SO Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"All I want to say is... NO!!
What a MASSIVE disappointment! Best Thai food in LV??? In the US??? NOT! 
The place is nestled in a scary abandoned looking strip mall. Real seedy joint. We almost didn't go in based on that. We should've kept our 1st mind. I know there are loads of positive reviews here... Trust them at your own risk.

We came for early dinner on Friday. No waiting. Great! The sever... Well it took us till the end of dinner to determine who our server really was... He was the worst part of our experience. We ordered Pad Thai, Panang curry, and Seafood Thai Fried Rice. The Pad Thai smelled awful. We didn't eat it. Wanted to send it back, but we were told by the server \"It's not my fault, you ordered, someone has to pay for it.\" Excuse me?!? Nuff said. We'll NEVER BE BACK. Asked for the manager, and we were treated like criminals.

The portions here are small for the prices. Truly nothing to swoon over as far as taste. I've learned that Food Network is not always right. Restaurants probably pay to be on TV. 
I'm sure they weren't treated the way we were for not liking an entree'.

Someone suggested Archie's to us. We'll try them next time we're in Vegas. Stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Location is a bit sketchy but well worth it. Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it opened.  Been to just about every thai place in town and I always come back to this place.  It's a local secret!!  If your a fan of Thai food, you have to check this place out.  The staff has always givin great service to me but I have been going here since I can remember."}
{"text":"I was very glad to try this restaurant I've bookmarked since I saw their episode on \"The Best I Ever Ate.\" I've heard they were great. Also, this was the meeting place for my first UYE lunch!

First, I'll say it was awesome to meet fellow Yelpers who were in town for our Yelp Spring Break. 

As for the overall food experience here, I'd have to give it 3 stars for sure. It took a while after we were seated for us to receive menus. The server was very nice and friendly, it did get pretty busy at the end of our meal, but the service wasn't as prompt as it could've been. Our food arrived pretty fast, but it just took an unusually long time to order and to get our check at the end.

I tried the Khao Soi with beef. I usually always go with what the server recommends to me. It was decent, honestly. People around me tried the Nam Prik Hed and the soup Tom Kha Kai. Everyone said the food tasted fairly good. 

I'd definitely want to come back to try a meal again. Try a different dish perhaps. Hopefully a better updated review to come..."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Further down away from the Las Vegas Strip, so would be better if you have a car to get here
- Decent size parking lot available in the plaza and around
- Very big restaurant, suitable for large groups
- Staff are friendly. Provided good recommendations and suggestions. Also quick with orders and attentive making sure we have enough water

Food
- Ordered several items to share, which includes curry, pad thai, kao sai and a stir-fried thick noodle dish
- Everything was pretty good!
- Curry was not spicy, actually a little kick that compliment very well with the rice and the duck
- Pad thai was little standard, but not too oily compared to other place
- Kao sai was my least favourite as I thought they egg noodles were tough to chew (all stuck together)
- Stir-fried thick noodle reminds me a lot of a Chinese dish I usually eat, which is very comforting and compliment well with the seafood dishes


This is a nice restaurant to try if you want to taste something outside the hotel casinos."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed eating at Lotus. This is the only restaurant I have eaten at two nights in a row. The only restaurant I will wait an hour to get in.  I have eaten here at least a dozen times over the last three years. I always go with big groups no one has ever been disappointed. The garlic prawns, drunken noodle shrimp, Tom Kai soup and sea bass are amazingly good. I don't eat duck I really don't like it normally, but here they make it so juice and good that I love it.  I love the Chang beer it goes perfect with your meal. I recently have tried the rice with mango and it was delicious.

Hands down my go to restaurant when I am visiting Vegas."}

{"text":"***Lotus of Siam is a very good Thai restaurant and easily the best value I've ever had in Vegas, which is filled with overpriced and mediocre restaurants***

Lotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).

The menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.

(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.

(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.

(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.

(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.

(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.

(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.

(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.

(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.

(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.

Service was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).

Prices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.

While I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.

The strip mall has a huge and free parking lot."}
{"text":"Thought my friends were exaggerating. But they were right! This is the best Thai food I ever had!  Garlic shrimp is to die for! Not too salty just perfect! The duck in panang curry sauce. So yummy. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes! I hear it's usually really busy but we can on a Monday afternoon and their was no wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Authentic Thai food from different regions of Thailand. My only regret is that I didn't get to try more dishes! 

1. Opened at 11am on Monday 
2. BBQ chicken was moist and flavorful!
3. Red curry, chicken friend rice, and drunkin noodles were all on point. 
4. Next time I'm trying the green curry and pork sausage! 

Portions are small, but the dishes were so delicious! I can't wait to eat here again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Im in love with this Hidden Vegas GEM living here I have to say its one of the best"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! People take trips here via taxis from the Strip. 

Food is dee-lish with a wide range of wine. I eat a lot of Thai food from LA to NY and this place sticks out!

Featured in Top Chef Master (Las Vegas). When I saw this episode, I was hollaaaaa-ing \"I was there!!\". This place is excellent and always packed. Way worth the trip; try everything! Come hungry.

Food: Sea bass with Pad Kee Mao (5/5)
Drinks: 2 full cups of the best Thai tea everrrr!! (6/5)"}
{"text":"My friends and I heard lots of great reviews about this place so we decided to come here for dinner. 

Had called in to make a reservation of 15 but ended up waiting for 30 mins. Our server was great. She had a monkey clip in her hair which made us laugh. The food came out super slow. Not surprised because the place was packed! 

Everything was really tasty (or maybe i was really hungry)! Left the place with a happy belly.

Three days later I had this awful stomach flu. Found out most of my friends had caught the stomach flu that night! It was horrible! 

I'm super sad because I was planning to go back. Papaya salad was spicy but addicting. Beef salad was yummy. Fried rice was soo good. The crispy duck was to die for. Tom yum & chicken curry was average. Fried fish was fresh.

Maybe we were being too loud and they had added an extra flavor to our foods. Eh, not coming back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in my life. 

The crispy duck was excellent; the garlic prawns were delicious as well. Pretty much, everything from the Pad Thai to their meat dishes are a pretty big step up from your typical Thai cuisine, with the exception of the Pad See Ew, which was just as good as any other Thai place- just not better. 

Off strip, but worth it."}
{"text":"Its ok. Nothing special. The location is not that great  the interior is a little  dated but clean. Fast service though."}
{"text":"Authentic that food. Really tasty.  Drunken noodles are really good. Been there on last two Vegas visits and will go again for sure the next time I return"}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!
If you haven't been to Lotus of Siam, you have definitely been missing out all your life...
It may not look like much from the outside but the space is quite big inside. AT FIRST, it may seem like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. That's where the quote 'don't judge a book by it's cover' comes in.

O M G the food is to DIE for, the service is amazing, wine cellar is crazy, and did I say the food is to die for?!?!
I came with a large party of about 15 of us on a Saturday evening. Apparently there is quite a long wait here but I didn't wait at all. Perhaps you should go right when they open at 5:30 pm. 

FOOD
I'm not exactly sure of the names of everything we ordered because the waiter recommended it all and we just went with the flow. We had a variety of dishes (3 of each one) that were all equally delicious and perfect in taste!!! My favorites were probably the Garlic Prawns (GIANT prawns perfectly battered and seasoned), the Crispy Duck Penang (oh my gosh), Papaya Salad (fresh, crispy salad), Pad Thai (just plain DELISH). 
The CRISPY DUCK PENANG is seriously the bombbbbbbb. It's perfectly fried, juicy and the curry sauce is sooooo good omg. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. The Riesling wine was also delicious and went well with all of the food.

SERVICE
The service was great! The servers constantly refilled our water and asked if we were enjoying our food. However, we were there for a birthday celebration and when he asked if he should bring out the cake, I told him we needed a bit more time but they brought it out with the candles lit (perhaps he misunderstood me..?). We had to ask him to blow it out and wait a little bit because we were waiting for the rest of our party to come back to their seats. After about 5-10 minutes he lit the candles again and started giving us the cake again even though we were still waiting for our party to sit back down so we just had to do the cake. This part was a bit rushed but it was fine. The service while we were dining was good and I have no complaints other than the cake incident haha.

PARKING
There is a vast amount of parking as there is a hugeee lot out front. 

Lotus of Siam is definitely a MUST TRY restaurant when you're in Vegas. I wish they had a location in Los Angeles T-T... I would go everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Portion is OK. I love sticky rice and mango with coconut ice cream. It was not on the menu. Server suggested it to us without telling us the extra cost of the ice cream was almost half of the dessert ."}
{"text":"Ok,  so we all know lotus of siam now. I feel like it's so hyped up that people are disappointed when they finally get here. Let's be clear,  the reason for the hype and the reason for the James Beard and Michelin stars is because of the northern Thai Cuisine offered. There are things on this menu that you cannot find anywhere else. If you're judge of good Thai food is chicken pad thai, you may or may not be disappointed in that it's not going to rock your world some how, or really be that different from the other Thai restaurants you've been to(However, the pad thai here is excellent haha). 

The thing I really want to get into is the wine. Oh that wine!!! You walk in and there's a giant wine room staring you in the face... Those are just the whites! I'm so impressed by the wine list. Whether or not you come here for the Thai food, you really should come here for the wine. Any somm or home-schooled somm would be in heaven geeking out over the wine list, splitting a bottle and possibly an appetizer... Or you know that duck panang they're so famous for."}
{"text":"Came here to check out whether all the hype is true. Well, I'm happy to say that Lotus of Siam (almost) lived up to the expectations.
Food is delicious and service is friendly but I always get grossed out by places where they use those big plastic bins to clear tables. Wine list is decent but not as sophisticated as Chada Thai's.
The bottom line: Lotus of Siam is decent but I prefer Chada Thai."}
{"text":"Reduced portions and the soup was watered down. This place used to be good. I don't know what happened. Told staff that we were unhappy but they didn't care :/"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally did. They have a huge loyal following and the place was packed on a Wednesday evening. The food and service were very good. My favorite dishes were the jumbo garlic prawns and the curry dish. The interior is pretty big and the wine area was pretty impressive. I'm sure I'd want to fight traffic often to go here with so many Thai places closer to my house. Having said that, I'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"The food at Lotus of Siam is so incredibly full of flavor and spice. You know that feeling when something's so spicy it's burning your mouth and you KNOW it's bad for you, but the food is too delicious to stop eating? My nose was in a constant state of runny but I ate so much I could barely make it to my show afterwards.

p.s. - There was a second Lotus of Siam that opened in NYC years ago, but it fell sorely short of expectations after having tried the original."}
{"text":"Been trying to go here for years. If I don't have a reservation on the weekend the wait is at least an hour. 

Went the take out route. Food is really good. It's in a seedy part of Vegas but is world renowned. When u walk in there are celebs and food critics pics all over the walls. Glad I was able to experience it."}
{"text":"I visited Lotus of Siam on a recent visit to Vegas.  Honestly, the place was kind of hard to find and the food was okay.  I prefer Thai Basil.  I went there after rave reviews that celebrities visit it when they're in Vegas.  It didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Las Vegas local here saying this is hands down the best and most authentic Thai food in Vegas. Not in the best side of town and a bit tricky to find, but don't let that deter you. It's worth the drive and wait. Usually busy and that's always a great indication the food is going to be good. Fellow foodies know what I'm talking about. If it's good enough for Anthony Bourdain, it's good enough for me. 

My go-to's are the Garlic Prawns and Tom Yum Shrimp Soup (level 9) because i like it hot :) Crab Fried Rice and Northern Larb. My kids love the Chicken Sa-tay with peanut sauce. 

Again, it's gonna be busy no matter what time you show up, just know they take reservations and usually the wait isn't too long. Plenty of parking too."}
{"text":"We ordered the tom kha, tom yum, red snapper, red duck curry, and Thai steak salad. It was all ok. The Tom kha and salad were awesome. The rest was very tiny, for dinner portions. And just about everything came to us cold. I've been there before and it was awesome. My brother, swears by this place. But I wasn't so impressed."}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to its reputation. First meal in Vegas... best meal in Vegas.  Looking forward to my second visit."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had in my life. I would drive to Vegas from San Diego just to eat here."}
{"text":"Just came back from an outstanding meal with a friend. 

Interior: A little dated, and the ceiling had those popcorn asbestos type things on it. BUT WHO CARES?! 

Service: The host was prompt, we had reservations so we were seated right away. Most of the tables were full and this was around 8pm on a Thursday. I can only imagine what the weekend is like. The server was attentive, and the bus service was prompt. It did take a little while for our bill to come after the meal, but who cares, we were stuffed and needed a minute to just sit around anyway. 

Food: MOUTHGASMIC. We ordered:
-Stuffed Chicken Wings 
-Tom Yum Kai (7 spiciness) 
-Yellow Curry Chicken (6 spiciness) 
-Mint and Green Chili Beef
-Sticky Rice 
-Thai Iced Tea

Everything was awesome. The Tom Yum Kai was spiced perfectly, it had the right amount of kick but still retained its sour lime flavor. I wish I had ordered the Yellow Curry in a 8, it was not spicy at all, but the coconut base was still good. This was the first time I had Sticky Rice and i really enjoyed the firm yet soft and sticky texture. I'll be ordering it often. The mint and chili beef was my favorite dish, it was a great mixture of flavors and spices that hits the mouth at all angles. Stuffed chicken wings?...c'mon, so bomb. How is it even possible to make!? It defies the laws of physics and gravity. LOL.  It was very tasty. The thai iced tea was perfect, not too sweet, and very refreshing. 

Overall, possibly the best Thai meal i've ever had. It did not break the bank either. We spent about $53 with tip. I'll definitely be coming back here to sample more fine Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Attended this restaurant following a work conference. It was highly recommend and for good reason. We shared multiple dished between five of us. Every bite was delicious. Along with everyone else I highly recommend the Garlic Prawns. Spicy sea bass was also fantastic. Large wine selection. Bar was very knowledgeable and assisted with a good recommendation. This will become a favorite spot while I am in town for future visits."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and it was worth it. I asked for medium spicy and it was like a 10/10 spicy. Could barely eat our food... :(
-beef salad- spicy but oh so good! Love the charbroiled beef!
-roasted duck curry- on the chewy side but good. Could have been roasted longer. 
-charbroiled beef on top of cabbage. Again beef was good. 

Would I come here again? Heck yes! Just less spicy please."}
{"text":"Time for an update since this is the second time I've been here (technically 3rd time but 1visit we did the buffet.... which reminds me... don't do the buffet)

So once again we ordered the garlic prawns and tom yum koong. Both above average in the scale of deliciousness, i mean WAY ABOVE!! Be warn about the spiciness level on the soup. We did the 7 and would have probably fared better work a 6, and that's coming from people whom normally can spice it up with the rest of em. We also ordered the pud se ew which was great as well. 

This is my personal favorite thai spot now. Too bad i have to cross state borders for it."}
{"text":"very authentic food. would have been nice to know there was no liquor license so we could have brought something to drink. Very flavorful. Service a little slow. definitely get there early or make reservations."}
{"text":"The best Thai food we have ever had. Thai nirvana. We started with the stuffed chicken wings then had duck with drunken noodles and pad Thai. The service was wonderful. It was wayyy less than we typically pay for mediocre Thai food back on the east coast. People complaining about the prices are out of their minds."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Three good reviews that are more specific have been right on the mark and the lesser reviews were extremely picky. We got here at 545 and there was already a wait list, but the bar is accommodating and the meal was great, unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing . Very very authentic thai food especially the northern local . I had Duck Kao soii ($27.95)  is a must!!. the portion is huge . Thx u for being very generous. Jackfruit salad is the best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, it's almost impossible to make a reservation there because nobody answer the phone.
Secondly, the host/hostess are not friendly at all.
I understand one person is not that important since they have a lot of good reviews.  HOWEVER, one could be back to many reviews if you guys keep treating people badly. There is Archi's which is also Thai restaurant. Now I only go there since they have 3 locations in Las Vegas. They are friendly and treat even one person good enough."}
{"text":"The line can get ridiculous, but it's worth the wait.  This place is a bit different than your average Thai place, in that they serve both northern and southern Thai food.  Northern Thai is rare in the US, and it really shouldn't be. I had the Khao Soi, and it was delicious.

PS, I would not try walking here.  Either drive or take a cab."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to. It's about 10-15 min away from the strip. And it's in an old, creepy shopping center, but it's worth going to. All of the awards that you see when you walk into the restaurant are well deserved. This place kills it with their Thai food! And it's cheap....especially compared to what you'll pay eating on the strip!

The only thing I regret about our visit was ordering the Nam Prik Noom (Green Chile Dip) as an appetizer. My husband is obsessed with green chile which is why we ordered it. But we both didn't like it. I honestly am not sure why it is on the menu. The dish is cold. It was pretty much roasted green chilies, chopped up with onion, garlic and tomato. We ordered it spicy so I think they threw some thai chilies in there as well. And it was served with cut up vegetables and fried pork skin for dipping. It didn't taste good. I don't see how this dish is appetizing. I could have made this for myself at home. But why would anybody eat a slice of carrot or cucumber and dip it in green chili at a Thai restaurant? Just seemed random to me. I don't recommend ordering this.

However, for lunch my husband got the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle which was incredible!!! Best drunken noodle dish I've ever had. The portion size was big so I ended up eating half of his. The duck was crispy and served on top of pan fried flat rice noodles. The thai basil in the dish really made it flavorful! SO GOOD! Highly recommended!

I ordered the Kao Soi which is egg noodles in a red curry base and a touch of coconut cream. I chose beef for my meat choice and WOW this dish was so hearty, spicy, and flavorful! It tasted like thai comfort food. If you love curry and coconut this is the perfect dish. It was a nice change compared to the curry & rice that I usually eat since this dish comes with noodles. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat!

Overall, AMAZING spot and definitely worth coming to if you love authentic Thai cuisine! A lot of locals in Vegas recommended this place to us and it is a true gem."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST Thai restaurant I've ever been to. 

Please make sure you get yourself over here if you make it to Vegas and you love Thai food.

We had the beef salad, yellow curry, pot stickers, and tom kha gai. We also had a few ciders and some sake. IT WAS ALL DELICIOUS. Just so good. And a HUGE sake list. 

The restaurant itself was in a run down looking strip mall and once you are inside you can feel how long this place has been in business. They have photos on the wall of customers over the years. The place feels old and well loved.

The dining room was pretty large-two rooms I believe. We waited for our table at the bar and basically got our drinks when our table was ready. The service was friendly and fast and I really can't emphasize how good the food was.

It wasn't a fancy place, but you could certainly take a date here. 

My only complaint would be it was a little loud, but I find that to be true of so many restaurants these days :)"}
{"text":"his place is amazing! I was introduced to Lotus of Siam while viewing the Anthony Bourdain show \"Parts Unknown.\" Coincidentally my wife and I were traveling to Las Vegas just a few weeks after viewing the episode. Anthony's recommendations are alway on point, so we decided to eat at the restaurant during our visit. We were not disappointed, the food is excellent! They have a extensive menu and wine list. My wife went with the tradition Thai meal, and ordered from the Northern Thai menu. Either way you can't go wrong. The servers work diligently and are extremely knowledgeable when it pertains to the entree recommendations based on the customer's preferences. The restaurant is modest in size, and possesses a really nice ambience. Make your reservations the day before you plan on dining, the don't do same day RSVPs."}
{"text":"~$12 per person for the lunch buffet. This place is a little off the strip, and it is definitely worth it. The place does not face the main street, so you have to turn into a parking lot before you will see it. It is not the best Thai food, but it is a great deal for a good variety of food. The Thai tea was great. This is a place to go if you have been to the strip previously and want a cheap, filling meal."}
{"text":"Location: Quiet shopping plaza. Not very well lit. 

Ambiance: Very bright indoor lighting. Tables are tightly packed. Not kid friendly (-1 star). 

First impression: Hostess somewhat rudely looked at us and said, \"No reservations?\" It was 5:33pm on Thursday night. Three minutes after they opened. Didn't think it was that big of a deal but the hostess seemed annoyed at us (-1 star). 

Table Service: They have a very strange zone set up. The water boy for our table was excellent (+1 star). Very attentive. Never let our cups go dry. Our waiter, however, was spread too thin. We waited 18 minutes after being seated until he came over to greet us and take our order. At the end of our meal it took another 10 minutes from requesting our check until we got it (-1 star). 

Food: Tasty, but spicy. I like certain level of heat but their rating scale is higher than average. 

Summary: Overall decent meal with hit and miss service starting from the moment I walked into the restaurant. I may consider take out in the future since the food itself was pretty good, but I likely won't go back for another in person dining experience."}
{"text":"I would say food is good, service is good, I have had better Thai food but no complains here."}
{"text":"Ate there twice this week. Food is great!! What was disappointing was that the hostesses are not welcoming or friendly at all. Servers are ok. Great food, mediocre service. Staff seems burnt out. Kudos to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is really good and to die for but service are not good. Our server was rude. And don't even say hi but instead of say hi . He directly ask if we re ready to order"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas, and has received national recognition.  I know people that fly here just to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dump on the outside, but boy is it yummy on the inside!  For lunch, they have a mini buffet that has a decent selection (including fruit).  In no particular order, here's what we ordered (I apologize in advance for not having the proper names of things, but I just can't remember):

drunken noodles with fish (entree) - YUM.  The noodles were a bit greasy, but the fish was perfectly fried - lightly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside.  The flavors were also incredible, lots of basil goodness, for those who love that.

raw shrimp (appetizer) - yes, the shrimp was raw, but if you can get past that, this dish is definitely worth trying.  it comes with this really tasty dipping sauce that's spicy, but not in the ah ah flaming hot way, but the savory rich way.  You like spicy?  You like sour?  Try this dish!

raw steak tartare (appetizer) - the flavors in here were amazing.  the closest I can come to describing it is that it's a bit like the cold chinese beef five spice dish, with more thai flavors mixed in.  I know that that description is pretty much no description at all, but if you like spicy and you like meat, you should definitely give this a try.

scallops with mint chili sauce - oh god so good.  the scallops were cooked to perfection, and that sauce...well, I could drink it as soup with a side of rice.  It's not overwhelmingly minty, and also has a nice kick of cilantro to it.

tom yum soup - really really sour, with a hint of spice - we got the \"for two\" bowl (medium size), and shared with four people, which was really the perfect amount for an appetizer.  There were lots of big juicy prawns inside, and also some mushrooms and chili oil.

beef salad - our waiter recommended this to us, as one of the most popular dishes, and I can certainly see why.  This was probably my favorite (though ironically, I can't remember the thai name for it).  The beef was really tender (I think they marinated it or something beforehand), and it was served over a bed of lettuce with onions, lime juice, and a hint of ginger.  The dish was pretty saucy, though, so you'll definitely need some rice to eat with it.

This place is pretty pricey, especially anything with seafood in it, so be prepared to spend some dough.  My experience with Thai food up until this place was pretty much pad thai and basil chicken, so this place really opened up my eyes to just how incredible Thai food can be.  And if you're like me, and don't really like the coconut-y, peanut-y side of Thai food, rest assured that this place has plenty of other spicy/sour items for you to try if that's what floats your boat.  The menu is absolutely humongous, and if you go with a group, everyone should be able to find at least one item they'd like to eat."}
{"text":"Looking for Thai food in Vegas? Go to this place. Casual atmosphere but the food... excellent! My family and I ordered KOONG SARONG ( Prawn in a blanket ), TOM YUM KUNG (Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass & straw mushroom), NUA NAM TOK (Sliced charbroiled beef mixed with green onion, chili, lime juice & rice powder), SEA BASS SOM THUM (Sea Bass with Thai Papaya Salad), CRISPY DUCK with CHILI MINT LEAVES (Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil), YELLOW CURRY-The mildest among all Thai curries made from curry powder, turmeric and spice with coconut cream, potato and carrot, chicken, and PAD SW-EW (Stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce). They were all excellent. I was in Thai food heaven :o)"}
{"text":"It had been over a year since I visited Vegas (the horror!) so I had a long time to build up LOS in my mind as I anticipated my next trip. I heard great things about the restaurant from some local foodies, and hundreds of Yelp reviews echoed the same praise.

Our 30 minute wait went by quickly as we read all the articles about LOS in the lobby. We were hungry and overwhelmed by the menu, but our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions. He brought over the sommelier to help us find a wine that would go with our dishes. The Riesling was an absolute knockout and an astounding value at $38.

The waiter recommended the duck panang for my husband and drunken noodles with tofu for me. My husband was in love with his dish despite the fact that he usually is indifferent about duck. He said the crispy skin reminded him of cracklins, only better. I loved my drunken noodles too. The thick, wide rice noodles were drowning in a great brown sauce and topped with fried tofu and basil. We finished up with fried bananas and ice cream (the mango was unavailable). The server who brought it out instructed us on the best way to eat the dish, something I always appreciate.

It was a spectacular meal and lives up to the \"best Thai in the country\" reputation. We've been recommending LOS to all our friends with the gentle reminder to ignore the gay bathhouse in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. The raw shrimp appetizer and the crispy duck curry was extremely good."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook.

As a white person who really likes spicy food, I'm used to wait staff underestimating how spicy I really want my dishes.  I'm not saying anyone is racist or anything, just that most people don't believe that I actually like the spicy.  Usually, I order \"spicy\" and get \"mild,\" or I order \"medium\" and get \"no heat whatsoever.\"

The folks at Lotus of Siam are not playing with their 1-10 spice-o-meter.  When I asked for one of my dishes (Panang Curry with Tofu) to be a level 7, the waiter warned me that I'd be sweating.  Same goes for the Drunken Noodles, although the sweat warning came at 5.  

He was right.  It was FIERY.  And delicious.  So delicious.  My lips were burning for an hour afterward but I loved every minute of it.  

For those of you willing to go well off the strip to an unassuming restaurant that sort of resembles a mediocre spot in your suburban hometown, you will be rewarded with a great meal at an astoundingly low price (for Vegas).  I vow to return!"}
{"text":"I always come to Lotus of Siam when in Vegas. It's simply delicious! I've had the drunken noodles (very good), duck (yum), but my favorite is the Khao Soi with shrimp. It's magnificent!! It's a difficult dish to find in other Thai restaurants. The service is fast. I always make a reservation as soon as I book my hotel."}
{"text":"Offbeat location but excellent food. They have Northern Thai dishes which i haven't seen where i live.  Aside from ordering Larb, went with their recommendations for 4 N Thai dishes and they were all good.  Sticky rice with Mango to wrap up was quite good also.  I would definitely hunt this place down again and get away from the strip next time as well! The place was crowded (and is pretty good size)  the whole time we were there. Service is not exactly what you get used to though coming from somewhere like The Venetian on the strip."}
{"text":"I  come here any chance I can when I am in Vegas!!!!
You are supposed to get mostly northern Thai food but it is soooo spicy!

Everything is YUM  

Wait can get REALLY long at peak hours.  

Again so good but it is very spicy.  

Great for groups and they even have a sommelier."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and amazing food! If you really want to get a taste of what this restaurant is all about you must order from the northern section of the menu."}
{"text":"This is the spot! There is no better place for Northern Thai Cuisine within all of USA. You must book reservation in advance, or expect a long wait time (all nights of wk). Spot is truly a hidden jewel off Spring Mtn. & the crumbling outside does not match the well-kept interior. Has a phenomenal wine selection that is moderately priced, and is especially extensive in Rieslings and the area Alsace.

The whole menu is phenomenal (been 20+ times here & never had a bad dish). My favorite dishes include: The Khao Soi with any protein, The Drunken Noodles with Chilean Sea Bass, Panang Curry with Crispy Duck, the Crab Ragoons, the cashew nut chicken, the baby corn and the Pad Thai with chicken. Truly love taking new people here not only to experience the food but the wine list. Great to share the pairing of spicy food with the minerality/citrus notes of an Alsacean Riesling.

The staff is great & provides fast service always. The spice level on dishes ranges from low 1- high 10! I like it very very very spicy & 10 is true Thai spice! 

Will continue to frequently go back & bring new people along. Truly one of my top dining places!(now craving the khao soi)"}
{"text":"Smartest thing I've done in quite a while was ask the floor supervisor what she would order!  Started with Appetizer 14 Nam Kao Tod and followed from their Northern Menu with Item D. Thum Ka Noon.   Next time will definitely order the same and add the Garlic Prawns from the Chef's Choices.  Unbelievably fantastic food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Alright, I know 13715309 people have reviewed this place, but here's my 2 cents:

- The appetizers were by far the best part of the meal. 
- The tom kha was the BEST tom kha I've ever had, and that is the dish by which I judge every Thai restaurant (because it's my fav).
- The main dishes were a bit anticlimactic. The menu descriptions were far more exciting than the actual product - bland, with not very many ingredients (e.g. a dish that promised pineapple had literally 2 pieces of pineapple in it).

I have faith in their potential, though, so I wish I could give this place another go."}
{"text":"Make sure you have a reservation!  Worth a short can ride off the strip. Pad Thai was yum!"}
{"text":"Lotus has become a staple whenever we visit Las Vegas. I havent had a bad dish here. My favorite is the drunken noodles and crispy prawns."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a good price. The Pad Se Ew is delicious and we got 3 orders, some crab fried rice, and some appetizers. It was definitely worth it and I would recommend anyone go before they leave vegas"}
{"text":"I'm still licking my fingers at how good the food is at this place! No matter what you're into this restaurant will make your dreams come true! Traditional thai entrees to some with a twist that might surprise you how good they are! I not only like how unique and flavorful our meals were but, the vibrant colors are really cool. The place is very clean considering the people traffic. Portion size was fair for the reasonable pricing. They also have a parking lot for those driving vs ubering. It was a nice getaway from the strip! This is my second time around and I look forward to coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot better. Sadness. 

Pad See Ew (2.5 stars) Pretty bland, not much flavor. Got a level 3 spicy and it was a good amount if you're a mid to low spice person.

Drunken noodles (2.5 stars): More flavor than pad see ew, but again nothing too great.

Garlic Prawns (4 stars): This was good, but pretty pricey. Garlic-y and crispy. 

Crispy Duck with Panang Curry (4 stars): They don't give you much duck but it was good and the panang was good too.

Green curry (2 stars): Tasted very bland. Do not get this. 

I guess only a few things here are worth having. I wouldn't get the regular Thai food items because those are definitely not flavorful here. 

We had a birthday and asked the guy if they do anything. He said he could bring out ice cream with a candle which was nice (= 

SERVICE (3.5 Stars)
Pretty good service for a busy restaurant. At first we only got like 5 menus for a group on 12...weird. I don't think the have enough for the restaurant. They brought out all the food at the same time, and kept refilling the rice when we asked. 

ATMOSPHERE (4 stars)
Really big, tables are spaced out so you don't feel crowded. There are all these pics up of celebrities who came to the restaurant, but I didn't know more than half of them, haha. Waiting area in the front is crowded, and when you're done you feel the glare from the people waiting as you walk by hoping they get your table. The plaza it's in doesn't look like anything fancy. You wonder how this place can charge $23 for some dishes in this location, haha. There are taxis coming up dropping people off to try this place. I think it's just really hyped up. If it's supposed to be good thai food then the regular Thai dishes should have flavor too!"}
{"text":"After watching Food Paradise and seeing how amazing their Khao Soi looks on Tv I knew I had to try this place. Came around 6 and the wait was about 45mins. Since we were all super hungry we decided to sit at the bar and order instead of waiting for a table. We got Khao Soi, Spicy chicken wings, chicken larb, crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli, and Garlic Prawns. The larb was amazing. That was my favorite dish. The Khao Soi sucks!! The broth was warm and the presentation of the dish did not look like the one on TV. It was missing pickles and the crispy noodle. The spicy chicken was just okay. I've tasted better. Garlic Prawns was also average. For 30 dollars it wasn't worth it. It just deep fried shrimp with some garlic in it. I will not return to this place. I've tasted way better Thai's food in the Bay Area and Portland."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Great place for vegetarians. One of few Thai places we loved. Definitely we will be back here."}
{"text":"This is touted as one of the top Thai restaurants in the country and the food is nice.  I knocked it down two stars because the flavor has been knocked down to fit farang palates and the service is stoic and unfriendly.  I know it's meant to highlight northern Thai cuisine and having lived in northern Thailand for a number of years it's still sadly a facsimile at best of the real thing.  The khao soi i ate in Thailand was far less refined, much more rustic, and much more flavorful.  The asian restaurants I appreciate are the ones that aren't there for farang, but rather there to feed the ethnicity to which the food claims to represent."}
{"text":"A friend recommended coming to this place, and I'm so glad I did! Very good Thai food, and great portions, too. This place is huge, and I can see why. The place immediately became packed as soon as it opened. We had their Thai Tea, the Tom Yum Plar Dook (Tom Yum with catfish), Shrimp Pad Thai, and the highly recommended Garlic Chili Prawns. The Prawns are a $22 dish, but soo worth it. They were huge and full of flavor! All of our dishes had just the right amount of sweet, sour, and spice. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The Four Kegs Bar this Las Vegas Bar used to be the place to go for good cold beer and watch sporting events and get good food back when I moved here in 1985.  We went there yesterday, the neighborhood has aged and a lot of shops have left the area but 4 Kegs remains and the food and beer are as good as it was 30 years ago.

The stromboli's are to die for, my favorite the cajun fries oh yeah lets not forget the pizza.

A must for those who want real Vegas without all the glitter and high prices."}
{"text":"Could go on and on .... And on. Treat yourself and put yourself and trust let your server pick your meal - follow their recommendations and get ready for a spectacular dining experience.  I can't even remember the names of our dishes but all were: wow!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and all three (3) visits were a let-down. The food is marginal as I have found much better Thai food in other locations in town. Marnee Thai was better back in the day, and the Thai Noodle House and Archie's are much better. Additionally, the service here has lacked a great deal upon every visit. \"Busy\" does not necessarily translate into \"quality\". Would never return."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.

You cannot come to Vegas without visiting Lotus of Siam. You would be missing out on the best meal of your life! 

My Dad and I decided to stop by after a friend recommended it to us, and it was honestly the BEST Thai food either of us had ever had. And we've had A LOT of Thai food in our lives. It was so good that we ended up coming back two days later for more!

We tried the fried prawns, fresh spring rolls (not on the menu, but definitely worth ordering!), fried chicken wings, shrimp pad thai, crispy duck with drunken noodles, and soft shell crab with drunken noodles, and everything was EXCEPTIONAL. I'm practically drooling right now just thinking about it. I can't wait to go back! 

This restaurant is an absolutely CAN'T MISS stop if you're visiting Vegas. I couldn't recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"I am Thai, and I gotta say this is the best that food I have ever had (sorry Mom)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The Penang chicken is to die for and the coconut ice cream with sticky rice is heaven. HOWEVER..... our service was not all that great. Our waitress was Ploy and our hostess told us to order everything we wanted all at once, as they were closing the kitchen soon. So we put in our order with our dessert and the waitress told us to hold off seeing that we ordered \"so much\" food. I found it to be a little rude that she was trying to make an assumption on what we should order when we were told to order our food all at once. After we ordered we didn't see our waitress. She did not come back to check on the food or how we were doing. The other servers were picking up her slack. Then we had to hunt her down just to get our check. And we told her we were in a bit of a hurry and she still had us waiting for a while.... I will gladly come back but I hope our service is much better."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing! We got a couple dishes, including their very popular Crispy Duck Panang Curry..I'm sure everything on their menu tastes fantastic! We went for lunch during the week and there was no wait. It does get crowded in the evening, but you can always make reservations ahead of time.  Don't forget about Lotus of Siam when you visit Vegas. You'll be very happy you did!"}
{"text":"Excellent offerings. We left another place and thankfully landed here. Best Thai food  I've ever had the chance to experience. We will be back again. Rather than wait, we sat in the comfy couches in the bar area. Very cozy and no wait. Highly recommend over some of the other places in town."}
{"text":"Located off strip so you'll need to drive or take a taxi.  It doesn't look fancy from the outside but the inside is what counts.  ;-)

If going for dinner, I recommend calling and making a reservation at least a day in advance.  It was extremely busy when we went, but luckily we had a reservation.  The staff were all very friendly and provided excellent service.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  Very high quality Thai food!  

We ordered the panang curry with beef.  We only asked for mild spiciness and it was a bit spicy for me, just a warning if you're sensitive to spiciness. It was still delicious though and the spiciness did not bother me too much.  

Also ordered the Nua Nam Tok which is sliced charbroiled beef mixed with green onions, chili, lime juice & rice powder.  It also had cilantro which was not listed on the menu.  It was AMAZING!!!  Loved it!

Lastly, we ordered the chow mein with pork.  Very delicious as well!!!

Hands down, the best Thai food I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we've gone to Lotus of Siam we laugh at the surroundings because it's in a huge dead strip mall in Vegas. That being said it is one of the places to go in if you're in the city.

I've heard Lotus of Siam being dubbed the best Thai restaurant in the entire west coast. I wouldn't got that far but it is delicious. You have your usual dishes like Pad Thair or Pad Sew Ew but what you really want to check out is the northern dishes on the last couple pages. These are regional Thai plates that you don't usually see in the U.S. 

We tried the Yellow Curry with Chicken, Chicken Satay, Red Curry with Chicken, and Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow. Chicken Satay is pieces of chicken cooked on skewers with a yellow sauce, while the Kha Nom Jean Nam Kgyow is a noodle dish with ground pork in a red soupy sauce. We finished with the fried bananas and Coconut Ice Cream. Everything was great and we wold gladly go back again."}
{"text":"You can't beat the quality of food. But The service is choppy. Busy servers who forget to bring food or check on you.."}
{"text":"This is a legendary place and totally meets and even exceeds expectations, I have eaten here approx. 15 times and every time has been excellent. The Chef's Choice Braised Short Ribs with Panang is incredible and a must! SAI OUA [Northern Style Sausage] off of the Northern Menu Sausage is also a must, Everything is great but I would recommend ordering off the Northern Menu (Khao Soi is a great dish) and Chef's Choice menus as much as possible. And the servers are great at helping with ordering more unique dishes, if Anthony is there try and get him. Definitely make reservations. They also have an excellent wine list and the servers are great at helping with that."}
{"text":"Amazing all around. We made reservations 2 months in advanced and now I know why it was so important. This place was packed so be prepared, but they seated us quickly, brought our drinks and food quickly and we all left with a smile. We ordered 13 entrees and all shares Bc we've just heard such great things. The coconut curry with crispy duck, garlic sea bass, pad Thai, green curry, beef and coconut peanut sauce, garlic prawns, soft shell crab drunken noodle and pineapple fried rice were just a few I could remember and it was all phenomenal. Looking forward to coming back here and sharing the experience with whoever I'm with!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Friendly staff, great atmosphere.  Really lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Oh man their food is good! The front door is in the back so it can be hard to find at a first glance but people go here for a reason!"}
{"text":"Funny story about this place... as discerning yelpers know, it's a bit off the strip, somewhat near the convention center, in a run down strip mall; don't let that steer you away, though.  When we got dropped off around 1:30 for a late lunch, the cabbie advised us to just have the restaurant call for a cab when we were done.  

Thinking nothing of it, I approached the counter and asked them to call for a cab when our bill came.  We were told there was a cabbie strike in progress in vegas, and the wait times could be 30-60 minutes.  So, we went outside, and sure enough, ended up waiting 30-40 minutes, and still no cab.

Since we had eaten a late lunch, so the restaurant had closed to prepare for the dinner rush at this point, and out trots Saipin Chutima, along with her son and daughter.  We were standing with another couple who had been waiting nearly as long as we were, and all four of us recognized the owner and head chef from her appearance in the most recent season of Top Chef Masters.  They walked over to a pair of cars, and pulled them around in front of the restaurant.

Saipin's daughter Pennapa introduced herself, and apologized for the lengthy delay of our cabs.  They then proceeded to offer us rides to the Las Vegas Hilton, which is the closest major resort to the shop, so that we could arrange quick transport to our final destinations, rather than wait here with uncertainty.  Needless to say, we all accepted.

The other couple went off with Saipin's son, while my wife and I got to ride with Saipin and her daughter, who drove.  They were both extremely pleasant, with Pennapa making small talk about our trip and lamenting the service they've been getting from the cabbies due to the strike.  They asked about our meal, and what we had liked and disliked.

Once we got dropped off at LVH, we waved goodbye, and stood next to the same couple again laughing and wondering what had just happened.  Say what you will about the location and decor of Lotus of Siam; you will never in your life find better service than what we received there.  

Oh, right.  The food.  That's easy... simply the best Thai I have ever eaten.  No question.

We had Nam Prik Ong, which I had never had before, but will now actively search for.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Sticky rice is a must with this dish.  We also had an order of drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  My wife and I agreed that it was the best we'd ever had.  Of course, we also had some Pad Thai.  Also the best we've ever eaten.

Give this place your patronage at all costs; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ming Tsai was on a episode of the best thing I Ever Ate, on Food Network, so we tried this place, from the outside and neighborhood at night you think \"NO WAY\" risk it this place is GREAT! and it is huge inside looks throw you way off on this one.  Plus  Chef Tsai was right the Nam Prik Ong was fantastic!!  The wine list in this place is hands down impressive as well.  The service top notch, and prices were great as well, I feel sorry for the folks that pass this place up based on the looks from the outside."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai I've had the pleasure of eating."}
{"text":"This establishment would have received five stars if it were based soley on the food. The prices are very overpriced. It may be because it is known as one the best Thai places around. The garlic prawns are a must. You can eat the whole thing including the shell. They are crispy and delicious. The panang curry has just the right amount of spices and heat. It is great with the crispy duck. The papaya salad is sweet and goes well with any of the other dishes, especially the spicy ones."}
{"text":"After extensive research, I retained Zach Parry to resolve a securities fraud case filed with the largest securities dispute resolution forum in the United States.  The case was first initiated on my own and I took it as far as I could go without legal help given that the opposing party had at attorney who was an expert in securities arbitration. 
 
Zach came to the rescue; he had a terrific educational background with a BS from Brigham Young University and a law degree from the University of Illinois.  He also had broad legal skills including handling cases in fraud litigation and arbitration.  I was very pleased how quickly he got up to speed on my case.  His case filings were excellent in representing my case and the respondents realized the best strategy was to settle the case.  Through direct negotiations he again legally supported my side on many issues and through his strong negotiating, Mr. Parry received the highest settlement I could have expected to receive.  During the process he was easy to work with always seeking my input and educating me on my options.  I highly recommend Zach Parry; he is a multi-skilled attorney as he so well demonstrated on my case."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Mmmmmmmm good.

I read about Lotus of Siam on Yelp before we went and had noted some of the favourite dishes.  We ordered the CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. - 20.95 (under \"Chefs Choice\") and drunken noodle with sea bass which the table beside us was enjoying.  

We also ordered a spicy rice dish and it was SPICY!!!  The food was incredible and even the wine recommendation was great.  Their wine selection is extensive but I think the wine is really kept in a cellar - our red wine was very very cool.  It was not a cheap meal for Thai food but was a great price for an incredible meal.

The place does look sketchy from the outside and is apparently not in a great neighbourhood but it was $15 in a cab from The Wynn.  We asked them to call a cab for us when we were ready to leave so we didn't have to wait outside.  

I would definitely recommend Lotus of Siam.  Bring your friends, try something different, maybe even something a bit spicy.  You won't regret it.  And if you have tried Thai food before you will not be disappointed - I promise."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Vegas.  This place is pretty good but I'm not sure if it's worth the cab fare from the strip to and fro.  But my friends always seem to want at least one meal here.

It is a nice break from the hotels and buffets on the strip.  If you ask for the food to be spicy, they will make it spicy...no joke.

i've had most of the dishes on the menu and I think their special shrimp dish is probably best.  It's like a small piece of shrimp that is fried with bacon."}
{"text":"The waiter should warn customers about the spicy level of their food!!!! I'm a spicy lover and ordered 7/10 level, it Turned out to be ridiculously hooooot.
Ordered tom yum soup and Pinang curry, it was authentic BUT way too spicy. 

Thai ice tea was amazing and I had 2 glasses. But because of the spiciness and cold drink mixture, I threw out 10 min after having food :("}
{"text":"After a long drive from LA to Vegas I was ready to hit up Lotus of Siam. No buffets for me..they all taste the same. 

My girlfriend was a bit skeptical due to its location on an old strip mall. LOL.

As soon as we enter she was impressed with the see through wine cellar and pictures of celebrities and Iron chef Bobby Flay. I also mention the owner/chef Saipin Chutima was a James Beard Award winning chef. WIth that in mind our expectaction of her Northern style food was high.

We ordered Drunken noodle with seabass and Prawn.  

Drunken Noodle with seabass gets 4 1/2 stars. The noodle (4stars)  was good, but i was expecting something speciall. On the other hand the Seabass was 5 stars. It was crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth fresh in the middle. WOW it was soo good. 

Prawn (5 Stars)  This is something special that you don't find anywhere else. Its skin was split away from its meat. Which both were cooked in perfection. I took a bite of the meat first and then ate the skin which were so soft and crunchy. Its texture mirrors a crispy potato chip. This was a perfect dish!! 

There many good Thai restaurants here in LA. I have never taste anything as good as Lotus' Seabass and Prawn here in LA."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Thai food and this is definitely one of the best. And for as much Thai food as I eat, Lotus still had a selection of Thai dishes I had never seen before.

I went with a large group and we ate family style. We got a number of the normal Thai dishes - panang curry, pad see ewe, pad thai, etc. They were all great with one odd exception. No one in the group was a fan of the pad thai. There was something different about it, the color was much darker almost as if they had added some sort of tomato paste (guessing). But everything else was fantastic.

The highlight for me was the thai dishes I had never seen before. There was a short rib in some very spicy orange sauce (forget the name exactly) which was absolutely superb and I will get it EVERY time I return. It is simply fantastic. We also had a unique seabass dish which was good on its own, but great with some other spicy sauce that was served with the dish. 

I would highly, highly recommed Lotus of Siam as the best off-the-strip restaurant I've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to eating here. With all the accolades was expecting authentic delicious food. I should of known better when seeing all the celebrity pictures on the wall. 
I've lived in Thailand, learned how to cook from grandmothers and professionals cooks. The food here is watered down sweet interpretation of Thai food. Great job in marketing poor job on taste!"}
{"text":"What a joke! All hype no substance! Ordered drunken noodles, garlic and pepper chicken wings, nom prik ohm, and a style of hot and sour soup. We ordered to go and live about 4 miles away we went straight home and started serving. Everything was either mostly cold or luke warm. Absolutely no flavor in anything especially the dish that put this place on the map! How is it possible that chili paste has no flavor? I've eaten Thai food all over town and this is by far the worst of the bunch. I'll usually order a combination of American Thai as well as \" authentic.\" I just happened to be in area to eat at Cornish pasty co, they were closed and thought next best option would be to try the famous a Lotus of Siam. Big mistake! I've had more flavorful food from 24 hr Thai delivery. The portions are small, and overpriced. TRUST ME! Do not waste your time or money, you can probably pick any other Thai restaurant in town and have better food. By the way as I'm writing this my heart is pounding and I'm getting more and more thirsty. Can only mean copious amounts of MSG!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Bad attitute .. Wait so long. We came at 4 pm to wait 5:30 pm. The owner ia cold  face. Bring all her friends coming. Never come again.."}
{"text":"I think maybe it was too hyped up for me. I mean, people driving hundreds of miles just to eat here? Not buying it. Overall, the food was very good but it didn't really knock my socks off or anything. Though I sometimes wonder if Thai food can ever knock my socks off. 

We went on a Monday at about 7 pm and there was no wait at all. The restaurant is in a questionable appearing strip mall with plentiful parking. The inside of the restaurant is deceptively huge. 

Our waitress was very nice and informative. When we asked for recommendations, she knew her stuff and was ready with some excellent options immediately. The medium spicy was actually a little on the spicier side which makes me shudder to think of what their spicy is....

I do, however, highly recommend the Panang short ribs. Less impressed by the garlic prawns. The tom kha gai soup was good but not the best."}
{"text":"Super pricey! Ridiculously small serving portions!

My friends raved about this place so we had to check it out.  It is a big place but it gets packed.  So, make reservation.

We ordered the special crispy duck with panang curry sauce, Thai fried rice, chilli mint catfish, ground pork, chicken curry, and stuffed chicken wings.

The crispy duck is really really delicious! It is a must try! We did pay $20+ for 6/7 small slices of duck meat tho. 

The spicy chilli catfish was just ok.  It cost us $15 for literally 5/6 small pieces of fish.  The chilli mint ground pork tasted good but the serving portion was so small that we were almost upset.  Seriously, ground pork costs nothing.  Fried rice was good but nothing special.

We did have the sticky rice and mango dessert.  It is to die for.

Overall, food is decent but prices are not acceptable for Thai food.  I would suggest you go for the Chef's specials such as the crispy duck and beef stew.  They are all over $20 a dish but at least they are special.  Don't order the typical Thai food that you can get it somewhere else at a much cheaper price.

We probably won't go back because all we really did was loading up on steam rice so we didn't have to leave hungry."}
{"text":"I actually ate here a long time ago, first time I actually ate here. My sister and her boy friend asked us to go to dinner there. Ordered many dishes, everything we ordered was excellent. Very authentic! Heat level and portions were very good. They are very busy.... Outside looks small but when you go inside its a good size inside.  They have a big wine room! Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"To this Texas girl, Lotus of Siam is some dayum good Thai food.  I can't group myself in with the connoiseurs and aficionados but I do love to eat it!  We came in for a late lunch right before our flight out, so we had all our luggage with us and it wasn't an issue.  The cabbie that brought us here had never heard of the place, but the one that took us to the airport was all excited we had heard about it because he loves it too.

Anyhoo--

- Thai Iced Tea, get it.  
- Crispy garlic prawns, I wasn't the hugest fan (I was a little more squeamish about the shells) but my dude loved them
- We wanted to order the snapper or sea bass (i forget which now) on the drunken noodles, but they were out, so we got the duck.  Very similar to pad kee mow with basil, tomato, peppers---soooo good
- Tom Kha Gai soup - VERY tangy but good.  A little on the salty side.
- Mango sticky rice - I've never really liked this in the past but holy mother of god I'm now a convert.  SOOO glad we were there during mango season!!!  Now I gotta find this in Dallas...

For a casual Thai-enthusiast, I'd definitely recommend checking it out!! We'll definitely make it a staple for future visits."}
{"text":"Best Thai food we ever had. The Pad se ew, Seafood soup, Thai tea are great. My husband loves the Crispy Duck. Go to place for all Thai food. Nowhere else compares!"}
{"text":"Didn't like anything.  Yeah, I said it.  I  didn't enjoy Lotus of Siam.  After all of the hype I was really disappointed with this place.  I didn't like the food and can't believe people actually wait in line for this place.  

I can appreciate an \"Old School Gem\" but this place is just old. What a dump!  This hole in wall is in a terrible area of town too.

Not a fan and will never return.  

My taste buds deserve better~"}
{"text":"Please don't leave Vegas without making a pit stop to this amazing Thai restaurant. It's about 10 minutes off the strip but 100% worth it!!! 

The Pad Thai alone honestly blows me away every time. While the noodles are thinner, the sweet and tangy flavors blend together seamlessly with a spicy kick if you add their chili sauces (which you should). Truthfully, the servings aren't the biggest but the taste most definitely makes up for it. 

The fried rice and tom yum soup are also amazing. But for starters, you can't go wrong with the pad Thai. 

TIP: They close for lunch/dinner (linner?) break at 2:30 and reopen at 5 pm.

SIDE NOTE: So many famous people have eaten here before! Nicolas Cage, past and present politicians etc. Check out their wall of fame when you stop by."}
{"text":"My son suggested we try this Thai restaurant in Las Vegas because he had read it was the best Thai restaurant in the United States.   I've never been a big fan of Thai cooking but I went along for the ride.  Since I've had limited experience, I'm in no place to judge how it ranks in the whole country but it now has my vote, for sure.

Everything we had was wonderful.  Service was superb.  We couldn't believe how fast the food was served after we ordered.  We started with the fried jerky with a spicy sauce which I understood was a Northern Thai dish.  It was an interesting, unusual and tasty appetizer unlike anything we had ever eaten before.

My son had the crispy duck panang in a spicy cream sauce.  The waiter asked for his spicy preference on a scale of 1 to 10.  My son said 6, I said mild which the waiter translated as 2 and we both said our dishes were perfect.  I've never been a fan of duck but I tried a bite and it was very good.   The steamed vegetables he ordered as a side were picture perfect.

I was tempted to try the whole smoked catfish but decided to start with something a little less ambitious.  I ordered the pan fried smoked catfish prepared with vegetables and a curry sauce.   Where I come from we eat a lot of catfish and this was one of the most delicious and unusual catfish dishes I have ever eaten.   This is a restaurant where you should step out of your comfort zone and you may be very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Our group of five had the most delicious dinner!  We ordered Five appetizers and five entrées, which we all shared. H dish that had the table I think was better than the last, we had excellent, friendly service, and had a delicious dinner and a great time."}
{"text":"The best musaman curry in the in the country. I have had a lots of them.this is the best."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their crispy duck is out of this world! It comes with this special curry.. very delish! 

The location is inside a random plaza downtown, and it was a bit sketch at night because there was this homeless dude walking around. I think it was only sketch because I had me gf with me at the time and she felt a bit scared.. Not me, though! Haha.

We also had the fried prawns, and they're smart in including the shell of the prawn so they can justify the price :) but it was well worth it!

Reservations are definitely recommended, and come on time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Vegas. Nothing even comes close. The Nam Kao Tod (crispy fried rice) is a MUST ORDER. I consistently love the papaya salad. The curries are all fantastic. Even the basics here are amazing. I love to come in for the pad Thai and pad see ewe. 

Be careful though, the spice level is pretty high here. Order the spice level significantly below where you would typically order. They are hot."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this place, Its a great atmosphere, great food, and I've always had outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I have dined at LoS twice now during my Las Vegas trip.  Both times the food, the service and the environment are as outstanding as my first visit many years ago when they just opened their doors.   The TOM KAH KAI remains one of my favorites with the wonderful blend so many flavors.   The SEABASS SOM THUM, makes an awesome gluten-free option!  We topped the dinner off with the delicate Mango Sticky Rice which is awesome when in season.  Reservations are needed as they book quickly, especially during peak dining times."}
{"text":"Expect LONG lines. Come when the first open to be seated right away. This place gets packed, but luckily it's huge inside.

Ordered the garlic prawns $28, for about 8 large prawns, delicious!! Kinda pricey but delicious.

Also got the pad see ew, drunken noodles with seafood, and papaya salad. You can choose a spiciness level 1-10. We chose 5 and it was super spicy!! 

Each entree is around  $10. Pretty good service too for a busy restaurant. 

I thought the entrees were okay, the garlic prawns was the best!"}
{"text":"While not your cheap Thai takeout spot, this place is worth a stop pretty much every time you're in Vegas.  Get the garlic prawns and the crispy duck khao soi and then experiment with some of the other dishes, and you won't regret your choice.  Make sure you get a reservation as early as you can cause even though it's in a rundown strip mall, it's a really popular place."}
{"text":"There are plenty of reviews of Lotus of Siam, thanks to consistent buzz amongst locals, tourists, and food magazines. Know going in that you can't just waltz in, pick something off the menu and expect to be stunned. Their menu is extensive and contains most of the standard Thai dishes, most of which are pretty average. But if you know what to order you can have an amazing experience. They feature a lot of Northern Thai dishes which are unique to most Westerners, many of which are pretty mind-blowing. When in doubt, ask your waiter -- the staff knows what's popular. I've been here around 20 times in the past year, and here are my favorites, more or less in order of awesomeness:

1) Spicy chicken wings (appetizer)
2) Special crispy duck curry with Panang sauce
3) Drunken noodles with Sea Bass
4) Fish cakes (appetizer)
5) Crying Tiger Beef (basically just tender grilled beef steak with a good sauce)
6) Thai beef jerky (appetizer)

Stick with those, especially the first 4, and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"My brother's Thai friends recommended that I try Lotus of Siam because they said it was one of the best outside of their motherland. And you know what? It's not just them that recommend this place because famous chefs such as Jonathan Gold and Susan Feniger rave about this place as well. It's no wonder that they have been nominated for the James Beard award again and again. Just remember though that because this place is so good, you may want to call ahead and make a reservation unless you want to wait 45 minutes to an hour. 

Despite the swanky acclaim, let me warn you that the restaurant is way off the Strip and from the outside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. In fact, Lotus of Siam is in the original Asian enclave of Las Vegas off of East Sahara Avenue near downtown so don't expect it to be glittery nice like the new Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road. Regardless, I like being in this rundown part of town because it reminds me of the old Las Vegas before all the dazzling excess when the best hotel in town was the Dunes.  

Lotus of Siam is a Thai restaurant, but its real specialty is Isan-style food. Isan is a region of Thailand that is located in the northeast portion of the country and is bordered by Cambodia and Laos. If only I had known when I was in Thailand because Isan-style cuisine is fucking delicious! 

Unlike traditional Thai food that people are probably accustomed to which is more sour and sweet, Isan-style cooking is more garlicky and spicy. The only way to describe the uniqueness of Isan-style Thai food is to compare it to the Peranakan \"nyonya\" cuisine  of Malaysia/Singapore due to its blending of traditional Thai flavors with Cambodian and Laotian influences and to the Korean food from Cholla Province, due to its spicier and more pungent flavors.

So on Christmas Eve, our party of four ordered five dishes because the portions are a bit smaller than your normal Thai restaurant. We ended up ordering the standard noodle dishes of chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew as well as a really tangy papaya salad. I literally wanted to drink the papaya salad marinade because it was so fucking good. For the proteins we ordered moo yang (marinated charbroiled pork) and nua yum katiem (charbroiled beef marinated with garlic and hot sauce that is served on top of Thai cole claw). 

All the dishes were tasty, but my favorite was the Isan-style nua yum katiem. The beef had just the right amount of spicy flavors and mixed with the cole slaw, the combination was so good that I ended up drowning my rice in the sauce. 

At the end of the day, Lotus of Siam shines because it offers Isan-style Thai food. If you come here ordering just the normal Thai dishes, you may not enjoy this place for what it truly is. I will definitely will be returning. Sâep lai lai!"}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall literally, and in a kind of  shady location, but the Food tastes awesome!! They have a gigantic menu with food from different regions. It's a bit pricey and it was packed when I went on a weekday evening. We waited a little while for our food and was a little underwhelmed with the portion size. The food was delectable though."}
{"text":"Don't mind the ghetto surroundings, you'll soon discover that this is a hidden gem.  You must try the musaman curry, it is out of this world delicious.  The interior is surprisingly spacious and it was packed within minutes of lunch time.  Waiter was also an absolute gentleman and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"So what do you do when you just got slaughtered on YELP Nov OTM calls?  Why head out to Vegas and try to win it all back of course.  Well I wasn't so much a winner on the $$ front, but I win win on the crispy duck penang here at Lotus of Siam.
This is a seriously hyped up place and honestly, I have no idea what was ordered since someone in our party did the ordering.  Nothing really stood out, just good Thai food, but oh I do remember the penang and will definitely come here again on my next Vegas trip...or maybe just to get my \"windshield cleaned\" by the toothless cart lady that rolls in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I made reservations for LOS long before arriving in Vegas for my first ever visit after hearing so much about it on the chowhound message board.
I became sketched out when both the employees at the Palazzo and my cabbie had never heard of the place and I had to give directions.  The next thing I know, we're off the strip and getting dropped off at what appeared to be a run-down strip mall.  Queue the dirty look from the girlfriend.
I was somewhat relieved once inside LOS, although wasn't sure what to expect given that there wasn't anything too special about what was inside.
Anyway, all that really matters is that the food is amazing.  I eat a lot of Thai food and generally find it hard for a restaurant to do it really poorly or really well, and LOS managed to impress me.  Her specialty is Northern Thai dishes, so be sure to try something you may not be accustomed to if you're used to Bangkok Thai food, like I am.  The best part of all is that the food is incredibly reasonably priced.
Also the first thai restaurant I've been to with a wine list (though small)!
Be sure to check out the pictures on the wall of all the celebrities that have been patrons (including many famous chefs)!
As mentioned in the other reviews, reservations are key.  This place is often booked up days in advance.
I give it 5 stars for terrific value, superb Thai cuisine, and for being a refreshing break from the over-the-top glitz (and price) of the strip."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was already off the strip so I thought I'd give this place a shot.

This place is in a random mall with a bunch of vacant stores and you could hardly tell that this place was actually open. When I first came inside though, I was surprised to find a lot of people inside with a lot of families coming here to eat. Looks like a lot of locals come out to this place to enjoy lunch or dinner. 

Ordered the Nam Kao Tod, which was highly recommended by fellow yelpers. It came out pretty quickly and is very comparable to Thai Larp Salad but with a crispy texture with the crispy rice. It came spicy but not overly spicy and all the flavors mixed well with the crispiness of the rice. Also I ordered a bowl of Tom Kha soup which was very fresh and flavorful. 

Overall, I had a great lunch here and I'd definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times.
EXCELLENT Thai Food.  I have been to Thailand three times, and this food is just wonderful.  The strip mall is a dive, but it's certainly a hidden gem.  

I loved my red curry. The chicken satay was great. My friend ordered the seafood fried rice, which wasn't my favorite, but he liked it.  A couple of Singha beers and Bob's your uncle."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a while... It's off strip so a little harder to get to. 

It's good Thai food... Definitely above average. Ordered a few dishes that I hadn't before (can't remember the names) and for the most part enjoyed them. 

The one exception was the shrimp salad which was literally drenched in sauce... To the extent that it was almost inedible. So if you get salad I recommend asking for sauce on the side. 

No wait when we visited on a weekday lunchtime."}
{"text":"What a nice place , amazing food ! Im giving you guys 5 star for everything
I dont know what was salad name , but it was so great"}
{"text":"We went on a Sat. night and there was no line, maybe we were lucky, or off season.  So don't be put off by fears of a line.

I have to suggest not going any higher than 8/10 on the spice level with the red -face- curry.  Next time I will \"wimp out\" and stick with a 5/10 after scaring people with my red flushed face.  

Coconut ice cream on sticky rice, amazing."}
{"text":"Its also about the wine list!

Together the food and wines are a match made in heaven.

Second time dining at this exemplary Thai restaurant. If you order right, its insanely authentic. Ordered hot at level 8: dry chicken wings, soft shell crab drunken noodles, raw shrimp with insane dips, braised short ribs in a curry. 

The Headline is GERMAN WINES!
Rare is the place that has a decent German wine selection. Here in a North Vegas strip mall lies a true treasure trove. From super dry GGs all the way through TBAs.  Rieslings from all regions, vintages and prices. Page after page of a list that puts pretty much all others to shame. Perfect provenance as demonstrated by the huge glass cellar for available wines. (Undoubtedly there is an offsite too). 
Mark-up on the wines is surprisingly soft considering.

And if you don't know what wine to go with, no worries. The Somm is totally relaxed and helpful. Most people are intimidated by German labels, the only label more confusing than Burgundy, so the Somm will take the time to walk you to your bottle.

So drag yourself off the strip and enjoy a rare experience of the sublime and surreal, locals and smart visitors alike. Those who know go. Again and again."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Thai food I've had.   Huge strip mall with some other restaurants and bars - inside it's big and decent looking and clean.   Staff helpful.  And their seasoning of food is as Thai food used to be but can't get these days it seems.   It was our first time - we will be back often."}
{"text":"If you don't walk out of this restaurant thinking, \"That was some of the best Thai food I've ever had,\" then you've probably ordered the wrong items from the menu.  I mean, there are not really \"wrong items\" but if you came here for their chicken pad thai, then you might be wondering what all the hype is about.  Yes it's good pad thai, but you really have to try their specialties to understand why they have earned such a reputation. So with that said, here are my preferences on what I order when I go to Lotus of Siam.

Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip)
Sai Oua (Northern Sausage)
Garlic Prawns

Crispy Duck with Panang
Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab

If none of these sound appealing to you, I suggest that you order from the \"Northern\" or \"Chef's Choice\" sections on the menu because that's what they're really known for.

Lastly, don't forget to make reservations. No one really wants to wait outside for 2 hours in the less touristy part of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that there are three great Thai restaurants right now: Jitlada (Hollywood), Pok Pok (Portland), and Lotus of Siam (Vegas).  In Fall 2011, Mr R and I set out to try all three.  We lovingly referred to it as our Thai Trifecta, or Thai-fecta, if you will. 

We completed the Thai-fecta in December by visiting Lotus of Siam. 

The place is huge but cleaner and nicer than its strip mall implies. We arrived on a Saturday night at about 8:45 and we were seated after a 5 minute wait.

We had already studied the menu and knew what we'd order:

Nam Kao Tod - it was exactly as I imagined, but still not my favorite dish.  The lime in some Thai foods is not my favorite and this was a spicy, crunchy rice (not like fried rice, but more like a rice krispie) with sour sausage, onions, spice...and lots of lime.  It was pretty spicy so I ate it with cucumbers.

Spicy Drunken Noodles with Prawns - I love drunken noodles and these were pretty good. The prawns were huge and meaty - they still had the shells and little baby legs on them.  I confirmed a few times, \"we eat the shell, right?\" and they said yes. So I did. I could manage the shell but the legs freaked me out a bit.

Nam Prick Ong - Mr R loved this and I liked it a lot. Its spicy ground pork with red chiles that you scoop onto vegetables, pork rinds, or sticky rice.  We ordered the sticky rice just to keep our options open, but I really enjoyed it with the carrots and pork rinds. The rice made it more filling and wasn't necessary.  

Overall, Lotus of Siam was good and we'd come back.  

The entire Thai-fecta was an interesting exercise and while these are three great restaurants known for overall great food and a couple of really unique or famous dishes - I still love my local favorite Thai places."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! I'm craving it RIGHT NOW! We first heard of this place on the airplane while eavesdropping, then our friend we were meeting for dinner suggested it. We typically go to fancy restaurants when we meet up with them, but we were totally down to try this place because we know she knows GOOD FOOD.

When we got in the taxi from the Wynn hotel, the taxi service man told us that it was voted the #1 Thai restaurant by Zagat for over 10 years. WE were sold!

It DID NOT disappoint! They have the biggest selection of Thai food and wine! We paired are good with Riesling which was so delicious for balancing the flavor. 

I can't wait to come back here. The wait IS long. We went at 9:45pm which is when they take the last table searing. The restaurant closes at 10pm"}
{"text":"Actually, service is a 3.5  but food is a 2. Took 3 friends to dinner on 1/14/15. The restaurant was busy from the get go. Being a Thai who is also proficient with Chinese, Japanese, French, and Italian cuisine, I fail to see why this restaurant receives such rave reviews. We order 3 starters and 6 main dishes. Only the following met my expections: Isaan sausage, roast duck curry, and the starter Crispy noodle. The taste was authentic. Everything else was for people who do not know real Thai food. for example, you cannot cook a catfish with Thai holly basil without the holly basil. It is truly a shame. The Pork sate has no resemblance to what the real pork sate is in all over Thailand.
The Isaan soup without any of the Isaan herbs can never be accepted. The Northen pork curry did not taste like anything I had in Northen Thailand. Very unfortunate. On the plus side, the service from the wine stewardess and the food servers were very efficient. We bought a good bottle of red, ordered a bottle of German white and they waived the $25 corkage fee, which is very nice. Not sure what to recommend on Thai restaurants in Vegas. Based on my personal experience, there are extremely few Real Thai restaurants in the country. Look for a place with the majority of clientele being Asians/Thai. Although, most Thais don't eat out in Thai restaurants simply because of the reason I mention mention above.
Good eating."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I do like the new restaurant compared to the last location. On this visit, I ordered Pad See Ew with chicken. There are a lot of Thai options in Vegas and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Amazing food, period.
We ordered nine dishes for four of us. Got amazing services with relatively cheap price."}
{"text":"Extraordinary!  I try to visit every time I'm in Vegas and that's about every month or so.  Can someone say degen?  

So, we had the following and loved them all:

Tom Yum Koong (Shrimp) Soup
Papaya Salad
Combination Fried Rice (chicken, shrimp, pork)
Sea Bass Drunken Noodles
Curry Chicken
Fried Garlic Prawns 
Kao Soi Braised Short Rib
Coconut Ice Cream"}
{"text":"We came without reservations and then directed to the lounge area where there are tiny little tables (3 couches per little table) and one party takes up an area that 3 could be using, so the wait for the bar was another 30 minutes. 
 POOR SERVICE the staff is unable to multi task and think for themselves, we waited another 30 minutes 
AFTER being seated at the bar to order.
  ANOTHER  30 minutes the couple at the bar that just ordered had received food, so we asked where ours was.  
ANOTHER 20 MINUTES I found the manager and our food was never ordered.

THIS IS NOT THE SAME FOOD THAT WAS AT THE COMMERCIAL CENTER.  IT IS NO LONGER LOCAL, THIS IS A TOURIST TRAP.

The food was not amazing I have found similar in the frozen food section.  I recommend looking at other local Thai restaurants and skipping this one."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is definitely by far the best Thai food i've had so far. The service was great and the people were so nice. I came here with a party of 9 and we had to wait about 40 minutes until we were seated. We had some time to look through the menu and figure out what we wanted to eat. Let's just say that we ordered the entire menu! Everything we ordered was really good except for maybe 2 dishes that I could have done without. 

Appetizers:
- Som Thum Papaya Salad: loved it!
- Tom Ka Kai (soup): Coconut milk with chicken and mushrooms. I could have done without this. There wasn't anything special about it. It was really really sour. I would much rather prefer the Tom Yum Soup

Entrees:
- Garlic Prawns
- Pad Thai
- Drunken noodle seafood
- Pineapple fried rice- Didn't have as much flavor as I expected =(
- Crab fried rice
- Chicken Red Curry
- Braised short ribs with panang- Amazing!! My favorite dish from here!
- Sea bass on drunken noodle
- Crispy duck w/ chili mint leaves

We ordered more but I can't seem to remember them all. This is a place you must try when you go to Vegas. Oh and the Thai Tea is good too!"}
{"text":"Went there 3 times,so dissapointed,My food is over cooked.T thai food restaurant at upper jones and flamingo much better."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Lotus of Siam.  Every time I have come here, all of the food has been amazing.  Always start with the crispy rice appetizer.  The flavors are so unique and a great combination of spicy, sour, and crunchy.  I always order the panang curry and it never disappoints.  The Tom Kha soup is also a must have.  All of the employees from the bartenders to the servers are eager to answer any questions, help you navigate through the menu, and point you in the right direction of something you will enjoy.  Don't worry about it being too spicy, just tell them on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you would like it.   it's a gift and a curse that I live so close to this amazing restaurant.  If you're visiting Vegas and want to get off the strip for some great dining you really need to visit Lotus."}
{"text":"This was the most phenomenal experience ever! Their Thai food was perfectly on point, and the service was fast and super friendly. I don't think I've ever had better Tom Yum Kai or Pad Thai. My girlfriend got Masuman curry, and it was absolutely delicious. I am completely blown away by the experience."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam - Thai restaurant average check ~$17. One of my favorite place in Las Vegas and I believe this is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Service is fair to good. Food is the best, they are really consistent so you can come back anytime and the food would be the same, that what get the score. You don't want to come back a month later and the food taste differently, at Lotus of Siam, they give you the \"wow\" expression when the foods come out. When you see the waiters bring out the food to other people, it just makes you want to order the whole menu because how beautiful and tasty the foods are. I would give this restaurant 5/5 because the foods are amazing and extraordinary"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant I've heard a lot of good things about it! Supposedly the best Thai food in Las Vegas. I was quickly disappointed by lousy service and underwhelming food considering the price but what really ruined my night was finding a log hair embedded in my food. To my surprise I still had to pay in full my meal about $100 for 2 people and I got miss changed for the vine as well. They didn't try to keep me as a customer at all!!"}
{"text":"We were recommended to this restaurant and were told that this is an authentic Northern Thai restaurant. 

We have a party of four and  did not make reservation on Christmas day and we waited for 1 hour. The wait did not bother us but the restaurant did. 

First, the ambiance - this is nothing but more than a regular Thai restaurant in any of the US cities. It is a large, noisy, and very crowded setting in a banquet hall. Seats are very uncomfortable, some chairs are even rocking and we were fearful that it could break in any given time. Very plain setting on the table, with one fork and paper napkin. This is certainly not a fine dining restaurant. 

The decor of this place is also very plain. Only a few pictures and some ribbons hanging in a on the walls. Feels like eating in a mess hall. 

A  bare minimum service level is provided. Our waiter came to take our order and offered us some suggestions. The dishes were presented to us by the carriers and the waiter checked back with us only once. Water was never refilled. 

Now the food. We ordered:

1. Golden Tofu as an appetizer - these are cubes of tofu deep fried. Indeed these are chunks of tender tofu, unfortunately, it has zero flavoring. One must use the accompanying sauce ( a sweet lime sauce ) for flavoring. Many other Thai restaurants can do a better job. Price of this dish is $7.95.  Grade B-.

2. Garlic Prawn deep fried - there are 6 pcs of shrimp, size 16 to 20, The shells comes with this dish and they are deep fried solidly and are crispy. Unfortunately, it is slightly too greasy,
In addition, the shrimp is not flavorful and is slightly over fried. Price of this dish is $27.95. Grade C. 

3. Crispy Duck in a curry sauce - there are about 12 pcs of thinly sliced duck breast in a coconut cream yellow curry sauce. This is the best dish of the evening. The sauce is great over rice and the duck breast is tender. If you like Thai yellow curry sauce, you will love this dish. Price is $27.95. Grade A. 

4, Kang Hung Lay - Pork stew in a northern Thai curry sauce. Small chunks of pork along with one large piece of pork belly simmered in a curry sauce. Very flavorful, but the meat is not tender. Price is $17.95. Grade C.

5. Mua Yum Kattie - grilled strips of beef in a sweet and sour Thai sauce. Beef is quite tasty but kind of tough. Price is very reasonable at $10.95. Grade B-. 

In addition, we ordered two Thai ice coffee which is quite well done. Grade A. 

The food bill came to $102+. Then they add a mandatory 18% service charge in addition to the local tax. The total is then $130.

All in all, the food is OK and acceptable. I will recommend this place to my friends if only they can accept the mandatory 18% service charge,  zero ambiance, below acceptable service level and the high price they charge on the food,"}
{"text":"This place gave me and my friends food poison!! we went here for my friend birthday and more then half of us had stomach ache afterwards, our party was about twenty people."}
{"text":"Usually my girl and I hit the Lotus up for lunch, always cranking plus I love the buffet, oh I do put a whoopin on it. On this evening we went for dinner. As there were 4 of us some damage was done. My woman does her usual thing with the larb and chicken coconut soup but then there was chicken fried dumplings, mee crob if I am spelling that right and it was just the beginning. Poached salmon, Fried shrimp, chicken curry, and a whole catfish on the table,  a whole one. We love coming here, and it be showing. For the wine lovers you will be quite impressed. As of yesterday 09/08/17, the roof caved in so you may want to call before you head out"}
{"text":"Eat. Here.  There is a vast menu, food is reasonably priced. The food is well prepared.  I can keep going on  and on, but I am making myself hungry thinking about this place.  Yummo!"}
{"text":"Came here with a co-worker on a Tuesday night.  We tried to make a reservation but they were full, so we decided to an and wait for a table.  We were told it would be a 45-1hr wait, so we popped next door to grab a rink while we waited.

Man, so glad we waited. The food was incredible! We had the chicken dumplings, pad see ew, massaman curry and the veggie fried rice. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. if you like Thai food this is a must while in Vegas.  In terms of location, it's a bit off the strip, a 7 min cab ride, and there is not much around it. The restaurant itself is very casual, and most of the clientele is Thai- that's how you know it's authentic.

Overall it was a great experience. The only thing is that they only serve beer and wine, and I would have loved a cocktail, but it didn't take away from the experience at all."}

The worst part is, i had my beautiful family of 5 with me and i saw them setting up a table for 5 and i was like yeah for sure this is for my beautiful family. BUT NO! they sat some fancy lookin white folks wearing their fancy italian chonies and shoes made from kangaroo nuts made by little Vietnamese slave children! They got seated as soon as they entered the building!! I was very saddened by this and i was about to complain but i remembered what my uncle boe toe always said to me in his native tongue - \"Steety weety, wooo mee? Chuu tee. narnia\" which means \"dont complain\" so i backed off, this was very racist in my mind. I was like damn my family is just as beautiful as they are if not even more beautiful! my son looks like tyra bank! Anyways my fam was seated 30 minutes after our reservation! this is not acceptable! I loved our waiter though, he was a very handsome bald man who pronounced every syllable he spoke very clearly! i give his english skills a A+ for sure, he speak english even better then me ever can! the food portions are now smaller then before. we ordered the fried rice and it was just like a little scoop of ice cream for a pinky baby! maybe only 60 grains of rice thats not enough for my family! he got the garlic shrimps and i loved it! just like how my uncle boe toe used to make for us. its crazy cause you can eat the skins of the shrimps like a chip! it doesnt taste like shrimp chips you get at the china market but more like a crunchy cricket exoskeleton covered in grease! YUM! i ate 3 of them and my stomach pouch started making all these weird noises and it was screaming at me!! i told him to calm down!! he didnt listen. Anyways we ordered alot of stuff but we didnt even get filled up to the cup! we ended up going to the buffet in downtown cause its cheap and you can eat all the french fries you want! o MAn you know how much my fam loves french fries thats why my daughter name is fryonda. This place treat us so so but i loved that waiter he was the only positive of this place i wanna take him home so he can home school my children and i have a spare room for him too, its super nice it got a roku in there and he can watch strange things on netflick."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!

This was my first trip to Vegas, and I'd read about this restaurant.  All of the best food (and best-priced food) we had was off of the Strip and this is no exception.  We got in (2 of us) with no wait at lunch and enjoyed some delicious appetizers and stews.  If I'd had any room left, I would have ordered the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"I had extremely high expectations for this place and was not disappointed after my visit. I like to think I have a decent understanding of Thai cuisine, and it's much more than just Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Pad Se Eww.

The menu here was beyond extensive. We went with the garlic prawns which were recommended to us. I thought they were delicious but I would have thought/liked if they came with some kind of lime/chile dipping sauce. Also had the Isaan sausage which was very good. The nam prik noon was awesome, though I would have liked to see more fried pork skins for dipping. The seabass over the papaya salad was also really good. The seabass was cooked to perfection. The papaya salad was a bit sweet for my liking but complemented the seabags nicely and tasted extremely fresh. Also tried the That iced tea, which I thought was good because it was not too sweet. 

If I had room for more I would have gone with the crispy duck panang and the pork stew.

Plenty of parking but this place fills up fast. The service was good."}
{"text":"Garlic prawns is a must 
Nan nan kang, slices of charbroiled beef was average
Thai Cambodian soup with catfish pretty good
Service is good
Came here at 5:40 and the wait was 1 hour
Waiting room next to the bar"}
{"text":"Food: Combination Fried RIce, Pad Thai, Curry were delicious. Deep fried Pawns were Decent.

Service: Decent. We had a party of 6 and the place was packed for dinner on a weekday.  We waited 30 min to be seated and it took another 10 min or so to get our order through. Food came out quickly.

Facility: Could be better. Floors were sticky and there wasn't a baby changing table in the bathroom!

The place is a little far from where i live (N. Las Vegas) but i would drive down there again to eat me some goooooooood Thai food."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago, just forgot to write a review. 
This place is the real deal. Went with a group of my brother's friends.

Ethnically we were pretty diverse, the Indian group had an opportunity to order what ever they wanted off the main menu but in veterinarian so they weren't shafted with a 15 dollar plate with 2 bucks worth of food. 

The white guys had strong reactions to the food so that's a good sign the place didn't skimp on authentic taste just to win flavor.

This was a few months ago so i cant critique the food like i do in other reviews but i do remember this:

WINE DRINKERS BEWARE, They measure their wine in small glasses and then pour it into the wine glass. We sat near the back and from my position i watched wine drinkers get shafted countless times."}
{"text":"I now understand what all the hype is about. The dishes that they do well are incredible, some of the other options where lack-luster, especially when you factor in the price. I have to say they gain at least a star on the wine list alone. Great selection and variety. I know for my palate I would stick with a white wine, but some of the more complex duck dishes would be a great excuse to try some of their red varietals.

The staff here is kind,fast, and knowledgable. Every recommendation was spot-on. Dishes I will go back for include: 
Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck or Sea Bass
Salt and Pepper Prawns
Chinese Broccoli and Pork Belly
Soft Shell Crab Salad

I was underwhelmed by:
The Beef and mint
Satay
Chili Basil Seared Scallops
Stir Fried Eggplant

I'll have to go back with a different group and take advantage of the staffs suggestions."}
{"text":"Love!! Addicted to their amazing soup (w/ coconut milk). Great fried rice. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good service and best pad thai in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I have ever had! The crispy pork appetizer is something that I still think about often. Very courteous staff with great recommendations."}
{"text":"Yeah, well once you get over the fact that
You're in a beat down shopping mall in a beat down part of town, you enter a nice clean restaurant hopping with natives and tourists alike. The staff is excellent- they are very busy, so respect that, but they enjoy the small talk and are helpful and quick. 
I look for vegey dishes, so it's a bit limiting, but I've been here several times and have always enjoyed my food. It's actually quite good, just wish the portions were larger. Price is extremely fair."}
{"text":"Ok food. Asked for hot on multiple dishes all came out disappointing mild. Flavor was good though. Drunken noodles were markedly better than the pad Thai which is the standard measure for Thai. 

I had high expectations but am leaving disappointed"}
{"text":"Show off your foodie prowess by bringing your friends to this gem off the strip, worth the cab fair. Having had the Anthony Bourdain stamp of approval this spot does not disappoint. 

Main tip, after ordering your typical go-to Thai dishes turn to the back of the menu to a page titled Chef's Choice. Here you will find items that your typical Thai restaurant may not have. 

We tasted the Crispy Duck Panang, Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab, Sea Bass Som Thum amongst other delicious entrees. The flavors are robust. If you are not on your paleo diet, this is your spot. Mix all the spicy sauces in with your rice and leave happy. 

Bonus: they have a decent bar for you to get some beers while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Vegas after the Memorial weekend.  I've heard about this place from a friend back at home so we want to check it out.  It's definitely worth a try!  The location is off of the main tourist section of LV so not easy to find.  It looks sketchy from the outside but you'll be surprised once you enter on the setting and ambiance of the restaurant. The staff are very friendly and attentive.  The food is not the best Thai food I've had but definitely up there in rank.  We would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful . Don't be fooled by the unassuming entrance. As you enter, you know you are in for a special night. Looking at all the magazine articles and awards ( including, three James Beard awards ) on the wall , your senses will be heighten . 
Agreeing with other reviewers, not to be missed is the Duck, garlic prawns and sea bass. As an appetizer,  the NAM KAO TOD is a great choice .Unbelievable! The flavors are so good .
Make sure to make reservations ."}
{"text":"I went in with really high expectations since they had so many reviews and it seemed like everyone was raving about it. To be honest, I've had better. The drunken noodles were a bit on the soupy side which is not what I am accustomed too, and the hot and sour soup was really lukewarm and too sour. The one thing that did taste amazing was the crispy shrimp, but with a price tag of 27 dollars, I could pass. The yelp reviews make it seem like this place is bustling, but when I went in at lunch time, it was not even half full. Either the food at this place has declined or something is up."}
{"text":"Yes, it lives up to the hype. When you look at this place from the outside you might not be impressed, but when you look at the menu and try their food then you'll be a believer. Not only is this authentic Thai food, their selection is immense. Being my first time here I had a hard time deciding what to order, but going by other Yelper's reviews, I ordered:

- Nam Kao Tod (Appetizer): Selected 4 out of the 10 spiciness levels, seemed to be about right for me, but be wary, I saw some other tables sweating and downing drinks when they got too much spice.
- Tom Kah Kai (Soup): Delicious, it has coconut milk on it which gives it a unique flavor, definitely worth a try.
- Drunken Noodle Chicken & Pork Pad Se-Ew (Entrees): The noodles in both of this, out of this world. I personally likeD the Pork Pad Se-Ew better but they were both really good.
- Nam Prik Ong (Red chilli dip): Never had it before, interesting to try, but wouldn't put it on top of my list.
- Coconut ice cream with fried banana: I was so full I wasn't going to get dessert but other people were recommending it. It's definitely tasty, but I would rather save space for trying more dishes.

All in all, the food was absolutely amazing and this is what this place is all about. Kudos for them. Don't miss this place if you're ever in Vegas, it is quite the gastronomic tour-de-force."}
{"text":"This place is BUSY! but hot dang the good was delicious! So clean and delicious! I loved it! Very happy! I am definitely coming here again when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best. Thai. Anywhere.  Better than anything I had in Thailand.  Better than NYC.  Better than SF. Getting the picture?  Make a reservation.  Fills up fast."}
{"text":"Lotus highly recommended by Adam/Palms Place and yelp.  Strange and unassuming location but the inside very accommodating.  No reservation on a Friday but only 10 min wait.
Started with Nam Kao Tod.  Interesting flavors of mint and ginger and a tartness I couldnt place.  I guess lemon grass or lime?  Enjoyed the herbs more than the dish itself.
Ordered garlic prawns, which never came.  Instead opted for Green Curry.  Delicious with fragrant jasmine rice.  Again, the taste of the lovely herbs just danced lightly across my taste buds and the heat just right.   Missed the the vegetables I usually find in the Green Curry-red/green bell peppers.
Staff very attentive but I felt a bit rushed(extensive menu) to make a decision and waiting 40 mins for prawns...well."}
{"text":"This is one of the best and most popular places to eat in Vegas, with good reason. However, be prepared to wait for a while, especially if you have a large group. This place fills up fast and I've seen the line to get in at dinner time extend across the strip-mall area. After leaving Vegas, this is one of the places I miss most. I HIGHLY recommend the khao soi and nua nam tok."}
{"text":"Supposed to be the best Thai food in America.  Pretty big title to live up to.  

Located in a strip mall, a little off the beaten path, but well worth the venture.

Excellent food.  Try not to eat a pepper and if you do, have a glass of milk handy to help tame down the burn sensation.  

The coconut soup was by far the best I ever had.  I wish I could have some now.  

If you get the chance, please check this place out.  Your going to luv it!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. My good friends always mention this place to me and told me I have to try this place out. I wasn't really impressed. Maybe I order the wrong items. I decided not to give up on this place and try it out again. I come to vegas around 4 times a year and this place is always on my list to hit up.

I do recommend to always make reservations at least 1 week in advanced. Or you will be waiting for over an hour. I enjoy going with friends because you then get to try different items on the menu.

Get the garlic shrimp! You won't get disappointed."}
{"text":"No other Thai Food places I went can beat this one. No matter who I bring will always like their food afterward. I am totally in love with this place. Their fried prawn is delicious every time I visit. I used to go vegas for buffet, but damn that was stupid because my money should goes to this place instead! Their duck curry is also top chart so tasty. I feel like no matter what I order there, it's always so bomb. Vegas won't be good without you guys!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet i've ever had and pad thai!  Very small buffet with minimal selections and very small restaurant.  The pad thai tasted like spaghetti and had no meat in it.  Everything in the buffet was lacking any chicken, beef or anything decent, just noodles and vegetables.  The soups were horrendous as well, they had some strange egg soup and beef flavored soup.  Nothing had any flavor or spiceyness to it.  I hope that what they serve off the menu is at least decent but from what i saw the portions didn't look that big.  My stomach has also been quite upset after eating there.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"Shutters 4 Less came to our house today & we met with Trevor about getting shutters for our home that we just moved into.  He was awesome & courteous & great to work with in ordering our shutters.  I would tell anybody to call them"}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait. Come ready to wait in line, and take some time to review the menu or go next door for the massage. The stuffed chicken and shrimp noodles were exceptional. Enjoy a great dinner off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"So many places to choose from this vast and dated strip mall. I just had Thai food the other day and most of the time I don't like repeating similar types of food for at least a few days/meals.. BUT Thai Noodle House left such a savory taste in my mouth that I wanted More!! BUT More from a new place, a place that so many people seem to worship! This place doesn't seem to lure in just us locals but also the rich and famous! I'm ready for Thai food Round 2:

What gave me a New Outlook on Thai Food:

Ground Chicken Larb: ground chicken with chopped onion, green chili, lime juice and fresh cabbage

- Tried this because it was recomended. Quite Fresh, Limey, Crunchy (cabbage) and Chicken was Good. And Most importantly Spicey!! for me at least.. We opted for 4/10 (default, if you don't mention how spicy, you get thir medium hot which starts at 4 Not 5) on the heat scale and this already made me feel like a fire breathing dragon!! Don't be fooled, if your not into spicy you may want to order a 3 at most. For comparison: I've tried a 10/10 heat scale at Pin Kaow and Thai BBQ.. The 4 here was hotter! 

Drunken Noodle Sliced Chicken: pan fried flat noodle, topped with sauteed chicken, fresh and dry chili, thai basil on a bed of greens

- My girl doesn't really eat seafood, so she substituted for chicken. I thought I've tried Great Thai flat noodle chicken dishes in the past but boy was I wrong! Chicken Tender and Very Tasty, Herbs and Spices (3/10 heat) was just right and flat noodles couldn't be any better! 

Pad Se-Ew Sliced Pork: stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg, chinese broccoli and black soy sauce

- One of my favorite all time Thai dishes. I never tried a bad version of this dish but their pork here was better than any I've tried and again the flat noodles stood out themselves. 4/10 heat scale but didn't seem to have as much heat as the Chicken Larb dish?.. Really Good for Pad Se-ew.

Drunken Noodle Halibut: deep fried halibut filet with homemade fresh chili and thai basil, over pan fried flat noodles

- Best Thai dish I've Ever Had.. Period. I don't know where to start.. The fish fillet had a nice breading, lightly fried and was flaky fresh. Their blend of chilis/herbs/spices blend were Unreal!!!! All on top of their pan fried flat noodles! By now you should know how I feel about their flat noodles! I ordered this at a 5/10 thinking it wouldn't be too much heat but it was blazing! Next time I would order this at a 3 but it was So Magically Delicious,  it didn't matter!!

Thai Iced Tea:

- Great way to subside the heat from the food! Had a stronger flavor than usual.

Coconut Ice Cream:

- Very Fresh Islandy Flavor! If you have room for it, Try It!

After having Homemade Thai food and Several Thai restaurants, I think its safe to for me to consider this place the Mecca of Thai Food!  The drunken noodle halibut  revolutionized the way I view Thai Cuisine. My experience here was Insanely Satisfying I wanted to give my waiter a Hug!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for their specialty dishes. We had the duck panang and that was bomb. The duck was perfectly crisp. Just be aware that a smaaaaallllll plate will cost you $30. 

However, the normal Thai dishes were subpar. We got the pad se-ew, tom yum soup, and Northern Lab as well. For the price, it was nothing special. They probably increased the price because of their hype. You can go to cheaper Thai places for the same quality. The hype did not match our expectations."}
{"text":"Sadly, Lotus of Siam has wilted under the limelights. The prices have gone north, the cooking's gone south, and the portions are the smallest I've ever had at a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Thai place I've ever dined at.  The tom yum was outstanding and the lad mar was tender & flavorful. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Epic Fail.

I'll start with 2 things... this restaurant had been built-up to be amazing. \"Best Thai food west of the Mississippi,\" they said. Maybe I built it up so much in my head that the only place it could go was 'as good' and more likely to be 'not as good' as expected. Also, this review is purely based on customer service, as I didn't even get to the food. More on that in a sec...

Strike 1:
I arrived at 1:30p knowing they close at 2:30p. Walking in they seemed busy, but not crazy busy - there was no one else waiting for a table and plenty of open tables. Seeing the 'Please Wait to be Seated' sign, I waited. And waited. And waited. 5 minutes I waited, and nothing. No one. So I gave up on that mission and went to the bar (a counter in one of the main dining rooms) with 2 people eating lunch at it already. There was a guy behind the bar who paused his phone conversation long enough for me to ask him for a food menu, which he gave me.

Strike 2:
As a vegetarian, Thai restaurants are one of the few places I can generally count on to find a reasonable assortment of food that I can eat. That being said, being vegetarian is my thing and I don't /expect/ any restaurant to have vegetarian food.  Don't have it? Cool. I'll go somewhere else; no hard feelings. The menu didn't show any signs of offering tofu as a protein. Not a deal breaker for everyone, but it is for me.

Strike 3:
Back to those other guys at the bar, both eating their lunch when I was handed a menu. So the guy comes over to ask me if I'm waiting for a table, or... No, I'd like to have lunch right here. \"We don't serve lunch at the bar.\" I look over at the other 2 people, and he says \"they're special.\"

OK - thanks very much. See ya. He tries to stop me from leaving, but no. Strike 3 - you're out.

Add that it's pretty far from anything, in a seedy strip mall, with poor decor, ... and I just don't have any reason to go back. Ever."}
{"text":"Don't plan on staying and enjoying any conversation with friends. You order, eat and are rushed out so someone else can have your table. Food may be good but that made he whole experience unpleasant."}
{"text":"It is in a horrible location. There isn't a proper waiting area for all the people waiting to be seated. It was a long wait for nothing. Our party of 4 had a wait of 75 minutes only to walk to our table and see 10 empty tables behind us. We then had to wait another 30 minutes before our orders were brought out. 
The food arrived cold and the service was mediocre at best. They give you paper napkins and disposable chopsticks. It is a glorified Panda Express but at least with them, you get hot food. 
The place is dirty. It needs a good paint job and the carpets have to be replaced. For the amount we paid for dinner, there are much better choices on the strip. I do not see what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"It lives up to the hype. Awesome Thai food...
PAD THAI - 5/5 - Best one ever!
GARLIC PRAWNS - 5/5 - Awesome!!!
TOM KHA KAI - 4/5 - Great!
KHAO SOI - 3.5/5 - My friends liked it. I think it's okay. 
ROASTED DUCK CURRY - 3/5 - It's ok. 
THAI TEA - 5/5 - Delish! No aftertaste.
MANGO WITH STICKY RICE - 5/5 - the rice itself is tasty, not like other restaurants. Excellent!!! Add COCONUT ICE CREAM to it!!!"}
{"text":"Pure plumbing, came out at 9pm,  introduced himself , was very efficient polite and got the job done. Would highly recommend them very courteous and prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"We had very high expectations of this restaurant based on the various reviews we read. We love Thai food and eat it every chance we get. However, this wasn't a great experience. First, the restaurant is located in one of the nastiest parts of Las Vegas. One typically doesn't expect to enter the ghetto to go to a 5-star restaurant. We were very uncomfortable driving through this area and even walking from the parking lot to the restaurant. Second, we had a mixed food experience. I tried a traditional Thai dish that was quite good...4 1/2 stars for that dish. My wife decided to try one of the Northern Thai specialties, which turned out to be very poor and gets a 1 star. Finally, the service was okay but not great. Overall, we might try it again based on the tasty dish I had, but we certainly aren't rushing back."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how this place has so many stars are such a high rating it's okay it's nothing spectacular I went there order food hoping that it was going to be delicious since I heard such great things and red great things I have not been back since ordered sticky rice it was try hard and almost unable to eat food was okay service was not good at all I have since found Le Thai and I will continue going there versus this place was not the greatest experience I've had at a restaurant I'd say try it you might like it however I don't recommend it"}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food and excellent service with good portions. Prawns and catfish is a must!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant not just in Vegas but in US!

I make it a point to dine here everytime I visit Vegas. The quality of food is only getting better.....Service is ok. Definitely, make reservations before you go. It gets very busy for dinner (yes, even on Mondays)...."}
{"text":"The food is very good without a doubt but very expensive when considering the portions. I did find that it had some Thai food that I've been looking for for a very long time and that no one else made so that was awesome. The garlic shrimp was great but the prices really are a bit much for what you are getting. We also ordered the crab drunken noodles and it was good but not as good as their garlic shrimp dish. This place is literally printing money."}
{"text":"Every one said that this is the best Thai food in Vegas. Even a guy sitting next to me when We were eating pho at somewhere else. Indeed, this is the best Thai food as for as I know, not only in Vegas. Recommend crispy duck, squid salad and pineapple fire rice."}
{"text":"This place is the gold standard for Thai cuisine in Las Vegas.  They have a very impressive wine and beer list, but I don't drink.  Everything that we have ever eaten here is top notch and delightful, especially the Crispy Garlic Prawns.  The wait is aggravating, and there is not much space for patrons to wait.  But with an advance reservation, the experience here is awesome.  Would be nice if they could update their decor a little.  While all the Thai decorations are beautiful, the carpeting is way past its prime, and it takes away from the experience a little.  We always come here when we have Thai relatives in town knowing that they will be very happy and impressed."}
{"text":"If you want to find a local gem.. here it is! Notice I didn't say local hidden gem because it's always really crowded. It's a festive place and the Food is really good if you don't mind waiting. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is the best Thai food I have EVER had!!! And I eat a lot of Thai food. The flavours were so intense and each dish was yummy beyond description. The staff was very attentive and professional. A very big win for us!"}
{"text":"I live in LA, so I go to Vegas pretty often, and since I'm also a Yelp fiend, Lotus of Siam had been on my list for many years. Since I rarely wander off the Strip, I managed to miss it on every trip until a couple months back, when I made the trip with a few friends.

We booked well in advance, but were able to change a table for 3 to a table for 5 the day of our dinner. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday, so probably not a peak time, though the place was very busy the whole time we were there. (You can also walk in, apparently, but it sounds like the waits get long.) The restaurant was in a huge strip mall, with the kind of parking lot ideal for teaching teens to drive, or testing specially modified DeLoreans. The space itself was comfortable--not small for a family-run Thai restaurant in the desert, but not big for what could be Vegas's most hyped off-Strip attraction.

I liked the atmosphere, which was homey but upbeat, with tons of accolades and celebrity photos on the wall (though the only person I recognized was Asian fiend Nick Cage). Ah, the bald boastfulness of accomplished immigrants--I know it well. Service was good, fast and attentive, even as a crowd of dishes created near chaos on our table.

The food was excellent, every bite loaded to bursting with flavor. We ordered a family style feast, and everything was delicious and satisfying in that way that makes you wonder, why eat at fancy restaurants when Thai food is just better? Lotus of Siam outshines most restaurants on the Strip, and its price point is a lot more friendly.

The moo yang was irresistible, a plate of marinated charbroiled pork, tenderly chewy with a caramelized char, served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad was classic--green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar--and nicely executed, made with a ton of heat. One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn. I can see why people talk come here for this--it was utterly addictive, deep fried prawns sauteéd in a house garlic sauce and topped with ground black pepper. Tons of flavor, and a flaky, chip-like texture. I don't tend to love prawn shells, but these were put to beautiful use.

The bulk of our meal came in the form of curries and carbs. The khao soi was another house specialty--crispy duck on egg noodles in a curry-based sauce, garnished with scallions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This was spectacular, somewhere between a noodle soup and a curry, with a thick, complex sauce that was thin enough to eat by the spoonful. I also loved the kang hung lay, a spicy stewy Northern pork curry. The portion was small, but the contents were rich, the pork cooked so tender it was falling apart in the curry. On the more everyday Thai side of things, I really enjoyed the panang curry with chicken, and the pineapple fried rice was solid.

The check came before we could order dessert--it's possible our server thought we'd had quite enough, which wasn't inaccurate. There's always next time--now that I've been to Lotus of Siam, I'll drag people off the Strip to go back."}
{"text":"BEWARE  of CC FRAUD !!! My bill was $85 I tipped 16 on top of that. I was looking at my credit card bill I was charged $121. There is no way I left a 36 dollar tip. I still of a copy of my receipt from the restaurant.  So now I have to deal with calling the credit card companies to deal with this and waste my time. This place is so busy so please watch your statement because they will take your money away.  I emailed the restaurant I still have not gotten a response, it's been over a week."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in America. Some of the dish portions were smaller that I expected but we were in a large group and all the dishes were gobbled up really quickly. I loved the duck curry and Thai ice teas!! Wish I had more time to go back again! It's a must stop for international foodies!"}
{"text":"For the first time traveller to Vegas, it's a little out of the ways from the strip. But WOW!, so worth it. The service was friendly, the food was incredible right down to the last bite and the environment very clean and neat. Will do it again and again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to try this place on a random night with my friend! Since I frequently deliver from this restaurant, I had high expectations from the start. The service is always quick and the turnaround is amazing especially since it is always packed.

Be weary of the incredibly long wait that you will most likely encounter when you arrive at the restaurant - I arrived an hour before they closed and I still had to wait 30-45 minutes before I could get a table! However, they send you a text to see a list of other people who are also waiting so that you can leave and come back once the table is ready. There's also a bar where those who are 21+ can wait -- with their wine cellar who can resist?! (I had to drive, so I had to.)

Here's what I had:

Beef pad thai (4/5) // I wasn't expecting the portion to be as small as it was since I'm so used to Thai restaurants giving a hefty load when it comes to pad thai; however, the quality of the food was top notch and the noodles were thinner than what I'm used to. Usually I can never finish portions of pad thai, but this was just enough to fill up my belly!

Mango sticky rice (4/5) // I felt like the mango sticky rice was a little overpriced for the portion they give, but nevertheless the mango was just as sweet as I expected it to be.

Although Lotus is so famous, it didn't really blow me away. Maybe it's because I had such high expectations or maybe it's because I've gone to numerous other Thai restaurants that delivered a better price to portion ratio... but nevertheless for my experience I can't say that it's the best, but the Pad Thai was pretty scrumptious."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!! Have the duck! Reservations are recommended, but if not get there when they open & sit at the bar. A must go to when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm still kind of a newbie when it comes to Thai food, but I do love curry, and Lotus of Siam's was awesome! I came here for lunch with some friends that swore \"it's the best Thai food they've ever had\".  
I had the green curry and tofu over sticky rice. It was the perfect spice level. I also tasted my friends beef satays with peanut sauce which were delicious! 
It was very busy on a Tuesday afternoon, and we waited about 20 minutes, but it was worth it! 
I will definitely come back and try some of their recommended specialty dishes. I'm especially intrigued by the koong sarong (bacon and wonton wrapped prawns) yum!
 Soon, I will be a Thai food connoisseur!"}
{"text":"Always good. The usual a garlic shrimp and crispy duck. A bit on the pricey side or you can say small portions. They should put a bit more food to really make it a home run."}
{"text":"I have to submit a warning to the true spicy - pan Asian food lovers, this does not offer the hyped experience. Italian wine, Chinese tea and sweet and sour chicken - really? Number 7 I use for new places delivered a # 2 weak punch. The duck was truly crispy- and jerky-like. Seafood drunken noodle had obviously frozen packaged mussel and squid - and large pieces of faux crab. Food was serviceable- but not special."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Las Vegas! We ordered pineapple fried rice, duck curry, pad sew ew and a seafood food chili and basil.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing.  We told them we are on our lunch break and they made sure we got everything fast. Prices are also very reasonable for such a popular restaurant. Our bill was $59.00 for 3 people."}
{"text":"By far the best AUTHENTIC Thai food in Vegas.  While everything I've had is good, I especially recommend the Sai Oua (Northern Thai sausage), Northern Laap, and the Kao Soi!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I ate during my recent trip to Las Vegas for RollerCon. My friend and I walked nearly 2 miles to eat here, then had to wait 45 minutes for a table (I would recommend making a reservation), and both the journey and the wait were well worth it.

My friend is a vegetarian, so she ordered the Pad Thai with a few special requests (she wanted it minus sprouts, loaded up with more veggies, peanut sauce on the side, etc.). Our server was very accommodating and only charged my friend an extra $2 for all the changes she wanted.

I ordered the Pad Prik King with chicken and asked for it to be \"pretty spicy\". It was the perfect level of spice (but hey, I like it hot!).

My friend ordered a glass of wine and I had a Guinness since the alcohol prices were very reasonable. Even with the drinks, our entire bill only came to $40. The glass of wine was the most expensive item.

I would definitely make the trek to Lotus of Siam again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is nestled in this bizarre world of tranny bars and swinger clubs.  Off of Sahara, in this plaza that is like a whole nother world!

We went here for lunch and I was super excited to try this place.  While I am partial to Pin Kaow, this place is delicious!

My friend did the lunch buffet.  Everyday they have different food at the buffet and so many things to try!  She loved the egg (??) soup the best!

I ordered Chicken Pad Thai at 5 spice.  (I know, not very daring!) It was very good!  I felt a little rushed when trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, because their menu is HUGE!  Next time, I will check it out online before I go!

It was interesting sitting in there, mostly because there was some sort of wine convention or something going on and all the tables were filled with people drinking wine and on their laptops.  Very interesting.

The down side was the service.  We got there around 12pm and at 1:15pm we never saw anyone after they delivered my one plate of food.  So we found someone and asked for the bill.  Twice.  Then I paid cash.  And had to ask for my change.  Twice.

Other than that, I would totally be back!"}
{"text":"[Note: review is solely for the lunch buffet]

Lotus of Siam has the best lunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  Not because the buffet specials change daily (although tasty variety is nice); not because the ginger tofu dish is tart and spicy in a way that you know they are using fresh ginger; not because the fried sweet potato curry puffs have made me ditch my diet more than once (although, I could honestly pig out on a plate full of those things--crunchy and sweet with a dash of spice . . . mmmmmmm).

No, it's because each dish under the heat lamp is fresh.  In contrast to most of the buffets in Vegas, Lotus of Siam does not leave their buffet dishes under heat lamps for hours.  Each dish is fresh.  Hell, there's not much chance for the dishes to sit for long since the place is always packed for lunch and the kitchen needs to keep cranking out food to refill the buffet options.  

Oh, and the buffet dishes are properly cooked.  An overcooked chicken can ruin a Pad Thai, but you won't find that here.  It's tender, it's seasoned and it's wonderful.

And they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.  The dishes on the buffet aren't overly spicy, but there's plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level.

All around thumbs up."}

GARLIC PRAWNS.

My family goes to Vegas (from Hawaii) 4 times a year and this is the one restaurant they go to every... single... time.

This time my husband and I came on our own. 

We ordered papaya salad, chicken pad thai, and the famous garlic prawns. Also, one thai iced coffee and one thai iced tea. The salad was a good sized portion, but we think it was overly dressed, or they just didn't drain out enough of the liquid before serving it. It definitely packed some heat though. For both the papaya salad and the pad thai, we got to choose our spice level. We like it spicy, but went with a middle number on the scale, as thai spicy is usually more intense, and it was perfect for us. I've had their pad thai before and thought it was amazing, but this time around it just seemed mediocre to me (possibly because it was not even warm, like it had been sitting for a while, when it got to our table). So why the five stars? We came here for the prawns. I repeat: COME FOR THE GARLIC PRAWNS. It's expensive, but a huge portion, and totally worth it. It comes with the shells too, which are also DELICIOUS. They're like crispy garlicky potato chips. 

The price overall seems high, but what we ordered could easily feed 4 people. We took more than half of it for leftovers the next day. So it's actually very reasonably priced. 

Service was okay. Our server wasn't very attentive but it was easy enough to flag down people if we needed anything. 

We will be back (just like my family does 4x a year). Obviously, for the garlic prawns."}
{"text":"THAI CURRY FLAVORS OF THE NORTH
(Warning: young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Please don't order Phad Thai at this restaurant acclaimed for its Northern Thai cuisine (go straight to the back of the menu). My Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow was a more fluid stew of tomatoes, ground pork, and blood chunks over thin noodles. The accompanying lime and cabbages made this very refreshing especially with the slight spiciness tingling my tongue. Hubs took a Crispy Duck in Khao Soi- we worried the curry-based sauce would overwhelm the duck's flavor but it didn't. Instead the outer crispness of the duck, soft and flavorful interior, and creamy sauce all gave a harmony of flavors and textures.

TOP IT OFF WITH DESSERT AND GOOD PRICES
The crispy eggroll dessert (creamy bananas wrapped in a thin shell drizzled with honey) was too much for us to finish. We were stuffed and the pricing here was excellent- very, very similar to many Thai restaurants... which is a special feat when you consider how close it is to the Strip and its outrageous prices.

CASUAL ATMOSPHERE WITH FRIENDLY SERVICE
Lotus's interior is larger than it looks with most seats filled during our Tuesday night visit. And it's super casual- all kinda of people in all kinds of dress were inside. As others have mentioned, Lotus is located in a huge plaza filled with other casual eateries however there was something about the appearance that would caution me not to wander around there alone."}
{"text":"Some of the most intense flavors I've ever experienced, and that's a good thing. I live in Los Angeles where we have many quality Thai places, but my friends pushed me here and I'm glad they did. So many things on the menu you won't find at other restaurants.

After much research, I got the two most recommended dishes on Yelp: Nam Kao Tod and the Nam Prik Ong. The former was one of the most flavorful things I've ever eaten - so intense, with the sourness, spiciness and crispy rice. The Nam Prik Ong was a bit more mellow, but still had plenty of flavor and lots of different textures thanks to the different dipping options.

My wife doesn't like spicy food much, and got some chicken satay and pad thai - both were very tasty without being spicy, so they can definitely cater to any palette. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I was lucky; I did not have a reservation and decided to wait the time needed.  Worth the wait!  And a sudden cancellation allowed me to get seated much sooner than expected.  Ordered Red Curry with Shrimp.

The dish was so delicious I found myself consuming ALL of the shrimp, rice, and veggies - then kept spooning the red curry until gone!  That was a GOOD dish!

I fully recommend eating here - get a reservation or ARRIVE EARLY!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. Had great wine to go with lunch as well. As amazing as the food and wine was however, I would say our server Luke was equally if not more amazing. Extremely personable and willing to give great suggestions plus he was perfect at taking care of his duties.

Will definitely refer this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Took a group of my coworkers here and every one of us was completely satisfied. Food was authentic and delicious, flavorful, good portions. Whether you like mild or spicy food, are carnivorous or vegetarian, you'll find something here for you. For 9 people, the food came out of the kitchen extraordinarily fast. I got the yellow curry and s Thai iced tea - perfect. For my colleagues I ordered the chicken satay, fried rolls, and spring rolls appetizers and we made very quick work of them. 

Staff was friendly and attentive. They can be difficult to get ahold of by phone, probably because of high call volume. They're popular for a reason. Interior was nice and clean (which makes up for the slightly shady-looking exterior... Its in a run down shopping center) they have an extensive wine list, too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food in a shopping center way off the Vegas strip that appears to be a favorite with locals. Amazing garlic crispy prawns, pad see you with beef, pad thai, chicken larb, and BBQ game hen. Service was quick and food was hot and fresh. Very enjoyable meal and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A decent Thai place to grab lunch off the strip. There was no wait when we arrived around 1:50pm. We ordered the tom yum with shrimp hot pot, khao soi braised short rib, drunken noodles soft shell crab, crispy duck w/panang, and garlic prawns. The garlic prawns come with the shell nicely peeled off yet still attached by the tail. Perfect for people who don't eat prawns with shell on. Service was quick and efficient. Each employee was polite and attentive. Everything was good but a little on the pricey side. 18% gratuity was added for our group of 5."}
{"text":"GET THE SHRIMP!!!

Second time here. Just as fantastic as the first time. 

Soft shell crab drunken noodle is bombbb too

Just come and eat here already!!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go here, and so we ventured out at 9:30 on a Wednesday night to find it. Passed it at least twice because it's hidden behind a mostly-dark, what appears mostly-vacant strip mall thing. We turned into it and, there, amidst other mostly-dark and sketchy-looking places, was Lotus of Siam. We really weren't sure we had the right place. We went in, asked to be put on the list, told it would be 40-45 minutes (let me say again, 9:30 on a Wednesday night), and we gave them our number to text. After about 10-15 minutes of wandering around the dark and sketchy area, we got a text, and sat down to one of the best meals I've had, Thai or otherwise. 

We didn't have wine, but they have an amazing-looking glassed-in wine cellar. I ordered a red curry - smallish servings but AMAZINGLY good. My friend ordered a duck dish - I'm not a duck fan, but I would have eaten it all if he hadn't. Just simply amazingly good food. Go, don't be scared, you'll love it. I'd go back in an instant."}
{"text":"Food and service was just outstanding. Thank you fellow yelpers for recommending this place. The Garlic Prawns and Crispy duck was amazing. I found the food and service to be well worth the price. I also found it kind of strange that such a high end restaurant would be located in such a seedy place. I saw broken glass in the parking lot and a sign on the restaurant door warning patrons about break ins. I found myself trying to hurry up to get out before it got dark. I really hope the owners consider relocating to a new location or hire someone for $10 an hour to look out for the safety of their patrons."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Thai food restaurants to which I've been.  The whole catfish with basil sauce was my favorite.  The northern dishes are smaller and make a good appetizer.  Point of note, if the server warns you twice about how hot something is, take the advice.  The decor is not fancy, but the food more than makes up for it!  Make reservations and make sure to arrive on time as this place gets jumping!"}
{"text":"A must stop for any Thai lovers.  This little gem hidden away off the strip is phenomenal. The food, wine and service were top notch.  Don't let the outside restuarant photo deceive you. You will definitely be impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!  Worth the confusing drive off the strip.  Everything other reviews say about the homeless in the parking lot is true BTW."}
{"text":"I had the sweet and sour pork.  I enjoyed it as it was not thick and overly sweet.  Service did take a while but it was very busy.  All in our party thoroughly enjoyed our food and highly recommend that you visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Best Thai food I've had in vegas!!!!
This place gets jam packed so get there right when they open."}
{"text":"Staff is SO polite and friendly and very accommodating. Food was super delicious too!! Tasted just like home (I'm Thai)-- needless to say, next time I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely have to make another visit. Also a bonus: it's not a pricey place!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? Making reservations well in advance is key here. Don't be like those people standing outside for hours because they thought it wouldn't be that busy."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was smaller and less of a must-do for tourists. But thankfully, while the wait time for a table has gone up, the quality and service have remained the same. This is some seriously tasty Thai food! It is easily some of the best I've ever had. Ok, probably, THE best I've ever had. It's a lengthy menu with lots of options. And you can order everything to your personal spiciness level. I've never had anything other than great here. And it's fun to be adventurous and try new things here. If you have to wait for a table, there is a small bar where you can try to grab a seat (or stand around) and get a drink or too. The wait times have never been all that bad, and it's usually much quicker than the estimate they give you. The ambiance and decor are nice. It can feel a bit crowded, but it's not uncomfortable or bad. And it surprisingly not all that loud. All in all, an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"Yum-o! My husband and I were CRAVING Thai food during a recent Sin-City trip and found Lotus of Siam via Yelp (thanks Yelpers!) and what a little gem! 

We had the pepper cilantro tofu dish, excellent.  The Pad Thai was a little off, but that's the only reason why I docked a star.  The service is great, and it seemed like everyone inside was happy to be there - crazy I know! 

I'll be back next time I'm in LV!"}
{"text":"I just came back Vegas, this place is great. There was a line up for dinner on a weekday, so its definately a hit with everyone. For appetizer I had Nam Kao Tod (crunchy salad) &  with Tom Kha Kai (soup) which was flavourable and aromatic. For main I had Khao soi with tofu (curry) & Green Chicken Curry was delicious. Finally dessert, I had coconut ice cream which was very pleasent not too sweet. I wish this place was bigger but for what it is, one word awesome!"}
{"text":"Words can't explain this place...the food..the service...the ambience is something that always pulls us back when we come to Vegas. We literally eat here daily when we come and there is so much menu that you do not get bored and we have been coming for years..."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from some locals and had to try it out. We didn't have reservations so we showed up about 15 minutes before they opened and joined the line that had formed. We were seated quickly, and the service was great. Our order was pretty traditional, fried wontons, cashew nut chicken, yellow chicken curry, pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, and drunken noodles. My favorite is the yellow curry, sweet but with a good amount of heat. The menu is extensive and I'm sure if we were more adventurous in our ordering we would not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"James Beard award winning restaurant in a ghetto stripmall in Vegas? Why yes there is! Had to convince my friends and family to actually stop in but once we got there, sat down and tried their lunch buffet everyone was thanking me! One of the best Thai food places I've been and it was a buffet. I don't really like buffets because I'm always concerned about the freshness of the food. This place was amazing and crowded but the best pad Thai ever!"}
{"text":"I like Thai ice tea and yum woon sen here. I ordered som tum and moo yang as well but those are ok."}
{"text":"The outside of the restaurant looks a bit deceptive. But it is nice inside. The food is excellent. The Masuman Curry with steamed tofu (#132) was absolutely delicious.The curry was very flavorful and the veggies perfectly cooked. I do wish that they had a bit more vegetarian options.

Oh, and the wine! How could I forget the wine.They have an extensive wine list.

I would absolutely go back to Lotus of Siam and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"went with friends, was good, big place and seemed busy, good sign.
everything was on par with with I like about Thai food 
nice evening"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because after having Arawan Thai, no place else deserves 5 stars. I think the dishes at Lotus of Siam are great, but sometimes can be tendon or Fatty like. The flavors are awesome though and we always receive our food quickly. A must try is the crispy rice on the appetizers!  The menu is so huge I don't know where to start, but I love a big selection,  so I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"I like to eat; don't let the small frame fool ya.  Having already experienced Pin Kaow Thai on Rainbow, Archie's Thai Kitchen on Flamingo, and Archi's Thai Cafe on Sahara, I am displeased with Lotus' serving size for Pad Se-Ew, which is stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs, choice of chicken, and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce.  To supplement the entree, as a dessert I tried the Mango with Jasmine Sticky Rice and both were quite tasty.  However, I am dissatisfied when I spend money yet remain hungry; therefore, I do not envision myself returning on an empty stomach any time soon."}
{"text":"Ordered:
-drunken noodles w beef 
-rad na w beef
-lunch buffet

Came in around 1:30pm on a fri and got seated right away... Unlike last time where came in the evening and waited an hour and eventually had to take to-go. 

First, it took them 15 mins for them to take our order. Then I was waiting for my food. Everyone finished their food before they brought out my dish. And when they did, they got the order wrong. After waiting another 20 mins, they got the order wrong a second time, so I asked for them to take it off the check. Considering that it wasn't that busy, I'm not sure why service is so bad.

Also, the lunch buffet doesn't really get refilled much after 2.

Food's good. Service was terrible, and they didn't seem to give a shit. If we ever choose to come back, we'll probably just order to-go next time!"}
{"text":"10 bucks for a horrible buffet in a grimy strip mall.  The irony is that the owner (according to articles on the wall) is responsible for Renu Korn in Norwalk, Ca, the best Thai place I've ever been to..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! we do take out often because the wait can be pretty long if you dont make reservations."}
{"text":"This place used to rock, now you'll feel like a rock waiting to be seated for food that they have dramatically raised the prices on and even had the nerve to make the portions much smaller.

Lotus Siam of the past, you'll be missed. =(

I recommend the little Thai pace on West Sahara a few blocks west of NV Energy for better food, better prices and better customer service."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. I've been coming here for years on annual trip with friends and the food is just incredible.  The crispy duck in red curry, drunken crispy prawns are favs.  I enjoy these dishes at other places but they nail it. It's beyond discovered so make reservations"}
{"text":"This is a 5 hands down. The Garlic Prawns, the Pad Thai and Khoa Soi were all incredible.  The service was perfect, and the wine list is overwhelming. 

We showed up at 9:00 on a Sunday and still waited 30 minutes.  Well worth the wait. Better than anything you find on the strip."}
{"text":"We found this hidden Michelin one star Thai restaurant at a very ghetto plaza downtown Las Vegas. I can't believe how good the food is! The restaurant also has a huge wine collection plus a full bar inside!!! Ordered Sea food soup+ Northern Thai sausage+ black beans pepper fried chicken wings+ drunken noodle with crispy roast duck+yellow curry with chicken+ Chilean sea bass with leman grass. Every dish was amazing! Will come back soon! 

I took one star off was when we called to make a reservation and the host told us they don't take party smaller than 5. We were four people that night so we had to wait in the line. However, when we arrived we saw there were two and three people parties got reservations. We waited 35 minutes on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"The hype, the fame, the name, the desire to be able to say I've been there and recommendations bought us here.  However, David V. captured it best when he stated that L.O.S. appears to have been \"the\" Thai spot a few years ago. 

AMBIANCE
L.O.S. is located in a sketchy little strip mall off Sahara. The interior is a clean, no frills decor, and the restaurant lacks a waiting area.

FOOD   
Following Yelp recommendations, we ordered:

-Garlic Prawns                                            (5 STARS)
-Drunken Noodles w/Soft Shell Crab     (4.5 STARS)
-Chicken Pad Prig Khing                          (3.5 STARS)

Our meal was good/okay, but when I think of L.O.S. I smile more about the people watching (which was super juicy) than the meal."}
{"text":"Got in line before they opened.  We were #50 in line without a reservation.  Short gal with long hair told us 15 min wait. Others came and got seated after us but we waited...right by the front cash register.  Finally after 45 minutes we complained and she said she must have overlooked us on her list...but we were right there in front of her. How can that be?  I was pissed. Had plenty of time to look at their extensive menu. Lots of dishes I've never seen before,  even when I visited Northern Thailand.   

Got the Sea Bass in a sweet & spicey sauce. Loved it.  So delicately battered but only 3 good size pieces for $28.  Tried the Crispy Garlic Prawns in shell for roughly $25.  Everyone was ordering them. I think we got 5 giant prawns and the rest was just deep fried shells. They were very tasty, not at all greasy but I felt a little bamboozled and would have liked a few more prawns for the price.  Tried the egg rolls because my son wanted them but why fill up on standard fare with such a unique assortment of food so masterfully prepared?  We also got a Northern Thailand dish of slices of beef in a rich dark sauce ...almost a gravy over egg noodles. Very complex flavors.  We asked for a 7 on the spicey scale and we were sweating! They don't dumb the food down here so be prepared.

Too full for desert so they gave us a scoop of homemade Coconut Ice Cream on the house.  There was also an appetizer of some sort of spicey Thai Chili Pepper rice.  Not great. The service was superb. Warm, caring, quick, friendly...like you're in their house and they care if you're happy or not.  The bil was over $100...the most I've ever paid for a Thai meal, but there were plenty of lower cost items on the menu -- just not ones I felt like ordering that night.  I'd absolutely go back if in Vegas again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem, but go early and make reservations if possible."}
{"text":"This place is definitely good, but the best???  Hardly!
The prices are high and the portions are small.  

And how come you never (or RARELY) see any Thai people (or Asian for that matter!) eating there???   That alone should be a clue people!!   Again, touristy and over-priced!

Go to Komol across the parking lot!!"}
{"text":"The service was great, no doubt. The food however is overpriced and disappointing. I ordered signature Thai dishes to get an honest measure but they failed to even deliver the fundamentals properly. Yes I have been to Thailand (numerous times) and I lived in Asia for over 18 years. I think this place gets most of it's business because of it's proximity to the over priced \"Strip\" and inexperienced tourists. Sorry folks, this place is overrated."}
{"text":"Fried prawns and pad see ew all the way!
Seriously, the BEST and I mean BEST thai food in the US.
I've eaten a lot of thai food and mannnnnn...  I will kill my diet again for this.
Thank God I don't live in Vegas cause I would eat this place out of business."}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas, you have to eat here.

  Most importantly, the food is amazing. Thai food is my favorite and there is no better place than here. They give very generous portions for the prices you're paying and it tastes incredible. Everything I've tried here has been amazing. Your Vegas trip is not complete unless you eat at Lotus of Siam!!"}
{"text":"We came here again on 12/15/15. This time the service was friendly and appropriate. We ordered the Golden Tofu which was ok but not outstanding in the flavor department - crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside but needed a different and stronger sauce. Next came the Tom Kah Kai soup which was enjoyable but again, lukewarm like on our last visit. The we also had the Koong Char Num Plar - raw prawns with lime juice, marinate and a chili and tamarind paste (delicious) - nice combination of flavors. 

We have visited many Thai restaurants across many States but we really fail to understand why Lotus of Siam is so highly celebrated - they are good but we are not blown away."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai! Craving Thai this is the place to go, they serve their meals hot and provide a strong variety in their menu.  They also provide northern Thai dishes which is not very common.  This is the first Thai place I have been to with distinctive Northern Thai dishes.  If you're wanting to switch it up a little from your normal Thai joint give this place a shot."}
{"text":"If I am in Vegas I have to stop by here. The best Thai food, hands down. Not only is it so good, the service is great and food comes out fast.

He must haves are the garlic prawns, tom yum kai soup, and crispy duck panang curry.

Make a reservation to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"The place is in a sketchy neighborhood, the inside was a dump, the charbroiled beef was all fatty, and the Penang was mediocre. My jasmine tea didn't even taste like jasmine!  They even messed up desert! The sticky rice was poorly made and the fried banana was oily. The coconut ice cream was powdery tasting and not much flavor.  Not sure what all the hype is. Maybe people are just starstruck by the pictures of famous people that ate here a long, long, time ago."}
{"text":"Known for being one of the best Thai Restaurants in all of Las Vegas. Hmm it hadn't tasted like anything I never had at a little Thai restaurant. It was really good and authentic . But for the reviews I had expected a Thai experience the way this place was hyped up. But all in all really good .
I recommend to set reservations because the wait is up to 40 mins on a slow day."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food a lot and no joke this is by far the best ever. Very authentic and a huge variety. There honestly is nothing like this amazing gem!"}
{"text":"Lotus is legit. You know it's legit when your cabbie perks up immediately when you mention that you want to be taken there from your hotel on the Strip. During my most recent trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago, I boarded a cab from the Palazzo and indicated to the cab driver to take me to the Lotus of Siam. He simply said in his Yugoslavian accent: \"best Thai food in Las Vegas...hell, best Thai food in the country! I love that place.\" It seemed like an honest review, but not Yelp Elite caliber. 

So here goes mine, hopefully a bit more fleshed out:

Lotus lets people in around 5:30pm for dinner service. Knowing this, if you arrive a little before this time, you will see a group of people standing outside, all wanting to be the first one in. There's no order to the way people congregate outside, but there's an unspoken rule to just keep a mental tab as to who arrives after you, and when the doors swing open, to make it inside the restaurant before them. The sooner you sit, the sooner you eat! No pushing or shoving, though the temptation to invade others' personal space is strong as you try to think of what to order in advance in your head.

As you shuffle inside, you'll be greeted by newspaper snipets featuring Lotus in the local papers. You'll see plenty of photos of famous people (both American and presumably Thai) over the years, enjoying the food at this Las Vegas institution.

According to others in my group, the restaurant was expanded relatively recently to include the empty neighboring space. That effectively allowed the owners to add a wine bar and a wine storage room, as well as more dining space. It doesn't seem like there's much activity going on at the strip mall where Lotus is located, so the whole wing of the building can be converted to more Lotus as far as I'm concerned. It would be way better that way, really.

Service has always been kind and friendly whenever I come here, as per Thai tradition. I've only been a couple of times, but with all the stuff I've ordered and shared with my group (it's an extensive menu), I did not find one thing I did not like.

I recommend the jumbo fried shrimp/prawns to open things up. You can, and should, eat the skin. I don't usually do so with any fried shrimp, but the way it was cooked with the peppering and seasoning, it was almost like having twice as much prawn. Those will disappear in a couple of minutes (because of some secret crack-like substance that the cooks sprinkle into the batter, I'm sure), so I also recommend the yellow curry (though I don't think the color matters...they're all really savory and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking) and the fried, boneless catfish (either with curry paste or garlic pepper sauce). Eat that with a side of salad and some white rice and wash it down with some Singha, and you'll be golden.

As mentioned earlier, you can take a cab here from the Strip if you're visiting from out of town, or drive your own car here. The only problem is getting a cab back to your hotel or next destination. You may want to have the host arrange a ride back for you before you sit down to eat, otherwise, you may have to go out into Sahara Road and flag one down yourself or pray that you find one just emptied of passengers intent on coming here in the parking lot. That would be called \"Lotus luck\" or, winning the Lotus lottery."}
{"text":"When I told the door guy who was hailing our cab we were headed to Lotus of Siam, he responded: \"you must have done your homework\".  This hidden gem is some of the best Thai food I've had.  Or cooked.  There were items on the list I had not even heard of, and I have put Lotus on my list of places to eat during our yearly trip to Vegas.  
We knew we were going to have to wait a bit, but we did not know we had the option of making a reservation prior to arrival.  We should have done that.  But, you know how Vegas is...you just wonder around with a drink in your hand until you're hungry.  Luckily, they allow you to order an appetizer and drink in their bar.  So, that's exactly what we did. It really did not seem like a terribly long wait for me, but the husband almost fell asleep after consuming a plate of delicious Thai Beef Jerky. 
The meal was fantastic.  Although, I wanted to try some old favorites to compare them to what I know, I ventured out and ordered two dishes I had never had, for the table.  The husband got some kind of fried rice that he seemed really happy with, and he enjoyed some of my dip that I ordered.  Unfortunately, my actual meal is a bit hazy; however, the tables next to us also had delicious looking food and our service was spectacular.  We will be back.  I even brought the food back to the hotel, which was not really a smart idea because I was never able to heat anything up, but that's just an example of how much I enjoyed my meal.  
I'd recommend this place to anyone that enjoys Thai food.  I see a couple of negative reviews, but everything we ate was fresh, the bathrooms were clean, the service was top notch, and our food was spectacular.  I'm a retired chef and I've spent many years studying and serving Thai food, so my expectations are high.  I'd say Lotus met my expectations and definitely lived up to the hype.  I look forward to our return."}
{"text":"Every time Im in vegas its a must that I stop by and eat at this amazing place.  \"Dont judge a book by its cover\" relates to this place. My friends constantly rave about this place and the first time ive been there I stepped outta the the car and remember saying \"were gonna eat here\" boy was I wrong.  This place is ammmmmaaaazing!!! We ordered the garlic prawns, beef in curry sauce and hot/sour soup and sticky rice with mango for dessert.  Servers were very nice and always refilled your drink even when you just take a sip.    Inside is very clean and chill and does not look anything like the outside.  Our meal for 4 was around $70 which beats the burger joint in Mandalay for $122!!!  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went a little earlier and tried the buffet.  It's nothing special.  Dishes tended to be very oily and/or boring and/or over-spiced.

LOS is located in what must be one of the strangest outdoor shopping centers, or whatever you call it, in the country.  Mostly down and out and closed, but the far end seems to be populated with pervert joints, and odd Asian places are scattered around, as well as a bail bond and lawyer office and a jewelry store or two with many guards, and miscellaneous other strange flotsam and jetsam.."}
{"text":"Just like many others, I longed to visit Lotus of Siam after seeing Anthony Bourdain to there on his show. It seemed fortuitous because I saw the show one month before a planned visit to Vegas. After going there with three other foodies, we all agree that it's a must-stop while visiting Vegas! We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.

We decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! 

It's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead. I'm already anticipating my return to this excellent restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I definitely would give this place a five star. Wait staff is attentive and the food was delicious. Hands down the best Thai food I've had ever! We waited an hour to eat but we were seated at the bar while we waited for a table. Great spot to converse and drink wine and beer. 

The food did not fall short of expectations, it actually surpassed it. The atmosphere was very appealing. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it was actually very roomy and the decor was beautiful. Not to mention all the pictures of celebrities in their restaurant.

I would definitely recommend their crispy duck Panang curry and soft shell crab drunken noodles. You cannot go wrong with these dishes. It's very appealing to the taste buds, I never knew duck could taste so good!!! 

I look forward to becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"Came in at 1:45pm on a Tuesday for lunch, no line! I was seated immediately. The restaurant is big and airy with high ceilings and lots of lights. There's a bar area as well and you can choose to sit in the bar lounge or at a table. They said it's the same menu. Everyone was very nice and my server was helpful. I ordered: chicken dumplings, papaya salad, tom yum kai, and drunken noodles with garlic prawns.

Chicken dumplings - Came out piping hot! Crispy but not greasy, good light sweet and sour type sauce, good flavor but not very strong. There were a lot, 8 I think, so a good side appetizer.

Tom yum kai - Not the best I've had, but solid. Lots of chicken in the cup. Broth was good, but not as complex in flavor profile as some I've had. Broth was a little greasy, but overall good and I enjoyed it.

Papaya salad - Similarly, good, but not the best I've ever had. Also not as complex flavor profile as some I've had, but the papaya was fresh and the sauce good. Portion looked small, but more was there than visually appeared.

Drunken noodles with garlic prawns - Looks amazing. Presentation was spot on. The noodles were good, but again, not as complex flavor as some drunken noodles I've had, but solid, enjoyable, and good. The prawns were AMAZING. Hot and cooked well, they weren't too greasy and fried to perfection.

Service: Okay. The dumplings, soup, and salad came out very quickly, probably about 8 minutes after I ordered, but the drunken noodles took FOREVER. There was about a 20 minute gap between the first 3 coming out and the noodles. That would have been fine if they were keeping me updated, but no one came by to tell me it would be a while or that they were on the way. I was about to flag down my waiter and ask when they appeared. I don't need it to be fast; obviously fresh, hot, made to order is preferred, but an update would have been appreciated. Overall my waiter was nice and helpful, but not very attentive.

They do put a bottle of water on the table so you can refill your own glass which I very much appreciate. I hate having to flag people down for water refills!

Overall, a good dining experience. I'd come back, but I can get better, cheaper Thai food at home in LA."}
{"text":"45 min wait for Thai food , little much.
Called to make reservation, line was busy after 11 try!
The dishes very pretty decent on spices and quality, but nothing fantastic!

The soups was above average and you could tell they use fresh ingredient.

Service was slow. 

The only reason I give it 2 star is the drunken noodle dish was cold, noodle were stocked together and tasted funky, 3 hours later I got a pretty bad diarrhea !! I like to think it was not their food, but that was my only meal that day"}
{"text":"Had to try this out, and didn't regret it, not at all.   Skeezy neighborhood, but plenty of traffic to this restaurant, so it's not an issue.  Got there a bit after 5:30 and hardly had to wait at all; by 6, though, the line was well out the door.  Had a crispy rice appetizer with sour sausage, a creamy and spicy Bangkok soup with chicken, and a Northern Thai red curry with catfish, loaded with vegetables.  All very tasty!  Also, they have a great sake selection (tip from the taxi driver).  Was checking it out by my lonesome, yet the staff was friendly and helpful.  As far as I am concerned it lived up to the reputation and I'm very glad I had the experience."}
{"text":"AWESOME. Best Thai food I've ever had. Crispy duck with drunken noodles was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is a wanna be fancy restaurant when it's in a junky ghetto plaza and then they didn't change the carpet when it carpet is a 1970s carpet. They put in a wine rack and lots of wine selection but don't change the carpet. They need to do the whole shebang. 

I had lunch special chicken curry. It was good and it has grape in it. I thought that was unique but not fancy. Like I said they is a wanna be fancy."}
{"text":"I agree with the fact that the portions don't justify the prices, but the food is also REALLY really tasty.

FOOD
  Garlic Prawns - THE BEST!! Sooo glad we ordered this dish based on the reviews. I would've ordered another one if we weren't already so full! The prawns are huge and fried to PERFECTION. Super crispy and seasoned just right. I will definitely come back and order this every time. GO GET YOU SOME!!
  Sea Bass w/Drunken Noodle - Lightly crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside. Paired very well with the noodles and the flavors were well balanced. Worth trying, but definitely small for the price ($30 I think?). I'll be trying something else next time.
  Crispy Duck w/Panang - Very yummy! You get to choose your spiciness level from 1-10 so I got 8. The spiciness wasn't spaced out very evenly, as the first couple of scoops of sauce/duck were very spicy and the last few bits weren't spicy at all. The sauce was delicious with rice, but I think I'll try the dish with mint and chili instead. I feel like the sauce made the duck less crispy. 

AMBIANCE
Looks very unassuming from the outside. You would never know that such a great restaurant was located inside an old plaza like this. The restaurant itself is pretty large as they bought out the space next door and expanded. They even have a wine cabinet/wall displayed with TONS of wine to choose from. Everything from the decor to the music is pretty Asian/traditional.

SERVICE
Monday lunch service was super quick and our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering! The servers are also very knowledgeable and gave us some good recommendations.

OVERALL
Definitely coming here again! I'm so glad we were able to stop by, especially at a good time and with no wait! Even if you've never tried or don't care for Thai food, I still recommend trying this place. The quality of food is something I've never seen at any Asian-owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Decor : 4.7 stars
Service : 5 stars
Food : 5 stars

Located closer to the strip. Parking spots are big enough so no worry for parking.

Ever since the old location closed down, I've been waiting for the new location.
Thanks to my yelper buddy, Peter S , who updated the new location. 

Lunch time was packed and I didn't make any reservation but I was lucky I got the table.
Greeted with smile by the host ( who I didn't know the name), she took me to smaller dining room.

My servers, Bank and Tai were both professional and attentive from taking orders, serving food, packed my left over until serving my dessert.
I met them at the old location and it seems great to see familiar friendly faces.

So, thank you to both Bank and Tai for making my \"first experience \" superb and enjoyable in the new location .

Kudos also to the Management who maintain the quality of work and quality of food taste.

My food were seasoned pretty well and delicious as usual so I know the restaurant strive to keep the great quality like in the old location and even more if it's possible.
I ordered Garlic Prawns, Drunken noodles with beef and Thai tea crepe cake for dessert.

The price only few dollars different than the old prices so Not a big deal. I definitely got what I paid for.
Recommended to all who love food, try the Northern Thai food. From curry, seafood, basil sauce , the taste are a lot better.

Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai off the strip! It was so good, we came here multiple times to try more of their extensive menu. 

The first night, we made a reservation because we had a group of 14. We had to book this nearly a week in advance. After that, we were able to get a table for 4-6 people without a reservation near the restaurant's opening time for dinner. 

Ask them for their best dishes --  they're cooked to perfection. Other menu items are also good."}
{"text":"Started coming here 7 years ago. They specializes in Northern Thai cuisine. The restaurant has expanded and they no longer offer the lunch buffet. We always order ala carte so we didn't miss it.
Food here always tasted authentic and still one of the best around town.
The portions does get smaller over the years and they have quite a few subtle price increases.
Every time I try a new Thai restaurant ( in the US) Lotus of Siam is how I rate my food.
So far, they're on the top as the most consistent in taste.
They offer a wide selection of wines if beer is not your thing!
Reservation is a must if don't want to wait in the seedy parking lot after dark. Otherwise, come early before they open at 5.30pm."}
{"text":"I love this place! Probably my favorite Thai restaurant here in Las Vegas (so far!). My favorite is the garlic prawns and I just have to have it when we come here. They're pretty consistent with their service. Haven't had a problem so far."}
{"text":"We were SO excited to try this place out---mainly because every Vegas guide said it was the best Thai anywhere! I think we made a mistake to go for the lunch buffet. First of all, the location is pretty weird. It's in a run-down strip mall and the entrance is in the back. Anyway, it took a LONG while to get there from the Strip as we had to take the Deuce bus and then walk for a while before we found it. So, finally we're there and we're expecting to have a religious experience. Not so. Basically, it was a regualy buffet---I didn't even think it was Thai food for the most part! So, next time we're in Vegas, we're going for dinner. Yes, I'm willing to give it another shot. Seems to me that the great reviews are based on dinner, NOT the buffet."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite Thai restaurant! We go every time we are in Vegas. Love the new location!!! Much easier to find and plenty of parking. They are always busy!!! Best to go during lunch or make reservations for dinner way in advance! Great indoor waiting area.  Friendly service. Nice decor and ambiance.

Our favorite dishes are the Pad Thai Chicken, Khao Soi Crispy Duck and Garlic Prawns. We also like the Panama Chicken and Yellow Curry Chicken. 

Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food of my life. I love Thai food and I now have a mandatory stop in the Vegas. We got the seafood drunken noodles, yellow curry, fried rice and cucumber salad. Everything was so fresh, flavorful and gigantic portions. My fav was the curry followed by the noodles. The seafood in it was incredible: shrimp, scallops, crab, calamari, mussels, they did not rip you off at all. The restaurant is brand new and very nicely decorated. I had heard about the original for years and glad this new outpost seems to keep the quality. $60 for all this and it was worth it. It fed two, but totally could have been for three."}
{"text":"Poor service and extremely long waiting to be seated and to be served food.

Doesn't worth it."}
{"text":"I am still looking to find another Thai restaurant that beats this place--not in terms of ambiance but in tastiness. It is excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai restaurant I've had the pleasure of visiting so far!!

When you think you want a spice level of 8 and the wait staff recommend something lower....you should trust them.  We started our foray into their legendary cuisine with the glass noodles and were pre-warned about the heat level.  Those were some of the hottest noodles I've ever had.  It was definitely an experience everyone should have.  The rest of our dishes, which were also very hot compared to what I normally eat, were mild in comparison and at the end of the meal I craved the masochistic spice level of the noodles.

Every dish was excellent and the 40 minute wait was worth it.

The strip mall location is very deceiving and before you walk in you expect some sort of \"sleazy massage parlor full of henchmen waiting to kill you\" environment.  But once you walk in the door you are very nicely surprised at the decor, the lively ambiance, and the large array of wines.

Next time I return to Vegas I will definitely return here!  There are way too many items to try and it may take 10 more trips."}
{"text":"Yes, the location is a bit sketchy, lock your doors or park near one of the Bentleys (really).

Yes, it's crowded and noisy, the line is usually long and they don't pick up the phone...

And yes, it is the best Thai food you will ever eat! The food here will replace your previous perceptions of what good Thai food is, to the point that the mediocrity everywhere else will become unacceptable.

Be careful of the 1-10 heat scale, it's real!

If you don't like flavor and texture, this is not the place for you. Bland is not on the menu (except for white rice)."}
{"text":"People keep saying this is the BEST Thai restaurant ever so of course I was extremely curious because majority of the place who people say it is, it normally isn't. Our first stop in Vegas was Lotus of Siam. The place is alot bigger inside and it can seat ALOT of people. We order a round of Singha and sake and then order 4-5 dishes. All of the dishes was good but nothing shinning or the best Thai food ever. I like their pad mee and they do put nice things like soft shell crab on certain dishes. Sadly I think this is a AVERAGE restaurant with AVERAGE food. There a lot better Thai food in Hollywood then here but guess if you think of average white people or people around US then most people would think this is the best. Yes i just say that!!"}

But it was nice, refreshing, flavorful, and spicy. SPICY! I should say. Note to self, order mild next time. It was packed for lunch! It's always packed! Make reservations! So much better to go in big groups, so that you can order more dishes to try. But hey, when in Vegas, this place is a MUST. We get it to go if we have to, or I'll even have lunch by myself if the bf is at a conference. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"true story:

lotus of siam recommended by fellow yelper jim c.

curries ranging from level 1 to 10 in spiciness.

someone orders level 5, another orders level 10.

i can't handle spicy food, but i brave this one and try the level 5 with a big spoonful of rice. 2 seconds of chewing and my mouth is doused with gasoline and set on fire. 15 seconds later, i get an instant nose bleed.

thank god i didn't try the level 10.

i'm sure everything else tasted lovely, it's just that my incinerated taste buds failed to work after the curry."}
{"text":"This is one of the best surprises in Las Vegas. Situated in a somewhat seedy shopping area, it isn't a place that grabs your attention, but those adventurous souls who are willing to take a chance will be rewarded with very friendly service and a dining experience well worth going out of your way for. Whenever we have company from out of town, I always try to find time to take them to Lotus of Siam. Seeing their skepticism turn to delight when they encounter the wonderful smells, smiling employees and delicious food is so much fun."}
{"text":"I was told that I can't go to Las Vegas without trying the food at Lotus of Siam. I wasn't disappointed. 

For starters, we ordered the Tom Kah Kai and it was definitely a different take on a typical Tom yum soup. It was creamy from the coconut juice with just enough of tart and spiciness to compliment the abundance of chicken, mushrooms, and galanga. It was a great way to start off the meal.

For the appetizer, we ordered the Som Thum (papaya salad) and when asked if we wanted mild, medium, or spicy, we ordered medium. OMG, I am part Thai and I couldn't even take the spiciness. I tried to get seconds, but my friend was able to eat her seconds and my seconds. It was way too spicy for me. If you love hot and spicy, then you won't be disappointed. Before the heat kicked in, I really enjoyed the flavor. Three full glasses of ice water later and I was able to finally taste the next dish.

For the main course, we ordered the yellow chicken curry. This was among the top 10% of the yellow chicken curry dishes that I have ordered at other Thai restaurants. It was as good as my Dad and Mom would make. With rice, it definitely qualified as yummylicious. 

For a good place to go if you are tired of buffets, pay a visit to this place. This was the first time that I was able to go to Las Vegas and not eat at a buffet. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a place to try for Thai food and the atmosphere/service in Las Vegas. When servers continue to refill my water, I'd say service is great. Food wise, food was good, but it is more on the pricey end when food taste comparable to other Local Thai joints. If you never been, definitely need to at least try!"}
{"text":"Despite the price, the food is wonderful! I recommend the soft shell crab with cabbage under I believe. This place is to die for. I would go here every time I visit Vegas. Op."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try Lotus of Siam, because I already have my favorite Thai places in town. One evening my girl finally convinced me to give them a try. We ordered this really amazing rice dish appetizer and shared the drunken noodles with prawn and a duck curry. The appetizer blew us both away. I would come back for that dish alone. The noodles and curry were great too. Very spicy and tasty. I'm looking forward to my next dinner at Lotus."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good. Come later at night if you want to get in without a reservation. The drunken noodle seabass was the highlight for me. Servers are excellent and you can always trust them to order for you (I did this and it was fun trying new things. Great old Riesling wines that contrast the spicy amazingly. Have to order the mangos for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here with a date. Service seemed fast (or maybe cause I was having a decent time). There was a nice variety of food and they can customize if you need vegetarian. The menu looks cool too"}
{"text":"I love Thai food but hubby doesn't so I don't get a chance to get it often.  However hubby was out of town so I headed to Lotus of Siam as I've always heard great things but have never tried it.  Went alone on Friday night and the place was packed at 7:30.  Wait was to be about 30-45 minutes but only took 15 minutes! Had a nice table in a quite room of the restaurant which was very nice.  For being just one person dining I felt like royalty as I had continuous attention from the staff taking care of my needs.  Had the best Tom Kah Kai soup I've ever had!  I seriously could have made a meal out of that!! Then the crispy duck with Panang, absolutely to die for!!  I wanted to keep eating but was so full I had to take half of it with me.  And the Thai iced tea was perfect for cooling the 8 heat of the soup and duck.  Such a wonderful experience!  Next time hubby is out of town I know where I'm going!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  I was on a work trip and I was very pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this place.  Had a bunch of different dishes and one was better than the next.  Plus they have an extensive wine list and everything is very affordable.  A must go!!!"}
{"text":"A culinary extravaganza, one of the best Thai meals I have ever had.  DELICIOUS, can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so I can return."}
{"text":"In Vegas? 

Stop gambling your life away, and Go Here NOW!

I recommend the entire Northern menu."}
{"text":"First time here, wanted to see what was all the commotion about the restaurant. For sure, they didn't fail. The service was great, attentive, and on point with ordering. The food was delicious!!  Ordered the Pananng Curry, Sa-tay, and the finished off with the mango sticky rice  too good. Have to give to it to em."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the setting. We took a cab from the hotel and the staff called a cab to takes us back. You're in and out of the restaurant.

The food is very good. We ordered the prawns in blanket, beef satay, and chicken wing stuffed with ground pork. The prawns were excellent and the satay was very good. (Not dry as satays can sometimes be.) The chicken wing was good but not as good as it looked in the description.

For mains I had the Khao soi braised short rib. It was excellent, the meat was tasty and tender and the noodle were flavorful. The curry sauce was great. Be sure to mix in the lime, onion, and noodles for full flavor. I also tried the scallops with garlic, cilantro, and pepper. They were well cooked and for someone that doesn't love cilantro, i found the taste very satisfying.

It's excellent food and probably the best in Vegas. I guess I'm spoiled because I have Topaz Thai in Belleville, NJ as my comparison."}
{"text":"Best Thai place on this side of the country.  I've been going to Lotus for over 5 years now and every time I swear it gets better.  From the friendly staff to the amazing food, you cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! This is another of our \"must eats\" when in Vegas. The Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles is the best I've ever tasted! Make reservations early for this place. It fills up fast especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam really lives up to they hype. 

We had a 5:30p reservation. We arrived at 5:20p and there was already a huge crowd at the door. Now the 5 minute reservation window makes sense. 

We ordered a number of items and each one was delicious. How often can I say that? The thai iced tea isn't as sweet as at other Thai restaurants. The duck curry was amazing. I always order it at Thai places and this was one of the best. My Dad isn't big on eating out and he enjoyed this restaurant. That's saying a lot. 

I also loved all the framed photos of famous people on the walls. It is so fitting for a Vegas establishment. I spotted Alton Brown (on the wall)!  

Lotus of Siam is a must try!"}
{"text":"I hit this place up for lunch while at a convention in Vegas.  It was recommended by a few people so I figured I would give it a shot.  Some of the best Thai food I've had.  This is a no frills type of establishment.  Great food, solid service, but little ambiance.  I would certainly recommend this place and would go back. However, getting back to the convention hall was quite the experience.  After waiting for about 30 minutes for a cab, the hostess felt so bad she sent one of the kitchen's employees to drive us back.  That was above and beyond service."}
{"text":"Have the crispy garlic shrimp.  Duck curry is nice as well.   Do not do the lunch buffet,  go a la carte. 
Located in a nondescript strip mall and services is so so especially the hostess and the reservations.   Overcome and enjoy the authentic food.  It brought me back to Bangkok if only for a little while."}
{"text":"Very good food. Pad Thai was very tasty and flavorful. Line was out the door on a Thursday. I ordered for pick up so I didn't have the chance to dine in. However, the place looked very welcoming inside with a large wine cellar in the front."}
{"text":"Love their food here. The line is always so long for a table, so I've gotten takeout here twice now. We tried a lot off their menu since we had a large group of people, but the highlights for me was their garlic prawns and panang curry. I still want to go back to try some of their other dishes, but this is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and craving Thai."}
{"text":"Lotus is my favorite Thai place in the US!!! Whenever my bf takes me there, we eat for four people.LOL We always order crab fried rice, khao soi and pad see ew. Everything here is good, but we want to find the fourth must have dish that goes well with the above three dishes. :D"}
{"text":"This is probably the priciest Thai food restaurant I've eaten at. But if I had to rate based solely on the food, this place was incredible. 
My favorite was the Tom Kah Kai. It had an intense spice and was slightly sour, something I would not expect in this soup. 

Like everyone else, I tried the drunken noodles with soft shell crab and it was sooooo good. The fried fish cake had a lovely lemongrass flavor and the penang sauce with the crispy duck was very flavorful. 

I think I'll stop by everytime I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place really does have great Thai food as well as an extensive wine list. I just wish the portions were a tad larger for the price."}
{"text":"Make a reservation before you come! This place has good food but it's not worth the one hour wait. This place has greatly expanded since I came a few years ago but the wait time is still the same.

The garlic prawns and crispy duck panang curry are just tries!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in Vegas the garlic prawns delish the curry the drunken noodles good food and great portion and price"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a long time. Get the crispy duck!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food I have ever had.  If you visit or live in Vegas, this is a must visit. I would recommend not getting anything above a five in spiciness. Gotta get the soup, it is to die for."}
{"text":"Alliance Mental Spec., Dr. suba and staff were very cortious and kind.  I would recommend this clinic highlt"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas.  Don't let the outside fool you."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai food in Vegas... New location on flamingo in the heart of the strip! Garlic prawns are still the go to dish here.. So off the hinges! Cripsy duck Penang drunken noodles be on hit also! Just gotta experience it for yourself... Treat yourself don't cheat yourself!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. What an amazing restaurant. The food so delicious and tasty. This is by far the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Came here after a horrendously long ride to Vegas because we were starving. Very nice dining area, nice servers, but it's not the best Thai food I've had. We ordered the beef jerky and pepper chicken wings as appetizers; the jerky was a bit tough and our server suggested we needed to eat it with our hands because the knife wasn't cutting it. Literally. So we did -- the chicken wings weren't amazing but they were tasty. I had the phad thai and it was A-OK, as the stars have indicated. However, I wouldn't mind giving this place another visit."}
{"text":"Yeah - this place is the bomb.
Perfect food.  Good service, great wine list.
The sausage with fried rice is not to be missed.  It explodes in the mouth.
Amazing selection of German wines.
Destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic; well worth the trip away from the strip. I live in LA and eat Thai food almost weekly, and Lotus of Siam is better than anything else I've had in the US."}
{"text":"I've eaten at all of the major restaurants in town and this is still the only one that is a \"must have\" for me if I only have 1 meal in Vegas. It's a true gem and no one I've ever taken here has ever been disappointed which I can't say for the likes of Guy Savoy. The two standouts are the Tom Kom Gai soup and the mango and sticky rice dessert!"}
{"text":"Pros: super friendly staff, great quality food, fresh ingredients, efficient busboys

Cons: small waiting area, super small portions, way overpriced 

Tip: call way ahead for reservations (even like a day or two before) or else be prepared to wait... We went on a Thursday evening like 6:30ish, an hour after opening, only waited 30 mins... Can only imagine if we showed up later!"}
{"text":"We were told the wait for our table for 2 would be a 45-65 minute wait on a Saturday, about 8pm. We were seated in under 30. 
We started with the Spicy Wings, the Tom Yum Koon soup and the Thai Salad.
The wings were fabulous- we could have eaten plate after plate all night. 
The shrimp were wonderfully delicate in the Tom Yum Soup. 
We agreed we could have just drunk the peanut dressing for the Thai salad on its own.
And the Crispy Duck Panang style. Perfection. The duck was melt in your mouth tender, with that crispy skin as a beautiful balance. We ordered it as a 3 for spice, and it was a perfect build for me, though my hub said he would have it as a 4 or 5 next time for the kick. 
My hub's Thai Coffee had a nice, rich flavor that was not drowned in cream. My Thai Iced Tea was the same.
This will be one of our go to places for Vegas. 
Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Food  delicious and spicy.  Service was quick and the place was real busy.  Had multiple curry dishes along with noodle dishes.  The appetizers were typical, nothing special."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam never fails. Located in a nondescript shopping center a mile or so from the strip, LoS has become a staple for every Vegas visit. Personally, I love their spring rolls and their Panang curry- perhaps the best Thai I've had in the U.S.! Prepare to wait if arriving during peak hours- also be advised that their spice scale (1-10) climbs very quickly!"}
{"text":"Thai food. mmmmhmmmmm, this is one of the better thai restaurants that i've been to in the States. I live in the Bay Area so there is lots of thai food, but coming here to this hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere to eat was a delight. 

Definitely recommend people to come here, even though it is off the strip."}
{"text":"It's Thai food. I have had this in about 105 restos, and to me, they're pretty much all the same. The atmosphere was different, not stuffy or anything, so don't expect that even though this is a famous restaurant , it's not at all bourgeois.
The food we ordered was from the Chef's special. The Nim Prok dip wasn't that great. It was a dip for various veggies and pork rinds.
The salt and pepper prawns were very good, and the panang curry was good too.
Do you notice that I am repeating the word \"good?\"
Well, for the price, it is super $$$ for the main entrees.
The only thing that pretty much redeemed it, was the sticky rice and mango.
At $8 a pop, it was worth it.
Also, my bf has tried Tom Yum soup all over the country (the best being in Boston..) he said this tops it. So there's that review.
If you have family in town, bring them here. If you're having a date night..go to The King and I or Archie's.

***Make reservations...unless you want to wait in this fabulous area. (Sarcasm here)"}
{"text":"I'm glad that Lotus was finally able to parlay their original success into a much nicer location! I remember the days when I could walk in at lunch and have to wait 5, maybe 10 minutes, to sit down. Well, as is the case with all ridiculously amazing restaurants that meet that sinister enemy called hype, that doesn't quite happen anymore.

Still, gotta take advantage of what is available to you. Yes, I literally booked a reservation two months in advance for Lotus. Yes, I also waited 14 months to come back to Lotus. YOU BET YOUR ASS I WAS FEENING FOR SOME LOTUS IN MY LIFE.

Having been here enough times, the key to Lotus is this: DO NOT get dishes you can get somewhere else (yeah, don't be ordering that Pad Thai with beef that you could get at your local Thai restaurant). Lotus serves a plethora of dishes that you simply cannot order at any other Thai restaurant. Keep that in mind, and you'll have an amazing time here. If you want to be basic, then don't be surprised when you get basic results.

As such, I am very thankful that all my friends completely deferred to me to make the right calls on what to eat. Of course I'll make the right call, I went to the old location so much that might as well have set up a tent in there! Quick rundown of food:
1. Panang Curry with Crispy Duck: The BEST DISH on the menu. I knew this would get demolished quickly, so I made sure to order two for my very hungry table. If you come to Lotus and don't order this, why did you come here???
2. Khao Soi with Braised Short Rib: I've actually never had this before this particular trip, but it seemed like a really good dish in theory. In theory was confirmed in actuality. I am definitely making this a repeat dish!
3. Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab: Another old favorite of mine, but BETTER. This version had BY FAR the crispiest soft shell crab ever. Let me tell y'all, I was IN HEAVEN.
4. Crab Fried Rice: Even basic dishes like fried rice is good! Not something I order frequently, but we needed a rice dish to balance out everything else.
5. Garlic Prawns: Their famous garlic prawns really don't need much selling. Just make sure you don't forget to order it.

Service here was impeccable. Lotus knows they're the best Thai restaurant in the city and arguably the country, and they make sure you have a wonderful experience here.

I also want to give a special shoutout to Lotus for their gluten-free menu. My girlfriend can't eat gluten, but Thai food is usually safe. Well, not only does Lotus have you covered, they have an entire two-sided menu for it. And yes, it is VERY extensive. Just don't be like my girlfriend who didn't realize there was another side to the menu until after we ordered lmao. Don't worry, she had another dish and loved it!

Didn't need to park since we took Lyft here. But there is an extensive parking lot here, should you need it.

Bottom line, I would literally come to Vegas SOLELY for Lotus of Siam. I'm over Vegas in general, especially the clubs. But Lotus will never ever get old!"}
{"text":"I know I've reviewed this place before, but it was so long ago that another review had to be merited. Besides, soft shell crab pad kee mao is good, but in terms of actual exoticness it's not really all that exotic.

The big problem is two-fold because I'm almost never here on a weekday. They only do lunch on weekdays, and I'm not dealing with that line for dinner time (and let's be honest, no one actually plans dinner in Vegas if you're gonna go out). EXCEPT LAST TIME I WAS HERE ON FRIDAY AT NOON. Sorry Tacos El Gordo, I love you much but my lunch choice that day was not a hard decision to make.

The reason you go to lunch is simple...you walk in with zero wait. At least that's what's happened the only two times I've been here! And the thing about Lotus is this...it is unquestionably the best Thai restaurant in the city of Las Vegas and arguably the best in the entire country. So you don't go in there with the intention of getting the basic options. Unless for some reason you are a basic person, in which case I hope the gods have mercy on your soul.

My \"get all the options you can't get anywhere else\" principle truly applies here. My friends were just like...dude, have at it, we trust you. Well, here's the list:

1. Crispy duck with penang curry: OMG IT'S THE BEST!
2. Soft shell crab pad kee mao (again): I know it's a tad basic, but hey it was really good last time. Besides, you don't really see soft shell crab on pad kee mao anywhere else...so don't judge me! Next time though...sea bass pad kee mao. Because of this next item.
3. Sea bass with chili sauce: Anyone that knows me knows I'm the biggest sea bass homer there is. This was so freaking good!
4. Chicken pad thai: Ok fine we got the most basic thing you can possible get. But that's because my friend says it's his favorite dish to cook and he wants to see how every restaurant cooks it since it's always different depending on the cook. He approves!

Yeah, everyone was satisfied. I think I know a thing or two about decent Thai food options here lol. And the great thing is that because the menu is so ridiculously deep, I could come here 5 times and never order the same combination of items. 

Only problem is actually finding time to come here again. I ain't trying to mess with that weekend line bruh."}
{"text":"This was highly rated but I was not too impressed that Anthony Bourdain also chose this as his top Vegas off the strip Asian restaurant. There may be limited selections possibly in Vegas but my dish was watery and lacking depth. Catfish was boiled and it would have been tastier seared for a bit before being added to the broth. Veggies were not seasoned...

If you come here you have to order all the fried things to meet the five star reviews to be honest. Big groups were eating the greasiest choices and they looked tastier

Seattle has better Thai for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here based off of the tv recommendation \"best thing I ever ate.\" I can't remember the dishes name that was featured on that show, but it was okay. Not great but definitely not the best thing I ever ate. The rest of our meal though, was fantastic! I guess it was my fault for listening to a tv personality and having expectations for a dish I probably wouldn't normally order. Staff was friendly and very attentive, which I appreciate immensely. Loved how unassuming the place was. The chef is a James Beard award winner but when you walk up to the restaurant you DEFINITELY would not assume that. No need for a fancy building for this Vegas hot spot, once inside the space was expansive and was PACKED. Definitely worth leaving the strip for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"If God owned a Thai restaurant, it'd serve food just like this.  Don't be fooled by the location.  It's in a run-down strip mall next to a wig outlet (seriously), but the food is unbelievable.  Their menu is huge, so I can't even begin to give a comprehensive review, but everything I've had ranged from very good to phenomenal.  It has a reputation for being the best Thai restaurant in North America.  I'd suggest not going in with that expectation, as it's setting the bar pretty damn high, but Lotus of Siam is definitely an excellent dinner spot.  They also have a lunch buffet that I thought was a good meal, but a step down from dinner on the quality meter.

One specific recommendation: the spicy chicken wings make a great appetizer."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Thai food but the family wan't it while we were here Vegas. So I went with the flow and we arrived at 7:30 and the place was packed. Thank goodness for reservations!
When you first arrive it is located on a strip mall and very easy to find. We entered and the place looked kind of small I thought, then while we had to wait for table thought I would go to the bar and have a drink to wait. The place another dining section. While passing through they had a wine room I thought wow! 
Had a drink and looked at the table to see what other diners were eating and the smell of the dishes were making my mouth watery. I was thinking may not be bad at all to try Thai!
We sat down and ordered:
Green chicken curry= very good
Stuffed chicken wings= very good ( by the way the kids took it down to the bone)
Shrimp Thai salad= awesome 
Some kind of fish( was flaky and a little kick of spice) that was very good
Lobster ( almost like Cantonese style but different seasoning) that was good
I have to say I had a bad experience long time ago in a Thai restaurant and never tried again but coming here and giving it a shot, wow! I am a fan now of Thai, hope when I get back Jersey I can find a place like this. Love the fish sauce and Thai pepper condiment if you like spice that is it."}
{"text":"The place  was packed.  Service  was slow.  There was a 45 minutes  wait. Prices  were a little  higher  than normal.  Desert was below average and some of portions were small. It came highly recommended  . Soup was good with lots of vegetables"}
{"text":"I dont get the 4 star reviews.  If this isnt a perfect dining experience, what could possibly make the grade?   I love Thai food, have been to many restaurants, have studied it and cooked it.  This was quite simply the best Thai food I have ever experienced, by a mile, served at a fair price promptly, hot, by a friendly staff.  You can choose anything and it is fantastic,  When you go, try things off the Northern Menu for a unique and rare experience.  Someone here on Yelp said crispy duck in curry is life changing, and he/she is right.  We paired it with Panang, our favorite curry.  Breathtaking.  Crispy garlic shrimp were also mind altering.  Tom Ka Gai soup perfect.  Spicy garlic wings perfect. Scallops in red curry perfect. Khao Soi (Northern) perfect. Spicy seafood fried rice perfect.  My only regret is I know not when I will be able to go again as I live elsewhere.  If I lived there I would go several times a week.  Try it.  There are a lot of restaurants on the Strip that could learn a thing or two about non-pretentious fantastic food served at a fair price for a good value.  Its just off the Strip, easy to get to.  Go."}
{"text":"Where to begin?

I have had thai tea so many times at so many places and yet I realized that I had NEVER had thai tea in my life because what I had at Lotus of Siam can not be compared to a y of the drinks I had had in my life. \"Even the drinks are that good?\" I thought. Yes even the drinks were that good.

I went with the #12 stuffed chicken wings, DAYUM, and Northern dishes I. Nam-Prik-Ong as  an appetizer. Whoa. It is as good as it seems on Best Thing I Ever Ate. Then we got Pad Thai, which was awesome! And better than any pad thai you have had (I do sugest that you explore the menu though) The ladies next to us ordered the drunken noodles with seafood, geebus I have never seen it  look that good. So Pad And Red Curry Beef. I do not have the vocabulary to express how good the food is. It is better than any Thai food you have ever eaten. Ever. Even Thai people that have recommended restauratns that they think are great were not places that can touch Lotus of Siam.

PAY ATTENTION HERE. Make reservations even if it only two people. Reservationa must be made a day ahead. We had to wait for an hour for a table for two. some people were told that a table for two would take 2 hours. A three time James Beard award winner is just that busy. Let that sink in 3 time James Beard award winner..."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly suggested to visit while we were in Vegas.  Definitely make a reservation because they were packed!  This was some of the best Thai food I have ever had in my life!  Everything we ate was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  We started out with bacon wrapped prawns in a wrapper, fried with a sweet and sour sauce.  We also had  the Crispy Rice appetizer with onion, mint, pork, it was super spicy and I can handle spice, but it was delicious!  We then got Red Curry Tofu, Pad Thai, and Peppercorn seared Beef with Rice.  These were all so tasty but I will say that the Beef was my favorite!  It was savory and the meat was so tender.  Everything here on a spice level of 1-10 is very spicy...we got a 5 and it was hot!  The waitstaff is great as well as the food.  Although this restaurant is in a strip mall off of the Strip, every cab driver will know when you say the name of Lotus!  When you are in Vegas this is a must!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! I  had the khoa soi with chicken and loved it. It has quite a mild coconut broth flavor. My wife had the Musaman curry that had more of an authentic deep spice/flavor that I enjoyed it a lot. In real life the serving size was much bigger than photos show. We arrived exactly at 5:30 PM as the restaurant was opening for dinner. We only had a five minute wait and food came out very quickly. By the time we left at 6:30pm all the tables were full and it looks like a lot of people were waiting for a table. Overall it was very good authentic food that I recommend."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying that I have only really eaten Thai food two or three times but I have heard about this place so much that I figured I needed to try it.  Since I don't usually eat Thai, I don't really know what to look for or order or how good Thai is supposed to taste versus bad Thai.  

Went here with reservations and after about a 10 minute wait was seated.  The server was very attentive and knowledgeable and helped us in explaining what was popular and what other items were.  It just so happened the most popular dishes were the most expensive dishes.  Unfortunately we didn't get any of those but did order 4 other dishes and some wine.  The wine was really good and paired well with the food.  The food was good but not anything I would really write home about.  That may be because I'm not used to the flavors but I just thought most of it was eh.  It wasn't bad, just not amazing.  We ordered some kind of sausage which had a spicy, just alright flavor but seemed dry, a spicy and sour soup which was at the same time one of the spiciest and one of the most sour food II have ever eaten, which was very interesting, a green curry, chicken vermicelli which was good but seemed a bit bland as well, and then a roasted pork stew over rice which was great although came in a very small portion.  

Maybe I should've tried what they are known for but then again I wanted to try a variety of food.  That being said, I enjoyed myself and the restaurant but I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"It's not a trip to Vegas without hitting up Lotus of Siam!  They have the best beef rad na I've ever had and you can't beat their curries and sticky rice.

No lies, the strip mall it's in is absolutely scary and deserted.  I was sure I was in the wrong place the first time, but it's there, and the inside is lovely.

I don't tend to order wine here, because I usually come here for a good meal at a cheap price, to give my wallet a break while in Vegas, but they have an extensive wine room that maybe I'll check out sometime.

Truthfully, no matter what review I could write here wouldn't compare to the hundreds of articles that have been written by the best food critics around (for example, read Jonathan Gold's reviews of the restaurant), so just trust me that it's amazing!  Absolutely worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"I live in sgv so I'm exposed to lots of Thai food. Lotus of Siam is a good, but not great. I had the crispy duck, which is one of their specialty. It taste good but not good enough to worth $25 dollars. I don't think I'll come back, unless I have a party that wanted to come."}
{"text":"Blown away.  Seriously.  If you're looking for some sort of haute cuisine experience, you should probably look somewhere else, but if you want as-good-as-it-gets Thai, this is the place.  Don't be put off by the seedy exterior, get in line at about 5:15 p.m. and enjoy. 

Thanks Mr. Belushi for the recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food but small portion and charged 18% tip if your group over  5 and more including all ages babies. My 2 years and 5weeks babies were charged for 18% tip. This restaurant is the best Thai restaurant in Vegas but their service is not the best for customers. Enjoy their great small portion foods but do not expect any service."}
{"text":"The food was \"5 star worthy\", but I chose to give 4 stars because the wait is EXTREMELY long. I highly recommend calling ahead for reservations (if you can get through). The wine list is a mile long, for you wine drinkers, and the portions are a little small. I will say however, that the egg rolls are the best egg rolls I've ever had! Service was so-so. Andddd the last part is, it's off the strip, and you'll need a taxi to and from."}
{"text":"The chef of this place has bee described by the NY Times as the person with the best Thai restaurant in the country.  Really?  Yes.  Really.  In the middle of nowhere, in a strip mall in the desert?  Yes.  

But no worries.  The chef knows this.  If you're here for a great Thai meal, the chef will come out to check you out.

The sad thing about this place is that on a week day at lunchtime 90% of the people in the dining room (mostly locals from offices close by) were having the lunch buffet, something you can find in Ohio or any small town USA-ville.  Jesus Prakakorn NEVER gets any respect in his own home.

Obviously order off the menu.

The best Thai laab (we did the raw beef and pork), seafood soup, and curry ever.  Their wine list is so well-curated that the folks in the Mosel valley would be jealous of their encyclopedic riesling options.  Their rieslings are top-notch.  And it did pair so well with the spicy Thai food.

5 stars at every level.

The chef needs to come back to Thai-town in Los Angeles.  There'd be 90% of us ordering off the menu and only 10% in the buffett line."}
{"text":"I went here after a long day.  Now, the outside of the place, parking lot and surrounding areas are less than desirable.  However, the inside was a stark contrast.  It was very nice, bright and very clean.  I would definitely make a reservation.  The food was really good and tasty.  We had the Pad thai, Garlic Prawns, combination fried rice and beef pad prig king.  The beef was awesome.  Very good flavor and just the right amount of heat.  The worst dish was the fried rice but most Thai places don't make fried rice that well so it was not a deal breaker...the wait staff was very good and efficient...overall a very good meal was had"}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve 2012. Great service. Unbelievable food. Grouper with drunken noodle was amazing. The coconut shrimp soup was fabulous. The fried rice with sausage appetizer should not be missed -- some of the best flavors I've ever had. Wine list is amazing. Get a good dry Riesling.

I plan to come here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been to Bangkok Phuket and Lotus Siam definitely measures up if not better ! Every dish we tried was very good.  Very authentic !  The Tom Yum soup is the white tom yum cooked to perfection with herbs spices and not from a paste from the jar!  The glass noodle , papaya and seafood salad was awesome! Sour spicy salty with lots of veggies and fresh seafood!  Pad Thai and crab meat fried rice was great to take the spicy edge off! Larb and spicy ground beef with basil was fantastic ! 
Great experience ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy beef salad and it was pretty good.  Could have been spicier, but I asked them for more spice and they brought me some.  The fried dumplings were good also."}
{"text":"Best Thai food by far in Vegas. Drunken noodle Seabass and spicy Thai beef salad is a must. You won't regret this choice whether you're a tourist or local. Best in town"}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5 for good service and good food (1 star off for the imitation crab). 

We arrived at 530 with no reservation on a Monday evening and were seated right away (when we left around 620 people were waiting at the door).

Overall the price is very reasonable ($10 for most dishes). My friend got the cashew nut chicken (7/10 spicy left a very strong almost burning aftertaste which is amazing). Overall the dish was great (4/5).

I had the drunken noodles with seafood. It was like pad see ew (delicious!) with a variety of seafood on top. The shrimp and squid were pretty good but the imitation crab (the biggest part of the dish) was a let-down. If I order that again I would specifically ask to leave the crab off. (3/5) 

I'm excited to go back and try even more on their expansive menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, Authentic Thai food! Service is gracious, as they let us sit down for lunch even though we didn't know they closed at 2:30pm, and we came in at 2:28pm. (Oops.) Everything was delicious. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"One of the best meals ive had in vegas.  Food, service, host staff were all great.  Plenty of amazing dishes in the 12/ plate price range.  Since others mentioned the wait I'll mention that the place was packed when we arrived but the still sat us on time for our reservation"}
{"text":"Amazing! Read reviews of garlic prawns & crispy duck. Blown away! I'm not a big duck fan but they sauce was amazing. Glad we split everything between four of us. We got almost every appetizer they offer. All perfect! The Thai tea is yummy! This is our new go to place when we have guests."}
{"text":"This was a must try for us after watching it on an episode of Munchies. So overall it was pretty yummy but the reason I give it 4 stars was because I had no veggies in my Pad se ew! I was asked if I wanted chicken,  beef or seafood and I stated neither, I just wanted veggies. I seriously could count on one hand the pieces of veggies. Anyway,  the crispy duck was pretty darn good. We asked for the curry on the side and that was a good choice,  I think otherwise it wouldn't have been as crispy. Won ton soup was good, and the hubs inhaled his Pad Thai. Definitely we'll be back and try something else of the menu."}
{"text":"This is the greatest wine list in Las Vegas, and the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to by a wide margin. Located in a dumpy strip mall off of Sahara Boulevard, it serve astonishingly good Thai food; in fact, the chef won the James Beard award last year! Best of all is an award winning wine list where many of the wines are priced below retail. We put our group in the waiter's hands, and he delivered eight or ten terrific appetizers and shared entrees, each better than the last. I took the opportunity to pillage the wine list, and although some of my selections couldn't be found, we ended up with some stunners. Where else can you find an affordable Clos de Tart from a great year? That bottle alone was over $1000 on the list at Picasso, a fifth that here."}
{"text":"I recently went here as I am living in Las Vegas for the next year. Friends suggested it for my buddies birthday. I am not big on Thai food but I have to say this place takes the cake, way better then the couple other places I went. I got the drunken noodles with soft shell crab at a level 2 because I am not into spicy foods and it still had a little cook to the juice. 

My friend got a number 8 and was in tears, haha. I guess it goes from 0-10 so see what you can handle if that is what you like. The service is good, when you walk in you feel like its a small place because the lobby/waiting area is tiny but plenty of space in the dining area. I highly recommend it and will go back, when I leave my plate will be empty and my belly full and happy."}
{"text":"What a little gem in the strip mall rough! After being price gouged at our hotel for a day, it was so refreshing to be charged as much for a bottle of wine as a glass would have cost back at the ranch. And the food was thai-rrific! As an aside, I never tire of bad thai puns. No frills ambience, and that's just fine with me."}
{"text":"The best Thai ever! Love this place. A true hidden jem. Best Tom Ka Khi I've ever had."}
{"text":"their khao soi (sp?) dish is awesome! great thai restaurant if you want to eat something off the strip. definitely recommend trying other things besides your typical thai food (pad thai, pad se ew, etc)."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my wife last weekend and heard about this must go, best in country Thai restaurant. I will say that our first impression of this place was not good at all. It's not the unassuming building or the location. It's the buffet lunch that they put out there. DON'T try the buffet lunch. Again, DON'T get the buffet lunch. It's terrible. We were there around 12:30 on a Friday and  the steam table trays were half empty. They also took their time replenishing the food, which was slightly better than mediocre, which is not saying much. Service for the buffet was also terrible. Seems like the wait and kitchen staff were more intent on taking care of the menu customers than the buffet customers. I don't understand why restaurants do this. If you are going to offer a buffet, at least keep it hot and full at all times even if the food is not good. If we didn't know about this place, the buffet experience would have turn us off completely and we would never come back. I am tempted to give this place a 3 star except that the food off the menu was so much better and a better representation of this place.

We came back again with great trepidation to try out the menu. Our buffet experience was so bad that we almost didn't come back. We were glad to give them one more chance. They have a great menu and offered northern dishes that we don't see a lot. Food came out quickly and the wait staff was always attentive (unlike the Buffet). Garlic Prawns were fantastic as were the sour rice salad, Khao Soi and the other dishes that we ordered. Their food certainly had more depth to it than what you would find at a typical place.

Ultimately, was this the best Thai restaurant in the nation, probably not. The lunch buffet was a waste of time and money. It shouldn't even be offered for a restaurant like this, where the menu is the gem. However, the menu item were certain unique and good enough that we will come back next time we are in town. for the menu items, NOT the buffet."}
{"text":"I would give this local treasure a 4.5.  We hit up this spot every time we go to Vegas 

Wait:  lines are super long esp on weekends but it's worth it.  Pro tip call 7 days in advance and get reservations.  They will text you when your table is ready.  If you call same day they rarely pick up

Food
- best authentic Thai food you will ever experience.  The depth of their menu is impressive.  The food is amaze balls
- Khao Soi with braised beef:  crunchy noodles & soft yellow egg noodles in a curry sauce is a great texture juxtaposition. the braise beef so soft it's to die for.  
- Tom Kha Kai soup:  medley of hot sour and coconut soup served piping hot with soft chicken slices.  Very good broth.  Can't go wrong with this dish IMHO
- Druken noodles fried duck- small portions for $27 Greasy don't know why so much hype over this dish.
Tip:  Thai ice tea average
 
Parking:  big lot it's free.  Most taxis know how to get here.

Cons
-  over the years they've really jacked up the price slowly
- portions smallish considering it's an Asian place
- service slow got our check wrong

Still a great food experience and lots of options to try.  Get reservations and save yourself a headache."}
{"text":"Let's just say that I went for the hype and I was very disappointed.  I ordered the soft shell drunken noodles and a steak with peanut sauce (I don't remember the name of the dish) and for appetizers, I ordered the stuffed chicken wings.  The food was very bland and the word bland doesn't exist in Thai food.  The wings had absolutely no flavor, the drunken noodles also had no flavor but the steak was decent.  To top it off, the food was cold.  I also had the coconut ice cream with sticky rice and mangos and that was ok.  Also, service sucked, waitress took a long time to take our orders and was rushing us out.  Will I go back, absolutely not.  There are far better places for Thai.  This restaurant is all hype and severely over priced."}
{"text":"Came to this place ready to be impressed after all of the hype. Maybe it was the high expectations but we were not too impressed. Great wine list but the food wasn't too impressive. Had the yellow and coconut/tomatoe/duck curry. Food was fine but did not live up to expectations. Veggies in the curry were raw."}
{"text":"We made reservation to this place a month prior and was able to score a table for 3 at 6:30pm on a saturday night. Good thing we were able to do that otherwise the wait is 2 hours on the shady side of Vegas where there's nothing else to do around.

Location is odd as it's in a very empty looking strip mall. 

The doors for dinner open at 5:30 and when we arrived there was a line out the door trying to get in. We were seated within 2 mins of checking in. 

The interior reminds me of a 80s oriental style restaurant, but I came here for the food after reading rave reviews by Jonathan Gold and seeing a special on Parts Unknown (Vegas).

The place was already packed inside, a lot of large groups (family style type service). 
The wall had a lot of photos of well known celebrities and celebrity chefs.Also had a wall of numerous awards.

We order a bowl of soup to share and a couple of dishes (Green curry chicken and pineapple fried rice). All three dishes had the right balance in taste. all very excellent compared to some of the best Thai places I've been to.

Price is very reasonable. 

Service was very attentive even though the place was busy. 

Would definitely come back and try some of their more well known dishes of Northern Thailand but would def make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"We were here about a year ago and I still remember how good our meal was. I remember that I had something from the 'Northern' part of the menu. I wanted to get another bowl of this right AFTER stuffing ourselves at the Wynn buffet! So that tells you how good the soup was because the Wynn buffet is so good! My husgand had the pad thai and it was good but he was playing it good and there's a lot of places that do good pad thai."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed with this joint after all the hype...

The service was awesome, the ambiance was fine. But the food? I wouldn't go out of my way to return. I ordered the chicken soup -Tom Kah Kai , the flavors were a delight. However I think it had been sitting on the warmer half the evening ergo the chicken was rubbery and over cooked. The garlic shrimps I had were far too greasy. It was completely unappetizing.
My other half had the nam prik ong. It was alright, but he was unsure as to why it was the best dish Ming Tsai ever had. Mr. Man was completely underwhelmed... We've had Pok Pok (in Portland, OR) sticky rice, sticky rice at home, and many other restaurants. But here? It wasn't very good. Just sticky and cold. Only good for a bonding agent. 
I would not recommend a return visit. It seems like they're just trading on their reputation."}
{"text":"What the f@@k! This place is damn good. We ordered 4 plates: stuffed chicken wings, crispy duck, musaman curry and the larb."}
{"text":"In the middle of the backside of an empty run down strip mall is the best Thai food I have ever had. Open the door and you are transported to a large bustling restaurant, nice big bar, and comfortable seating. Great energy.  The staff are all super friendly and attentive. 

The menu is wide and deep with more than five types of Tom Yum you can order from, and a long list of Thai salads not off a traditional Americanized Thai menu.  

Definitely order from the northern menu. Khao Soi (it is awesome) or one of the Nam Prik dips. Crispy duck Penang is off the hook. The Penang is very creamy and rich. Soft shell crab with drunken noodles was good but nothing special. Would have been better if the soft shell wasn't battered and deep fried. 

Been to Vegas 10+ times and this is the first restaurant that will be a \"must visit\" every time I return."}
{"text":"Sooooo glad we made a reservation.  I recommend you do too.

I can't remember the names of the things we ordered, but everything was delicious, like plate-licking delicious.

We had the beef jerky-like appetizer, which was excellent.  I ordered Panang and it was fantastic.  

For dessert I had the coconut ice cream with sticky rice.  Yum.  My friend ordered the sticky rice with mango.  Also yum.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to say 5 stars for the crispy rice dish, and 2 stars for the jack fruit curry (it was interesting, but really not what I wanted), 3 stars for the drunken noodles, and 4 stars for the crispy duck on top of the noodles... It's a wash. 

Reservations are highly recommended! I made reservations for 2 a few weeks in advance, and they actually said that my first choice for time was unavailable. When i got the restaurant, a few parties of 2 walked in and were told that the wait was 45 minutes (!?). 

The service was prompt and the menu is overwhelming! I liked that they have Isaan food. However, I think that I may have ordered the wrong thing...I was intrigued by the jack fruit curry, but it was ok...It was really watery and more like tomato water with herbs :( The drunken noodles were ok. The crispy duck on top was really good, though, which sort of made the dish, but the noodles on their own were average. 

I do have to say that the crispy rice dish, though, was FANTASTIC! Very flavorful, in all the right ways. 

They say that it's spicy. I got a 3 (out of 10). I can handle spicy food, but they warned us that 3 or 4 packed a lot of heat. The crispy rice was spicy, but the drunken noodles and jack fruit curry could have had a bit more spiciness."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and atmosphere.  We went here for lunch.  Menu had extensive selections but we ordered what we usually have at Thai restaurants.  For appetizer we had tempura.  Generous portion, especially shrimps, and crispy and delicious.  My chicken and shrimp pad Thai was so fresh and flavorful, one of the best.  My sister had panang curry and brother-in-law pad se ewi.  They said their dishes were delicious as well.  I will definitely return and try their other dishes, especially Northern Thai menu, whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great example of Thai, especially its specialty dishes from the more Northern region of Thailand. Kind service, ridiculous wine selection that is to die for when paired with Thai. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food and very rude staff.

This place blows after wait of 40 min just to be seated my expectations were very high. However, the servers are rude and take for ever to even bring out food and the price of the food does not meet the quality of the food... High prices for nasty take out food. Don't waist your time or your money. Their are several places do eat out rather than this place."}
{"text":"It's all about the garlic prawns! Cooked to perfection and very sizable :) for $21 it better be.

Also ordered the soft shell crab drunk noodle which was good but I've had better sauce on the noodles before but the soft shell crab tasted good and cooked well.

Overall good dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here to try the chili dip that Ming Tsai heralded as the best thing he ever tasted in Las Vegas. Seriously!?! Veggies with a sloppy joe type dip ehhh no thanks. But the rest of the meal was fantastic and made up for the very disappointing dip. We had the papaya salad, crispy rice and green curry. They were all amazing with just the right amount of spice for my palate. 
We did not have reservations and there was an hour wait, they asked for our cell phone number and called us about 50 minutes later. We were downtown and it took us about 15 minutes to get back but they held our table. Service was overall very good. Though this restaurant is in a shady strip mall I would go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and make a reservation otherwise prepare to wait!

Variety is plentiful so be adventurous 
Bring a larger group so you can try more things 
Thai flavors are present and unapologetic so prepare to embrace something different
Off the beaten path but well worth the journey 

Overall thoughts

Wish I could go back there now and try all the things!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Vegas, went with my work family, part of which are Thai (made it a lot easier to order!) I loved everything. Not to mentions the WINE ROOM is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Honestly.... just ok... 
the thai that i have at my building makes the same food.
1st they had some attitude because we came with 2 less people. the server was not nice at all! 
the fried prawn with salt and pepper are very good, as well as the crispy rice... everything else was exactly the same than most of thai restaurants...
i wish they had better staff and better management...

good thai, but we payed 80 each at the end..."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall.  A friend of mine suggested this place, recommended to her by a different friend (the recommender lives in Los Angeles!).  When hubby and I arrived, we were rather dismayed to find ourselves standing outside the rather shabby exterior, flanked by questionable businesses in a sketchy strip mall.  However, all reservations dissipated when spotting the many photos of celebs on the walls and smelling the yummy smells within.  The four of us chose the pad Thai (with chicken), snapper, drunken noodles with tofu, and the northern style sausage.  All were excellent: not drowning in sauce, no bad aftertaste, just flavourful food that made us overeat.  :)  Service was especially good: attentive, patient, yet unobtrusive.  Prices are mid-level (around $12-15/entree) and portions were generous, not ridiculously so.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"After having a lot of Thai food in San Francisco, I've been looking for a go-to place in Las Vegas to get Thai food. Although I am still looking for that place, I have found that I frequent Lotus of Siam quite a bit, but it seems like only when I have visitors in town. Almost everyone knows about Lotus of Siam since it has been featured on The Best Restaurants of LV and a lot of other food shows. So why not a more stars? i think that there is a lot of hype for this place and I guess I just expected more and better. 

If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait as there is almost always a crowd here, both locals and out of towners. If you can, make a reservation so you won't wait too long. I've tried a good number of dishes here and they are good, but not spectacular. For some of the dishes, the prices to me are a bit high for Thai food. I've tried the Paid Thai, Pad See Yew, Beef Salad, drunken noodles, the various curries, garlic prawns, and spicy chicken wings. One word of caution - be prepared for the heat - when they ask you how hot you want, dont go overly crazy. I can handle a lot of heat, but their level 5 is hot enough to enjoy. Any hotter and you wouldn't be able to taste the food. 

Overall, I would go to Lotus of Siam when I am craving Thai food, but don't think that it's the best as many of the other reviews state. I am still looking for my go-to Thai place in LV and hope that I can find it as I have in SF and LA."}
{"text":"Oh my.  Five of us ate dinner here Saturday night, and this was seriously one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas.  We did the Nam Kao Tod and Nam Prik Ong as appetizers, then everyone ordered one dish, which we all shared.  The crispy duck panang (ordered mild) was amazing, I kept returning to that sauce again and again, drizzling it over the sticky rice.  We also had the crab fried rice, garlic prawns, and two Pad Thais, one chicken and one pork.  With Singha's all around, the bill was under $150 before tip, considerably less than the rest of our meals on the trip.  Saipin was cooking that night, as I caught sight of her a few times in the back.  Service was fantastic, friendly and accommodating.  

If you're looking for a fancy place...move along.  But if you're after an unbelievably good meal, this is the place.

I'm ready to book my next Vegas trip just so I can go back."}
{"text":"Always a good time when your here.  We come here a lot after our hockey games.  Tonight was the Chicken Pad Thai experience.  Overall very good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the country and I have been to quite a few in different states.  We used to go for their lunch buffet, when ever we came to Vegas from Los Angeles,  which is no loner available, boo hoo..because you can get little bites of a lot of their dishes that way..we still go for lunch or dinner and order from the menu but it makes it harder because we have to limit our dishes.  If you love Thai..you have to go here..yopu wont be disappointed..great service as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas by far.  Chef Saipin Chutima James Beard Award winner sure knows her tradition and traditional food.  We enjoyed having classic and new dishes from her extensive menu.  Of course we will be back for more.  One of the favourites was the crispy duck (choose any style I am sure they are all great!)."}
{"text":"I almost hesitate in recommending this place because I know it just makes it harder to get a table there.  However, it is no secret.  This restaurant has won national acclaim for its authentic Thai cuisine.  What the restaurant lacks in ambience and location it more than makes up for in food quality and menu.  Extensive selection of Northern/Southern Thai dishes and an impressive wine cellar.  Garlic prawns are amazing, as are whole fish dishes of various preparations.  Spice levels go from 1 (mild) to 10 (hot) and Thai spicy (beyond hot).  Go with a large group and enjoy many different dishes to share.  Reservations are difficult.  If you can't get one, go at 5:00 and wait outside the restaurant.  Most likely you can get a table right when the restaurant opens at 5:30 for dinner."}
{"text":"(Im rating based on the field of buffets)Thai style lunch buffet for only $8.99? Fast-food chains, who? News flash, just in: Curry and I just eloped. All their herbs and spices are potent, they probably have their own garden outside. but then again, this is Las vegas, so their herb and ingredient source is definitely not local, but nevertheless, fresher than the prince of bel air.

Forgive me for my lack of knowledge in thai eats, but deep curry puffs(wontons)? shaking my head, \"yes.\" Well. It'd be better if it was freshly fried out of the oil tank, but it's a buffet, so it's a compromise. Just like their pad Thai noodles are a little bit on the dry side, but still tastes decent. They have a nice and simple selection on their buffet menu, like the ginger tofu dish. They also offer regular menus as well, which I have yet to try.

Many of the workers here are smiley, which in that moment, makes me just want to book a flight to Thailand, now. And yes they're on top of their service. I really adore this place."}
{"text":"Great quality Thai food off of strip with reasonable prices but small portions. They have an extensive menu with great options. I must say the goat curry was win awesome as well as the crispy noodles which surprisingly came in a generous portion. The place has a simple decor. If u are in Las Vegas and want real good food without the formality them definitely try them out. Be careful though as their food tends to be spicier than other Thai restaurants. I like my food spicy and 5 was right on for me. My son got a 6 and it was really spicy."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of this restaurant for years. I was really eager to try them at the new location in the old Roy's. They sunk a good fortune into remodeling the location. They did an amazing job transforming the space into a gorgeous fine dining authentic Thai restaurant, with the glamour and sparkle you'd expect to find in a Las Vegas local eatery gem. We went two weeks after the grand opening at lunch time. My only complaint is just a personal preference. They sat us at the very first table right near the front door and walk way to the kitchen. I personally don't enjoy sitting in that location due to traffic etc. I like to enjoy a meal in a little more private setting. Obviously because this is such a popular well known establishment we had many looky lous gawking at our table even pointing to some of our dishes. 

The service was exceptional as always and the food was TOP NOTCH! Our glasses of water never went half way empty without someone refilling them with the pretty bottles of water at each table. They also were very quick to clear away dishes allowing room for the next course. It was just two of us and we ordered a feast. For our appetizers we started with the mixed vegetable/shrimp tempura, and chicken satay. The tempura was perfectly golden brown and the chicken was flawless as always moist and flavorful. The second course we chose the catfish Tom Klong Pla-krob soup. It was a very well balanced soup with the flavors swirling around in delight. The final course we chose to share the drunken noodles with soft shell crab and the ginger Chilean sea bass. The crab was seasoned and fried to a \"T\" and the noodles were al' dente to slurping perfection. The sea bass was out of this world, delicately light layered with flavorful ginger and sauteed vegetables. 

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this family owned Las Vegas restaurant. I am so happy they have reopened it would be a great injustice to this city to lose such a high quality authentic Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago and I have thought about the Nam Kao Tod every single day since dining here. Take me back."}
{"text":"the service staff is friendly and quick. the food is absolutely delicious. you have to get the crispy fried rice and their garlic black pepper prawns. there is a wait but it's not that bad even during busy times."}
{"text":"Loved the food!!!!! Still craving for their pad Thai!!!!!!
Lovely restaurant off the strip. Had to reserve a week in advance for a group of 8. Arrived at 1930, table was ready and promptly sat. 
We ordered 8 plates to share (beef tartare, chicken pad Thai, tofu curry, duck, papaya salad, house special fried rice, salmon, fried shrimp). All food were super tasty. We took 3/10 for the spiciness and it was just perfect (did not have to add on hot sauce). The price was super cheap compared to restaurants on the strip. For 8 meals, 2 deserts and 2 wine bottles incl. tax and tip = 31.50 US$/per person. Can't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"I fully admit that my secret hero is Anthony Bourdain.  I mean what man doesn't watch his show and secretly wish that he could be transported to some far off land to experience some amazing eatery in a hidden place.  

He seems to wisp in and out of these places with the greatest of ease.  A man who needs no reservations, and seems to have none.  He walks into the seediest of dives and has amazing foods brought to his table.

As I find myself walking across a seedy parking lot on Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas, I close my eyes and say a quick prayer that I will have one of these moments.  Lotus of Siam could easily headline a Las Vegas episode of No Reservations.  The Singha comes to the table, ice cold.  The amazing foods that follow are exactly the way that Tony Bourdain would get them delivered to his table.

Roasted Duck Drunken Noodles

Sear Scallops with Garlic Pepper sauce

Shrimp Pad Thai

Crab Fried Rice

Musaman Curry with Chicken

The menu practically writes itself.  Everything comes to the table and everyone at the table oohs and awes over each dish that gets sampled.  My life may not be as exciting as Bourdain's, but for one meal I got to live like him!"}
{"text":"okay. this was my first vegas thai spot that i just discovered. it is one of the best ive ever had. i live in San Francisco where there are thai restaurants on every block, but this is fan-eff'n-tastic. their fried tofu appetizer is SOOO good. their sauce was amazing. i just wish i can get the recipe for that. 

their seafood drunken noodle & pad thai was HELLA good and i just have no complaints....except for the ghetto plaza its located in. oh and we missed the buffet. boo. def coming back next time for that.

:D"}
{"text":"I remember visiting Lotus of Siam in my pre-Yelp days.  I read all the (Zagat) hype, heard all the praise, and, on more than one occasion, mentioned the reviews of it being the \"Best Thai in North America.\"

All in all, it ended up being a huge letdown and I was embarrassed at bringing a large party of 8 to this restaurant and making reservations one month in advance.  

1) Location - Lotus of Siam is located in the middle of a strip mall and it isn't an easy location for most cabs to find.  The neighborhood is questionable and in the evenings is probably not the safest locale.

2) Decor - reflective of its strip mall location, the interior is nothing special.  There are, however, typical Thai touches (flowers and statues) and plenty of newspaper articles touting it's reputation as a great Thai restaurant.

3) Food - While many reviews talk about the amazing flavors and the incredible tastes, I found everything to be absolutely average.  Given the high expectations, I was obviously disappointed, but even without those expectations, I'd be hard pressed to even call the food good.  All the dishes chosen were \"signature\" dishes recommended by our waiter and each failed to impress.

With every bite I took, I just wondered how the heck the Gourmet magazine food review could be so off and what kool-aid all the reviewers were drinking.  Even now, I can think of a dozen Thai restaurants better than Lotus of Siam and probably only one or two that I've considered worse.  

In the end, as I waited 45 minutes for a cab to pick up our group from the seedy strip mall location, I figured it all must be a tourist trap.  One  stellar review must have spawned the rest or maybe, none of the people who were gushing over Lotus had ever been to a Thai restaurant.  

For the Las Vegas that is home  to the $4.99 Steak and Egg breakfast and the 24 hour buffet, Lotus of Siam may be a revolutionary restaurant.  But for North America??  Lotus of Siam falls amazingly flat."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but it was told that it was going to be the \"best thai food ever.\" It was not the best curry I have ever had, however, the summer rolls (wait, were they spring or summer) were the best I have ever had. Fresh minty deliciousness!!!! 

They also have a daytime buffet that closes early, so I wasn't able to get it (folks in line said NOT to get the buffet), but I wished I had since I would have been able to try more dishes. 

Plus, this joint is only a quick but fun drive from The Strip. I saw a tranny trying to light she/he/their crackpipe in a storefront so I drove around the block a few extra times it was so entertaining! Score."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent! The waitor recommended the crispy duck in pagnang curry and the seabass and drunken noodle and both were excellent. The restaurant is in a small strip mall that's a bit shady. And, we waited about 10 minutes to be able to hail a cab back to the strip. I'd go back again for the food when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular. We ate here a couple years ago, wasn't impressed with it then; decided to give it another try since it had over 3,000 reviews on Yelp, but still didn't change...Nothing special, food tastes like every other Thai restaurant I've been to, and I've eaten at a lot of them since my husband is Thai. 
And service was not that great either. I ordered Thai tea when we were first seated at our table and had to keep asking for it; didn't get it until we were almost done with our meal"}
{"text":"The new location is situated a few miles from the strip and is definitely a lot nicer. When I arrived, there was nearly a two hour wait, which is not uncommon, but thanks to their new lounge seating, we were seated within minutes. The seating is located right near the entrance and is open, therefore, I recommend that you keep that mind, especially if you have a small party.

Our go-to meal is garlic prawns, Chicken Curry, and Pad Thai. They did not and have not disappointed. In fact, they continue to keep the same quality and service for the last 4-5 years that I've been visiting. 

Only issue we had was inability to order wine and beer, but you're able to bring your own! 

They should get their liquor license soon, but nonetheless, this was another great experience. I highly recommend this place to everyone who goes to Vegas, it is a must stop."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good here. The place was packed and it's a fairly large place. Service was good and friendly. The price is a little high for the quality. Overall not a bad dining experience. Will come back. Oh if your a wine drinker they have a good selection."}
{"text":"Roma Deli is the best Italian retaurant in all of Las Vegas.

Its owner, Massimo, is an authentic Italian and authentic server of great food and people. He is not only congenial and warm and friendly but he is an expert
in handling people and food...great Italian food.

I refer customers to Roma Deli all the time when I hear them ask about great Italian food in Las Vegas.

And, recently, Bill Gates ate Italian food at Roma Deli after her was also referred to eat there since it is the best Italian Food available in all of Las Vegas.

Do yourself a favor and go to Roma Deli the next time you want genuine and authentic Italian food along with a great casual dining atmosphere that will make you feel like actually are in Italy.

And, tell Massimo that Louis and Holly sent you and he will simply give you that big and beautiful Italian smile of his and treat you like royalty!!!

{"text":"Wow! I don't know how anyone in our group found this place or heard about it, but after spending so much time on The Strip, a trip off the beaten path ($15 to $20 cab ride - and the cabbie knew the name of the restaurant, didn't need the address or anything) was very welcomed. Went on a Sunday night with a group of 4....so not a super big group or a super busy night, but we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Always a good sign.

Our waiter was super helpful and always had an immediate opinion when we asked for help deciding between 2 dishes, 2 wines, etc. Highly recommend appetizer #14 (the crunchy rice), any of the fried catfish sides/dishes, and the sea bass with drunken noodles. Best green curry I've ever had, and this is my litmus test at any new Thai restaurant I visit. Spice/heat is totally customized on a scale of 1 to 10. Our group ranged from 6.5 to 9.5.....definitely felt it, but sooooo yummy!

\"Normal\" prices and generous servings....we were all heartbroken we didn't have a fridge for our leftovers and couldn't take them with us. Will definitely go again on a future trip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is...bizarre.  The exterior looks like a foot massage parlor. It's in very close proximity to SEVERAL foot massage parlors, actually. After driving here with your Zagat review in hand, you'll double-check and triple - check whether you're at the right place.
But step inside, and your anxiety is replaced with welcome  relief. The floor-to-ceiling wine bottles behind the glass wall near the door assures you that not only are you safe, but that you'll probably leave with a full stomach and maybe a buzz. The decor is plain but comfortable.
The food, however, is hit or miss. We ordered the chicken satay and agreed that it was the worst both of us have ever had (& coming from different cities, we've sampled our share of Thai food). The chicken was a semi-soft, almost artificial consistency and the seasoned exterior was somewhat slimy.  The flavor itself was average. Insert *blechh!*-faced emoji here...
Our entrees were better, moving up to a solid, \"acceptable\". We ate them, but have had better. Mine was pad prik khing and hers was a curry shrimp dish.
Lastly, the dessert, coconut ice cream with sticky rice, was presented plainly (see pic), but really very good. As full as I was at that time, I didn't leave a grain of rice in that sadly empty little bowl.
Bottom line? 
Probably not worth the Uber trip cost, despite the fair prices. Stay on the strip."}
{"text":"There are two different kinds of restaurants in this world; those that are all about looks and those that are all about the food. LOS is definitely the second. 
This world famous restaurant serves a wide variety of dishes out of a small, unassuming storefront within the commercial center shopping block. The interior is a combination of fancy wine bar [glass covered wine racks, marble counters, lacquered wood, etc] and cheesy chinese restaurant. The food itself is the star, so I don't mind.

We started with a glass of wine each. I had a semi-dry riesling while J had a pinot noir. Both were fabulous and the wine list is epic! My riesling was fruity and crisp without being overbearing. It was a nice counterpoint to the spicy food. J's red wine was very smooth without any acidity

I ordered a cup of the Tom Kha Kai, a sweet and tangy coconut based soup with tender pieces of chicken and lots of veggies and fresh herbs. Most places use substandard chicken for this soup but that was not the case here. The soup was rich and extremely flavorful, easily the best thai soup I've ever had! 

We also had the papaya salad. I ordered it at a spice level of 9-10 and it was definitely spicy! It snuck up on me after a few bites and was quite strong, but the overall flavors were excellently executed. The contrast of pungent, savory, sweet, nutty, herbal and chiles was something I could find addictive. When we were leaving some of the employees seemed impressed, \"Ah, spicy number 10! that was you!\"

Next came the crispy duck with chu-chee sauce and garlic prawns. We originally inquired about the lobster, but they were out for the day and recommended the prawns instead. The crispy duck was tender with a light, crisp crust and a rich curry sauce. This was J's favorite and is a fabulous way to eat duck! The sauce is great over rice. 

The garlic prawns looked like a huge portion but it turned out that half the pile were empty shells. It was a bit deceiving but even the empty shells were pretty good with the seasoning. The prawns themselves were great, juicy and large. I don't think I would order this again if I weren't celebrating but it was very tasty.

I also had a thai iced coffee to go. It was a strong coffee with chicory flavors and a good balance of sweet and creamy to the bitter coffee. The portion was generous, too!

This is probably some of the best thai food you can find if you don't have a doting thai grandmother to lavish upon you. The meal ended up costing us almost $100, but it was worth it for a once a year celebration. I look forward to returning to try more of their food, like the Issan style tom kha kai, pad thai and sea bass. Their tea also looks really nice, served in a glass teapot that allows you to watch the water infuse. I didn't ask about it this time, but when we return I look forward to seeing what kinds of teas they offer.

Delicious food, well executed flavor combinations, cheap lunch buffet available, fantastic wine list, large menu and fairly quiet during week days. Worth going if you've never been!"}
{"text":"Amazing thai food. The location is a little suspect but once inside the restaurant is nice. I recommend the prawns and crispy rice. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Alright, let's talk Thai;  I could eat Thai food everyday, for every meal, I literally cannot get enough of Thai food into my pie hole. And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where  I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside....  not pretty.  So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since.  

And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.

Now please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...

As you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant.  In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.

Apart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...

My favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.

Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.

Another all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table. 

As dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.

{"text":"Such an awesome change from everything else in Vegas. The place has a cramped entry room, filled with photocopies of magazine reviews taped on the wall. It's located in a dingy strip mall with some other international-looking restaurants (Indian, Korean) and a pool hall.

My only goal was to order things I'd never heard of and was sure I'd not find elsewhere. So, no pad thai or green curry for me here!

o Mashed Jackfruit and Pork salad. (They held the pork though, since she's veggie.) It was odd, and one of those things I could hardly classify as animal / vegetable / mineral. Like nothing else I'd had... kind of sweet, kind of planty, a little bit oily. Winner.

o I-ssam pork sausage. This was... well, just a pork sausage, cut up into parts. It came on a plate by itself, served next to a wedge of cabbage, some fried peanuts, hot peppers, and onion. I was expecting it to be in something, but I had ordered essentially at random, so I couldn't complain. I did get some tips on eating it afterwards from our very helpful server.

o Green Dip with Chile and Mushroom. This was a surprise. It was a small bowl of what tasted similar to Hatch-style green chiles, with mushrooms, in a vinegar & spice sauce, with carrots and cucumbers for dipping / scooping. Very southwesty... in fact, the sort of thing you might see on the menu at some creative Santa Fe café. Except it's a native northern Thai dish! Total winner.

None of these were mind-blowing dishes by themselves, but they were awesome in that they were different from anywhere else. This food is authentic (or at least not Americanized), it's cheap, the staff were great. The menu is huge and I will campaign strongly for a return visit next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Made reservations yet still waiting 30 mins, not too bad since I heard the wait is always horrible.
First time here. Ordered a bunch, bill was a little high, food was great yet I don't think I would come again, nothing stood out.
The Service was the BOMB, the decor was so pretty and the restrooms were CLEAN :)
Come eat here! You wont be disappointed pho sho!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of those hidden gems or hole in a wall.  It's located in the outskirts of Vegas (or maybe downtown Vegas) but we're so glad we found it.  We ordered the garlic prawns ($22~) and the drunken noodles with crispy duck.  It was enough for two people for lunch.  The prawns were so delicious.  They were perfectly fried that even the shell was crispy and eatable.  The drunken noodles were so tasty.  It was a little on the spicier-end but overall a good mix with the crispy duck.  Wish I lived in Vegas to have it all the time and try the other dishes but definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Waited for long time to get a table there. We made a reservation one week ago but still needed to wait there for half an hour. There are too too too busy.
Definitely American style Thai food but still good. The duck was fried and cooked in curry sauce. It was crispy and juicy. The raw beef salad was surprisingly good. It was cooked outside and raw inside. Soaked in traditional Thai sauce with strong basil favor. A little bit chewy but tasted very good.
The ground pork was ok. Above average. We prefer the spice level for 3 but still too spicy for me.
My friend was addicted with there chicken satay. The chicken was marinated with curry sauce and perfectly cooked on charcoal. Juicy and tender. Strongly recommend.
The Tom yum soup has nothing like what I had in Thailand. The waiter asked me do I want coconut milk in my soup and I said yes. So I guessed it was more like a coconut-favor soup. It was very strong of coconut milk favor, thicker than normal tom yum soup, also very sour. Four jumbo shrimps in there. 
The mango sticky rice has the best mango I had in United States. Sticky rice was a little bit too dry for me."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Authentic Thai dishes! In Vegas!Luv da garlic prawn and panang!
Please call ahead for reservation, the place gets crowded easily"}
{"text":"This place certainly lives up to the reviews I've read. The garlic prawns are so tasty and the khao soi was the best crispy duck too. Very pleased and thankful to the staff as I made a reservation but came in on the wrong day. The lady there was kind enough to squeeze us in a very busy place in a very reasonable wait time.  Our server was cheerful and very helpful and made sure our glasses were always full. 

They don't give a lot on the food side but the quality definitely makes up for it. Gonna come back here again for sure and make sure i come on the correct day this time"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai, some of the best I ever had. Don't be discouraged by the creepy strip mall, this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Seriously people! I live in the Bay Area so I understand my benchmark is higher but this place was just ok. Super expensive. They can't cook Thai but they try. Good German wines tho."}
{"text":"My cousin and her friend loves this place (they're locals). and it was tasty! When you pull up it looks rugged, but upon entry to the dining area--pretty nice. Spacious and classy with a wall full of wine and a bar. It's something I would expect from a high end restuarant, but this place is pretty casual. You'll see some people in suits and others in shorts. They tell me it gets crazy busy and there's a wait time most nights because it's a hot spot for business meetings and after work dinner. Everything was good, but the larb stood out to me the most."}
{"text":"I knew that I had to venture off the strip for one meal during my week in Vegas, and I knew exactly where that meal was going to be. So, after work on a Thursday, I hailed a cab and told him to rush me to Lotus of Siam. I told my server about my peanut allergy and told him to pick me out an appetizer and an entrée that would represent the best the restaurant had to offer. To start, I had prawns that were wrapped in bacon, fried (in what tasted almost like egg roll batter), and served with sweet and sour sauce. Meaty and full of flavor, I would definitely order them again. For my main course, I had the drunken noodles with sea bass--and oh my gawd, that stuff was incredible. The fish was lightly fried and crispy on the edges, but velvety smooth on the inside. The noodles were tender and intensely flavorful, especially when paired with the peppers and basil leaves that accompanied them. I asked for the dish medium spicy, and it was the perfect amount of heat--it challenged my palate, but it didn't obscure the wonderful flavor of the delicate fish. After all of that food and two Singha beers (I had forgotten how good they were), I was as full as I've been in a while. But any stomach stretching was 110% worth it, as Lotus of Siam was the highlight of my Las Vegas dining."}
{"text":"I was with the bf and two others visiting in Vegas for my birthday. When my friend told me we were going to eat here and then I saw it a few days later on Bourdain's show, I was pretty excited. 

I have to say, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, or as my friends were. We ordered dishes that Anthony ordered and I thought they were just ok. Nothing impressed me as much as the garlic prawns, which we ordered a second helping of because they were so good. 

The dishes from the show were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was pretty good and had pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also ordered the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. That was quite tasty. 

I just thought, that many of the thai places I've eaten at in San Diego and LA, were better than this. Maybe this is considered really good for Las Vegas? 

You could see a lot of people arriving in taxis and I even asked one of them if they had seen the show and they said yes. Bourdain has a LOT of influence on people, that's for sure. But this foodie was only mildly impressed."}
{"text":"Foods are ok, the services suck, the waitress and the waiter are not friendly, very rude."}
{"text":"I was told this is the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. What a bold statement! I've only traveled a handful of states within and can say this isn't near the truth.

The layout of the restaurant felt awkward. The bar should be near the front entrance. It's weird for those waiting for a table to stare you down. All the windows are covered up so you're in this big recreation feel kind of room.

To the food. Menu was quite extensive and Authentic than most typical Americanized Thai restaurants. We ordered a pot of tom yum soup. The server should wait until the soup is fairly hot enough before serving our first bowl. It was barely lukewarm and tasted too fishy. Then we had a larb salad. Flavors on point but the herbs were old and wilted. Our last dish was the famous fried crispy prawn. I like how the shell was pulled back for the extra crunch. For price, it was way overpriced for ten shrimps. Overall, the food was pretty good and well worth the visit.

Most importantly, make reservation and they will hold your table for 10 minutes. They will also send you a text reminder. That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"The food is always decent with fast service but the restaurant needs a face lift and for me its location is out of the way."}
{"text":"Heard the rants about Lotus of Siam, and overall the food was good, service fair and atmosphere hectic. It was a solid A-ok. I would not make it a venture or go out of my way to return as I know there are better Thai places in town, maybe even in Commercial center. Lesson learned, just because a guy on TV rants a place does not mean it is worthy the praise especially when food and service returns to normal and you are not a mucky muck."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best but the food was amazing. I strongly recommend the Garlic Prawns!!"}
{"text":"The best thai food I've ever had! I cannot explain how delicious the food is, you have to go! The garlic shrimp are a must"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice, once in May of 2010 and recently in January of 2012.  LOS does NOT disappoint!  The buffet for lunch is great!  There are a lot of choices, the food is fresh and everything has its own, unique taste.  The Pad Thai and Green Curry should not be missed.  Even the Curry Rolls, like a sweet turnover for desert are super.  My two fellow diners ordered off the menu and were very pleased, but I prefer the variety of the buffet. You won't be disappointed here.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"food tasty
inside decor outdated and feels dirty
garlic prawns was the best
duck curry was good"}
{"text":"Wow.  This is the best thai food i've ever had.  Every bite had so much flavor.  Garlic Prawn is a must-have.  Be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations :)"}
{"text":"This has to be the BEST Thai food in the country.  I live in LA and I've been to many restaurants in Thai town but there's nothing like it!.  This has to be the most authentic Thai food outside of Thailand.  We ordered the papaya salad, Tom-Yum soup, pad see ew, garlic shrimp, fried catfish and their signature crispy duck panang curry.  Omg everything was so delicious!! 

We were there 30 mins before they opened and was able to get on the list, otherwise there is a very long wait.  It's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Regular Thai food nothing special about the taste..
Everything was overpriced..(120$ for 2 people..)
The place look very nice..
The service was not bad..
Took long time for the food to come about 23 min for the appetizers..

Basic place with overprices.."}
{"text":"King of the Northern Thai Food!!! Went here two nights in a row.  Skip to the back of the menu to the Northern section, and if you order pad thai or cashew chicken you should have your friend slap you.  

The first night I had the pork stew (Kang Hung Lay).  Originally I asked a busser what I should order, and he said the Dry Pork dish was delicious, but my waiter said \"No, you shouldn't order that.  You aren't Thai.  Thai people order that because it is very powerful smell.  Tastes good, but you order this next time you come. I'm not trying to be racist but you are too white.\"  This made me laugh.  I love honest people regardless of the PC.  


Night #1
The Kang Hung Lay was a perfect balance of rich spices and fats.  I'm a big veggie eater, so I recommend gettin a veggie dish if you order this. 

I also ordered the Nam Prick which is like cold steamed veggies with a red chili paste.  Very delicious.  Not too heavy.  Also could be a great appetizer. 

Also had a cup of the Tom Yum, the waiter did not get into specific level of spice I wanted, and it was soooo hot.  Tasted great, but I wish it wasn't as hot.  He said it was a level 4 which is the medium heat, but IMO it was spicer then what I like.  I prefer level 2. 

Topped it off with a perfectly made Thai tea and their fried banana (I will write about that later).  

The total meal was about $45 (not including tip) and it was plenty of food for two people.  

The second night I was contemplating getting Italian Food, but found myself craving more Thai (probably because I live in South Lake Tahoe and the Asian cuisine is terrible there).  So I went back to the restaurant and ordered all new items.  

Night #2

Fortunately I met up with a friend so we were really able to go to town on this meal and experience the menu.  

The bartender was a lady and listened to my request for something a little lighter.  I ordered the #14 which is the Nam Kao Tod.  They have it as an appetizer, which is different because it's not finger food. You get a perfect fresh blend of cilantro with the mint, mixed with a light chili sauce and the crunchy cubes of fried pork fat.  So good.  MUST HAVE. 

The next thing I ordered was the spicy shrimp salad, MUST HAVE!  The onions mixed with the grilled shrimp and secret sauce... mmmmmm.  Great to eat as a solo lunch without feeling too heavy.  Only thing is I wish they served it with a little more lettuce.

The Khao Soi is a coconut milk based curry with egg noodles.  It is also served with chicken, pork, or their most famous duck.  I'm not a huge duck fan (a bit too oily for me) so I went with the chicken.  However, I would recommend the duck at this restaurant.  It looks amazing.  

We also got the fried stuffed chicken wings.  Holy moley.  The breaded crispy mixed with the fillings inside, and a little drizzle of sweet and sour sauce. Great shareable treat as an appetizer.  They are much larger then you would expect being a chicken wing. 

Lastly, the dessert.  The fried banana with coconut ice cream topped with honey.  Don't skip on dessert. This was the best fried banana I've ever had.  My friend who was with me mother would make him fried banana all the time, and he said that was the best desert he's ever had.  Next time when it's in season I would love to try the mango with sticky rice (another personal favorite). 

If I could I would pay to work under that chef (which is a lady straight from Thailand)! She has a beautiful American success story and if you haven't read about her, google it.  

Will be back again!!! Thank you for the delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food Ive ever had anywhere! . Be careful
If you ask for spicy, because they will oblige! Fresh flavors and authentic food. Was the best restaurant on my Vegas trip! nice ambiance as well."}
{"text":"I had the perfect opportunity try another Thai restaurant in Vegas one that if live on the other side of town say is the best Thai food in Vegas. Since I live on the other side of town so prefer Archi and even after solid Thai food at Lotus of Siam still would take Archi. I went with big group there was 9 of us in all. So best part about that was did I get too try everything and the kitchen sink. Believe had over ten different dishes in all so just going too pick out the ones that stood out for me.

The crispy duck pagnang was very very good. The crispy duck something that could have had whole dish of by itself. It had the perfect crispy crust that crunch every time and still meat is moist. You combine it with sauce over rice. Fabulous! We had four different types of noodles from the traditional pad thai too other ones on menu gear more toward certain regional style. The pad thai was solid. Lo mein type of noodle really enjoyed because not normal one orange in color and tasty noodle. The pineapple fried rice was ok different but not something would order again. Green Papaya Salad had nice spicy kick too it. Solid choice. The winner for me was the FRIED BANANAS. Bananas wrapped in lumpia wrapping deep fried too perfect crispy brown and felt like hogging them all too myself. 

The location is one less then desirable part of town. It amazing never judge book by its cover. You walk into the place really small hallway too all sudden opens too restaurant hold over or close too 100 people. They had nice wine cellar that see lot of the win on the menu, It become popular cult almost they have pictures all famous people that have dined there on the walls. If run out of conversations look around guess who who on the walls. The menu is pretty massive in choices. So sure there is something there appeals too everyone. The service went on friday night even packed surprising was really quick once we got the orders in. There was no miss up and great service from start too end. Only negative is too far for me. Not sure the next time visit but if ever out in that area need Thai fix LOS the place too go."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I visit Vegas, Lotus of Siam is always on the list of restaurants to hit up. This gem is located off the strip and boasts a full bar, fantastic Thai dishes with Burmese influence, and a massive wine cellar that you can't miss when you first walk in. Looking through the menu can be intimidating because it is quite lengthy. Here are a few dishes that we absolutely love, and are highly recommended by the staff: 

Papaya Salad: Fresh, crunchy, and spicy (you can adjust the spice from 1-10). This salad balances out the heavy flavors of the other dishes. 4/5

Garlic prawns: An absolute must order. Packed full of garlic and double fried to perfection. You can eat the whole prawn (skin and tail) -- it's that good. 5/5

Khao Soi: Crispy duck served on egg noodles in a Thai curry sauce with red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. A Thai dish with Burmese influence; one of the chef's recommended dishes, and for good reason. This is my favorite dish, hands down. 5/5 

Pork Stew: Don't be deceived by the size of this stew. It's packed with deep curry flavor and pairs well with white rice. 4/5

Mango Sticky Rice dessert: Insanely delicious yet simple dessert. The warm and sweet sticky rice compliments the tangy mangos. Heavenly! 5/5

We will certainly be back then next time we are in Vegas! Check it out, you don't want to miss out on this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food is great! Especially the bacon wrapped shrimp! Unfortunately my boyfriend felt sick after eating the Pad Thai, but otherwise the food is great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful service! The Panang short rib, papaya salad and crispy rice were our highlights. After spending a lot of time in Thailand and loving the food, this is easily the best Thai food I have experienced outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Such a great find!  The location is a strip mall and at night empty, except this place. We ordered the garlic prawns and a soup. The food was delicious and service was great. I would suggest the garlic prawns as a must have."}
{"text":"When we arrived at 5:28 there were about 50 people already in line.  The line moves pretty quickly and we were told that our wait would be around 45 min.  However, after 20 min they texted that a table was available.  The reviews for the crispy duck panang curry were spot on.  The duck was nice and crispy and we got spicy level 4 out of 10 for the panang which was perfect.  The panang had a creamy consistency and a great balance of sweetness and spice.  We even put the panang on our sea bass that came with our drunken noodles.  It was fried with mild seasoning but tender as well.  The noodles were more saucy than I've had at other Thai restaurants but still wonderful.  The garlic scallops were delicious as well.  You could really taste the garlic and cilantro. The scallops were seared perfectly.  Great crust and super tender inside.  The star of the meal was the garlic prawns- OMG.  So amazing!!   Crispy and perfectly seasoned!!!  It was fun to see Saipin walking around and all her pictures with celebrities on the wall.  She has one with Elvis!!"}
{"text":"Of course I went to this resturant because it was on the Food Network.  I had to try it out.  Come to find out I had eaten there many times and it is ALWAYS good!!  Great food and great atmosphere! Drunken noodles were great and much cheaper than Wazuzu...Thanks for the great experience and can't wait to go back.  Nice and early to beat the crowd though!"}
{"text":"This Vegas treasure was truley worth the month in advance reservation we made. I had delicious coconut soup that was pefectly spiced. We also go the papaya salad, drunken noodles, and a red curry dish. Everything was so tasty and fresh. I love thai food and its hard to find that perfect combination of spicy yet savory and delicious. This spot hit it right on the nose!"}
{"text":"This review is only about the lunch buffet.
Like an earlier yelper commented,the buffet is lame.
It's very small & did'nt have any curry items.
I expected the buffet to be the restaurant's way of introducing itself to new customers by offering them samples of what they serve.
It was just fast food thai junk.
It turned me off.

Oddly,the restaurant was fairly full but I doubt the people seated were eating from the buffet.

So either offer better samples of what you can cook  in the buffet table or get rid it.

I think"}
{"text":"The best Thai cuisine for sure hands down. The food is totally authentic and they offer northern style too which is so good. I was shocked they had sticky rice which was perfect. The wine selection literally the best in town. This place is now a tradition every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant, we have never been disappointed, order off the menu, not the buffet, it is really good. Charming hole in the wall."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there on Saturday night after CES. I tried to call and make reservation and was informed that they were fully booked. We decided to go try our luck anyway. The hostess told us the wait time was 45 minutes. However, we got lucky because someone canceled while we were waiting at the bar after 5 mins!
We have been there before and it was an ok experience.
This time, I did my homework and we had a great time.
We ordered four dishes.
Stuffed wings, Pork larb, Drunken noodle with seafood, BBQ Beef.
Our favorites are Drunken noodle and BBQ Beef. Noodles had great flavor and the beef was just right.
Our waiter and bartender were both polite, soft-spoken, and attentive. 
We also saw people ordered Drunken noodle with fried prawn. It looks amazing. I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Nam Khao Thod and the Tom Kha is definitely a must try in here. Coming from Asia myself, I must say this is definitely one if the best and authentic Thai food I have ever had. I am so thankful to the friends who introduced us to this place. It has become our go-to everytime we are down in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tons of choices, all authentic, fresh, and delicious! Party of 5 with main dishes, appetizers and drinks less than a Ben Franklin. Great service and relaxing intimate atmosphere. Off the strip by 10 min and worth every effort. Second visit here to make sure it was no fluke the first time. Wasnt disappointed. Will go back soon!!"}
{"text":"We're back for some crispy duck panang!!! They raised the price since the last time. One small portion of the dish now cost 27.95. We called in our order for pick up knowing how long the wait is and how crowded it gets. The staff on the phone was nice enough to inform me about the price and portion. (Thank you!) I was told to come in 40mins. 

We also ordered their pineapple fried rice ($11.95). Rice was soft and fluffy with delicate sweetness and it was really tasty. One of the best I've had. We wanted to order another dish so I went full on review reading mode on Yelp and settled for their chicken khoa soi ($10.95). It's thin yellow noodle and you doused them in this spicy, sweet, and out of this world semi-thick sauce/gravy. They serve it with lime, raw onion, and crispy strips of fried tortilla?!!! I dunno but it's sooooo good! They will also ask you for the level of spice. I ordered spicy and it's SPICAAAAAAAAY!!! 

Took a mediocre photo with bad lighting in our hotel room BUT the food was anything but."}
{"text":"This review is based on having the lunch buffet which is available on weekdays for $10.99. Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.

When we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about 5-10 seconds, he walks back in front of us and says \"maybe they're not here yet\", as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if we're not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back. We ignored the host and just made our way towards them. 

After being seated it was impossible to get someone to stop at our table to ask questions about the buffet and menu. I thought about ordering off the menu,but my group wanted to go for the buffet, so I thought why not? Once we started eating, the only time we saw a server was when we needed refills on water and soda. No one ever stopped by to ask us how we were doing or took our plates. I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters' supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe 2/3 of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I would've taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess' don't know what they're doing either.

The buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only 2 tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland (pad thai especially) and some of the fried items were 90% dough and not much filler (egg rolls, fried banana are examples). The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.

While I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and I've had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt we'd be back in the future. Not sure how this place got their Zagat rating because I'm pretty sure service counts for something."}
{"text":"Not a particularly magical place as it's got bad 80's diner decor. As the food goes, it's pretty good...but overrated. The ricekrispy-sausage bit thing for an appetizer, a northern thai dish with jackfruit and dried sliced fish, and then the sea-bass, steamed with red chili. A lime juice and a singha beer. Sea-bass was the best dish, somewhat pricey at $23, but served on a bed of wilted cabbage, which was kind of disappointing as it said \"vegetables\". The driced sliced fish was at the recommendation of the waiter, but it's flavor overwhelmed.  Free rice, which is cool. I'd come again and try some other things, as the menu is extensive."}
{"text":"Growing up on Southeast Asian cusine, I was very excited to go to this place after all the rave reviews, and articles written about it (posted all over in their waiting room).
I have to confess that we came here a few times over the last couple years, which I am embarrassed to say...but in my defense, we have a Thai food lover in our midst and didn't know where else to go to satisfy her Thai food crave...
But after the last time I was there...I swore not to come back.
I have two comments about this place 1) OVER-RATED and 2) OVER PRICED. And of course it qualifies as the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. 
Don't know what's wrong with those white people writing rave reviews about this place in those magazines. They are either snobs who pretended to know what they're talking; or she probably fed them the magic mushroom during their reviews.
You don't need to like Thai food to know that it's not good.
Don't go there and save yourself some money to take your friends and family to an authentic place that doesn't rip you off because it can."}
{"text":"Yes... It was as good as the ratings suggest. Better in fact.
I live in AZ, and I am so sad I can't come here daily.
IT WAS F'ING AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had. Highly highly recommend their soft shell crab drunken noodles and crispy duck panang. Came to Vegas for the weekend from California, and I'm so so grateful my boyfriend was adamant about trying this place."}
{"text":"Really popular place with pretty good food.  The location is absolutely terrible but I guess that kind of adds to the experience.  You definitely don't want to walk to this place from las vegas blvd. if you are staying there.  Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but worth every cent! The food is excellent with a large selection to choose from...appetizers, soups, salads, chefs specials...a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10! 
We started with chicken satay appetizer followed with deep fried Chilean sea bass for Grace and a combo Pad Thai for me...both dishes were excellent! 
Gotta try this one if you like Thai food...the staff is first class also!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all the good Thai food around Los Angeles but from start to finish this place was just ok. I went with a group of 20 so they seated us in different sections. I was totally ok with that. The outside of the restaurant is far from anyplace anybody would want to hangout at for any length of time.  The inside looks pretty nice. Atmosphere was great. A. It tight in some of the seating areas though.  The food was ok but not great. My expectations were too high I guess.  It's probably great as a local restaurant but as a traveler I wouldn't feel the need to go out of my way to stop by.  
Some of the food came out cold. The fish was really fishy.  The pad Thai was stuck together. Other dishes were good. The soup was my favorite part of the meal. But in our group of 20, the people were split good and ok 50/50."}
{"text":"Touted as one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas, I was very excited to try their food. Well, the food was just about average. My friend and I had their Pineapple fried rice, a curry dish, and fried prawn dish. Nothing exceptional, but about average. I've had better Thai food in Baltimore."}
{"text":"Drunken noodle with fried prawns...just unbelievable.  Most amazing Thai food I've ever eaten and the prices are quite reasonable. They also have an extensive wine selection. This is an outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"We came here after booking a table 1.5 months in advanced. It was good. We had the garlic prawns spicy wings pad see ew and rad na curry and all were good. Wings were 8-9 bucks for like 6 pieces didn't seem worth it but it was tasty. The pad see ew was Better than most I had at home. Prawns were amazing- crispy all around and the first time I ate the shell and all! Why 4 not 5 stars? The service. It wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular. We were with another couple and they ordered a Thai coffee. In the end we both got charged for the Thai coffee and when I told the guy he acted confused. Perhaps it was a language barrier but I told him I'll just buy one so make me one to go and you can leave it on my bill. He made it and I didn't really like the Thai coffee. O well. Sucks I felt bad and got something I really didn't want and ended up not liking so much. He didn't admit he mistake or anything but more questioned if I really never got it. Other than that it was good food and that's what matters. Bathrooms were decently clean. Almost packed right when it opened."}
{"text":"Tonight we were trying to find someplace new, thai food in particular,  and stumbled across the many reviews. Curious, we decided to give it a try.

First of, you wouldn't expect to find a great place for food in the run-down \"mini-mall\" that it is located in. One advice, go there during \"lit hours\" if you are by yourself.  Luckily, it's still light out after 7pm.  

We walked in at 7pm on a Thursday night without reservations and the place was pretty full.  At first the guy told us it would be at least a 30 minute wait but then said that he could seat us if we didn't take more than 1 hour. Since it was just the 2 of us, we said of course! I would recommend reservation esp if you have a big party.  It looks like they had a separate section for a bigger party (maybe 20+) but the biggest table I saw sat 12 people comfortably.  

The food was excellent!  We skipped the appetizer and went straight for the meal. We had the green papaya salad, drunken seafood noodles, and red curry with chicken.  We asked for everything mild and It was \"just right, a little sweat and tears\" spicy.  It came with a side of jasmine rice but we had 1 order of sticky rice esp for the curry! Yum!  The portions weren't huge but between the both of us, we ate pretty much everything.  Now, we could've been done without desert but the table next to us ordered a whole bunch and we couldn't resist!  So, we had shared 2 of them: fresh sliced mango with sticky rice topped with a light cream sauce AND coconut ice cream. Oooooh, so yummy!  Yes, we finished that without a problem.

The service was good.  We had a bunch of people helping us and our water glass was never empty.  Thank goodness with all the spicy-ness!  The one thing I thought was strange was that after we got our food, no one came by to ask us how things were until we were almost done eating everything. Then again, maybe that's probably why huh? They probably didn't want to interrupt the \"shoveling\" of food! Ha! 

We will definitely go again.  I'm curious about their lunch buffet that was being advertised as $8.95.  Our meal described above (including desert) was all under $50!  Thanks for all of your reviews. We just found a new great place for Thai!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and the US.... I have not encountered many Thai restaurants that are as good as this one... Really crummy area but the food is worth it...."}
{"text":"I returned for a lunch after a year. I ordered roasted duck red curry, fried shrimps, pineapple fried rice and stuffed chicken wings. I recommended the stuffed chicken wings. I was not impressed like the first time I visited. This time experience is totally different ( not so impressive ). I feel like I paid high price for average Thai food."}
{"text":"First time customer, came highly recommended by local friends. Location is not situated in a very nice area which my sister's friend conveniently forgot to mention. We went for Sunday dinner, waited for 10 minutes at the bar. They have spacious clean eating area with walls full of wine selection. Ordered only a few dishes which are Fried Prawns (delicious for $32 for only 8 pcs), Steamed Sea Bass (not recommending this dish, very small serving), Fried Rice (very small serving as well), and Chicken Satay for appetizer. Its suppose to be family style serving but I say the portions are small. Verdict, its good to try but I wont be back. Too pricey for what it is and location is scary. Reservation is needed for other nights for sure."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. If you do not like to venture out from your common traditional Thai dishes like Pad Thai, Pad see ew, this place is not for you. I really need to venture out when it comes to Thai food and this place gives us the perfect opportunity to do so. 

We drove off the strip to check out this place. It's in a plaza next to some Korean Club/Karaoke joint. I'm not going to lie but I definitely wanted to check out the Korean place out. Maybe some other time. 

We got a bottle of White Wine, The sticky rice appetizer, Crispy Duck in Panang Curry, Garlic Prawns, and Drunken noodle with crab. 

Honestly the food was phenomenal. The only issue I had was that I felt that the portions were small and pretty pricey for the amount of food you get and what it is. Obviously if a restaurant like Lotus of Siam gets so much hype you can probably charge whatever you want. I would definitely come back again. This time I hope I win money in Vegas so I can order more food without feeling bad about it. Haha."}
{"text":"Excellent local jewel close to the heart of Las Vegas. The size of the line outside the doors before opening time is an indicator to the quality of the food inside. By far the best massaman  curry I've had in the states and I highly recommend it. The Panang curry is wonderful as well but watch the spice level as the heat intensity is high on that dish. Again, an excellent choice for authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Having the unique perspective of being raised in Thailand coupled with 15 years in the food business, one could say I am qualified as an authority on Thai food, however, really,  the true authority on anything to do with food and drink is the taste buds of the person eating. And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix. I can get in and out of there in a half hour, and make it back to work on time."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars..
waiters were enthusiastic but poorly trained.
Area is scary at night. 
Restaurant was very tired.
Would probably not go back, there is such a big competition out there in Vegas."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food in town!! A MUST have/visit...Don't leave town with out having one of the best meals you'll ever have in your life!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Thai, and I am happy to report I am satisfied on how Lotus of Siam presented it.

We had the roasted duck curry, and the chicken wontons for appetizers. 

The prices are reasonable too. $11-30 bucks for entrees, and $7-10 bucks fpr appetizers.

Highly recommend to make a reservation. They were quite busy when my wife and I went"}
{"text":"While being on the road to Vegas for a grueling ten hours, my cousins and I were very famished. I wanted a buffet, but majority ruled on getting something off the strip. Then my cousin suggested eating at one of his MUST EAT AT restaurants in Vegas, Lotus of Siam!

We just got to the restaurant just in time before closing for dinner service. The hostess sat us quickly and hand us our menus. I wanted to try some of their popular menu items, but I had to hold back on them. Since it was the season of Lent, I had to avoid beef, pork, and fowl foods. Being in the city of sin, I decided to be good on a Friday. It was a hard decision for me, but I went with the pad see-ew.

Our entrees were served withing a couple minutes. The pad see-ew was composed of stir-fried wide rice noodles, eggs, and Chinese broccoli all mixed with black soy sauce. Although the pad see-ew had egg in it, it was one item that I could have while observing Lent. The noodles were nice and chewy. The Chinese broccoli was crispy and fresh. The egg was in the scrambled form, but added the protein element to the dish. To complete the melody of the dish, the black soy sauce gave the right amount of saltiness. Just like one of my favorite dishes, Chow fun, I really did enjoy this dish.

I do need to come back again and try the other popular dishes when in Vegas and not observing Lent."}
{"text":"We had dinner there a year ago, and it was the best Thai food I've ever had.  I've been searching for something comparable since, and have failed.

Do NOT eat at their lunch buffet.  I'd give the lunch buffet 2 stars.  It's like they have two different chefs."}
{"text":"I was wildly impressed with the OFF STRIP food on this trip to Vegas! This place is AUTHENTIC!!  I sat down and asked my waitress to send out what the chefs thought best. We ended up with one of the most extrordinary Thai dinners I've had anywhere...and I spend a lot of time eating in LA and Vegas, not to mention the 6 weeks in Thailand. This place is open late, the staff is friendly, expect a wait unless you have reservations, but you can run next door and play pool while you wait! My advice, wander away from the Strip and eat like a local. Not only will you find some amazing food, you will save big bucks!"}
{"text":"The best Thai ever! Incredible service, they must have 2,000 bottles of wine, do not miss the crispy duck, fried prawns, coconut milk curry, dumplings, I could go on and on. Make sure your driver knows where it is cause it's definitely in an obscure location."}
{"text":"First Yelp review ever. 
This place was way too ordinary, & and over hyped. 
Food critics gave this place 5/5 stars. 
But the real critics are your own taste buds. 
Don't fall for this $100 meal for two! 
Stick with restaurants that cater to your needs. And your wallet"}
{"text":"This Thai spot NEVER fails. I could eat here every day of my life. So many unique and authentic dishes to try it makes your head spin with joy. Literally everything is delicious. Make sure you make a reservation though!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The waiters suck and food was pricey.  I politely asked for a few things (water and another side of rice) yet it did not come until the I had asked a third time. Of course when requesting my check, it did not come. I had to go to the desk."}
{"text":"I have seen this restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown and Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods America. So, was it any good?

My wife and I came here for a early dinner. Needless to say, I was not so surprised to see the place packed full of customers at 6 pm on a Wednesday. They even have a celebrity wall of fame. We ordered the following:

Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip) $10.95

Isaan Sausage $9.95

Garlic prawns $21.95

Tom Yum Koong (Bowl) $10.95

Crab Fried Rice $13.95

The food was very good. I would say the best dish was the crab fried rice. It had a good balance with the egg, tomato, and onions. The dip was okay. It tasted like spicy bolognese (did i spell that right?) sauce thai style that you can dip fresh veges and chicharron pieces into. FYI, the spicy level was a 3 1/2 out of 5 for my taste and the menu stated it was the least spiciest of the dips! The Isaan sausage tasted good. Think sour longanisa but in a good way. I did though take out some of unrendered fat bits out. The Garlic prawns were pretty tasty. You could eat the shells which was plus. It was a little on the greasy side so the extra napkins surely helped. The soup was good but not something I would order again. Overall I would say that Lotus of Siam was a good experience. The staff are very attentive and friendly. They even pack your leftovers for you and answer any questions about the menu in a short yet concise way. I'll come again to try the crispy duck and the crab fried rice again...and a beer!"}
{"text":"\"You must go to Lotus of Siam,\" they said.
\"It's the best Thai food you'll ever have,\" they said. 

Don't believe the hype.

I visited Lotus of Siam with a small group of co-workers while in Sin City for a business trip. We arrived at the restaurant promptly at 8:20 to be told our table wasn't ready although the reservation was made months in advance. Nonetheless, we patiently waited because \"it would be worth it.\" 45 minutes later, a table finally opened up. 

By this time we were all hangry and quickly ordered our food. An array of appetizers were ordered for the table along with entrees for each person (5 total). On top of waiting 45 minutes to be seated, even though we had a reservation, two of our entrees never came! We politely advised 3 different members of the waitstaff about the missing dishes, and watched as surrounding tables continued to receive their orders of Garlic Prawns and Pad Thai before us. Sadly, the 2 dishes never came...and the employees could care less. We didn't receive a single apology and even felt rushed to vacate the table. 

The food that we did receive was nothing to rave about in my opinion. I ordered the Khao Soi as an entree (I've had this dish before in other top-rated Thai restaurants) and was not impressed with their curry broth or noodles. The broth did not have much flavor and just tasted like coconut milk while the noodles were mushy and tasted overcooked.

To sum it all up, my experience at Lotus of Siam was disappointing. The food was mediocre at most and the service was sub-par. Honestly, I believe this could have been a five-star dining experience once upon a time, but now it's merely a tourist trap. I've eaten far better, authentic, Thai food at home in New York City."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I had very high expectations going into this restaurant. Apparently it's one of the highest ranked restaurants in Las Vegas and it definitely exceeded my expectations!

The restaurant itself is a complete dive. It's one of the only thriving businesses in the strip mall where it's located and everything else is pretty deserted. There is a constant stream of cabs and line of people going in and out of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend making a reservation! Otherwise the wait can be over an hour!

The food was amazing. I love Thai food and definitely have my favorites that I typically ordered. On this occasion however, we chose to order outside of our normal dishes. Our server recommended the garlic prawns, duck panang, short ribs and sea bass with drunken noodles. It was all fabulous! I'm not usually a fan of the drunken noodles but these were delicious. Warning - if you do not like garlic do not get the prawns. I love garlic so these were perfect for me. They were so yummy!

Service was great. We had two guys helping us out and they were awesome. One guy consistently kept our water glasses full and the other guy was great with food recommendations. 

I will definitely be back but only if we have reservations. The wait would be miserable!"}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch here. From the reviews, I was expecting Lotus to blow my mind - and it didn't. 
Don't judge this place by it's cover - the outside looks pretty ghetto - the inside is MUCH better.

After reading through some reviews, we ended up ordering:
1)Tom Kah Kai - A distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice. $4.95 for a cup - it was good, not the BEST I've had, but pretty comparable to other Thai restaurants. 
2)Nam Kao Tod -Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. - $7.95 : this had a lot of flavor, actually TOO much flavor. It was pretty salty. The first few bites were really good, after that, the flavor kicked in and it was hard to eat. Unique dish though, never had it before.
3) Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck - Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil. Serve on the top of pan fried flat rice noodle. - $21.95 : this dish was GOOD, it could have used more noodles though - they gave us enough for one person, hardly enough for 2 people to share. Most people want more meat - and here we wanted more noodles, they gave us a good amount of crispy duck though. The flavors blended together perfectly. Would def. recommend this dish. 
4) Thai Iced tea - $2.50 each : the tea taste was stronger than any other Thai tea I've had - so if you're really into tea - that's a good thing. I'm not into that strong taste so I handed it over to my bf.

Dinner came out to be $42 exactly before tip. So if you get these dishes, expect to spend about $50. and that's with no dessert. =(

The best Thai restaurant in North America? I have to disagree. It's ok, but definitely not the best. I guess that's what happens when places are hyped - you expect too much. If you come here not expecting much, maybe it will live up to the hype. Sorry ya'll."}
{"text":"The best Thai resto I have ever been to. All the dishes we ordered were awesome esp the garlic prawns which are to die for. I wanna go back already! Too bad we have to drive 5hrs to get here."}
{"text":"Good location, good price, Northen Thai food. BOMB! The space is really pretty and they provide good service. You should reserve a table in advance or else you have to wait since it's pretty busy.

I love Pad Thai and the skewers. Get those!"}
{"text":"This is the new location for the famous Lotus Of Siam's James Beard chef, featured on Travel Channel & Food Network, and it exceeded the hype. Finally made it in at 11 AM on a Friday and by the time I left at noon the restaurant was full with a line out the door.  How can a restaurant be that good in Vegas?  Well start with the beautiful decor & bar, tall ceilings, and knowledgeable and passionate waiters.  Started off with light and crunchy wontons that set the palette going.  Then the most vibrant and soul sensing Thai coconut chicken soup that was so good it made me want to cry.  My main course was the chef selection of crispy duck in yellow curry at heat level #6 on a scale of 10.  The duck and it's crunch popped in my mouth, and the heat made me break out in a happy drenching sweat.  Can I give it 6 stars?  Wow"}
{"text":"Maybe I came there on an \"off-day\"... or maybe it's just not as good as it seemed by the reviews. 

I wish I could take back the 2 hours we spent there.  I'm very thankful we didn't have to wait outside for a table...

Honestly, I've experienced better.  There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas, and I would make this one of the last places I would ever want to go back to.  The place looks like a gem, compared to everything else in that strip mall.  Perhaps their going for a \"hole in the wall\" effect. But overall, their prices and taste don't match up, in my opinion.  

The service was not so good.  The table next us complained numerous times about the waitress not getting their food right. I wasn't happy about seeing an automatic charge of 18% gratuity being automatically added to our bill.  -- There were only 3 of us.  I know we were pleasant guests since we had a very simple order and didn't demand anything of the staff. 

What did we order?
Beef Penang - it was ok
Pad Thai - ok
Crispy Prawns - or whatever that expensive appetizer was called - ok

I am a person that likes to Instagram good food from places I like to eat.  I seriously didn't have the heart to do so for this place... I just couldn't do it it my friends. I wouldn't want them to waste time here either. 

I hate writing bad reviews.  But I seriously am still not happy with the time and dollars I spent there. The money  I can always replace, but the time wasted during our vacation I'll never get back."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Get there as soon as they open because this place fills up fast! When I was there I got the buffet and everything was superb!!! My friends and I can't leave Vegas without eating here."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a door that makes it really a place easy to be ignored. The inside is totally different, big and nic vibe. I ordered fuck noodle soup like what I usually do in every Thai restaurant. It was fantastic! My picky boyfriend stole a lot foods from my plate while enjoying his, lol... Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Every plate eaten here was delish! Braised rib anything, the duck, the panang curry anything and match it with one of their amazing wines. Holy smokes. The service was superb as well!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Over rated. Long lines in the simmering desert heat. No thanks.

One or two dish that is different. The deep fried prawn dish is good.

Other than that, I would not recommend this place when there are so many restaurants in the desert."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai Restaurant I've ever eaten at!!! The seafood drunken noodles are to die for, the bar has definitely been raised after eating here!"}
{"text":"My friends were in town for two days, and where else would I take them? We arrived on a thursday evening at 5:20pm. Reservations were booked (I attempted to make reservations 3 days ahead without avail), so the hostess notified me to arrive before opening hours. We were first in line and were seated within 5-10 minutes. Great service! Our favorite was the khao soi (different variations of meat: chicken, duck ,etc). My favorite was duck! Will be back to try more dishes! Beautiful interior decor."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Great curry!  We thought it would be a 45 minute wait for dinner and were seated within 15 minutes.  Really good service and fantastic food.  Have been here a number of times and every experience there has been consistent and enjoyable in every aspect."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at Lotus of Siam after being introduced to this restaurant years ago by our friends from LA. This restaurant does not skimp on flavors. EVERYTHING is bursting with lots and lots of flavors.

Now I can take some heat; I can take jalapeños no prob and even little bits of habanero in my sushi. But the mild level of spiciness of Lotus of Siam's soup is a bit much for me especially after the chili sits in the soup for a while. So order at your own risk!

Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage is one of the popular dishes mentioned here on Yelp and it deserved the reputation. Like I said, BURSTING with flavors.

The crispy duck with chu-chee was delicious!  Now I had no idea what chu-chee is, but the crispy duck came out in a red curry. Both the duck and the curry was very good. My only complaint is the price tag of $20 for a few pieces of duck and not very much sauce. It was good though!

If you took a cab to Lotus of Siam, be sure to ask the cab driver for a card/phone # and call for a cab to pick you up when you get the check. It does take some time for cabs to get to this location so if you call when you get the check, you shouldn't have to wait much longer after you're done settling the bill."}
{"text":"You lost two stars right off the bat how the hostess lie to my face and tells me it will be a 15-20 minute wait for a table or I can sit at the bar right away. I said. I don't mind waiting and bam less than 3 sec we have a table for you and as I am being brought to my table I see like 4-5 empty tables in the back."}
{"text":"If you are driving here, it is easy to miss this place since it is very nondescript amongst all of the other restaurants in the strip mall. The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, so I was concerned that I might have come to a bad area. There seemed to be enough other people standing around waiting for taxis that I wasn't too concerned (though I did keep looking around me as I walked to my car to make sure I was safe!)

Inside, the restaurant looks much nicer. There is a glass enclosed wine cellar in the background and photos of celebrities who have eaten there on the wall. 

Their menu is huge and I'm sure I didn't order the most adventuresome dishes since I wanted to be able to compare their dishes to ones I am familiar with. 

I went with my mom, who is gluten intolerant and also can't tolerate spicy food. The wait staff very courteously took note of her dietary restrictions and actually followed them (she sometimes will order food prepared \"mild\" from restaurants only to find it intolerably spicy to eat). I was pleasantly surprised about this since some restaurants with foreign (or even domestic, for that matter) cuisine don't understand when you make a request to prepare things gluten free. 

We had thai iced teas, green papaya salad, massaman curry, and mango with coconut sticky rice. All of the food was excellent. 

So in summary: you might get lost finding the place, but it is a good place to bring friends to with dietary restrictions. I don't think the food we tried was any more amazing than any other good Thai restaurant I've been to, but I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good Thai restaurant with an extensive menu."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this authentic Thai restaurant and was sorely disappointed. The only good thing we had was the Thai beef jerky. Everything else was unmemorable as I literally can't remember what else we ordered.  Very greatly disappointed =("}
{"text":"What can I say that my buddy Jay F didn't say in his review about this spot? 

Well, I was in town visiting from San Francisco over Memorial Day weekend, and Jay knew I'm a bit of a foodie, so he mentioned Lotus of Siam early in the trip as a \"must go\" place to dine. We finally went the last night I was in town, and I was seriously blown away at how amazing the food was. And for the price, you honestly cannot beat it! 

I would be remiss without also mentioning their rather extensive and nicely executed wine list. Coming form the Bay Area, that is a must, and LoS did not disappoint. 

In short...for details, read Jay F's review - otherwise, trust me when I say, GO TO LOTUS OF SIAM - you will thank me for it...at least until you're finding yourself craving it and being 1000 miles away...

Like Arnie Schwarzenegger once said....\"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai restaurant in the entire universe! You will not believe that a world-class restaurant could exist in this shopping center but it does. Huge menu, nice wine selections, great service and AMAZING food. There will probably be a huge wait and the best way to spend it is a couple doors down getting a foot massage."}
{"text":"Hello. First time diner, long time admirer. 

Okay this will be a somewhat incomplete report. Not that I didn't have dinner there nor did I leave early. Nope. I had appetizer, salad, main course and dessert. So why the incomplete?

Well, with over 150 items (I can't remember the full count) there's a lot to try. With this first visit, we decided to go Thai lite. But not to worry dear Yelpers, I have more visits planned. Luckily, my sister teaches at the high school just down the street so I'll always have an excuse. 

So enough with the pleasantries. Time for the food goodness. To start, we had fried chicken dumplings. It was good though not entirely memorable. I liked eating it but I don't have to have it on my next visit. 

Also up for starters is the traditional Thai salad with peanut dressing. I don't need to say much about this except that my brother in law was slurping up the dressing and kept the bowl of dressing on the table after the salad greens were removed. (He later poured some on his steamed rice. Don't ask.)

For the main dishes, we went with pad Thai (good), sua rong hai (yummy grilled beef with a nice spicy sauce) and panang curry with chicken (my favorite out of the three). 

For dessert we had a rice pudding and fried banana roll. Both if these are very good. I especially enjoyed the banana roll with coconut sugar(?) wrapped in fried crispy wonton goodness. I could've eaten just the innards (good by their lonesome) if I wanted to save a few calories. But why bother living at all? So just shove it all in your mouth and swallow, calories be dammed. (Get your minds out of the gutter, but the double entendre is understandably apropos.) 

So nothing mind-blowingly exciting but good solid eating. I spent a lot of time looking at other tables' orders like the whole fried fish or battered shrimp that caught my eye. Yes, I had prawn envy. 

But I vow to return and try all the other goodies. If my first tastes are good enough to go back before the check has even arrived, then you know me likey. 

Next time you're in Vegas, stop by and get some prawns. I will be."}
{"text":"New location! 
Located where Roy's (RIP) used to be off Flamingo road. Don't believe the haters, the food is bomb as usual and the staff are amazing juggling gangs of hungry diners and still providing superior customer service.  IMO, your best bet is to text them since their phone rings off the hook non stop. That being said, simply text them in regards to any available reservations. If no reservations are available, you can ask about wait time and they'll let you know. I got a response in less than 5 min! They told me they were fully booked for Friday night but I could walk in. When I arrived, I was told the wait would be 45min. Surprisingly, my table was ready in less than 15! These guys run things very efficiently here, which I can appreciate.  They've been open for a little over a week now and I'd have to say I was pleased with the service and all the dishes I ordered were fantastic.
I enjoyed the classics like the crispy shrimp, the duck panang, yum nua and the tom kha soup.  Flavors were familiar with the exception of the Tom Kha. It was a bit more sour then I remembered but I was not put off by the flavors at all, just a slightly different take on what I'm accustomed to. Other than that, I felt right at home like i was dining at the old lotus in the OG hood. Keep in mind the restaurant is much larger and more spacious. It's situated in a much nicer location and all the things you love are still there. Be warned, they're still waiting on the liquor license so it's BYOB at the corner liquor store for now if you want alcohol with your meal. Btw, no corkage fee either!
Overall though, I'm glad they relocated because it wouldn't be a complete trip to Vegas without dining at Lotus of Siam!

Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"2 stars in my book. Once in awhile you'll run across one of those overrated places and this was it for me. My first attempt was awhile back but it was closed at certain hour. I believe they open till lunch only and then open again around 5 for dinna. 

My group came in few minutes after they open to avoid the long line. You bet there were people already dining at that time. The restaurant itself is quite nice and the service was great. All dishes were presentable but taste wise was completely different from what I thought.

We ordered the typical dishes that almost everyone would order when you go to a Thai place.

Pineapple Fried Rice: it was literally 1 bowl of rice. The rice was not bad but lack of pineapple and meat.

Beef Salad: I did not like how saucy they made this dish. It gives the salad a weird taste to it. And the beef proportion is more than salad, which others might like but not me!  

Pad Thai: The only dish that I have no complaint with. It was your typical pad thai where you can order anywhere. 

Pad Sew Ew: This is a simple dish. Noodles, meat and some sauce. It does look like other pad sew eww dish but the flavor was completely different. As if they put curry flavor in it or something."}
{"text":"A reservation documented incorrectly was quickly corrected by the lovely ladies of Lotus of Siam. (penciled in for Saturday instead of Friday). We were seated despite the mix up AND before our \"reservation\" time.  Low and behold, I am impressed, we were off to a good start! 

With all of my party seated and accounted for, our food server for the evening promptly took down our appetizer orders. Much to my continued surprise by the stellar service at this Thai house of awesomeness, our food arrived in a timely fashion and our orders were not only CORRECT, but none forgotten! 

The only glitch in the evening was during dinner service; one or two meals trickled out behind the rest. When I inquired within, it was explained that they have several cooks preparing at different stations so the timing for each meal prepared is not always exactly on point with the rest. With that being said, all is forgiven for these delicious eats.

 It's quite a daunting task for most restaurant establishments to place the correct order, number one, let alone place it and not forget to bring it all to the table at the same time.

My take on food quality is this. Quite tasty. Being oh so unoriginal, I ordered the Pad Thai and vegetable fried rice. I know, I know.. for someone so creative there is a lot to be said about my creativity while dining..but I digress.

The Pad Thai was exceptionally delicious, not dry, noodles cooked to perfection. Dislike: the server did fail to ask me at what heat level I would like my dish therefore I was left with absolutely NO spice what so ever. I may be unoriginal in dining dish decision making, but I do like to spice things up..with spices.

In closing, Lotus of Siam's exceptional customer service, attention to detail (& ability to overcome clarical errors), and hell attention to our large party in general would have us coming back for more."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would.  This place is absolutely amazing.  Wait was 45 minutes, which wasn't bad; but with 2 kids they were pretty frantic when we were seated.  Our gracious waiter rushed our appetizer order so the kids could eat.  Also, it was our first time trying Thai food and our waiter made great recommendations.  Can't wait to go back."}

{"text":"you cant claim to really know vegas, unless you know about little gems like these around town that receive acclaim (featured in Bon Appetit Mag) and is hidden from the out of towners and tourists... and hidden is an understatement... its situated in a seedy strip mall, but i can only guess that it was the shiznit back in the day - seeing that the Las Vegas Country Club is within a stones throw away...anyways:

the GRUB:
- downright tasty... seriously good thai food - pad thai, panang curry, etc.
- the drinks were a plenty... and ice cold thai tea on a scorching vegas day is pure heaven.

the JOINT:
- janky ass strip mall, im surprised they continue to stay here
- the indoor dining room is cramped and sometimes poorly lit
- awesome AIR CONDITIONING
- wait staff and owners are so nice and genuinely concerned

the SQUUEZE:
- they have a decent lunch buffet, but i tend to order off of the menu
- they take all plastics, cash, and casino chips (j/k)
- priced reasonable for thai food off strip

come here because the food is grub and the reputation is upheld by a strong kitchen and authentic recipes... but avoid at night, and especially during full moons; keep your wallet close; and keep reminding yourself that you are still in las vegas..."}
{"text":"I am SO glad to see I'm not the only person who didn't have an orgasm going to this place.  I was starting to think there was something wrong with me.  

My client is a very well-known food critic, and knowing how much I love Thai food, he kept telling me that I needed to go to Lotus of Siam on my next Vegas trip.  \"The absolute best Thai in America,\" he insisted.

So I trust him.  He knows his ethnic food.  And on my next trip to Vegas, I made a point of going to Lotus of Siam.  And not only was it not the best Thai food in America, it wasn't even the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  Everything I ordered was way below standard from what I've had in this country and in Thailand.  Granted, I'm vegan, so my food was sans fish sauce, but still, I've had damn good vegan Thai in New York, Chicago, LA, and Chiang Mai.  This stuff didn't even come close.  My dining partner went so far as to say his food was \"disgusting.\" I wouldn't go that far, but I was really not impressed.  

We ordered appetizers, entrees, and we even ordered the famed  sticky rice with mango that several of the food critics glowed about in their articles that wallpaper the entrance (you have plenty of time to read them all while you wait for your table-- the place is packed).  Even that  wasn't good, and they didn't have to alter any of the ingredients for me to eat it.

When I came back to LA, I told my client about my experience.  He was shocked.  \"You're the only person I've ever met who didn't have a life-changing experience there,\" he mused.  

I  don't know.  Maybe it was the chef's day off.   Maybe they hate vegans.  Maybe my taste buds were off.   But last time I was in Vegas, I went to the almost-empty Thai place across the shopping center from Lotus and had a much better meal.  I guess there's just no accounting for taste."}
{"text":"the lunch buffet is usually awesome.  Great place for friends, food and conversation."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING.  Best Thai food I've ever had in the states.  Reasonably priced too and remarkable service."}
{"text":"Try and come here every time I'm in Vegas. Extensive menu and they do it all very well. Staff is helpful and provides great service."}
{"text":"Every since I saw this restaurant from the food channel, I wanted to come here to try the authentic Thai food. I've been to Thailand only once so it is difficult to me to determine if the dish is authentic or not. But I can tell whether the dish is tasty or not. Thai tea was great. The dishes were very tasty. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the dishes that I got but I will attach the photos of the food that I had. When I came here which was around 1:45pm, there was an hour wait so be aware of the lines that you need to bear before getting the great meal."}
{"text":"I been here twice and I think there food is good, but not the best Thai food I every ate. I think a lot of people like this place because you can see a lot of famous people who eat here. But I think there food is good but over price. They do have a lot of choices and such, but I still don't understand what the big deal is maybe I haven't gotten anything special here that why I feel that way."}
{"text":"I think about get some Thai food for a while so I stopped by Lotus of Siam for lunch.
I knew their food is good but portion is small and pricy.
Anyway I stopped by and found they do lunch buffet.
It's $9.99. Not cheap at all.Even though, I wnat to try buffet this time.
Pad thai was ok(taste was good but noddle was stick together) Red curry was ok(vegetable was fresh but too much oil than regular dish) egg soup was good, fried rice was ok, and fried banana and fresh fruit was good. Of course they served more food such as Thai style beef stew, egg roll, Fried Tofu, Mixed vegetable.
Also, I ordered coffee. It wasn't good.(I bet they did warm up for me cuz it was way too much hot and taste was........different. I know it's a wrong place to order coffee but still...)
Buffet is so so to me but i gave 4 stars for food not for price."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food you can find in the US. We had the Penang Curry, Garlic Shrimp, Barbecued Shrimp, and Soup ... The curry is incredibly complex with a multitude of flavors. We could not get enough of this stuff. The Garlic Shrimp was flawless and cooked perfectly to perfection without being oily.  The barbecued shrimp is served with two sauces one being spicy and sour, the other sweet.  Our waitress Tammy was very helpful and gives great recommendations."}
{"text":"Went to Lotus of Siam after reading so many great yelp reviews.  It was located in a desolate strip mall, looked a bit sketchy.  Once you walked in the restaurant, it was packed.  Even at 2pm all the tables were full.  They seem to have an extensive wine list with may good wines.  We ordered a few dishes, I feel they were all good.  The egg rolls were nice a crunchy, but a bit bland.  The spicy fried rice & noodles we ordered were good. The Thai ice tea was awesome ( I had to get a second one for the road).  Since I live in the bay area and we have soooo many great Thai restaurants, I felt this place was just good, not great like I was expecting from the reviews."}
{"text":"I entered Lotus of Siam knowing nothing of real Thai cuisine. I had only really had Pad Thai and basic curries - so my 5 star might be taken with a grain of salt.

I found the food to be delicious and exciting.

The crispy duck with basil was phenomenal - tender meat, uber crispy skin and flavorful sauce.

The sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream was enlightening. Simply but one of the best desserts I've experienced.

I also had the Pad Prick Ong, egg noodles and green papaya salad. The next time I go to Vegas I'll eat dinner here every night to explore the menu more.

Must get reservations!"}
{"text":"Worthy of the hype! Here are my suggestions:

1. Make a reservation, or you're sure to wait about an hour (yes, even on a random Monday night).
2. Order the drunken shrimp! Huge, juicy, flavorful shrimp with flat noodles. 
3. Spice levels are normal/reasonable, go with your gut! 
4. Dress casually; hella people come from the strip in taxis dressed like they're going to a $$$$ restaurant, but that's not necessary! 

Service is really nice and of course, the pad thai is also great. It's famous, you might as well give it a shot!"}
{"text":"It's early evening in LV and nobody wants to leave the timeshare.   My son makes a recommendation that Lotus of Siam might be the best spot to grab a decent takeout.  This place is excellent!  
I had a slight challenge finding this place as my GPS wanted me to enter a male escort service.  The restaurant is not visible from the street as it faces inwards in a very ragged square strip mall.  The inside reminds me of a typical bkk restaurant, complete with Thai speaking staff.  
Everyone in my family enjoyed the selections I retrieved.  Very friendly staff and a great selection which is more on the traditional tasting side.
Definitely worth a visit while in Las Vegas.  Next time we're sitting inside the restaurant to enjoy the great dishes and ambiance of this very nice off-strip restaurant.

Sawadee krap!"}
{"text":"We came here after watching Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown. Very interesting place. You will probably need a car to get here from Strip. People were lining up before it even opens on a Tuesday evening, so you should make an appointment if you are tight on schedule. We loved the crispy duck dish and the vermicelli with minced pork soup. Very yum and now we hope we have good Thai back home in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I come here everytime I visit Vegas! This place is the best thai restaurant near Vegas!  Came in 30 minutes after they opened but the line was still out the door. There were lots of taxi's, uber and lyft drivers picking and dropping people off I'm assuming visitors from Vegas. They had a cool waiting system where you give them your number and you download and app and you get to check how many people are ahead of you and when you'll get called. I deleted the app after being seated though. We were seated fairly quickly, waited about 20 minutes. Once we sat we ordered immediately cause we were starving. We ordered pad thai, papaya salad and fried prawns which was amazing! All the dishes were reeeeally good, but a bit spicy even though we ordered medium spicy on all our dishes. The fried pawns is a must to get here! It is super crispy and has a great texture to it when you bite in... it may be a little salty  but its perfect with rice! The pad thai was good... much like any other Thai restaurant. The papaya salad is a must! It is so sweet and tangy and spicy all at the same time! As a regular, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good to very good but not earth shattering like all the rest of the reviews.  

Food are not HOT, Pad Thai came without  lime, soup (Tom Yum Guon) was a tad too sour and bitter due to scrapping too deep into the lemon/ lime. 

The drunken soft shell crab was very good, though a bit too salty.  

All in all, food has great flavors but can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had.  

Service was just ok. Never saw our waiter after ordering food and then again at paying.

Oh and watch out, don't order tea, they charge $2 per cup for tea that most Thai restaurants serve for free."}
{"text":"Wow! I like but don't love Thai food. I have to say I LOVED my dinner at Lotus of Siam. It was definitely the best Thai food I have ever had, and quite possibly one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. 

We had the #14 app (crispy rice), crispy duck w/panang (red curry), and the soft shell crab w/drunken noodles.

 We were going to get the crispy duck w/mint leaves but our server suggested we get the duck w/panang since the soft shell crab had a similar mint sauce, and I'm glad he did. The panang was absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for the last 15 years, have probably eaten in over 150 restaurants in LV during that time. This would have to be on my bottom 10. Way over rated, other than a lot of heat in their dishes, lacked any difference in flavor from any chinese buffet. Crab rice should have just been called rice, I could not detect any flake of crab or flavor of crab. The northern Thai dish was a basic chow fun at my local $5.99 buffet. The only dish that was notable was the drunken noodles, however, the shrimp add on could have replaced my Michelin tires that I just installed on my vehicle. Upon leaving the restaurant, I talked to two other patrons; one in particular telling me how disappointed he was being of Asian decent. Save your money and go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's hard to get a reservation, especially since they don't have call waiting and only take calls between certain hours. It's off the strip, but so worth the trip. They actually have a really impressive wine list too. Everytime I'm in Vegas, I go here!"}
{"text":"I was somewhere near Barstow on the edge of the desert when the spices began to take hold.  I remember saying something like \"No matter how much sausage makeup and red onion perfume you put on this nam kao tod, Mr. iPod, it's still as tasty as a butch Rosie O'Donnell...\"  And then suddenly there was a terrible roar all around, and the sky was full of what looked to be huge bats, small planets, or Rosie O'Donnell, all swooping and screeching at me like they were on a diet.  A voice was ironically screaming, \"Oooh shush / keep it down down / voices carry.\"    

Then it was quiet again.  My iPod looked at me all illuminated and poured out frosty New Wave hits over my belly to facilitate the digestion process.  \"What the hell are you yelling about?\" it muttered, glancing at my doggie bag, wondering why it smelled like dog poo. \"Never mind,\" I said.  \"Everything's rosy.  It's your turn to pick a place to eat.\"  

And it was.  I was done picking Vegas restaurants.  Whatever bastard over at Gourmet named The Lotus of Siam \"Best Thai Food in North America\" must have gotten the Bangkok Special in the back because my food was as muddled as a clean-and-sober Courtney Love.  The only thing that made things worse was the lingering stench of krab meat.  (There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a krab binge.  Except, perhaps, being the drunken bastard that created this Drunken Noodle plate. Rubbery calamari, unripe papaya, and faux seafood aside, I'd name my child Shiloh Pitt before I'd take a Piloh Shitt at this place again.)"}
{"text":"Off the strip but worth the taxi cab.  The strip mall it sits in doesn't do the restaurant justice....

Quality Thai cuisine in Las Vegas.  The curry we had was amazing...Tom Yum soup was a little pricey but I think it's because the prawns were bigger than my dog.

All other foods (curry, noodles, pork belly) all put happy smiles on our face.  Plus after stuffing our face with buffet food its a nice great change.  Finished it off with some Thai Iced Tea as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! I heard about this spot from a friend a LONG time ago and this past weekend I decided to finally check it out! It did not disappoint AT ALL! Service was impeccable, the place was beautiful and easily accessible, and the food was delicious! I am a huge fan of beef panang and so that's what I ordered, along with the bbq beef salad. I also ordered some Larb and some pad thai. The pad thai was definitely the best i have EVER had! The panang was great, definitely the best I've had in Vegas. They have a friggin WINE WALL! The only problem is that the portions are pretty small, compared to what I am used to here in LA! Otherwise, all kinds of amazingness. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I would give this a five if they narrowed the menu down to their best selection. The wait is killer, but worth it. Service is always great. The garlic shrimp is something you might not want to share. It's really good. Crispy fried, garlicky salt sweetness actually makes the shell into a chip like snack almost. Everything else pales in comparison. I recommend sticking with the classic salads, pad thai and tom yum soup. I once or twice I veered off course and was a little disappointed. The curry without coconut milk tasted like a tom yum soup. I probably wouldn't be disappointed if they called it a soup rather than a curry. Their beef soup is more or less flavored for the white man's taste buds. Considering two people can only eat so much, I wish I tried something else. It was like a very sweet pho. Overall, my experience was great and I wish I could trust Yelp reviews on what to order, but everyone has different preferences."}
{"text":"Get the crispy duck. The crispy duck with basil/mint is the best of the crispy duck options."}
{"text":"This place is over hyped.  Every dish we ordered had barely anything on the plate. Lotus of siam, you disappoint me."}
{"text":"experienced some bad odours at the restaurant, food was ok not amazing but the strangest part was that immediately after eating there me and my husband experienced really bad stomach pain and spent the rest of the night near bathrooms.! it was awful! we shared the chicken appetiser, it may have been bad or something."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing!! Wait times....not so amazing. Definitely recommend making reservations far in advance."}
{"text":"Make a reservation now. Duck, pork, beef, chicken you can't go wrong! Amazing wine selection, prompt and friendly service. Don't be thrown off by the location."}
{"text":"4.5 stars - their food was quite delicious. What I love about this restaurant is that they keep original recipes of traditional foods and they don't \"fancy up\" the plates or water down the flavor. If you say spicy, it's spicy. 

We ordered Thai chorizo (sai oua), pad Thai, pad see ew, garlic shrimp, laarb beef, and crazy wings. I knocked half a star off because I have been craving Thai angel wings (stuffed fried chicken) & saw posts on yelp, but when I ordered we got the crazy wings. Regardless, we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Everyone else is right. Anthony Bourdain didn't lead us astray. 

This place is everything that is good about Thai food and nothing about what you know about Thai food. 

Some people like Arawan in the same lot... does not compete.

K and I shared too many dishes for two including some amazing fried shrimp, duck curry, a larb salad and some salty pork.

Everything here is great. Order from the specials menu and you won't be disappointed.

Also if you're a wine drinker, Lotus has a hide wine collection worthy of a visit.

They're currently moving and I can't wait to visit them in their new location."}
{"text":"The beef and tendon soup was to die for.  Strong herbal flavors (especially Thai basil), savory and spicy enough to make me sniffle constantly, and melt-in-your mouth large pieces of beef tendon.  The best part of my meal.  I didn't order it as any spice level; it just came out pretty darn hot.  And I'm still craving this from my recent week-long stay in Vegas.

I tried the northern Thai dish with young jackfruit curry (I was trying dishes I hadn't seen before on menus); it was homestyle tasting and actually disappointingly bland.  I'm a jackfruit nut; I didn't really think that the young jackfruit would taste like canned artichoke hearts -- but they really did.  I was hoping for a pungent, sweet, spicy yellow curry I suppose (fresh ripe jackfruit).  My mistake.  I ordered this \"pretty hot\", though, and it came out very mild.

A James Beard nominated chef, I would love to come more often to find more of the \"hits\" on the menu like that beef & tendon soup (OMG). I was also tempted to get that dish with the pork blood cubes...  Anyhoo, definitely a regular stop for me whenever I go to Vegas from now on.  Reasonably cheap prices for what you get, too."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is excellent. Went with a few locals and they reccomend the Northern Thai dishes that are on the menu. My favorite of them all was the curries, great balance of flavor and depth within the sauce. Great beer/wine selection. The food was worth the wait! Reservations reccomended, went on a Tuesday night and it took us an hour to get a table."}
{"text":"Best thai food i've had.  Outside the restaurant may look ghetto, but the inside is spacious.  Service is very good .

Order anything from the Northern style dishes , I tried them all and they're delish.

Garlic prawns blew me away.  If you love seafood, you must order this item!  If you're allergic to shellfish, i'd say eat it anyway and take your Epinephrine right after, it's that good.  (Take at your own risk obviously!)"}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough for this place. Best Thai food -period. End of story...... 

One problem- it is hard to get a table.  In fact, we had to wait one hour to be seated on a Tuesday night.  We also tried calling to make a reservation on a Saturday afternoon-- and could not get through.

The green chile was so good.... and the pad thai was fantastic. The service was not that great, but with food this good I'd go back to the kitchen and get it myself. 

Although the neighborhood is sketchy, the prices are good and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Boy did we have the right idea showing up before the restaurant opened, though we did eat here for Christmas dinner. There were about 30 people already in line at that time which attests to the popularity of this restaurant. 

As for our experience, the beef satay was spot on and our egg noodles in a creamy coconut sauce (medium spicy) with chicken were so tasty.

Very reasonable prices and excellent service. 

We'll definitely return during our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"WOW! Decided to try this place after all the raving reviews here on Yelp and Tripadvisor. 

It deserves 5 star. Thinking about the thousands of places to eat in Las Vegas, from bottom to high class, Lotus of Siam is just spot on when you're craving for original Thai food. I've been a couple of times to Thailand, and this food was without a doubt perfectly made compared to Thailand. 

Next time I'll be in Vegas, this will be my first place to eat! Yummy!"}
{"text":"this is probably the best thai food i've had in my life. i went to vegas just for a few days, but coming here once was just not enough! i came back a second time during the trip and took a to go order to eat after the drive back home. the stuffed chicken wings are to die for and the crispy duck is amazing. i highly recommend this place to anyone that is in vegas, but i would suggest getting there early when it opens because it gets busy very quickly. i will definitely be back the next time i come to vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place! Talk about food coma! This place is always busy. I had to wait about an hour to be seated. I went next door to the billiards and the guy was nice enough to let me use their spare phone charger. lol..... He also had a menu and reccomended some dishes.

I of course had the crispy duck with panang. Yummy! I also had the tom khai soup with that. Loved it! I'll be back for some more."}
{"text":"Somewhere I have heard Lotus of Siam touted as the best Thai restaurant in North America.

As audacious a statement as this is, I don't think it's too far from the truth.  And people in the area seem to agree.  It can be difficult to get in on any given night.



If you can get in, I suggest you start out with the following:  


19. TOM YUM KUNG-Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass & straw mushroom.  
(LEAPS AND BOUNDS BETTER than any Tom Yum you'll have ever tried before!)

Then order the delectable spicy charbroiled shrimp:  

52. CHARBROILED PRAWN-Topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce. 
(Spicy flavors like nothing you've EVER tasted before!)



You will see exactly what I'm talking about.  

Move on to order anything from this magnificent menu which includes many Northern Thai / Issan dishes you don't often see anywhere else, and you will no doubt enjoy it.


This is easily the best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand...  and this maybe even includes food I've had IN Thailand.

The only slightly negative thing I noticed was that the wait staff, though quite friendly, was not very attentive.  Service isn't a strong point here.

But call for reservations... and/or go early to avoid crowds.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"\"Pick your spiciness level on a scale of one to ten for any dish you desire.\" Hell, yes!

We would have walked the ~1.5-mile distance from Circus Circus, but it was unseasonably wet (and cold) outside. We gave up and took a taxi, which set us back by about $15 round trip, including tip. Our taxi driver asserted that the shopping center that the Lotus of Siam is situated in is the first shopping center in Vegas. I haven't fact-checked him, but it did seem like it'd been around for quite some time, especially the funky parking and overall traffic layout.

Jon A. and I picked out three dishes (with the help of our server), and I opted to try the Thai lime drink. The dishes included a bowl of Tom Yum Plar Dook (hot and sour soup with catfish, lime juice, lemongrass and straw mushrooms), roasted duck curry, and beef Khao Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles in curry sauce and coconut cream with your choice of beef or chicken, served with a side of with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables). Including Jon's soft drink, we ended up $45 lighter, including tax and tip.

Everything was delectable, but we suspected that they may have mixed up our spice-level orders. Jon's spiciness tolerance level is much higher than mine, so we ordered the communal soup and my roasted duck curry as a six, and the Khao Soi was to be a ten. However, after profusely sweating through the catfish soup and hoping I'd be able to handle my curry, we realized that the soup was probably the ten and the entrees both ended up sixes. Oh, well: everything was delicious, and I'd go back and order that soup at a ten again. The heat from both temperature and spiciness really hit the spot! And the Thai lime drink? Well, it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it was nice to cool off with while working on that soup.

Don't expect much from the atmosphere, but that hardly matters. The crowds spoke by filling up the place by 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening. (Luckily we arrived before the swarms did. And the swarms had a wait of 45 minutes when we were leaving.) The service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, but don't expect utter perfection.

The verdict: Excellent Thai restaurant! It ranks up there on my favorites. Not sure when I'll be back in Vegas, but if I do find myself on the Strip, then I'll be sure to stop in at the Lotus again."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is one of the most highly regarded restaurants in Las Vegas, and you definitely need a reservation. I made the reservation about 3 months ago, as you can't get in on a short notice (yes, you can wait for about an hour on the normal day, probably not during the CES).
The restaurant is located in the large strip mall, with plenty of parking space (however the area looks extremely warned down).
As you walk in you find a very simple interior - very appropriate for the Thai restaurant but totally not influenced by the recognition the restaurant enjoys.
The restaurant offers a full wine list with about 300 different wines. By the glass selection is quite good on its own.
The menu is very substantial, offering lots of different variants of Thai cuisine. As many others recommended before me, it might be suggested to preview the menu before coming to the restaurant to avoid being overwhelmed at the table.
As you know, Thai cuisine can be very spicy. Unlike many typical Thai restaurants, which only have mild, medium and hot, Lotus of Siam offers 10 levels of spiciness. I like spicy food but within reason - at Lotus of Siam I had dishes with spiciness level 3, 4 and 5, and they were all reasonably okay. I also tasted level 10, and for the taste, it was good, but I wouldn't eat the whole dish at that level.
I started with Tom Yum Goong soup which was excellent. Northern Thai mushroom deep was also very tasty, served with vegetables to be used as chips.
My main dish was Drunken Noodle with seafood. Noodles were very interestingly cooked and had almost charred flavor, quite unusual, but tasty. What was a bit of a put down for me were 3 large chunks of crab meat imitation sticks which I'm sure not used in the Thai cuisine and really don't belong at all at the authentic restaurant - either do without them, or put at least a piece of fish.
Sticky rice with mango was excellent for dessert, and coconut ice cream was delicious.
Overall, this was an excellent meal, but I really didn't feel that it was that amazingly special - I would gladly join someone to eat there again, but wouldn't crave it for myself.
Very good, attentive and helpful service.
Recommended."}
{"text":"This place probably doesn't need another rave review but I'm going to give it one anyway. I've been here several times, and the food has been impeccable each time. I always end up choosing something from the \"Northern\" cuisine section, but their menu is extensive and the servers are super helpful explaining everything. And, as everyone will tell you, ORDER THE CHICKEN SATAY! It's the best chicken satay I've ever had, and I've had chicken satay in Malaysia and Singapore. I've never been disappointed with Lotus of Siam and can't wait for them to open back up!"}
{"text":"Note to self: make reservation! I went there w 3 of my my friends, we didn't think reservation is needed since it's 8:30 Monday night. After 30 min wait, we ordered Thai papaya salad, crispy prawns, drunken noodles w sea bass, Panang curry w fried tofu, and pineapple fried rice.  I got mixed feeling for the food. I really liked the crispy prawns and the drunken noodles but didn't care much for the rest. To start : the papaya salad wasn't very presentable. It looked like it was the end of the batch w. lots of broken strands of papaya on a mess of a plate. The curry was dry and not creamy. Let just say for the amount of money we spent there (100 bucks including tips for all the food), this was too expensive ."}
{"text":"This is the best thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The place is a little bit ghetto and scary from the outside but don't let the outside fool you. The inside is very nice."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service is great.

Only thing was that there is only one stall for the washroom.  For the size of people inside this restaurant it is too small.  

I will definitely recommend this place but I will let them know about washroom."}
{"text":"More like 4&1/2 stars for food,  but overall experience was 5. Garlic prawns :  crispy and delicious,  but a bit salty for my taste.  Crispy duck with drunken noodles: delicious!    Soy sauce Chinese broccoli  with fried pork belly: wow!  Chilean sea bass with ginger: fish very light and super fresh, but ginger seasoning lacks flavor, should have ordered with a different sauce. Ginger chicken : my daughter liked it, but it tasted just ok to me. Lots of enticing menu items we still want to try since their menu was over 20+ pages.  Fast and courteous service. Will definitely return next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Only one word. MOUTHWATERING. Every dish we ordered was the best ive ever had. The favorite was garlic prawns, although at 27 an order it was so worth it! Came with a party of 11 and everyone loved it. Will always make a trip out to this restaurant if in Vegas. 

Come and try! You wont regret it, i promise.  Every bite makes you crave for more until youre completely stuffed and fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"I give this place an overall 2.5 stars:

The Pros:  Great customer service.  Large dining area that can accommodate lots of customers.  Delicious, juicy pork satay. Garlic pepper chicken was wonderful and they used all white meat!  

The Cons:  Prices are a bit inflated (expect to pay $2+ on all dishes), portions are tiny for the inflated price you pay.  Location is in a run down strip mall in a ghetto, shady part of Vegas.  

My hubby and I came to the conclusion that this place is overly hyped. We had better pad thai from The Thai Noodle House on Spring Mountain (Chinatown) for a few dollars less and double the portion size.  It was a good thing that we were not too hungry as the portions they served us were comparably smaller to what other Thai restaurants may serve you."}
{"text":"The best Thai that I've had in Vegas. Prices are a little steep but well worth it for the quality. I recommend the crispy duck penang, drunken noodle with chilean sea bass, garlic shrimp, and scallops,"}
{"text":"This is some fantastic Thai food.  This is basically the ultimate hole-in-the-wall with awesome food.

It's located in a shady strip mall on Sahara, near Maryland, actually really near the Green Door, if that tells you anything about the neighborhood.  Look it up.

The food beyond makes up for the area, though.  We shared the spicy Thai wings, which were amazing.  I had the roasted duck curry with a heat level of 6 (out of 10), and it was like I died and went to curry heaven.  Le sigh.

I'm a big fan of all things spicy, and I thought the 6 was just about perfect.  Hot enough to make me sit up and notice, but not so hot I couldn't taste the delicious curry and duck.  I could've probably handled a 7 or 8, but I would've had tears in my eyes.

Hands down, this is some of the best Thai food I've had.  Ever.  And I eat a lot of Thai food.

Oddly enough, they actually have a great wine list, so if you're interested in that, it's a cool experience.   It makes dinner a bit pricey (for Thai food), but it's a nice addition.

I can't say enough good about Lotus, just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sometimes gems are hidden in unsavory places. This restaurant is located in a horribly crime ridden part of Las Vegas, and set within a rundown strip mall; that being said once you walk inside you're pleasantly surprised by how clean and nicely decorated it is. I've dined here on several occasions and it is always very busy and packed with customers. During my last visit I ordered a garlic green chili prawns, and Braised Short Rib with Panang Curry. Both dishes were incredibly delicious, with the perfect amount of spice. I still dream about the Panang Curry, probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but price is TOO PRICEY. A few shrimp with garlic sauce is 28.86


I will come back though for some more."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is the real deal. I momentarily though I was back in Thailand, then realized the beer was to cold for that to be possible.  When it comes to authentic Thai food this is it.  I truly believe if I had let the beer sit out for about 15-20 minutes I would have been fooled into yelling for a tuk-tuk to take me to PatPong.  

GET : Nam-Prik-Noom , Drunken Noodle, Duck

P.S.  Pay no heed to the Cali / Los Angeles Crowd reviews, If there was a place serving turds they surely wouldn't be as good as theirs."}
{"text":"Gotta love Lotus! The Tom Yam Gong is amazing! Came all the way here from New York for it!"}
{"text":"What are you waiting for? Go, go on, There's nothing holding you back. Pick up the phone make reservations, gas up the ride, and drive to Lotus of Siam. Now! 

I have been twice so I have barely scratched the surface. Literally everything I have tasted has been 5 star. The Nam Prik Ong was the dish on Best Thing I Ever Ate that lead me here other than that I have no recommendations. Well I do have an admonition, don't get the Pad Thai. You can get that shit at home son. It is great but why waste a trip to the best Thai food you have ever had by ordering the most mundane item on them menu? You don't go to Ruth's Chris for a burger do you? No you want a porterhouse with fennel butter. Don't go to Lotus of Siam for the Pad Thai come on man.

Man... I am getting hungry just thinking about this."}
{"text":"We don't usually eat Thai food but we had very good thai food in Lake tahoe and seeing the great review for this place we decided to give it a try. Ok to be frank it was not as good the other place but it was still second best thai food that we have had. We ordered Spicy Chicken wings which were good but more sweet than spicy. We also had Catfish With Curry Paste which was good and finally drunken noodles with soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was good but the only complaint was that many of the noodles were stuck together. We love spicy so we ordered level 10 but as our server was showing hesitation and gave us the \"Are You Sure\" look we changed it to 7 but after trying the \"Spicy\" Chicken changed it to 9 which was a good decision. 9 was perfect spicy for us not to spicy that you can't eat but just perfect. There were many interesting things on the menu and would love to come back to try some other things."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an unassuming ethnic restaurant located in a strip mall in not the best part of town that serves authentic high-quality food from a James Beard award-winning chef at reasonable prices ... well, many people would tell you that you're insane, and such a place cannot possibly exist. But such a place does exist my friends. It's called Lotus of Siam - known to many as the best Thai restaurant in America for over a decade, and home to the culinary masterpieces of multiple-time nominee and 2011 James Beard award-winning chef Saipin Chutima. 

I first went to Lotus on my first trip to Vegas in 2008, after hearing continuous raves from my close friend and Yelper Jay F. They were already starting to get a buzz then, with one magazine proclaiming them the best Thai restaurant in America, and it's been great to see how the buzz has grown to Beard Awards and feature episodes on Top Chef Masters. A couple of weeks back was my first trip there in about four years, and it was nice to see that the restaurant has been expanded and renovated inside to better reflect it's reputation and quality cuisine. 

My friend and I arrived at close to 9PM on a Monday night. They close at 9:30, but true to Lotus form, they were PACKED and more were flocking in. We took a seat at the nice bar (new since I last visited) and was pleased to see a small but thoughtful selection of bottled beer (many people were enjoying Stone IPA) and a selection of sake. (Wine is the thing to come here for - they have an impressive selection and showcase their wine storage room prominently - but I'm just not a wine person.) Shortly after ordering and receiving my hot sake, we were called for our table. 

We started with 2 apps - the Issan Style Beef Jerky (13a) and Nam Ko Tod (14), which is essentially a crispy rice salad served with minced sour pork sausage and unlike anything I have ever had. Amazing. As always, we ordered both a 10 spicy, but felt these were a little lower - maybe a 7 in \"Lotus Spice\", which is equal to the \"10\" at most other places. 

For my entree, I decided to bypass the \"go to\" dishes I had tried in the past and went with a traditional Massaman curry. And that's the great thing about Lotus - they have a huge menu with some truly creative and unique offerings that will blow you away. But for the less adventurous, they offer the same traditional Thai dishes that you can get at any neighborhood Thai restaurant, and at the same price. The difference is that it is prepared by a highly decorated chef, and it will be the best version of the traditional Thai dish you have ever had. I'll put my neighborhood Thai restaurant in Manassas up against any Thai restaurant in America - except Lotus. This was, hands down, the best Massaman curry I have ever had. And this time, the 10 spicy was indeed a 10 ... several pitchers of water were needed. (And you certainly are reminded the day after that you indeed did order the \"10\")

If there is any issue with Lotus, it's that the service can be a little bit hit or miss. There was some confusion with the server, and my friend was served the wrong entree. However, after pointing this out, our server went back to the kitchen and produced the proper entree in minutes ... and it was spot on. They make mistakes, but they handle them properly and professionally. 

Lotus isn't just the best Thai in Vegas ... it's the best Thai in America, the best restaurant in Vegas, and one of the best restaurants in America. All at prices that are no more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant. Any foodie that's been to Vegas and hasn't been to Lotus can't call themselves a foodie or say they've really been to Vegas. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch because apparently dinner fills up with reservations, weeks in advance. I ordered the ginger shrimp which was very good and flavorful. I love spicy food and this was not spicy however I should have expected that. The food came out pretty quickly. The shrimp was very tender and served with peppers and onions. Overall the dish had great flavor! They have a huge menu with a large variety of Thai food to order from. They even have a Northern dish section which has very distinct flavors. My mom ordered the Khao Soi which is a curry dish with egg noodles and veggies. It was so full of flavor and one of the best Thai dishes I've ever tasted. The curry was so good that she ate it like a soup and finished the whole thing. It had just the right amount of spice so I would highly recommend it! The explosion of flavors and distinct/unique tastes really sets this Thai food apart from ordinary Thai food places. Not only that but the meat and fish were very good quality and that also really made this a much more exceptional and unordinary Thai restaurant. The meat and fish were just so tinder and fresh. The prices were also very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity and being that they are in Vegas, they are one of the much cheaper restaurants.  Came here for lunch at about 2:15 (15 minutes before closing time). The waitress warned us that we may not get in because they stop giving out tables at 2:30 so obviously they would rather be done working by 3 than keep serving people. This is probably because they have so many customers that they it won't make a difference if they have one or two extra customers. However it was very apparent that they were ready to leave because the wait staff seemed pretty rushed to have us order and not exceptionally friendly towards us. Also, it was a little off the strip so the location was not very nice and the inside was just okay too. They could definitely use some renovations to make it nicer."}
{"text":"I have been fairly stingy over the last year when it comes to handing out 5 star reviews, but after dining here there was only one review worthy.  Lotus of Siam delivers in pretty much everything.  Ambiance, drinks, food and wait staff are all top notch.  The only complaint you will normally see when scrolling through reviews is the wait.  However, when you see a wait every night of the week that must tell you that what you are in for is something special.  

I love...excuse me, I LOVE Thai food.  It's one of my favorite cuisines and it's a meal like this that only makes me appreciate it even more.  The food is so flavorful and every bite contains the perfect amount of spice.  You are given a 1 to 10 spiciness scale (which is crazy specific) and I went with an 8.  It was the perfect spice level for my entree.  

Speaking of my meal... It started off of course with Lotus Old Fashioned (many of the drinks components hailed from Thailand) and it was quite potent.  It may be a bit overpriced, but what drink isn't in Vegas?  Next, we kept it simple with the Wontons.  I wanted something fried and these were fried to perfection.  Fried and crunchy on the edges, but still having some chew and bite to them where the filling was housed.  For my entree, I went with the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle.  Typing this review has already made me hungry again and wanting this dish!  It's one of my favorite meals in 2018.  So, so good and pretty filling as well.

Lastly, the wait staff was tremendous and was a well oiled machine.  Once our water glasses went below 1/3 full we were immediately greeted by a refill.  The menu is quite large so don't be afraid to ask your server about suggestions, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.

When you are in Vegas next time, do yourself a favor and take a breather from the Strip and make your way to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Not sure what the hype is all about.  The food is below mediocre and higher prices.  I've had much better Thai food from take out places.  I think it's one of those tourist traps."}
{"text":"Finally checked out their new location in the old Roy's. I do like that it's closer to the Strip in their original place. Five stars for the food, as always, and the Riesling selections by the glass. Got the spicy-lime crispy rice appetizer, pork laarb and duck panang. So good.  They could really warm up the place by decorating the walls. I think I saw one picture hanging in the first dining area. There is a back room where they sit big parties. This room also has small tables on the sides, and they tried to seat us in there next to a table of 12, six of which were children under the age of two. Knives banging, screaming -- I immediately asked for a different table before we'd sat down, and luckily they accommodated. I really think restaurants should try harder to group like minded diners. Ask us if we'd mind being sat next to a family with babies."}
{"text":"Just completed my annual getaway to Las Vegas, which always includes a pilgrimage to the dirty strip mall off Sahara for dinner at Lotus of Siam. It still reigns as the best Thai food I've ever eaten. They've renovated and expanded the dining space in the last year, and it looks much nicer. The decor is finally being elevated a little closer to the high quality of the food. Surprisingly, I didn't think my meal was as exceptional as my last visit in September 2009. It was still super yummy, but didn't have the same wow factor. Is it the remodel? Larger dining room? Or have I put Lotus of Siam so high on a pedestal from my last experience, it will never be as insanely satisfying as my first dinner there? Wine flights are no longer offered either."}
{"text":"We came early on a Saturday night and it was packed! Our server, Bon, was super friendly and gave us a few recommendations since we were first timers. It was just two of us, but we were hungry so we got 7 dishes to share. 

The beef jerky appetizer was delicious and definitely didn't need the sauce it came with. It was great on its own. We had the soft shell crab drunken noodles, and although the noodles itself were great and full of flavor, the crab wasn't as crispy as it should've been and felt a little mushy. We had to get the garlic prawns (of course) and those were amazing. It was a good portion and fried perfectly. The khao soi (noodles in a coconut cream soup with chicken) were sooooo good! Not overpoweringly creamy and just packed with flavor. The garlic pepper beef, Thai basil chicken, and whole fried snapper were really good as well. We got a 3 as far as spiciness for our dishes and it was perfect for us. Great flavor with just a bit of a kick. Honestly, almost everything was just heavenly lol. 

We tried the mango and sweet sticky rice and it was just okay. The sauce on the rice was weirdly sour. 

Overall, we loved everything and will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. I moved to Bangkok for a bit and my very first meal on the streets of Bangkok was Tom Yum soup. I still remember this meal as one of the best in my life. 

I tried the Tom Yum here and it pretty much brought me back all those wonderful memories. 

Authentic Thai to the core.

I was also amazed at how fast the food came out and how they were able to coordinate a table of 15. All of our food came out at exactly the same time so no one was waiting.  

5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"The tom kha gai coconut milk soup was spectacular. The panang curry was not, totally too thin and lacking flavor. Not sure I would go back to this place, as it was not all it was hyped up to be and the lines are long and the service is rushed."}
{"text":"Having been to Thailand many many times... and having actual Thai friends whose families cook like 10 dishes for dinner every day.... I can tell you this place is a WINNER!

The few people here who gave it bad ratings have no clue about Thai food. Lotus is the best most authentic Thai I've had in the U.S. apart from my Thai friends cooking at their homes. I think it's the mom actually back in the kitchen cooking!

It used to be a horror to make a reservation. You would dial 40 times and get a busy before finally having someone pick up and then tell you there is no space. But since they expanded it's a lot easier.

It's also cheap.  Best thing in Vegas. Move away from the high priced strip restuarants and have yourself an adventure!  And don't be put off by the nasty mall it's in. It's down the row from the infamous Green Door (look it up) plus a myriad of other skanky businesses. Though I always like to go the the gay bar in the strip mall for a beer while waiting for my reservation time I think it's called Badlands."}
{"text":"We gathered here as return customers bringing some new friends. We told them how great it is and rushed to get there right at opening. Line very long outside. We sat and ordered and our food was delivered cold. Tom Yum was barely war Friend said he got the MSG spins. The Fried Shrimp, Pad thai, Fried Rice all overly salty. Everyone left in our party after the meal with some complaint. Party of 10. We all agree give it one more chance smaller group. 4 or less cause it cannot be this dissapounting after all."}
{"text":"As a local, this is by far the best Thai food in Vegas. We've tried it all and will always choose Lotus of Siam (even though it take about 25 minutes to drive for us). 

Must try:
Garlic prawns
Crispy duck with drunken noodles
Tom Kah Kai soup (made with coconut milk)
Thai iced tea is amazing! 

Reason for not giving 5 stars? 
The front entrance is so tiny and it's always packed with people waiting for a table. There is a very small desk for the hostess. On most occasions the hostesses are overwhelmed with the number of guests and the crowd of people. They can be a bit rude and flustered. I would love to see this restaurant open a new location that is bigger and can compadre more people. Or a second location in the west, Summerlin area.

We rarely dine-in anymore because reservations are booked weeks in advanced. Also, a reservation time doesn't mean you'll be seat at that time. Sometimes another 30 minute wait past your reservation time. 
We do take-out, and that is more timely. Just not great since it's 25 minutes to get the food back home. We have actually ordered take-out and sat in the parking lot and ate. It was way faster than trying to dine-in."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing. Nothing horrible. Just a quick place to grab some Thai food."}
{"text":"Never would think of coming in from the looks on the outside, but jus goes to show you to not judge a book by it's cover. The inside is nicely decorated with even a wine bar . Food did not disappoint. My favorites: garlic prawns and #58 marinated steak on bed of cabbage."}
{"text":"Right. So I was recommended to try new things. By this, I mean things I would never normally eat at a Thai place. Scratch pad Thai and standard red curries.

Begin food experience that went above and beyond any Thai experience I've had before. I rate the staff as the friendliest and most enjoyable staff I've had in Las Vegas. Bonus. Line when we got there, must be good and worth the wait. True.

Had the fish cakes and the jerk pork appetizers. The pork was good, the sauce made it happen. The fish cakes? Out of this world. That sauce... The best I've had. 

The only miss on entrees was the jack fruit curry for me. Still, with that said, it wasn't bad, but jack fruit, like egg plant, always is a miss for me. So with that grain, I rate the place five stars as the best Thai I have ever had."}
{"text":"the best Thai food I have ever eaten! Omg!!! This place is a must try if you're in Vegas.

Food- between my husband and I, we ordered five dishes and we cleaned the plates because it was so delicious. We ordered Nua yum katiem (marinated beef), drunken seafood noodles, crispy duck with curry sauce, papaya salad, and sticky rice with mango. Each dish were so flavorful. The only dish I probably wouldn't order again is the Nua yum katiem. It was the only dish that I felt like there wasnt a party in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, it was still very yummy. I wouldn't order it again only because they have such an extensive menu and I'd like to try new dishes.

Service- attentive and helpful. I had a very bad experience at a Thai restaurant due to their spice level. If you're from LA, you've probably heard of Jitlada. I ordered a dish and they never asked for the spice level or neither bothered to explain how spicy the dish was. It was to the point my head started hurting and I couldn't eat anything afterward. Well unlike Jitlada, this restaurant explain the spicy level and what was appropriate for each dish.

FYI- wait is always long. It's about an hour wait."}
{"text":"Vina Castallano offers public and private tasting with awesome Tapas in their \"Cave\" room.  It was terrific, very generous, double pours and wonderful chees, meats, bread, crackers, nuts, etc. The grounds are so beautiful, and offer a peaceful pond setting amongst wonderful shade trees and picnic tables.
We had 15 tasters with us and we all enjoyed the wine and sangria and the very well informed staff. 
Judy, Michael, and the gang."}
{"text":"One of the people I was rollin' with said he'd been told of a fantastic Thai place, and since no one in my group had an idea of where else to go for dinner, we went to Lotus of Siam.  I hadn't known what the name of the place was, and got excited when I saw a Thai vegetarian place in the same strip mall, but no.

Waited a while, with the employees not freaking about my friend's skull makeup and a male friend wearing short shorts, and were seated.  Not so much available for the vegetarians, and a lot of Thai places will specifically have a menu section for us herbivores, but not here.  Ended up picking yellow curry and some dish with flat noodles and fried tofu.

The curry was very very mild, and I'd wanted mild, but jeez.  You could've fed that to a baby.  Still good, though.  The noodles were great: tons of tofu, which wasn't in those chewy fried triangles you get so many places, and lots of crunchy fried garlic bits to accentuate everything.  My friends enjoyed their various dishes; one friend generally hates Thai food other than tom yum soup, but she liked that and the other stuff they got (fish, beef-stuffed drumsticks, and gross fried shrimp with their legs still on).

I'd go back, but I wouldn't suggest it, only because my choices were so limited."}
{"text":"One od the best food i have ever tasted. Try the curry.  You will not regrett it.  I go here atleast twice a year and i live 9 timezones away.  Highly reccomended."}
{"text":"My first visit, more than four years ago, was not remarkable by any means, but I decided to give Lotus of Siam a second chance.  Hallelujah that I did.

Lotus of Siam has definitely expanded since my last visit, having taken over the space next door so that the location is now huge.  I worried upon arriving, resevation-less, on a Sunday at 5:30pm, opening time, and seeing guests lined up at the door, but once I set foot into the seating area, I could see that accommodating us, along with anyone behind us in line, was a non-issue.

The menu, 15 pages with at least 10 offerings per page, can be overwhelming, so try to do your order research ahead of time.  The two of us went for the following, and boy did we hit our max:

- Nam Kao Tod (4 stars): unlike anything I've eaten before.  Spicy, tangy, and citrus-y with crispy rice (love)
- Roasted Duck Curry (3 stars): just your standard duck with red curry.  Passable, especially with other much more enticing options
- Sea Bass Drunken Noodle (5 very enthusiastic stars): at $29, definitely not inexpensive, but worth every deep-fried and wonderfully crisp, rich, and succulent sea bass bite.  Request mild if you can't handle spice because this delicious dish is packed with Thai chilis
- Mango Sticky Rice (4 stars): perfectly sweet and smooth mango coupled with coconutty sticky rice

This was most certainly the best meal of my trip.  I am not much a fan of Vegas and have avoided the city for the past four years after countless previous trips, but now I am looking forward to returning if only to eat every meal at Lotus of Siam (of course with the Seabass Drunken Noodles)."}
{"text":"This place use to be good.  I'm not sure what happened to their food and portions.   Somehow the food became bland and their portions are a lot smaller.   We had to order more than usual to accommodate the five of us and we still left hungry.   So disappointing.   I don't think we will be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Lotus really was THE place to come in Vegas for great Thai...4 years ago...

Lotus does a lot right.  They have a great menu with many options from the Northern and Southern regions of Thailand.  But they got too popular for their own good, and like often happens, the quality slipped away.  They are the quintessential spot for inconsistency in my book--putting out incredible dishes on one trip, and offering up apathetic shadows of a former self the next.  I have been over a dozen times and the last 4 or 5 times left me with this sentiment deeply ingrained in my heart, soul, and mind...when they are on though, they certainly do put out some special dishes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed dinner here. We often go to a Thai restaurant near our home but my wife thought to go here for a change. The food was similar to our other restaurant with a slightly higher price point. Service was great. Everyone there ( and there was a lot) was friendly and quick to help. I'd recommend  this place for smaller parties  (upwards of 4 at most)"}
{"text":"Decent thai place in las vegas.  heard good things about this place, so decided to see what it is all about.  We probably did not get the correct items, but we shared 3 plates, some better than others.
-garlic prawns.  fried shrimp with the shells.  crispy but not garlicky.  we probably got more shells than prawns itself.  $23, which i hoped there were more prawns.
-chicken wings.  delicious wings fried with a tasty tangy sweet sauce.  sauce was so yummy we just ate it with sticky rice.
-northern thai dish of young jackfruit and chicken.  it was soupy and light but nothing special.  spiciness was right on for a 7/10. 
-sticky rice at 2.5 each.  comes in a small bamboo container.  it was sticky and had a good texture.

service was a bit slow, we were trying to figure out who our server was most of the time...nice place, pretty big inside. lots of pics with celebrities on the wall."}
{"text":"Overall an enjoyable meal. We lined up about 30 min prior to opening and got the first diner seating."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place was amazing. We ordered the prawn with fried rice and the appetizer of fried rice that was crunchy. Our waitress was a total sweet heart and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. This is def a new lunch spot, quick service and amazing food make this place perfect."}
{"text":"Finally tried out this place after getting a lot of really good reviews from friends and family. It's by  the commercial center and it looks really small from the outside but when you come in, it's really big and nice plus they have a huge wine selection. 

The food is delectable but It's a little pricey for a Thai restaurant. If you come here you should order their Pad Thai of course. Also their short rib and garlic prawns are very good. The staff here are well trained and know their food very well so just ask if you needed help with the menu.

P.S. If you cannot tolerate spicy, just get 1-3 of 10 level range of spiciness. It is HOT!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and our decision was solidified when we saw how widely popular it is. We love this restaurant. LOVE. 

We ordered the pad thai (with a special request for tofu) and the red curry with pork, our two go-to Thai dishes that we love. We wanted some veggies, so we split the Thai salad with boiled egg and vegetables (red onion, cucumber, tomato, carrots) topped with crispy wonton strips and the most delicious peanut sauce ever: subtle heat, strong peanut flavor, nice balance of complex flavors. 

Then we had the best pad Thai and red curry we've ever had. They both had nice flavors that didn't depend on loads or salt or sugar, which can be a hard find for Thai food in the U.S. 

The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall, but the inside is bustling and busy. Celebs from top rated chefs to A-list actors have eaten there (signed photos line the walls), and the chef is a James Beard award winner. 

Make reservations to have the night go more smoothly, then go see a show on the strip. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI FOOD EVER!  no where else just like it... believe me.... i tried searching for a similar Thai place in LA

i usually stick to the same dishes, which keeps me coming back each time i visit vegas.  I LOVE the garlic prawn and the crispy rice.  

this place is a hole in the wall to me due to the location and the looks of it, but the food really proves itself.  there are even pictures of famous chefs on the wall such as Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and much more.

if you haven't tried already, your missing out...."}
{"text":"This place is on several TV shows as fantastic Thai food.  And it really is.  I wish the portion sizes were bigger given the price.  But man Oh man,  it is so so so good."}
{"text":"This place was really good, but I wouldn't get the crispy duck again. The panang sauce was delicious, but the duck itself was greasy and hard. I was very disappointed and wished we had gotten a different kind of meat. The crispy rice appetizer was great, and so was the khao soi."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I was very disappointed in the service. They asked if we wanted dessert. We said yes and they gave us some menus but then didn't come back. We had to ask a manager to have somebody take our dessert order. After eating dessert we paid and while waiting for our cards/receipts, another manager came to our table and told us that other people wanted our table, rushing us. We didn't want to be there any longer. We were just waiting for our cards. As we were leaving the restaurant we tried explaining to the manager that we would have been faster if our waiter had been more mindful of us. He mumbled what sounded like a half-hearted apology and walked off. Very disappointing experience to go along with otherwise great food."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We normally go their at least once every other month.  The food is always good and they easily handle special requests.  My only negative comment is we are always getting approached by beggars as we leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations to avoid the wait! This place is legit when it comes to Thai Food. The northern menu items have tons of flavor and what they are known for! The service was very attentive! Best Thai food I've had hands down!"}
{"text":"Incredible. An absolute must-go if you are in Las Vegas. Every time I make a trip to Vegas, I always go to Lotus of Siam. 

Despite the hundreds of celebrities that swear by this Thai restaurant, this place is warm and has a casual environment. 

Always go with the Hot Pot for the Tom Yum soup, there's no comparison. It's amazing. Try mild or mild medium. I love spicy but medium was way too spicy, even for me. The Duck Penang changed my world, and the Drunken Noodle with Sea Bass made me cry for more.

The only thing that Lotus of Siam could improve on, is the location - it is off the strip, and next to \"massage parlors\" and bars. It is situated quietly inside a large parking lot, so it does take awhile to find it if this is your first time. The first time I came in I thought I was lost, but nope. The second thing is the service. I have been here more than a dozen times, and I love the mango and sticky rice they serve - it's amazing, do try it if you can! However, it is reserved for \"certain\" guests. I have asked for this dessert every time I come here, but about 60% of the time they tell us they have ran out. Turns out they only serve it to certain guests. Last month when I went, I asked for this dessert - the waiter said immediately that it is \"out of season\" thus they dont have it anymore. However, our own waiter told us other wise, and brought it out for us. As we were leaving, we heard another guest asking for the same dessert and were told too that it was \"out of season. So try your luck next time you go in, the sticky rice is heavenly!"}
{"text":"A lot of hype (Top Chef, etc.), but this restaurant really delivered.  Off the strip location, but easy to find.  Pretty large space can accommodate many diners - we had a dinner reservation for 7 on 5/10/13.  The chicken satay was awesome - soft, well flavored chicken and the peanut sauce was the best I ever had.  The red curry chicken was very good, but even though I asked for spicy, it could have used some more heat.  All in all, our entire party was happy with the various dishes we ordered.  Ample wait staff - excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing northern tai food. Cab ride from the strip but worth it. Be careful on the spicy level. I did 4 and It was too hot to eat. Service was great and our dishes were delicious. Had the red chili dip (not spicy) , curry, garlic prawns and coconut soup."}
{"text":"I need to come back and try another entree.  This is a good Thai restaurant.   All the cab drivers know how to good to it and it was easy getting a cab back to the strip.  The shopping center is fine or average."}
{"text":"I was hoping to be blown away as LOS is touted as one the best Thai places in the US but walked away thinking yeah this is good but not 5 star good.  

We started off with a few apps and the stand out for me was the Nam Kao Tod.  The crispy rice along the spices and pork was a great combo.  Probably the best thing I had all night.

I also had the Sea Bass Drunken Noodles which was okay.  The sea bass itself was great but the Noodles were about average and didn't have a lot of spice going on despite ordering it at a 6.  Tangent ... the spice scale is never consistent so it's tough to gage if a 6 is going to burn your face off or not have any spice at all.  This time it was not spicy at all, lesson learned.

Next time I stop in I'll level set my expectations and order spicer than a 6.  

Another tangent ... the reservation process is kind of a hassle but I get why they do it.  There was a bar that served food so that might be a better option than trying to get in weeks in advance."}
{"text":"Before heading to Vegas I did a little research and I was a little overwhelmed with all of the big name chefs with restaurants in casinos. I definitely hit a couple of them and they were good but I am always one to seek out the spots off the beaten track. No matter where I did my research the one restaurant that kept coming up was Lotus of Siam. Some reviews have called it the best Thai restaurant in America. I've been to Thailand and I love Thai food so needless to say I was excited. When I called to make reservations I was told that they could only be made one day in advance. So we ended up going somewhere else but made a reservation for the following day. When we got there I was already excited. It's in a run of the mill strip mall and there was already a line out the door. We got there 20 minutes early and still had to wait 25 minutes after our original reservation time. However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink. When we finally got seated I was a little overwhelmed with all of the options. That being said as long as you make clear to your server what you like and don't like they will make sure to find something for you.  There were a couple of dishes that I tried that you would be insane not to. My top three favorites were the green papaya salad, the spicy drunken noodles with sea bass and crispy duck with pa nang curry. Every dish was perfectly balanced, very fresh ingredients, spice level was right on and the flavor was undeniably delicious.  I have not eaten at Pok Pok or some of the other famous Thai restaurants around the country but this is officially my favorite. If you're stopping in Vegas I feel like this is truly a must.

{"text":"Found this place during a business trip in the area. Service is great. Food is great. I better write a review so I dont forget this place."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai food I've had on the North American continent thus far. It definitely is in a weird location. If you follow the GPS directions you'll probably find an empty storefront. The restaurant is in the lot BEHIND the GPS location that I got. Yes it is in a creepy looking parking lot where it looks you might get \"surprised\" by some unsavory types. 

Looks aside the restaurant itself is really clean and the prices are actually on the low end given the trend of high-priced \"Thai\" food in a lot of cities these days. I assure you that the Thai food here is not the \"Thai\" food you get in a lot of places that obviously cater only to white people.

Try the blood vermicelli."}
{"text":"delicious!  happy enviornment, quality dishes, knowledgable servers.  great experience!"}
{"text":"I heard from multiple people that this place was the best so I gave it a try. To be completely honest, its still some what Americanized Thai food. I got the seared scallops and again, not that great. Still haven't found a great Thai place in Vegas that compares to the east coast. Pricing on the food is a little high for a hole in the wall restaurant. You'd expect this type of food pricing to be in a better neighborhood. You have homeless people waiting by your car asking for change lol."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with my husband as our last meal in Vegas. The food was delicious here. I wasn't too thrilled about the Thai ice tea though. It was too sweet for me. 

The tom yum soup with shrimp was delicious. The soup had the perfect combo of tanginess, and spice. The shrimp was great it wasn't chewy.

My husband had the garlic prawns. That was delicious. They fried the shell too so you could eat that as well. The shrimp was fried in a way it was still juicy and had all the spices and flavoring on it. I had the roast duck with curry. Spice level spicy. The curry was great. The duck was good in it. Loved all the flavoring in it. 

Service was good. The waitress came to check on us and see how everything was going. I would close to come back and try the mango sticky rice. Would definitely recommend people come and check out this place."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Monday and only had to wait 15 mins for party of 6.  We ordered the thai iced coffee and the lime drink, both were really tasty. 

My husband and I ordered the seafood drunken noodles which came with calamari, a huge scallop, shrimp, and imitation crab, and we also ordered the ginger seabass.  Both dishes were pretty tasty.  The seabass only comes with 6oz of fish which is pretty pricey for $30+.  For dessert we ordered the fried bananas which was good.  The only downfall is they wait to bring out all the dishes at once so some of the dishes came out lukewarm."}
{"text":"It was just average.  I think I was expecting much more from seeing it on the Food Network.  We got the signature dishes but nothing to write home about.  I have to say, they did have the best Thai Tea I have had in a long time.  You could really taste the actual tea and not just a super sweet and creamy drink.  
We got there only 30 mins. after they opened and still had to wait 45 mins.  They do get your phone # so they can call you when your table is ready which I thought was really cool so we could go do something nearby.  
All in all it was decent."}
{"text":"A crazy busy place. Food very good, service too for as busy as they were - Mee Krob, Golden Tofu excellent!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is deceiving from the outside! Please do not pass this GEM by...go in. Amazing Thai food with plenty of flavor. Loved how the waiter asked us to provide a spicy \"heat\" level for our dishes 1-10 ( with 10 being spiciest). I had the Green Curry (spice level 4 - perfect), Crab Fried Rice (DELISH and the cilantro was the cherry on top)...Hubbs had the chicken green bean  (spicy level 7-- good for him but too hott for me). Dad loved the fried duck platter as well."}
{"text":"This place came recommended to me by some friends here in Chicago b/c this place was said to be one of the best Thai restaurants in the country and had a fantastic wine list.  

I had to wait when I got there but that was not so bad as I could order a good glass of Mosel Riesling and had a book to read.  

I was a bit intimidated by the length of the menu so I asked my waiter for a suggestion that would be off the beaten path so to speak.  He recommended a northern Thai dish which had a meat-tomato ragu of sorts which one would eat by dipping thick slices of carrots, cucumber and other veggies.  Although I did find the tomato sauce to be really too much like an average pasta sauce, I did kind of like the dish and appreciated trying something new.  I did like the Thai chicken wings.

I would have gone more than once but the cab fare from my hotel (Cosmopolitan) was $20 each way including tip.  Being on a tight expense per diem I couldnt do it more than the one time.

If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll go again."}
{"text":"In 1998 I moved to Las Vegas on my 21st birthday. I worked at Casino Royale on the Strip as a bartender and sometimes just showed up at the Cheetah and jumped on the pole. There was a pomegranate tree growing outside my window on Gypsy Lane, and hummingbirds would fly up to feed at it. Air travel was wonderful in those days, so I would often take off for the weekend, to LA, SF, CO or NM. Nobody knew how amazing Lotus of Siam was, and it was my favorite place to eat.

I moved back to NYC later that year, but I returned to Las Vegas in 2003 to get married. Having seen many other friends tie the knot since then, I will say this. Las Vegas weddings are the best. Don't just do a bachelor party. Make it one big party for everyone. No parents, no kids. Everyone arranges their own travel, and then block out some hotel rooms for your guests and have fun. 

Now that you have an idea of what I call romance, Lotus of Siam is a great date spot. It's been forever since I've been back to Vegas, but I recall this was tucked into a strip mall with a shooting range, a bail bonds, a pawn shop, a check cashing and a trashy lingerie shop. Basically, everything you want one stop shopping, even if you have to beg, borrow or steal, and why not go for the hat trick?

Why am I remembering them? Because that was a seriously awesome time. They opened a NY restaurant, had a falling out with their business partner, who tried to make it fancy, and I respect that they wanted more management control, though they're so old, it was too much for them, running two locations. I appreciate how passionately they feel about the food and their reputation. That also means long waits and big crowds, so I will fondly remember those halcyon days and that delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"We were referred by friends to Lotus of Siam.  Do not let the look of the shopping center or, for that matter, that of the exterior of the restaurant dissuade your search for some of the best Thai food in Nevada.

Despite the crowded restaurant and numerous guests waiting for tables, we were quickly seated as a party of two.  The service was professional and helpful.  

We thoroughly enjoyed the Pad Thai, scallops, etc. A great dining experience for a romantic dinner for two or for greater parties celebrating milestones.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"This review is based off at least 7 visits to the Lots of Siam, so rest assured this is an unbiased and honest review.  I typically visit Las Vegas for about a month during the WSOP, so I try my best to visit my favorite Las Vegas eateries, on that list is Lotus of Siam.  

The lines form early for this place so make sure your aware of the hours that they are open.  Service here is absolutely excellent and to be honest, I've yet to have a horrible dish here and I've tried plenty of dishes.  Although, I don't quite have a favorite dish there is a particular dish that everyone should order if it's your first time visiting Lotus of Siam, and that dish is the prawns!  They are so delightful and the best part about the prawns is that they are so deliciously deep fried you can eat the head and shells!  Sounds weird but trust me on this one, its definitely a good appetizer for a party of 2-4 people.  

The service here is absolutely great, on one particular visit a friend from out of town was returning home that same day.  We had about 10 minutes to go before Lotus would close at their lunch closing at 2:30pm, so we placed a phone order and pretty much told them to prepare a lunch for 3 and they could choose all the entrees, just to make sure they included the prawns of course!  They served us a well balance lunch and most of all upon arrive to pick up the food to go like we originally phoned in, they took the the time to dish everything up and allowed us to enjoy the meal in the restaurant.  When a restaurant puts in that extra effort to create a great dining experience, that really says wonders about the staff and the owner!

Good job Louts of Siam!"}
{"text":"Regularly ranked as one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas and one of the best Thai places in the country for a reason. The menu is epic. It is pages long and full of hundreds of dishes. You could eat here every day for a year and never repeat a meal. The curries are my favorite dishes but the garlic prawns are also phenomenal. They're fried with the shells still on and end up with a potato chip quality crunch and texture. They're also swimming in garlic. It's stupendous. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I thought it was good, but for all the reviews here, it was not extraordinary.  I liked the Northern Thai dishes, and I enjoyed the meal, but what with the renaissance of Thai food in the Tenderloin, this was a pricey choice for a meal that usually is pretty terrific in San Francisco at a much lower cost.  (If you are looking for non-casino, go with Raku.)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.  Loved it and will surely be back.  We got there when they opened and the place filled up fast.  We had:
Nam kao tod, the crispy rice appetizer was a wonderful mix of flavors.  I would have ordered a 2nd one, but was soon full.
Tom yum soup with prawns.  Good heat.
Sea bass with Panang curry sauce.  A foil package of flavor.
Crispy duck with drunken noodles
Sticky rice for 4
A side of peanut sauce.  Very curry in flavor.
A side of basil sauce (same as on the noodles)
4 thai teas, 1 thai coffee and 1 soda with unlimited refills for $111
No room for dessert :0(
The portions were on the smaller side, but we left full and happy. So -1 star for that and the location.
Extensive wine list."}
{"text":"Ono food! 20 minutes and a cramped $65 limo ride with 8 other people led us to this great restaurant off the strip!

I mean, seriously. This is a gem hidden among the \"real\" Lost Wages.

From the appetizers to the dessert, we were completely satisfied. It was a whirlwind night and I can't remember everything that happened but the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. If you go to Las Vegas make this a place you visit. The wait for a table is well worth it. All of the flavors are authentic, the spice is matched well not overbearing as most places try to make it hot more than flavorful. I will be back every time I come to town. The new location on Flamingo is smaller than the original location but the original location will be back open in May 2018. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"So glad I had the chance to dine here while in Vegas.  It was or maybe is still voted the top Thai restaurant in America. It's located in a somewhat ghetto area but don't mind the location! A reservation is a must if you want to dine here. It's always crowded inside! The restaurant is actually quite big. All of the staff are Thai. This is some authentic Thai food!

The portions of the food are all small and meant for sharing. I honestly do not remember much of what I ordered (but it was tons of food) but here's what stuck out to me:

Garlic Prawns- this dish is simply perfection. It's deep fried prawns!! It was so good and it was actually the last thing that came out to my table. Easily my favorite dish from the restaurant.

Crispy Duck Panang Curry: I normally don't like to eat duck but this dish was pretty good. The duck was perfectly fried and the Panang curry was perfectly seasoned. 

We got free dessert as well! It was fried bananas!! And a lot of them! It was soooo so soo good. Literally the best fried bananas I've ever had. 

I really hope to come back one day!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, but i have to admit i was a bit disappointed. Everyone kept saying this is the best thai food they have ever had, so i had to try it. The food was a bit dry and didn't taste fresh. I understand the place is always packed, we waited over an hour for a table, but the food needs to be fresh. I just feel like if you wait for so long the food needs to be amazing. It was definitely good, but in my opinion not worth that wait. Have to say this place is really overrated. But try it for yourself, and see what you think."}
{"text":"Of course it was perfect. Best Thai food in Vegas, without a doubt. Maybe even in the world?"}
{"text":"Fantasic Thai food in a unassuming strip mall. We were there with a very large group, and they managed to handle all 30 of us quite well! We had 8 or 9 different  dishes, and all of them were fantastic. My favorites were the panag crispy duck and the seabass coconut soup, but all of them were great. They kept my iced tea full and were very attentive. Truly may be the best asian food I've had ever in vegas and the best Thai food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"the best thai food in the country!  the garlic shrimp on drunken noodles is unmatched!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best Thai teas in the area!  Worth the wait.  Line out the door when they open for dinner.  Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Anyone who gave this less than 5 stars is an amateur and should be banned from eating anything other than whataburger.  Unreal favors, textures and spice make this a dining journey that I didn't want to get off of.  Elite Yelpers like Dana, giving a 3 star, you're a moron.  The crispy duck curry...  Best ever."}
{"text":"One of the best thai food I've had in Vegas. Clean taste, fresh ingredients, very good and knowledgeable service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on our trip to Vegas cause it was recommended to him. At first I was a little apprehensive due to the location. But don't let the outside fool you! We had to wait about an hour for a table but we sat at the bar and had drinks and appetizers while we waited. Let me just say the wait was 100% worth it and I can't wait to come back and eat here again! This place was packed full of people and every table was taken. By far the best Thai food we have ever had which explains the wait! The Tom Yum Kai soup and their Thai Tea was unbelievably amazing and are both my favorite! I highly recommend this place to anyone who is ever visiting Vegas and wants a good meal! You will not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I wanted to try the restaurant and this is a first that I've ever heard of a Thai buffet offered.  As a big fan of Thai food, I thought I was going to have a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!

Located in a delapitated strip mall of other restaurants  and shops, this hole in the wall I thought.......might be a surprise and thus this is why there were so many positive reviews on YELP.  However, my experience was not such.

You walk in and the entrance is small and 3 people can not stand comfortably.  It's a small area then you're at the cashier's and the front room is dated and has painted green lattice partitions.  The rugs appeared dirty and the lighting was dim.  this is the area we were seated.  There's another section to th right of this and you can tell it's a newer updated area and open and looked lighter and cleaner.  the bathrooms appear to be remodeled and was nice and clean.

I wanted to try the buffet for $8.99 that seemed reasonable, but they didn't offer any curry dishes, or popular Thai dishes.  the variety was lacking compared to when you go to an Indian buffet restaurant.  they offered only had about 8 entrees, 2 soups, 6 misc of salad, fried shrimp chips, fried banana, fried curry pouches, apple slices and orange slices and that's it.   I was disappointed and do not recommend their buffet at all.   

they had 2 types of soups, duck soup which had bits of duck and was greasy and the other was a egg flower soup and was good.   They had pad thai, but it was nothing special, the fried garlic wings was good, the other dishes were just alot of stir fry vegetables, and a chow mein style noodle dish.  a green salad with ranch dressing, I didn't understand how this is Thai....why didn't they have payaya salad.  Overall, it was more of a chinese buffet type food then all Thai food.

My partner ordered the Pad Sew flat noodle dish, but the waiter came out with another dish altogether.  A disappointment, but he liked the dish anyway.   It was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice. 

the waiter charged us for the incorrect dish that cost more, and he wouldn't correct the bill bc he said we accepted the dish and didn't return it back to the kitchen.  He wasn't very nice about this and the mistake was most likely due to a language barrier communication.

So DO NOT go for the buffet.  Make sure you double check your order to get the right dish...best to point to the item on the menu, since English is not their first language.

Most of the dishes were about $9. to $15. per entree and that's expensive compared to the bay area, probably bc they have to ship it to LV.

I can't comment on their Thai dishes, but can say that the buffet is not worth it, and they should get rid of the buffet or expand it and keep it freshly stocked and not sitting there for so long.  No one refilled any of the pans when I was there."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place ever!!! Food & service is always great. I've tried several Thai restaurants around Las Vegas but there's no comparison. Lotus of Siam simply the best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner to this new location (just opened a couple of weeks) and was surprised that they were still waiting for true wine and beer license; just got the Thai ice tea which was still good.  When I made reservations no one mentioned that there was no wine; they have one of the largest selections of rieslings I have seen in one restaurant.  I could have brought a bottle for dinner which apparently some the other patrons were told (since it was only open less than 2 weeks).  Most of the dishes were the same as the \"old\" location but maybe lacking the nuances from the well \"seasoned\" woks and utensils from the old location.  The geometry of this new location maybe needs some tweaking we had a table in the right section near the booths and had to walk through a gauntlet of chairs protruding in into the walkway and it does not have a good flow."}
{"text":"So good! Fast service, even when busy. Very friendly waiters. Quick on the water refills big +++ for me. Tasty food, spacious location with  nice ambience. Also no wait when it seemed busy. My only gripe was the duck we ordered- very delicious but small portion for $30. Other than that this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. The location makes you wonder if the food & service will be any good at all. It's tucked into sort of a strip mall. Once inside, you get at the end of a huge (1-2 hour long) waiting line. Having been told it was worth it we waited it out and were not disappointed! The most extensive Thai food menu I've ever seen! And there's a huge wine & beer selection. Their pad tai was perfect, as was their tom yum soup. The panang curry was spot on. The eggplant was done perfectly. Yeah, we way over-ordered and had to waddle out to the car. Don't miss this; get a reservation if you can, though."}
{"text":"Went for first time tonight. We didn't make a reservations. Big mistake.  Waited 1 1/2 hours, but well worth the wait.  The best Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. An incredible menu.  Much more than the standard Thai fare.  Service was typical for an Asian restaurant, but everyone was very friendly. When in Las Vegas, this is the place to go for Thai food.  It's in a dumpy strip mall, but you're going for the food."}
{"text":"I ordered the initial En Tuon hot and sour soup with beefon tendon, sprouts, etc. The broth was nice and tastefully spicy. The beef slices, well, most of it was that fat trimmings. I think there might have been actually like two or three beef slices, and like six fat gristle.

I also ordered the pad thai extra spicy, and that's exactly what I received. However, for twelve bucks, the portions were smaller than I had wanted it to be.

The lack of a lunch special bogs down what would have been a four star restaurant. 

I probably would choose another Thai venue than this, and found this place to be incredibly overrated.

{"text":"After reading plenty of good reviews, I ignored my instincts and took the wife to lunch here.  Full disclaimer - I'm not a huge fan of thai food since I don't like coconut.  We looked over the giant menu, but settled on the lunch buffet since that's what the majority of people were eating (there were at least 10 people at the buffet the entire time we were there.)  It was cheap, both in terms of price and quality.  Nothing really stood out to me - I'm having a hard time remembering what I even found edible.  I wanted to like this place, but everything was pretty mediocre and forgettable.  Maybe if we'd ordered off the menu, my review would be different.  But I doubt I'll get the chance to try that - too many good restaurants in Vegas to return to one that left me this underwhelmed."}
{"text":"WHO: For the lovers of Thai food!

WHERE: In the Korean plaza on Sahara & Commercial.

WHEN: For lunch, they are open from 11:30a-2:30p. They are closed from 2:30p-5:29p, and reopen for dinner at 5:30p-10:00p (I learned this the hard way because I was actually craving their food today and went at 2:45 only to find out they were closed... wahh! My excitedness got the best of me because I didn't even bother checking their hours. WOMP WOMP WOMPPP!)

WHAT: Prior to coming here for the first time (Yesterday, December 9th), I have always passed by, heard from other people, and have actually seen them on TV! Thankfully one of my best friends has been wanting to come here, so we made it a Date!

We came for dinner (I heard they have a buffet for lunch *wink wink*), and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. The restaurant was pretty huge for what I thought it would be, and it was definitely ON AND POPPIN' because every single table was taken.

When we were seated, our server helped us to a glass of water right away, and constantly checked if we were doing okay. My friend and I finally got to ordering:

We both got cups of soup, which I love, because not a lot of thai places offer cups of soup! =D (Or at least the ones that I have gone to). My favorite soup ever is Tom Kah Kai (because of the coconut milk added). My friend got a tamarind base soup, which was remarkably soothing on a cold winter night.

For our main dishes, we both got curries. I tried the Musaman curry with veggies and tofu, which was extremely tasteful, my friend got the Green curry with a kick of spice- really good as well!

There were so many other things I wanted to try on their menu, but I think my eyeballs were playing tricks on me because I for sure wouldn't have finished it all!

So... GO, GO, GO! I'll probably be back in a few days because I want to try their CRISPY DUCK. MUAHAHA!

GOOD LUCK, GET THE CRISPY DUCK! =)"}
{"text":"Thai food doesn't get any better than this!!! Just be sure to make a reservation as this little place fills up at least a day in advance and e wait can be up to two hours with no reservation. We love the spare ribs and the shrimp, although we've never had anything that wasn't good here.... Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm Thai and my niece who owns a Thai restaurant in California took me here. I guess celebrities come here! 

The outside of the strip mall looks ghetto but inside is really nice. You have to drive behind the mall. They only seat you if everyone in your party is there FYI.

We ordered the famous pepper garlic shrimp. It's great. They use large prawns and detach the tail and head. 

We got hor mok also which a lot of Thai restaurants don't offer cause it takes time to make and most Americans aren't familiar with it. It's awesome though, it's like a baked fish custard. This one was ok.

Their mussamen curry was too sweet. Their dick curry was good though. Their roasted pork appetizer was really good. Get it with sticky rice even though they overcooked it. Their nam prik  ong was good. Didn't give enough veggies though. Nam prik ong is a ground pork paste that's sweet n savory. A northern thai dish. 

Service is pretty crappy. Not enough staff. Uneducated young people. Not a dedicated waiter but just a gang of people helping everyone out.

A lot of Americans here. A lot of people just looking around for celebrities. Very odd feeling that people are eating there purely to people watch. 

If you want to host someone uppity with Thai food, take them here."}
{"text":"Once I decided on Vegas for vacation, I immediately booked a reservation here. I had seen it on Top Chef and was intrigued. I live in NYC, but I feel that our Thai food is lacking.

I loved my yellow curry dish. Was the perfect amount of heat and sweetness. I wish I had ordered two dishes, just to try more things. Service was fast, decor was unpretentious, but the area was a little sketchy. We went straight from Lotus to the airport, and it was tough to find a cab. 

I am happy I was able to come here!"}
{"text":"There is no need for a long review here. The place is hands down the best thi food I ever had in my life. Outside of Thailand, I am sure it is next to impossible to try anything this good.
From the service to the volume of people they were turning... I mean .. How do you keep such quality, service and delicious food consistent? 
Will sure be back! A mosh try"}
{"text":"Hailed as the best Thai food in America I had to try the food. While I haven't tried every Thai restaurant in America to confirm that it is the Best Thai in America, it certainly was the best Thai I have had in America. Located in an unassuming strip mall from the small door that is the entrance betrays the fairly large and decently appointed interior. I highly recommend making reservations as restaurant gets packed quickly.

The best dishes are in last 4 pages of the 12 page menu under Chefs Selections and Northern Thai. My suggestion would be to tell your waiter what type of food you feel like and let the waiter narrow down the choices for you.

I would certainly come again."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here, TBH...it went down hill. All the dishes are extremely spicy, I meant EXTREMELY, almost uneatable and portions are too small. Well, I guess ...this is how they want to make money. Tom yum gain is too sour and cold, papaya salad is barely any, Thai BBQ chicken charged for whole chicken but only tiny little pieces like quail size. Good bye Lotus of siam, you're out of my lead."}
{"text":"BEST Tai food in town, hands down. Always ranked as the best for years. It isn't cheap, but it is worth it. Be prepared for a little bit of a sketch shopping center for the location, but this just adds to its charm"}
{"text":"Getting a reservation here for dinner on a Saturday night is like pulling teeth!  I ended up getting a reservation on Sunday evening.  The restaurant is a decent size but it was pretty busy even for a Sunday.  Restaurant is in a sketchy area! 

Garlic Prawns- large and tasty succulent prawns.  It was good but I feel like you can get this dish somewhere else and probably for half the price.  It's really just deep fried prawns with a lot of garlic and black pepper.

Crispy Duck in Panang Curry- my favorite dish of the two.  The curry is creamy, spicy, and was delicious with rice.  The crispy duck is good but only comes with about five pieces.  If they had just the panang curry without the ridiculous priced duck, I would get that instead.

Tasty food but I've had just as good thai food in LA for less hassle and better prices."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Thai food restaurant. Absolutely authentic with great choices. They pair their dishes with German wine such pairs well with spicy dishes. Only problem you think is the location? Well think again! There are lines of people waiting so make reservations. Once you know where it is, you're hooked. We found it in 2003 and been back ever since."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food in Vegas! Super busy though. But I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Check in first on their website to avoid long long wait or make reservation. 

Our server was very attentive and friendly. 

Crispy Garlic Prawn: the prawns are pretty big and very crispy. But they are a little too oily for my taste.

Northern Larb: flavorful 

Khao Soi with Crispy Duck: creamy and delicious. The duck was crispy on the outside and succulent and tender on the inside. It is on a lighter side.

Beef Tendon Soup: spicy and sour. So satisfying."}
{"text":"I always thought that Lotus of Siam got so much publicity and business from their reputation alone that I didn't think that I would ever come here.  The last thing I wanted to do is fight locals and tourists for a seat.  BUT, my group wanted to try them on the final day of our trip and who am I to tell them no?  So I headed out here first to snag a table for eight of us, a very hard task considering that they are always busy even after the lunch hour passes.

After confirming with the hostess that our table was ready, another group of 21 comes in and asks for a table.  Now mind you, my group hasn't arrived yet and that group eyeballed my empty table for a bit but thankfully, my group showed up and proceeded to sit down.

The things that I remembered enjoying the most were the satay appetizer, the pineapple fried rice, the drunken noodles, pad thai, and the pork belly.  They also served a dish with raw shrimp served sashimi style.  I'm a fish sashimi guy but never had I ever tried shrimp raw before.  After dipping the shrimp in their sauce, I can honestly say that I can add raw shrimp to my favorites list.  It was really good.

I can't say that their location is in the best neighborhood but the food really does live up to its reputation.  Next time I come here, I'm going for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food I've ever had.

Came here on a Friday night and the place was getting pretty crowded, even though it was only 5:30. We sat down and ordered a few beers, then took a look at the extensive menu.

We decided to order family style. 

Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai- No doubt the best pad thai I've ever had. Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor.

Pad See Ew- Once again, the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. So much flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The beef was perfect with it.

Tom Yum Kai- The broth was delicious, but my mouth was on fire! I must have taken a spoon full of spices at one time because I was dying. Still real good though.

Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle- By far my favorite dish of the night. The duck was cooked perfectly and the added crispy on top from the fat just made it amazing. One of the best things I have eaten all year.

Overall I was really impressed with Lotus of Siam. THere was an extremely high amount of hype going into the dinner and the dinner did not disappoint. Generally its hard for me to distinguish between good Thai food and GREAT thai food, but I can finally say that I have had GREAT thai food."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of accolades over the years.  Have been here many many times and stopped by the other day and figured a review is warranted.  It's okay.  What can I say.  The place closes so early, has a wait in a hallway that fits three people and there's a wait and they use so much butter that the flavors of traditional Thai are lost.  

I like it.  Nice curry.  Tom Yung is good.  The wine list is relative to the cuisine and good.  But it is what it is.  A casual, fair-priced Thai bistro. 

I hear tourists caught up in the myth of Zagat saying it is the best restaurant in Vegas.  That's just plain foolhardy.  If this place was open late night it would be better but Chinatown is no further and the selections are better.  

No knocks.  Just not going to get silly over the place."}
{"text":"The Thai food here really authentic. I ordered the chicken larb salad medium spicy. It was great and spot on. I can taste the spices and herbs ingredients incorporated in this dish. The spiciness level was perfect. I give this place a 4 star because I walked in 45 mins before closing time during lunch. As soon as I walked in I didn't get greeted immediately or was acknowledge, didn't felt welcoming at all and the two staff there notice me standing by the register for a good minute to two minutes before seating me. Probably because it was close to closing time... Overall, I enjoy the food experience."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 3 for service... average 4. 

Service... not so good. It took them 20 min to take our order (it wasn't we weren't ready they just never came by). However, the waiters were serving this big table next to us. As someone who used to wait tables I know it is easy to neglect other tables when you have one massive party to attend to. 

I'm def. willing to give it another chance though as my friend said she never has bad service there. 

The food was excellent. Most Thai places I've been too felt \"cheap\"... this was the only Thai place I've been to that felt \"expensive\" if that makes any sense... like the got high quality ingredients and didn't skimp on the spices. They get an A++ for having a dish with assorted seafood that *GASP* wasn't overcooked or previously frozen for an extended period of time (i.e. rubbery seafood). We had the drunken noodles with assorted seafood as that's what yelpers appear to be having. We also had that peanut sauce beef (beef rama) and fish cakes. All were good. The fish cakes were interesting... little better than normal but had a lot of chilis... probably the most underwhelming of all the dishes... This place has so much though that if I'm in Vegas again I'll try some more!

Funny though that only some things are marked spicy while some are not (i.e. fish cake and drunken noodles). People who can't eat too spicy food be warned... I can handle pretty spicy food and the DN were surprising (though good). I'm sure my friends who don't eat as spicy food were dying (or as she said, crying, lol) inside. I wonder how spicy the dishes marked spicy are then!"}
{"text":"A friend told me this is the best Thai restaurant in the country (USA). Well that's a stretch. The food is not bad at all but certainly it's not the best. 

We ordered Tom Yum Kung; Koi Soy (Beef Tartar); Som Thum (papaya salad); Drunken Noodle; Sea Bass w/Ginger. 

Tom Yum is ok, a bit on the sour side. My friend said not enough tamarind. Som Thum is s bit too sweet, just as I have predicted. And the papaya don't seem to be hand sliced which it should be. Hand sliced ones have different consistence. The drunken noodle is also a tad on the sweet side. Both the Koi Soy and Sea Bass are good. 

The portions are small. On the whole, it is still good. Long lines if you don't have reservation!!  Taking everything into consideration, it's ok, not a must go."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from the moment we arrived... The line was out the door and down the sidewalk and they were still 30 minutes from opening. I had the Pad Thai, which was good (not the best but good) and the spring rolls. Additionally, we got number 14, the crispy rice with sausage, and it was wonderful! So many individual flavors and ingredients- very unique. We also ordered Massaman curry, which was good."}
{"text":"Saw this place highlighted on \"Top Chef Masters\" and knew that I wanted to try it.  I was NOT disappointed.  The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and the food was tremendously delicious.  If you like Thai food, this is the place to go in Vegas, hands down.  The ingredients were so fresh and tasty.  I had the Cashew Chicken, Thai spicy ~ and I ate every bite on my plate.  PHENOMENAL!  Make sure you have a reservation.  Reservations usually denote a very pricey restaurant but Lotus of Siam was VERY reasonable.  No more pricey than the place I frequent in my hometown.  Cannot give this place enough compliments.  Now I am only sorry I live so far away.  It's one of the only reasons I would want to go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome ratings on both yelp and zagat, but i was so disappointed. My expectations must've been too high. I WILL give them props for having the *best* and most smooth Thai Iced Tea I've ever had in my life though. Onto their food? The waiter suggested their duck in red curry. The duck meat tasted a bit... expired.. and rotten. It was also rough, and the curry lacked in flavor. We also ordered a green curry with chicken, which wasn't bad, but it didn't amaze me. I've had much better green curry at any reg Thai joint back home in New York. Now... the appetizer that the waiter said we HAD to order was GROSS. It's some crispy rice sort of thing.. and it's sour, and sour, and sour, and also expired tasting. Why is it their most popular item? People in Vegas must be weird then, sorry guys. 

Oh, the lady behind the bar area was also rude. She had a huge diamond on her finger and wasn't in a uniform, so she might be some kind of owner/manager. To me though, that means you should step it up a level and be even more nice, not be a snotface. Skinny face, medium long black hair, pale, slender asian woman with a big rock -- BEWARE OF HER, she will make your whole meal unpleasant."}
{"text":"Burp!  Great food!  We were supposed to be there only for dessert but after seeing the menu, decided to try some dishes.  We were not disappointed.  Fave was the soft shell crab drunken noodle.  Service was fast.  Only complain is the tables are so near each other so it's a bit tight."}
{"text":"2 hour wait, whatttttttt?! I guess that's the norm here and everyone endures the wait. Would I do it again? Probably not. I would wait 30 minutes tops here. The Thai iced tea was excellent--it was the perfect amount of tea and creamer. The pad see ew with chicken and beef salad were also great. The yellow curry and garlic prawns were both mediocre. A lot of the prawns were simply shell and batter, no meat :( if you're lucky, you'll get some meaty, garlicky pieces. This is one of the better Thai restaurants I've dined at here in Vegas. I highly recommend this place if you have a couple hours to spare. Service was excellent and the hostesses were sweet."}
{"text":"The kind of place where I would try everything on the menu just to see their take on Thai food. Garlic Prawns were pricey but worth the cost. Pineapple fried rice was balances in a strange way between sweet and \"not spicy\" spicy. Sorry can't explain it better. But the winner for me was the tofu soup. Simple but lord the broth was PERFECT. Hard to explain but please give it a try. We arrived late into lunch and had no lines."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype created prior to coming here from my friends. Honestly, the location was a hole in the wall. From the outside, it looked pretty ghetto. However, the restaurant inside looked a lot better. There were plenty of pictures of past celebrities that has been through the restaurant.

The service was on point and attentive , nothing to complain about there.

I'm not a big fan of Thai food, but this place lived quite up to the hype. We started with a squid salad and some soup that I thought were okay and a bit spicy for someone who doesn't eat spice ... Nothing special there. We ordered catfish, pad Thai, garlic prawn, and the duck dish. Out of all the dishes, the garlic prawn was my favorite and the duck would be next. 

Overall, if you like Thai food or want to try Thai food then I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Hard to Find, When you drive/map it, it shows the back and you have to turn into the center to see it. The restaurant looks dull from the outside. Everyone was nice and the food is very tasty. The Pad Thai was good not great, the Panag chicken sauce was watery =\ I Rather go to Thai Spice."}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing. Best Thai food you could ever get your hands on. Their menu is extensive so it was difficult to choose because we wanted EVERYTHING. We ended up ordering:

1) Tempura - Very good. The sauce had a nice kick to it
2) Chili mussels - So good and flavourful. They were a good size too, not the crappy small ones
3) Drunken noodle seafood - Also very good and bursting with flavour.
4) Khao soi with crispy duck - AMAZING. The broth was light and not too thick and the duck was crispy from beginning to end. I still dream about it to this day and this will be the reason I return to Vegas. We were so in love with the food we were sad when it was time to go because we were flying out that same night. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Ate at Lotus of Siam again last weekend. Yum! Mr. Tracy A. tried one of the northern Thai dishes with jack fruit -- a departure from what you usually see on a Thai menu. It was delicious, with a spicy tomato-y broth. I'm even willing to forgive them for making a mistake with our order, because they corrected it promptly and were very nice about the whole thing. I had a #55 -- I rarely order beef with Thai meals, but the flavors were so tempting that's what I had, and am glad I did.

I would award 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me. I must say that their Nam Sod wasn't as good as other times. (Plus, they couldn't get me a simple order of sticky rice to go with my Nam Sod. They were very, very busy that day since it was a holiday, Jan 2.) But their food is delicious, with a really wide range of menu options. I'd love to be having lunch there again right about now. I suppose the one thing I would most like to change about L of S is the atmosphere -- oftentimes you're stuck sitting very near the buffet. It's great when you can get seated in the separate little room, off toward the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Though 1/4 into my meal, it was ruined.  Spiciness is my downfall, and the papaya salad that went with the seabass massacred my tastebuds.  I had to ice my tongue for the next 15 minutes, and couldn't taste the sexy food for that duration.  I think the waitress felt bad as she walked around and saw my whole group dying from the spiciness.  Unfortunately, the food got cold, and wasn't as yummy.

Plates my group ordered (1-5 scoring):

1.  Sea Bass - 4, very very good, but small portions
2.  Curry (forgot which one, probably yellow) - 4.5
3.  Duck with some curry - 5
4.  Tom Ka (I think) - 5
5.  Spicy sausage - 3
6.  Soft shell crab over noodles - 3.5

I would definitely go here again.  With a group of 6, I think we ended up paying about $25/person, which is a bit pricey for Thai, but I'd rather go here than most places on the strip."}
{"text":"Long wait but that's where the dissatisfaction ended. Once we got in, almost 1.25 hours later, the experience was awesome! Order got taken promptly. Order came very fast, the server that came with our food was very very nice. My son had fallen asleep. He woke him and was so understanding, got him back into the mood and everything. He didn't have to do it like most servers do, but this guy was so nice! We ordered the Crispy Duck Penang Curry and Plar Laad Prik. The duck was to kill for and totally worth the wait! They ran out of the Pompano for the Plar Laad Prik, but I requested for a Red Snapper substitute and it was quite good. The Thai Iced Tea served in mason jars was yummy. Check came fast and we were out of there in just about an hour. Really glad we decided to wait and try."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY delicious and insanely authentic!
i recommend the tom kha soup with noodles on the side and the #14 appetizer (forgot what it's called) which is a super tangy/savory fried-to-crisps rice.
the waiters have a great sense of humor and were super patient/accommodating with our large group and need to rush to the airport at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Only word of caution: they're SERIOUS about their spicy hot \"index\". A medium had my sweat trickling down from both sides of my face!! Other than that, flawless!!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars! Their pricing is high for the amount of food they give. Pad Thai is delish and legit! Cashew chicken was very small and wasn't filling. Each chicken or beef order portion wise is comparable to a single side item from Panda Express. Their Tom yum chicken soup was very good. I will be back here every time I revisit LV."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but so worth it.  Love the selection of Northern dishes.  All of our dishes were well portioned with excellent flavor.  Get the red curry with a side of sticky rice."}
{"text":"i hope if you are reading my review, its on your iphone/galaxy phone on your way to the restaurant. seriously, im not kidding. one of the best meals EVER, its in a shopping mall, but dont let it fool you!

the fried garlic prawns were really good!  the shells were a little weird to eat, but interesting...
 my wife and I are big pad thai fans and this was FANTASTIC!  Very authentic, not like the american version of pad thai so don't expect that!

it also has a ridiculous reisling selection, one that rivals the most high end restaurants!"}
{"text":"So I came here because my friend had seen it I'm top chef or whatever... I thought whatever...we decide to take the transit there and walk because we were drunk and it's smart that way. It was a cold dark Vegas night and we're asking asking some scandalous back Vegas road... Come up behind the place and we're like is it open...And how do you get in.. Well we wonder around the front of the strip mall and hell yes it was open open and jam packed. We put in our names and go to the over packed bar...40 minutes later we get seated.. no biggy. We order typical Thai food and it was amazing. My curry was hot... And I kept eat the \"bell\" peppers... Until I found out that they were Thai chilies... I start sweating profusely. The email waiter brings me a nice Thai milk drink to soothe the fire. I got the green curry.. next time I need to try the recommended regional Thai food"}
{"text":"I had heard how amazing this place was so naturally had to try it. The entry is full of magazine articles that feature them, awards they have won, and famous celebrities who have dined there. After this, you would expect the food to be something spectacular, which I must say it was pretty ordinary. The menu is huge, so I'm sure people who know more about Thai food would have a field day. I personally always stick to a curry, so I had their yellow curry, a soup, and the pineapple fried rice. Everything was great but I don't know that I'd recommend it anymore than the next Thai place. Service wasn't outstanding either."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food.  I love Garlic prawn and Larb Squid.  Food is great but a little bit overprice with small portion.  It's a very busy restaurant, make sure to make a reservation 2 days in advance ifnot you have to wait at least 2 hours."}
{"text":"This new location is simply beautiful! The best part is that the foods are pretty much the same. Some reviewers cast doubt on how good this place is. Personally, I believe this is one of the best Thai restaurant in the US. I didn't eat their Northern Thai dishes. I have my personal favorites, including the garlic prawns, sea bass with drunken noodles, BBQ beef, papaya salad and Tom yum soup. These dishes were magnificent. The portion remains the same as the other restaurant but the price is a dollar or two more. Overall, this place is so good that started waiting outside the restaurant at 3:40pm when it opens a at 5:30pm. For #Thinsulin fans, there's plenty of choices."}
{"text":"The most overrated Thai restaurant in the country welcomes back Dan P.!  I was encouraged by the likes of Ryan D. and new acquaintances at Khoury's to give the \"best\" Thai restaurant in Vegas another chance.  So I made my third visit.  Today, Lotus redeemed a star.  However, I am sorry to say that its still overrated and I doubt I will return for a fourth visit.  We had the roast duck curry, the green curry with beef, and the pad see ew.

My favorite was the roast duck curry.  This is the dish that has inspired other restaurants like Thai BBQ and Stick E Rice to make the Americanized red curry with cherry tomatoes, grapes, and pineapples.  I think they both do it better.  The curry was sweet, but had some flavor to back it up.  The portion was ridiculously small, and the duck meat, while good quality, was skimpy.  This is an above average, Americanized duck curry that I guess I would recommend if you aren't familiar with authentic Thai food.

Next up was the pad see ew with pork.  The pork was a bit tough, but nothing to complain about.  What little Chinese broccoli there was in this dish, wasn't rotten this time, so that was a plus.  This is a very saucy pad see ew, and sweetened.  Good for the general public, I suppose.  Not a bad dish, but I prefer a drier pad see ew.  You can get a much better version of this next door at Komol with huge portions of fresh Chinese broccoli.

And on to today's joke, the green curry.  This is one of the weaker green curries I have had. The beef was a little on the tough side.  There was potential with well balanced and interesting spices in the curry, but the curry itself lacked any real backbone or character.  It was quite watery in taste.  I had to add chili powder to make it enjoyable.  If you are a fan of green curry, you might want to skip this one.  Again, the portion was small.  

As with most Americanized Thai restaurants, don't be afraid to order really spicy to have a bit of heat.  I could eat a 10 here and not break a sweat.

LoS gains a star for not having rotten Chinese broccoli, and taking that terrible Northern Red Curry off of their new menu.  Unfortunately, this place is still on the bottom of my list as far as Thai restaurants in Vegas go."}
{"text":"This dish converted me to not only loving Thai food, but to love curry...  

CRISPY DUCK with PANANG
Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac.

UFB!!!"}
{"text":"Great chef, horrible wait staff and management. The waiter was a socializing so long that our food was cold by the time it came out (10 minutes after the table next to us got theirs, who came in 10 minutes after us). Too bad, the food tastes great, but was legitimately cold. We were starving so we ate half before we sent it back. It's a shame because chef is great but wait staff ruined our meal. Will stick with Chada Thai and Wera Thai, with great chefs and great for wait staff from now on."}
{"text":"nom nomz. heard about this place through a friend who wanted to go try it. checked it out on Yelp and it is probably the highest rated Thai restaurant in all of Vegas. my group figured we HAD to go before we left Vegas. plus, i love Thai food anyways. 

Be prepared for an early dinner or plan when you're going and make reservations (you need to make them at least 7 days in advance). the restaurant opens at 5:30PM and the line is no joke. my friends and I had a large party so we got there at about 5PM and started waiting in line. I thought it was ridiculous that we went so early since we were the only ones waiting in line. lo and behold, 10 minutes later, the line was down the block. doors opened at 5:30PM and the reservations line gets seated first. then my party was first in line to get a table since we got there so early. i looked around as we ordered and the restaurant filled up quickly. 

the restaurant is known for it's northern Thai food so leave the traditional Pad Thai at home. my party decided to order a bunch of food and just share it family style. we had 2 orders of their garlic prawns, the chicken khao soi (chicken served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry base sauce, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables), nam kao tod (Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice), drunken noodle soft shell crab, panang curry with crispy duck, and a beef dish... I believe it was the Pad Prik Sod (Choice of meat sautéed with bell peppers, fresh chili pepper, & onions). we all also ordered the Thai Iced Tea which is delicious and highly recommended. I love that you can really taste the tea flavor yet it was still sweet and creamy. 

when the food came, we were all ready to chow down. they also gave us a basket of rice and said that if we needed more, we could just ask. the dishes seemed small but for some reason, we had a party of 8 and were still not able to finish all the food. everything was amazing and tasted super fresh. I would definitely recommend the garlic prawns and any dish with the crispy duck. 

of course we all wanted to get a dessert before we left so we ordered one mango sticky rice to share amongst us. the mango was so ripe and sweet. the coconut sticky rice was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of sweet coconutty aroma to balance out the mango. i normally dont like sticky rice desserts but I can definitely come back for this one! 

overall, amazing food, great service, nice atmosphere. the restaurant looks deserted in the middle of an empty plaza if you arrive early, but don't judge a book by it's cover! I can see why it's the most highly rated Thai restaurant in Vegas. you have to give it a try if you're in this area! Truly unique restaurant that you would never imagine to find in all the glitz and glamour of Vegas."}
{"text":"Thai food at its finest. The service and ambiance is perfect and the food is truly delicious. It looks shady from the outside but once you're in you're sold."}
{"text":"The food is really good at this restaurant in a run down shopping mall in a bad neighborhood about a mile from the good hotels in Las Vegas. No ambiance but there was a long line to get in.  You will need a reservation!"}
{"text":"The crispy duck curry is my favorite, followed closely by the pad thai.  Sortof reminds me of one of those places with secret prostitutes and mahjong parlors filled with old people (yeah I know it's not a Chinese restaurant).  The waiter was very friendly and didn't mind describing the menu items.  Make reservations, they are pretty full."}
{"text":"Every single guide book touts this place as the bomb.  Why is that?  Sure, they admit that the place is a hidden away in a shopping plaza and doesn't look like much but that the food is phenomenal for the price.  It was ok but not quite what the guide books say, which makes me wonder if they got a kick-back for touting this place.  I was just expecting something different.

We went for lunch.  The food was ok but not the best I've had.  We went with the buffet to have the opportunity to try new things.  It was ok.  Maybe only 1 item on the buffet had any protein in it; most everything else was noodles, rice, and vegetables only.  We were there in the last hour and a half before lunch closed, and there were two buffet items that they never refilled.

The service was nice but not necessarily the most prompt or attentive.  Twice I had to go seek out my own napkins, and we waited a long time to flag down anyone to ask for the check despite the fact that it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had outside of Thailand.  Highlights of the evening include Garlic Prawns & Crispy Duck in Red Curry (spicy alert)."}
{"text":"5 for food. 1 for portion size. My tip: Leave your appetite at home. (Just got done with dinner here, now I gotta go get a burger)!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that my favorite Thai restaurant has opened such a beautiful location where I can enjoy my favorite dishes in a lovely atmosphere!
Everything was extremely delicious!
I can't wait to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of our favorite restaurants to visit every couple months when we are in Vegas. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. I recommend going here with a party of four or more so you can truly enjoy and sample all of the tasty food."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me saying it was the best thai food ever. After doing some research on the place, I found out J. Gold has said this is the best thai place in north america! I was sold. 

I did a lot of research on what to eat and the people I went with don't eat fish but here is my take on our picks:

drunken noodles with minced chicken - the version on the menu is with seafood so you have to request it but I'm so glad I got it with the chicken instead! it complemented the noodles perfectly. the flavoring and everything was spot on and was probably my favorite dish of the night

spicy pork stew - this was probably the spiciest dish we had. we tried to keep the spice level at a low since one of our friends isn't a spice eater but it still definitely had a kick. out of all of the reviews I constantly saw this dish on the must try list. surprisingly, this was my least favorite dish. since the name has stew in it I figured there would be more of the curry sauce but it was mostly pieces of pork covered in a curry sauce. it was still good...but not a must try for me.

crispy duck with chili and basil - this is a must eat if you love duck. soooo good!!! it's mostly duck skin and very crispy.

cashew chicken - this was good but nothing special. I read that if you eat here and you want to be blown away you should stick to their specialties: northern thai food. so stay away from anything typical like pad thai or in this case cashew chicken. BUT it was still a delicious item and I had no complaints about it.

coconut ice cream with fried bananas and sticky rice - I had read that their sticky rice with mangoes is one of the top desserts in the US. Unfortunately, mangoes are not in season in the winter. I was sooo sad. But the waiter recommended this dish which blew us all away. the coconut ice cream was super refreshing and not too coconutty and the sticky rice was PERFECT. I'm drooling just thinking about it....

Thai Lime Drink - If you like limes you'll love this drink. It tastes like the vietnamese lime drink to me so it wasn't anything special cuz I drink it everytime I have pho but I love limeade so if you've never had it, definitely order this!

overall, we all had a great meal here and I will definitely be coming back to try some other dishes next time I'm in vegas. Is it the best hai food I've ever had? It might be! I will need to try some more dishes to be sure. The bad part is this place is closed for lunch on the weekends so plan accordingly. Next time I go, I will be trying the crispy rice with sour sausage and the spicy chicken wings! Can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a regular Thursday night.

Pros:
Wow, the food, truly the best Thai food in North America.
The food.
Food.
Wine list. 
Local feel.
Great service.

Cons:
Not much, maybe the location, not far off the Strip but contributes to local Vegas feel."}
{"text":"I got the crispy duck khao moi and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best dishes I've had across different cultural eating. Great spice for me personally at 6/10 stars. I probably could have done the 7/8 but I didn't want to ruin my first experience by overdoing it. The duck was very crispy on the outside and the meat was still tender and juicy. The flavor of the curry was great and wasn't just spice. The noodles and pickled vegetables were a good balance to my palate. Great dish. Only comment on the bad side is that he cost of this dish is in the high 20's so I wanted to order more but would have ended up having a tab of almost 70 bucks for two dishes and an appetizer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place 3 years ago for the first time.
It was good, but doesn't make me crave to go back.
The best dish was the duck probably, even though I don't really like duck."}
{"text":"Thank you to Chef Saipan Chutima for coming to Las Vegas to share such soulful food with our city's growing culture. I am still so amazed with the flavors in his Tom Ka Gai and the complexity of flavors in the drunken noodles with soft shell crab. My mouth is watering as I type this review.

Prices are a tad bit higher than your usual hole in the wall Thai joint but I would pay more to be transported again through food. Lotus of Siam has been visited by world renowned chefs, artists and actors alike and am so happy I had the chance to dine here. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Southeast Asia and live in the melting pot known as the Bay Area...this is the best Thai restaurant i have been to outside of SE Asia!!!! The Bay Area has nothing which compares!!! The soup is amazing and their shrimp dishes are beyond compare!! Order #52!!! Fresh seafood and amazing people!"}
{"text":"This place has got more accolades and awards from reputable sources( Zagat, Gourmet, etc.),  than Mel Gibson has hate mail and I am happy to say that they are well deserved.

Although they have some safe and Chinese inspired dishes, which I think they should cut from the menu, their specialty is Northern Thai and the surrounding regions. Dishes can be small but that can be an excuse for your party to try more things. You won't regret it.

Don't confuse this place with some of those Thai places that try to be gourmet but stray too far from authenticity. This is real deal, gourmet Thai cuisine. Take it from me or not but I am Thai and have been to Thailand many times and I think I agree with the writer from Gourmet Magazine that this is \"The best Thai food in North America\". I 'll even go as far as saying it is better than most restaurants in Thailand.

The service id good, plating is nice and decor is pretty crappy but it doesn't really matter when the food is this good.

Price $20-30 per person for dinner. 

It's located in a dodgy strip-mall consisting of massage parlors and shady looking bars, restaurants and all the riff -raff they attract but I'll gladly dodge a few bullets to eat here again.

I give Lotus of Siam 5 stars based on the taste and quality of it's food. I usually reserve this for ultra elegant, flawless in all ways, destination restaurants. I will make the exception because this place is truly in a league of it's own because of how far the taste and quality exceeds that of any other Thai restaurant I have been to in the United States."}
{"text":"We cabbed it here from the Vdara and it was almost about 20 bucks.  This better be some damn good thai food.  20 bucks is like a whole hand of blackjack and that means a lot to my asian blood.

Anyhoot, we arrive at a non-descript strip mall in the middle of no where.  I didn't even notice the restaurant and asked the cab driver 'Are you sure this is it?' because he dropped us off at an indian restaurant next door to lotus of siam.  we finally walk in and instantly surprised by the size and decor of the place.  it's got a nice wine section and the restaurant was packed for a Sat night.  Reservations only so call ahead to be sure they have space.

On to the food.  Literally the best mussaman curry I've ever had.  I'd pay that same 9 or 10 dollars just for the curry sauce with a bowl of white rice.  just enough heat on the curry and the beef was super tender.  We also the old stand by pad see ew, except this was the best I've ever had.  noodles still had nice life to them (weren't sauteed until it was mush) and the greens were fresh and crunchy with a tart bite.  Loved those two plates.  We had also had the garlic shrimp and beef salad.  both were very good, but not outstanding like the pad see ew and mussaman curry.  The weakest dish was the appetizer.  It was the nam kao tod (the crispy rice appetizer everyone raves about).  It was ok/good for me.  Has a strong salty/sour flavor component with the crispy rice texture.  Good when eaten with the garnish, but still overpowering with the salt.

Overall, awesome thai food.  Take a couple of green chips from the blackjack table and stash them away in your pocket.  might be fun gambling it on cards, but for that same amount of cash, you're guaranteed some awesome thai food off the strip and that's a win in of itself."}
{"text":"This is definitely a good stop on your Vegas trip if you're hankering for legit Thai food. We came in after a rainy RV tour in the desert and they quickly accommodated our large party. I ordered a duck noodle and it really hit the spot. We enjoyed all of the food and no one had any complaints. The service is slow and you have to be patient, but with that in mind, it's definitely a great spot off the strip."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. The absolutely best thing was the duck Penang. Never had crispy duck in a Thai restaurant before, and the meat wasn't too fatty/boney! Service was impeccable, they sure know how to handle the Vegas tourists. The crab fried rice and the papaya salad were also among my favorites. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the sausage. Nam Kao was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants around, especially if you are looking for authentic northern style Thai food. Some of their dishes are better prepared than what one can find in Thailand. The sea bass, although not a traditional dish, is always tasty. The papaya salad Laotian style is hard to find and definitely for the more adventurous. Laotian style tends to liberally use fermented crab, creating a stronger fishier flavor. It's also usually spicier. You can't go wrong with their Larb or their curries. I have yet to have a bad dish there."}
{"text":"Wow - this place is definitely worth the hype!  A group of 10 of us ate here last week and enjoyed so many different things on the menu.  The standouts for me were the chicken potstickers, satay, rad na, pad see ew, yellow curry and the crab and pineapple fried rice.  The menu is extensive, so my friends who have eaten here before selected our food for us and they didn't lead us astray.  The lemon sake we had with our meal was downright incredible too.  This is certainly a place to check out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai in Las Vegas.
It's located in a honestly run down looking shopping center, but they keep the interior nice and classy.  
The wait can be long sometimes at dinner, but the food is worth it.
Portions are big, and they don't scrimp on the food, for example, a seafood dish will definitely have more than just 2 shrimps, unlike some other restaurants.
I'd also suggest going to their lunch buffet if you want to get a sampling of their foods."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lotus since moving to Las Vegas 17 years ago and almost always gravitate to the d the steamed sea bass with ginger seasoning.  This dish is a true delight...always very high quality fish, usually prepared to preserve the delicate texture of the fresh fish and usually well seasoned.The bass is served on a bed of steamed veggies.  The Tom Yum Kai hot and sour soup with chicken, lime juice, lemon grass and straw mushrooms is spectacular and consistent in quality.

Several years ago Lotus did a large expansion,  started catering to tour buses, and in my opinion, at the expense of small groups and locals.  That change has resulted in service screw ups, including forgetting parts of an order several times, being served the wrong entree,  unusually long waits for the arrival of food and at times wait staff that was non-communicative at their best and outright rude at their worst.

Combine the above with the inability to make reservations online or by phone prior to their opening time each day, the inability to get anything but a busy signal once they open, and the mass feeding frenzy created by bus arrivals that has lowered the ambience from mediocre (hey, for years it's been about the food in spite of the mediocre ambience) to an ambience somewhere between an Army mess hall and a bus station waiting room, I've given up on going to Lotus.  When they're good they're really really good and when they are bad they are terrible.  In the past two years they have typically been close to or at terrible.

One way to enjoy the typically outstanding food is to order carryout.  I was uncertain the first time because I didn't know how well cooked fish would taste after a 20-minute car ride, but the answer is that is was excellent....excellent enough that we've used the carryout process several times recently."}
{"text":"I like this place and have eaten here many times over the past 8 years. It is not the best in Las Vegas as some people say but it is still a great option. It's located in an old shopping center near the strip but it's convenient and there is a lot of parking nearby. The service is always good."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about but this is not authentic Thai food.  Is the food good?  Most of the time yes (depends on the dish) but it's not authentic Thai."}
{"text":"As you walk in, there are many articles from magazines and newspapers in many different languages, stating how great this place is! Venturing in even further, the walls are adorned with celebrities who have eaten here as well. Needless to say, after trying the food, we understood why.

Lotus of Siam is a not-so-hidden treasure just off of the strip. If you like authentic thai food, then this place is calling your name! They also have an amazing wine selection to complement the meal.  Everything we ordered had amazing flavors and depth. This is the type of food that keeps people craving more!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in North America for sure.  Be sure to order off the back of the menu in the \"Chef's special recommendations\".  The sea bass Tom Yum tastes like lemongrass scented butter.  The Panang Curry short rib is also one of my favorites.  I have found that it is best to go with a group of 4+ so you can taste various items on the menu."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai restaurant in the entire country! I've been to so many Thai restaurants I can't even count, in places as far flung as Seattle, New York, DC, NC, and TX. Bar none, this place is the best. 

It's in an old and little strip mall, but don't let that fool you. This place rocks. 

I went for dinner on a friday night and basically our whole table didn't order off the menu. We just told the waiter that we had never been there, and to bring out an assortment of their best dishes. A little risky, since there are a number of specific food items I will not eat - but boy was the risk worth it. We had the most amazing food, and unfortunately because we didn't order off the menu I can't tell you what we had. 

Go with a group, have the chef make whatever his favorite dishes are, and you will be awed."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in the U.S. Come early because the longer you wait, the longer the line is. Please only order the northern thia dishes, they are located in the back of the menu. Northern Thai food is what there known for."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place when I saw it on the food network's best thing I ever ate. Went on a Wednesday afternoon when it opened. We were on luck no line. Promptly seated and poured over the extensive menu. Being from LA there are a lot of good Thai restaurants  to compare this place to. So we ordered the papaya salad, which was spot on with the balance of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy. My only complaint was the portion was a little small especially for the price. The red chili dip we ordered was ok. Nothing memorable. It was definitely missing a little heat. The vegetable fried rice was ok, and the drunken noodle I could have passed on. Nothing really wowed me. I could get better in Thai town in hollywood. We ate all the food, but the reason for that was the portions were so small we left feeling starved."}
{"text":"Went there with two of my friends who had been there and raved about it. So I had quite high expectations on top of the fact that I'm Thai. Among the 4 dishes ordered were the 2 most popular dishes, garlic prawns and crispy duck panang. Crispy duck Panang was really good. The duck was crispy like everybody raved about, and the Panang was flavorful and wasn't on the sweet side like many Thai restaurants tend to make. Garlic prawns, however, were bland. We tasted no garlic flavor. Worse, it felt cold as if the dish was done way earlier and just sat there on the counter waiting for other dishes (they served all the dishes at the same time!). And maybe because it's on the cold side, the prawn shells weren't as easy to eat as my friend had remembered. The prices for these two special dishes are also quite outrageous ($26.95 for crispy duck panang and about the same for garlic prawns). The other two dishes we ordered, Kang HangLae (northern food) and spicy fried rice were yummy. The service was also excellent. 

Overall, I'd give it a 4 star. Their dishes are good, but I don't think it's anything too memorable for me (as a Thai) and the prices for their special dishes are way too much. I'll definitely go back if I were in Vegas area to try other northern dishes (as the Thai waiter said they are good), but won't order their special dishes again."}
{"text":"2nd time here in one week. Speaks for itself...1st time had crispy duck panang & this round crispy duck with drunken noodles. Both time garlic prawns. 

Absolutely the best Thai food I've ever had. By far. Make sure to check out the northern Thai specials toward the back of the menu. If you order pad Thai you should be shot...just saying. You won't find this back home at your fave Thai joint. Must try garlic prawns, freaking exceptional, do not forget to try this dish.

This replaces my prior last meal, which stood for almost a DECADE, Shensei, in Dallas TX. I am not embarrassed to say I ate ALL of both entrees, both times.  Wait, I know what you are thinking... try to work on that profiling, critical trait you have.... lol. You can't see my pic & presume I am a bigger gal. NOT. 5'5\", 115 lbs. My intention was to take home for an additional meal. But food of this quality is food coma worthy. I am a big time foodie & I have been this glutenous a couple times in my life.

If there's a wait, wait. It will be worth it. The finest food with superior service, wait. Sonny was my waiter. Very good service. For a second, he tried to let me know I was ordering a lot. I told him I had eaten 2 entrees a prior visit. Not another word, just smiled & whipped it out. Perfect timing, water glass kept filled, checked in at exactly the right time, Sonny does it right...

Yes, a tad pricey but worth every penny & more. Should be #1 on your Vegas dining musts. 

I will battle to not return a third time this week....lol"}
{"text":"Always great food.  Wait was long, especially on a Thursday night, but the food was great."}
{"text":"So good!!!! The soft shell crab is absolutely wonderful. There is a reason they have won best of Las Vegas like 100 years in a row."}
{"text":"Being Thai myself, this place definitely lives up to all the hype. It is really authentic Thai food that taste amazing. I eat Thai food all the time and can say that this place has really good Thai food. Huge menu full of all types of food from all around Thailand. Last time I was here, I had the crispy duck drunken noodles which was delicious. Duck was super moist and the crunch on it made it even better. On weekend's they are only open for dinner so make sure you make reservations ahead of time because the wait can be extremely long."}
{"text":"One of the most talked about restaurants in Vegas, and that's quite a feat given the amount of amazing restaurants this city has to offer.  Tried to come a few times, but didn't want to deal with the long wait.  However, I finally managed to try this place during our last trip by coming here for lunch.  This might be a controversial statement, but I think Arawan across the parking lot is better on the account of flavor and presentation.  However, Lotus of Siam is definitely nothing to sneeze at, it is a delicious Thai restaurant (I am just not sure it would be worth the hour long wait).  

There are nearly 4000 reviews, so I am sure I won't say anything here that hasn't been said before, so I will try to keep this brief.  Out of the dishes we tried, I really loved:

Khao Soi Soup - it was absolutely delicious, just the right amount of creaminess and heat.  We had it with chicken, although I wish we got the duck instead.  

Garlic Prawns - I can see why this is a signature dish, wow, just wow.  The breading was light and crispy.  The prawns themselves were good sized, plump and juicy.

Conversely, I had high hopes for Nam Prik Ong, and it was such a let down.  The dip lacked depth as I've had elsewhere, and the flavors did not mesh well together.  It was the one dish that we barely touched on the table.

Overall, I am glad I got to try this place after hearing countless friends rave about it.  It is rare to find authentic and delicious Thai food, would definitely come back again,albeit only for lunch due to the lack of wait time."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and it definitely lived up to the hype! We were all about the garlic prawns, chicken wings and crispy duck (so good we needed an excuse to get more duck which prompted us to order both the curry and the noodle). They were way better than I could have ever imagined, I don't think I could pick a favorite between the three. On top of the amazing food, the service was great! We had a rather large party of 12 and they were very attentive in checking up on our orders.

The only downside was our garlic prawns came out around 15-20 minutes after we had already finished everything else that was ordered. But once we took our first bite after it had come out hot and fresh, most was forgiven."}
{"text":"Went again in July 2011.

Had the Nam Prik Ong as seen on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  We just thought it was okay.

But got our garlic prawns, pad see ew and both were on point.  We added spicy chicken wings and my wife wouldn't share.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Not much more can be said about this place that hasn't already...just a quick update: the wine cellar that is under construction is almost done...the current wine list is a fraction of what they have...the full list that can be seen online will be available once the cellar is finished.

Also, don't order anything specific off the menu...trust your waiter/waitress and let them order for you.  You will not go wrong."}
{"text":"I remember reading a food blogger's thoughts on eating at Thai vs Chinese restaurants.  EXCELLENT Chinese cuisine is a rare find, but you will be hard pressed to find a bad Thai joint.  Excluding some specialty items, the general menu tastes like common Thai fare.  We had the Nam Prik Ong (it is an Asian version of crudités served with a shrimp paste which is fishy, salty and sweet, very similar to the Filipino Bagoong), A Pork BBQ dish, Green Curry and Phad Thai.  I enjoyed other places' versions better (eeep).  Although their prices are cheap, very reasonable.

I guess what really sets this place apart is its impressively extensive wine list.  From a humble entrance with waiting times lasting up to 2 hours, you are greeted by a large cellar filled with wine from around the world.  I'm not sure how these pair perfectly with Thai cuisine but I'm thinking any wine aficionado will enjoy this visit.  So go for the lobster, sea bass and German wine.  Otherwise, you can always get seated immediately at the numerous Thai options in Vegas.

{"text":"3.5 stars

Lotus of Siam has probably become one of the most famous Thai restaurants in the country, if not the most. Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.

GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.

STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.

TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.

COMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound.  The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.

SEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish. The sea bass was excellent. Lightly fried, the fish was moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness. The noodles were very good as well, with some heat from the chili and a nice herbal sweetness from the basil.

I don't know a whole lot about Thai food so it's hard for me to really draw comparisons. I found this to be a pretty good meal, with the drunken noodles and sea bass to be a big highlight."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food in town.  Great selection--Garlic Prawns & Papaya Salad (Laos-style) are a must-have!  Not the best area, but always worth a visit.  Book early or be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai, chicken skewers, won ton soup, and fried rice are our favorites!! There is honestly not a bad thing at this restaurant. Service is incredible. The only downside is it's extremely difficult to get into during dinner hours, lunch is a lot easier to get a table without a reservation."}
{"text":"Sets the standard for Thai food not just in Las Vegas but anywhere.

Everything on the menu I have ordered over 10+ visits has been outstanding.  Thai-loving friends and colleagues from around the world are always blown away by this place.  

1)  Nam-Prik-Noom - this \"dip\" is spicy, pork- and green-chile goodness with all kinds of things to dip in this bowl of pure joy.

2)  Egg Rolls are outstanding.  Perfect balance of crisp inner and outer without a ton of grease.

3) Thai Pigs in a Blanket which are deep fried prawns wrapped in bacon deep fried.

4)  Curry curry curry - All of them.  I started with the Reds, then the yellow, then the green.  All are awesome.  Venture over to the Northern Thai curry menu for a different curries.  So yummy.  

5)  WINE - Their wine list is outstanding and reasonably priced--especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"best Thai food I've ever had in my whole life!!!!!

my bf and I went here during our spring break trip to Vegas. he heard of this restaurant from a Foodie friend and really wanna take me here. I was not very impressed during our first visit as the restaurant is located in a shady, shady, shady neighborhood. we arrived there at 3pm that afternoon only to find that the restaurant only open for lunch 11ish to 2:30 and dinner starting from 5:30pm. so at that moment I felt somewhat relieved.

the next day we were looking for places to have a quick dinner before heading to the airport. as I was curious how this restaurant was able to deserve such a good review on Yelp, I proposed we try this place! we arrived exactly at 5:30, hoping to get in immediately when it opens. and guess what? there was already a very long waiting line in front of the restaurant! definitely a good sign! 

as soon as we were able to get into the restaurant, a waiter comes to us with a charming smile asking if we had a reservation or not. (so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the  owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!

it's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry  as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off! I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it doesn't fail to surprise me either!

btw, the waiter is very tentative and knows what dish to get!

well, enough has been said. this is a must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"All other thai food is inferior to this restaurant. 

Sizzling Duck Panang Curry. Just order it!

It's in the most unimpressive location. Small doors open to a palace of Thai deliciousness. 

Well worth the wait. I just need to bribe the hostess to always leave me a reserved table.

{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. The hype is real. They have spicy options that will melt your face, but you're welcome to get dishes that aren't nuclear if that's not your thing. Well worth the hassle of getting a table."}
{"text":"Amazing! The curry is delicious and the garlic shrimp and crispy duck. Due to the wait being 2 hours long we had to order it to go and ate in our car. I can't wait to go back and actually eat inside."}
{"text":"I am throughly impressed. It's my first time dining at a Thai restaurant in Vegas and I must say, this beats any SoCal and I mean 626 Thai restaurants. 

Food:
1) Crab Fried Rice: As mentioned by other reviewers, I have no preference for it. It was good, but nothing extraordinary. In fact, the rice is a bit mushy and salty. I would pass on this.

2) Crispy Roasted Duck Panang: After seeing 2873838 reviews about it, I was intrigued to try it. This is my first time choosing duck as a protein to pair up with curry. I got level 2 (\"mild\") spicy. This was also okay. The sauce was good, but I didn't care for the duck. Doesn't top pek King duck for sure.

3) Garlic Prawns: As expensive as it is ($27), it was pretty darn good. Please note, you'll get some empty shells but still tasty. Would reorder.

4) Chicken Satay (appetizer): Holy f*ck. This was DA BOMB . The peanut sauce.... Where do I even begin. It was the BEST, I mean, HANDS DOWN, FEETS DOWN, best sauce evaaaaaaa. I HIGHLY recommend to order. 

Service: The staff was okay. They don't look very pleased with their job. A little smile won't hurt. 

OVERALL: Would come back and will definitely order the chicken satay"}
{"text":"Lots of people told me I had to check this place out when I was in Vegas. Since I knew they had Northern Thai dishes that's the route I took. I had Khao Soi ( the best I've ever had) and a dish with pork and jack fruit that they recommended. I was not head over heals for the dish with the jack fruit ( you actually could barely tell there was jack fruit it blended in well, it just wasn't my favorite). If I could I'd give this place 4.5 stars ( it wasn't quite deserving of 5 in my mind). I was stuck in a little back room and felt a bit neglected. The server came around but I feel like I was forgotten about half the time. On the other hand I came with my luggage and they were very sweet and put it in their wine storage room ( they have a huge wine selection by the way). 
I'll be back next time I go to Vegas. Hopefully I won't be by myself so I can try more of the dishes. Also if anyone is wondering it was about a 12 dollar Uber from the middle of the strip."}

All I can say is that if you like Thai food... You must try Lotus of Siam-- you won't know good Thai food until you do!"}

We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and appetizers and poured over the menu. Before we knew it 40 minutes had passed and we were being seated. The food and service were both impeccable. I loved the impressive feel of the restaurant, like a hidden gem"}
{"text":"This is a must go to place! The food is great! But be sure to either make reservations or come early, there is always a wait! Compared to other Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, dishes here are very different and varieties of different parts of Thailand.

Must try-
Garlic prawns"}
{"text":"The Nam Kao Tod completely blew us away. Absolutely worth the Uber trip to this spooky strip mall. (Hint: if you have to wait for a table, go to the Cornish Pasty Co. very nearby for some great beers.)

Everything else was fantastic, especially the Crispy Garlic Prawns. The chef's specials and the northern Thai parts of the menus are the places to go for entrees.

So how amazing was the their famous Nam Kao Tod? So insanely good that we couldn't get it out of our heads, and went back three days later and each got an order of our own as an appetizer. Unforgettable."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the Memorial Day weekend. I was really feeling Thai. Took a look at Yelp and decided on this location, Lotus. When we arrived at 6:15pm there was a sign posted 2 hours wait time. No problem, put our name on the wait list and drove north. We were gone an hour before my husband got a text notifying us that our table was ready.  Took us 20 mins to get back. We were seated right away, but it took at least 30 mins before we received our food.  The food was delicious. Don't know if I'll be back if the wait is 2 hours in the future."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL! ITS ALL ABOUT THAT CRISPY DUCK in PANANG CURRY AKA KHAO SOI!! Forget the strip and come here to eat! I had the pad Thai, crispy garlic shrimp, issan sausage, drunken soft shell crab and let me tell you THE BEST MEAL I HAD IN VEGAS. First let me rave about the duck Panang curry( KHAO SOI) My mouth is watering just thinking about the crispy duck breast with the rich 6/10 spicy Panang curry. It's rich, creamy, and the spice just create a symphony in your mouth. The curry itself is just perfect alone and the duck makes it 100x better! I mean renowned chefs like Ming Tsai and Anthony Bourdain say it's perfection, then best believe it's perfection as its finest. Now let's continue with the crispy garlic shrimp. Its cooked properly, crispy on the outside, and sweet and juicy in the inside like how a perfect shrimp should be. Order the KHAO SOI and drizzle that sauce in the crispy shrimp with some rice that comes with the KHAO SOI and you will be in food heaven. Next is there handmade issan sausage, I wasn't really a fan of it. I found it a bit salty to my liking but it's one of the famous dishes to order. The drunken soft shell noodle was nothing that special as well as their pad Thai. Moving to dessert! I would love to mention how great their coconut ice cream is! I haven't found another place that captured the integrity of the coconut floral yet delicate flavor. Dessert is a must!!! YES THE PLACE IS OFF THE STRIP BUT DONT LET THAT BE THE REASON YOU DON'T GO! ITS THAT GREAT! ITS A MUST, KHAO SOI ftw!!!"}
{"text":"We got the jackfruit curry and the catfish curry. The jackfruit didn't have any flavor, but that may be due to the fruit being cooked with the curry too long. Br catfish curry was cooked well. We also got wontons and dumplings. Those were excellent."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the US.   Amazing dishes made with love!  Must try the crispy rice app and the short rib with noodles!"}
{"text":"oh, lotus of siam! how i want to love you!

they once made a very fantastic pad thai, which is no longer that fantastic. it came out literally as a lump of starch, made with rice noodles that were far too thin and far too cooked, and the sauce (which had this amazing sour bite to it last time) was so. freaking. generic.

and there was the panang beef. i know it's not the most famous thing on the menu, but what made me love them was their sauces and seasoning, and it was so very mediocre. 

we also ordered the gai lan with fried pork belly. there was probably only two stalks worth of thinly-sliced gai lan in the dish, and had the nerve to charge us $11.00 for the dish. 

i didn't have to drive to las vegas and waste my appetite for this - i could have been on my couch in my underwear and have it delivered for about half of what lotus of siam charged me.

i know you're famous, but you're famous because you were good! and now you are very not. go get your groove back, lotus of siam."}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S

My only complaint is that I can't get my roommate to share spicy dishes with me, otherwise excellent everything!"}

{"text":"I've been dying to visit and finally made it last weekend.  We were lucky to get the last seating of the night.  So you primarily come for the food and to see what all the Bourdain hype is about.

Prices are reasonable, and service is good."}
{"text":"The Commercial Center Mall is not the most obvious choice for Las Vegas' best Thai restaurant, but you will find it here nontheless.

Jonathan Gold of Gourmet magazine called Lotus of Siam the \"best Thai restaurant in North America.\"

I wouldn't go that far, but it is very good!"}
{"text":"Giving one star because no curry entree found on the lunch buffet.  I inquired and was told curry dish is available only on certain day.  How could a Thai buffet without curry chicken or curry beef."}
{"text":"Still a 5 star, although it is so much busier since the last time we were here. The food is superb. They have this restaurant down to a science. I would be surprised if any table stayed more than an hour at the rate that they are churning people out. I am surprised at the people outside waiting as the only way to go is to make a reservation, otherwise the wait will be 2 hours. Super great wine selection, although I wish they had a cocktail menu as well. Anything that you order will be great, don't listen to these Yelp reviews where it seems that they clearly didn't make a reservation and were sore. Crispy duck anything is my pick, I have had them all. The squid or papaya salad is a nice start. Tom Kha soup is avoidable; it doesn't taste any different than anywhere else. I would stick with the Northern Thai specialties or ask your server what they like. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"WOW... best thai food I've ever had, this place is probably what I'll miss most about Vegas when I home to OC. 

From the outside I assumed the restaurant would be a small hole in the wall but when you go inside, to the right of the small dining room is a large dining room (which makes this place a big hole in the wall I suppose) . The decor is minimal, the furniture was kinda old and basic.  

The food? AAAAAHHHHMAAAZEBALLS! Everything had SO much flavor. Since I came in a party of 3 we were not able to have much of a variety but we ordered 4 dishes. Crying tiger, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang and seafood padthai (off menu item). 

Everything was bomb.com but the duck curry stood out to me most. The meat was crispy & sauce was so flavorful. Fried garlic prawns was very garlicy and prawns tasted fresh.

Service was nice & friendly. Definitely coming here EVERYTIME I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is slightly over rated. The foods in general are OK. Portions are very small and a little bit pricey. Service was good though."}
{"text":"\"Yes, yes, and yes~\"

This was the reaction after dining at this place.  The hype is justified. Yes, I had to wait 1.5 hrs to dine here but sincerely, \"it's worth it.\"  There are no words to describe the quality of each and every dishes and all dishes were marvelous. Each bite tickled my pallet as they were inviting and satisfying.  The only disappoint I had with this place was when I had to leave this place.  DEFINITELY, MUST STOP THAI place in LV."}
{"text":"If you don't order the crispy rice salad, then don't bother eating here.  The relatively few poor reviews can probably be explained away by the simple fact that they missed the best things on the menu, and this one is the best of the best."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had and I live near San Francisco so have had some great Thai.  The atmosphere is very casual (which I actually like).  The menu and fine wine list are extensive.  I recommend the garlic shrimp and salad with steak.  We went back a second time the weekend of our visit.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Small space, a bit overprice but good is good. A lot of hype but if you are not a celebrity or they know you they service is okay."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at LOS once. I've heard so many people rave about this place! My coworker is thai mix and has told me their \"jackfruit (which is pounded) dish\" taste JUST LIKE HER MOMS dish! I did try it. I liked it even though I couldn't make out the taste. It is very hard to explain. Of course I just \"taste\" I need to get my own lol! I mean I'm not going to just take a whole scoop off her plate. I'll definitely be back! There's so many specialty dishes to try. I like how their menus are sectioned off to regions. Never been to a Thai restaurant like that. 

Originally , we went to LOS for their lunch buffet. My coworkers and I arrived there before it opened. People were already waiting! Once we sat down, it was just getting crowded. You could tell most of the patrons were on their lunch break. If I remembered correctly, it was $7.99? Well, I was less than $10 bucks. I thought that was a deal!"}
{"text":"I would fly to Las Vegas for the sole purpose of dining at Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Off the strip, but well worth the uber/taxi ride. They were able to accommodate our large group and food requests. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"Really great food! Tried several dishes and no complaints... Spicy chicken wings, crab fried rice, garlic fried prawns, crispy duck with curry, mango sticky rice, papaya salad, and more."}
{"text":"The more I come here the more I love this place!! I love the garlic spawns and the soft shell crab is delious! My must stop everytime I come to vegas!"}
{"text":"This establishment was highly recommended to me by a friend to try during my visit in Vegas. We were able to skip the long wait by making a reservation so make sure to do that! Unless you are willing to wait a hour. We were seated at a nice table in their second section and was promptly served by a waiter. This waiter was clearly busy was still coming at perfect times during our dine in experience. We got the garlic prawns and drunken noodles with crispy duck. The stuffed chicken was amazing though! Definitely recommended that! They were both delicious however a bit overpriced. Maybe if they up the furniture and the front door upon walking in with the waiting room I would be a bit more at ease paying for this $$$ restaurant. This being a hole in a wall clearly had potential for greatness. The owner was very kind and overall food and service was great. 4/5 due to  it being a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I heard this place was the best Thai in Vegas. My friends brag how it's amazing. I've seen pictures of the lines but when I went I think I was expecting too much. I ordered the wontons and the edges were burnt and the meat inside was dry. My friend ordered the \"best\" pad Thai which was ok. I ordered the duck in curry and it too was ok. Service was well... We got in and there was no one at the front desk. We waited awhile before someone acknowledge us. Our waiter took forever to just get our drink order and an eternity to get our food ordered. Perhaps lunch is not a good time to go. I'll give them another try and go for dinner."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY incredible food. Interesting sort of cafe environment in a not so great area in Las Vegas, but the authentic cuisine brings people from all over to this dumpy area of town. That must mean they think the food is very good. I obviously agree."}
{"text":"I heard about Lotus of Siam years ago from a friend but being stuck on the strip each and every time I visited Vegas I never had the chance to venture out.  Until this time.

Lotus of Siam is located in a strip mall away from all the action of the strip.  When you step in the door you are greeted by a narrow waiting area filled with newspaper write-ups over the years giving kudos to Lotus.  If you are a drinker your best bet is to wait for your table in the bar area as there will be a wait--weekends can run up to an hour or more.  The bar is beer and wine only.

There are tons of tables inside Lotus of Siam with bright hanging pendant light fixtures.  If you are looking for a dark atmosphere you won't find it here.  

Lotus of Siam has really great tasting Thai food plus an excellent selection of wine.  I had the drunken noodle crab.  It was good but a bit steep in cost at $19.  My friend had a beef dish that cost $18 that she felt was overpriced.  I feel like your best bet is to order from their basic Thai side of the expansive menu as those dishes are $10 or less and will be same portion size and just as tasty.

Tip for the restaurant:  the food is served in shallow dishes which means that it gets cold quickly.  Serving it in deeper plates would be a great improvement."}
{"text":"Purchased 2015 Toyota Camry today from Nino Quality Motors. I must say the service we received today was outstanding. Matthew Service Manager/ Sales was great! Getting the car financed was easy and hassle free. I left the dealership with my new car feeling great about the service I received and purchasing a new vehicle on my own."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars for this place.

So when I think of Thai food, I think of flavorful food.  However, this place didn't tickle my taste bud or even satisfy my Thai food craving.

Found this place on yelp and wanted to try this place since it has 4-stars and over 1200 reviews.  I thought to myself...wow this place must be authentic and good.

Got there at about 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm for dinner) after reading some reviews saying that this place has a long wait and I didn't want to wait in line.  There were a few people waiting in line already and more people came after we got in line.  

The place is fairly big and has a pretty impressive wine cellar... but sorry to say that was the one thing that was impressive.  They also had a big staff if waiters/waitress waiting to serve you.  We got seated and the place filled up pretty quickly.

So when you walk into an Asian restaurant and see that 90% of the customers there were American...what would you think?  Not trying to offend anyone, but I think this place is catered to the American's taste buds.

Food we tried:

Thai Ice Tea - Pretty good smooth tea but it was a little on the sweeter side.  

Spicy Chicken Wings - I think this should be called sweet and sour chicken wings instead.  This dish was okay and was very saucy and sweet...not spicy at all (it looks like it has sweet and sour sauce on it).

Nau Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky) - As you can say... beef jerky...its pretty tough and not as flavorful...

Som Thum (Papaya Salad) - Very toned down.  I mean very very toned down and bland.  They papaya was coarsely cut and is not the thinly strands as you see in other papaya salad.  Not authentic at all.

Crispy Duck Panang Curry - This is probably the best food dish of all that we ordered.  Still not as tasty as the ones I've had back in NorCal. Again, this dish is also tone down.

Sea Bass Drunken Noodles - How can you go wrong with a noodle dish??? but somehow they manage to make it bad.  The taste of it was bland and the noodles were hard.  I guess the noodles are probably old.  The sea bass was deep fried and was decent in taste. 

Mango Sticky Rice Dessert - I would say this is the best tasting dish of our meal.  Come on.. how can you go wrong with mango and sticky rice right.  I love mangoes so this dish is definitely yummy to me.

I would have to say we did over order for the two of us, but because of the reviews I read, I wanted to try different items.  The portions are smaller than other Thai restaurants and the prices are a bit marked up.  With all the dishes we ordered, we thought our check will come out to about $70, but I was wrong...our bill was almost $100.  We could of gone somewhere else and have better tasting food with the amount we paid.  Pretty disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"What an amazing find but MAKE RESERVATIONS!  

One review I read somewhere said this was the best Thai food in North America. I've had some excellent Thai food in Chicago and this place was easily one of the top five I have had. Wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas and it was a real treat. We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.

We decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being \"almost sweet\". It wasn't but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.

We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table. Call ahead an make reservations. It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant. If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed. Why only 4 stars? Well, it isn't actually the best I've ever had but it is very, very good. There were a few things that didn't quite wow me but on balance a great meal that capped off a great vacation."}
{"text":"I have never had Thai before so when my team decided to get it I said can't hurt. We ordered early and it was ready promptly. The people aimed to please and were efficient. They also stuck to our time boundaries so they didn't lose a customer!
We had pad thai, drunken noodles, chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and a spicy beef salad. Now I don't like pasta/noodles but the pad Thai was great with chicken. Nice flavor but barely any chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was good but barely any chicken there as well. What we did have was a nice balance and it was nice that the chicken wasn't fried. The curry varied depending on who you asked and the drunken noodles were good just had to use fork and knife to cut a piece as one big cluster. 
What Food I had, I  liked the flavor to, just need more balance of components. I don't know if would go back though as not big on rice and noodles and most dishes had one or other. I learned Thai isn't the healthiest as felt greasy after eating it too. Oh and we all agreed, didn't feel full during but after we all did!"}
{"text":"First - make a reservation and don't be late. They only hold your table for 5 minutes and there is definitely someone already waiting outside for it.

Second - flip to the Northern Thai section of the menu book and you will not go wrong. Try the khao soi, nam prik ong (red chili dip), and roasted duck curry #131 (trust me, pineapple and grapes can go together!). Yeah, you could get pad thai (and it's phenomenal here), but branch out and get something new. 

Third - they are not kidding with the spicy level. If you overestimate, get the mango sticky rice with coconut ice cream to cool the burn and tummy regrets."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. 1 hour wait after we ordered and the manager never even came up to apologize. Opposite of my first experience here but this type of service is definitely memorable for all the wrong reasons. 

Crap visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! One of our Vegas favorites for sure!! The Restaurant is very close to the strip as well."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 

We were looking forward to an amazing meal but didn't have a single dish that deserved more than two stars. 

Tom Yum soup had too much tamarind flavor. 
Roast duck curry was too watery and had grapes in it which was a surprising first if only it tasted good. 
Thai sausage was cold and lacked flavor. 
Papaya salad had really thick strands of papaya that didn't soak up enough flavor. 
Drunken noodle with soft shell crab was bland and the noodles all stuck together. 

They forgot our sticky rice then charged us for it, which bumped this review down to one star. 

Take a cab somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews we had very high expectations and made reservations three days prior to our Thanksgiving arrival in Las Vegas. 

Now for the truth -- the place did not live up to our expectations. 

First of all the location is not great -- I'll give it a \"D.\" It is in a run down kind of trashy shopping center with several next-door stores with windows boarded up. The restaurant itself is not all that attractive with plain walls, old kind of tacky  pictures on the white wash walls but -- understandably because the food reviews are so good -- the place is very crowded and noisy with zippo privacy. Probably not the best place to impress a date. I'll give restaurant appearance and ambience a \"C-.\"

Service was not any better for us than your average busy Chinese restaurant.  We had to work to get our waiters attention. He wasn't all that friendly, was not dressed as you would expect a waiter serving in such a famous place and he got our orders wrong. Worse yet all our food was brought out at one time appetizers, soup and main dishes so we could not savor any one of them which further detracted from the experience. 

Now for the food:
The crispy duck with panang curry was wonderful crisp skin flavorful sauce tender meat. \"A.\"

The crispy duck with Thai basal was equally outstanding. \"A.\"

The garlic fried prawns with seperately fried shells  were crispy light not oily but a little dry perhaps overcooked. It came out lukewarm. Garlic flavor was not in any way special and price was kind of steep. I actually would prefer a high end Japanese restaurant shrimp tempura. The dish tasted better when we put a little panang curry from the duck dish onto it. \"B.\"

Tom yum chicken soup ok nothing special in the flavor or prep compared to any other descent Thai restaurant. \"B.\"

Green Papaya salad with fish sauce. I hate to say this but I have this classic dish at nearly every Thai restaurant I go to and this one was quite mediocre. the texture suffered from shredding that was too coarse. The papaya was either too old or pre-shredded some time in advance which made it soggy and unacceptable. The texture also suffered from having too much sauce drowning the papaya and the flavor was not different enough from any other Thai restaurant to recommend this dish. \"C.\"

The chicken Satay was one of the dishes recommended on the Internet and it came out tender with a nice peanut sauce which was  good but not any better than any other decent Thai restaurant. \"B.\"

Chilean sea bass over drunken noodles with basal was very good perfectly cooked with lively flavors The only negative was the noodles were a little soggy and the size of the dish was kind of small relative to the price. \"A-.\"

Jackfruit relish salad with carrots cucumbers lettuce was not particularly exciting in flavor texture or presentation. I won't grade it because I cannot compare it to anything else similar I will only state that it was not  good enough  for us to order again. 

Sticky rice with mango was good but not extraordinary. I'll give it a \"B.\"

Will I come back? Probably not because the location service and ambience are below average price is quite high and food --at least the dishes we had were mediocre to good only. I will say that this place had a very large wine list but I would not want to shell out a lot of money for expensive libation for an ambience and service and food quality which was just mediocre at best."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at Cafe Siena at 5:55 pm.  2 gentlemen arrived and were seated across from us about 5 minutes later.  Their waiter took their order immediately while we were still waiting for our waitress to come and take our order.  The 2 gentlemen received their meals and we are still waiting.  FINALLY received our meal at 6:40 pm.  It was on a Tuesday and there was not a lot of patrons there.  The staff offered us free desert for our inconvenience; we declined.  The Manager, Romina, came over and offered her apologies.  We are NOT happy with the service.  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING and WILL TELL EVERYONE WE KNOW NOT TO EAT THERE!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I have EVER had. No place like this. The DUCK is awesome. If you go there, you will not regret it. The wall made of the wine rack is my favourite . Try the khao soi ( phonetically that how its spelled actual i don't know), duck in Panang curry, Nam Kao and to finish it off, have the mango sticky rice !! Loooooove it. I would suggest making a reservation before hand, because they are always full for dinner and lunch on weekends too."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the old location a number of times and they never disappoint! I love their food! I've eaten many different things here, but my favorite has to be their Garlic Prawns! The flavor and the texture are like no other. I remember there was one prawn left and I was so full, but I told my friend that he could have the prawn, but I wanted the shell. It really is crispy like a chip! I like the old location better since it was tucked away in a nondescript mini-mall. Even though many people knew about it, it still seemed like a local secret. Now it's closer to the strip, and around other popular restaurants. Probably better for them to be more visible, but it loses some of the charm. You always needed to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance. It seems harder to get a table now. I highly recommend this restaurant for any Thai food lover."}
{"text":"Someone told me about this place, I love Thai food, and I had to try it, the food is great, they flavors are on point, the service is excellent, there's plenty of parking space and the outside of the restaurant doesn't do no justice to the inside of the place, if you enjoy Thai food, this is the place to come and visit, you won't regret it! 
 I'll be coming again, next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Incredible hole-in-the-wall Thai place! Went with 5 other friends and split ten dishes all family style - all delicious. Definitely recommend the Khao Soi Braised Short Rib, the spicy chicken wings, and the garlic prawns"}
{"text":"My second time here. We ordered the basil and chili with sliced beef, spicy number 7, pad Thai with chicken, spicy level number 7, and musaman curry with chicken, spicy level 5. It is worth noting that the basil and chilli with sliced beef is exceptional. Reminds me of this wonderful restaurant called Tara Thai in Manhattan Beach, CA, when it was still owned and by Penn, who also was the cook. 

We arrived for lunch on a Friday at 1:30. Many of the tables were occupied, and because it is the number 1 rated restaurant in Las Vegas according to Yelp and Trip Advisor, I was happy to get a table right away. The server took the order after about 10 minutes which was fine since we were talking anyway. The portions are downright dainty. The pad Thai was burnt, and when we requested another plate that wasn't burnt, it was almost the same. 

Bottom line is that the pad Thai was downright awful, and the musaman curry was nothing exceptional. I felt incredibly full after sharing these 3 small entrees with someone. Shortly after leaving I felt incredibly bloated, achy, and like I took laughing gas. Called the restaurant to ask if they used MSG and they said they put it in every dish! 2 hours later my muscles ache, I feel sick and this top rated restaurant pretty much msg poisoned me. 

Bottom line, you can get better Thai food at Krung Thai on Flamingo and Decatur, which doesn't use msg and is about half the price. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"The wait can be long, it's expensive, it's in a ghetto strip mall with crackhead homeless people asking to wash your windows, and they don't have anything dishes for kids, but it's the best thai food I've ever had, the menu is huge, and the crispy duck curry is amazing. Therefore it gets a 5 despite all the negatives. I wish it were in California and not Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't worry about curb appeal, just get inside this place.  It is fantastic  Some of the best Thai food I have ever had and I may go as far to say it was the BEST Thai food I have ever had...

We waited to get in but they have a great system that you can check from your phone to see how long you have waited and where you are in line!  Everything we ordered was delicious. Dumplings.  Delicious.  Panang.  Delicious.  

Don't get caught up with the strip.  Take a taxi, drive, walk, just get there."}
{"text":"Great place to eat off the strip. Lunch buffet is now $9.99, though I order the drunken noodles with soft shelled crab ($18) even at lunch. Everything is done well and when you want something spicy... you can get spicy!"}
{"text":"An oasis of real food amongst the buffet lines and crap overpriced food on the strip.  Everything we had was delicious, but the pounded young jackfruit was a standout.  Located in a dive strip mall off the strip, but worth the cab ride.  The Northern Larb is also great, much more flavorful than the generic larb in your average thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, this place!! In town for my cousins bachelorette Party and she HAD to come here. We got some stares...but that was ok! The couple at the bar with us actually had just gotten married and she as well had her bachelorette party there. What are the odds?! Anyway.... I'm still full from their amazing Kai Koowah! No, I'm not a huge Thai food buff so I didn't know exactly what to expect but it sounded amazing and my cousin said if it sounds amazing, then it is. And she didn't fail me! The table ordered two bottles of the Ponzo pino Gris along with the papaya salad, egg rolls and beef salad to split. That was all quite yummy as well! More than half of the table ordered the Kao Soi from the \"Northern Menu\" and o had a little FOMO. My cousin said it was her favorite thing ever! The dessert we all shared was incredible too- mango sticky rice with coconut ice cream. Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food we have ever eaten!
The sausage itself, encompasses all the flavors of this magnificent country."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure that did not disappoint. It was definitely the best Thai food I've had in a long time. 

My friend and I started off the meal with Tom Yum soup and we asked for a level 4 spicyness and OH BOY it was SPICY! So definitely order lower than you what you think your spicyness level it because oh man, my throat was on fire but I love every single bite. 

Then we ordered the Thai BBQ chicken and the classic Pad Thai. and OH MAN! The chicken had so much flavor and it was cooked to perfection. They used small noodles to make the pad thai which I had never seen before, but it didn't matter because the flavors were perfect. I ate until I was close to exploding. 

And like other yelpers mentioned, the outside does look a little sketchy, but the inside is nice and clean and very spacious. DEFINITELY come eat here! I highly recommend it. This might be my new favorite thai joint."}
{"text":"I have tried many different Thai places and yet this place it on top three. Sad that it's not local. Have to stop by next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Review of Buffet:

UGH!  It was very very underwhelming. 

Maybe regular menu is great, but do not get the buffet IMHO.  About half the restaurant was eating the buffet... unfortunately I was in the idiot half of the crowd."}
{"text":"Service: 4 stars
Setting: 3.5 stars (after remodel recently)
Food:  5 stars is NOT enough
Value: 5 stars

I live with 3 Thai restaurants within 3 blocks of my loft, highly rated.  I've now been RUINED... RUINED I say... to other Thai restaurants.

BTW, If you drove by this place without knowing about it,  I guarantee you would keep driving.

But it is simply one of the best Thai restaurants in the world.

My party of 6 dined like kings and queens on course after course... and had a $90 bill at the end of the night.

I couldn't pronounce or spell the dishes, so I won't embarrass myself by trying.  Read the reviews at the entrance, on the wall, while you wait, and then order those dishes.  You will NOT be disappointed.

Best thing we had was some crispy rice appetizer, which blew our minds.  If you see anything that resembles that, order it.

I go to Vegas maybe once a year.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I will eat at LEAST two dinners there per 1 week stay, for years and years to come, at Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"What's wrong with getting the flu in a James Beard rated restaurant? Ruining the meal for the table sitting next to you. Guys, I am so sorry. Let this be a lesson to ALWAYS GET YOUR FLU SHOT. I've been here many times and the food is awesome. Though nothing compares to the level of service of the nicest hostess tending to you when you suddenly develop symptoms in the middle of the dining room. I am so sorry. Lotus of Siam remains, in my opinion, the best Thai in the country."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Every good thing I have been told about this place is true.  Try the panang curry and the pad Thai."}
{"text":"Located in an unassuming strip mall, people come from all over to eat here...and for good reason. The food is pretty amazing. The garlic prawns are awesome! Make sure to eat every part of the shrimp, shell and all. The shell is crispy like a chip and has tons of flavor. There was one shrimp left, with the shell mostly separated from the meat. I told my friend to take the meat and I ate the shell. When you prefer the shell to the meat, it must be good. The crispy duck over noodles was cooked perfectly. The pad see ew was one of the best I've had, and the mango & sticky rice was the best way to top off the meal. If you have the chance to venture away from the strip a little, come here. They are famous for their northern Thai cuisine so make sure to order a couple of dishes from the back of the menu. Make sure to make reservations. There is a steady stream of people coming in and gets crowded fast. I got there at 7pm on a Sunday, and the place was still crowded when I left after 9pm."}
{"text":"The price is fair and the food was delicious! 

The place gets packed at night even if it's in a really segregated plaza. I suggest you get there early just to get your order in earlier! 

There was quite a huge break from the appetizer and the main dishes. That would be my only complaint. I'm guessing they are short on staff or just can't produce as fast as we all order. 

I am really picky with my Thai food because I don't like the Americanized versions. So, for me to give it a five stars mean it's well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Thai. Ever. They have over 130 menu items to choose from. The cocktails are also tasty. \"Pain Eraser\" is a smooth creamy coconut-milk flavored cocktail that helps soothe and offset the spicy nature of many Thai dishes. The soups are succulent, but spicy enough to make your nose run."}
{"text":"What can I possibly say about one of the most memorable meals I have ever had. This place is in the top three of best restaurant meals that I have ever had. We started with crispy rice that was so well balanced I am almost afraid to go home and cook again because I know I will never get to this kind of balanced flavor in any meal. For dinner we shared pad thai, short rib panang curry, and crispy garlic prawns. Everything that we had was better than the last. On a whim before we left we ordered some sticky rice that made the meal even better when I really thought that was not possible. I have dined at joel rubichon, Estatiario Milos, Nobu, and the list goes on of Vegas spots you cannot miss that I have not missed. This one topped them all, and for a bill of under 100 for three including drinks and dessert. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"You've got to stray from the strip for this one, but it is definitely worth it. On Sundays they open at 5:30. Our group of 12 arrived at 5pm to see many people already lining up! There is one line for reservations, which they will let in first, and 1 line for people without. Don't let the shabby strip mall fool you, this Northern Thai restaurant is worth heading out to. You can tell that it is where the locals go.

The food came out hot and fast. We ordered A LOT. For many dishes you can choose your numbered spice level, so we often ordered a few of the same dishes at different levels. My favorite dish was the Garlic Prawns. These were full of garlic flavor, large and crunchy from being fried. Many in the group enjoyed the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry. The duck is served on top, and you mix it all into the curry. Crying Tiger Beef was another favorite of mine. While it was one of the more simple dishes, the thin beef was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and the jus on the side completed the dish. 

For dessert, I loved the Coconut Ice Cream. They make it with real coconut. It was so light and icy, almost a sorbet texture, while being full of coconut flavor. A great find and a great meal overall."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a year, and every year, Lotus of Siam keeps getting better, as does their wine list . . . the food is truly exceptional, and the wine list is one of the best in the country, PERIOD, and easily the finest in any Asian restaurant I have ever seen.

The \"Greatest Restaurant in the World's Worst Strip Mall\" Award continues to go to LoS!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a long time. Go for the garlic prawns and crispy fried duck with panang curry. It's not the cheapest items on the dish, but they are well worth the money."}
{"text":"In planning our trip to Vegas we knew that, since we are not big clubbers, we were looking to do shows and other fun things in the evenings. We booked two shows and went looking on the internet to find something \"different\". When we came upon the Lip Smacking Foodie Tour we knew that it was for us. My wife and I both like to cook and we have visited most of the upper-tier restaurants in and around Chicago. We signed up for the evening strip tour with drinks. We hesitated when we saw the price but we said, what the heck, it seems overpriced but let's do it anyway.

We met our guides Abra and Donald, and the four other tour participants in front of the Aria at 6PM. For the next four hours we were treated to gracious hosts, reserved seating, luscious food and delicious drinks. An easy cop-out for the tour would to be to go the well known chef driven restaurants, the Guy Fieri's, the Wolfgang Puck's, etc... What we did instead was to go to the lesser know chef driven restaurants where the food is really delivered with commitment and passion. At each stop we were given three, and sometimes four, of the chefs signature dishes. I could not tell you which stop was my favorite as they were all great. We were always very heartily welcomed at the restaurants. The staff, and sometimes the chef him/her self, would come out to explain the dishes and to thank us for coming. Be ready for somewhat adventurous eating. If meatloaf and mashed potatoes is your idea of a great meal out then this is probably not for you. And the drinks, they were always plentiful and delicious. They were also sure to complimented the food being served. Surprisingly, one was very elaborate, involving fire and alcohol vapor sipped from a beaker. Not only did the tour provide us with great food and drink, along the route we were treated to a behind the scenes tour and tasting of how chocolate was made and a very interesting stop at a unique shop that we had walked by several time without really noticing. Very cool! Don and Abra also pointed out several art installations that we had missed before. Nothing like a little culture with your movable feast.

The following day, when we showed the concierge at our hotel the prior evening's itinerary she was very impressed. She said that these were some of here favorite restaurants and that they were definitely \"under the radar\" for most tourists.  She said that she plans now to take the tour herself.

So, all in all it was a great experience. The food and drink was fantastic. The hosts did a great job and the walking part of the tour was interesting and enlightening. As far as the cost of the tour in concerned, we now feel that it is a drop dead bargain. If the experience sounds good to you, do not let the price deter you. I think that you will find that it is well worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I have been. It is in a very nondescript building, but awesome food. Everytime I am in Vegas I eat here. Last time I was here, I forgot to make a reservation, so just did takeout... food was quick and just as awesome."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had but it almost didn't happen. I was a little leery when we drove up and there was 16 feet of plywood over the front window. But once we stepped in, it was a whole different story. 

Food was great. Complex flavors. Service was great. The only thing I wish is that I could have had was another trip back to eat."}
{"text":"Food was excellent here - and attentive personal service! Garlic prawns, crispy duck - and must have the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. Super wine list."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place!! The food is fantastic, great menu items. We usually come for a special occasion because it's a tad bit far for us. We recommend all of our friends when coming from out of town to try it."}
{"text":"Went there based on Yelp reviews
Ambiance is ok h
Location is a strip mall
Prices are high
We had
Veg egg rolls - solid 3.5/5
Garlic pepper sauce with shrimp -2.5.  
Drunken noodles with Sea Bass - 3/5
Noodles were very sticky almost glued together
Papaya salad - 4/5
For the price not worth it
Noodle wave in Dallas and Sala Thai in Fremont CA are way better and cheaper
Not worth a visit in my view"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner on jan 1st to start the new year off with a bang! Being use to amazing Thai in LA, I have big expectations for this type of restraunt.

We ordered  9 plates with 9 drinks, the total was around 230$ but the size of the plates were small and the flavor was just decent. Everyone had to ask for drink refills every time, but the waiter was nice, but not very attentive...

Overall our experience was just ok, I read all these raving review but I do not agree with them. I'm definitely going to find another Thai spot before I come back here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm only giving Lotus of Siam 5 stars because I can't give it 6 stars. Best Thai food I have ever had! 

Most Thai restaurants have really similar menu's but Lotus of Siam has unique, elevated dishes that put it above all the competition. 
Dishes that were best:

Drunken noodles with soft shell crab 
Crispy duck with panang curry


Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very special place. Best authentic thai food in Las Vegas. Its not in the best location
Maryland/sahara but the food is amazing. Large menu choice, fresh ingredients and always busy. There is even a taxi line that many tourist go to this place. Its that famous. Love their soups and fish dishes. Great Vegetarian dishes too."}
{"text":"New location, still best thai food in town. Love the new space. Very elegant and so much more room compared to the previous location. But it's not the atmosphere that keeps me coming back ... it's the damn good AUTHENTIC dishes. Haven't tried anything I didn't love. Some fave dishes however is the panang duck curry, crispy shrimp, tom ka soup, and of course the phad thai ... a must try. Happy with the new spot!"}
{"text":"This truly is a hidden treasure!!!  We are so glad that Yelp helped us discover it.  The place looks sketchy from the outside, but once you walk in the aromas are tantalizing.  We really enjoyed our crispy duck and catfish entrees, which were recommended by our great server.  The service was impeccable.  We look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food you'll ever find in Vegas.  A lot of nice restaurants in Vegas are overhyped and overpriced.  While the quality of food at this restaurant may not compare to the new fads of cuisine, it certainly lives up the the standards of Americans and Thais alike.  It tastes great and it's affordable.

Skip the casino food and come here instead."}
{"text":"Very good thai food but the portions were rather small.  That aside, probably one of the best pad thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Multiple choices but soooo yummy. Tom Kha soup and Prawns in a blanket for appetizers and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food you'll ever have in the country!!!! Pineapple fried rice, garlic prawns, etc etc etc"}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to going here after all the talk, press and reviews and it did not disappoint. My parents (who have never eaten Thai and are quite picky) even loved it and said it was their best meal in Vegas. All of our dishes were great, Thai spaghetti, pad see ew, papaya salad, sweet and sour chicken, and one more I forget, were all great! Service is also impeccable! Try to get off the strip and make it to this awesome hole in the wall if you are visiting (I almost don't want to share that because I don't want the wait to become crazy.)"}
{"text":"Read reviews. Saw on TV. Recommended by friends and Anthony Bourdain. Yep, it's the place to go in Vegas. Off the beaten path in an old strip mall. We researched the menu and  told to do Northern Thai. Told the waiter and he sent one of the owner's sons over. We said sausage, duck and prawns, medium hot and he ran with it. Brightly lit, one wall is a huge wine case. Take your pick. Not ++expensive, kids were eating with grandpas. It is a happy place and you will be too. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"The portions of food are really large, curry taste very well, but the meat taste a little bit dry, and not very tasty when eat inside of meat. Pork has some fat which I don't really like, and some ducks aren't very crispy. I noticed this restaurant won the best of city in 2006,2007, but I feel not very satisfying considering the fame of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic. Service tonight was a little spotty, but we arrived just when they opened for dinner to find a line waiting. Tried to make a reservation by calling them, but after several attempts that the phone was not answered we decided to just show up.

Still completely recommend Lotus. Have been going here for ten years and have never been disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food of my life. There is a place in NYC near Woodside in Queens that also serves great Thai. What makes this better is the two pages of Northern dishes and the salads. Perfect spicy, sweet, salty, sour dressing on all if them."}
{"text":"Best meal we had during our stay in Vegas. Also one of the most affordable. We each had an entree and a beer and it was our cheapest and most delicious meal we had during our stay in Sin City. Don't let the hidden location in a rundown strip mall deter you from visiting. They open for dinner at 5 pm each day. When we arrived on a Saturday late afternoon/evening, without reservations at 4:35, there was already a line of non-reservation folks 25 deep! Despite the line, we were seated shortly after the doors opened because the dining area is so large. You'd be seated quicker if you had a reservation, but it's not imperative if you're there early. 

Hubby enjoyed the \"best Pad Thai\" he's ever had! I also thoroughly enjoyed my Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (traditionally served with Chicken and Shrimp). We did have to ask for chop sticks and soy sauce as it wasn't provided on the table.

If we're ever back in Vegas, Lotus of Siam will be our first stop!"}
{"text":"I could not stop saying how great the food was while wee were eating. Fresh ingredients and amazing flavor. Was just voted best Thai food in the world by  a thai food critic for the Wynn. Amazinggggggg"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall Thai restaurant became really big. Why? You need to go and taste for yourself. The best in the country. Portions are small for some but absolute best."}
{"text":"OK, reading the other reviews here, i will not be very original! This is a great Thai restaurant and the best I had in Vegas so far! The place is in a remote beaten down section of Las Vegas, not very far from the convention center. I came here with friends at the end of the \"National Association of Broadcasters\" convention and the place was packed! My friends made a reservation and were there before so I did not have to wait but I saw people waiting in line for up to an hour while we were there.

The place itself is plain in terms of setting and the service is efficient but basic... but you forget about all this when eating the food and enjoying the company of good friends!"}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST chicken pad thai I've ever had. The noodles were dry. The three pieces of chicken that were in it were dry. It was not spicy. It was simply not good. I thought that with all the amazing reviews that people posted it would at least be edible, but alas, the reviewers have disappointed me again. This is not what pad thai is supposed to taste like. If I never return to this subpar Thai restaurant again, it will be too soon. I wish I could get a refund for this, because I couldn't even eat half of it. I'm sorely disappointed. And thanks to Yelp reviewers, I won't be trusting their opinions again. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I have to been to. 

Didn't expect the food here to be this amazing. It's located in a run down lot a little outside of the strip. Once you get inside the restaurant you see all tons of wine's behind a glass. A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean. 

The food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns. If you visit Vegas make sure to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed.

Recommendation: Sea Bass Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, and Green Curry"}
{"text":"Great discovery after watching food network on TV last weekend! As local had to watch TV to discover this Thai Gem in town :/ thank you dear Anthony Bourdain
I usually don't hang out on the East side of town.
Authentic Thai ( I am French Laotian and our culinary dishes are very similar)
We came on a Friday night at 6:30pm table for 3 - 1h15 mns wait: Worth it!
The entrance was crowded and the bar area busy busy. Fortunately we got a couch :) 
I had 1h to look at the staff running around ... seriously they are running. Tips if you are pretty and have a nice décolleté I guess sit at the bar, the manager will take care of you and only focus on you!
(sad what about all other waiting for their drinks lol, Sir work as hard as the waiters or even harder because you should show the example - that was the 1 star I kept away from the 5 stars this place  earns for the food)

Back to the amazing dishes we ordered and they served us.
At the bar we ordered 3 drinks, took them 25mns... while waiting and witnessing the scene I commented above I was like What the Hell?
Food is delicious, tasty and the flavor amazing. 

We started with a beef salad lime dressing spicy level 5, chicken wing level 5 as well
Gosh so so delicious!
I wish the portion were larger. If you don't eat spicy... say zero because we had a heat sweat while eating our appetizers LOL and we like spicy...
Ask for steamed rice it will help with the spicy...
The beef was tender, the lime dressing very refreshing. The wings were Crispy to perfection and the dressing YUMMY the sweet and spicy taste combination perfect!
Nick was our waiter and he was on top of the game. Very knowledgeable about the menu and would refill our iced tea or water before we even ask.

Koh Soi (egg noodle coconut milk curry), squid garlic, pad see ew, spicy fried rice sea food combination were our entrees.
Squid/calamari were soft and fresh (not chewy like in some place)

We finished with some sweet rice mango coconut, to cool down the heat :)
Portions are small so we didn't feel \"I over ate\".
Good service, would be nice to see more smile on staff face (they truly work hard).
Price are decent for such a fresh yummy authentic food. I will just say that their cocktail are overpriced $16 for a cocktail...
Suggest you to book ahead but 1h went by fast actually. If you dine around 8pm or later looks like the wait time is more reasonable.
Found my second favorite THAI place beside ARCHIS Thai bistro on rainbow and 215"}
{"text":"Is it Lotus of Shame? 

I have been going to this place for over 10 years. I used to love it. Food was tasty and unique - and the service was great (tho, I hadn't been there for the last 2 years or so). 

Recently, my local friends stopped going to this restaurant, saying Le Thai in downtown was better - also, heard that two of my friends got food poisoning eating shrimp here. Well, I didnt take their words and went back with my clients who were staying here for a convention. 

However,,

1. Service quality has dropped to the bottom line. 

Waitress were fine. But the real problem was these young waiters.

(after writing what happened here, I was disgusted - I needed to erase all that. I need to forget. That was how they behaved bad...)

2. Food quality didn't meet 5 stars,,, maybe 3.5. Used to be 5, tho.

You know, it is a bad example of a restaurant that goes bad when it become super popular. When you get tons of people, you have to cook fast and easy - waiters might forget about service - but then where is the quality that Lotus of Siam used to have? 

Don't get fooled by Yelp ratings. Trust your taste, because they treat you like a tourist who never go back and drop $$ anymore. Vegas quality. 

No, I will never go back. As a local, I rather wanna go to Le Thai and Weera Thai.

Oh and yes, they were talking bad shit about me when I told all the things above. Rude. Very rude. I could rate as no star or one star for this, but I am a nice guy, haha."}
{"text":"The woman who owns this establishment is so friendly and the food is phenomenal.  The wait for seating may be long but will be worth it.

Northern cuisine is the specialty served here. It is different than what most are used to from their experiences at other Thai restaurants. Of course it is offered and is delectably prepared, but if you order Pad Thai, Fried Rice, or any of the standard fare here, you wasted a trip and deprived yourself of experiencing what Lotus' specialty is and ate what you could have had at any number of strip mall joints. 

Splurge for anything w/ Crispy Duck."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a few days and this place came highly recommended. We got there right around 1pm on a Monday - today and it was busy. We had to wait about 35 minutes for a table of 2. We were told by the waitress that the buffet was closing in 25 minutes so we could order that or order off the menu. We chose to order off the menu.

We ordered an appetizer and two items off the Chefs Choice.
For drinks we got a Thai beer - Singha and then a Thai Iced team - which tasted like candy.


Our appetizer was  GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - the wings were big and fried perfectly well. The garlic was definitely in full force but really yummy.

Entrees included: GARLIC PRAWNS - which were really fantastic. Cooked perfectly and seasoned very nicely. The prawns came on top a small bed of lettuce, carrots, cilantro and a delicious sauce. This would be a great appetizer even for the table if you had a party of 4.

and

KHAO SOI BRAISED SHORT RIB - this was really great. the short rib was incredibly tender. The curry was just the right amount of spicy. 

Service was a little slow. It seemed like they had just gotten slammed and we were coming in right at the end of lunch rush. It took a while to get our food and it took a while for them to take the food away, get our bill and then for them to take  and run the credit card so we could leave.  I felt like they were rushed and so some customer service steps were definitely skipped. like checking back on us after we got our appetizer so we could order our drinks. I had to ask the food runner for drinks when he dropped off the entrees because the waiter never popped by to check on us. Not a huge deal - but when we placed our initial order we told the waiter we were debating on our drinks and asked to keep the menu so I was pretty sure he was looped into knowing we wanted to order drinks.

Food was pretty killer and I would highly recommend it. My hope is next time we come with more people so I can try many more things and I want to thank my hubby for eating a curry dish when hes not the biggest fan :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid Thai place. The service is OK but the menu and the food easily make up for it. Lotus of Siam has the biggest Thai menu i have ever seen and great descriptions of each dish for those who aren't Thai experts. Overall I really enjoyed the food (Panang Curry and Hot and Sour Veggie Soup) and recommend for anyone looking for great Thai"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Didn't know much about northern Thai food aside from what I saw on the Action Bronson and Viceland coverage of this place. Does not disappoint with all the celebrity hype. Crispy duck is amazing. Thai tea is really sweet. Really good meal."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Love the food & service is great."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite.  I've been eating it for years, been to 100's of places all over the map (even been to Thailand twice). Lotus of Siam is the best Thai I've ever eaten.  Every time I go to Vegas that is my first stop, I always order extra and eat that for breakfast the next day.  Try to avoid lunch and dinner rush, you will have to wait quite a while for a seat."}
{"text":"Last time we were in the Vegas area we tried Lotus of Siam. We had heard rave reviews and knew celebrities even frequented the place. When we first pulled up, we were a little surprised by the restaurant's appearance. It's definitely not fancy, and isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro. I just wish I could have it more often! Especially for the quality of the food, the prices are incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend Lotus of Siam... just be prepared to make reservations or endure a bit of a wait!"}
{"text":"The first few times I went to Vegas years ago, my friend kept saying that we needed to eat here because it had amazing Thai food despite it being middle of a sketchy part of town. So, we'd wake up in the morning, and call ahead to get a reservation, and find out that they didn't take reservations, and it'd be like 2 hours before we get a table. So, we never went there.

Eventually I made it out there, and my friend was right. Crazy good Thai food at reasonable prices, and it is in a highly sketchy part of town.

Fast forward a few years, and now whoever I happen to be eating with, no matter how hardy a Vegas vet they are, is always willing to consider Lotus as a food suggestion. I've tried probably a good third of their menu, and pretty much everything is great.

(As for the \"no reservations\" thing...they don't take reservations FOR LUNCH. You can totally get reservations for dinner.)

If you're coming here, I'd recommend starting with the Prawns in a Blanket. Expertly unshelled shrimp wrapped in bacon, and that is then wrapped in crispy wonton skin and fried to perfection. Served with a sweet dipping sauce.

The crab fried rice is great, and pretty much every curry that you order will complement this.

All of the curries are terrific, and while everything may seem a little on the small side, the combination of the curry sauce and the rice is generally enough to keep me well satisfied. 

Generally, you'll end up dropping about $20-$25 per person here, and have yourself a pretty good meal. I consider this a definite go-to, though I recommend trying to get out there on a weekday rather than a weekend. You'll find the waits much shorter, or may even get lucky enough to walk in and get seated immediately."}
{"text":"Eh. I was underwhelmed. I ordered pad thai and my portion was small and relatively tasteless. Trader Joe's frozen pad thai is far and above this place.  No knives on the table and I and my companions all struggled to eat with some modicum of table manners. My friends had the crispy fried duck drunken noodles and the catfish and they were all very pleased. Guess i just ordered the wrong thing.

Addendum -- ok I tried it again today, sampled across a lot of the menu (a big group of us ordered a ton of different stuff).  Even more disappointed this time.  Ick.  This is the Thai equivalent of McDonald's or Applebees.  If you are in Vegas and want decent Thai, try Pan Asian restaurant on S. Durango St."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The Khoa Soi tasted exactly like it did when we had it in Chiang Mai!  Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"It's simple really- this is the best Thai food in all states I've visited. New location is only 2 miles from the strip.

Service is a priority for them. The food can be a little pricey but a bargain compared to the casino restaurants."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  If you are on the strip, it's worth the ride to this place.  Food and service is excellent.  If you drive, there is a ton of free and easy parking.  

Favorite dish is the garlic prawns!

Couple of things to be aware of before you go.  Prices are higher than the average Asian restaurant.  But you get what you pay for!  And the wait can be very long so either make reservations or call ahead to see how long the wait is.  

This is one of our 2 go-to restaurants anytime we are in town!  

P.S.  Nan provided excellent service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant outside of Thailand, with Ruen Pair in LA in a close 2nd. 

I recommend ordering everything that has been mentioned in previous reviews. The Garlic Prawns are always a must. Believe the hype. 

The new location is closer to the central strip. Plenty of parking. We sat at the bar with zero wait time on a Saturday, NYE weekend. Very surprised."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can call this the best thai in LV. I'm sure there have to be several places that are better. The location is in a sketchy area. The food is very very reasonably priced. Service was great. The food was alright. Definitely not the best."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas.  Crispy duck is amazing and they also have a solid wine list."}
{"text":"We arrived with a party of three at lotus without a reservation and told them we had a show in an hour and a half so they were nice enough to rush us through despite wait being 45 minutes at the time. They even said our orders would be placed first and indeed it was; we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and the bill was brought during the end of our meal which was excellent since we had a show to see.

The food was excellent, i had duck curry at spice level for 1/10 which is mild to medium spice for an average person. last time I was here i got 5 which is basically insanely hot so I recommend going low if you haven't been here before. This is considered the best Thai restaurant in ALL OF NORTH AMERICA by numerous magazines and it definitely lives up to the hype.

*The show we went to see was Penn & Teller at the Rio and that was a great show. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Good quality Thai food if you're from out of town. I live in Southern California, so I'm a bit spoiled with good Thai food.
For me, it's a bit pricey, especially the duck curry and garlic shrimp (nothing special). However, all of the food here is very high quality and authentic, from the noodles to the curry and the soups. 
Service was also top notch.
Be prepared for about an hour wait at dinner time on a Friday or Saturday.
If there's not much Thai food around where you are from, I'd say definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"This place really strive for quality versus quantity. Unlike most Thai restaurants that I've been to, the portions are quite smaller. 

Arriving at 5:30pm on a Saturday( right when they open for dinner), the place is already super packed. Lines start to form inside & outside the restaurant. This place isn't at all located in the nicer part of town. 

Finally able to seat, we immediately order a round of Moscato, my favorite!! And oh my goodness best moscato I ever tasted. They do have a large selection of wines. As for foods we ordered-- garlic chicken wings, shrimp & chicken pad Thai, That beef salad, and duck drunken noodles. All pretty tasty. I'm usually used to having Thai food that is burning my tongue, so the lack of spiciness in the foods really surprised me. But I can not complain. The food was beyond delicious. The Pad Thai is one of the best I ever had. I love when my noodles come out cooked just right & not mushy and stuck together. 

The service was pretty slow but the place was extremely packed. Our food came out periodically and not all at the same time which we appreciated, so the table wasn't so cluttered. 

I definitely would return."}
{"text":"So this place is awesome!! I made a reservation at 8 o'clock on a Sunday night. I called the day of and they didn't have anything available but one table at 8 so I suggest to make a reservation the day before or if it's a weekend several days before. No liquor license yet so we brought our own bottles. No corkage fee either. I'm sure they'll get their license soon though so that will change. We got there and they couldn't seat us a immediately but they had comfy couches to sit and wait near the bar. Andreas (I believe was his name) a nice young man helped us out with opening up our wine and getting us the glasses we needed while we waited. We got seated in this nice little room in the back which was great. 

Food that we shared was the drunken noodles with sea bass, garlic prawns and crispy duck curry (all under chef specials) I personally loved the prawns. Im no expert on Thai food but I thought it was extremely delicious! There is a lot of menu so if you are waiting try to get a menu to look at."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars
Food: 5 stars

Amazing Thai food...probably the best I've had in the USA. Having lived in Asia and frequenting Thailand, the food here is truly amazing and quite authentic. We've tried several items off the menu - duck, sea bass, shrimp, noodles...all were fantastic!

The server was also very attentive. Our waters were always full, and they responded quickly to our requests. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Best Northern Thai food I've ever eaten. Can't wait to go back!!! Crispy duck, crispy rice and sake!!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a jewel!
You will wait for a table and it will be worth it!
I love there northern Thai food, it is hard to find!
Come here and enjoy"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! Authentic Thai cuisine in a modern, but still traditional vibe. 
All the staff we encountered were super friendly. Our server recommended ordering from the Northern Thai entrees so we decided on the garlic prawns and Kang Kare which were amazing!
The prawns are definitely a must have if you visit. 
It's a dish that I will order again and again every time I come here. 
We were offered dessert, but we were too full to get anything. That was a little disappointing. Note to self- don't stuff my face with garlic prawns so much so I can try the dessert. 
The prices aren't too bad either. The bill was just under $70 for garlic prawns, Kang Kare, pineapple fried rice, and 2 drinks. This was definitely more than enough for two people, could have easily fed 3. 
I'm just sad that this place is in Vegas, and I only came here as a visitor."}
{"text":"Really good and original Thai cuisine. A little pricey but worth the experience."}
{"text":"I've been told that this was rated \"Best Thai restaurant in the US\", and I have to say that it's true! The quality and flavoring of the food is worth it's expensive price. 

Reading through all the reviews although highly praised no one recommended any of the items. So my suggestion is anything with the pork. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to find some Thai food. We ended up yelping something and ended up here. The wait was around 30 minutes since we didn't have a reservation. The bar area was a little strange since it looked onto the entire dining area. I felt that people were looking at me awkwardly. 

Seated, waiter was very sneaky. Creeped up behind me quietly and startled me but it gave me a good laugh. We got an appetizer and a few entrees. The food was good, tasted as expected. But that wasn't even the best part. 

Don't get the duck addon for anything. The bill came and my friend was shocked that his portion was around $30 dollars. The waiter mistook him for wanting the dish with duck and wrote down \"crispy duck addon\" instead. Of course the \"preparation\" of frying the duck cost an additional $10 dollars, but of course the waiter did not know how much extra it would cost, and didn't think of asking a manager or something. I just thought it was hilarious."}
{"text":"It's so hard to rate a Thai restaurant a 5-star because there are so many everywhere and a lot of them taste the same, but in this case, I give Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas a 5-star! It is my benchmark for all Thai places that I visit... This restaurant is a MUST try if you live in, or visit Las Vegas.

Let's go through my recommendations:

1. Tom Yum Kai soup (5/5): The hot pot size feeds 5-6 and it's only $11.95. It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it has a good kick. The lemon grass and straw mushrooms make the soup taste amazing!

2. Crispy Duck with Panang  (5/5): I would actually rate this a 6 on a 5-point scale. This is my FAVORITE DISH at Lotus. The duck is so crispy with the curry on top of it. This dish is literally to die for.

3. Garlic Prawns (5/5): This is on the Chefs Choice menu - these are deep fried prawns with the shells on them and they are sautéed with garlic and pepper. Don't peel the shells! This is one of the most amazing dishes they have! Even though it's $21.95, it's very much worth the price. Get it!

4. Khai Soi Braised Short Rib (5/5): This is also on the Chefs Choice menu - another one of my personal favorites. The braised short rib is so tender; you can cut it easily with a fork. It's served over thai egg noodle in curry sauce, served with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This dish is a little pricey too at $20.95, but worth every penny.

5. Panang Curry with Chicken (4/5): The panang curry is really good here too. We rode it with chicken. It's only $11.95 for this dish, and it's a great traditional Thai dish to get with your meal.

6. Drunken Noodle Seafood (4/5): The drunken noodle seafood is one of their top recommendations. These are pan fried flat rice noodles served with an assortment of different seafood (mussels, calamari rings, shrimp, etc.). It is only $12.95, but I must warn that this is a little bit on the spicy side, i.e. more than we expected.

7. Pineapple Fried Rice (4/5): We ordered this to share with a larger group, and it was surprisingly really good. I normally don't order fried rice when I go to a Thai restaurant because I can make it at home, but this was really good. Only $9.95 too for a good-sized order of fried rice.

You can't go wrong with any of the options I've listed above. Of course, if there are just two of you going, you aren't going to order all 7 of the dishes (unless you are really hungry), but the top recommendations I have are the Crispy Duck Panang, the Garlic Prawns, and the Khai Soi Braised Short Rib. Not a whole lot of veggies in those options, but ehhhh, these are the best ones. Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can pay a visit to Lotus of Siam again. The restaurant itself is not in the best of neighborhoods, and from the outside, it looks like it could be a really crappy place, but do not be fooled. Go inside and taste the amazing savory dishes that I miss so dearly. Ok seriously, go there NOW!"}
{"text":"I ate there last week while in town for a trade show. It was our 3rd time there and the food is always good. However I got the fried Duck noddles this time which was very good, but I got terrible food poisoning the next morning. I don't think I'll be going there again....."}
{"text":"My go to Thai spot in Vegas.. everything here is great.. if you have kids you will most likely get seated in the back with the rest of us lol. We ordered the pad woon sen, Thai beef salad, some sort of curry and I think papaya salad. The food comes out quick and they have great service here. There is a parking lot as well"}
{"text":"It is really difficult to get a reservation at Siam.  The surroundings and ambience leave much to be desired (it is in a strip mall), but come for the food.  Service is adequate. Bathroom is passable but does not really inspire confidence in terms of cleanliness.

*The menu prices listed below are based on those on Yelp.  Siam's website does not list any prices.  I believe that the Yelp prices are out of date:

Satay ($9.95) was fine -- it comes in beef, pork, or chicken, but the restaurant does not allow you to mix and match.  I would pass.  Stuffed chicken wings ($10.95) were better -- juicy and a nice portion for two.

Garlic Prawns ($21.95) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle ($29.95).  Both are deep-fried so skip sides or unnecessary carbs.  The prawns come with white rice, and the drunken noodle is more than adequate.  Portions are not huge but are filling.

RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Greet food but the wait is really long, unless you make a reservation before. Mostly if you're party is big..."}
{"text":"I was impressed by all the awards and clips of magazine about the place that are hanged on the wall. It was very crowded on a Thursday night that we have to wait for more than 1/2 hr. And the restaurant was so noisy that night with all the tables filled up. 

There foods sure was delicious!!!! Certainly is the best Thai I have tasted so far. They do live up to their popularity. The crab fried rice was the best!! Also try the fried catfish salad, although the salad could use more veges. Their thai coffee is also very tasty. 

For those wine lovers - they have a huge selection of wine available.

Drawback - High price for small portion. We were expecting a family dinner portion, but the dish was just enough for one person. If you're hungry, order extra!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a shopping strip is super busy during dinner.  Make reservations or you'll find yourself waiting an hour easily.   I've been here twice and have very much enjoyed the food. We had the chicken wings,  crab fried rice, chicken satay, flat noodles, green curry and greens. Everything was really tasty and flavorful, especially the flat noodles in a brown sauce.  So good we ordered another serving.  The place from the outside looks sketchy but the food is legit."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai restaurant in America.

My wife is from Thailand, and I lived there for 4 years, so you could say we know Thai food.  

Lotus of Siam is very authentic.  The dishes which are traditionally not done well by American Thai restaurants are all excellent here.  In addition, it's the first place we've found in our travels around America that serves many of the excellent Northern Thai recipes not found elsewhere. (Try the Gaeng Hung Lay, a northern Thai stew of spiced long-simmered pork - it's outstanding!)

If you are just looking for Phad Thai or Satay you can find those anywhere - very few Thai people eat that stuff in Thailand, it's considered street food.  The focus here is on well-prepared specialty dishes and they don't disappoint.   We travel to Las Vegas once a year, and always wind up eating here 2-3 times during our stay.

Reservations are usually a \"must\" for dinner, as they fill up quickly (for a reason!)"}
{"text":"Amazing. We are locals and have come here several times. Never disappointed. Saying \"authentic\" is such an overused term, but I have to say it here. Lotus is the most authentic Thai food you will get outside of Bangkok. I'm Thai and I'm a harsh judge of Thai food. Make reservations if you can, otherwise it's worth the wait if you don't. Staff is so gracious and kind. I can't say enough wonder things about LoS."}
{"text":"If you must eat here, please make reservations.  People are already waiting in line half an hour before they open...  At first I was pretty skeptical because of the location and decor; I'm all about cleanliness..

The food was good, super fast!  But maybe \"super fast\" isn't a good thing...  We ordered:

Curry Duck Panaang (sp?) - duck was fresh, crispy, and hot; but curry sauce was luke-warm.  (5*****)
Pad Thai - one of the best Pad Thais that my fiancé and I have ever tasted.  Super hot and fresh.  (5*****)
Basil Chicken - luke-warm, light on flavor profile. (2**)

I would come back.  Definitely worth the reservation-wait, not the wait-in-line wait.

SO MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the green curry was a big hit with me. The menu is extensive and I love that the meat options include duck. I really enjoyed the roast duck with the drunken noodles. The meal would have been perfect if I didn't start off with their Tom Yum Koong soup. It was waaay too spicy! Don't get me wrong, I like my dishes spicy but their soups just went overboard. If you love spicy food, I would suggest getting the entrees really spicy and opting for milder with the soup and salad. It will make for a more pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever!!!
Service was fantastic. We were happy even the wait was a little bit long but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Part of the fun of Lotus of Siam is the bizarre, strip mall, risky neighborhood location. You can't help but be surprised when you enter and are greeted by walls covered in raving reviews and crowds of people. 

Maybe you read about Lotus of Siam in Gourmet magazine (that's how we found it), or you saw Anthony Bourdain enjoying the Garlic Prawns on CNN, or maybe you just kept hearing how amazing it is and that you simply must dine here if you're in Vegas!

Now that we've been here a few times, we have our favorites, and our favorite strategies. First, if you're going to dine in, be sure to call for reservations. We, however, love the take-out strategy and their take-out is fast! Just be sure to check your order before you leave, because they might have forgotten something, like your ... 

Garlic. Prawns. We almost left ours there because they didn't get included in our take-out order, and I think we would have shed tears if we had arrived back at home without them. They are crispy, flavorful, and quite unlike anything else I've tried. 

Our other favorites include the Kao Soi, which they make for us with just vegetables, and we enjoy most of the other items from the \"Northern\" menu, like the Tom Kha Gai. Be sure to specify how spicy you like your food -- on a scale of 1-10, a \"4\" here is pretty hot, and we like spicy. 

We visit Vegas at least once a year and stop here every time. It's an adventure that's worth a little drive!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner for the first time. 
Food was just ok, had better Thai food in my life and the portions are really really small. 3 people,  3 appetizers,  4 main courses and desert and we were not full... total disappointment. 2 stars are for service and decor."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam was one of the best (and affordable!) meals I had in Vegas. It was so good that it put me in a four hour food coma that left me missing all the activities on my last night in Sin City -- no regrets.

I highly recommend reservations since the line was hopping before it was even open. We were lucky enough to snag a last minute reservation and got to skip the long line of hot and hungry patrons outside. The decor here is warm and homey -- like every family owned Thai restaurant you would fine in your favorite suburban strip mall in Anywhere, America. Lotus of Siam specializes in Isan food which is pretty similar to the Laotian/Cambodian food I've had in the past meaning it was extra, extra delicious!

My best friend and I shared:
+ Garlic Prawns: The prawns are cut to look like the shell has molted off the flesh and then deep fried. Disgusting yes, but also very yummy and crunchy! As the menu said -- it's like potato chips! This hearty portion was on almost every table in the joint and for good reason too.
+ Panang Crispy Duck: Lotus of Siam does the deep fried game very well and this duck did not disappoint. I'm usually wary of duck curries because they can be very gamey but that was not the case at all -- this was recommended to us by our server since the bbq hen was not available and ended up being one of our favorite things on the menu!
+ Khao Soi - Burmese Egg Noodles in curry sauce. A unique dish that I have not seen on any other Thai menu near my house so we had to get this! It's super runny but totally worth the mess.
+ Nam Kao Tod: Crispy Rice Salad very similar to a Laotian dish I'm obsessed with. It was spicy and crunchy and full of different herbs and flavors! I recommend asking for extra lettuce to scoop this up since the cabbage they gave us was quite small and do not do the job right.

I would skip eggrolls or dumplings -- they are bland and not worth the space in your tummy.

I'll definitely be hitting this place up the next time I'm in Vegas. Thanks Chrissy Teigen (and everybody else in the world) for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"So, it's not \"as good as it gets\" but we certainly had a fine meal.  The Garlic prawns are as good as everyone raves about but even better.  They separate the meat from the shell and fry each to their optimum taste level.  The shell is yummy crunchy calcium goodness and the meat is tender moist and full of flavor.  Must have dish.  Everything else was good but I'm only going to rave about my favorite.  Oh yeah, the downside was the 2 hr wait on Monday night and the 30 minutes wait for the food after we ordered.  So, we ended up eating at around 9:45 pm which was pretty late in our schedule."}
{"text":"Place blows me away every time..
I love to see a cidre from Brittany amazing pairing w spicy...
Ironically, I put a review on chada street yelp saying he should get a cidre. THat was before I knew lotus had a cidre. 

Stay northern and order things you never would otherwise and you will eat amazing food.. Expect terrible and rude service that's how u know you are in a good Thai spot. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded expectations! Best Thai food in Vegas to date! Do be fooled by the outside, the indoor atmosphere is beautiful and the staff are friendly and professional. I will return here again."}
{"text":"If you love and can stand fried food, go for the garlic prawns and stuffed chicken wings. Crispy duck is so-so, more on the fatty side and not as crispy."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is top-notch!
Perfect for any occasion: date night, girls night, just because, with your out-of-town guest visiting Vegas.

It's little more high end, than your favorite pad Thai go-to.
Don't be like me and ask for cocktails lol Like I said, it's little more high end. They have wine cellar room by the entrance, sommelier on site, coming to your table to take your drink orders, then comes your server who takes your food orders. They also serve some varieties of beer.

We ordered fried fish cake with sweet and sour peanut sauce for appetizer.
Very pungent flavor of fish sauce and cilantro mixed in fish cake, matched perfectly with sweet and sour sauce. Cucumber in the sauce was very refreshing and good combo with fish cake which was fried to crispy perfection outside, yet soft and slightly chewy inside.

I had studied yelp reviews since I found out we were going here, and I knew I had to order Crispy Duck Khao Soi!!
Hand cut egg noodle works very well with coconut curry because more surface, the more curry it holds on to.
Crispy Duck,,,what can I say? It's Crispy Duck. I'm a fan. #nuffsaid

Third dish we ordered was by our servers recommendation, one of their most ordered dish, Garlic Prawns.
It's not just fried shrimp. You can enjoy crispy fried shell, and very meaty shrimp, also fried crispy, in garlic, chili and some other flavor. I just appreciate chefs' skill and patience in peeling prawns so they are still intact as one piece after battering and frying and mixing with seasoning.

It was just me and my husband, so of course I got about 1/3 of khao soi and 1/2 of garlic shrimp to go. 

I cannot wait to go back there, with bigger party next time, so we can order bunch of different dishes and try them all!

Service was fast, courteous, and timed perfectly. 

You HAVE TO make reservation to go here, unless you don't mind waitting 1h or so."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was delicious, but on the smaller end for my typical Thai experiences. The decor is littered with celebrities and wine bottles. From the outside it resembles a small family owned Thai restaurant, but inside it is a large venue with plenty of seating. Try it cause we did and the rest of the lambs that followed the Anthony Bourdain wolf trail..."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a beautifully decorated space. The ambiance was ideal for a relaxing dinner and the service was outstanding. Our waiter recommended the crispy duck and garlic prawns - both solid choices! I wish I was hungrier so I could have tried more dishes. They also have a bitcoin ATM which was pretty cool. I was able to buy bitcoin before dinner so that was very convenient. I highly recommend Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. We ordered the fried wontons for appetizers and had Pad Thai for our main course. It takes a little while to get your food and the service is decent. I do love their wine selection however."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here for quite some time now, and finally made it here last night. And tonight. Yeah. Yum-EEEE!! I highly recommend the beef satay with peanut sauce. It's a great appetizer and next time I'm here I may have 3 orders of just THIS!! It is marinated to perfection and I could almost drink the peanut sauce it's that good. The pad thai was also exceptional. If this place keeps this up, I may be going here for quite some time."}
{"text":"Always a great meal.  Probably the best Thai in Las Vegas. It's off the beaten path but worth the cab ride to get there if you are staying on the strip."}
{"text":"OMFG.  The best Thai food I have EVER had! In Vegas, who knew?!

We came here with a large group so we tried several dishes.  First off, service is really great and friendly.  Our server made a lot of great suggestions and had no problem answering our questions about dishes.  We had the deep-fried garlic prawns, khao soi (curry noodle dish), sai oua (sausage), red and green chili dips, kang hung lay (beef stew), crispy duck with panang sauce, sea bass with ginger, pad thai, and some sticky rice.  

The prawns were superb, deep-fried but not greasy at all and the batter has some great seasoning.  For me the khao soi was the standout dish, everyone loved it and by the end of the meal people were spooning up the curry sauce to eat over rice because it was so good.  I also highly recommend the chili dips.  The green chili was my favorite and reminded me of Mexican green chili because it came with tiny little pork rinds to eat with it. The sai oua had a great flavor.  When you bring it up to your mouth to eat it, you can catch a whiff of the aromatics it's spiced with.  I also really enjoyed the crispy duck and the sea bass was perfectly cooked and tender.  I really enjoyed my meal here.  And dessert was fantastic as well. I highly suggest getting the combo desert plate which comes with crispy fried bananas (they look like fried spring rolls with banana inside instead of veggies) and coconut ice cream over sticky rice.  Heavenly.

If you come here and are overwhelmed by the expansive menu, I would highly recommend being adventurous and ordering mainly off the Northern Thai and Chef's Choice menus.  Parking is plentiful, and because there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate area, grabbing a cab back to the Strip is not very difficult.  I highly recommend making a reservation because there seems to be a serious wait otherwise.  Definitely worth the 2 mile trip off the Strip for great quality That cuisine. The hype is all true!"}
{"text":"Considering that Gourmet magazine said it was the best Thai restaurant in North America, AND that Frommers highly recommended it, I expected a lot more. My boyfriend and I both had the wonton soup (excellent) and the chicken with cashew nuts. Personally, I've had much better at other Thai restaurants. 

It's a run-down little place, but obviously plenty of people know about it. Autographed pictures with celebrities adorn the walls. Service is okay, but nothing exceptional. It was often hard to track down our server."}
{"text":"First off, this place can be easily missed if you've never been in the area. You can not see it from the street front. 

I've heard lots of good things about this place & the restaurant quickly filled up after we got there. We ordered way too much food as always LOL. But I must say this isn't the best Thai food I've had. It was decent.. I thought I was gonna be in shock from how good it was gonna be."}
{"text":"Dear Mr.Talkative Man, 

I like spending my hour flight with you to Las Vegas. You were  so funny and there was so much to learn about in such a short amunt of time. I would like to thank you by telling me about Lotus of Siam. 

I have to say the location is kinda hidden. I had a hard time finding it with my GPS. It is in a stip mall that looks run down. I would never think that such a place would be so popular. 

I came here with Kim D.  I was so happy to see lemon grass drink on the menu. I have looked at all of the dinning places in the Bay Area and have not ever seen it on the Menu.

 I tried it once when I was on a trip to Thialand.  I remered to being sweeter with a fuller taste to it.  The one at Lotus of Saim brought me back to Thailand. It is not as sweet and taste as if there has been more water added to the drink. That being said it was still good.

We had also odered a soup it was sweet and sour with chicken and coconut. It was the best soup I have ever had. Notes of lemon and coconut rang out. A dance that came together. I wish I could bring it home. 

We had also odered the Pad Thai with shrimp and eggs whites only. the pad thai was only oki. 

the last dish was Larb with pork. It was only oki as well."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is awesome and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"It's a long wait which we were expecting.  What we were not expecting was the poor food quality.  Our food was cold.  Not just one dish but all 3 of them.  This place is over-hyped.  I had better Thai food paying $7 at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to! Its in an obscure, generic stripmall, but the dining room is busy, and very clean. Service was prompt, warm and friendly. Panang curry was delicious. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious we ordered 7 dishes which included a typical Burmese influenced dish is served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, with your choice of meat; garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables.
So delicious.  
The other dishes were more of he como dishes papaya salad, Panang curry and BBQ pork. The BBQ pork was a bit dry and the fat needed to be rendered a bit more. 
The service was exceptional.  Right on top of it I was happy that they still seated us we got there at 9:45 which is normally when they close the kitchen but they seated us still yey!"}
{"text":"Yes indeed this is the best Thai restaurant in North America. Does it have some fame and press with all those famous chefs and celebrities that frequent this place, Yes, but it delivers in quality, creativeness and authenticity. Its not cheap since you are paying a little bit for its reputation and fame but the food is great. A must when you are in Vegas. Go before 6:30pm to avoid the long lines. If you are new to Thai food and are the adventurous type, just ask the waiters to order for you. Tell them your likes and dislikes and approximately how much you want to spend and let them take care of it. It is the most fun way to eat."}
{"text":"Easily the one of best Thai food places in Las Vegas. From an incredible wine selection to amazing appetizers and delectable main dishes. The green chicken curry was super on point!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! I cant quite give this place 5 stars but it is pretty close to it. Before getting into the food, just the ambiance and great service alone makes this place wonderful.

Anyways, I was fortunate enough to come here with 5 other people that were also extremely hungry--I didn't keep full count but it seemed like we ordered 10-11 different things. We had heard the the Northern style food on the menu was something not often found anywhere else, so we ordered a lot from that section. As for the highlights in what we ordered, my favorites were the Garlic Prawns and Papaya Salad. The prawns were so freaking tasty and crunchy. It tasted so good you could probably eat the shell too... The papaya salad was really the only item we got that had some heat too it. It was a delicious compliment to any other main dish you got.

The reason I am knocking a star off the perfect rating is all 3 dishes my girlfriend and I ended up getting were just pretty good. The jack fruit + pork dish sounded interesting but I realized the two together ended up being redundant, as it all came to be one texture and flavor. The red chili dip was fun, but was just a bit too salty and lacked other flavors. Finally, in the sausage, all I could taste was lemongrass; it wasn't bad just not amazing.

All in all this was a place with many food choices and elegant decor. I would recommend trying many different dishes to find the ones that fit your taste."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for four days and went here three times. Such a different experience than most Thai restaurants you find in the U.S. I would recommend that you try items that you wouldn't normally see on menus in the area (things like the duck noodle soup and crispy rice were some of the best items on the menu). I only wish that this was closer to home so I could be a regular."}
{"text":"Spicy Catfish Salad is my favorite dish here.

Food here used to be really good, but came here twice in the past month and I have to say they really disappointed me.

Portions are very small.

Service is really lousy.

The crispy rice is very salty and doesn't taste good.  Their specialty beef (forgot its name...grilled beef thinly sliced with tamarind and coconut sauce) used to be my favorite, but this time is just mediocre

Really sad this happened.  I usually look forward to going here every time we go to Vegas, but not sure if we would like to come here again.

There are so many other places which are worth visiting.  Maybe i'll be back in a couple of years....so long"}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious. If you a food critic or love Thai food, this is the place. From pad Thai to Tum Yum, a ace that is a must try. The wine menu is awesome and can service any budget."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to find something to eat off the strip and we found this place on yelp. Decided to stop by and was told the wait was 2-3hrs for a party of 5. It was cool with us because we weren't that hungry and they let us put our number down so they will call us when it's ready and we can then decide if we still wanted to come. The wait turned out to be only about 1hr. I had imagined the place to be rather small since the waiting area was pretty tight. It was pretty cool to see all the news article written about the place.

The food there was absolutely delicious. I actually think about the food I ate there still pretty much every day. We ordered a lot of the recommended items yelpers suggested. The Drunken Noodle Garlic Prawn shrimp was amazing! The prawns were freaking goood! It was 22 dollars but so worth it! The Nam Cam Tod...i think that's what it's called was also very unique. Never had anything like it before but it was so very good. For a group of 5 we ordered Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp, Drunk Noodle Garlic Prawn, Drunken Noodle with Seafood, Pineapple fried rice, Nam Kom Tod. Our bill came out to be 125 and we had a lot of leftover that we ate later that night. I'm for sure going back to this place next time and recommending to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Wow, how have I not written a review for this place yet?

You can't go wrong with any dish here, which is what makes this restaurant so great. I'll admit, not every dish is amazing, but at least you won't be stuck with something yucky. It all just comes down to how much you love Thai food.

The wait is typically fairly long (waited 1 hour last time for a table for 3 on a Sunday night), but this time we only waited 15 minutes for a table on a Friday night. Luckily, tables for 2 typically get seated much quicker.

We ordered:
- Panang Curry: The curry had really good flavor, but I thought it was kind of plain. They don't give you any additional vegetables.

- Pad Thai: The noodles are different from your norm (they're thinner), but the flavor is good. I got mine with fried tofu and the fried tofu is really yummy! I normally don't like meats with my pad thai because they are normally made dry, but next time, I'll definitely try it with chicken. I don't think Lotus of Siam will disappoint.

- Mango Sticky Rice: THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL.This is the best mango sticky rice I've had. The rice is not actually too sticky and is made perfectly! MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in US? I wouldn't know and I'm certainly not a Thai expert.  Best Thai food I've ever had? DEFINITELY (and this includes a short trip to Bangkok, but I was not so adventurous then)!

I've been here twice, and each time I came out FULLY satisfied.  First time I went, I followed other yelper's advice, and asked our waiter for suggestions.  This is not a place you get your pad thai and call it a day, you want to experience their specialties that you can't get anywhere else.  Our waitress was very patient and recommended all winners.  Second time, I brought my parents here and at the end of the meal, my mom said, \"I never understood your fascination with Thai food before, but now I finally do.\"  Yes, it's that good =).

Here are some of my must orders: 
- Tom Ka soup: my friend told me you can tell if a Thai restaurant is good by its soup.  I haven't tried too many Tom Ka's, but this one's sure tasty to me!
- Crispy duck panang:  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.  The duck is fried until crispy, and plated on a bed of panang sauce.  In fact, I'm sure any of its crispy duck options will be good.
- Sea bass with drunken noodles (or any other combo with drunken noodles): if you're a sea bass lover, this dish is for you.  The drunken noodle is somewhat similar to pad kee mao, but better.  We've also had it with prawns, HUGE prawns came out, the meat was so fresh and bouncy, yum yum.
- Braised short ribs: we had it with some kind of curry.  The ribs were fall of the bone tender, and the flavor was very rich, you can tell it's been stewing for hours.  

Also, try the Nam Kao Tod if you haven't, it's definitely different.  Some love it, I'm just okay with it.  But I still get it just to introduce it for the others.   

There're still so many other dishes that I have yet to try.  It's a definite must go every time I go to Vegas now.  Yes, it's a bit of a hassle since it's in the middle of nowhere, but if you love great food, do yourself (and your stomach) a favor and grab a taxi now!  Although, you might not want to go clubbing right after, give yourself 2 hours to digest before the party begins."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about LOS for such a long time. Today, on a whim, we decided to finally check the place out.

Pad See Ewe w/chicken (4.5/5)

Very tasty and full of flavor, this is the dish I was most impressed with during my meal. Just the right combination of sweet and salty. Portion was just moderate, not generous but also not too small. I enjoyed the pad see ewe very much and will definitely order it again.

Larb (1.5/5)

Quite the disappointment, both in terms of taste and portion size. First of all, the portion size was surprisingly miniscule and left me wanting more food. Not necessarily more of this larb, just more of some kind of food. Taste was also a let down as the portion tasted very bland. No more larb from LOS for me.

Service (3/5)

We apparently went during the lunch rush, so it was quite busy. The service was adequate, but nothing outstanding. Granted, they were slammed, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Ambiance/ Room (2/5)

I dig enjoy the wine cellar and bar area. Very cool. Otherwise, it seemed like an old, tacky mish mosh of items. Plus the tables are squeezed in too tight together, IMO. I could easily hear conversations around me with no effort at all. Plus the actual location is in a pretty sketchy area to begin with.

Although it did not live up to the hype, it was still pretty good. We have already decided we are definitely coming back to try other menu items and hopefully that will happen during a slower time. 

3 stars.

A-Ok."}
{"text":"04/10/2014:

This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place. 

We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer. 

Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine. 

I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place. They are hooked too. Always a must for me when in Vegas. Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them."}
{"text":"No the best I've had else where in the country, but very very good. 

Huge menu, pages long, WOW 

Prices were very very good, especially for Vegas. 

I would go here again and recommend. 

Great Thai experience. Our server Mike was great. 

Don't let the outside fool you, it's nice and authenticate on the inside."}
{"text":"Visited from LA. Was recommended by my friend who used to live in LV. Located in a scammy plaza just like he said. Inside is bright, clean, a different world just like he said. 
Got the garlic prawn everyone was raving about. I m totally on that rave. 'Sea bass on drunken noodle' was also a bomb though it's bit pricey (about $30). 
In fact, the price is generally high. 
Got the above two + papaya salad + tom yum koong soup + soft shell crab salad + duck panang curry + 1 thai tea + tip = $180 
The portions are not huge; Finished all dishes with 3 other thai-food-loving girls who just had a 2 hr full blast at mandalay bay pool. Never have a i ever paid this much for thai food without alcohol BUT was worth it. I'd go again. Especially for the garlic prawn."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant ever - don't worry these guys really do live up to all of the hype.  Why else would semi-inebriated foodies from around the country quietly ask their cab drivers to drive down E Sahara blvd for dinner.  \"The Sahara hotel miss?\" - no cabbie, I said the creepy dilapidated shopping center on Sahara Blvd next to the discount wig shop.  

Once you enter LOS the restaurant itself is much nicer than the location would suggest, and the waitstaff could not be nicer or more attentive.  Best bets include the crispy rice with sour sausage appetizer.  It is literally a party in your mouth - so many different textures and tastes.  There are a bunch of fresh herbs, deliciously crispy rice, cubes of sour sausage, cucumbers, peanuts, chillies, and red onion.  I only wish they would serve it in a giant cereal bowl with a big wooden spoon.  I also love their chicken wings with garlic and pepper.  They are so crispy and addictive, a perfect starter.  For main courses I love all their noodles and curry.  Friends have raved about the scallops as well.  However my favorite dish came on my last visit and was the drunken noodles with giant prawns.  The noodles were wide and spicy atop of lettuce and had a huge portion of perfectly fried shrimp on top.  The dish was amazing if no a bit pricey at $20 - but the portion was very large and included 8 prawns.  

Finally the perfect ending is the mango, sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I do not exaggerate when I say this is my favorite dessert of all time.  I have never had better mangoes than those I have at LOS.  Legend says that the chef rejects 75% of the mangoes they receive because they do not meet his standards.  They are the most perfect and sweet mangoes you will ever have.  Best of all, the fine staff at LOS will call a cab for you as you are finishing dessert so that your transportation is waiting for you at the end of your meal.  Truly a wonderful experience, and well worth the cab ride off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Well.  I don't even know what to say.

What our table of eleven ordered: fried tofu, crispy duck panang curry, yom yum kai, garlic prawns, pad see ew, chicken thai fried rice, chilean sea bass in sa-mm rod sauce, coconut ice cream, fried banana & mango with sticky rice and thai iced teas.

What we got: yum x 1000, great service, great food, great efficiency, clean bathrooms, bright ambience (inside at least), okay parking and a fantastic experience all around.

The awards and all the doodads, certificates, etc. are there for a reason - this place is legit.  This may be the best Thai food we've ever ever ever eaten (including my dad, whose opinion on Asian food I hold in the highest regard, was surprised and pleased with this place - trust me, that's a hard act to do).  

I'd be back, I'll make a reservation in advance, anticipate a slight wait, but I know it's worth it.  Good gosh it's worth it."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall but the food is very, very good.  I got the papaya salad (warning: super spicy) and the duck Penang curry (fantastic).  $22 for dinner?  A steal.  

HOWEVER: I came in as a solo female diner.  I was pretty much ignored by the server the entire meal.  It took forever to get water (I had to ask for it when he finally came to take my order) and he never came back to ask how my appetizer was.  When my main course came out, I asked the runner for more water (I had finished the glass) and he never returned with it.  I also needed a clean small plate.  I waited and waited and finally flagged my server for those two simple things.  Then he didn't come back to check on me until I was 75% done with my main course.  And he wasn't slammed.  I've waited tables before.  He wasn't in the weeds. 

So, in summary: food - delish.  Service - seriously lacking."}
{"text":"The single greatest Thai restaurant outside of Thailand..
this place is mecca for thai food - you must come here if you like Thai food.. it's that good.

Note: it's in a strip mall, and on a busy vegas weekend, it can be a wait to get a taxi out of here. best to have a car rental to visit here.

Crispy duck, the panang curry, the Fried Cod, dear god.. it's truly magnificent.

Before Bank, the wine manager left to open his own place (Chada), the wine program was also world class/legendary.. it's now a shell of what it was before (it used to be the best Riesling collection just about anywhere).

All in all.. you just have to come here.. it's that good."}
{"text":"Tried the red chili dip, deep fried catfish (our fav), crispy rice, crispy duck panang (THANK YOU, yelpers!!!!!) , and some sort of street noodles. Still our favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my fave restaurant in Vegas.   I love the appetizer Nom Kao Tod.  It has crispy rice, pork, cllantro, lemon grass, red onion, lime or lime juice.   I wish they would make it as an entree.  I sometimes order 2 orders and make it my entrée.   The Tom yum Khai soup is great and pad thai also is great.   The waiter asks what # of spicy/hot you want each dish. I do not think I've ever ordered over a 6 because your mouth becomes on fire at that point.  The restaurant atmosphere is nothing fancy but the whole thing just \"works\".  I have a 40 min drive to this place but gladly do it when my Thai cravings activate."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night with a reservation. We were seated on time and right away, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and attentive to our table.

Our order:
1) Tom yum shrimp soup
2) pad see ew pork
3) northern larb
4) crispy duck Panang curry 
5) Thai tea

We got our Thai tea right away and it was really good with the right amount of sweetness but a bit pricey at $5 for a small mason jar

We then received our food rather quickly, the crispy duck panang curry was the highlight of our meal. It was milky and the curry perfectly harmonized with the crispy duck skin and tender duck meat. It was very pricey at $28.95 for such a small dish, but very tasty.

Everything else was just average. The portions are pretty small and they don't make it up with taste. The Tom yum was nothing special but the shrimp was fresh, but they raised the price to $17, which was also pricey.

Overall, I would just come here to order the crispy duck panang, but not for the other Thai dishes. They are over priced and small portions. You can get tastier and cheaper Thai food elsewhere. Come here for their specials, not for regular Thai food."}
{"text":"Its very authentic, but I just cannot give it 5 stars, I have had better before.  I love an know my thai, love the service, love the wine, the drinks, the coconut ice cream with fried bananasa, the spicey northern style chicken noodle soup, the appetizer was my favorite, a larb like crispy rice dish with mint, lime, and the best little crunchy rices ever.   I give it a solid, 4, its really a 4.50 if I could cut it here, but its not 5 star yet.   The place is worth the trek to the most ghetto strip mall in Las Vegas Proper, I think it was built in the 50s, its crazy how much parking is in this lot for the number of shops, but its got some really good food in the strip mall.   The decor is classy and the glass wine cellar you can see from you seat with 1000+ bottles is pretty damn impressive.   4.5 Solid stars.   Get hungry , and go!  Spicey Thai with top line service!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic. Duck Panang was just outstanding and the BBQ shrimp had some of the most vibrant thai flavors I've ever had.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I make a lot of jokes about Mexican restaurants being best when they are hole-in-the-wall types, perhaps even former radiator shops turned taqueria, but in Las Vegas the best Thai restaurants are the ones you can't walk into without fear of being mugged. 

And might I say, had I been mugged it would still be worth it for Lotus of Siam! 

Same shopping center as The Green Door, make a night of it!   

I was brought here almost a year ago for my birthday as I thought I loved Thai food, however, LOS turned my love into an obsession. I had the Tom Kha Kai. Best I've ever had. It was the perfect balance of sweet and spice, I ordered a 10, and it seemed to grace my tongue like silk. The coconut and lemongrass danced on my tongue like a beautiful ballerina. There was no overpowering of flavors, no, only complimenting like Kanye speaks of Kanye. 

Yes, I exaggerate but you know food is good when you think about it every time a Sade or Adele song comes on."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This would actually make me consider moving to Las Vegas.

The girls and I went to Vegas (from LA) for a girls weekend and we wanted, no needed, Thai food. Hangovers you see. So, some Tom Kha Kai was not an option but a necessity. We asked the conceirge at our hotel where some good Thai places were and once he found out we had a car he told us to go here and I am now going to call The Rio to tell them that guys needs a raise! The guy said it was perhaps \"the best Thai food in the country\" and I sort of chuckled to myself because I KNOW the best Thai is in Norwalk at Renu Nekorn. What did he know? Ha!

When we got there I was ready to start talking sh#t because it was in some funky strip mall in BFE. But then I thought to myself, all the great local spots are in funky strip malls. So I wedged my way through the horde of people in the waiting area and saw the walls plastered with reviews from just about every news source you can think of. Thought it was a decent sign so I made our reservation and decided to wait the 25 minutes for a table.

As I stood by the wall my friend says to me, \"hey didn't you guys live in Norwalk? This says the chef is from Norwalk.\" To my pleasant surprise the chef is the SAME EXACT chef from Renu Nekorn! How's that for a kick in the pants! Apparently he had enough of So Cal and moved to Vegas like every other person in the 702. I was even more excited to see that most of the items on the menu were identical to the menu from the Norwalk location. Happy day!

I can't even tell you what I ordered because I was in a food coma from start to finish. I left full, buzzed, and happy with money left in my pocket which is more than I can say for my departure from the rest of Vegas.

They also do take out so you can pre-order and get it to go. If you're staying on the strip there were plenty of cabs waiting outside to take people anywhere they wanted to go so don't fret if you want to venture out sans self-transportation. However you decide to get there - just go. Now.  I will absolutely go back the next time I'm in Vegas but this time I will do it with a reservation."}
{"text":"So we went back. Yes. Not a week passed by and we went back. 

Service: Outstanding. Our server was Ploy (I think). So sweet and knowledgeable. She balanced so many tables like a rockstar! 

Food: Red Curry Beef, Nam Prik Ong and Basil and Chili Chicken. All Level 7 heat. The heat was perfect - just the right amount of burn without taking away from enjoying the food. The food was just so good. I really can't rave about it enough. Thank goodness I live a little farther away so I can't come here everyday! 

Also, all the food we've eaten is gluten free, and I haven't felt sick afterwards either time! 

We also got a Thai Iced Tea to go. Do not leave without this! So good. Perfect end to our meal. I'd go back for the tea alone ;-) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 8:30 PM local time. Yes, it was packed due to the rave and popularity of this place. They need to give a big thanks to Anthony Bourdain for it!! Any ways, we got there and with no reservations they told us at least an hour and half wait. You give them your phone number and they text you when you table is ready. We decided to go out and stop by the convenience store to pick up items we needed and with a surprise we got texted within about 30 minutes. I am giving this place a 5 because food was very good and I have been Bangkok before and food is comparable to it. Just as good or even better than some places in Thailand. Service was also wonderful, you don't expect much service at Asian restaurants but this was an exception. Probably first Asian restaurant I have been too where they had a host/hostess, bus boy, and waiter/waitress. I would love to come back again just to try other items.

Food - 5/5   Very delicious and comparable to Thai food in Thailand. We had the crispy duck with Panang. Duck was extra crispy and that curry sauce was to die for!!! Also, had the Drunken noodle with Sea Bass. This was exceptional as well but I thought kind of pricey. Didn't get as much of the fish I was expecting. I wanted to the try the Garlic shrimp that everybody raves about here but since we only had two people we didn't order it. Maybe next time.

Service - 5/5   Best service I had in an Asian restaurant.  

Tip - Make sure you make a reservation if you go on a weekend or else you will be waiting for a long time especially if you have more than two people."}
{"text":"whoa, this place is in a sketchy plaza. was not expecting that. 

we checked in online and were seated within five minutes. food was solid, nothing to really blow your mind. maybe there just isn't a ton of thai food in vegas and that's why this spot is so popular and hyped? not sure. it's HUGE inside and was definitely packed, so try and make a reservation ahead of time or get in the queue online if you can.

my favorite was the duck. we also got curry, which was supposed to be mild so my daughter could eat it, but it was still kind of spicy and i couldn't give her any. not a negative thing, i love spicy! just a bummer they couldn't really make it mild since my daughter lovessss curry. 

we got four dishes and they were all delicious. no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Good but not Great.

I tried the red curry without coconut milk curry with chicken, the number sixty seven. The sauce was very balanced and excellent. The chicken was undeveloped and dry but even if I ignore the execution of the chicken I can't ignore all the old tasting canned or bottled mini corns that mostly made up my dish. It's a shame because the other vegetables in my dish were very fresh and good and the spice and heat level were excellent.

My husband had a beef and vegetable platter that was on the next page. The beef in his dish was also undeveloped and almost seemed boiled. Again the sauce was good. The vegetables in his dish were fresh.

Both dishes were very small portions.

Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"While the old venue was probably a truer celebration of it's Vegas locale; Lotus of Siam has broke the mold at their new location. Gone are the glitzy headshots that helped build it's reputation around the world and here they have a venue worthy in quality and ambience of the food they've served all these years. 

Favorites here are the Crispy Duck Panang, Garlic Prawns, Beef Jerky, and for you weirdos out there the water is particularly good. You know what I mean. 

Cheers to your success!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in North America.  Hands down.

I consider myself a Thai food fanatic- and had friends in Las Vegas who constantly were bragging that they had the \"best thai restaurant\"...  Thinking I knew everything- I doubted them, and was proved wrong.

My first visit had me quite surprised when we walked into the storefront in a dilapidated strip mall to meet a huge glass wine cellar, world-class service, and killer food.

I had the Pad Thai on my first trip as that is always a safe bet... it was quite good- but the soups, and appetizers really blew me away.  My buddy ordered his favorite, the #58 which I tasted and immediately had bad food envy.  

My second trip I ordered this and it was as good as I had remembered.  On this trip, I brought my CEO, and several colleagues...  One of which being a major foodie.  They were all flabbergasted.  My CEO said several days later that he would never be able to order Scallops again as they could never top Lotus..

I will simply not go back to Las Vegas without eating at Lotus of Siam.  Cannot recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for quality Thai food in Las Vegas since I got here, and most places have come up short. Lotus of Siam was great compared to other places, but they did come up short of my expectations. I went during lunch, so it wasn't very busy, and the service was fairly quick. The portion size was decent for the price and the food was actually really good, but not nearly as epic as expected. When you have a title like \"Best Thai restaurant in North America,\" I'm going to walk in with high expectations. However, I've found that many restaurants tend to be exponentially better during dinner as opposed to lunch, so that may have been the reason, and I'll give them a pass this time. It was no doubt one of the better Thai places I've tried in Las Vegas, but I definitely need to do some more eating, I mean research, before I could consider it the BEST in North America."}
{"text":"Very good thai food at very reasonable price.  We ordered the crispy garlc prawns.  The shrimp was deshell but still attached at the butt and deep friend and seasoned very well.  The beef salad was also very good with chunky piece of meat. The pad thai was good a int of sweet and lime. The crispy duck in panang curry was cook very well not too dry and the curry did not over power the duck."}
{"text":"While attending CES 2011 a friend suggested I try Lotus of Siam as it was Zagat rated.  We called and could not get a reservation. So this year, before arriving to CES 2012 I made sure we called in two weeks ahead for reservations to take my team there.

We arrived at the restaurant which was large and packed.  Excitement was building by everyone.  We ordered a recommended beef salad, the Tom klong soup (similar to Tom yum Kai but recommended by our waitress), Padang chicken, yellow Curry chicken, chop suey and the highly recommended garlic prawns.

Well...  I have had Thai in many places and unfortunately this experience was not up there.  The recommended beef salad had a thick sauce, reminded me of Chinese style dish.  Not that good.  The soup was good and so was the chop suey (which also seemed more Chinese than Thai).  Nothing wrong but we were expecting more Thai cuisine.  The panang was ok.  The yellow curry was good. And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price.

In conclusion, we left the place wondering why it was rated 4 stars.  I would rate the food 3 stars and would give our waitress 4 stars for great service.  

Hope this helps you in your decision especially if you're a big Thai fan."}
{"text":"Like what other reviews indicate:
  - exterior of restaurant is deceiving because of location but owner really deck her interior eatery very nice
  - garlic crispy pawn was DELICIOUS; pawn was semi separated from the shell when fried.
    really crispy where you eat ALL of the shrimp, shell and meat.
  - ordered one of the pad thai and it was well seasoned and satisfied our appetite.

Since many review mentioned what I want to say so no need to repeat except WOW, DELICIOUS FOOD THAT SATISFIED my husband's & my appetite.  didn't have a chance to try to duck or any other food since there was only 2 of us.  If in LV again, will want to bring the family here to try more food."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best Thai food I've ever had, period, end of story.  The first time I attempted to dine here I was told there was a 45 minute wait...that was on a Sunday at about 8:30 PM.  Not willing to wait that long I decided to try again the next day.  Wow am I glad I did.  This place looks a little run down and isn't in the greatest area of town but it's completely worth venturing out of your comfort zone for this place.  They must have a good thing going considering the wait times and it was PACKED both nights at off-peak times.

For dinner I had the Drunken Noodle Prawns and the Crispy Duck Panang Style.  The Drunken Noodle Prawns were amazing, that's all I can say.  I don't even know what the sauce and spices were but this dish blew me away.  The crispy duck was decent but I'm not a huge fan of duck to begin with...the red curry that it was with was some of the best curry I've ever tasted however. I will substitute the duck for chicken or beef next time and all will be well!  Service was great and very attentive. The waiter new the menu well, was prompt and the timing was spot on.

Definitively give this place a shot.  It's in the East Sahara and Maryland Parkway area and worth the drive from anywhere in town."}
{"text":"Not impress at all. Tom Yam soup was one star, it taste like plain water added with lime and chilies flake. Panang curry was like Chinese or Mexican cook prepare that dish. Chilean sea bass with Som Tam salad was not exciting and authentic. Grapes and apple was added to som tam salad. Go back to the authentic flavor of Thailand please.
Somehow the place was busy and crowded. I guess that is call faith or no better choice in Vegas.
Service and the support staff was very nice and professional. 
Komol restaurant near by was much better quality of taste."}
{"text":"Very, very good Thai food, but not the best I've had (that honor remains with the much mourned Planet Thailand in Brooklyn). The take-home message: the food is great and there's nothing to complain about, but there's room for improvement here and there in the dishes.

I went with a group, and we shared several dishes. The Pad Thai was very good--fresh, complex, and a good mixture of flavors, though I thought it could have had more depth of flavor--more contrast between sweet and salty, tart and spicy. Our Tom Kah Kai was fabulous--piping hot, spicy, rich and complex. The green papaya salad was fresh and tart, though not quite as flavorful as I would have liked. My Panang curry with chicken was delicious, but extremely spicy even when ordered medium. The service was very good, the beer was cold, and it wasn't too hard finding cabs to take us back to our hotel. Best of all: Lotus of Siam isn't on the Strip!

I'll definitely go back if fate ever forces me to return to Las Vegas.

A note about how I rate: It seems to me that people mean very different things by the stars they give in a review. Here's what I mean: 5 stars means that a place is exceptional in some way, special even among very good peers; 4 stars means that the place is very good in every relevant category but not outstanding or exceptional; 3 stars means adequate--a place I would go to again but not great; 2 stars means unacceptable--a place I would not go again because it is seriously deficient in some way; 1 star is horrible, that the place  was not only unacceptable in some way but that it was exceptionally, unforgivably bad. In every case my rating is comparing the place reviewed to similar places-- thus an outstanding diner gets a 5 even though on an absolute scale its food might not be as good as that at a gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"Lotus was one of the most highly recommended places for me to try when I first moved here.  Driving eastbound down Sahara into a semi run down shopping center lowers your expectations immediately and makes you think \"Ok this place sorta looks like a dive, but I'm sure the food is awesome\".  Once you walk through however, it is surprising how classy and well put together this restaurant is!

I've been lucky and haven't had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table here, but i would suggest calling ahead to be safe.  The staff here is very professional and friendly and the feel is very authentic.

I always order the Pad Thai because I am very interested in how each place puts their spin on it.  Lotus of Siam has a very good Pad Thai but not the best I have ever had, so i can't warrant giving it a 5 star rating.

I will say that the menu is very expansive and the price point is great considering how well put together everything is inside and all the buzz going around town about it.

I find it as a safe place to take my friends since many have heard about the legend and the menu is flexible and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Above average Thai food at a significantly above average price.

Most of the Yelp reviews here have painted a pretty decent picture of the pretty decent food at the restaurant, but a lot of them fail to acknowledge the decently high price you have to pay for their most famous dishes; the garlic prawns and crispy duck dishes are all nearly 30 dollars. And for the portion size of the duck, it is certainly significantly overpriced.

The food itself is almost as good as it is hyped up to be on Yelp, and it is probably better than your local Thai place unless you happen to live somewhere in Thailand. The curries and sauces are flavorful, as most Thai places generally make them, and this restaurant offers quite a vast menu with many Northern Thai options you don't often see elsewhere. A lot of people recommend the crispy rice appetizer, but to each their own, since I thought it tasted like salty and sour crispy rice that tasted probably just as good as my description. I don't drink personally, but there is a large selection of wine here, too.

The price was a bit higher than your average Thai meal, and the portions aren't especially generous. The rice is served in small bowls and is probably the weakest link at this restaurant. I'd say this restaurant falls into the common Yelped up restaurant category, serving good food at a slightly excessive price. This place is a solid four star place that is worth a couple of visits, but a far cry from a five star location that would be a regular in my book."}
{"text":"When we have visitors, they always want to go here because for them it is a real treat! I don't disagree. The food is great! We are always happy to make this the spot to meet and visit!

Do I think it is the best Thai in the city, I have to be honest. No, I don't.

But they have some great dishes! Crispy Duck! YES!
The scallops are amazing! Noodle dishes are pretty great as well.

I know everyone is crazy about the Garlic Prawns. Our order was 25% shrimp and 75% fried shrimp shells. Which our waiter assured us were edible and delicious. Not a fan of them. Sorry. 

The service has always been A+ since we have been going. 
Words of wisdom- MAKE A RESERVATION!! The wait can be a hour+

No matter how you look, always fun to bring people to a place that has been on so many TV Shows, and frequented by both local and world celebs!"}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere, great food, and fast service. Nestled in one of the most random/creepy shopping centers in Vegas. We love it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch on our way back from hiking for the day.  I was slighly concerned by the location, but once inside it was no issue. The menu here is extensive and there is plenty to chooose from.  We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp for an appetizer. While this isnt' \"authentic Thai\", it was great.  I had the green curry chicken, which had great flavor and heat.  If I recall correclty, my wife ordered a cilantro tofu dish that was great. We would go again if back in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Lotus of Siam the initial impression is extraordinarily underwhelming. Lotus is located in an unassuming strip mall north of the strip a stone's throw from the SLS Hotel. Not only is the exterior somewhat dilapidated but the surrounding establishments are a bit questionable. Affordable Dental? The Foot Lounge? All that doubt fades away as you enter the restaurant, which is lively- filled with people of all walks of life amidst an undeniable waft of Thai chilies and spices. I must admit service was a bit lacking at first. From the hostess that walked us in to the waiter who took our drink order, there didn't seem to be much effort put into being attentive. But this didn't really bother me considering the sheer number of guests the restaurant was trying to attend to. Our waiter, on the other hand, was extremely friendly and helpful in choosing menu items that would suit our liking.

I decided to try their Thai Lime Drink that was made in house. The drink came to the table cloudy and mint blue in color. My immediate reaction was it was extremely crisp and refreshing. It wasn't too sweet with just enough zest for a puckering sensation. It was light, which paired well with the heavy flavors of Thai cuisine. 

For my entrée I ordered the Khao Soi: crispy duck over egg noodles with Northern Thai curry and wonton crisps. I ordered mine mild but traditionally it is eaten much spicier. Because the curry was light in spice the coconut milk had a very obvious presence. The curry itself was a bit watery unlike the thick Thai curries that I was used to. The egg noodles were mid-sized in width, cooked perfectly and paired well with the curry in that it wouldn't absorb too much of the flavor. The noodles were thin with a nice bite to them. I've noticed that the flavor of the protein in Thai curries usually takes a backseat and the textures of the meat are much more prominent. This dish was no different in that the duck had fantastic texture: it was cut in thick strips and the skin providing a satisfying crunch. Every couple of bites I would get a sprig of cilantro, which would cut the heaviness of the sauce or a wonton crisp with green onion that would add to the contrast of textures. 

Overall, I had a memorable experience at Lotus and it only further ascertained that I have a fervent passion for Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! 

We have tons of great Thai food where I'm from in Seattle, and I wish I could take this restaurant home with me. 

Best Pad Thai I've ever tasted. Not bland at all. We ordered extra to go! 

Huge wine selection. 

This place is hidden away in a dim lit strip mall, but as soon as you walk inside, you'll see it's packed. Make a reservation if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Visited in August during the week.  The place is in a strip mall so we took a cab from the strip.  It's clean and inviting.  The food though was just a-ok.  It was good but coming from Chicago where there is great Thai restaurants, this was comparable to a mediocre restaurant at home.  Price were reasonable and the wine list is pretty impressive."}
{"text":"This place is the Mecca for all Thai food ! I have been here twice and both times, my experience lived up to all the hype. Their Khao Soi has amazing complex flavors and is the perfect comfort food. Living in Nashville, it's impossible to find khao soi so my husband has very closely replicated this recipe but it's not the original. The staff is so helpful and friendly and their menu is expansive and full of amazing options. I can't say enough good things about Lotus of Siam. It's amazing in every way!"}
{"text":"Being a Concierge for over 14 years, I can count how many times they answer the phone. They are not courteous and friendly. They can only hold the reservation for 5 mins. The restaurant is very tiny. Its fire hazardous. Since they are very popular, they should extend their restaurant and have some kind of reservation agent for booking. This is such a task for us in the industry as well as for our guests."}
{"text":"I don't really see what the hype is all about. Yes, it's good but the way people rave about it. EH, I wouldn't wait hours on end to eat at this restaurant. When we called in today to see how long the wait would be or if we could make reservation, the girl said nothing was available till monday. WTH? We took our chance, walked in, and only waited 15 min. We ordered the Issan sausage, crispy duck w/mint, nam kao tod, and the tom kah kai. I felt like a lot of the food was overly salty, but maybe its just my taste pallet. Everything was okay, not super amazing."}
{"text":"Hands Down the best food in Las Vegas. Go when they first open,very busy every nite.The drunken shrimp is a must."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Lotus. Being there at 11 a.m. on a Friday was a good idea because at 11:10 there was a line up out the door. (It is inside the old Roy's restaurant which will be missed by many in Las Vegas including myself).
      The Lotus has two restaurants now, one in Commercial Center, which is still under reconstruction after its roof fell in. The second location on E Flamingo,  is far easier to get to , and safer from all of the menacing  people around the parking lot of Commercial Center. 
     The service was fantastic. The dinnerware was clean and the glassware a little smudgie so I had green tea; which tasted like a burnt rice style.
    I recommend ordering the bacon shrimp wrapped in rice paper as an appetizer. Who could go wrong with this? Picture attached of morsel.
 I also ordered the shrimp pad thai and was sparse of noodles that was unusual for any other Pad Thai I have had in Las Vegas. I have had this dish  before at their Commercial Center location and it had a lot more noodles over vegetables but the shrimp in the dish was plentiful. I also ordered the tofu chop suey which was delicious and the tofu had a nice crisp to the dish.
   It has been a couple of years since I've been to the Lotus of Siam in their Commercial Center location, and prices have gone up.  In the end good food. Stretch the dollar, and order one less dish!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service even during busy lunch, no lunch specials yet. Portions are quite small for the price. I prefer Weera Thai over this for the value."}
{"text":"Love this place and my yearly trip to Las Vegas always includes a stop at Lotus of Siam! The place is always packed! The food is awesome and so is the price!!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best Thai food around and definitely worth a trip off the strip.  It's a great place to grab lunch after a night out on the town.

Be warned, the menu is monstrous so a little research on yelp (which is what you're doing now obviously!) will help you get started.

Our party of four shared a few dishes including the spicy shrimp salad, tamarind beef, duck with curry sauce, and a spicy catfish dish.  You can choose your heat levels and we stuck with a 5/10 for our dishes which was all I could handle personally.

Everything was well prepared with higher quality ingredients than your typical Thai place.  It's nice to be able to have good quality Thai food that is authentic and not some fusion excuse to charge you more money.

We didn't try the buffet, but it looked ok.  I would definitely go with the menu and order what you want instead."}
{"text":"Dearly loved in the community and heaped upon with a mass of accolades, Lotus of Siam is fairly accessible if you are staying on the Strip, but is it worth it? Depends who you ask. I'd probably call it \"white people Thai food\" in a dated, old setting, and it's the only thing that keeps this strip mall alive.

Quite honestly, I'm not a fan of the food. It's expensive for Thai food, and our food didn't come out hot. Servers were nice but harried in passing. 

Chances are you have to wait to eat. Please note that they do take an afternoon rest and close shop after 2:30PM, I believe. As for me, next time I'd go down to Chinatown to find some incredible Thai food there that is cheaper and without a wait."}
{"text":"Ok...so I'm no longer on fire!  Holy crap was the food spicy.  Even some of the mild dishes were pretty hot!

I went to this restaurant with a rather large group of people, so we ordered many dishes.  We started with a fried won ton of some sort with pork and sweet and sour sauce.  It was probably my favorite dish of the night.  I probably could have eaten that dish the whole night.  After that came a coconut curry chicken soup, crispy noodles with shrimp and sweet and sour, pad Thai, crispy duck, steak tar tare and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  All good, although I would not order the steak tar tare again.  

Everything was very spicy.  I don't think that I have ever wanted to drink a glass of milk or had ice cream so bad in my life!  Unfortunately, the servers brought us the bill without offering us dessert.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place disproves the old \"location, location, location\" line.  Located in a seedy strip mall off E Sahara, these folks talk Thai,  very well.  The key to the menu here is prolificity, with close to 150 items capped off by a series of Chef's dishes and curries all of them fresh and interesting.  For me it was the Roast Duck Red Curry with pineapple and a dash of coconut milk, preceded by an amazing salad of crispy Soft shelled crab tossed with shaved cabbage, lime, peanuts and fresh chili (10/10).  But wait, there's more!  Wine list is crazy extensive for an ethnic joint.  Great German riesling selection, to be expected, but a surprising amount of Burgundy plus a ton of other old and new world juice.  When in Sin City don't forget to tell your cabby (sorry no tram) to hit the Village Square Commercial Center and check out my favorite place for a taste of Thai."}
{"text":"The Lotus is a hidden gem that some locals introduced us to - really, really yummy Thai food. It's location is refreshingly non flashy, the staff very friendly and the fact that it was completely booked on a Monday evening should tell you something. 

With a group of around a dozen people we just scratched the $200 mark - and that included starters, entrees and a healthy amount of beer. Escape the casino madness, people!"}
{"text":"I went with a reservation of 17 people. They were very accommodating, seeing how they are always booked to capacity. The food was great. The only issue we had with this place is that we didn't get our fish dishes. We ended up canceling it because it took too long, everything else had came out and we were already full. According to the waitstaff it was ok to cancel because they didn't start cooking it yet. What's up with that? Yes, I don't except everything to be perfect when you have a party of 17 but at least the fish should have started to be prepped or something. 
All and all good experience, food was great, service was great, will be back when in town."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after seeing it highlighted in an episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. In short, the restaurant definitely lives up to the hype.

Despite walking in on a Friday night without a reservation we were able to get a table with a relatively short wait of about 15 minutes. I absolutely love the wait system, Waitlist Me, that the restaurant employs. After giving my name and phone number, I received a text indicating my estimated wait time and a link to a website showing my spot in the wait queue. Granted, the wait time estimate was somewhat off as it was 45 minutes initially, but seeing your place in the wait queue gives you a good idea of the remaining wait. Moreover, when our table was ready I received a text with the option to confirm or request an extra 15 minutes (presumably if you decide to go elsewhere during a long estimated wait).

My girlfriend and I decided to grab some drinks at the bar while waiting. I was surprised that the place had such an extensive list of wines available (in addition to their also extensive sake selection). They seemed to specialize in German rieslings, so I ordered a glass. I was not disappointed.

We found the staff to be very friendly and attentive. They were constantly floating around and checking in to know if we needed anything. And luckily, as we were pressed for time to get to a concert, the food preparation was quick.

Based on a tip from the show, we stuck to the northern Thai specialties. We ordered three items: Khao Soi, Sai Oua, and Thum Ka Noon. The Khao Soi and Thum Ka Noon were the agreed upon favorites. They were both just oh so flavorful. My personal favorite was the Thum Ka Noon, but my girlfriend preferred the Khao Soi. The Sai Oua was also very tasty, but, possibly because it was somewhat spicy, didn't leave the same impression as the other dishes. I'm not really a fan of spicy dishes, but if you are, then I'd recommend it as well."}
{"text":"Just go! All the foodie reviews don't equal your own opinion. We've eaten here many times and rarely have anything to complain about. The servers are usually spot-on and let us know when we may be ordering something not as tasty. We love when the owner comes out to offer seasonal dishes of the night. Delicious!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place! My cousin brought me here when I was visiting Vegas from the east coast.  It's located in a quiet shopping center, I couldn't believe how busy the restaurant was until I stepped inside.   
So we got their famous garlic prawns - definitely remarkable, so flavorful and perfectly cooked, you can't get this anywhere else!   The crispy duck with penang curry was so good - the duck meat was tender with crispy skin in the flavorful penang sauce.   Pad thai was the best pad thai I've ever had.  
This place gets really busy even on week nights, make sure to call for reservation.
I wish I could have stayed in Vegas for longer and come back a few more times to try other dishes on their menu.  I'll definitely return when I come to Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive off the strip!  Our group of 7 have eaten there two years in a row and we let the waiter order for us both times.  Different entres each time and all were excellent!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't know by location that this is the best you can find in the region.  Their curries are complex and will suit any palate; 2 for me, 8 for dtr...everyone was thrilled including the vegetarians.  Reserve in advance or sneak in for lunch first come."}
{"text":"Yes it has a bazillion awards, yes Anthony Bordain, Max Jacobson, and tons of other food critics have said this is the place to go. Yes it really took me this long to try it. And yes, you can kick me for it! (as long as you bring some wings when you do). 
Ok, first, let me tell you the story of many years ago. My mom took me here for the lunch buffet. I stuck my nose up like, what the heck is my mom trying to get me to eat here. Well let's just say I made a recent call to my mom saying, \"I am so sorry I didn't like Thai food at a younger age, you were right\". I am sure she enjoyed that. 
I have yet to come here for dinner, and I have yet to try any of these specials that are frequently talked about. However, in the past two weeks, I have come here 3 times for lunch. I get my usual that I normally get when eating Thai food. Garlic & black pepper chicken, green beans and beef, basil fried rice, drunken noodles, or yellow curry. Just a few classic personal favs. I have plans on venturing into the Northern Thai portion of their menu. I recently had their wings as an appetizer. I brought back the three leftover wings to co-workers. Three out of three of them asked where those amazing sweet chili wings came from. I will win them over bringing leftovers from this place. 
Now, let's talk about spice! If you have read any of my reviews, you know I like SPICY!! It grinds my gears when I go to eat any place, they claim something is spicy, and it doesn't make me sweat. Don't tease me! I usually get anywhere from a level 6 to 8. In the past, Pan Asian has been the only place I have had to step back, wipe off the sweat, and shake the hand of the chef to thank them. Well, on my first experience here at LOS, I knew, I had found a place on my level. 
I ordered my pepper chicken at a level 7, and let's just say my Thai ice tea did not last over half my meal. From now on, I will stick with a level 5 or 6 here. Well done Lotus of Siam. There is a competitor in the parking lot, and their level 8 did not even make me turn red. (CUE WAMP WAMP MUSIC)
I will keep you updated as I try more authentic stuff on the menu. However, if your a white girl (or guy), who can handle spice, and loves Thai- GET HERE ASAP! Thank me later!"}
{"text":"There's nothing bad to say about lotus of Siam. The food is absolutely delicious. It's extremely busy, so if you're planning on going make sure you make reservations 3 days ahead of time. Best Thai food in all of Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat in Vegas. Authentic Thai food. A little off the main strip but worth the drive."}
{"text":"We went for the first time to try the infamous lunch buffet. The buffet was small, but everything on it tasted homemade and delicious. We eat at a lot of buffets, and normally the small ones end up being a waste. This was not! The service was a little slow, and it wasn't very crowded, so both of those things surprised us. The curry chicken they had on the buffet made up for most of it, and the most interesting and unique tasting hot and sour soup we have ever had. Each spoonful had a different and complex flavor. We tried to figure out what all was in it that wasn't obvious, but couldn't. We would like to come back and try ordering off the menu for dinner."}
{"text":"We went here and had the lunch buffet. For $10.99/person, the food was great and full of flavor. My favorite was the beef soup and red curry chicken...Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas, we have to eat here at least once!  There were no dinner spots available for reservations online so we decided to just come for lunch on the Friday we were in town.  We made it right before noon and was seated right away.  Yay!

We always get the garlic black pepper chicken wings for the appetizer.  It is so tasty and the chicken stays juicy.  Our daughters loved them.  

For our lunch entrees, we ordered the pad se-ew, Thai fried rice and yellow curry.  Everything tasted great.  The curry had just the right amount of spice to it (not burn your tongue off so you can't enjoy the food).  The portions are reasonable but if you love to eat, you should order an extra dish.  The 4 of us (2 adults, 2 little kids) almost finished all the food we ordered.  We had a bit of leftovers that we took back to the hotel.

Service was a bit slow but I guess they are just really busy.  It got packed pretty fast after we were seated.  Come early for lunch or else be prepared to wait a bit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big on Thai food and during a recent visit to Vegas we selected this restaurant based on the positive reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Authentic Thai spiced to the requested level.  This restaurant is difficult to find.  It does not front Sahara Avenue and there is no signage on Sahara to let you know where the restaurant is located.  It is in a small strip mall whose back side fronts Sahara.  Hard to find but well worth the effort."}
{"text":"All I have to say is get the DEEP FRIED GARLIC PRAWNS!!!!!!
They are AMAZING!!! I drool just thinking about them! The shells of the prawns is absolutely crisp beyond belief and the prawn itself is just delicious, all with garlic galore!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam comes highly recommended both by Yelp and my friends of mine who have been to Vegas. Since it's a bit far from the Strip, we put it on the calendar for lunch post our drive back to Vegas from the Grand Canyon. We had breakfast that morning at about 8am and then nothing for the next 5-6 hours, so we were starving! 

We arrived at about 1pm and were seated right away. I went with my standard Pad See Ew with chicken and it was delish! Cooked perfectly! The noodles were soft and bouncy, just the way I like them. 

My friend is originally from Thailand and he said he'd give them an 8/10, which is damn high praise since he thinks nothing in the US tastes as good as back home (He had also just spent Christmas back home). 

Service was attentive and they split our bill by four credit cards, which was a plus. I think I've mentioned how much I appreciate it when restaurants are willing to do this."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The best Thai food I've ever had. Period. Multiple flavors working in concert. Reasonable prices. Excellent service. Bizarre atmosphere. I almost didn't go in because the outside is such a dump. I thought I had the wrong address. We went in and it was hopping. Too bad I can't give six starts. Genuinely excellent."}
{"text":"CAUTION STAY AWAY,
I went to this place this past weekend.  After hearing all the hype about this place, and with so many great reviews me and my friends decided to give it a try. We got there at about 7:30 they told us it was about a 30 minute wait, which isn't bad for the weekend for dinner. So we waited, they called us  after 30 minutes, already knew what where gonna order. It took a while for someone to even take are order, So finally we got are order in about 15 minutes later. The first item that came out was the soup, the guy who was serving it only filled up half of the soup cups. I was wondering why is that? Its because there was barely any of the soup. I thought this would be just with the soup. So then we are waiting for the other food to come out this took a while, OTHER PEOPLE THAT CAME 15 MINUTES  AFTER US GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! So 30 minutes later the food comes and the portions are SO SMALL, IT WAS LIKE I ORDERED A LUNCH SPECIAL FOR MYSELF. I thought I was the only one thinking this but all my friends agreed with me. Then we asked the waiter are these normal portion sizes, he says yes. PLEASE NOTE ON ALL OTHER TABLES EVERYONE'S DISHES where way bigger, People where even taking food to go. IT SEEMED LIKE THEY DIDN'T LIKE US. So after all this we just decided to eat and deal with the mess we got into. As I AM GETTING A PIECE OF FISH OUT OF THE PLATE THEIR IS A PIECE OF HAIR IN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS IT I HAD It I DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THAT POINT. I AM NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN, HIGHLY OVERRATED DO NOT GO HERE!!
CAUTION STAY AWAY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE CAUTION STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"These days, thanks to sites like Yelp and television programs, restaurant hype is more prevalent than ever before.  Lotus of Siam has certainly benefited from positive coverage and word of mouth--just on my flight into Vegas, two groups seated next to me were talking about upcoming reservations.  But hype is a double-edged sword:  my expectations for my dinner were so high that nothing short of an unforgettable, \"I'll be talking about this years from now,\" kind of meal was going to be good enough.  Amazingly, Lotus of Siam met those expectations, and then some.

My extended family (party of 9) arrived at Lotus, and I immediately got ragged on--I am known for taking trips off the beaten path in pursuit of great meals, with mixed results, since most of my family generally favors \"meat and potatoes\" kind of establishments.  Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable.  Because we were warned that the restaurant does not hold reservations, we arrived 20 minutes early, and after a quick drink at the bar, we were seated.

Let's start with drinks--Lotus has all the standard beers and liquors you might expect at a Thai restaurant, but also has a very impressive (and appropriate) wine list, with great options at every price point.  This was a nice, unexpected touch.  Service was quick and friendly, as well.

As for the food, all I can say is that there was literally something for everyone:  the classics (Tom Kha, garlic prawns) that you can get at most Thai restaurants were made at a higher level.  There were outstanding vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat.  Some of the Northern Thai dishes were things I'd never seen before, and everything we tried (in particular, a green chili pepper dish) was a hit.  The curries were also universally delicious, and for those of you who like spice, rest assured that Lotus isn't afraid of adding real heat.  My brother joked that the menu was like the Cheescake Factory if it was good, and this is actually a pretty good analogy; it takes time to read through the encyclopedic menu and figure out what you're going to order, but at the end of the day, everything we chose was either very good or excellent.

This was an incredible meal, and I will never make a trip to Vegas without stopping by."}
{"text":"It is very trendy and you often have to wait for a table.  But it is in Commercial Center (not a good location as far as safety).  The food is excellent.  The ambiance, not so much."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people love this place so much. Food was alright for the high price--nothing really special. Got the pork curry, garlic wings, and another dish with green beans and chicken. All were okay. Servers moved quickly, though food took about 15 min to reach the table. We were seated quickly as a party of 2 at 11:40am. Other than that, that's all I have."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Totally unexpected. Gets busy though, so make sure to make a reservation! Just FYI, it's in a little plaza just off the strip with plenty of parking.

I was able to indulge in the following gastronomic pleasures (in order of favorite to least fave, but they were all pretty dang good)--roasted duck with some kind of red curry, garlic prawns, Chilean sea bass (steamed) with ginger, tom yum kkoong and the drunken noodles. 

The roasted duck had a crispy skin and the curry was awesome!! Would def recommend this. Garlic prawns were also amazing. It's cut in half, with the meat curling out, but you can eat the rest of it as well (the shell). Deep fried, so it tastes like some kind of shrimp crackers. Dry (no sauce) but the flavor is bomb.

The ginger Chilean sea bass was cooked really well, but the sauce was a little lacking. Nothing special :/ The tom yum soup can get pretty spicy, so if you can't handle spicy too well, I wouldn't recommend more than a 5/10 haha. 

Service was also not too bad considering they seemed a little understaffed when I was there. Side note.. workers in white clothes aren't waiters, they just help with cleaning and serving.

All in all, great food at a great price!! Highly recommend trying this place, if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Best Thai is LV! Authentic dishes, highly recommend anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I always come back here every time I go to Vegas.  Had I was writing this review 3 years ago, it would have been a 5 stars.  

However, I am disappointed this time around.  The charbroiled shrimp with chili is still good, but the fried rice, the hot and sour soup with sea bass was not very good. The fish was not tender like before.   The sticky rice and mango was too soggy this time.  I had plan to eat here twice this time and my wife talked about it for the last 3 years she wants to go back to this place to eat.  However, the food disappoints.  I didn't believe my brother, who lives in Vegas; he said that  it is not the same as before."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on our way out of Vegas.  I've been waiting forever to check this place off my restaurant bucket list.  The menu is insane.  The reason it is insane is because there are so many damn options to choose from. The menu is like a novel.  It has 200 plus options.  If I lived near by I would go here all the time so I could try something different each time. We started with the spicy chicken wings.  To be honest they were good but not amazing or anything.  They definitely were more sweet than spicy.  I prefer more heat and less sweet. For my entrée I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass on drunken noodle.  The highlight of the meal was for sure the fish.  Oh my flippin god it was cooked perfectly. It was some of the best fish I have had in my life.  The flavors were great but the noodles stuck together which made it kind of difficult to eat.  I felt like I needed a knife to cut up the noodles.  It also was a little oily but that FISH!!!!  I can't wait to get back and try some more."}
{"text":"Went back a second time the night before Thanksgiving.  Continues to provide a wonderful experience for your taste buds.  Order the northern cuisine people!  Every trip to Vegas will include a trip to LoS for us."}
{"text":"Got the garlic prawn, khao soi (crispy duck), tom yum Bangkok style, sea bass with sweet chili, green curry, drunken noodles. Also had to get mango sticky rice!

FYI: I think the spicy sea bass is better than the ginger sea bass. The ginger sea bass doesn't quite have as much flavor as the spicy one. Spicy one has some sticky sauce too that goes really well.

Sea bass was really on point. Such juicy pieces cooked to perfection. Garlic prawns, nice and deep fried (which makes it so easy to eat the head). The tom yum soup tbh was the only one that was a miss for me. But even as a miss, this was still tasty (just wouldn't order this as there are so many other good options). The duck was also amazing, skin was the best part (similar to peking duck in that aspect). The curry was nothing special and just good. The drunken noodles were nice in that it adds more carbs and makes it more filling. Mango sticky rice, just as how you'd expect it. Nothing more needs to be said there.

I think that you do have to order a decent amount to be full here and it's not very cheap for thai food. Expect to spend about $40 here (worth!!)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night and it was completely packed and I see why. The service and ambience here were pretty nice. The food here was absolutely delicious and there was a huge selection. The food wasn't super oily or salty, which I really like. The thai iced tea was absolutely amazing. The price was pretty affordable. I would recommend this place to a friend and I would come here if I ever got the chance too."}
{"text":"Unsanitary and terrible!!! I ordered take out and the food took more than 30 minutes and wasn't hot!! Spent $50+ dollars just to find a green plastic piece IN MY FOOD!!! Looked like it was from some type of bottle. It blended in so well with the green peppers that I accidentally almost ate it!! I choked on it and had to spit it out!!! By the time this was discovered in our hotel room the restaurant was closed. Don't recommend!!! Very upset."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand the hype. Food was quite average. We had the Panang short ribs.  Not sure what meat that was but it's not short ribs I am used to. Pad kee mao was meh. We sat in some weird overflow room which made us feel like we weren't that important. Service was ok.

Top 5 Thai restaurant in the US?! C'mon on now?"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight and I was satisfied. I had a curry with egg noodle and it was yummy! The chicken satay was fine (nothing better than I had elsewhere), but I would go back the curry was delicious. Some people say this place is overrated, however the food here is yummy. I wish the restaurant was in a nicer location though, the commercial center is not that nice of an area."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the service.  When my husband called for reservation, he was told no reservation.  When we arrived, I saw hostess on the phone taking reservation, and they have a reservation book.  Make me to leave right away."}
{"text":"I did my research on this place and did the whole only order from the back side of the menu with all of the northern specialties. And holy moly. Those garlic prawns were AMAZING. I forever will need them in my life and have been ruined for all other crispy, garlicky, Heaven infused crustaceans. The crispy duck with curry was also a favorite, I could eat that daily. I'm so coming back here everytime I'm in vegas. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Sunday night we made a stop at our favorite Thai restaurant anywhere.  It was just two of us, usually we are in a group of 4 to 6.  We had the chicken satay and shrimp wrapped in bacon and wonton.  The satay was good and the shrimp was really good. It was fried and perfectly lightly crunchy.  Next we had the sea bass and the scallops.  The sea bass was to die for and so were the scallops.  Usually we just say \"bring two or three appetizers and two or three main dishes\" and we are always quite happy with the selections.  The new location is quite a bit more upscale and was fun.  Reservations are recommended as they are always busy."}
{"text":"After Lotus of Siam blew up from Bourdain's visit, it just doesn't seem to cut it like it used to, and I've been here before the hype and after, like when it was difficult to get a cab to pick you up after that glorious meal. 

While they still kill it with their northern menu dishes, I feel like the prices have spiked and the servings have shrunk the last 1-2 years. This is a shame because the flavor is still there. 

I wish they wouldn't skimp out on the servings like the crispy duck dishes or would add more noodles to the noodle dishes. I feel like they are just mass producing since they are turning tables constantly throughout the night. 

Overall I would come again but only if making a reservation is easy. Not worth it to do a walk-in, which will cost you 60-75 minutes of time waiting."}
{"text":"I guess maybe my expectations were too high? Perhaps I was too hyped on all the hype. The only things I found to be impressive were the service and the wine. We ordered a bottle of burgundy style Pinot noir that was heavenly. We arrived on time for out reservation and were seated and greeted promptly. *Be on time or they will give your table away if you're later than five min*. 

The wine list... Insane. Pages and pages of wine... Unbelievable. I definitely would recommend ordering a bottle, considering the price per glass. Once you taste the food, you will definitely understand why. 

The service was wonderful. We never ran out of water and there was someone constantly checking on us. I love that. 

The ambiance... Way way way too bright. I felt like I was in a hospital. The lights... Just too much. No table decor. No candles. Paper placemats. The decor was really dated. And considering their extensive wine list, I was expecting more umph. But it was okay. 

The food... Left so much to be desired. We had a jack fruit vegetable curry. It was more like overly spiced watery vegetable soup. We usually order a 7 or 8 in spice. We love heat. The 7 was almost un edible. Beware. The curry wasn't sweet at all... Just really really watery and hot. I'm not use to this style of Thai and obviously not a fan. The rice... It was good, but they gave one small bowl for the four of us. We order three meals. (Our friends were not impressed either). The price of the food is fitting for the ambiance. Will I return? Maybe for a birthday, but never on my own. We will stick to komol (same shopping center). They have the style of Thai I prefer apparently... And their food is just... It's so good. 

Give this place a shot and form
Your own judgments though. Happy yelping."}
{"text":"Fried bacon wrapped prawns.
Green curry chicken.
Coconut ice cream.
Protip: Call the cab to bring you back as soon as you get dessert. It will take them a while to arrive and you don't want to sit there like a jerk waiting 15 minutes after you've already paid your bill.
You are welcome."}
{"text":"1 star is a bit generous here..

First off, if you're from out of town, you might get lost trying to locate this place.  The GPS dings but where the hell is it?!  After circulating the street for a while...AHAA there it is!!  It's located right behind the main street in a sketchy strip mall.  It would have helped if they light up their sign on the big street or cut down the tree blocking it (I say fix the freakin' sign).  But no worries, this place has no shortage of patrons.  There was a long line even on a weeknight.  We waited close to an hour.  Normally I would not wait to eat this kind of food but I was with family and one of them was craving Thai.  During our wait there was a car getting broken into.  Wait, did I already say the location is sketchy?

SERVICE:  Bad.  We asked for extra spoons that never came.  The food took 30 minutes to come out.  While fuming, I saw two ladies who got seated way after us getting their food first.  And they actually had the audacity to tip themselves 18%!

FOOD:  mediocre at best!  We had the usual pad Thai, pad see ew, rad na, Thai fried rice, etc., and there was nothing special to write home about.  And the portions are tiny!  Growing up in southern CA where there's no shortage of Thai restaurants, I'm use to leftovers.  We left hungry because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to order extra.  And oh yeah, it's expensive.  Not worth it and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After watching the episode of Anthony Bourdain's visit to Lotus of Siam, I was completely psyched about finally experiencing the restaurant for myself first hand. We were lucky enough to walk into the restaurant at 6:00pm on a Friday night as a group of three with no reservations and get seated immediately.

After perusing through over a 150 choices, I ultimately decided to start off with the Bangkok style tom kha kai and a Thai iced tea. I typically order this soup at every Thai restaurant that I attend, not only because it is a guilty pleasure of mine, but also because it serves as an excellent baseline comparison. With that being said, I was certainly disappointed with this dish. Obviously lime is a crucial element of tom kha kai, but this level of lime was excruciatingly overpowering, so much so that the lime was entirely the focus of the dish. The decision to use button mushrooms in the soup, instead of straw mushrooms also bothered me since button mushrooms are almost as substandard as shiitakes. 

Anyways, after finishing the tom kha kai I ignored the formation of any previous negative judgements, and ordered the chef's choice: the crispy duck with panang. The duck was placed atop the curry in a strategic effort to maintain the crispness of the skin, and it did just that. The duck was decadent, however, the panang was actually the highlight of the dish: spicy, creamy, well-balanced and delicious with both the rice and duck.

Ultimately, I highly recommend skipping the tom kha kai as I am sure that there are much better starters on the menu. As others have stated, please don't even bother to order the pad thai, there is seriously no excuse. Although I've notice some complaints from other Yelpers, the crispy duck with panang was worth the high price point. The dish fortunately provided a much needed redemption from the letdown of the tom kha kai. I'll certainly visit again to order more Northern dishes."}
{"text":"Have heard really good compliments about this place from several people, I recommend putting your name on the reservation list as this place gets really busy. 
The place is not in a good area, but the restaurant is really big and the whole restaurant is full at 8pm on Friday night.

We ordered pork larb, sea food tom yam prung shrimp, some beef dish #55, soft shell crab drunken noodle and duck curry for three people. It was a lot of food.  My only comment is the food can be hotter when it came out, almost felt like they were sitting out on the counter for a while before it was delivered to us. 

I also clearly stated I wanted duck curry, and was charged the crispy duck pannang, I honestly had no idea they brought up the wrong order , I ate it , it was duck and curry.. but when the check came up it was extra $20 than I expected .

I do appreciate the waiter comping our mango sticky rice dessert because of it, and also say the crispy duck pannang was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant iv ate in my life ...."}
{"text":"Outstanding Fried Tofu, lovely warm curries, a yummy scallop entree, on and on.  Never had something here that I didn't like.  I usually go with a group of friends and literally everyone has always enjoyed their food here and some of them have a pretty high 'bar' of expectations.    Service is always spot on and they have nice wine choices as well."}

Moo young:  good.

Chilean sea bass with ginger:  flaky and boneless.  Got it over a bed of veggies 

Crispy duck on drunken noodle:  good crispy flavor, also no bones.  Drunken noodles good.

Panang curry with chicken: another good choice."}
{"text":"Lol this place is outrageously expensive for Thai food. But that being said it's pretty spot on of what real Thai food should taste like. They make this for the farangs"}
{"text":"totally great food and service, reasonable prices,   new location, and it's always a treat to go there!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a real hole in the wall with amazing, just amazing food!!! I've had Thai food here and there but this is the first time I appreciated it. You pull up to this unassuming restaurant. Not the best location and the entrance was small and tight with signed photos of famous celebrities hung behind the cashiers  post. As we were led to the dining area, I was in shock, the place was huge, packed with diners, a glass showcase of wine bottles displayed against a wall. We ordered stuffed fried chicken, Masuman curry, fried rice, pad thai, fried wantons. There were a few dishes we had to take a vote, otherwise we'd order them all and we know we can't eat them all. Every dish was delicious!!! The pad Thai stood out as the best I've had!!!
Service was good and everyone was friendly.
I can't wait to go back!!! A good dining experience."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since I saw it on Munchies. I'm so glad I did. Though it's location is far from where I live, I feel like it's worth the drive and wait to go there. Trust me, I waited a year because i thought it would be so expensive. The prices were exceptional.

We didn't have reservations but we were quickly seated. Our server was very attentive. I never had to ask a single time for my drink to be refilled. Most restaurants have trouble with that on a busy night.

Our appetizer was wonton bacon wrapped shrimp. I wanted to try it so bad that my husband and I took one each before I took a picture.

We ordered thier Tom yum catfish hotpot. We ordered it mild because I can't really take alot of spicy food. It was just the perfect amount of spicy.  

We also ordered pad Thai and penang curry duck. The serving for each dish was enough for 2 people to share. It's either that or we just really eat alot."}
{"text":"You don't even know this place exists...but then when you finally find the door...a world of flavor finds you.

I'm a Thai snob and this fit the bill just fine. The curries were a tiny bit more \"saucy\" and wet than I'm used to, but flavor was on point.

This spot definitely book marked.

{"text":"My husband had done research on this restaurant before going and thank goodness. The menu is intense. I don't know if I would have known where to begin. We started with the stuffed wings; which are not your average wings. They tasted like a meat egg roll. Also, we shared the crispy duck, B option, and the garlic prawns. Delicious. The service was incredible. Are reservations, which are encouraged, were at 5:30 and they literally open the doors right at that time. However, when you walk in the whole staff is waiting at the entrance as if you've been invited to someone's house for dinner. We got thai teas to go and they were perfect for the drive home."}
{"text":"Eating here was a much anticipated event for us, and were were sad to be as disappointed as we were with the food.  Sticking to the Northern dishes as advised, we ordered the Northern Larb, Kang Ka Noon, and the Nam Prik Hed.  We had one diner with us who was not used to spicy food so we ordered everything mild.  Generally speaking, all of the dishes were not very well balanced in seasoning and far too spicy to call \"mild\" by any stretch.  I'm a pretty hardcore capsaicin junkie, and even I found the Kang Ka Noon almost impalatable. Other than the heat it was watery and otherwise flavorless.  The larb was OK, and the mushroom dip was also bland, aside from the chili.  All of the food came out incredibly quick, which suggested to us that they were preparing dishes before they were ordered to accommodate their success?  We left wondering if they simply couldn't keep up with the increased volume of clientele.  Regardless, we don't feel motivated to assume it was an isolated bit of bad luck and try them again.  Too much bad in one experience."}
{"text":"Food was really delicious. We had 7 people. Ordered 4 appetizers and 6 entrees. We made a reservation beforehand, which is highly recommended. 

We got the drunken noodles with soft shell crab, butterfly shrimp, a bunch of curries, and dumplings. The soft shell crab was good but not amazing. Same with the butterfly shrimp. Dumplings were delicious as were the curries. Their spiciness scale is off. We got 2/10 spiciness and it was quite spicy. 

This place is off the strip so if you have a car and want something relatively affordable it's worth checking out. It's pretty expensive for Thai food though."}
{"text":"went for dinner with 7 people tonight. the place was like a complete circus.
it was very noisy, the waitstaff were rude and unfriendly and it seemed as

Be reheated and interestingly enough they threw the18  percent tip on at the

So great because of prior ratings. I definitely would not waste my time and money.


Very disappointing........"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, tonight, with a friend. In a word, awesome! Had the number 55, which was beef and I think Cilantro and some other stuff I can't remember, but it was amazing. Had the yellow curry with chicken as well, both dishes done to a number 2 out of 10 heat level. I'd been told they really crank up the heat and so we went for a low number. Turns out I could have gone up several notches with that, but even at level 2 there was definitely some spice and flavor. 

Anyway, great food, friendly and prompt service, and I will absolutely be going there again."}
{"text":"The food is always great. It is ridiculous that you have to wait 1hour on a to-go order.

Since on Flamingo the to-go portion of the business went down hill."}
{"text":"1.5 hours of waiting if you don't RSVP. This was on a Monday night too. Luckily the fiance RSVP'd and we scurried past everyone.

The area its located in seems sketchy. It's like the scene of a drug deal in a movie outside a billiards bar. With everything looking closed, I wasn't even sure the restaurant was open if it wasn't for a few anonymous black jacketed patrons hanging outside of their door. As soon as I parked and got out of the car, I got hit up by a random stranger on a bicycle if he can clean my car for money. I said no thanks and rushed my family to the restaurant.

It gets better inside after seeing warmth and kind faces. At first glance the restaurant looks rather confined, like a San Francisco or New York restaurant that struggles with optimizing its square footage. Little did I know, there's a backroom and getting there felt like the infamous Goodfellas scene, walking through corridors and into a whole other adventure.

Food wise I ordered the house special fried rice, the tom kha gai, chop suey, and the garlic prawns based on other yelpers' thoughts.

All money. For sure the Garlic Prawns is a must. For me I loved the house special friend rice a lot because they did tomato fried rice with justice. It's surprisingly on the oily side so not everyone in my family enjoyed it like I did. Chop suey was also done right and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it over any other restaurant's. 

Other yelpers noted the dirty dishes. My experience was no exception as I had to ask for a new clean plate.

Damage was around $60. Good for a date and food for the family every now and then but too rich for my blood."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in North America, eh?  That's a tremendous reputation to live up to and unfortunately I think Lotus of Siam falls just a bit short.  I prefer the Thai Food in Los Angeles just a bit more.  However, Lotus IS pretty damn good and a must try during your next trip to Vegas.

They offer a lunch buffet, but I think you have to order off the menu if you want the good stuff.  The Chef Specials are a little pricy but are also what make Lotus so special.  I highly recommend the:

-GARLIC PRAWNS ($21.95)
More of an appetizer, but these whole prawns are fried until crispy and have great garlicky salty flavor.  You can eat the shell!

-KHAO SOI SHORT RIBS (19.95)
Very tender short ribs served over noodles in a very addictive Panang (I think it's Panang) sauce.  The sauce tastes amazing over rice as well.

-DRUNKEN NOODLES with CRIPSY DUCK (21.95).
My friends thought the duck was a little too spicy, but I thought it was very good.  The crispy skin reminds me of Peking duck.  I wasn't that impressed by the noodles though.

Service was very friendly but also very slow, especially after we got our food.  We didn't see our waiter again until we had to flag him down to get our check.  It then took 10 minutes for him to get it and another 15 for us to pay.  In his defense though, the place was PACKED during lunchtime on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Everything was flipping amazing, the egg roll, the thai chicken wings, the druken noodle which when i asked for it, was hotter than the sun. love this place"}
{"text":"I have been here 7 times and each time has been an amazing experience. 

Today however was not so great. 

I brought 3 co workers in for dinner after work and was so excited to have them experience the awesomeness that is Lotus of Siam. 

The bar tender had me try a drink that she said was similar to sparkling blueberry sake. It wasnt. It was like lemoncello. It was good so I offered to buy my co workers each a glass of it. The bar tender told me to buy the bottle and said its a good deal. It was $70.00. She didnt even tell me ahead of time. This wasnt a huge deal because I did like the taste a lot.

Then I ordered Nan Mao Tod and asked for it to not be Spivey. It came out with 4 Thai chili's in what equaled about 2 cups of rice. Crazy spicey. When I mentioned it to the waiter he didnt react at all other than to walk away.   This wasnt right as my mouth was on fire. I order this dish everytime by the way and its the main reason I come here. Couldn't even eat it.

I also order the rad Nah. It was good but very few noodles and mostly gravy. 

The pad see we was delicious though. Highly recommend it. 

Once we finished our food. We were finishing our drinks and our waiter asked us to hurry up and leave so he could have our table. It was between 5 and 10 minutes. I dont find this to be an excessive amount of time."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The garlic prawns are worth the price & a staple order every time we go. We also love the yellow curry with shrimp or chicken. We haven't had anything we didn't like. Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. Truly exceptional - tried the Tom Yum Koong soup (level 6 out of 10)- heavenly. I would come back for the soup alone. We also had the garlic prawn (recommend 100%) chicken pad Thai, chicken fried rice (best I ever had) chili basil ground chicken (definitely recommend), garlic wings and a strip steak. My boyfriend swears by the Thai iced tea but I'm more of a regular iced tea girl and both were great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Came here at 12:30 for lunch and was seated quickly. The place is low key in a swinging shopping center (**rimshot**), quiet and rather large inside. Tip: do NOT do the lunch buffet. Sure there are 20 items, but one walk past it and you can tell it's not of the highest quality. Why spend $10 on 5-6 mediocre dishes when you can drop $10 and get a fresh dish that's sure to fill you up. 

Here was the order:
Crispy duck curry - Curry is super creamy and delicious and the duck is crispy on the outside, while moist and flavorful throughout. A great dish. The problem? $24. I don't think I'd go down that road again. 

Khao Soi Beef- awesome little noodle dish. On spice level 7, it was hot enough to make me sweat a bit, but doesn't overwhelm. The noodles were long, the beef was tender and the curry was light, but packed a punch. A great combo. 

Egg rolls-
Eh. 

Def good eats to be had here. The menu has 150 items, so you're sure to find something to match your tastes. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The very best this food anywhere! I live in California and I go to this resturant on every trip to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the area, first of all but I had heard really good things about this place so I tried it. It was good. Busy with average service. I found most of the food pretty good (4 stars) but the higher price and smaller portions make this only 3 stars for me. One of my favorite dishes when I eat Thai food is the Beef Salad. Although theirs was very good, it was nothing like I expected, and not what I wanted."}
{"text":"Party of nine co-workers sat down for lunch on March 23, 2012.   I ordered #65 the whole catfish with vegetables.   The server asked what level of spicy from 1 to 10.  I chose 10 then changed it to a 9.   It was spicy and delicious $35.00 and $44 after tip and tax.  

Co-workers ordered the drunk fried shrimp and drunk chicken and noodles; both looked amazing.      Other orders were the pad thai, chicken satay and chow mein.  Everyone cleared their plates, however the plates did not look out of the ordinary.  

The food came out at different times.   So, we did not all start or finish at the same time.   The waiter added an 18% tip for the whole table and then took about 30 minutes to collect credit cards and cash on three separate visits. 

This is not an elegant restaurant.  The strip-mall is the perfect scene for the show Cops.   Bad boys, bad boys... what you gonna do when they come for you ...?

Overall my catfish was outstanding; this is the reason for the four stars."}
{"text":"I have been here 2x's for lunch. The restaurant location / shopping center appears to be a bit dodgey but the food is consistent, service excellent and fairly priced. Not a tourist trap and great food."}
{"text":"Nice food! So so service... Wish they would do a better remodeling of this place... But it has that authentic feel..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Went with a friend who loves it here. It was busy but seated quick and had good service. Food was get good and flavorful. I will be back again and add more detail. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We were saddened tonight, when we headed out to take my father out for some Thai cuisine (which he has never eaten before) at our favorite restaurant (Komol) that they had closed for a large dinner party..... :( :( :( So since we were already in the plaza, figured we'd give Lotus a try (we really have been meaning to eat here, but why venture away from great stuff if they are open!) (sorry Lotus, not knocking you down at all here, but hard to venture away from your local spot once you get comfy!)

Ok, inside, I will say - it is very brightly lit up with multiple chandeliers all over the ceiling. Decor wise, just about every wall space is filled with some group's photo & the owner of the restaurant somewhere. Not really sure what that is about. I know the owner of the restaurant was featured in a chef competition that had aired recently (can't even remember which one to be honest) on Food Network.

Moving on - crab cake appetizer, steamed mussels, crispy duck with chili mint sauce, crab fried rice, and rad na with beef. Crab cake appetizer - took me by surprise as the texture seemed to be more sponge like compared to the european crab cake version. Very tasty, but like I say - just a bit surprised from the texture. Steamed mussels - oh yeah a big hit! We were taken aback by the size of the mussels as they were quite large, but still very tasty! And oh baby does that sauce have some KICK! Not enough to have the fire department putting it out, but a good 'Woah what was THAT?!!!\" sensation. Crispy duck - yup sure was crispy! Meat was very tender though, and the chili mint that accompanies this dish is very refreshing. You can alter your spice level, and if it was a bit hotter would probably be better, but for the heat sensitive you still have a hint of the heat. Crab fried rice - nothing really fancy about this dish it is as it says fried rice with crab in it! Only thing about this dish to say would be to chunk up the crab meat a little more instead of having long leg chunks mixed in, to get a better ratio of crab to rice chunks. And then there is the rad na noodles with beef. The dish came out wallowing in a pot of brown gravy. And I will admit, I was disappointed at the lack of noodles in the mix. We barely had enough to go on 3 plates for the adults and 1 toddler. Plenty of beef was served up mind you, but would have preferred a bit more noodle. And the gravy, well didn't really stand out to my tongue palate - just ok.

Would I eat here again? Maybe to be honest. Personally I find Komol a bit better in the taste department, but I haven't had all the specialties here at Lotus - so I can't really say. But based on what I have experienced - some dishes are WOW, and others are 'eh'.

Service wise - it was busy tonight, and the staff was rushed and you could tell. The front door had a sign up asking customers to expect a 1 hr. wait for their food due to a large group being in the restaurant. We were lucky to get in beforehand, so our service was quick - but you could sense the staff was a little on edge. Our server was friendly and polite enough, but I know they were scrambling to stay on top of the large group. Anyways - that's my word for here. Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam recommends folks make reservations for dinner, and I couldn't agree more. The place gets a healthy crowd, so reserve as soon as you decide to go. Dress is casual, though I saw a table of women ready to go clubbing all glammed up.

Their unassuming interior won't \"wow\" you (but you may notice the strong smell of Thai spices permeating the dining room). While you may not be shocked by the decor, the food WILL grab your attention. All of our appetizers and entrees were tasty and of a consistent quality. If we requested our dishes to be spicy, they came out spicy.

Shared many dishes (which explains why I don't have much detail for some of them) and dined family style:
- koong sarong (prawn in a blanket; $11) - wish we had more!
- moo dad deaw (deep fried marinated pork jerky; $8) - yum
- mussels - spicy and scrumptious
- salad with ginger, ground beef ($8) - I think it was the tod mun plar
- sour soup (served in its own cooker) (probably more than $10)
- calamari salad (not bad!)
- green curry (tasty, not overtly spicy)
- something that looked like an omelette
- a noodle dish that was drunken noodle-esque

Lotus of Siam was recommended by many folks, local and otherwise. They aren't the best Thai restaurant in the US, as claimed, but it sure comes close. If you can live with average service (our first waitress seemed a little curt, but the rest were fine) and focus on their outstanding food, you'll find yourself a winner!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place forever and finally had the opportunity during my last trip to Vegas. We went on a weekday for lunch and it was not packed at all. Service was quick and efficient. We tried the popular dishes that everyone was raving about the crispy duck in panang curry and the garlic prawns. Yea definitely must try dishes. There were 3 of us. Would love to come back to try a variety of their dishes with a larger party. 

It's off the strip but a quick taxi ride away. It's located at a random strip mall and is easy to miss. But well worth the trip. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just simply great! Everything was great food/service. If you do not know your way around here you may get lost. Lotus location faces the opposite direction of the street. Good thing this place is famous and the Taxis and Uber drivers know of it."}
{"text":"There's usually two schools of thoughts for Lotus.

Most tourists enjoy it and are sold by the consistent TV plugs from Food Network and other social media.  If you talk to some locals, they'll talk about how overrated the food is.

I'm definitely a fan of Lotus but encourage you to branch out and order mainly from the Northern Thai section which is what separates this place from anywhere else.  

However the menu is like Cheesecake Factory with way to many selections which can be intimidating.  They should maybe provide pictures which would definitely help some of the novice Thai eaters.

Stay away from the ordinary Pad Thai, Satay's and Curries and opt with the new selections because that's why Lotus shines.

They also have a very pedestrian ABC Thai lunch special which is decent for what it is."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get it. After a $15 cab ride from our hotel, we arrived in one of the sketchiest strip malls that I have ever seen. -2 gay bath houses and a swing club. 
When our food came out, it didn't  all come at once, 4 of 5 entrees arrived, while the fifth member of our party had to wait. Over all, I would have to say that I was underwhelmed. I refuse to give an outstanding rating when it is unwarranted. I would call the food mediocre, I've had better, and I've had worse. There was nothing that stood out about the experience. 
Lastly, I noted the cab right to the restaurant, but it is worth noting that we had to wait outside, in the sketchy shopping center for about 30 minutes to get a taxi to take us back to our hotel."}
{"text":"I'd like to acknowledge that this family-restaurant have been in this town for a long time and helped turn this area around. There are new businesses popping up in this area because of them. They are a landmark and have a lot of famous patrons and friends on the walls.

This place would be great to come with a big family/group of friends, but you'll need a reservation far in advanced. This food is meant to be shared.

The food was just good/average. We ordered the famous duck dish for $28. It was good. The duck was fried perfectly. My husband ordered it 5 out of 10 spicy and I think because of the coconut curry sauce, it should have been much spicier. 

We were worried to order it spicy because back east a 5/10 spicy level is serious business at a few of our local restaurants. This was too mild. This dish would have been more balanced spicier.

I'm more a veggie-lover. So I ordered a broth curry with veggies and it was also too mild, I ordered it 6/10.

I would recommend to come in large groups so you can try more dishes and order things a little spicier."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Anhdao and I am a Thai food-addict.  The habit started nine years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles and a drive to Thai town was only 10 minutes.  I cannot go more than a couple of days without getting Thai.  Any longer than that and symptoms such as sleeplessness, lack in work diligence, and even unnecessary irritation will begin.

Lotus of Siam is the Holy Grail for any Thai food addict.  It is the only Thai place outside of the native country and accepts credit cards that claims legions of Thai foodie fans, myself included.  I don't know if the legends are true about the former chef who cooked for Thai royalty.  Legends in this town often spread like wild fire, without true origins.  But Lotus of Siam is not a lie, because the food does not lie.

If you are a undiscriminating Thai food-eater, I don't recommend this place, especially if you've heard too much of its reputation.  Lotus of Siam's pad thai or curries do not taste that differently from Archi's or Pin Kaow, and you're guaranteed to pay more here.  But if you are missing those Bangkok street vendors and want a taste of Thailand in North America, this is where you go.

Here are some adventurous (but not risky) authentic Thai dishes to try at Lotus:

1.  Yum Tale (combination seafood salad): the seafood tastes as if Vegas was a beach town; for the price, I venture to say they don't fly in the seafood daily.  But the marinade and dressing highlight the best in what they have.

2.  Plar Dook O Cha (whole deep-fried cat fish): a traditional Thai classic that is a must-try here.  Although the whole fish (fins, head, eyes and all) may look foreign at first to non-Thai eaters; the crispy-on-the-outside and buttery-soft-on-the-inside is something catfish filets will never entirely own.  Lotus's lime juice & peanut/cashew topping is as good as it gets.

3.  A Nua Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky Issan Style): deep-fried jerky that is salty and savory, perfect to pair with sticky rice and any of their salad.  Many restaurants outside of Thailand don't offer this, including all other Thai restaurants in Vegas.

4.  Khao Soi Braised Short Rib: Khao Soi is a type of Burmese-influenced Northern Thai egg noodles served in curry sauce and coconut cream.  You can order it with chicken or pork also.  But the short ribs are divine.  A very authentic dish that doesn't taste too foreign.

There are restaurants that are one-time affairs, restaurants that are seasonal flings, and restaurants that are long-term relationships.  Lotus of Siam is a relationship for me.  And one that I plan to document on Yelp as I write more updates about this favorite."}
{"text":"Memorable thai that was worth the fast-moving line. If you have no reservations, get there when it opens. Delicious."}

but other then that 5 starts"}
{"text":"Wow.  This was definitely worth the trip off: the strip.  Located on Sahara Ave in a part of town I would not otherwise have known to visit but for hearing great things about this place from various sources, including a fellow diner at Kabuto's.  

We got here at 8:45pm and was seated in 15 minutes.  Three dishes were ordered.

Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.  A good balance of sweet, sour, spicy, and salt, along with the fragrant basil.  The noodles were not overcooked, and the dish was well balanced. 

Crispy Duck Khao Soi.  The components of this dish by themselves wee not that remarkable.  Noodles that could be purchased at the 99 store (as I've done in the past), along with duck that has been crispy fried, and the curry.  However, blended together this dish was different, fun, and tasty. 

Garlic Prawn - A generous portion, crispy, lightly battered, infused with garlic.  

This has moved to the top of the list of Thai restaurants that I enjoy."}

{"text":"So I was in vegas for four days for a work conference. In the spirit of team building about ten of us decided to go to this restaurant. It was recommended by a friend of a friend's cousin...so we were a little skeptical. This place is in a shopping center away from a main road faced opposite from the road, so we were again a little sketched. As you walk in it looks like a normal restaurant, except I noticed a bunch of James Beard Awards on the wall...okay getting better. The menu was extensive. They had every thai food you could think of and then some more. Well instead of us searching, contemplating, arguing and then making up about the menu, we asked our server (that was the advice people kept givving us). 

Sure enough, the server recommended item after item, and instead of getting just one thing per person we went family style and shared everything. It was a celebration of Thai food. The curried lamb and chicken were amazing. The noodles and tofu were just right. Everything was spot on and on point. I now see why they received all of those James Beard Awards. We also imbibed on some Thai Beer \"Singha\", they have a large or a small...i would go for the large. They are good. 

Next time I am in Vegas I am definitly going here. The atmosphere is great, the servers are very helpful and they know the menu inside and out. Just make sure you make a reservation ahead of time...that place can fill up in a minute."}
{"text":"This is one of the great secrets of Las Vegas. The food quality is world-class and unlike typical Thai restaurants in that the menu includes Northern Thai cuisine, something not usually offered in Thai restaurants. The atmosphere is high-energy at dinner with plenty of people waiting to be seated and hanging around the bar. It is upscale casual with a combination of people in jeans and T-shirts as well as business people. The wine list is incredibly large. Anything you get will be amazing. Even the desert, sticky rice with mangoes, was out of this world! 

As of the time of this review, google had not yet recognized the new location. Be sure to simply click on directions through Yelp or you'll end up at their old location in a terrible strip center. The new location on E Tropicana is near the Strip but far enough away so as to avoid the undesired crowds. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food and a menu with items I had never heard of before during my limited exploration of this cuisine that make me wish I could have tried one of everything. The best part is that they ask you how hot you want your food on a scale from 1-10. Don't be a pussy if you go here...get your heat scored at 10. I dare you. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Good Thai food! But the price is also not cheap!
The shrimp is very delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I love authentic Thai cuisine, so I went with my nose turned up a bit, but I was confident that the top chef recommendations and ratings would not disappoint. Tom kha kai (chicken galangal soup in coconut milk) is one of my all time favorite Thai dishes and theirs is exceptional. The roasted red peppers added an extra burst of flavor.  My party ordered a variety of dishes and they were all excellent!  The Soft Shell Crab \"Drunken Noodle\" Pad Kra Pao was delicious! I'm not a big fan of crab dishes or noodles, so this one took me by surprise.  I'd order that again as well.  Definitely going back when I'm in Vegas!  I'd like to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome wine list, high quality stems, friendly service and reasonable prices.  LoS is justifiably famous.

Crispy pork with Chinese broccoli was incredible as were the Isaan specialties."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely fantastic meal here as usual. The beef thai salad and curry dishes are always fantastic here. The wait staff is friendly and food gets to you fresh and fast. Highly recommended and very close to the strip for access to gaming and shows!"}

{"text":"Uhmazing food! So many options from regions all over Thailand. Everything was bursting with flavor. It was a great contrast to the strip, both in style and quality as well as being much more affordable."}
{"text":"So this new place has some raised prices but the food is still worth it. Basically you can go with anything on the chef specials menu. Back 3 pages. Let's start it off. 

Prices used to be 23 now they are 30. 

Garlic prawns: 8/10. Just super crispy gaint and delicious. I dont know if the price is worth it anymore. But I deff try. 

Crispy duck drunken noodles: 7/10. Good food.  Just not the greatest flavor profile. just doesn't compare to the curries at this place 

Crispy duck panang: 9/10. Just a blast of flavor and make sure to get some extra suace and rice to eat! 

Green curry veg: 9/10 maybe 9.5. My friend this there and I just couldn't stop stealing spoonfuls from him. Haha. 

Service was pretty good. We just expected them to do something for my buddies 50th bday. Nothing came :-/"}
{"text":"Probably one of The best Thai restaurants in the country let alone Vegas.  Awesome wine list. Don't let the ugly shopping center detour you from eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat at Lotus of Siam for lunch regularly and occasionally for dinner.  My favorite dishes are Sea Bass with ginger, garlic Prawn and Thai fried rice.  I have had a couple of Northern dishes that were a bit too spicy for me but all in all I cant say that I have ever had a bad dish here.  The lunch buffet allows average people the pleasure of sampling awesome food at a reasonable price.  The food has remained consistent over the years and that is why this place remains one of the most loved places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Hillary Clinton of hyped restaurants: don't know why it is hyped, but always in the mouths of the bourgeoisie. Disappointed alludes to expectation. We had no expectations, and weren't surprised by the lack of taste in the food. The hype was not real for this place. Like Boobie Miles said, \"Hype is something that's not real.\""}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever eaten. Restaurant is so clean from the table tops to toilet. Service was impeccable. Must eat here is the GARLIC PRAWNS. Go grub now."}
{"text":"Bland would be a good word. If you can handle spice, go over what you think you can handle when they ask. He asked us out of 10, what our spice level would be. We said 7, learning our lessons from previous Thai restaurants. What we got was a 1. Zero spice. I was very sad.

What we ordered:

Crispy duck on drunken noodle ~$27: You get about a quarter of perfectly fried duck atop some drunken noodles, though the flavor signaled to me that the noodles were just a bit buzzed. They were very mild and reminded me a lot of pad see ew. The skin of the duck was extra crispy and made the dish IMHO. I also appreciated that the duck was deboned all the way. The biggest downside was the small noodle portion! We only got two bites, and for $30, we were expecting more duck, if not more noodles at least!

Jackfruit curry ~ $12: I would pass on this if you are expecting something like a curry. It was very watery, with very little flavor. The unripe jackfruit was very good, but the watery curry had little flavor...and again, it was watery, even more so than the soup. 

Green chili dip ~ $11 : Hard pass. It tasted like muddled bell peppers. Zero spice or any flavor other than bell pepper. Not even sure what the real dish is supposed to taste like, but I don't think this is it.

Shrimp Pad thai ~ $15: Good! Again, small portion.

Grilled shrimp with spicy green sauce ~ $12: This was probably my favorite since it was the least bland. The shrimp was big and grilled very well. It was served on top of some shredded cabbage. 

Tom yum and tom kah bowls, ~$5 and ~$6 respectively: Very good! Loved the soup here!

When I don't get why everyone else loves a place, and to me it was so-so, I tell myself that I probably ordered the wrong things. I'm definitely willing to give it a second shot when I'm back in Vegas. As always, YMMV. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place never can decide with a wife menu but had a great time and loved the food"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food in Vegas. I don't think anyone can beat this place.

Fantastic line up for wine. Great for business dinner as well."}
{"text":"While I'm usually a traditionalist and love my prawns with heads on, tentacles flailing, and beady eyes glaring at me,* I am willing to give Lotus a little hug...because if you take fat, juicy shrimp, glaze them with some sweet and hot sauce wrap them in bacon and fry them until the bacon is crisp and the juices from the bottom dweller are oozing about, you've got yourself an amazing dish that should never be passed up. I don't care how (in)authentic an appetizer it is, as long as it screams CRASH BANG BOOM in my mouth, that's all that really matters. 

And then there's the vegetable dish complete with various stir fried vegetables that seems as though they've been sitting in a vat of chili oil for years. They're spicy, juicy and perfect. The pepper seeds through the dish let you know that this is a Thai serious dish and you better damn well order sticky rice to offset some of that fire ferocity. 

Lotus. A flow. A sweet, pretty pink flower. So innocent. So harmless. Has turned my mouth into a raving lunatic. I want to go back to Vegas...but not for the grand casinos and the sexy showgirls, but for the bacon wrapped shrimp and an entree so unbelievably piquant that I'll have to return...to know that the Lotus wasn't just a mirage. 

*Kidding. I hate things with heads."}
{"text":"Next time you find yourself in the city Bugsy Siegel built do yourself a favor and leave bright lights of The Strip and head to Lotus of Siam for what will be the best Thai meal you'll ever have in the U.S.! 

My first piece of advise is, be ready to wait. It's a big place that works like a well greased engine but it's always packed.

Be adventures the menu is big with things that could sound scary to some but trust in your waiter (like I did) and you won't be disappointed.

My waiter recommend the three following dishes 

Nam Prik Ong - a dish made with a blend of spices, herbs and ground pork you can adjust the heat to your liking. Out of the three it was my least favorite because it was weird to eat without some sort of lettuce leaf to but it in. Still very good and I can see why it's one of Ming Tsai's favorite things to eat. 

The Nam Kao Tod- a crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausage, cilantro, green onions, ground dry chilies  ginger peanuts and lime juice was my favorite dish of the night. I'd never had anything like it before and all the components come together perfectly in every bite. Tip: Watch out of the dry peppers ;-)  

For my main dish the waiter recommend the Khao Soi a Burmese egg noddles coconut curry dish that was absolutely perfect. Creamy but not buttery, spicy but not overriding. Add the red onions and lime and it will take the dish to another level.

So next time you're in Vegas go hit the jackpot at Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!!!!  

Best Thai food hands down.  The crispy rice will take your breath away."}
{"text":"Local Neighborhood Bar of 36 years with Gaming.
Food available by delivery from Thai Restaurant or Fantastic Tacos.
Renovations still being done to update and clean up the bar!
Nice atmosphere to hang out, play pool jukebox or just have a few cocktails with friendly bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Oh heavens finally a THAI restaurant that I truly adore!! 
If my #MCM Anthony Bourdain dined here before and it was featured on Travel Channel's \"No Reservations\", then you know this place is a hit.
It hasn't even been a week yet and I'm back.

We came for the KHAO SOI! (Egg noodle with curry soup and chicken, northern Thai) best for your hangover! My favorite Thai dish ever.

Everything here is authentic and pure.

Not in the best location, but hey the best places are usually \"hole in the wall places\"."}
{"text":"Great food....we came in around 6pm on a Sunday and were told we had to wait 1 - 1.5 hours.  Try to make a reservation if you can"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Some of the best Thai food I have had. Judging the place from the exterior it looks sketchy but the food is insane. I usually hate buffets but their lunch buffet is super tasty. Don't be scared, eat here. And good luck trying to get a reservation. Just show up it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Quality thai food, flavors were rich and what I liked the most was it was felt light, nothing too heavy or greasy about it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Bring a couple friends so you can share all the wonderful dishes.  Wonderful food and we lucked out at lunch and had no wait - I'm guessing however that isn't the norm.  This is my new \"GoTo\" for Thai - most authentic found in Las Vegas to date - eat your meal with a spoon like a traditional Thai."}
{"text":"The best Thai in town! Not the most desirable location but it's totally worth it! There's a sweet lady that's a server there and she is the best! Cow (sp?) is her name. We tell her what we like and don't like and let her choose what she thinks is best. Delish every time!"}
{"text":"Ok so my brother-in-law is somewhat of a foodie like me... He suggested Lotus of Siam since he went there before and said it was really good. Funny this place is hidden behind a big building and you would never have thought to look for a restaurant behind. We got there at 5:30pm when they open. There were about 40 people already waiting in line outside. Oooh it must be good! When they opened the doors they sat people right away. I was surprised how big the place really was. I said to myself.. man it's going to take a long time to get our food and I was starving. Long story short they took our order and 15 minutes later all our food was there. We had six in our party so we ordered a lot of different plates. I really liked the garlic shrimp but all the dishes were excellent. Wish we would have ordered more but next time I know!"}
{"text":"This is on my list for one of my favorite Thai restaurants I've ever had. The other one is in my hometown, Fort Worth, TX. Everything seemed very authentic! The flat noodles with duck was so good! I've never had that type of dish before at a Thai resturant. The breaded fried prawns are to die for. I've haven't been to s Thai restaurant that serves prawns that way. I do not think we had a bad dish here at all.

The service here was ok. There were many times we had to wait for the waiter for quite awhile. They are possible short staff. Who knows! 

The tom kha was really tasty, too and came in an authentic Thai hotpot. This is a very unique and different Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"New location, same amazing food and service.  I cant wait until the wine list comes online.  Lotus is one of the best Thai restaurants in the US."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, this Thai restaurant is a hidden gem & offers authentic delicious food.  I had the spicy calamari salad & grilled beef strips over a bed of cabbage, both excellent & reasonably priced. Make reservations well in advance, it's always crowded (I reserved a table for TH evening @7:30 4 weeks ahead). Very large wine list - the Montepulciano for $8 was nice"}
{"text":"The best Thai food restaurant I have tried! Their crispy duck is really great! We tried the one with flat rice noodle, so awesome!"}
{"text":"Best thai place ive ever been.   Tried 10 things.   9 blew me away!   And the 10th item was still good imo.   My fave is crispy duck on drunken noodles.   Very well known great great restaurant

Best to get a reservation but once in a while u can just walk in.     They also do takeout."}
{"text":"Important tip: book a week in advance at least. Don't doubt you're in the wrong plaza. This plaza looks shady with no see-through windows. There will be homeless people asking you for money. This restaurant is in da hood. Who cares. You can offer them your leftovers (not the garlic shrimp though, which brings me to my next point...)

Ohhhhhh the yelpers are right. Always listen to us!!! Cos the garlic shrimp is so bomb diggity! They deep fry the whole damn thing and the shells and even the head are uber crispy and crusty (here, the crustacean can finally live up to its own name). They peel and devein the shrimp but the shell is still attached at the tail. So you take one bite of meat, then one bite of crispy shell, lick your fingers and your lips, and repeat, and hopefully you get to eat the last piece of the plate, because you'll most likely have to wait until your next Vegas trip to eat the shrimps again.

Moving on. Yummy soft shell crab drunken noodles! I've had lots of drunken noodles with chicken, beef, pork, shrimp... But soft shell crab was unprecedented. The portion wasn't as big as I expected, but the flavors were all there! Order it and you won't be disappointed!

Skip the tom kha and dessert. Flavor was bland, rice was hard and old!

Yum neau (beef salad) was worth a try. Make sure you order mild. Thai spicy cannot be undermined.

You might still have to wait for 5 to 10 mins even if you show up on time for your reservation, but at least they have a bar to let you have a drink while you wait. Service was awesome and staff were friendly.

Despite the few disappointing dishes, the good dishes were exceptional and unique. This is still a 5 star Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went here at around 11.30 so there was no line at all. I was immediately directed to a table. One of the best thai restaurants I've ever had! The crispy duck with panang curry was super delicious. The crispiness of the duck skin and the content flavor of the panang curry made this dish really good! I also tried the garlic prawn and it was da bomb! I ordered the crispy pork with chinese broccoli but it was just okay. The only downside to this restaurant was the price! I spent around $80 to try those 3 dishes plus a Thai tea."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got the chance to! I'm so happy I did. All the food is super fresh and has a very rich authentic Thai taste. I've tried a lot of Thai restaurants but the taste of food here tastes a bit different, in a really delicious way! Try their Tom Kah Kai soup, it's sooooo mmmmm good!!"}
{"text":"Great variety, huge menu, very authentic. Cheap prices for great quality food. And the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here before watching the show Sexxy, great time because no wait time on a Thursday. Service was great and food was amazing, the flavors of the yellow curry and our other beef dish with cilantro, lime and chili paste was good."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is always filled with people. The location is in a interesting area, but who cares as long as the food is delish! I must say the food is good. It has your traditional Thai that everyone is familiar with and also northern dishes. 

We thought we should try something different. We tried the duck curry, definitely a must try. I think my favorite. The jack fruit dish, it's an acquired taste. Not so much my favorite, but worth trying. We also tried the pork stew. Ummmm, it's good but I think I would like to try the sea bass when I go back.

They have such a wide variety of Thai cuisine. So try different things when you go. The service is efficient. They know how to accommodate. Make reservations just in case!"}
{"text":"The best Thai I've had in a long time!  The curry and Penang was to die for.  The shrimp and chicken were cooked to perfection! My husband enjoyed this family style gathering and the ambiance.  The selections and wine pairing w the server were very helpful.  It was a top notch night would not go anywhere else for Thai!! Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Best. Thai. Food. Ever.   Yes, we've eaten at literally hundreds of different Thai restaurants all over the country, and this is our favorite. Everything we've had has not only been of the highest quality with flavor profiles over the top, but those dishes ordered a second time were totally consistent in their preparation. One would never guess from the surroundings and the modest exterior that inside was a large and well-appointed restaurant with super efficient staff. They have a large menu, so there is something for everyone; I only wish I could have tried it all. One bit of warning: The place is popular, so a reservation would be a good idea."}
{"text":"Sea bass = amazing!
Everything else was good too.
I can see why it's won so many awards."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! If you're in vegas this is a must. Best thai food in the Western Hemisphere! Be sure to make reservations in advance!!! If you like spicy #35 spicy shrimp salad is SPICY!!! Loved the catfish cakes, and they had a real yummy coconut chicken soup. The roasted duck curry is amazing. I ordered my meal from the back northern menu. Letter G a pork style stew. Don't be afraid of the congealed pork blood. This was amazing. Wish I lived closer. If I'm back in vegas I'll be back to eat at this joint! This is not a place to be missed!"}
{"text":"After reading yelp reviews, I decided this place was a must-visit. I went there on a weeknight at 8:30pm, thinking I was late enough to be able to get in without waiting, but found out I had to wait FORTY FIVE MINUTES! That is how popular this place is. I ended up leaving and making a reservation for dinner 2 days later. If you want to eat here at dinner without a wait, you MUST call in advance!

Our waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items, since nobody in my group was familiar with thai food. He was very patient and gave us helpful suggestions, and our water was always promptly filled. Thank goodness for that, because the food was HOT.

My group likes spicy food, so we asked for our dishes to be prepared to a 5, 7, and 8 on the 1-10 spiciness scale. IT. WAS. INTENSE. Hence my drinking 3 glasses of water, and thank goodness my waiter was prompt in refilling my water because I might've died otherwise. If you ask for a number higher than 5, know what you're getting into: A 10 would be practically nuclear. 

I can't recommend the fried catfish enough. It's one of their specialties, and for good reason. We ordered fried catfish with basil. The catfish pieces were so tender and flavorful, they tasted like a much more expensive fish. Any of the curries is also delicious. One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips. For $10, all you get is a plate of blanched vegetables (which are pretty fresh, to their credit) and a cold \"dip\" which is often more like a salad. But the other items we had more than made up for this miss. 

I always imagine dives like lotus of siam to have giant portions, but the servings here are small, rendering the restaurant more expensive than the menu prices would suggest. It's enough, but you probably won't have leftovers. 

All in all, this place truly impressed me. I've never had thai food better than this!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service and food!

The garlic prawns alone deserve a five star rating! Absolutely the best I've ever had. Crispy with the perfect balance of flavors and spices. I also loved the pad see ewe and papaya salad. So good!

Their service is awesome. We ordered a spice level of 4 for all the dishes. I could not handle it after the first dish. We talked to the waiter and he was able to tone it down for our last few dishes. In the mean time, he gave me a free thai ice tea to help relieve all the spice. How nice was that. 

We went on a Wednesday night and it was crowded. We had to wait 30+ minutes. When we talked to the waiter that night, he told us that it was one of the slowest nights they had ever had. Go figure. He said that some of the workers didn't know what to do with themselves. haha 

The food is authentic and amazing. Plus the prices are good. I can see why this restaurant is so famous. I dream about returning again one day to order another plate of prawns."}
{"text":"Dang this place is good but go during off time so you don't have to wait for hours.  Price is worth it.  Portions are small but fulfilling and Thai coffee is really good"}
{"text":"I am not sure how I have managed to live in Vegas my whole life with the exception of my college years and have never eaten at Lotus until late 2014. My first time coming the line was out of the door and there was an hour and half wait. I waited cause I figured it had to be good to have all of these people waiting and taxi after taxi dropping people off. The walls are covered with numerous pictures and accolades which is always a good sign as well. The location is definitely in a shady area but well worth the trip. My favorites are the crab fried rice garlic shrimp prawns black pepper chicken shrimp chow mein and bacon wrapped prawns. The service is good as well I've only had bad service one time at this restaurant. But it is definitely the best Thai restaurant in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, (including on travel channel), I was super stoked to finally be able to try it. The 8 of us girls made our trek here from our plush hotel on the strip.  The storefront is a nondescript hole in the wall, located in a ghetto, fairly vacant strip mall.  However, once we stepped inside and were greeted by the friendly staff, we felt like we were transported to Thailand. 

The food lived up to all my expectations and all the hype.  Here are some we tried: drunken noodles, crispy rice, sea bass, a super spicy soup, garlic prawns. Honestly can't remember what else we ordered since we went mostly by our waiter's recommendations. We ordered 2 of each dish and every single one we gobbled up til we were practically licking the plate clean. Service was top notch and their massive wine selection was impressive. 

Tip: on Saturday evenings, if you dont have reservations and don't want to be stuck waiting around forever, get there BEFORE dinner service starts at 5:30. We got there around 5:15pm, were the 4th party in line, and got seated immediately when the doors opened at 5:30.  Your welcome!"}
{"text":"I have had Lotus of Siam on 3 occasions since moving to Las Vegas, 1 in the restaurant and 2 times for take out. 

The food served in the restaurant was a lot better than the experience I had with take out. I ordered the yellow curry and spicy noodles with shrimp for my first take out order. The styrofoam box the noodles were in looked like it had been stepped on, their was sauce all over the bag and it leaked on my counter. After preparing my first plate of food I noticed a black and white hair in my food. My friend and I were disgusted because it looked like an animal hair. I immediately called back Lotus and told them I would be bringing the food back for a refund. When I went into the restaurant I showed them how sloppily they had packaged it and the unknown hair in my food. They said it was probably a hair from one of the girls clothing and I told them it looked like a cat hair. After this they handed me my money and I could see they wanted me out of their restaurant.

Fast forward a few months later, Lotus is still the closest Thai restaurant to my place and I don't like Komol. I told my friend I wanted to order take out again and she was completely surprised I wanted to give them another chance. I ordered the panang curry with vegetables and asked what vegetables were in the dish. Penny, the owners daughter said carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I also ordered the Thai spaghetti with chicken. This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100% sure. Both the panang curry and Thai spaghetti were a solid three stars, but after my shocking take out order and misdescribed dishes the most I can give this restaurant is two stars."}
{"text":"This place is the biz ! Dishes here that you will not see anywhere else. The spicy here is hotter than most Thai restaurants here in town. I prefer to order from the northwest Thai menu. All adventurous options and each are unique ."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

My bf and I adored this place when we tried it for the first time last week. I can't believe we didn't try this place out sooner!! Service was so-so..but the food was great!

What we ordered:
- spicy chicken wings: DEEEELLISH! I think this was my bf's favorite. If you are in the mood for fried chicken wings, order this! It's fried wings covered in a sweet & spicy sauce so it's a bit sticky. These little things were just addicting and we loved every bite.

- drunken noodles w/ seafood: yummy while it's hot! The first bite was amazing. I haven't had drunken noodles this good in awhile. It's more saucy than I'm used to but the flavor was all there. They didn't skimp out on the seafood either. Mussles, shrimp, scallop, & imitation crab [disappointed in the imitation crab but that's ok]. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the noodles stuck together after awhile so it got clumpy. Flavors were still good so I accepted it lol. 

- braised short rib w/ panang: this was interesting. Decided to order it because of its popularity among yelp reviews. On the pricey side [~$17].. but it's braised short rib so I get it. I don't know if this is the best combination for my taste buds but I can see it growing on me. It's still good don't get me wrong and I might order it again. I think I would have liked it if the short rib was more moist..I think it was more on the drier side which is why I can't give it a glowing review. Maybe it was an off day..but that's just what I thought about it. 

I will absolutely come back the next time I'm in vegas. It's a must-stop!!!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of everything.

Plenty of seating and reasonable prices.

Good place to go that's off the strip and you are craving thai.

The shrimp dish was really good.

If you go though, I would recommend to go with a group of four or more so you can all order something different and sample each other's dishes."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anthony Bourdain says best Thai in the U.S. What are you waiting for?

Don't stick to what you know. You just don't stick to your stand-by Pad Thai here where there are so many other amazing  options.

Highlights:
Crispy Duck with Panang
Charbroiled Prawns with Fresh Chili, Garlic and Lime Sauce
Pas Se-Ew (Best I've ever had)"}
{"text":"So delicious! I had to take my dad there (who we consider to be the expert on Thai food) and he thought that it was fabulous and loved pairing wine with Thai food...which he had never done before. You absolutely have to try the crispy garlic shrimp and the panang curry! Oh and if you can hang with spicy...try the tom yum (soup) with prawns and chicken...it's the best:) It can be hard to get in so I recommend calling on a weekday to get a table for the weekend."}
{"text":"Superb never have I complained to a restaraunt of this status and actually got a solution. This has happened here. It's not often the quality of the food remsins  so consistent that i still crave it! Lotus keeps me wanting more!! The girl working the desk remembers me when I go in and for such a busy establishment this makes me feel so appreciated!  This place is awesome! I  lotus!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, DO NOT eat at a chain restaurant on the strip!  Go here. The parking lot is total sketch, and the gum-stained sidewalk outside the front door is creepy.  Open the front door and you will be awakened to a lively place to eat!  There is something to be said about a place that is open only 5pm-10pm on a SATURDAY!  They have a neat iPad app that will text you 15 minutes before your table is ready.  FYI - The portions are on the small side. ORDER TWO!!!!  The staff is absolutely fantastic.  They clear tables and seat someone else in two minutes, and your food comes out FAST.   I would literally  drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Try all of the northern dishes! It's what they do best. The khao soi with crispy duck is unique, delish and it's a huge serving which is good because it's a little on the pricy side. Worth the drive off the main strip. And something a little different and a bit on the humble side."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious! This place is usually packed but luckily walked straight in during a Friday lunch. Ordered the Garlic Prawns and Khao Soi which I would highly recommend! Great place and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place was really good. It is definitely one of the top Thai restaurants in USA, so, do swing by if you are in Las Vegas. Call ahead to make a reservation or risk not getting seated. Yes, it IS that popular. It is on a strip mall with questionable shops around it but once you step inside, it is packed ! 
They have a lot interesting dishes like their special crispy duck in curry (good but the dish is very heavy for 2 to share- plus the crispiness of the duck disappears once it has soaked long enough in the curry), kao soi (curry noodle), garlic shrimp (fried shrimp with shells on- which I am not quite a fan on). Their coconut ice cream is a good way to end the night. Overall, I think they have dishes that are unique but their dishes can be quite heavy and are definitely pricier than most places - thus the 4 star."}
{"text":"Service was great. They have many people on staff to make sure you are taken care of. They also know how to give you space when you are eating. Prepare to wait in line, but they do take your number and text you when your table is ready. Atmosphere is nice  and great selection of wine. 

The food was great. My favorite would have to be the crispy duck panang curry. Probably the best curry dish I have ever had. Even reheating it the next day was amazing. We wanted to immediately go back. The garlic prawns were pretty good. Not sure if I would order again though and lastly the Tom yum soup was good."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd visit.  the first two were great and we were looking forward to another great meal.  Very disappointing.  Our waiter took a long time just to get our beverage order.  We ordered the same items as our last visit, but again, disappointing.  The wontons were over cooked, the stuffed chicken drumsticks were tasteless and the pad tai wasn't near as good as before.  They forgot our soup order, which had a weird taste, and then brought it after we received all our other entrees."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice interior considering the ghetto commercial area this place is in. Would be hard to find unless you were looking for it.

The food and prices here are on par with the Thai restaurants in SGV, which is a good, but not great thing. I had the pad thai and red duck curry, both which matched that description."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ever eaten in my life. Get off the strip and check this place out. Very affordable and the best dish you can get in Vegas"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I ordered the penang curry, garlic shrimp, drunken noodle soft shell crab and pad thai! Everything is awesome, except for the pad thai. The pad thai is okay, but not something extraordinary. 1 star off because the price is too expensive for small portions"}
{"text":"Ask for the special menu. And get something seasonal that the chef recommends. Not to say the regular menu is a slouch. But, to find out why this place is just a bit better than most Thai places, you need to expand your horizons. I'd definitely go with a fish dish, maybe something spicey, and break out of your comfort zone and order something you've never had.

The expansion hasn't done a thing for the food. The bar is a tad pricey, and the seating can get downright funky. And you need to go on a relatively non-busy day to escape the crowds.

So, go here for some authentic Thai dishes that are extraordinary. Don't go if you're not willing to be adventurous and only want another order of Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Starting to feel a little less generous about my rating for Lotus.

The last few trips have been sub par compared to my first two. Waiters have been less attentive and rarely return to check up on your meal unless they are hurrying you to finish your meal so they can turnover the table. Food has been arriving to the table lukewarm and under or overcooked. Portions are even getting smaller.

I'm kind of embarrassed because I highly recommended this restaurant to my friends visiting and they were less than impressed. The only constant is the mango sticky rice. 

Not exactly planning my next trip back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Let me paint a picture for you.  You're walking on the decrepit sidewalks of Old Las Vegas.  The smell of sewer is ripe.  There are meth addicts accosting you for change .  However, you have a mission.  The mission, if you choose to accept it, is to eat the best Thai food in North America.  I, and I hope you, choose to accept it!

I've eaten here twice.  The first time I got Tom kha kai and the special duck breast with drunken noodles.  The soup is INTENSELY flavorful.  The magic of Thai cuisine is the perfect balance of sweet, salty, sour, and piquant.  If you increase one, you have to increase the others.  Obviously, if you go overboard with any of them, the dish is ruined.  The soup was a perfect example of this philosophy - it was as flavorful as it could possibly have been.  If there was 1 more grain of salt, 1 drop of lime, it would have been too much.  The line of perfection is skirted so asymptotically, you'll think there IS no 99.99999999999%.

You'd think that, but you'd be wrong.  That extra 9 at the end?  The Tom yum goong will take you there.  Intense is all I can say - you cannot prepare your taste buds for the shock they will receive during a single bowl of this.  

The duck was cooked absolutely perfectly.  Crispy, delicious skin, perfectly rendered, tender meat.  The noodles were spicy, and perfectly complimented the duck.  

The Pla Laad Prik (whole fried fish with pepper sauce) was incredible.  It's exactly what it sounds like.  And it's delicious.

On top of all the incredible food (and to tame the heat, you are getting it spicy, right?), they have a huge list of Rieslings which are not only a perfect compliment to the meal, but are extremely reasonably priced.  

Forget whatever silly plans you had for a couple hours one night in Vegas; spend them here, getting a meal you will never forget."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation of a friend while in town for work and was not disappointed. I'm usually not the biggest fan of Thai food, but I'm honestly now thinking it might be the places where I'm from. Food was fantastic, everything was full of flavor, and service was great!"}
{"text":"i am mean what is 5 stars. ive been doling them out too kindly. it should be reserved for food like this. food that changes my fucking life. food that burns and singes my mouth as i shovel it down fearlessly.

a 50 dollar plus check for one awaits me. bring it on. if i had more space in my stomach, id order more.

the nam prick did me dirty. a 4 spice level sends a hallucinary level of spice through me. the thing was, it was so good on the first bite that i took like 15 more too quickly. then the heat set in. 

 luckily the waiter noticed and brought out the thai iced tea i ordered quickly and refilled my water. beer does not quench this kind of spice.

the food arrived in a timely sequence. the papaya salad, at a level 3 was actually more manageable. at this point my face is already red and dripping, but i just kept eating knowing the khao soi would be my relief.

and oh was it. creamy, brothy, rich, flavorful and meaty. basically every adjective one could use to describe food, this khao soi was it. 

compared to andy richters version at pok pok in portland, this shits all over it. andy who? just someone on anthony bourdain's show who thought he could recreate thai food.

but not this well. this was the greatest thai meal of my life. until i eventually go to thailand of course"}
{"text":"Great prices, really tasty food. I took a girl here, we ordered the Yom Yom Shrimp (I think) we had some spicy coconut cream chicken with white rice. It was delicious. The drunken seafood dish was kind of clunky, and I didn't need it. I want to go back and try some of the other options. The green tea was good ;). I liked the check the best, very manageable for the amount of flavor and fun we had. The service was flawless."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!!
Super tasty, wonderfully priced, great service. 

Highly suggest you try this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star solely on the crispy duck panang.  holy crap I don't think I've ever had a better duck curry.  I can't even begin to describe all the ways that the curry sauce flavors danced around my taste buds.  It's a wonderful creamy red curry paste with coconut flavors.  

The rest of the dishes, like the garlic prawns, and the crab fried rice were probably very good but I just kept on trying to eat rice with the red panang sauce.  Where do they have something comparable in LA???? Or do I have to go back to LV this weekend."}
{"text":"We were confused by the neighborhood and the exterior of the restaurant, but surprised by the quality of the food and service. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"there was 5 of us, 1 filipino dude (me), 1 Vietnamese, 2 white guys and 1 mexican guy.  So you know how the in thing now is for a group of friends wiht different races that we tease jokingly about being that race...And we especailly make fun of each others accents...anyways...i guess one of the white guys was reading the menu with an asian accent, hilarious but maybe not a good idea in an asian restuarant.  
Good thing no one heard us. Thought i would share that story.

So i tried the crispy duck which my coworker was raving about since he first tried it.

I'm not the most adventorous eater but that duck was awesome....
we also tried the papya salad..YES! Make sure u get that.
make sure you pick your spicey level, coz that drunken noodles we got was real spicey (no deduction on stars because that was my fault)

we also got the prawns tempura..good starter.

But i have to go back to the duck.  When you go to your local park and see ducks, you will see them differently, I SWEAR!  I can't wait till the ducks start flying north coz i will have my weapon ready to go."}
{"text":"The greatest Thai place ever, we make it a priority to go back every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy! Very clean. Not only the atmosphere but also the food. 
Either have a reservation or get here right at 5:30pm. We have showed up several times w/o a reservation and been turned away. 
Prices are very reasonable. Food is just perfect in every way. 
Meals tend to be on the spicy side so drop your number by 1 or 2 from what you usually order. At most places we order 6 or 7 but here we order 4 or 5."}
{"text":"I went here two nights ago, and have been waiting to post this review because I am still fuming about our visit to this god forsaken establishment.

i wish to the fucking black lord that i could give negative stars... or even zero stars, but yelp forces you to give at least one, so that one star will go to #109 on the menu. the \"boat noodle soup\" that was fucking delicious... anyway... 

so while were waiting to get seated we hung out at the bar to get some refreshments. i ask the waitress what their \"thai lime drink\" was and she responds, \"it's a thai lime squeeze\". uhm okay, i understand there's a language barrier, so i ask waitress #2 and she explains to me that its kind of like a limeade except its not fresh squeezed and they use concentrate instead. im like cool, okay. we get seated a couple minutes later and waitress #2 ends up being our server and asks what we would like to drink. we order a round of waters and i ask for the thai lime drink andthis bitchhhhhh says \"oh we're actually out of that\". .......... ....... okay so uhmmm how come you didnt fucking mention that when i fucking asked you earlier what the fuck the drink was made of???!???!?!!! so then im like, okay how about thai tea? and she goes, oh were out of that too.... at this point, im trying to keep the frustration off my face and i say \"are you out of regular iced tea?\" and she says no, so im like okay thats what ill get.

they bring the drinks out and explain that their kitchen is closing in a few minutes so we need to place our orders. we order the boat noodle soup, crab fried rice, pad thai, wonton soup, crispy duck panang, crispy duck khao soi, garlic prawns, and crispy duck drunken noodles x2 (chefs recommendation btw).

as were waiting for our food we notice that the tables around us that arrived after us are starting to receive their food first... were like okay, maybe its because we had a big order, nbd. 

twenty minutes later they bring out our rice, boat noodle soup, wonton soup, pad thai, & garlic prawns. we start to eat, so far so good, delicious.

ten more minutes pass by.

then twenty.

then my boyfriend when to to go poop and when he came back he was like \"our food's still not ready?!\"

finally he goes to ask our waiter...

our fucking waiter... this is what he says... \"oh i just found out our kitchen is out of duck.\"

what.

what.

you're fucking joking right? 

hahahahahahhahahahaha -me at that moment.

at what point.... at what fucking point were you going to relay that message to us???? were you just going to let us sit there??? what if we had never asked about the rest of our food??? we couldn't even choose anything else off the menu because we had heen waiting so long that their fucking kitchen was closed.

clearly we were upset and we were letting them have it, and their response was \"we're so sorry, would you like a free dessert?\"

hell the fuck no! why would we want dessert when we came here for dinner and obviously didn't get to eat dinner????! stupid mother fuckers.

no. no no no thats it, we've been here long enough, give us our bill.

get this guys, the bill was fucking wrong. they tried to charge us for thai tea and a coke. when the hell did we even order a coke during all of this? and why would you charge us for a thai tea that you said you're out of???!

ughhhhh im about to get an aneurysm while typing this. 

long story short, they didnt compensate us for anything and we didnt tip them shit.

fuck you guys. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

fuckkkkkk youuuuu."}
{"text":"DUCK NOODLE SOUP. 

I've never had anything like it...the broth was sweet, tangy, and addictive. I've had duck noodle soup at various other Thai restaurants in California but Lotus of Siam makes it incredibly well. Came here at 6pm on a Sunday night with 3 others. We made a reservation, so we were seated promptly. When we left at 8pm, there were about 20 people waiting in line. I would not come here without making a reservation.

While vacationing in Vegas, several people were telling us about Lotus of Siam. Some went so far as to describe this restaurant as the best Thai restaurant in all of America. I'm not sure if I can confirm that statement, but it is pretty darn good Thai food. 

We ordered:
Panang Curry: (5/5)
Pad See Ew: (5/5)
Pad Kee Mau: (5/5)
Catfish soup: (3/5) I would not get this again
Duck noodle soup: )6/5) When can I come back here?!! Can't get enough of this stuff. 

Random fact: they have an extensive wine menu and a poppin' bar area."}
{"text":"After hearing about this restaurant on the internet, I made a note that we had to go there while in Vegas for the SEMA show. We ended up going with a friend of my dad's who is usually not adventurous, a possible recipe for disaster. 

We did not make a reservation, and paid the penalty of a 45 minute wait - reading glorious reviews in the cramped front hallway. (This was pre-renovation.) I thought 45 minutes of reading \"Best Thai Restaurant\" reviews would overhype the food to a level that could not be reached. I was wrong.

This was back in November, so I have forgotten the dishes that we ate, but this meal still gets discussed fondly to this day. After sharing a mix of delicious appetizers, we simply told our waiter the protein, sides and level of spice we wanted - and let him bring a dish of his choice. When they arrived we all tried some of each others dishes, and everyone was happy & well fed. There were no leftovers.

Highly recommended for all Thai food lovers. We only wished we had ordered another full meal to take away!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Thai food! We ordered the crispy duck Panang curry, larb, and sides with sticky rice. The larb was special ordered with duck :) SO DELICIOUS!! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"No trip to Vegas was ever complete without visiting Lotus of Siam. My fiancé and I have been going to Lotus of Siam every time we have gone on a Vegas trip. However, I have to say this might have been the lady trip to Lotus. The lunch buffet selection looked totally different with more Chinese food than usual and the Pad Thai, which was the one thing that I always looked forward too wasn't the same. The Pad Thai was light in color and bland. Usually, the Pad Thai is very orange and the flavorful, so flavorful that sometimes when I'm back in CA I contemplate on going to Vegas just so I can eat the Pad Thai at Lotus of Siam. Also, besides the Pad Thai being bland all the other food just didn't taste the same and was a little off. I don't know if the little Thai lady isn't cooking the food anymore because I didn't see her or maybe they sold it? But, whatever you changed Lotus of Siam, PLEASE change it back to what it use to be, it's just not the same. I'll probably try it one more time on a different Vegas trip because that's just how much I loved lotus of Siam and I hope they just had a temporary cook for the day."}
{"text":"There is a huge hype for this place and a few people were saying how this is probably the best Thai in the country while I was waiting. I waited 25 minutes on a Friday night which really wasn't so bad. My party got the garlic shrimp, crispy duck with curry, salmon lover, side order of cucumber salad and fried banana. The food took maybe 15 minutes to serve. I guess the crispy duck is their signature dish and it was my favorite. The salmon lover wasn't anything special and the homemade sauce was very salty. The garlic shrimp had a nice crisp, a bit pricey for fried shrimp and shrimp shells. Their fried dishes have been the best so far. My salmon lover dish was probably a 3, but I'm giving it a 4 because I liked the duck dish. If you're coming here, you'll definitely be happy with their fried dishes. All of them have a nice crisp and well fried. This was probably the most expensive Thai food I've had (almost 100 for Thai food), but I guess that's vegas for you."}
{"text":"Came here because literally everyone said it was the best Thai food they have ever had. Having gone to Thailand I can say it was pretty good. I usually judge a thai place based on their pad thai and this place had pretty good pad thai. Not my favorite, but still really good. It seemed a little more americanized than other places I have gone. Servers were all awesome and so helpful and kind. The only thing I feel I really need to say is steer clear of the coconut soup. It literally tastes like what throwing up in your mouth tastes like. Complete stomach acid. Also there is a line out the door before it even opens so get there before 5:30 or make a reservation if you want a chance at getting in. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"So on this trip to Lotus, we tried Tom Yum Kai- chicken with spices and tomatoes and mushrooms - at spice level 6 - it was spicy. Be prepared.  We also had the shrimp which the seasoning dipping sauces is the best. The shrimp by itself is not much food so it will give you the ability to try more dishes. We had the usual chicken curry which is always good."}
{"text":"Tired of overpriced hotel foods, long buffet lines, hassle of finding great places to eat...well look no further. The best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas is at Lotus of Siam and it's only a 7 min drive from the strip off Sahara. Best make reservations if you have parties of 4 or more since this place always has a wait.

Here are a few musts from the menu:

1) Thai iced tea
2) Garlic Prawns (they fry them season them and still keep the skin on...must have)
3) Duck curry (spicy levels from 1-10, we had the 8 and it was pretty spicy...so stick with 5-6 for those who just want a medium kick)

Staff's very attentive and supposedly they have a great wine selection, but I have yet to try anything. I always make a pit stop anytime I come back to Las Vegas...I found a gold mine."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend that you make a reservation before trying to go to Lotus of Siam. I made a reservation for 4 two weeks in advance for a Friday dinner, and the only time available was right at 5:30PM when they opened. When we arrived, there were already lines forming out the door to be seated, so if you don't reserve, expect to wait a long time! 

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Lotus of Siam. For an authentic Thai restaurant, they really class the place up! The seating is mostly booths; it's well-lit inside, and the tables are far enough apart that you'll get a fair amount of privacy (aka conversations won't overlap between tables). The service is also excellent! They are really attentive, refilling your glasses anytime it goes below the halfway line and coming by to clean your table and give you new plates at the drop of a crumb. As for the food, for 4 we ordered:
1. Duck Khao Soi (under Northern Thai section): By far my favorite thing here! It is soooo delicious. The duck is crispy on the outside with juicy tenderness on the inside. The noodles soak up the curry flavoring so well. And the curry itself is just the right balance of spice, cream, and a little hint of sweetness. This is definitely a very unique dish that I really enjoyed; however, it is quite pricey ($30), but worth it for the person who wants to try something new.
2. Ginger Sea Bass: This was also a delicious dish! They do such a good job cooking the sea bass. It's tender and kind of flaky, and the dish itself is very light on the palette. It comes with a lot of vegetables, and the ginger isn't too overpowering. For those who want a lighter meal, this is a great option. It doesn't quite have the Thai flavoring (spicy/sweet), it's definitely more like a Chinese dish, but still very enjoyable. ($30)
3. Garlic Prawns: This dish comes with 7 large fried crispy prawns, and then they fill up the bowl with just the fried outer shells of the prawns to make it look more filled. I think they do a good job with spicing the prawns; it's garlicky and a little oily with a kick of spice. However, I think that the prawns end up being a bit too hard and not enough crispy. When you bite into it, it takes too many \"chews\" than I would have liked. I probably wouldn't order this again. ($28)
4. Crispy rice appetizer: This was my least favorite dish. I felt that it was way too crispy to the point that it was hard to chew and almost hurt. The flavoring was just all salt and citrus without much depth. I wouldn't order this. ($9)
5. Shrimp pad thai: Amazing! I know, I know, why get a pad thai at a fancy Thai restaurant with so many other unique options. But I actually really loved their pad thai. The noodles are definitely unique here; they're super chewy, way more than other places, but they soak up the sauces so amazingly well. Every bite is full of delicious flavor, and the shrimp that they give are huge! ($13) Plus, it's one of the cheaper items on the menu that will still fill you up.

Overall, I had really high expectations for Lotus of Siam. I think the Duck Khao Soi is amazing and worth the hype, and the service is great, but the other dishes really aren't as good or worth the pricing. Fun experience, but I probably wouldn't go back and spend the $$$."}
{"text":"I don't usually order duck. It's not my first choice.  But on the recommendation of several people, I ordered the crispy duck w curry on noodles...   Get the duck.  It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food by far in Vegas!!!!! 
We love the new location it's a lot nicer.
I have never had anything bad on the menu."}
{"text":"The best thai food I have ever had hands down. We ordered the crispy prawns, seafood soup, pad see ewe, beef salad, roast duck with some sort of curry sauce and fried bananas with coconut ice cream for dessert. The stars of the night were the crispy prawns and pad see ewe. I am neither a prawn fan nor a pad see ewe fan but those dishes left me wanting more. Oh. My. God. The crispy prawns were deep fried and partially deshelled for ease of eating with a delicious garlic sauce on the outside. The pad see ewe was just perfect, it had the wide thick noodles with just the seasoning. 

Can't wait to go back to Vegas for this place."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from the pad Thai  to the pork ginger, beef pepper and the cashew chicken. Will definitely come again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here blows other thai food out of the water. Hands down best value/price restaurant in vegas.

Crispy catfish with basil (4/5) - I had this dish twice in 2 occasions. First time it was really good, catfish was crispy and the sauce was on point. Second time the catfish was a bit soggy (maybe they didn't immediately serve it once it was cooked?). I would have given it 5/5 otherwise.

Crispy rice salad (4/5) - Tasty. One of the better crispy rice salad I've had.

Duck panaag (5/5) - This duck curry was INSANELY good. In fact. this is probably one of the top 3 curry-based dish I've tasted ever. The duck was juicy, delicate, and soaked in the sweet savory umami liquid. Get it.

nam prik ong (4.5/5) - I've never had this dish in another thai restaurant before. It was really good. It also tasted quite unique so if you haven't had it before I highly suggest it.

Northern Larb (2.5/5) - Seasoned well, but very dry. Not a fan.

Mango and sticky rice (4/5) - The sticky rice was a bit salty, paired really well with the sweet mango and coconut milk.

I would come to this place again every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never reviewed this place, but I do know that I have celebrated many important milestones here. Food is solid. Service is genuine. Friends and I always leave full and happy without breaking our bank. There's a lot of parking. Their restrooms are clean. We often order the whole catfish, the crispy duck panang, the nem kao tod, and ask for off menu items. Make it a point to come here if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. It Was Pretty good. I saw a wall full of famous people that came to the restaurant,  such as Alicia Keys, Nicolas Cage and some famous stars from the Food Network. Can't remember all the dishes we ordered, but we got pad see ew, crab, red curry, and some other dishes. Service was good and quick. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a good authentic Thai restaurant near the strip."}
{"text":"LORD HAVE MERCY!!!

We came here to eat dinner for my man's big sister's B-day celebration & I really just want to say OMG!!! I was so full but I WANT EVERYTHING all over AGAIN!!!! O_ O & end my review w/ that.... but I have to EXPRESS what wonderful flavors I got to experience.

Service was on PAR they were quick & not once did u see my glass of water ever get below half way. They really had TEAMWORK on point. We had a reservation at 6pm & the place was PACKED even in the little waiting area & it did NOT slow down at all even as we were leaving....

The plaza that this resteraunt is located literally makes you re-think if you want to be dining there.... but do Not let this fool you or drive you away in any way! Definitely like finding a treasure box in the middle of the desert!
The interior was simple w/ not too much cluttering decor. The waiting area & entrance was quite small. There are a whole but of pictures that are framed of all the famous people that have dined here one being the GREAT Chef Joel Robouchon. They also have a glass cellar of wines galour that is one of the only thing that makes this resteraunt give it a CLASSY look hahahaha =]

SPICY WINGS $8.95 - just full of flavor & the right amount of spice to blend w/ the sweetness

SCALLOP DRUNKEN NOODLE $23.95 - Scallops were HUGE & again another flavor packed dish

FRIED WHOLE FISH - this fish was amazing like the bones we're crispy enough to be like chips.

GARLIC PRAWN $26.95 - OMG OMG I could eat a freaken whole plate to myself. The crispyness of this dish is PERFECTION!

PLAR LAAD PORK $25 - I think this one was the curry sauce that went well w/ the rice that it came with.
 
NAM KAO TOD $8.95 - a nice crispy rice appetizer dish that is refreshing w/ the perfect amount of spice & still refreshing w/ some weggies on the side.

FRIED BANANA ROLL $8.50 - cute little wonton shell rolled banana w/ the perfect crunch to every bite

MANGO & STICKY RICE $8.95 - O_O soon good!! They also do NOT serve this dish if the mango is not to perfection!

YUM NAUH $13.95 - THAI beef salad refreshing w/ a kick

THAI TEA $2.50 - not the BEST that I've had but it was still good.

But all in all EXPECT a wait if you don't make a real!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it is what they all say it is.  I'm drooling already without even getting into the dishes!  It's a pretty busy and popular place despite the location.  A little iffy and sketchy.  Just make sure you don't leave anything valuable anywhere!  Take it with you.  There is a line before it opens, so be sure to get there early.  We got there just in time when they open and we got a seat.  We knew what to ordered immediately.  Service is great as usual.  Placed our orders and waiting oh-so patiently.  The crispy duck panang...mm mmm MMMMM!!!  we had to order two of those.  Pad See Eww with beef was delicious, the fish larb was my first and it was actually really tasty.  I usually get the norm - chicken.  We also ordered the crispy rice salad dish.  That was a good combo, love the crunchiness.  Spicy fried rice was perfect, I don't think you can really go wrong with what you order.  Unless you have food restrictions. And for the finale, you cannot go to a thai place and not order mango with sticky rice!!!  My absolute favorite dessert."}
{"text":"Wow I arrived here at 5 it opens at 5:30 already a line started and this was on a Tuesday. I usually eat white person thaiee food I was eating alone an ass for the recommendation from the waitress and was not let down"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam...what has not been said about this place?   Food is incredible, affordable and unique.  

Must haves:  

Garlic prawns.  Over half the tables have prawns whenever I'm there.  Crispy,  flavorful, delicious.  Don't forget to eat the shell and tail.  It might sound a little odd, but you'll thank me.  One of my favorite dishes in the city.

Crispy duck on drunken noodle.  It's always on my table when I'm eating at lotus.  Great flavor in the duck and the noodles.

Nam prik ong.  Ming Tsai called it the best dish he's had in Vegas.  Considering the foodie nature of the city, those are big words.  A non spicy chili dip with ground pork and served  with vegetables.  not sure why it's so good...it just IS.  

ONE THING TO NOTE...they specialize in northern Thai cuisine.   Order off that section of the menu, along with the chef specialties.  Don't come here looking for mind blowing pad Thai, curry, or anything you're used to eating at a \"normal\" Thai place.  This is the holy grail of Thai restaurants...order what they do best.  If you have questions...the servers will be more than happy to assist you.  

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many people rave about this place - small little hole in the wall.  I had no idea how many times I've driven past this restaurant when I am in town.  The location is a kind of run down shopping center. 

I tried it last Saturday.  They opened at 5:30pm, we arrived around 5:50 and there was a 45 minute wait. 

We ordered the beef pad thai, beef panang, yellow curry, sweet and sour pork, pad sw-ew and kra phao moo krob to share.  I had my kids with me so we each ordered one dish that we wanted to try and shared.

All the dishes were flavorful, the pad thai was hands down the best I've ever tasted.  The Kra Phao Moo Krob was probably the best dish we had.  Deep fried pork with basil, oh my!!!  Crispy yet as it sat in the sauce, the flavors of the sauce penetrated the pork and just made it absolutely delicious.  The Panang was a little spicy for me, but was also flavorful.

I can't wait to go back and try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside, but inside it's lavish. They even showcase their cold wine room in glass.

The food, based on northern Thai, was superb! We had the pad woon sen and their original dish kang ka noon made with Jack fruit, $10.95 each. Both were delectable and a good size. Total price was $23.68 but worth it since it's fresh. 

The service was extremely friendly and patient with our order, since they have a large menu! As Thai connoisseurs from LA, since we frequent Thai Town often, we recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING, best Thai we ever had! Service is awesome. Off the beaten path and one of the highlights of our trip. Come here!"}

{"text":"Anytime we are in Vegas, we HAVE to go here.

This place has some of the best Thai food you will find. I have not had anything here that I did not like, and we try all new dishes every time we visit.

Get here early (they open at 5:30pm) to avoid waiting in line."}
{"text":"Matched the hype! It was worth the 15 min Uber ride from the strip. 

Ambiance plays a great role in the way I rate my food. In Lotus of Siam you have authentic Thai food (really yum) combined with the ambiance of a place that's stuck in the 1990s (in an unpretentious way)."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

This is the best Thai food I've had in Las Vegas and some of the best I've had anywhere.  I've been here many times for lunch, and I try to get there before 11:45am because often a line starts forming at noon.

I had the buffet once, and it was so-so  All the other times were ordered from the menu.  My fav is the panang curry - they do a great job with it.  Sweet, spicy, a lot of depth and subtle flavors.  

The one thing that's inconsistent there is the spice level.  I've ordered a 9 and it wasn't so spicy while other times Ive ordered a 7 and it was spicy as a regular 9."}
{"text":"Warning: this \"authentic\" thai food is pre-packaged and most of their sauces and bases are manufactured in places where the food regulations aren't as stringent as US guidelines. There are liberal amounts of MSG in their food too. I asked the server if I could get something without MSG and he said, \"ok, we won't add any extra to your dish.\" what?? I don't want any to begin with. The server then explained that the pre-packaged sauces come with MSG in it. The he followed up with \"well, there's not too much in there.\" I doubt it, and he was becoming visibly frustrated that I was insistant that something on their menu had to be actually made from scratch, and not reheated or reconstituted. 

I've had much better Thai food, the food here is nothing special. think it's a shame that all these Yelpers are reviewing how great this food is when it's pre-made and flavor-enhanced with Monosodium Glutamate. Sure you save a few bucks by not eating on the strip, but you exchange a slice of your health and soul in the process. Enjoy the chemicals, sheeple."}
{"text":"In from Philly guy on plane said this place a must do. Apparently lucky to get reservations many suggest days in advance. 

Place busy.  Wait staff excellent.  Food very authentic which is why I went with 5 stars.  

I strongly recommend going when in Vegas"}
{"text":"THis place was not bad but not worth missing the other so  many superior restaurants in Vegas for. I prefer THAI in Shirlington in Arlington Virginia to this place any day.  I am not sure that it has deserved all the press.  It is just not all that!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this magical land known as Lotus of Siam. I only had the lunch buffet which was above average in flavor and variety. Here's the run down. 

Yellow curry chicken- Delicious flavor, but not enough chicken. HUGE chunks of potatoes. Tasty enough to have thirds(shhhh) 

Orange chicken- Tasty enough to have seconds 

Teriyaki chicken wings- OMG these were good. 

Chow mein and egg rolls- Nothing to write home about 

Fried Banana Rolls- HOLY SHIT these things made me forget my name for a minute. I got lost in their warm, soft bananas with crunchy outside. You don't even want to know how many I ate. 

Overall I over ate and over drank with three Thai Iced Teas, but who's counting calories at this place? I am hoping to go back very soon and try something with beef or pork in it. Lotus of Siam is definitely deserving of a second date."}
{"text":"Love this place. Such a great experience and the food is always out of this world. Whenever I need to take business associates out for dinner Lotus of Siam always delivers. Something different from the typical places on the strip and totally worth the effort."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Thai food in the US!

Reservations are STRONGLY recommended or you'll be waiting outside for a table.

We always make a point to go there overtime we travel to Vegas - and we always get the same 4-5 dishes."}
{"text":"I dream about finding restaurants like this.

Huge menu, lots to explore, and a whole section on Northern Thai specialties.  The waiter says \"you really prefer Northern Thai food?\".  No, I'm just smart enough to make sure we include things you can't get at every strip mall Thai restaurant in the country.

They are in a strip mall, by the way :)

I need to explore more, but let me recommend a few things we liked: NAM KAO TOD, KHAO SOI BRAISED SHORT RIB, THUM KA NOON (with Jackfruit!).

My biggest regret is the number of times I went to Vegas and didn't know about this place.  Last trip went twice in 4 days.  Couldn't get enough.

The food is outstanding and underpriced.

I would take you there right now if I could."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times now with different groups of friends.  I've been lucky enough to try a variety of different dishes.  No matter what you order, it will be delicious.  I can guarantee that.  There are so many tasty dishes here I can't begin to name them all, but In my opinion, there are 2 must try items:

Garlic Prawns - The prawns are deep fried with their shells.  The prawn shells are reminiscent of shrimp chips.  The prawns were cooked perfectly.  The garlic sauce that the prawns are prepared in is so delicious!!  Umami goodness.  

Crispy Duck Panang - I can't say enough about this dish.  It is super good!  The duck is perfectly crispy and provides a nice contrast in texture to the panang curry which you'll undoubtedly pour over your rice.  You'll have dreams about this after you eat it.  It is just that delicious!!

The only negative is that, compared to a lot of other good Thai restaurants around town, this place is about twice as expensive.  If you don't mind paying more for arguably the best Thai food in America, then this place is for you.  As great as the food was, I'd say that the portions were a bit small for the price you paid.  If the portions were a little bigger I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Some of my restaurant friends really love this place and would give it 5 stars. Though I do like this place and would recommend it, I still favor some of the Thai restaurants I've been to in San Francisco for a combination food and atmosphere.

With that being said, service here has always been good. The wine list is appropriate for the fare and the food in general is quite good. I had the lobster special once and was a little disappointed. Not that it wasn't good... but it just didn't stand out to me.

All of the currys here are very good. Try the roasted duck curry with pineapple if you're undecided.

The beef jerky, NUA DAD DEAW, is a little too dry but the try the satay as an appetizer.

You can't really go wrong here. It's just not romantic enough or divey enough to give me the rounded 5 star food and atmosphere rating."}
{"text":"Every time I make the trip to Las Vegas, LOS is a must.  Over a number of visits, I've had the chance to sample a broad swath of their menu, and the food lives up to the mountains of accolades.  The flavors are authentic Thai - you can taste and smell the fish sauce and the kaffir lime leaf and the birds eye chilis.  Lunch after lunch, dinner after dinner, it's always consistently excellent.

A tip for the culinarily curious - order the funky sounding stuff, and/or anything off the northern Thai specials page.  That's where the money is at LOS (if you're looking for your #2 Special sweet, peanutty, saucy pad thai with Thai iced tea, you may be not be as impressed - LOS is not exactly that kind of Thai restaurant)."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST VISIT for anyone hungry in Vegas.

I read the reviews and decided to try it.  My husband and I love Thai food, and this place totally did not disappoint!  It was soooo good!  The food was excellent. We had

- Tom yum
- Tom kha
- Ginger Chicken
- Pad Thai
- Mango with Sticky Rice

Everything was absolutely delicious!  I have never had Pad Thai like that - a little different than what I am used to, but it was unbelievably good!  Try it.  And, no matter how stuffed you are, get the mango with sticky rice!  It is the perfect ending.

When you go, be sure to ask to sit in Tony's section - he made the experience even that much better!  He was so helpful, always checking up on us.  And be sure to have him suggest some wine.

Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai place in Sin City.  Comparable to some of the Thai places you will find in SF.  Is it worth going to?  Yes and no.  If you are craving good Thai food and want to break up what you would normally find on the strip in Vegas, then yes.  It's cheap and good.  No in the sense that if you come from a place that has great Thai restuarants (like San Franscisco) it's good but not any different or better than what you can find back home."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out after hearing the buzz. Located in a remote strip mall it's a bit odd. Once inside, the staff are attentive and friendly. Fun decor inside. Service for lunch was fast and delicious. Had the garlic prawns and crispy duck with curry sauce. Both delicious and served fresh. Great execution. Check the menu before swinging by as they serve almost everything Thai here. Price point is high but if you can swing it, it's worth it. If you are looking to change up your Vegas trip with something new - try Lotus!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious Thai restaurant just off the Strip. Highly recommended by celebrity chefs. Came here hungry on a Friday night. We had no reservation. No problem. Seated immediately.

We ordered beef khao soi, seafood drunken noodles, moo yang, and tub wharn. Khao soi is one of my favorite dishes to eat and they do it great here. Nice and creamy coconut milk sauce with a little bit of heat. Not too thick. Not too runny. Plenty of crispy egg noodles that stayed crispy even when drenched in sauce. The tender beef and egg noodles soaked up all kinds of flavor. Perfect. Best khao soi.

The moo yang was very, very tender. Loved it. Our meal at Lotus of Siam was convenient, affordable, comfortable, and had bold flavors. Worthy of full marks."}
{"text":"Well it's not the fanciest spot in Vegas. It's off the strip in a strip mall. The strip mall looked pretty interesting. Lots of Korean restaurants, a saloon, travel agency, billiards and karaoke. 

Anyway, this place is supposed to be pretty famous I guess...saw lots of celeb pics on wall and voted best Thai food in America or something. I had the lunch buffet which was only $8.99. Not a bad deal for unlimited pad thai, chicken curry, eggrolls, sauteed veggies, couple different soups, fruits, etc, etc. Honestly though, I wouldn't call it the best Thai food I've had. I think L.A. has a lot of good places already. I'm spoiled with all the great restaurants in L.A. But ya know...the service was pleasant here and it was kinda nice eating at a restaurant off the strip...away from all the chaos. Maybe I'll try something on the regular menu next time."}
{"text":"This place is under construction and isn't open for a few months. They need to update their marketing to let customers know."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been too. Server was amazing! Food was outstanding. The atmosphere of the joint was superb!!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We've had been looking forward to eating here for a long time but we live and work on the other side of the city so we waited for a special occasion. The wait was about 30 min since we didn't have a reservation but we took a seat at the bar and had a drink while we waited. 

We decided to try the khao soi with beef, the garlic pork spare ribs, crispy pork belly with peppers, and a couple other dishes. The khao soi is a must try. It has incredible flavor. The garlic pork spare ribs were my favorite. They had a crispy outside with a nice juicy inside. I enjoyed the chili lime fish sauce dip that it comes with. It adds a nice acidity that makes your mouth water. We now understand why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best Thai I've ever had. Try the Grilled catfish (believe it or not). Service and atmosphere are nothing special, but not too bad either."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy!

Run down strip mall with an adult day care facility right next door hard to believe the lotus of siam is one of the best seemingly great Thai restaurants in Vegas.

Don't take my word for it go there and look at all the celebrities that have eaten there like New York cities Momofuku's Dave Chang with Lotus's owner and chef Saipien Chutma just hanging on the bottom row as you enter to the left. 

I have eaten there several times and if you can ignore the outside the ambience inside since they remodel is clean, quaint, and slightly upward sit-down nice. 

Food is definitely above par. They have all Thai classics at a standard Thai restaurant price and trust me  you don't JUST come here for the pad Thai and Tom yum. 

Chef special are excellent! Crispy duck in curry woo and the must have---garlic prawns

(Skip this if you don't want to hear about prawns sooooo good) Garlic pawns pricey but worth a drive to Vegas. They shell giant prawns but leave the shells attached. Coat the shelled fish in batter of garlicky goodness (not too much garlic) Deep fried both shells and prawns in extreme intensity so it looks like you have double the shrimp. If you don't like fried yummy shells you may feel a tiny bit jiped but they throw cilantro and green onions to make up for it (jk) the whole thing is delicious and stays crispy for hours. Really. I checked. So delicious.

Overall it's what you expect from a Thai restaurant with a whole LOT you didn't expect. Like a very streamed lined staff. Food took a little time but the servers brought us appetizers, were always accessible, and were knowledgable to point out the water was filtered NOT tap. In a place that is always busy and with an award winning chef it is a culinary experience that is very worth it."}
{"text":"We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeño will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeño and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've had in a long time.  The stuffed chicken wings were awesome. The garlic prawns, outta this world.  The crispy duck, to die for.  Wasn't the biggest fan of the Tom yum soup. , I've heard a lot about this place and all good things. I would have to agree and will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"THe best.  Period!  No comparison.  Everything on the entire menu is amazing.  Make sure you call ahead for a reservation or you may end up waiting 2 hours.  The wait is worth it though."}
{"text":"With nearly 3000 reviews, there's not a lot I can add. 

I was there during CES week and it was mobbed. So I ended up getting takeout instead. Thankfully, that came pretty quick.  

And let's just say that medium equals hot. The Tom Yum soup was delicious and got all my senses flowing.  

Loved the drunken noodles as well. But I really enjoyed the chili dip was some fresh vegetables. A very unusual dish.  

So overall, a must-eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of the best thai restaurants in town if you love thai this is the spot to head to. Nothing like having some great German wines with spicy food!"}
{"text":"Go here now. Don't know why this isn't on everyone's Vegas list (maybe it is. The wait was over two hours on my visit). Crazy packed but you can eat your whole meal at the bar. Garlic prawns are a must! We also had ginger sea bass and drunken noodles. Dessert looked great but we were stuffed. No liquor license so hit the tiki bar down the street first"}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS! This place is seriously amazing. It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though.
They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy.
It's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake."}
{"text":"Best place for Thai in the entire valley!  Be sure to make reservations... and lock your car doors when you go in- not the greatest area, but once you walk through their door you forget where you are."}
{"text":"How can I put this frankly --- it's only the best Thai food I ever tasted in U.S..  Believe me, I had plenty of Thai food in NorCal, SoCal and NY.  

Upon checking out all the Yelp reviews, we decided that we need to get the best three dishes.  Between the two of us, we could only stuff ourselves so much.  LOL.   The three winners were (and they truly were!) the garlic shrimp, crispy duck kang soi and soft shell crab drunken noodles.

Did we make the best choice!  The magnificently jumbo prawns were delicious.  I couldn't decide if I like the shrimp itself more or the fried shrimp shell!   Yes, you can and should and need to eat the shell entirely which is fried separately from the shrimp meat.  That was my fave of the three incredible dishes.

The drunken noodles with the soft shell crab were delightfully cooked.  The crab is fresh and lightly battered.  The noodles are moist but not oily.  We can eat pretty darn spicy but decided to go with only 6/10 and it was perfect.  It was a bit spicy in the mouth without taking out the true flavor of the dish.

The last but certainly not the least dish was the duck kang soi.  The noodles below the crispy duck were soaked with the fat of the duck and the creamy yet light broth.  There were fried noodles on the side.  The combo of the three (duck, broth and noodles) gave it a nice complexity.

The prices are a bit steep and the total came out to be about $86.  But when you think about it, it is a very fair price to pay for the best Thai food I had in U.S.!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is not located in the most glamorous of locations, the food itself is just amazing and definitely worth a visit.  I have eaten both dinner and the lunch buffet here before, and it is always very good.  I even had a friend order some to-go, freeze it, and bring it back with him to Minnesota it was so good!"}
{"text":"GREAT wine selection! Food was okay. I don't eat seafood and the steak dish I ordered was fatty and tasted fishy/bad. The waiter was very gracious and took that meal off our bill (we didn't ask). We heard this was the best Thai place in Vegas, and perhaps our experience was just an off night."}
{"text":"Not much to look at but, jeez, great food!  Order the crispy rice and sour sausage to start, then the crispy duck in chu chee sauce, and garlic and pepper grilled shrimp.  

You'll probably need a reservation!"}
{"text":"Sawasdee Krup,
I HEART Lotus of Siam and you should too! Please don't write me a long and nasty e-mail if you don't and you got turned away at the door because you didn't make a reservation....dummy!  The place is popular and for good reason. The restaurant sits in this seedy location way off the strip. Don't let the run-down strip mall scare you away. It surely didn't scare off the likes of Oprah and President Clinton....THANK YOU VERY MUCH. It does seem odd that a restaurant with such fanfare is in this  hidden corner of 
Vegas, but I think thats part of the attraction. 

The food is truly gourment and the service is quick, not the warmest, but with food this good I'd suffer through an open-hand slap to the face for some more Tom Kah soup. Fresh & Spicy, like Padma on Top Chef!

NOTE: Take the time and call ahead for a reservation. I saw a lot of sad faces waiting in the lobby as we strolled in the door and right to our table D-list celebrity style.....Oh Yeah!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain's show \"Parts Unknown\" where we've actually found a couple restaurants we love . Beautiful restaurant and great food.  The Northern Thai is the way to go"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I simply cannot say enough about the quality of food. Their menu is immense but everything is of a very high quality. 

My favorite dishes thus far are the roast duck curry and the crispy duck drunken noodles (I am a sucker for duck). We've also had great success with multiple appetizers (BBQ chicken wings were great.....odd for a Thai place, I know) and soups. 

As others have said, the location is, um, interesting? Included at no charge are beggars in the parking lot. Don't let it scare you off though, the trip is beyond worth it."}
{"text":"I hate drinking water. I eat Thai food to make me drink water, in a sort of reverse psychology style. Its the art of getting food ridiculously hot but not so hot your ears start ringing. Green curry at a #7 was even a little excessive...four glasses of water and 2 diet cokes later, I still had Angelina Jolie lips (or felt like it) for a good 20 minutes after I was finished eating. However, my friend's #7 pad thai wasn't hardly hot at all. Chicken satay was good, although the peanut sauce was a little bland. Really good, affordable food"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, but SUPER WELL KNOWN! I have lived in Vegas for over a year, and a friend from home told me about it. It is off Sahara hidden in a shopping center. It looks tiny, but once you get inside - it's huge!

Food - You can't go wrong with anything you order. The best things that I have tried are the Garlic Prawn, the Pad Thai, and the Short Rib Panang. The prawns are deep fried, but they are delicious! You will see the person at the table to next you have them and NEED them! I always order Pad Thai, and I found my new go-to place to get it from. The short rib Panang is sweet, and the short rib is juicy. It absorbs the flavor and melts in your mouth. 

Ambiance - Always busy, but definitely worth the wait. You may want to call in at least a few days in advance to make a reservation to ensure you get a table, and don't have to wait."}
{"text":"we came here for dinner on fri night, and it was yummy.  we had a large group and my friend ordered ahead, b/c with such a large menu and 10 hungry girls, we knew it would be hard to decide what to get.

we got the seafood soup, prawns in red curry sauce, charboiled catfish on a bed of cabbage slaw, beef pad thai, and crab fried rice.  OMG, the crab fried rice was AMAZING and definitely the highlight of the meal.

we finished w/ the mango sticky rice, which was different from other ones i've tried in the past.  the sticky rice was fragrant w/ jasmine or something, but when we asked the server what it was that made it taste so good, he just said it was coconut milk.  the coconut ice cream served on the side was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food I've ever had! 

We arrived at 5:30pm at the time of opening and there was already a line forming. Do not take that as an exaggeration. If you want your taste of Lotus of Siam, get there early and throw elbows because this is a must-try! 

Among the two of us ladies, we ordered the garlic prawns, crispy duck with drunken noodles, and thum ka noon. This is excessive eating for two but we were on a mission to try as much as we can until our next Vegas trip. The garlic prawns were huge with the shells loosely hanging on its meat. The flavors were blatant and the meat texture was done with the right crisp. For $25, there were eight pieces to share. The crispy duck was deboned and casually sitting on top of a pile of juicy and sticky bed of drunken noodles. There is an assortment of green and red peppers in the pile hence making it a very exotic dish. The thum ka noon is ground pork with shredded Jackfruit. It was a very flavorful dish that would be a good complement with rice but we ran out of room for the carbs. 

Service and food delivis exceptionally good and quick. We sat down at 5:35pm and were on our way in exactly an hour."}
{"text":"Just to confirm other Yelps: Yes, it is difficult to find but if you drive around enough looking at all the strip malls contained in that square block, you will get there eventually. Reservations are needed if you don't want to wait. Service was impeccable. The last bite taken from our dishes was picked up within 10 seconds. Food was delivered so fast we waited 30 minutes before ordering entrees because the ticket times are 10 minutes or less. Ok, so the food left our table discussing what we loved everywhere else which I don't think is so good. We did the order consistent with Yelp: Khao Soi, Tom Kha, Garlic prawns, crispy duck panang and golden tofu. All the dishes were a meh. Our table discussed how they lacked that depth of flavor we look for and get at other spots less hyped. 

I would give the restaurant staff the highest rating possible but sadly the food didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"First I have to say, I hate giving bad reviews. If a restaurant is bad but I feel like they tried to accommodate the customer then I would just not review and let it be. However I have to stick to the 1 star for this restaurant and that is only because the food is good. 

I walked in at 7:50PM looking for a table for 2. It was well over an hour wait, which we were okay with, but after the hour had passed we had to physically go inside and fight for a table. Finally after being embarrassed and realizing that they had forgot about our party they gave us a table. Since it was late already and we knew what we wanted we ordered everything at once. Appetizer, entrée and drinks. We got our appetizers right off the bat and it was some delicious Tom Kah Gia. It however took us over an hour once again to get our food. by that time the soup had turned cold. When we complained to the manager he stated that they offset meals by 10 to 20 mins, but I fought back and told him that we ordered everything at one time, so there should be no reason why things are late. He apologized and said he would take care of us and would do everything he can to make us happy. I thought that maybe this meant a discount on the bill.

When the bill came it was full priced and no discount applied to anything. When I asked to see the manager one more time took about 20 mins for him to walk over to us and I had to remind the waiter multiple times to talk with manager, perhaps the worst customer service experience of my life. When he walked over I showed him the bill and asked what have you done to accommodate our hardships. He said \"oh yeah...\" and walked away. He then returned with some ice cream desert, but both me and my party were full and did not want dessert so he basically brought out something that was a complete waste, he should have just discounted the bill with the price of the ice cream. 

So in the end I walked in at 7:50PM left the restaurant at 10:30PM very upset at how the manager had handled the situation. I will not be returning to this restaurant and will warn people of the service here. I don't care how famous the place is or how good the food is, the management is destroying the hard work the cooks and everyone else puts forth. 

My previous experience was just the same, but they actually forgot to bring me an entrée I ordered, that was 2 years ago. I am sad to see that things have not changed much :("}
{"text":"Location aside the Thai food at this location is out of this world!  I am world travelled and this is the real deal, from the look of the place all their funding and thought goes into the food.  Would have been five stars however first impression almost turned me away."}
{"text":"Omg I am so in love with this place. Located in a near-abandoned strip mall off the strip, my boyfriend and I got here for an early dinner at 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm) and were very impressed that there was already a sizable line forming along the outside. We had high expectations, and Lotus of Siam did not disappoint.

We tried:
- Crispy duck with panang ($20.95) - SO GOOOOD, I'M STILL DREAMING OF IT! I adore panang curry, and it is seriously done right here! We ordered mild because my boyfriend doesn't eat spicy, but it still came out a bit spicy. But even he LOVED this. While the crispy duck was delicious, I felt it was a little bit heavy for me with all the oil/frying. Next time, I would order this as the panang curry with beef or chicken ($10.95) and save myself the ten bucks.
- Crab Fried Rice ($12.95) - So delicious and flavorful. No skimping on crab whatsoever! Would order again forsure.
- Drunken Noodle Prawn ($22.95)- My least favorite dish of the night. I felt the large, flat noodles were bland. However, the prawn was crisp and plentiful. Instead, next time I'll try the Garlic Prawn ($21.95) instead.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable and helpful. My boyfriend and I had no idea what kind of wine we wanted (they have a HUGE selection!), but he asked us a few questions and brought us out each a glass perfectly suited to our individual tastes. Couldn't ask for a better experience - a definite must visit if you have the time to get off the strip while in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I was here in Vegas a few weeks ago with some friends, we decided to try this place. The wait was about 45 minute, the food was really good. When I opened the menu, everything looked and sound so appealing. We will definitely be back here again for Thai food. It is really really decious!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food I've ever had. Great service and amazing food make the 1 hr wait so worth it.  We try to go here everytime we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Located away from the strip. You decide if that's a good of bad thing. The neighborhood is really dumpy. The Green Door sex club is located nearby.  If you can get by all of that, then you will enjoy the best Thai food in Vegas. 
When you walk in and see all the normal looking people, you can relax.
I went with some people who order many different dishes so we could share. It was great!
The wine list should satisfy all.
Take a chance and go. Do you feel lucky?"}
{"text":"Don't let the look from outside fool you. It looks much better inside. Apart from the tiny entrance, this place is actually huge and clean. Food quality is  great, however it come in small quantities compare to other Thai restaurants. Thai Ice Tea and Ice Coffee also great, too."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place because of its reputation being \"the BEST\" Thai food in Vegas and having a James Beard award.

Unfortunately, the experience fell short for us. I encourage everyone to really LOOK at the food photos and the presentation. The food is OK. It's OK/average but not great.

What we had:
1. Meatless shrimp rolls (fried). OK, nothing to write home about.
2. Wonton Soup (cup) - very nice chicken dumplings nice light flavor. Veggies in soup were disappointing.
3. Crab Salad - crab was battered and deep fried but it was not melt in your mouth, perfectly soft yet crunchy as a good crab salad should be. The accompanying vegetables were perfect and a beautiful combination. It saved this dish.
4. Sweet and sour chicken (for my kids) - Awful. Sauce was too sweet, pineapples looked like they were canned, white meat chicken were morsels not slices. Disaster.
5. Red Tofu Curry - Flavor was again just OK, not amazing. We've had much better.
6. Fried Banana, Cocunut ice cream, sticky rice - The fried banana was like an egg roll with banana inside. Very typical but good. The coconut ice cream was a disappointment. The sticky rice tasted old and consistency was not sticky. it felt like frozen sticky rice that was thawed. Completely awful.

To me this restaurant is like \"Americanized\" Thai food.

Overall, I would not recommend this place. Plus it's pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto and we have a few Thai restaurants but this place is just special. It's been a year since we've gone to Lotus of Siam and we are STILL talking about it. This made our trip to Vegas and we want to go back just to eat here. Fellow foodies, I know you get it. We had the bass drunken noodles (DROOL), crispy garlic shrimp (OMG YES) and a few other items I don't remember the names of. Everything was so good!

I would highly recommend you check this place out and so you're not stuck waiting, make a couple of reservations so you can go back more than once if you're visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"No no and NO. 

While yes, the authenticity of the Thai food served is authentic and tasty. The price for the portions served along with the service are not. 

Overpriced with small portions and a server stealing your change is NO GO for me. 
Simply put, I've been to authentic Thai places that serve more food and at half the price. I'll admit it might not be AS good as Lotus of Siam, but for those that aren't foodies or even tasted authentic Thai food, you won't ACTUALLY notice the difference except for the hype. 

18% gratuity is automatically added for large parties.
Though I don't necessarily agree with this, if the service is at least decent I won't complain. 

However, if they don't return the change (even if it were only $3) after an automatically added tip, this is absurd. 

As a bonus, after our waiter took the check, he ignored my table for 10-15 minutes until I gave up and left. I was with a big party and needed to leave. 

STAY AWAY. There are so many better places to spend your money at in Vegas and THIS IS NOT IT."}
{"text":"I researched Thai restaurants in Vegas before our trip from San Jose, CA. When we drove into the shopping center, we were wondering what we had gotten ourselves into. It was located in a strip mall which looked pretty deserted. We had also looked up Komol, which is right across from Lotus of Siam, but were intrigued by the reviews of this place. The place is not impressive looking from the outside, but when you step inside...totally different! We happened to come by when Las Vegas Magazine was there doing a review, which was pretty cool to see. I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum (spicy vegetable soup) which was good! It's rare to find this in a cup size, so I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the Vegetarian Drunken Noodle, which isn't on the menu, but asked that it be made as I am a vegetarian. I mentioned to the waiter that we had read awesome reviews from yelp and that we were from California. A few minutes later, an appetizer comes to our table...compliments of the manager. It was the veggie version of their \"Nam Kao Tod\" and it had tofu in it instead. The flavor was amazing, the lime juice brought out the flavors in the dish so well! Then, the manager brought over 2 glasses of wine to taste with the appetizer and he paired them nicely! When the main dish arrived (Veggie Drunken Noodle), I was practically full already. The dish had amazing color to it (please see my pic's of this dish in the photos above) with lots of tofu, FRESH veggies, and noodles. It was the BEST drunken noodle dish I've ever tasted. The service at this place was OUTSTANDING and we also noticed that the people dining behind us received the same service as well. We opted for the Sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert. OMG!!! My mouth is watering thinking about this delicious dessert. The coconut was so soft and young, and the rice was the perfect addition to compliment this. Again, 2 more glasses of wine appear and this time, it's my absolute favorite dessert wine, Muscato d'Asti. When the bill came, NO charge for the appetizer or the wine! The manager came over to our table and was incredibly gracious and a true gentleman. When we walked outside, he ran after us to make sure we weren't going to be hailing a cab, as the location is pretty remote and no cab's were in sight. We had a rental car, so we were set. Talk about going that extra mile! When we asked him how his competition was across the way (Komol is another Thai restaurant in the same lot), not one bad thing came out of his mouth and he said \"No, we don't compete with other restaurants, we like that we're a small place.\" How cool was that? My friend and I vowed that every time we go to Vegas, we will definitely come back to this gem of a place. For anyone who loves Thai, ya gotta check it out when you're in Vegas. Thanks for a great lunch Lotus of Siam!!!!!

P.S...The pictures on the wall have many celebrities as well as chef's from the major restaurants located on the strip....that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW All I can say is wow. I've had authentic Thai food before in Thailand but to be honest, this kicks it right of the the waters. If you read a lot of reviews you know about their Garlic Prawns. ORDER TWO PLATES! Especially if you are sharing with others because this will go out fast! Another favorite is the Peking Duck curry. More of Duck in curry sauce than curry but this dish gave me heart eyes. Skip out on the basic dishes such as pad see ew because you can get that anywhere. Also the walls of celebrities made me feel like this was a definite good choice."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam was a disappointment for my wife and I on our recent visit there. My wife had been to Lotus several times and enjoyed her experiences. This was my first visit.

The food was average. The service was average. The atmosphere seemed in need of a remodel. 

Neither of us anticipate a return to Lotus of Siam, unless there are some steps taken to refresh or renew the restaurant, as well as improved customer service. 

We are locals."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Las Vegas for nearly a decade now, and I started to hear rave reviews for Lotus of Siam on my second or third trip.  I love Thai food, but didn't get a chance to dine here until we had a car to drive off-Strip to the back of a sketchy strip mall.  I wasn't put off by the location (I love a good dive), but it didn't seem like somewhere I really wanted to catch a cab.

We visited at lunchtime, tired and hungry from early-morning flights, and decided to hit the buffet.  I think this was our critical error.  The majority of the 5-star reviews here are for their menu service, not the buffet.  But we were starving and the limited options on the buffet seemed like a reasonable trade-off for instant gratification.  I wish we'd looked at the buffet before agreeing to be seated in the dining area around it - one glance and I think we would've opted for the menu dining room instead.

It was a small buffet and very little on it was Thai cuisine.  Mostly, it offered the typical Pan-Asian dishes you find on cheap buffets - rice, lots of stir-fried veggies and meats, some noodles, some broth-y soups, sliced fruit, crispy fried appetizer things, etc.  The Pad Thai and a veggie dish were the only recognizably \"Thai\" dishes out there, the rest were pretty uninteresting.  Nothing seemed particularly well-made or seasoned, either.  The highlight of the buffet was the fried banana wontons.  We ate so many of those once we discovered how mediocre everything else was.  

I'm sad to give Lotus of Siam a 2-star review, but the buffet doesn't deserve anything higher even if you're dining in a room literally lined in photos of the celebrity guests who have dined there (and a gigantic glassed-in wine cellar, which was incongruous with the buffet).  I'd be interested to return for a real menu dining experience.  I don't often give second chances to places that let me down this badly, but I know I must be missing something here."}
{"text":"Service: terrible 

Wait: I expected one it was around an hour

Food: definitely not the best I have ever had. I had their version of beef jerky for an app as well as fried wantons. Those were both okay. Wantons were a bit over cooked but they were busy so I can look past that. For the main course I had chicken pad thi and I have eaten this all over the world many times and I can honestly say this wasn't the best, it was just okay. Over all it was a good meal. Nothing special like it's hyped up to be maybe I didn't try the right things.

Price: isn't to bad we had a weird charge in our bill they said it was because we added shrimp to one of the pad thi meals but there was already a charge for that on the receipt plus this additional charge that just said the world special. So  be mindful of what your are paying for. Their explanation was very confusing and they ended up saying they charge you twice when you order shrimp. Why not put it all on the same line? 

Needles to say if you want to go here then go. I looked forward to it for months after we booked our trip to Vegas. I was honestly let down but you could say that with anything your hype up and look forward to for months. You can find better restaurants in other areas of Vegas. But if you really want to go here don't let this review stop you but personally I will not be going back and my boyfriend has also cancelled plans to go back here on a future business trip."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me forever to try this place. I finally made it back to Vegas for the upteenth time and remembered the review from Anthony Bourdain and recommendations from Zagat and Bon Appetite to try the northern style Thai food. Being new, our waitress made thoughtful suggestions as to what we should try. 

* Khao Soi - Crispy duck served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry sauce. This was the only true northern dish but it was the BEST dish ever!
* Nam Kao Tod - Crispy rice mixed with pork, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, and lime juice. Normally with crushed peanuts but since I'm not a fan of nuts, I had them make it without.
* Papaya salad - green papaya, chili, tomato,mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. Again, no nuts please.
* Yum woon sen - Cellophane noodles, onions, with shrimp mixed with chili and lime juice served over a bed of greens. Tasty!

It's impossible for me to enjoy super spicy Thai food but I don't mind a small taste of it. Everything was ordered mild if possible.

Plan on trying something different. Go beyond the usual and please don't order the pad Thai. It might be good but after looking around, I noticed that there are so many other outstanding dishes.  Don't let the strip mall location deter you from visiting either. The food is fresh and it's huge inside. There's plenty of parking and they have an unbelievable selection of Riesling

This is one of the few places I can truly recommend for Thai outside of LA. It's that good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food we've had in the states!  We weren't sure this place would live up to the hype, but it absolutely did.  We came 10-min after it opened on a Saturday night, and already there was an hour wait.  We debated if we should stay, but since it was still pretty early we decided to wait it out.  Tip #1 - Don't be like us.  Make a RESERVATION.

In the waiting area, there are laminated articles and accolades plastered from wall-to-wall.  They've won so many James Beard awards, and have been named THE best Thai restaurant in the country.  High praise!

We only wished that we came with a large group of people so we could try more dishes, but since we had an hour to kill we had plenty of time to decide what to get.   It took us forever to settle on a few dishes because everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would recommend trying stuff that's from Issan, Northern Thailand, or Chef's choice because c'mon... you can get Pad See Ew and Pad Thai anywhere.   

This is what we ordered:
-  A cup of Tom Yum Koong soup
-  A cup of Tom Kah Kai soup
-  Shrimp in a blanket (shrimp wrapped with bacon and wonton wrappers then deep fried).  
-  Crispy duck with Panang Curry
-  Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles

Everything was DELICIOUS.  My favorites were the soups and soft shell crab with drunken noodles.  The depth of flavor they were able to infuse into the soups really made them memorable.  You could taste all the wonderful flavors of Thailand in those little cups - lemongrass, lime, chili, etc.  Mmm... 

The soft shell crab was perfectly fried and layered beautifully atop the flat noodles (like the ones they use for Pad See Ew).  There were so many popping flavors that the dish still danced on my tongue hours after we had eaten.  I highly recommend this dish!

I was least impressed by the Crispy Duck Panang Curry even though it was still good.  I think I like really unique, bold flavors and the red panang curry tasted pretty similar to other Thai places.  The deep fried duck was good, but nothing beats Chinese peking duck - I couldn't help but compare.

Can't wait to come back again.  This place is a must try for those who enjoy Thai food!"}
{"text":"Let's go ahead and be honest here... Lotus of Siam is easily the best Thai restaurant in the states.

My dad introduced me to this restaurant during our last trip to Vegas. The restaurant had a line outside of it even before it opened- proof that they're doing something right.

A few of the things we ordered-

Issan style beef jerky (delicious, not like the stuff in the bag at the gas station, but REAL, spicy beef jerky)
Panang short ribs (spicy and perfect, the best Panang sauce I've ever had)
Sea bass over drunken noodles (my favorite)
Fried banana and mango with sticky rice (must try- I didn't try the coconut ice cream but it looked delicious).

Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good thing about this place.  All my friends from out of town love this place because this is the first place we hit when they are in town."}
{"text":"If you're going to take anything away from any review here, take this:

AMAZING WINE LIST

This place was rated the top Thai place in the country. While I wouldn't necessarily go that far, it's absolutely excellent. The food is well prepared, you can order it as mild as a \"1\" and as hot as a \"10.\"

I was told that this place is frequented by chefs and restaurateurs alike in Las Vegas, and they liked it so much that they handpicked a wine list for it.

While I was \"boring\" and went with a pad thai, I was very satisfied. I got it as a \"6\" and my mouth was burning. We paired a sweet riesling with dinner and it was excellent. 

Here's the standard review cliff notes for this place: Located in a seedy strip mall, amazing bang for the buck, great wine, great food. Great for locals and foodies, but will most likely never be found by the standard tourist."}
{"text":"Top Chef Masters definitely gave me high expectations. Yup, Lorena Garcia, I have one brow raised at you right now. 

I gave in to the hype and put it on my \"Places to Eat At\" list when I recently went to Vegas. Mind you, I was with my family and, my step mom is Thai. I thought it would give me bonus stepdaughter points so I was pretty excited to bring her to Lotus of Siam. 

The Crispy Catfish Salad was great! The catfish pieces were fried crispy perfection and the salad tasted light to me. The dressing wasn't too salty nor too sour. I definitely loved it and was excited to have our other orders come out. 

The food sure did start to come out one by one and sadly, I got disappointed. I don't know if it was because maybe what we ordered weren't their \"stellar\" dishes but oh, boy. I wasn't a happy camper. We got the Tom Yum Goong, Panang Curry, Pad Thai and my dad got an extra bowl of noodles in soup with meatball type things floating. 

I'm sorry, but my go-to spot in Thai Town in L.A. does a better job at preparing what I had ordered. That Tom Yum Goong was just pure sourness with no kick whatsoever (my stepmom asked them to make it spicy in Thai). The Panang and Pad Thai were both on the sweeter side as well. My stepmom agreed to what I had to say as well and, she's a straight-up, legit Thai lady herself. I only have the privilege of saying that I've been to Thailand but she's got it all in her blood. Her opinion has to count as something, right?

I'm not ready to cross them out my list just yet. Everyone definitely deserves a second chance and I could have made a mistake in ordering Thai staples but, that's what scares me too. If the staples aren't even close to amazing then what more the dishes they're known for? I guess I'll just have to wait and see."}
{"text":"A long time customer of Lotus. This past Friday I went for the lunch buffet by myself. A 20 minute wait no problem.  My disappointment was the wait staff.  No water or beverage was offered.  I finally got up and took a glass from a water station and helped myself.  The buffer while ok was not monitored and refilled timely.  I made two separate trip 15 min apart for the green chicken curry. Neither time was it refilled. Just a few sad pieces of zucchini floating in sauce.  The same applied to the tempera.  Staff did not acknowledge me or two other tables.  When I went to pay I told the cashier and she said with no concern we are busy.  I said hire more help. You can afford it.  I'll be skipping lunch at Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. 
The Nam Kao Tod (crispy fried rice) was unique and delicious. 
The Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle was also very good. 
Despite the reputation and the line out the door, the service is friendly. 
If you like Thai food, this is a \"must.\""}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, very popular so it may be difficult to get seated. Reservations recommended.

Higher end dining compared to most Thai restaurants I've encountered in the US. Prices reflect this, though, but quality is high, no question.

Extensive menu with all the usual expected choices as well as many others. You'll easily find something you'll want to try.

Staff is friendly and attentive. I'd go back, but I'm also quite happy with my local favorites in my hometown. But when in Vegas..."}
{"text":"O-M-G everything at this place is so freaking good.  I would arrive here at least 15 minutes before opening time for dinner.  Even with that, there were already 10+ people ahead of us in line.  The restaurant is pretty big but fills up fast.  

My favorites were the duck curry, garlic prawns, and drunken noodle with soft shell crab.  The other dishes were also fantastic but I was actually coming down with the flu when I ate here but it was still worth it.  Get the prawns though; they're big, succulent, and fresh.  

The menu is so large that you can come back again, and again, and again and still order a completely new spread each time.   There's even a Northern Thai section with dishes that have a Burmese influence.  If you're staying on the strip, I would make the extra trek out here.  

Also, something random but the whole place smells like salonpas.  Makes it legit."}
{"text":"Simply the best THAI that I've ever eaten. The neighborhood is kind of seedy but the food will keep you coming back for more. Do not be turned off because it's not on THE STRIP. Give them a try, yo will not be disappointed. May I suggest the GARLIC PRAWNS...They're so good you will eat the shells."}
{"text":"Always awesome!  New location is much nicer, about time! Everything is delicious from the papaya salad to the garlic prawns!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to go to Lotus of Siam for years given its reputation. It is in a strip mall and seemed to be a lot of tourists. We got there a little early for our reservation. Waited a few minutes at the bar and were seated. The place is much larger than you'd expect. And packed, so make a reservation. 

The food was really good. Not the best Thai food I've ever had. But most was great. The stuffed chicken wing is say skip. The papaya salad was really good. The larb, one of my favorite Thai dishes usually, was spicy. You can actually pick your spice on some dishes, we went with 7 of 10, which we was spicy enough. Any more and you're asking for pain. The curry was tasty but we were full by then. The crispy prawn dish was huge and awesome. Not cheap but not pricey either. 

I'd recommend coming here for a respite from the strip. Very good food. And fun. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the US? Well, I don't know about that but the menu and food is quite impressive. It probably was the best Thai menu I\"ve seen. I had the Thai spaghetti and it was awesome! I wish I could of tried so many other items. The place from the road, looks boarded up and closed. It seems and looks like a Dump! But make no mistake, his place seems to have a huge following and their service is TOP Notch too. I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Tom Yam soup was good. Prawn were so tasty.
Every dish was not expensive. Yum Wunsen (Spicy glass noodle salad) was very spicy.
Its so popular restaurant, so reservation is highly recommended.

{"text":"This place definitely did NOT disappoint! What we ordered the first time:

1.) Garlic Prawns- To die for! This is a must order- EVERY SINGLE TIME!
2.) Red Chili Paste with Veggies- YUM! I would go with #6 spicyness...just the right amount. 
3.) Crispy Duck Penang Curry- It was heavenly! Another must order dish!
4.) Seabass Drunken Noodles- It was good but I can go with out. I would rather try something else.

Every time we are in Vegas....we always come back to Lotus of Siam and it's always amazing. 

Advice: ALWAYS Make reservations!!"}

Oh & fantastic Rieslings!"}

{"text":"Best thai food i've ever had. I just left the place and i already want to go back. The service is good and fast. Can't wait to be hungry again so i can eat more."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends, my spouse and my son.  Was waiting to be \"blown away\"  and \"wow-ed\" by the food, and I was not.

But then, after 3 or 4 forkfuls (chopsticks not available--Thais don't use them), I realized that it really WAS good.  Not \"out of this world\", but darned good!  Fresh, high quality ingredients, DONE WELL.  Very nicely done.  Very tasty.

Wine and beer menu was awesome.  If you stop in the lobby you can see the many \"honorable mentions\" and articles about them in magazines such as Food and Wine, Gourmet, Los Angeles Food, etc.  They have won two James Beard awards.

Trying to find the place-- we are tourists in Vegas-- we drove to the address in our rental car, and it looked like a place that NO ONE would dare enter... vacant, dirty, abandoned and horrible.  But alas, that was the back way.  The front is not much better, actually.  But it is in a strip mall (off the \"Strip\") with Japanese, Indian, Mexican and Karoake restaurants nearby.

Phad See Ew, Phad Thai, Calamari salad, were fabulous as was Thai shrimp soup, the crispy rice appetizer, and geez-- I forget what else we had-- 9 dishes in all.  But it was darned good.  A nice place to get away from the glitz and high prices of the Strip.   Nice, even service.  Atmosphere pleasant.

Photos on the walls of celebrities who have eaten here.  I do see why.. it really does do Thai food very very well.  Worth going off the Strip for a \"real meal\"."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is good ... and probably great if you don't live in a major city or metropolitan area where good Thai food is accessible.  But it is overhyped and I don't think is really worth the drive out here unless you really don't have a good Thai place in your hometown.  I can name 3 in the Bay Area I think are just as good and or better, and two in the DC metro area that are up there too (places I used to live so there are more out there obviously).

Got here on a Saturday by 5:30 and there were a lot of people already here.  There was a large party that ordered a ton of food, so it took us about 30 minutes for me to get my cup of Tom Kha Khai.  It's good, but it tasted A LOT like plain ol' Tom Yum Soup with cream in it.  So it wasn't as special as I thought it would be.  Around 6:20, twenty minutes after my soup arrived, my entrees still weren't coming, and I had to catch a show at 7pm so we asked for it to go.  They were pretty quick after I asked for it to go, and extremely nice about it.  

We got the crispy duck with drunken noodles.  The crispy duck was very very good, but the drunken noodles were just meh.  I liked the chilis and peppers the crispy duck was fried with.  It reminds me of crispy fried pork chops at Chinese restaurants with the chilis, but it had this special brown sauce on it that made it sweet and extra good.  We also got the Khao Soi.  This was my favorite dish, but the portion was too small!

We also got Pad See Ew which was standard, and Massaman Curry which was good, but I actually felt was below standard.  I definitely didn't like that the potatoes were undercooked, and that there were boiled grape tomatoes in it.  My boyfriend also ordered chicken dumplings which were ALL RIGHT.  They were so tiny and it was $6 for 6 tiny ass little dumplings.  All in All we spent over $90 for thsi meal and thought it was kind of expensive, especially when we thought of our favorite Thai places from our hometown.  I think you can skip it if you've had good Thai food before.  The food on the strip isn't THAT terrible that you need to cab out here."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had! It was a little difficult finding the place, but I'm so glad I had the patience to look for it and eventually dine there. My college town had about 5-6 Thai restaurant, which I have dined at so I know good Thai food when I taste it. This is a definite winner. I order the pad thai noodles, rice, and red curry...really delicious.

I've been here only once and will go again and if this place is consistent, then I will definitely upgrade my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I chose this spot for my employee Christmas dinner  this year. We had about 20 people and I made a reservation a couple weeks in advance as I heard that this place is really popular. It was great! The atmosphere was fun and lively and all of my friends had a great time. The wine list was absolutely amazing! They had something like 500 varieties of wine! The best of all was the food! It was delicious! We ordered Tom Kai soup, pad thai noodles, basil chicken, fried rice and a bunch of appetizers. I can honestly say this is the best Thai food I've had in Vegas. If you want to eat here make sure you make a reservation because there is typically a line out the door before they even open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Being a 30 year resident of Las Vegas, and a foodie, I finally went to Lotus of Siam, which is arguably the best Thai restaurant in North America. Make reservations if you don't want to wait, but even if you wait, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I say don't be fooled by the area that this restaurant in, because in this case, looks can really be deceiving. 

You wouldn't think a nice restaurant would exist in the area this place is in. The outside looks like it's a subpar restaurant, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised, or at least I was. 

The menu has a vast selection of Thai dishes to choose from. I was slightly bit overwhelmed, but I wanted curry, and they have a dedicated section for curry. A few seem like the same but under a different name, but I'm not very experienced with Thai food. 

I ordered the musaman curry and I admit it was tasty. I could taste the coconut and it blended really well, especially when topped on white rice. The meat reminded me of Vietnamese beef stew and it was quite delicious. It came with a few pieces of potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. I wasn't very impressed with the amount of food I was given and my table was given. We all were surprised at the amount of food we were given with the amount the food is. The $12 curry had the portion size of something $8, but I guess when it comes to quality, you can't argue right? I wouldn't mind coming back, but this wouldn't be my first choice for Thai food"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Thai food in Las Vegas! Noodle dishes and fried rice are top notch, and don't forget the Thai iced tea. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best thai ever!! Fresh tasty authentic thai! Amazing service. My hubby and I have to come every time we visit Vegas! No disappointments ever."}
{"text":"Orderd the drunken shrimp noodles, the pad thai, the Nam Kao Tod.

The num kao tod is amazing. It has so many interesting flavors. The acid is a bit strong at first; but as it subsides you'll see that you can't stop eating it as you discover more and more different flavors: the cilantro, mint, lemon, the crunchy ricelike, etc.

The drunken noodles with shrimp is an amazing dish. It comes with several fried crunchy prawns and this flat noodle that's been cooked and has so many different flavors: sweet, salty, umami, etc."}
{"text":"i love this place, i love everything about it...
the food is amazing
the servers are nice
the seating is comfy
the wine cooler is cool ;)
but, the prices!!!!! why do they keep going up? this is not cool."}
{"text":"The BEST thai in LAS VEGAS, this place is amazing.. It is a bit overcrowded but man was the wait worth it... The service was excellent and the food was delicious!  Crispy Duck curry was very good.. It still had the crispy skin taste and hold it flavor even with the beautiful curry taste... The Tom Yum soups are amazing with very good spice.. I should've order for myself instead of sharing-HaHaHa :D but come here if your looking for a good time.. They serve beer,sake, and many selection of wine... :D enjoy! Because you will when you come here to dine..."}
{"text":"World class. 

This is by far the finest Thai restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of dining at. The food is superlative, the service excellent, the prices reasonable. They also have an absolutely shocking wine cellar. 

The quality of this restaurant and the location make for a humorous juxstaposition. As others have stated, it's located in a shady, desolate, mostly-empty strip mall, but I've never felt unsafe there. 

Try the crispy rice appetizer. It's astonishingly good."}
{"text":"Don't exactly get the hype. Food is horrible, service and staff are awful. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good and worth the trip off the strip.  Northern Thai cuisine and cheaper than almost anything you'll find in Vegas"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has an extensive menu of excellently prepared and authentic Thai food. It was some of the most delicious Thai food that I've eaten, on par with what I had at great restaurants in Thailand and at Pok Pok in PDX. We had the crispy duck panang curry and the phad kee mao with fried soft shelled crab - both were excellent and interesting with those proteins. Prices are reasonable, service is good.

We stopped in for an early dinner, arriving at 5:30 when they opened and there was already a but of a line. By the time we had finished our meal, there was a 40 minute wait for 2-tops. Go early or make reservations!

Great Thai food!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. A hole in the wall appearance from outside, but nothing but amazing awaits inside. Not only is the food absolutely perfect and delectable,  but the overall environment is great. Our waiter was fantastic and really helped out someone at our table with a food allergy, suggestions to avoid the allergy, and heads up when something may have been an issue. Also, the other waiters willingness to help each other out was a great sight. Amazing service. Impeccable food. Will always come back when in vegas. Kudos to this biz and all who help to make it what it is."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST Thai food ever!! 

bold words but very true and with good reasons. This place is too amazing to describe. HUGE menu with lots of authentic Thai options to choose from. So far I've had 8 dishes and they were all perfect. Great flavors, impeccable texture and authentic. I recommend to start with the Spicy Thai beef salad because it is ridiculously flavorful.

Maybe not the best deal in Vegas but certainly one of the best things in Vegas. We make sure to come here at the end of our trip and it never fails to be a good end to any Vegas weekend. 

I say avoid the buffet because trying items on the menu will be more rewarding. Trust me when I say the 30 to 45 mins wait is worth it."}
{"text":"The sauces alone would keep me coming back to Lotus of Siam.  I dined with 2 other people and we ordered about 6 or 7 different dishes to try everything, consisting of: the Papaya salad, the Mushroom salad, Pad See Ew, Larb, a Fish dish, and a few other small dishes.  All were delicious and none tasted the same, all uniquely flavored and seasoned.  

My main complaint would be how long the meal lasted.  This may be a Thai cuisine type of complaint, but the food came out so quickly that the meal only lasted about 45 minutes.  When dining out at a nicer place, I like to spend time to savor the meal and conversate.  Lotus of Siam cooks everything to perfection, but very quickly.  Beware if you're looking to spend the night out at Lotus, if so, it will be a very short night.

Pro tip: make a reservation.  They are very strict about showing up on time, but we were seated immediately, while we saw at least 4 parties waiting in line behind us.  Overall, a delicious and great meal"}
{"text":"Damn. Literally the best food I've had in Vegas so far, and I've been there 4 times and eaten at 2 Michelin star restaurants on/around the Las Vegas strip. I first heard about this restaurant when I was looking for a place to eat something Asian and not-so-expensive in Vegas. I think this place was rated the #1 Thai place in America, and it certainly deserves that title. 

I will eat here every time I go to Vegas. The first time, we got the dry curried pork on glass noodles (I think), and the crispy duck. The second time, we got the crispy duck, chilean bass on drunken noodles, and the garlic prawns. I'm not a great writer so I'm not sure if I even have the words to describe how much happiness this restaurant has caused me. But just trust me. Everyone going to Vegas should skip the White Castle, the buffets (ok maybe not), the fancy steakhouses, the fancy sushi places, and make a beeline for this unassuming establishment in a very plain looking strip mall. Skip to the back of the menu where their special stuff is and expect to spend $20-30 per good dish to share with your friends over rice or some other side.

I try to tip well because the food is so good and the waiters that work here really earn their wages. Both times I've been here, they've been incredibly knowledgeable and excited about the food, and are very good at recommending things and dishes based on our preferences. The food also comes out decently fast and everyone who works here that we've run into has been attentive and very welcoming. 

This place is a must-try."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and am always in search of one to try. Saw this place on No Reservation with Anthony Bourdain so naturally I had to try it. Came last Friday for lunch. Was there right at 11AM to ensure we got a table. There was a line of about three other groups. The food was decent but the portions were on the small side. We ordered an appetizer that I thought was sausage but turned out to be just crispy rice. Not bad but not great. We then ordered crispy salted prawns, crispy duck curry and soft shelled crab drunken noodles. The duck curry was amazing! We all loved it. The prawns were equally impressive. They fry the prawns and shells separately by the way. So crispy and delicious! There was nothing special about the drunken noodles other than the crabs. I think I had such high expectations coming in that there was no way that it was realistic. I wouldn't say \"best Thai food in America\" as stated in Bourdain's show though."}
{"text":"When you're tired of the over-priced and over-hyped meals in Las Vegas, try this place.

Don't be scared by the look outside.  It's what's inside that counts, and the food is very well done.  The Northern Thai food menu is unlike anything you've run across in a Thai restaurant.  We had the jackfruit curry off that menu, and off the \"regular\" menu some charbroiled beef (the name of which escapes me; sorry).  

The food was excellent, the service prompt, the value outstanding... and the bathroom was oddly palatial!  :-)"}
{"text":"Now this place is on point!  The menu, the service, the wine list, the food is ALL Amazing! Seriously the only downside is the location! it's in a older , uninviting shopping center if you can get passed that, it is not to disappoint!"}
{"text":"Review #2565 of Lotus of Siam. It's that popular!

A little far off from the rest of the places you will visit during a trip to Vegas but worth the short drive.  It is located near Sarhara in a deserted shopping center near Downtown.  I don't see any other reason to drive out here other than to eat here.  Parking is simple with the huge lot and plenty of parking since this is the only place that seems lively...

There might be a wait if you come during a busy time.  We came around noon and had to wait for around 20 minutes...(even though there were open tables...)  But I think I understand why they did that.  Unfortunately, the kitchen is quick but not quick enough to meet the demand and having people wait in line might be better than having them wait for food.

So was Anthony Bourdain and all the other celebrities (pictures all around the restaurant) just joking or is this place the real deal?

Order the garlic prawns! At around $30, it is pricey for 7 pieces of prawns but it was the best dish we had.  Not overly garlic-y and cooked perfectly so to not burn the garlic.  The prawns are huge and butchered perfectly so that you can devour the entire prawn (shell and all).

Order the Nua Nam Tok (Beef Salad with crushed toasted rice).  The beef was moist and fattier than other Thai restaurants I have had this dish at.  The fat was the difference.  Even though I prefer lean meats, the fat made the beef tender and flavorful.  The sauce was salty, sour, and spicy at the same time with a mixture of greens and a slice of cabbage.

Skip the Crispy Duck with Drunken Noodles or just order the drunken noodles by itself.  The crispy duck wasn't that crispy with our duck fat still not fully rendered.  The duck was not worth the premium to make this dish around $30.  Without the fat rendered out, it was similar to BBQ duck from a Chinese BBQ place...  As for the noodles, they were fried well with a layer of sauce on them.  The portion was a bit small.   Might be bigger without the crispy duck.  Finish the noodle quickly or they start to clump together.

This place is worth the visit.  I want to try the other items on the menu since they specialize in Northern Thai cuisine.  Will be coming back for the garlic prawns.  Beware of the wait for a table and then the wait for your food but if you have the time, it's a must try.  Just ask the other 3000 reviewers."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Make sure to arrive on time and make reservations days in advance."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from Anthony Bourdain on his show. My husband and I love Thai food. We was very excited to try the best Thai food in America. 
I am Thai and live in DC area. I gonna say only ok Thai restaurant in DC area much better than that. Curry has too much coconut milk test.  

Service was ok and pricey."}
{"text":"Great food!  Best Thai in town.  Don't expect a very attentive staff.  Make sure you ask for everything you need in anticipation of not seeing your server for a bit.  The wine and beer list is extensive and reasonable. Don't be fooled be the outside of the building.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Once again a great experience just at a different location.  The new location is larger and much more open then the previous but one thing I will say is that I did feel like it lacked just a bit of the old charm I felt I experienced before. Just my opinion. 

Arrived as they opened with a 530 p.m. reservation. Greeted and immediately invited to sit and wait in their small lounge near the bar. Nice blue couches throughout to relax at. 5 minutes later we were seated. Service was just as good as I remember from my last visit. Efficient and might I say, very very attentive and prompt....\"well oiled machine\". 

To eat I ordered most of the same things from my first visit in a daring attempt at testing consistency. I will say overall I felt my first visit was better but still, nothing to complain about this time. Started with the stuffed chicken wings and Garlic Pepper chicken wings. Both full of flavor and the crunch on the stuffed chicken was amazing(highlight). A glass of wine followed by a glass of beer and one entree later I was at ease. 

For the Entree I ordered the Crispy Duck Penang...It was between this or my previous pick of Northern Larb. I'm so glad I tried it. The duck was perfectly cooked/crunchy and the curry I thought had a great balance of spice and sweetness. This place, even at its new locale remains a must visit every time I'm in Vegas. If you want authentic Thai. With an emphasis on Northern Thai. Stop by. Recommended. 

Also shout out to Carmel Road...Pinot noir"}
{"text":"I rarely have a 5 star moment but this was one. Having arrived to the sketchy(yes sketchy) lot that houses Lotus I waited very briefly outside for my 530 p.m. Reservation. When I walked in I was very surprised. Greeted and seated immediately. 

I assumed the food would be great since Anthony Bourdain brought me here. However the location was a lot nicer inside than I thought that it would be. I sampled several things from Spicy Wings, stuffed chicken wings, peppered chicken, crispy duck, to the Northern Larb. I loved every dish just as much as the last and that is rare for me. 

The stuffed chicken was the highlight of the night but the pleasant spice kick from the northern larb was also impressionable. I won't go to crazy on this review with descriptions but let me say. One of the best food experiences I have ever had. I will be back EVERY chance I'm in Vegas and have the opportunity. Thank you Anthony Bourdain and Jet Tila. Recommended."}
{"text":"Sadly, after 10 years of eating at Lotus, I have to give a negative review.  The crispy rice ordered at an 8 of 10 spice level was tepid, tasted premade with  a few chile pods tossed in for \"spice\".  The portions are smaller than they used to be and the attention to detail is just not there.  I came for two meals in three days with family and we all left disappointed.  In the past, I felt like food was cooked to order and to preference of spice.  No longer, plus the waiter dissed us when we said we really didn't think the food was to the quality we expected.  Oh Lotus, you used to be awesome.  Next time I will cheat on you with Komol."}
{"text":"Food is Northern Thai style and you can get things that you normally would not be able to get in other Thai restaurants. If you want Pad Thai, they have it but I would get something more adventurous. Tried the curry noodles, papaya salad, pork Hunglae curry, northern style sausage, and crispy rice salad. MY least favorite dish was the crispy rice salad but overall the food was very good, and just as good as the places I eat at in NYC. They have a ridiculous wine list, so if you are in the mood for wine, take a look at the list."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've ever been, and I've been to quite a few. Gets crowded on weekends and evenings, but they do take reservations. Not cheap and not huge portions, but taste and quality are outstanding. Great wine menu as well.
Papaya Salad, Garlic Prawns (shells fried crispy like chips) and Short Rib Penang are our favorites."}
{"text":"Finally got to experience the magic.  Great and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Saw this place from Anthony bourdain's tv
Show. Place was packed on a Thursday afternoon. Got seated right away, avoided the buffet, went straight for garlic prawns and the back menu. Husband at a spicy curry with extra rice and I decided to go for the drunken shift shell crab. DELISH! Thai ice tea was amazing too. Now I see why this place has good reviews, authentic thai food made with amazing spices. Portions were large, and service was nothing to complain about. Just thought it was in a weird strip mall location. Def worth a shot if you're in Vegas and like thai food."}
{"text":"If you come to Las Vegas you have to veer off of the strip and come to a small little \"hole in the  wall\" like this one!!! 
The food is very authentic and has so much flavor!!! Off course non strip prices ranging from appetizers that we ordered were 8.95 and the crispy duck in curry was about $27! The duck was good but not extraordinary to where I'll come back just for that but I have to say it was good! Didn't have enough room for dessert but from what I saw they looked enticing! Overall great good and best of all because apparently Anthony Bourdain ate here and said it was good so I agree it was quite delicious!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype - this place is spectacular! I discovered my absolutely favorite duck dish (crispy duck w/ panang curry) in the world here! The service is friendly, but a bit slow, so plan accordingly. We came for lunch, but I think it would be interesting and fun to have dinner here. For lunch, the front dining room is set up with the buffet. If you're in the larger (seems new remodeled) back dining room, you get a good view of their very impressive wine cellar. 

Only quibble: husband's superb drunken noodles with seafood had fake crab. HUGE pet peeve of mine and what prevents a perfect \"5 star\" for this place. It tastes nothing like real crab and adds nothing to a dish. I do not get this ingredient at all. Doesn't matter, we'll still be back!"}
{"text":"Like this place needs another 5 star review.  Lame I know.  But I will chime in.  This place has been built up to me for about 5 years, I love Thai food, I was expecting to be let down in some way.  

I wasn't.
The service, was spot on, it's food was phenomenal and interesting, not just your generic thai menu with pad see eu and 5 types of curry.  

We ordered a bottle of kabinett riesling, their wine list is ridiculous btw.  We had their crispy rice appetizer which might have been one of my favorite dishes ever.  We ordered their green chile dip, very spicy which we loved, served with crispy pig skins :)  Our entrees we had one of the crispy duck preparations, I forget which one, and a charbroiled prawn dish.  

I loved it so much I am taking my family there Sunday when they are in town.  I plan to order the crispy rice and try some new things, although that duck might have to be ordered again."}
{"text":"Great, great and more great. Started with green papaya salad. I asked for medium heat and it was plenty spicy. Tom yum shrimp soup was the best. Then I had pad Thai. Again ask for little spicy. It was perfect. I will go back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried several things, but the best two dishes we've tried are the garlic prawns and the khao soi. The garlic prawns were consistently good both times. The khao soi was much better during our first visit, with beef, versus the second time, with duck. We also tried the beef drunken noodles, nam kao tod, nam prik ong and beef pad se ew, but none of these were nearly as good as the garlic prawns and khao soi. Since they do take-out, we're tempted to just pick up the garlic prawns from this place and then stopping by to get the Peking duck bao, short rib grilled cheese and sesame noodles from nearby Fat Choy, if we venture to this portion of Las Vegas.

The garlic prawns are the best thing here. The meat of the prawn is almost entirely removed from the shell so that it is only attached to the shell at the tail. The entire prawn, shell and all, is then deep fried perfectly. The meat remains tender but the shell becomes the best shrimp chip you have ever had. The garlic prawns are great by themselves and seasoned very well, but the garlic sauce that they add on top make the prawns even better. There is an added bit of sweetness in the garlic sauce that is perfect.

The khao soi is essentially a coconut curry noodle dish. The first time we got it, we chose beef as the meat. We were initially hesitant about squeezing in the accompanying lime, but the waiter was kind enough to recommend that we try it that way. We were right to listen. The added acidity from the lime juice made the sweet, fatty coconut curry even better. The second time, we decided to try the crispy duck khao soi. Alas, the coconut curry was a bit off this time. It didn't have the initial wow that we experienced during the first trip here, even after squeezing in the lime juice. In addition, the amount of curry and noodles was also smaller than the beef khao soi. The duck was cooked well with a crispy skin, but the reason you are here is for the khao soi.

The other items we tried here were less successful. The drunken noodle (pad kee mao elsewhere) were very pedestrian and nowhere as good as the drunken noodles we have had in Los Angeles. Similarly, the pad se ew was also lackluster. It tasted like pad se ew, but it wasn't the best pad se ew you've ever had. The nam prik ong was also a bit disappointing. In essence, this is a tomato paste served with crudité and fried pork skin. There was nothing about the sauce that made it memorable, being just a tomato paste. The nam kao tod is crispy rice mixed with sausage, cilantro, lime juice, peanut and chilis. From the description, again, I would have expected something very bright and complex, but it was again fairly plain.

We would come back or just do take out for the garlic prawns and maybe the khao soi (but not the crispy duck version of it). Better yet, we would probably just pick up the garlic prawns here and then head over somewhere else to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a large group and service was excellent!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for the food alone.  Our orders were taken in a sequential fashion and we were able to split the checks by table.  We had a birthday celebrant and they even served the cake after the meal which was nice. Drinks were kept filled.   Some of the items that I sampled were the larb, garlic shrimp, crispy duck panang, fried rice, and pad see ew.  Everything tasted perfectly prepared with just the right spice and flavor.   Loved the food so much will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The thai food was very good here and would highly recommend this restaurant.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered the kao soi, pineapple fried rice, and drunken noodles. My favorite was the kao soi but the other dishes were good.  You need reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"First visit and was not disappointed. It's very busy with a wait time of 45 minutes for 3 people. I suggest that you call ahead for reservations if you know in advance that you will be dining here.

My friends and I ordered the crispy garlic shrimp which is a MUST ORDER. It was absolutely delicious! We also ordered the pad thai which was like your typical dish at most thai restaurants. The curry crispy duck was amazing. A must try as it is definitely something different from the usual curry duck. Lastly, the Northern Larb with Pork was ok, nothing really exciting about this dish. Overall, the flavors are all there and is no disappointment. The Thai tea is yummy - perfect with the right amount of sweetness and milk/cream."}
{"text":"The love is so real for Lotus. Expect to possibly wait to enjoy this thai hot-spot as they do not accept reservations, however, it will be well worth it. 

I have had a slew of items off their menu, and have never been steered wrong. The staff, food and experience are simply great! 

It is a trek for those who live in Las Vegas off the strip, but if you are looking for one of the best authentic thai restaurants, look no further. 

YUM."}
{"text":"Make reservations; wait in line; whatever you need to do; GET HERE. 
After years of foodie friends and yelpers telling me to get there I finally was able to make it happen, and the wait wasn't in vain; wow... sooo goood. 
We had the waitress order our food; just told her to bring out the more popular items. She didn't disappoint. 
Meal: Crispy Rice, Coconut Mushroom Chicken Soup, Lamb w/ Peppercorn, Ginger Sea Bass, Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns.
I'm not going to pretend to be good at describing these in detail but my top two are crispy rice and the coconut mushroom soup. Just unreal. I WILL be back next time I'm in Vegas. Just wow."}
{"text":"Great food. Worth the wait so plan in advance. (Waited 45 min)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Definitely make a reservation at least one month in advance. This place gets super packed!

We had the crispy rice appetizer, tom kah (chicken coconut curry) appetizer, panang crispy duck, and the garlic prawns. Prawns are hands down the best dish ever so highly recommended, followed by the chicken coconut curry."}
{"text":"Delicious wine, delicious food in a large, packed restaurant full of happy people.  Wow!  My husband and I loved our meal here.   We were advised to order from the North Thai menu, and stick to their specialties.  We didn't order any of the stuff we would normally order (green curry, pad thai, larb, etc).  Instead we went all adventure - the shrimp with the shell (yum and I don't eat shrimp!), the jackfruit and pork, the massumam curry (a muslim curry - so creamy and seasoned perfectly).  The nam tok... crispy and perfect.

I can't wait to get my butt back to Vegas for more Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai food this side of the Pacific. The Chef won James Beard awards and Wine Spectator Awards years in a row for good reason. I personally do not understand how this place can get any reviews below 5 stars, it is that good. And no, I do not know the owner or the workers there. 

Beware that the spiciness level is in Thai scale out of 10. Perhaps due to my Asian heritage, I like my food hot. So when I tried to order something at 8/10, the waiter looked at me like I had flowers growing out of my head. We ended up ordering 7/10 and still it was HOT.

The only drawback is the location. It seems like there's always a panhandler ready to confront you at the parking lot.

Overall my go to place to take out of towners."}
{"text":"It was our lucky day I guess. When we finally found this restaurant, there were a lot of people waiting around. 
-parking: there's a big parking lot, but the plaza is big, but the restaurant was not easy to find. There's no sign, we had to drive around the bank to find it. It was a Christmas Eve, a lot of restaurant closed early, fortunately this one was still open. 
-waiting: checked with the receptionist, we were told that we needed to await at least 45 minutes to an hour. What a bad news. Then we started reading the menu, and when we looked around the restaurant, there were some empty tables, we guessed those for reservation only. Within 20 minutes, we were told that there's a table for us. 
-crab fried rice: it was good, but it's kinda cold, not hot enough. The crab meat was there, the portion was small, and we had to drink a lot of liquid after that. 
-Khoi soi- it was basically the crispy duck with some egg noodles, the curry source was thick, the egg noodles on the bottom soaked up the source and became soft and thicker. It was ok, the most unacceptable thing was this dish was warm only, we didn't enjoy this warm dish at all, maybe it would be good if its hot enough. After a 5 minutes, this warm dish became a cold dish. It seems the pre made those in the kitchen and to make it serve faster to the customers. We didn't want those kind of food with a high price at all. 
- garlic shrimp-- it was the only dish that we enjoyed. The shrimps were fresh and the way they deep fried those was perfectly right. The shrimp serve with shell, so pay attention when you bite onto it. The garlic was there, we had to put the garlic onto the shrimp to enhance the flavor. 
-service: its was good, the serve knew the menu well. So he took the orders right away. 
The price for this Thai restaurant was not low, maybe they were on the TV show before and some celebrities came here to give them more reputation. But we don't care about those show off pictures, we just want our food made upon order to serve us with better food with thosepricey dishes"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, this place is incredible. Despite the high price of the crispy garlic prawns ($21), they were worth every cent. 

Everything was good, and I know that a stop will be made here on every Vegas trip hereafter."}
{"text":"Despite the front look of this restaurant the inside is big and it has a nice ambience. You might probably need to wait for your table but it didnt took that long despite they say the waiting is 30-45 mins. 
It get more crowded the later it get so you might consider coming early.
The food is delicious!!! It kinda have a slight different taste than normal thai restaurant but its definitely delicious. I love the duck red curry, the spicy chicken wing, the crab fried rice and the khoa soi sliced beef!!!"}
{"text":"You really can't judge a book by it's cover. The outside of this place is pretty scary but don't let that stop you. 

We came for their $10 lunch buffet. Drinks are not included but they do give refills and are really good about keeping your glass full.

There was pad thai, fried rice, chow mein, fried chicken wings, duck soup, egg drop soup, salad, fruit, egg rolls, banana rolls and a couple more items.

The selection is pretty limited and if you are looking for meat, you won't find it at the buffet but flavors were on point and for $10, I can't complain.

What I was really impressed with was the service. They are really attentive and friendly. Our glasses were always full and plates were taken away as soon as we were done with them. 

I heard the dishes off their regular menu is way better than the buffet. I will be back for that next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service here is unbelievable, literally the nicest people in the world working here. I wanted to just hug them all - but that's creepy. So I didn't. 

While I was seated & waiting on the meal a manager came by to ask what I ordered and she was just genuinely nice and a caring woman curious to see what everyone was in the mood for. I got the yellow chicken curry - it was so delicious! I was stuffed and even had some to go. UMMM AND THE TINY TO GO BOX WAS SOOOOO CUTE! Have you ever seen a 2x2x2 rice box? It was just so cute. I need them in my life. Everywhere. I'll come back just for those. 

The food came out so fast and the quality was top notch. I also tried the bacon wrapped & fried prawn appetizer, I loved them! 

I feel like the prices are fair.The setting and atmosphere is classy and beautiful. I've been looking forward to coming here for a while now, my boyfriend raved about the old location. 

Try this place out! There are endless options. I can't wait to go back and try the drunken noodle or some type of fun barbecue dish. I think that's what sets this place apart from others - the fact I yearn to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to have finally had the chance to try this place, especially with such raving reviews and scrumptious pictures. My husband and I came at a perfect timing, no lines. I could not wait to taste the popular ones: Nam prik ong (red chili dip), garlic prawns, crispy duck with panang and nua nom tok (beef dish). I feel bad to say this....everything was great except the food. They were okay....not as great as a lot of the reviews were saying. I expected food that would just blow my palate away and forever etched in my memory, but unfortunately that was not the case. This place is also overpriced for the food you are getting."}
{"text":"Finally! They're opened! 

I'm kinda disappointed... I'm not sure if they got a new chef or anything like that but I'd still come back. It's just not as good as before. At least my dish. However, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous! And they have a decent sized waiting area! So much more convenient to wait.  

I got the khal soi. SP? I got spice level 6. I know normally this dish gets spicy and I love spicy! But it wasn't really the spicy I remember it as. The portion was smaller. I got the same dish at the old location and it was amazing! But it's not the same. I'll try to come back when they've been opened a bit longer and give it another try. 

We got the coconut Tom ka soup too, I might be spelling these all wrong. That was still yummy!

My bf got the duck panang and he said it was the same as he remembered but the portion shrunk. 

My friends got pad Thai and some noodle soup. I forgot what the noodle soup was called but they all liked their dishes. Their pad Thai tho was lacking in size too. 

I'm hoping to come back for dinner time instead and maybe everything will be what we remembered."}
{"text":"I ate the crispy duck in Panang sauce and briefly went to a utopian heaven where everything is always right, and delicious, and beautiful. I can't get over it, I think about it all the time.
 
Find your way to this oasis of exquisite food in the middle of the desert that is Las Vegas. The duck is perfectly fried, and the flavors in the sauce are perfectly balanced. I got it at a 6/10 on the spicy scale, and it can be taken up a notch but do not overdo it to be able to appreciate the other subtle flavors.
 
We were told that the wait for 2, without a reservation would be 45 mins. Grabbed a glass of wine from their extensive list and sat in the backroom. We got a table within 20-25 mins, worth the wait. Don't be disheartened when you see a line of people outside. Also, there are plenty of cabs there to go back to your hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I've gone to the original location a couple of times a couple years back which was good as well.  My friends and I went and received great service and great food.  The interior is nice, probably also helped that Roy's was its previous restaurant. The food portions were small for the cost, I can't remember if its always been that way or not from about 4+ years.  We ordered a chicken curry, Thai beef salad, tom kha chicken, garlic chicken wings, mussels, combination fried rice, and shrimp pad Thai.  Everything was delicious, and it being for lunch I'm glad the portions were filling for 5 of us."}
{"text":"If you're looking to entertain a client at a snooty Thai restaurant in Vegas, this is not the place.  It's not on the strip -- it's in a strip mall.  However, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent (albeit spicy) food and a casual dinner.  We had a fantastic order of spicy mixed seafood that was debatably on a 2' x 2' plate -- but we almost lost a coworker to a rogue hot pepper while attempting to finish it."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place being \"THE BEST\" Thai food ever so we were very eager to go try it.  I have to say I'm disappointed.  Not sure if it's what we ordered but we tried the top 3 yelped items.

Location:
It's located slightly off the strip so very convenient to get to however the strip mall is old and ghetto.  When we came at 5p it looked dark and abandoned however by 5:30p when they open for dinner there was a huge line waiting to get in.

Service:
Good and FAST, we got our food a few minutes after ordering it surprisingly.

Food:
Nam kao tod - The first bite of this salad was amazing.  The crispy rice is crispy and is packed with flavor.  However by the second and third bite, it was way too salty.  Would not order this again

Tom Yum soup- Salty but standard

Crispy duck and drunken noodles- The duck was very crispy and good.  However the duck to noodle ratio seemed off.  There was like 80% duck and 20% noodles which I guess most people would feel is worth it but I like having more noodles.  After a few bites we were out of noodles and were just eating duck alone

Overall:
Good but not the best Thai food I've ever had and it's a bit pricey.  I feel like you can have the same type of Thai food at other restaurants for cheaper.

Tip:
Long lines sometime but the restaurant is HUGE so it goes very quickly."}
{"text":"A great recommendation in general, but especially if you have an allergic reaction to Las Vegas and want to pretend you're elsewhere.

All I know is this:

- Main dish: Khao Soi.  Always get Khao Soi if you can.

- Appetizer: Nam Kao Toad.  They're quick to recommend it and I was glad they did.  They can make it vegetarian (or, at least, they can swap out the pork sausage for tofu) and it's still delicious.  A bit over salted, but an interesting mix of crisp, spice, flavor."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good thai food. I had this bookmarked for a while and I finally got to try it. Just some advice, I got here at 5:25 and there was already a line, they open at 5:30pm. It wasn't bad but it was a Tuesday.. so I can imagine on the weekends it can get crazy. So on to the food..

I started off with what I always start off with at any Thai place..

Tom Yum w/ Shrimp - This is the first thai place that i've been too that asks how spicy you want your Tom Yum.. 1-10 I got a 7 and it was decent, had a nice little kick to it.  The soup was super flavorful and probably one of the best Tom Yum soups i've had. 

Fried Rice with sour sausage - Bomb.. this had alot of crazy flavors and textures going on.  A tad bit sour but not too much, crunchy peanuts, and lots of veggies mixed in made this dish amazing.

Pad See Ew - This dish was nothing special whatsoever.  It was lacking in flavor and I would not get this dish again.  Very average.. 

CRISPY DUCK w/ DRUNKEN NOODLES - this is supposed to be their best dish.. well the Crispy Duck is. You can have it different ways, I regret not getting the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry.. right before I walked in some caucasian guy told me that the drunken noodles was the best with crispy duck.. why did I listen to a caucasian guy at a thai restaurant when im asian and i've probably had more thai food then hes had in his entire life? I dont f**king know but I should have got it with panang curry, because I even asked the worker which is better and she told me panang is the most popular version of the crispy duck. So do not make the same mistake as I did and get it with curry!! Drunken noodles = pad see ew noodles! 

Anyway this place is a pretty good Thai restaurant and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and the dishes are quite good for an Asian restaurant in the States.  They have good interior design - it's much better inside than the outside so don't get discouraged when you stand outside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint!  so many choices!  Rieslings they have are yummy too.  Definitely have to make reservations or you will probably wait a long time. 

Khao Soi-  reallly good!
nam kao tod - not sure how it's suppose to taste but my thai friend said not enough sausage (hehe)
tub wharn (beef liver salad) - yummy!
mango salad - wasn't bad or anything just not sure if i would order this again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It has the best curry in town and the prices are pretty great too. It also stays true to it's thai roots, and does not include a bunch of non cuisine related dishes. The servers are really nice and the inside atmosphere is nice. Beware, the neighborhood is not amazing and the place is small, so if show up at a popular time, you'll have to wait a long time. Don't get me wrong, it's worth the wait, but they accept reservations, so just call ahead."}
{"text":"I revisited this place on a recent visit to Vegas as upon offering some dining options to people Thai sounded like the most exciting choice and I felt like if they wanted Thai in Vegas well then I'd have to give Lotus of Siam another try. I felt the exact same way on my second visit to the first. Nothing blew me away with deliciousness or culinary execution. I was most impressed by the menu and the variety of offerings and especially the presence of so many dishes I've never seen before on a menu at a Thai restaurant. I ordered the jack fruit curry (because I've never seen it before) and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. This place is pretty far off the Strip so if you're not driving it makes it difficult to get to. We had a party of 8 which made logistics of getting us there and then back to our various destinations a little tricky. Plus when you come out here you really in the desert as we were left trying to figure out what to do to kill time for our 45 minute wait. If you have the forethought call ahead and put your name in so you don't end up in that same dilemma. 

In conclusion, I said it before and I'll say it again? I would hesitate to call this the best Thai, it might be the most authentic but I can't really comment on that. It'll definitely give you a different look than your typical Thai place and if you really like Thai food that might be enough of an excuse to check it out."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night in Vegas. When I came in through the front door there were about 11 seats in the waiting area which were all full of customers waiting already. I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. 

I ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. 

Next I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. 

The Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK. 

If you came here on a busy night and had to wait longer than 30 minutes I would recommend not coming here considering the price. If you do decide to wait it out DON'T order the Nam Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, and Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.

Overall the service was good, the items I ordered were pretty bad with the exception of the Musamam curry, and I would probably not come here again."}
{"text":"Was craving for Thai food and we went due to the Yelp reviews!  I usually order just my normal Thai dishes Beef Panang, Papaya Salad, Tom Kha, and Pad Thai. As I was eating I noticed the tables all around me ordered the Fried Garlic Shrimp and thought to myself do I wanna really spend $25.00 for a dish with 6-8 shrimps?????  Whoa was I wrong thee best $25.00 I spent on a shrimp fish and hands down the best Fried Shrimp I have had!!!  I will be back and just order two orders of the Shrimp and Pad Thai and I will be one happy camper!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thai place in las vegas. They are known for crispy duck pannang and garlic prawns. They are expensive, but i think worth the price tag. You do not get a lot in portion, but you do get a lot of taste."}
{"text":"We almost didn't walk in.  The strip mall is sketchy and we thought we must be at the wrong place.  Glad we came in-  the food and service was awesome and it is nice inside.  We started with a shrimp mushroom soup and fresh spring rolls. Delicious!  Then yellow curry.  Very good.  Then mango sticky rice desert put us over the top.  Best lunch in a long time and our new favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"You must RSVP in advance and you only have a 5-minute grace period!

We made it just in time and didn't think to expect parking to be filled up so quickly (so keep that in mind!)

For the 5 of us, we ordered: Tom Yum ka kai, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang, drunken noodles with beef, red snapper with Chili mint leaf, and mango sticky rice. Everything was delicious and met my expectations.  The rumors lived up to the hype at Lotus of Siam! I'm in love with their giant garlic prawns and definitely recommend it to all seafood lovers."}
{"text":"This Vegas Thai place can be tricky to find. It is off the strip hidden away in a strip mall and can't be seen from the street. But, finding this place is worth it. It has been called \"The Best Thai Food in America\". 

It isn't a fancy place, but the service is friendly and the food is great!  We had a vegetarian version of the crispy rice appetizer followed by a spicey fried whole fish. Wow! We picked that fish clean.  We will definitely be visiting Lotus of Siam again on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I write this not after my 1st time here but after my--at the least--40th.  That should factor into how much weight you put on this review.

LOS is located in a rundown business park; but it's an anomaly among its neighbors.  And that's clear from the moment you walk in.  People often complain about the waitimes (just read a few other reviews on here), but that's just a byproduct of LOS's excellence.  If you want a short line go to Panda Express.

Inside, it's Thai fine-dining, yet a casual vibe remains: you can celebrate an anniversary, you could show up in sweatpants (like I did today).  The walls are plastered with pictures of the owner and various celebrities, food critics, chefs, and friends.  I'll be up there one day, just watch.  An exquiste wine cellar is the centerpiece of LOS.  And its busy bar is a great place to wait for a table.  Once you're showed to your seat, the waitstaff more than take care of you.  They're pleasant, despite being ultra-busy, you'll never be without a full glass of something, and they're happy to explain or recommend a dish.

While the ambiance and service is a highpoint, the food is why this place is great.  I have only had a few dishes, but I don't think their is a bad choice on the menu.  I got Yellow Curry the first twenty or so times I came to LOS.  (That's always been my default dish to gauge a Thai restauraunt.)  It's the best curry I have ever had.  I have also had their Chicken Pad See Ew several times, which is equally tasty.  

The last ten or so times, however, I have ordered--or, better put, devoured--tehir Chicken Khoa Soi.  I get it at a 7 out of 10 on their spicy scale.  It's the perfect balance of heat and flavor.  (I'd get a 5 if you can't handle heat, though.)  It's the best Khoa Soi I have ever had, and I'd bet it's the best Khoa Soi in the U.S.  That's how good it is; that's how good LOS is.  

Whether you're flying into Vegas for the first time, or you come to Vegas often, or you live here, this should always be in your trip itinerary.  LOS, by a good margin, is the best restauraunt--top to bottom--I have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"Best Thai I have had to date.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  This place is in one of the seediest plazas in Vegas, but don't be afraid because it's located near The Green Door.  There's a reason you have to make a reservation here, because it's phenomenal.  If you don't mind spending a bit more for some killer dishes then order off the chef's menu on the back page.  Garlic prawns are bursting with flavor. High quality ingredients in all the dishes.  No bland flavors here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food, but some of our dishes were hit and miss. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time, or call during lunch for a dinner reservation on the same day. If you do not have a reservation, come as soon as they open! We got there 15 minutes after they opened, and it was close to a 30 minute wait for a table of 3 on a Saturday night.

This is actually my second time to Lotus of Siam, and they have remodeled and expanded since I was last there a few years ago. My first visit was for lunch, and they used to offer a buffet, which I recommend against because you really want to try their entrée dishes. The buffet itself was just average. This time around we tried:

-Thai Iced Coffee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw): Not my favorite- this was really dark/strong tasting, and too sweet for my liking. Skip!
-Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Mixed w/Sour Pork Sausages, Green Onions, Fresh Chilies, Ginger, Peanuts, Lime Juice, $8.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#rKk64ejUni6uZqOPhsvAGw): I didn't like this version- the crispy rice wasn't very crispy, and I didn't think the flavors worked very well together. I've had a much better version from Sticky Rice in the Bay Area. Skip!
-Khao Soi Braised Short Rib (Northern Thai Egg Noodle Served in Curry Sauce, Coconut Cream w/Braised Short Ribs Garnished w/Sliced Ted Onions, Lime, Pickled Vegetables, $22.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#LgHpnSwICwKPgyrxHLQ2NA): Pretty good, but the braised short rib was a bit overcooked, and too lean. Most of the pieces were really tender, but the dish overall was bland, although the curry was good. I probably wouldn't order this again for the price.
-Garlic Prawns (Deep Fried Prawns w/Shells, Sautéed w/Special Garlic Sauce, Topped w/Ground Black Pepper, $23.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#b8ru2oKjJXw4Vu5dRuLXZg): AMAZING, and a must order! The prawn shells were super crispy/crunchy, and flavorful. The shrimp pieces were gigantic, and cooked perfectly. This dish made the dinner!
-Crispy Duck Topped w/Fresh Homemade Chili & Thai Basil, Served on Top of Pan Fried Flat Noodles/Drunken Noodles, $25.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#Gec8FZpK3d7Z-iXQs5QLDw): Pretty good, although I didn't think the crispy duck went that well with the drunken noodles, and they give you the tiniest portion of drunken noodles ever. I did like the crispiness of the duck, and the preparation was very unique- something I've never eaten before. I would recommend trying the crispy duck for sure, but not on top of the drunken noodles. 

Service was efficient, and our food came out pretty quickly. Their dishes are definitely on the pricey side for Thai food, but the Garlic Prawns really makes up for all of their other misses. Their menu is so extensive that it's hard to narrow down your order, so I hope to be back again in the future to try out more dishes! Parking is easy in this complex since it's so large, and they help call you a cab if needed."}
{"text":"I did it! I went to a sketchy strip mall where pple almost hit our car twice because they were in a hurry to get to the liquor store across the mall. Outside and inside are day and night. Like another yelper said - wanna be fancy. We ordered over $100 worth of food and over all 2 were ok dishes - drunken noodle prawns and sticky rice and mango for dessert... For all the hype and what not really not worth it. Most of these wonderful awards they've won stopped around a few years ago. 

I'd say for the thrill of almost getting killed from the drivers and the sketchiness of the area. Stay for the adult day care located next door."}
{"text":"I'm kinda teetering on what to rate this restaurant.  I've read a lot that this is the 'best Thai resto in the USA' and I'm really not sure.  I can't say I know everything about Thai food, but it's one of my favourite cuisines and I've been to Thailand in the last few months to know really good Thai food. 

We went with a group of five so we were able to order a bunch of dishes and share family style.  We started off with a hot pot of tom kah kai soup ($15) which was nice.  It was lemongrass-y with mushrooms and chicken in it.  Nice start to lunch.  Aside from the soup we ordered pad thai ($11), papaya salad ($9), crispy duck penang ($23), and garlic prawns ($24), and thai iced tea for me ($2.50).

The superstar of the afternoon was definitely the crispy duck penang!  I will order it again and again every time in the future.  The portion was not huge for a $23 dish but definitely worth it in flavours.  I could eat the sauce it comes with, with anything.  Second superstar were the garlic prawns.  A big platter of butterfly'd prawns that were extra crispy with lots of super goodness to it!!

I know pad thai is pad thai - everyone orders it at a Thai resto and probably shouldn't be ordered in an 'authentic' place like this.  We should have listened.  I didn't like the pad thai and thought it was too tomato-y for me.  The papaya salad was nothing special either - was pretty basic.  It was also made a little too spicy for our mild request.  The thai iced tea was spot on though!!  Tasted just like the ones I ordered off the streets in Bangkok!

I would give this place 3/5 because I literally just had some amazing food in Thailand a couple months ago so my standard is pretty high, and half of the stuff I wouldn't order again.  But service was pretty good, there was no line-up when we went for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and I really loooove a good thai iced tea.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a skanky little place, no decor, bad area but this is where the locals eat, and it's open all sorts of late hours as I recall.  Some of the best Thai food you will ever have in your life. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"\"Wow\"  This was an amazing experience. Food was fantastic and absolutely delicious. Our server was Anthony and the evening shift supervisor was Marlene. These two people took care of every need we had. These two people should teach other Diners what it takes to be Successful!!!!! These two people made us feel like Family. Everyone should go to this Diner!
                                                                                          Rod & Elizabeth"}
{"text":"Delicious........ This's Thai food, taste same in Thailand, by Thai girl.  
I love lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying when there's a line before 5:30pm then you know something is good.  

What a GEM!  

My friends and I arrived there at 5:35pm and oh my good gawd there was a line and people were already sitting down inside.  When we got to the front we were told that the wait for a table will be an hour.  Being that I've heard a lot of great things about this restaurant we opt to wait.  We grabbed a drink at the back bar and sat in that back room.  (Wish they made that room into a dinning area instead of a waiting room)

Eventually after 30 minutes we were seated.  YAY!  
We already knew what we wanted so at that time I sat and looked at all the photos on the wall of celebrities who ate at Lotus of Siam.  

Food: 
Crispy duck with panang
NAM KAO TOD: (Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice)
Thai Fried Rice
DRUNKEN NOODLE PRAWNS

FoodGasmn!  The food was full of bold flavors and delicious.  Definitely a place to visit whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The khao soi, on their Northern Thai menu, may be the best bowl of noodles I've ever had. Had dinner here last night, and returned for lunch today."}
{"text":"About half the menu here is legitimately some of the best Thai available in the US, but that being said, there are some holes/disappointments in the menu here.

First: avoid the soups, especially to go, but even fresh, I think both the Tom Yum and Tom Kha Ga were pretty disappointing.  Second, there's nothing particularly wrong with eating Phad Thai or other basic noodle dishes, even if I skip them in general, but it's a huge error here, there are so many things on the menu you cannot find elsewhere, you are really missing out.

Highlights:

Larb, sour crispy rice, drunken noodles (found the sea bass to be over cooked and disappointing, the rest of the proteins I've tried with it have been fine), panang curry (GET THE SHORT RIB), thai beef salad, pork blood soup.  

Keep in mind they have a pretty high heat tolerance, if you order something as a 5 on their 1-10 scale you will have quite a bit of heat, and I don't see a 10 as being enjoyable by any rational person including people who self-profess to never be able to get food hot enough.  I love spicy in general and wouldn't order anything much higher than a 6 or 7 here with the possible exception of the beef salad where the crisp vegetables compliment the heat very nicely."}
{"text":"Get the whole fried snapper w sauce on the side. The snapper is peeeeeerfect. The sauce you can add as you please. Get the garlic fried shrimp....and eat the shells! They r so crispy, it.s like chips. Get the crispy fried rice. The rice is puffed instead of steamed. The coconut crispy duck panang was xcellent. The sauce is great. Eat it as soon as it gets to the table because the skin might get saucy. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to venture to Lotus on our first trip here to Vegas. The restaurant came highly recommended and we are a family who LOVES Thai food. It's about a 25 minute walk from our hotel but the weather was perfect so we enjoyed the exercise. 

We forgot to make reservations ahead of time so upon arrival, we were told the wait was about an hour and 25 minutes. We decided to wait it out after our walk and low and behold, we were called 18 minutes after checking in.

We were seated and almost immediately greeted by a gentleman to take our drink orders. The Thai tea was perfect and the lemonade has free refills. What mom doesn't love free refills when their kids finish their drinks before even getting the appetizer?! 

After our drinks came, our server came and introduced herself and we order the spring rolls which we delicious! Our server was amazing and very warm and friendly. She gave us the time we needed to decide and made recommendations since it was our first visit.

We all ordered different meals from soup, fried rice, and I had the Khao Soi based on a recommendation from our server since I love red curry! All of the food was cooked to perfection and the flavors were out of this world!

We will definitely be back on future trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai I have ever tasted. Always a wonderful experience going here. Their Pad Thai and the Nua Yum Katiem are few of the best dishes . This place might look unassuming from the outside but it's a burst of flavors inside..and their wine collection is to die for."}
{"text":"Easy to miss, driving by!  It's actually the back of the restaurant on Sahara, you need to turn into the sketchy strip mall to actually find the restaurant.

Good times!  We shared and enjoyed a total of 6 dishes between four girls, the favourites being the deep-fried prawns (eat the shells!), drunken sea bass with noodles, and the seafood salad.  Really, everything was good though - vibrant, fresh flavours."}
{"text":"Very unassuming place in a very shady looking strip mall. If you are anything like us and you drove by and didn't know its reputation you would probably take a pass. But this place is the real deal, believe the hype! 

Food is absolutely amazing. I will say that service is not the best. They rush you and are a bit rude but with food like this I can deal. Don't come here expecting to be treated like a princess, experiment with the menu and do some research. You won't regret it. 

Soooooo good!!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best Thai food I have ever had.  Had the prawns and crispy duck panan...just because it was recommended ... well worth it. Expensive but good....I have to say the service was stellar! I would definitely return when in Vegas."}
{"text":"We did have a rather larger group and attempted to make reservation. The receptionist was lacking in her duties. She made comments as \"make sure you come, ok?\" Put us on hold for a long time.

As we arrived for our reservation, we got a little wait as a party before did not part ways right away. So we waited a bit. The hostess was trying to be as accommodating and upbeat as possible but still unprofessional.

With a large group of us we got to try over a dozen dishes. Tom yum prawn was excellent. The best I have ever had. Chicken satay was ok. Lamb gai was ok. The toasted rice salad was great. Fried fish was good. Soft shell crab drunken noodle was great. Crispy Duck Chu Chee was amazing. Curry chicken bamboo was great also. Thai issan sausage was good. Beef jerky was great. Beef salad was good. I can go on because we came here two days in a roll. The food is very authentic and flavorful. All of the best ingredients.

I also ordered fried bananas during our first visit. It was ok. The second day we came we had the mango with sweet coconut rice and that was fragrant and gently sweetened but not super sweet. It was the perfect combination of flavor. The Thai tea was also good.

Our waiter was great.

Overall here is my breakdown of what I would like to rate this place. The food is a 5 star. The hostess and reception area 4 stars. The ambience is a 4 star. I would have loved to give this place a 5 star based solely on the food but the phone and seating experience was not the best. 30 mins wait with reservations the first day and about an hour wait the second day without reservations."}
{"text":"My family member and I had high expectations of Louts of Siam, mind you the key word is had. We were in the area for shopping, going to appointments and decided to go for late lunch. Once seated our server never introduced himself, but once you arrive even with no wait. It is policy for them to ask your full name and telephone number, why I don't know but they do. While looking over our menus and clearly looking puzzled no recommendations were offered to us nor suggestions. Just \"what will you like to order\", so we piece together our order. Medium spice level coconut milk soup with chicken, mushroom, and lemon grass which was amazing and hot in temperature. Medium spice level crispy duck with egg noodles, which was not spicy nor room temperature, chili mussels that were tough to remove from the shell due them being cold, and crab fried rice. A single lady seated behind us that had the same server was asked \"is this your first time here? Can I make some recommendations?\" I was shocked because it was our first time there and not one suggestion came our way. After telling a friend i decided to write this review along with sticking to Le Thai on Fremont St. I'll try Lotus of Siam when they reopen the original smaller location. Maybe with the move and larger location customer service is only for those they choose to share it with. But after spending a total with tip $92 I was just expecting more."}
{"text":"Pretty good!!!! Their menu is huge! i never know what to order and am overwhelmed!!!!   I've been coming here regularly for 4 years.  I would not hesitate to come back.   My husband loves the curry i love the more boring spicy basil dish or pad see ewe.     I haven't tried another thai restaurant in vegas nor do i need to!"}
{"text":"Man this place was busy. Came here on a Monday night and had a 45m wait. They had our table at the 45m mark just like they promised which was surprising. 

I had high expectations given their reputation, recent spotlight on Top Chef Masters, and lots of high Yelp reviews. I have to say, I've had way better. 


Pros: 

-The place is way bigger than it looks from the door.
-They let you wait at the bar (but you can't order food there).
-They have the largest wine list I've ever seen at any Asian restaurant.
-They have an entire page devoted to Riesling by the glass.
-Their Thai tea is good, and I don't even like Thai iced tea.
-Their infamous garlic shrimp dish is super flavorful, sweet, and salty.
-Crab fried rice was decent but not a revelation. Super greasy.
-Pad thai tasted good and was cooked al dente. Small portion but good ratio of noodles to proteins.
-Service was relatively friendly.

-Cons:

-High prices. Small portions. 
-Pretty decent flavors in most dishes except for the tom yum koong which was just all lime and chili with very faint lime leaf taste and no real garlic, sugar, nor lemongrass flavors. They also use white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms like advertised. I was so bummed since white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms in this soup is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to Thai food. Ugh. -They also say that all dishes come with white rice, but there was barely enough for 2ppl (we had a party of 4 and were forced to eat like rice was a scarcity). When I asked for just one small additional scoop, they charged for it. Wth?!


Beer wine sake only. Large parking lot. Plaza seems sketchy. The meal wasn't bad. It was just disappointing after all of the hype and also in comparison to places I've tried in SoCal & NY."}
{"text":"I think everyhing I have to say has aleady been said. In a nutshell:
make a reservation and arrive 15 minutes early; be careful in the creepy, ghetto parking lot (I was approached by two old people on bikes asking for money); order the prawns and duck Panang and be make sure you ask about their spice levels! 

I've only had water here but their wine list is very extensive.

My only regret is that I ate most of my curry and was pnly able to have two prawns. I took them back to my hotel and had another 2 in the morning. They were still good then, but it hurt to have to leave the rest behind."}
{"text":"This place is what you'd call a hole in the wall.  People say that this is the best place for Thai food.  I thought the hype of how good this place is, was going to be the influence of how I thought how good this place was going to be.  All I can say is this is by far thee best Thai food I've ever tasted.  Hands down.  I've never strayed from the usual Pad Thai and curry that I usually order, but this visit, with a person who knew all the good things to order, last nights dinner ranged from prawns, to braised short ribs in curry sauce, to drunken noodles, scallops, to even the oddest dessert of mango sticky rice. 

My favorite was the beef salad.  The beef salad is amazing!  The beef was a thick cut and tender.  And whatever dressing or marinade that was used was full of flavor.  I would go back and just order that as a meal.  I think we ordered the garlic prawns and that was one of my favs along with the crispy rice.  Everything that was ordered was delicious!

I highly recommend this place!  Left satisfied and full!"}
{"text":"Every. Bite. Was. The. Best.

Here is the thought that kept coming to my head at lunch hour today as I dined on the lunch buffet and watched a group of 4 waiting for their food, \"if you had the buffet, you'd be eating by now\". I'm sure their entree's were good but...."}
{"text":"totally awsome--we refer our friends to this restaurant any chance we get.."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing! I'd have to say the best Thai food I've ever had! I had the drunken noodles w/ chicken and shrimp spice level 7 (really really great spice and flavor). The appetizers were great too - try the dumplings ;)

Only reason for 4 stars was the wait for food was really long. They actually forgot to put our food order in and we had to ask the waiter to check on the food. They apologized and were quick to get the food out to the table after that."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had in my life! Really lives up to the hype. It's also one of the only Thai restaurants I've been to that offers Northern Thai dishes. Garlic prawns are a must. 

Arrive early or be prepared to wait for a longgg time!"}
{"text":"The Best Thai in Vegas!  I like the drunken noodle with sea bass, beef salad, garlic prawns, any of the curries, and mango sticky rice with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for almost 5 years! But every Vegas trip, something comes up and I end up not being able to go. So needless to say I was super excited to go. 
The outside looked awful, but often the hole in the wall places are the best... we went in and it was packed with great energy! We were seated right away. 
Let me first say that the service was excellent, mostly due to the assistant to the waiter, but excellent none the less. For appetizers we ordered the crispy rice (#14) which is supposedly the best, I found it interesting, but I'd never order it again, and the papaya salad which was very good but not the best I've had. 
For dinner we ordered the red curry w beef which was excellent, the garlic prawns, which were huge but very expensive and very mediocre, and the soft shell crab drunken noodles which were not very good at all... 
overall, I wasn't impressed, and with all the great food in Vegas, wouldn't go again. I've definitely had better Thai food."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing Thai food...Northern Thai Cuisine is different than what most restaurants serve.  Flavors are more subtle but perfect for the palette.  Each dish is carefully crafted to mix just the right flavor with texture and yes...aroma.  Best Thai food EVER - hands down."}
{"text":"Great quality and service. Food was excellent, creating a upscale environment while still maintaining to their cultural roots. 

We went on a Tuesday afternoon, the line wasn't too bad at this time, probably a 10 minute wait. But the restaurant was fully packed. The crispy duck and garlic prawns were delicious. A little bit on the pricey side, but everything we had was family style. So overall experience was worth it"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.  Food is excellent.  Service is always great.  Very cheerful. Some of the best Thai food that we've been able to find in Vegas! Will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Oh my, is this place fantastic! Best thai food I've ever had. You must have the Nam Kao Todd."}
{"text":"Gotta be among the best Thai food I've eaten in the US. The spicy fried rice had the perfect heat and was amazing. Definitely worth the hype ( by Anthony Bourdain) and detour from The Strip."}
{"text":"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas....unless you're talking about the absolute best Thai food you'll find this side of the Pacific Ocean. Then go ahead and tell everyone!

What to order:
- Khao Soi - A curry noodle dish from the Northern menu. You don't find Northern Thai food too often in restaurants, but based on this dish, we should see it more. You've had Pad Thai a million times, get this superior noodle dish instead.
- Garlic Prawns - Not overly greasy, not quite tempura, not quite salt baked, utterly perfect. The prawns are huge, well seasoned, and the shells (also fried) are equally delicious!
- Crispy Duck in Penang - I've basically only had duck cooked the Chinese way (roasted, Peking-style, or braised) or the western way (confit or medium rare breast). This is a whole new world of preparation, and it's incredible. The texture is great without sacrificing flavor. And baby, I could bathe in that panang. 

Tips:
- If you're going for dinner, you'll want to make a reservation. Lunch doesn't take reservations, so just get there as early as possible.
- Dishes are pricier than other Thai restaurants, and they are also typically smaller (trust me, it's well worth it!). Order accordingly. 
- The spice scale (from 1-10) is calibrated toward an American palate. So if you're like me and have a real need for heat, order EVERYTHING at level 10. You can request for it even higher if you really want to punish your GI tract.
- Driving is preferable as the cabs can be unreliable. I'd keep your valuables out of sight though.

If you're only having one meal it Vegas, eat here.
If you're staying for several days, eat here at least twice."}
{"text":"order this -- KOONG SARONG and NAM KAO TOD everytime for an app. trust me this place is the best thai food ever.................and theres over 1000 wines on the wine list."}
{"text":"Ok so apparently Tiesto came here?? So of course I wanted to see what the dealio was. We got there around 12:30pm on a Monday - Memorial Day - and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. We were seated in 5.

There are soooo many items on the menu! It's far more than just your typical pad see ew, crab fried rice, papaya salad mix. They have BBQ, seafood, curries, and even a section called \"Northern\" with a bunch of Northern-influenced dishes. 

On the table: 
* Spicy squid salad - Not much to say here! A refreshing bed of greens with a light and mildly spicy vinaigrette with squid rings!

* Crispy duck panang (curry) - SO flippin' good. First time having crispy duck in CURRY. The duck was ultra crispy even though it was doused in the curry. You could tell it was freshly made for the table. I wish all Thai place that served curries have a crispy duck option now :(

* Garlic prawns - Some were prawn meat, others were just fried batter parts. BOTH delicious! Super meaty & not overly battered. Crisp af. It's becoming a theme here. Didn't feel nasty or indigested after!

* Seafood fried rice (with chicken) - Well done. Each rice-let (can I say that?) was separated from the other. That's how you know it's good fried rice!

* Soft shell crab drunken noodles - Mmmm this place knows their seafood and does integrates it damn well! There were generous with their portions as well. Delicious!

Might be one of the best Thai places I've ever had! This was our pit stop before heading to the airport. Stuffing myself silly before a flight was not the best idea..."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in the States.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on their menu is bomb!  You can't go wrong here at Lotus!"}
{"text":"I'm a foodie that loves Thai food. I've eaten at many Thai restaurants. This is without a doubt, the BEST Thai food I've ever eaten! And prices were very reasonable. This place is a hidden gem and I will be coming back every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dump from the outside but the food is so good.  Everything I have had here is excellent.  You won't get in without reservations.  Very reasonable prices without the noise and glitz of the strip.  If you want great, authentic thai food you can't go wrong here.  Been here two times with varied groups of people and all love it."}
{"text":"Good tasting thai food, but the portion sizes are ridiculous for the price. Waiter was very nice and attentive. Overall, I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be returning. (:"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand.  It is an awesome restaurant with super fresh ingredients and authentic flavors.  Portions are a bit smaller than what I'm used to from a Thai restaurant, so it makes it a little bit more expensive than I'm used to...but it's WORTH it!!  You'll see some celebrities inside the restaurant and on the walls but it's not high end.  It's in a strip mall out in the middle of no where.  Well, not really, but when you're used to the thousands of people on the strip, this is a nice get away.  Do expect to wait!  There's some shady asian bar next door and a church in the same plaza HA! Lots of free parking.  

What my friends do is we order it to go and take it back to our hotel rooms, that way we can get ready for going out as well as having food readily available.  It is still good after being in to go containers.  They are very good about sending orders out in their to go containers!!"}
{"text":"I can't vouch for authenticity because my experience with Thai food is admittedly fairly limited, but it's simply delicious.  One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"great tasting food very hard to get in good luck getting reservations 
if your lucky enough to get in enjoy exotic foods"}
{"text":"Best thai food, i am not too sure. BUT i did have the lunch buffet (8.99), pad thai was ok, the curry had too much ginger. I might have to come back for dinner to experience the full effect. I did try the mango with stickey rice...again, not sure what the hype was....i stick with mango pudding.

Service was very good"}
{"text":"Great customer service, clean place. ( a little out dated but that's okay) 
The Pad Thai was perfect, I was curious to try the Northern Thai menu since it seemed like their specialty dishes.
I ordered the Kang Hoh and Northern Larb for my BF and I to split. 
There was a spice in there that had a weird smell in the Larb and turned me off to the dish. 
It's not to say it wasn't cooked well, it was just not for me. So I can't give this place five stars until I come back and try their regular Thai items.
I recommend their Pad Thai it's wonderful."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet Mondays only because of the beef soup. Good food reasonable price. Chicken , noodles ,fried rice, all part of the buffet. Plenty of things to eat. Very busy all the time. Not in the best area but I still go. Lots of celebrities come here to eat."}
{"text":"I'm actually really sad to have to give Lotus of Siam 2 stars.

I haven't been here in years, the last time was probably 5 years ago when they still had the lunch buffet.  That was great and a good value.  However, their dinner menu is really something that was disappointing.  After waiting an hour on a Wednesday night we were seated.

We came with pretty high expectations and unfortunately they were not met.  The food is pretty expensive, between $22-$32 per plate, which we all shared.  Got the highest recommended dishes like the garlic prawns, crispy duck, etc etc.  We spent almost $150 on 5 dishes after tax and really didn't think any of them were that great.  The flavor was lacking and portions were small.  If you are paying $30 a plate for Thai food, the portions should be a really good size.  However, these portions were almost comically small, especially for the price.
The flavor of the dishes is really where I had issues.  The food wasn't bland, but it also wasn't flavorful or even very good.  It was very ok.

We left disappointed and not particularly full.  I can't recommend this place in any way.

All hype, no substance =("}
{"text":"Wow ...walk in the door and your senses take you straight to Thailand ...  loved the food. Wait staff was not to what I perceive as great standards.   But they are very regimented and I am sure by Thai standards top of their game.  After all this is a true Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Lotus of Siam, first time with my wife.  We ordered Pad Thai, green curry and garlic prawn.   The food was great, waited about 30 min though to get our food.  Pad Thai was flavored right and not too salty at all and without overpowering soy sauce taste like many others we have had in the past.  My wife was never a fan of green curry but she liked it and so did I.  It was not salty at all and I finished everything including the sauce!  Could have drunk the sauce like soup.  The garlic prawn was great too.  You can tell the freshness in the prawns by the texture of the meat, almost like Maine lobster that I used to buy live and prepare myself.  Most delicious meal we have had in Vegas for a long time."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in America thus far! Omg! They had everything that I enjoyed from Thailand. Food that I can't get anywhere other than (I thought) going back to Thailand. 

The garlic prawn that people rave about, I didn't find anything special about it. It was very crunchy, large size prawn, and had garlic taste to it. Many Yelp pictures consisted of this dish, which was very picture worthy. But after having one shrimp, I focused on my favorite dish, read below. 

The tom yum noodle soup, was very, very good. It's the dish I order at Thai restaurants. I typically have to order off menu at other restaurants in my hometown, but this was on the menu. The 2 tables near me also ordered this dish as well. Their presentation of the noodle soup, the bowl, the condiments, the choice of fork & spoon... I absolutely loved every single aspect of it. The taste was really good as well. I love it with extra ground peanuts and wanted more tangy so I had to ask for extra lime & ground peanuts.

Koong char num plar!!!!! Omg!!! I haven't had it since Phuket and been wanting this dish!!! It was so good! The size of shrimp wasn't like the size of a prawn, but it was exactly like how I remembered it. Served with raw garlic, fish sauce, chili paste, and mint leaves. Yuuuuuum. It was sooooo good. Beware, it's raw. But if you're like me, your stomach should be used to raw seafood and knows how to handle it! (Wink wink)

The last dish is BBQ Game Hen. I could've totally skipped it. It didn't taste as good as it looks on Yelp pictures. I wanted to add some meat to the table instead of only having seafood. Though we finished this dish, I could've totally skipped it and rather have room for mango sticky rice. 

The servers were great. Food was memorably good. I wish I lived nearby so I can return more frequently. I'll definitely recommend this place to friends who are traveling to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm torn because the service was great and the food tasty, but prices a bit excessive; I will settle for four stars.

The exterior looks pretty basic/plain, but walk in and you find an elegant restaurant with a lot more tables than you might expect. Service is also very attentive and professional, and I was checked on multiple times throughout my meal.

The menu is extensive, and the food was great! I particularly enjoyed the texture of my crispy duck. I also ordered the shredded green papaya salad; it was good, but I've definitely had better. They offer a 0-10 spice level, and I ordered somewhere on the low-medium side and the spiciness barely registered; I definitely need to pick a higher number next time.

My biggest qualm with Lotus of Siam is the somewhat outrageous prices. I know duck is usually more expensive, but I think my duck dish was $25+, and not even that big of a portion. At a Cantonese restaurant, you can get an entire peking duck for that much money! 

The food here is excellent and I would still consider coming back, but just be prepared to spend a decent amount of money to get full. I easily finished all of my food and spent about $40 after tax and tips for one person."}
{"text":"Food was good . Less option on the vegetarian dishes (no meat). We had ordered fried tofu , vegetable spicy soup and vegetable fried rice. All the dishes were moderate."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food you'll ever eat hands down. I had their khao soi with beef and it was one of the best dishes I've had in my life. I was so surprised by how the flavors just combined perfectly and each bite was so tasty. We waited about 25 minutes to get sat but it was well worth waiting. The restaurant is very clean and a good amount of spacing between tables. The staff is all really friendly and very knowledgeable on their menu items. You will not be disappointed with anything you order here."}
{"text":"So worth the ride off the strip!  OK decor but that's not why you are going.  Great food.  Some of the best Thai food you will find anywhere!  Robust menu with very helpful descriptions.  How to decide... 2 of us got a soup starter, 3 entrees, and a couple drinks each.  For less than $70 w/tip - great deal.  This is a must visit for every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Lotus has to be the best Thai food I have ever had! You will not be disappointed with any of the items on the menu. Reasonable prices. You can have anything according to your spice level. Deeleesh."}
{"text":"This place is way overated! We ordered the tom kha kai; and it was extremely salty and sour. The crispy duck curry and drunken noodle were quite boring, nothing special. Plus they are overpriced! Service was also really bad. With the money that I spent here, I rather go to some Thai restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip to enjoy better food and service. It was like a joke to me!"}
{"text":"Great Thai place located in the Commercial Center strip mall on Sahara. Tucked away inside the mall, this place is actually a lot bigger inside than it looks. And not exactly a hole-in-the-wall as it might appear. Huge selection on the menu which I love, and lots of good authentic items. Many Northern and Burmese dishes. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high because all of my friends have raved about this place but I was so disappointed!  
We got a seat right away at the bar area, facing a white wall.  Service was not very good, kept having to try to find our waiter (not a big deal for me if the food is good). Food came out quickly. We asked the waiter what he recommended. We got two of the three dishes he said were popular: garlic prawns & Chilean sea bass on drunken noodles. And got garlic pepper chicken wings.
The sea bass was good, but the drunken noodles were okay (there was a big clump of noodles - which left some bland noodles). The chicken wings were probably the worst I've ever had. Super dry and tasteless. Could not taste any garlic or pepper. Totally plain & dry. The worst was the garlic prawns. There were only 5 jumbo prawns and a lot of battered shells. I guess you're supposed to eat the shells?  I do not like to eat battered shells. Especially when they were dry!  I ate my two dry prawns only because they were $5 each!  My husband ate the other three. We left all the battered shells on the plate. The waiter asked if we wanted them boxed. Hahahahaha. No thank you. 
What was amusing to me was that the waiter asked how our dishes were. I said \"okay\"...and he didn't seem to care. The server who came to take away our plates asked how things were.  I told him we were disappointed with the prawns. He said he would talk to our waiter. Then he came back with the bill. No changes. $78 (before tip) for a very disappointing meal.  I've had better Thai food in our neighborhood Thai restaurant at home (which is just an okay place).   I'm just so surprised at how busy the place is! We were soooooo relieved we didn't wait the 1.5 hours for a table. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, warm atmosphere. Awesome place for Thai food!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet. It was decent. Nothing to rave about. I have a hard time imagining how it could rate as best Thai food in the US. Maybe ordering from the menu leads to better results. But I think Pin Kaow is better."}
{"text":"Don't let the curb appeal keep you from this restaurant. It's in a very unlikely location but the food is a good as it gets. Try the combo fried rice and the drunken prawns. Can't wait to go back. I recommend you have them bring out 1-2 things at a time. Otherwise they will bring it all at once and you can feel a bit rushed. Last thing bring you wallet. It's fantastic but you pay for it."}
{"text":"The food and the service are excellent like we expected! Their new place is way more fancy than the old one! Hands down for the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas   Thank you Nay( From Brian Kim Long)"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype! My friend and I were in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and planned to come here for lunch on our last day. During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas. Worth the cab ride from the strip and definitely worth the hype! :)"}
{"text":"In LV on business, and decided that I would make the trip to what was described to me as \"Mecca if you love Thai food.... outside of Thailand, of course.\"

I drove my rented minivan to the strip mall (yes, you read that right a minivan. Me. In a minivan. Oh, and the strip mall too... and no, there weren't strippers at the strip mall) on Sahara. As I hustled to the door (it was very cold!) the small, completely unassuming store front seemed quiet for a Wednesday night. And then I opened the door. 

The place was positively cavernous, given the little entryway. I put my name down and went to sit at the bar while I waited the estimated 30 minute wait (it was less!). The bustle of the place is amazing. The smells, the service... there's a great energy and an extensive list of beers and wines to get you started. 

Earlier in the night DH had told me to ask if they had a tasting menu (they don't, but what a great idea!) so that I could try more things. It was only by the stroke of luck that my neighbours at the bar and I shared a similar last name, country of origin, and is turns out, passion for food. When we were seated next to eachother, they ever so graciously shared their appetizer (heaven on a plate) and I shared my tom ka kai (holy crap was that good).  The Ginger Sea Bass was perfectly delicate. You'd expect the thai flavours to overwhelm the fish, but instead it was perfectly balanced and prepared, with the fish still having just the right bite.

I'm a Pad Kee Mao aficionado. I eat it everywhere I can because it's my favorite and I'm always looking for the most amazing one. And thanks to my new super BFFs, I got to try not one, but two ways that Lotus of Siam excels at it - one with prawns and one with crispy duck. People, you can not go wrong. Order either. Order both. Eat all the things. 

I will absolutely, positively, with 100% certainty be back. Because there is soo much more to try and everything was truly flawless (including the service!)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had so far in Las Vegas. We ordered the duck curry, pad see yew, soft-shell crab, beef panang, oyster pancake, a ton of Singha beer, and mango/coconut rice to finish it off.  Place is pretty popular now and even though they expanded, you still need a reservation.  Everything is pretty good and might be better than what I've had in LA."}
{"text":"OK, seriously WTF did I spend $20 on?? I can't believe I gave this place 4 stars last time purely on reputation. With my own reputation on the line, I have to take out 2 stars from before as I was truly unsatisfied from the meal.

Since we did the lunch buffet last time and afterwards we read it's best to actually order off the menu at Lotus of Siam, my buddies and I ended up doing just that at dinner this past weekend.  None of us were wowed with the dinner and would just give it 3 stars at most for the dinner. After thinking about it even more, this place to me don't even deserve 3 stars.

We ordered the following:

1) Thai Iced Tea: Something that really can't be F-ed up, and it's pretty good here.  Nothing to complain about.

2) Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice: The fried rice had a strong curry taste, but lacked ingredients.  The portion was small, and had yes, the plate had 2 friggin shrimps and pineapples out of a can.  For $8, I expected more.

3) Pad Thai: As the menu said \"It could have been one of the most popular Thai dishes of all time.\" Clearly a mistake since they probably meant to say \"It could be one of the most.....\" Anyways, usually I like pad thai at any Thai restaurant and the one done here is eh...so-so.  My friend was looking for the bean sprouts, it's like WTF happened to it?? Again, the portion was pretty dang small for something that cost $8

4) Spicy Catfish: Very bland and not that spicy. The fish didn't taste that fresh and I was probably the biggest fan of the dish amongst us at the table. Definitely a bad choice on our part, but hey, could that be the case with all the stuff we got?

5) Chicken curry w/o coconut milk: It wasn't something we got off the curry menu, as this dish was on one of \"Siam's favorites.\"  Definitely, it was not a favorite of our's. The curry was watery, lacked in flavor and ingredients. Seriously, another epic fail in my eyes.

6) Mango with sweet coconut milk sticky rice: Probably the best item we got that night. At $7.95, it wasn't cheap, but hey, nothing was really \"cheap\" here other than the fact we got a lot of bad food. I'll give credit when it's due. The mango was fresh and I liked the toasted rice on the sweet coconut milk flavored rice. Too bad we had to get 2 orders of this item since again, very skimping on the portions for the price.

Seriously, over the course of the meal, I had this WTF look as I was eating. For what we paid and all the reviews of the place, I expected a lot more. Definitely more than what I had at the buffet a few months back. Maybe I'm used to LA's Thai Town or Siam I Am in Redondo's prices, but seriously, nothing was of any good value here. I know it's Vegas, but come on, it's located in this ghetto Asian strip mall. Pfft... Will I come back here again? Hell no. I could find better food eating at the Bellagio Buffet w/o leaving the strip. This meal taught me one lesson. I will truly appreciate what I have in Thai Town and the various Thai restaurants I frequent in the South Bay.

Lotus of Siam = Epic Fail

*Note* We were hungry enough that we hit up Echiza for the 2nd time in 2 nights. My favorite place to eat in Vegas, by far."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  My soup, beef satay and chicken pad tai were outstanding.  Do whatever it takes to eat here the next time you're here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The food was delicious and full of flavor. We got a salad and sweet and sour tofu for an appetizer. Divine! I ordered the red curry with tofu ; spice level 6. Love spicy food and it was spicy! Full of flavor and made with passion."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.
Several of my friends heard rave reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. First off the wait was ridiculous... a good sign I suppose. We finally were seated after an hour and 30 minutes. We ordered everything from the pad thai and fried rice to the panang curry. There were 10 of us. The food was mediocre at best and I'm being nice. I don't know what the hype is. The service is uber slow and the food is not that great. We left disappointed and annoyed at the friends who dragged us there. 

My husband and I actually checked out another thai restaurant during another visit to Vegas, Thai Style Noodle house. Now thats authentic Thai food. It was soooo good and cheap. I'm so sad we don't live in Vegas so could frequent this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Lotus is located in a rather dead looking strip mall, and from the outside, the restaurant itself looks run down and shady. You might think twice about eating here based on the appearance, but no! Do go in for some of the best Thai food. As soon as you go in, you'll realize the restaurant is huge and fancy. Consider getting a reservation beforehand. Our group was lucky enough to be seated promptly, since we came in right at opening. The restaurant fills up very quickly.

Deep fried pork ribs (with sweet and sour sauce?): Excellent. You would think deep fried pork ribs would be dense and dry, but the meat was really soft, tender and juicy. Good amount of sauce to give the dish a lot of flavor--a flavor that everyone can like. The portion was great. Highly recommend.

Catfish salad (Plar Dook?): Very fresh and the deep fried catfish was delicious. Again full of flavor and fried nicely. Great starter. Recommend.

Drunken Noodles: Flavors on point and noodles cooked perfectly. Typical and safe noodle dish.

Penang Curry: Typical penang curry. Again, flavors on point. Can't go wrong.

Basil and Chili (With duck): The duck was wonderful. Crispy yet moist. Seasoned well and good portion. Recommend.

Overall, we were very satisfied with our experience here. Some of the dishes tasted the same as any other thai restaurants, and some were beyond that. What I did not like was that, when we were placing our order, with every dish we mentioned, the waitress recommended something else. I appreciated at first since every restaurant has something they're known for and something they're better at, and as a new customer, sometimes we come in not knowing what we should try. But after awhile, it was a tad bit annoying. She tried to have us order something different in place of every dish that we asked for. Was it a coincidence that all the dishes she mentioned were the most expensive ones under each category?...

Anyhow, besides that, the service itself was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has to be one of the top Thai restaurants I've come across. I am so grateful I caught an episode of a morning Fox local LV show that featured Joe Bastianich (Masterchef Judge) referencing it as a must eat when he's in town. I have to agree with Joe. 

Don't let the stripmall location fool you, inside you'll find a large restaurant with lots going on. I arrived just before closing on a Tuesday night and there were dozens of people still present enjoying their delicious meals. I took Joe's recommendation and ordered the spicy beef salad which was out of this world! We also had the spicy fried rice (chicken) and the pad na noodles. Everything was so delicious, including the fried wontons which had tons of flavor. We skipped dessert but enjoyed a nice bottle of wine. Everything was fairly priced and the service was great. I will definitely be returning every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I should preface this with the fact that I am not an adventurous eater.  I like Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Thai Egg Rolls, Dumplings, and the like.  The other diners in my party had different experiences based on the level of adventure of their pallet.  Those who were willing to try the more exciting options had amazing dining experiences.  Those of who weren't, didn't find ourselves as impressed.  

The wait was so long.  90 minutes on a Wednesday night at 5:30...  that also didn't help my mood.  Bringing my own alcohol wasn't a positive either as fancy cocktails always, always enhance my dining experience (though, I know this is because they just moved and are awaiting a license).  The hostesses were not nice.  The waitstaff were beyond nice...  super attentive and helpful.  Crazy how different the two were.  They probably need to work on that dichotomy.

My egg rolls were good.  My chicken noodle dish was okay.  My place in Denver is far, far better.  I almost feel like they don't want to be known for that stuff so they don't care too much.  My chicken was over cooked and dry.  The noodles were a little flavorless.  It wasn't bad, just not good or memorable. 

Would I come back and wait for hours for another table while mixing my own drinks like a college student at a Frat party, nah.  I'm good."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food!  Had so many great dishes.  Really enjoyed the Crispy Rice, Coconut Soup, Fresh Spring Rolls, Yellow Curry, Sea Bass Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai.  What really impressed me was what happened when I was leaving.  Because we were a group of 6, gratuity was added to my bill.  I didn't notice and added and additional 20% gratuity.  As I was walking out the door, the server ran up to me and showed me gratuity was included.  Wow!  How is that for integrity!  I will most definitely return to this amazing hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best Thai food I've eaten. Would recommend the crispy duck. Never tasted anything like it - can't really say much else than you have to try it if your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Review #666, written 06/06/16--because Lotus of Siam is devilishly good '(^^)'

In Asian literature, lotuses serve as a motif to symbolize inner beauty, because lotuses em emerge as elegant flowers amidst mundane lily pads in muddy waters. Lotus of Siam epitomizes this as an unpretentious restaurant serving Thai food so earth-shattering, it is as if a pack of elephants has trampled through your prior memories of pad Thai and tom yum.

Lotus of Siam was unearthed when a friend heard about it on an Anthony Bourdain show, and it was placed on the Vegas food list. Although the wait is notorious, we got there a little after 9pm and it was only a 10-minute wait, during which we perused the extensive menu (and it still took quite some time to decide once seated; the pages of Thai delicacies were endless!). The catch for the last seating is that the kitchen was taking last orders, so there was no chance to add anything. We decided to err on the side of ordering too much, and it was the best decision we made on the entire Vegas trip.

(+++) GARLIC PRAWNS (deep fried prawns with shells, almost like potato chips, sautéed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper) Almost like potato chips. Love that description! The hype cannot be more real, and you likely won't be able to eat shrimp the same way again. The shrimp itself was fresh and succulent, and the highlight was the shell which was deliciously umami with a kick from the pepper and garlic. I devoured it even though I usually detest shrimp shells (hurray, finally I get my glucosamine). 

(+++) TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style; a distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice) The spices and seasonings render a tantalizing complexity, bold and adventurous like an adventure to Thai street food, yet simultaneously unique and meticulous like a long-standing family recipe. I especially liked the touch of coconut milk, making it indulgent but not too creamy. Probably one of the more under-rated dishes as the garlic prawns steal the spotlight. As a bonus, this is served in a pot with an open flame, which looks exotic and neat in pictures (but the shape made it difficult to scoop the soup towards the end... when we were all craving more sopu)

(++) KHAO SOI (typical Burmese influenced dish, served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables) We decided to get the beef version since the famous duck khao soi was quite a lot pricier. Like the rest of the dishes, the flavors were untamed with rich curry paired with coconut cream, contrasted by lime and pickled vegetables. The noodles were soft and mild, quiescent in juxtaposition with the fiery broth, and the wonton crisps added a playful garnish. Beef was okay, nothing special (thankfully so since I'm running out of my repertoire of food description words)

(++) PAD THAI (stir-fried thin rice noodles with eggs, green onions, bean sprouts and chopped peanuts on the side) Homey and more familiar, though still noticeably different from your typical pad Thai. Their version was not greasy and very well balanced, at the intersection of aromatic, spicy, and savory. We took the rest to-go and enjoyed heavenly leftovers two days later as our last meal in Vegas (even after our palates had been spoiled by Bacchanal).

It totaled $81 for 3 people, which is considerably more expensive than your typical Thai joint but a completely different level. The Northern Thai style is distinctive, made even more so by the chef's style. According to the website, she utilizes what has been passed down in generations. Lotus of Siam has no neon lights or Corinthian columns and is unimpressively located in a strip mall, but the food speaks for itself--flawless in technique, exotic in flavor profile, and interpretative in embedding the culinary tradition of the chef's roots."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5.

We originally went to eat at palace station oyster bar but the wait was 1.5 hours long so we headed to this place. They open at 530 and we arrived at 5:10 and there were several ppl in the parking lot already. We lined up like there was a Black Friday sale.  At 530 they opened doors and took ppl with reservations 1st. We were seated fast and received great service. 

We went with yelp recs and got crispy duck in panang curry. It was amazing with perfect 8 spicy although very expensive.  We also ordered the soft shell crab with Drunken noodles which was pretty good but it was a small portion and expensive. Chicken wings weren't anything special. Garlic prawns were delish but again def expensive. Portions were small so we had to order 2 more items. Got the beef jerky which I personally didn't enjoy. I'm a sausage fiend so we got the sai oua which I felt was a little dry and missing something. 

Overall, I wouldn't wait for 2 hours for this place. Everyone raves about it and I agree the food is mostly delicious but the portions are way too small for the price.  Our bill was $113 before tip between 3 of us.  I'm going back to my fav thai nakorn in garden grove, ca."}
{"text":"Me and some buddies of mines where there for CES, and we dropped by.  FOOD IS OFF THE HOOK.  Service is great as well."}
{"text":"This place has been described as the best Thai food restaurant in the US.  After four trips to Thailand, I have to agree.  This place is a must if you love Thai food. Not only is it a Thai food lovers destination, it's reasonably priced. On a recent visit to Vegas, we ate there twice. It was that good. One of the fun things about Lotus is the waiters are very knowledgeable. Our waiter was able to recommend four things and even threw in something we had never tried. I love that.  We had a rice appetizer that I had never heard of. It was spicy rice roasted in mix of exotic spices. Totally unique and delicious. Then we had crispy ribs with a nice garlicky sauce on the side. Falling off the bone yummy. After that we had Khoa Soi with chicken. It's a coconut curry soup with rice noodles and crunchy noodles in a curry soup with many layers of flavor.  It was better than the many bowls I had on my recent trip to Chaing Mai.  After that we had Duck curry , & spicy beef salad. The spicy beef salad was so perfectly satisfyingly. The beef tasted like it had marinated in spices and it was fork tender. There was basil and it was the best I have ever had. We also loved the beef larb. Really authentic spice . I can't say enough about this place it just is absolutely authentic Thai food, but better."}
{"text":"Love this spot, didn't mind the wait...love the regional food part of the menu(coconut chicken curry dish) and the tempura prong appetizer was legit"}
{"text":"Great curries, short rib was tender, duck was great, fantastic coconut ice cream afterwards"}
{"text":"I came due to the food network, and I have to say it's quite delicious. 

We had the Tom Ka soup extra spicy indeed it was it had at least 4 types of chili! Sooooooooooooo GOOD!!! 
The Papya salad was flavorful 
The Pad see ew was very tasty
The charbroiled steak was yummy too, tasted very much like carne asada.
Oh and the red chili dip that we came here for specifically was really good too!
The BBQ chicken wasn't :( it was pretty dry
The staff was great too."}
{"text":"I was told this Thai restaurant was extraordinary and Yelpers raves about this place so I had to try. Went in around 830. Got my table shortly, about 15 minute wait. Waited another 10-15 minute for my menu and our server. I noticed a new table opened up and the same server went over seconds when they were seated. 

Long wait, but still fair considering it was full house. Ordered the chicken satay, pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp, roast duck w/ curry and pad Thai. Dessert, ordered the fried banana a coconut ice cream. 

Portions were very small, flavor were no different from other Thai restaurants. Only the pad Thai stood out to me, everything else were decent , nothing extraordinary in flavor. 

Because the mango sticky rice were seasonal, I had no choice but to the try the fried banana and coconut ice together. Not worth the $14 for one banana and flavorless ice cream. 

Very disappointed, will recommend others to try, but I won't be returning. Food 4/10 and the service overall 2/10."}
{"text":"we are so boring.. we got the same exact dishes when we last came in November 2015. We got the garlic prawns, seafood drunken noodles, and pad see ew. The garlic prawns are a must if you come here. You won't regret it. Make a reservation to save you time in line.  We always make a reservation and they are happy to. We need to venture out next time and try at least one new dish."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. This is the kind of place people go to simply because a lot of other people go.

We arrived at 5:20 PM Sunday (they open at 5:30) and there was already a big line outside in 102 degree heat. People in Las Vegas must not have anything better to do than stand in line?

Once the doors opened the staff was adequate. We were seated quickly and the food came out fast enough.

The problem is how unbelievably small the portion size is. I literally took 4 spoonfuls of my $12 massuman chicken curry and the bowl was empty. The chicken was tough, dry, and tasteless. No spice to the very thin, watery sauce at all. I was literally done eating within 5 minutes. My wife had $13 Pad Thai and it was very small too. 

When we were leaving, the lobby was stacked with people waiting to eat. It really makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"I've been completely been spoiled when it comes to Thai food thanks to home cooking and spectacular places in NYC and LA. Lotus though, isn't too bad.

Getting here may terrify some of you, especially at night. Like almost everything off the strip, Lotus resides in a strip mall. This one is particularly sparse and shady and is populated by folks who will solicit you for money.

Once you walk in through the doors, wow! Shiny! Especially that liquor and wine room! The walls are lined with photos of mama chef with various celebs. But, I'm here for the food, so let's have it.

Chicken larb, moo yang, rice and singha. I thought these would be a good indicator of the food here. The larb was good (although not spicy for a \"Medium Thai\" request). The moo yang was also good, with all the right aromas, flavors, and sauces. Did it blow me away? No. If I were in Vegas, would I come back? Yes.

Until the next."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai food in Vegas, yes it costs but its worth it. The new Flamingo restaurant is beautiful, elegant dining with custom finishes like wall paper made it Thailand, gorgeous venetian plaster etc. When I want an elegant atmosphere and great Thai food, take a date or family and good friends, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying this Thai restaurant if you're in Vegas! This place gets very busy, even on weekdays. I came here on a weekday around 730pm and there was a 30 minute wait for 3 people. It's probably a good idea to make reservations if you don't want to wait at all. 

I tried two of the dishes and they both tasted amazing. The tom kah kai is a soup made from coconut milk. I did not know what to expect because I've never even heard of it before, but I liked it a lot. I shared the hot pot with 2 other people and I thought it was the perfect amount. We each got about 2 small servings of it. I even started to get full before the entree came out! Pad Thai tasted good as well. I like how I was able to taste the different spices in the dish. I had a bite of my friends pad see ew and drunken noodles, and liked them too. I don't know if they have any bad dishes. 

I would definitely come back here! Just remember to make reservations if you don't want to wait because it gets really busy."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Las Vegas, you have to try this place. We came here with 12 people and everyone enjoyed every appetizer and main course we got. The drinks were great and desserts were even better! And the best part of this was it was really cheap! When you pull into the driveway, it looks like a strip mall. But when you come inside, it's nicer than your best 5 star restaurants! Don't come to Vegas and not try this place! Make sure you ask for Adam! He made our night complete and fun!"}
{"text":"The new location is beautiful! Lotus is always worth the wait - so suck it up and take a seat at the bar while waiting for your table. Unlike other thai restaurants in town, this place really delivers the spice - so for those who love a tingling of the palate - shoot for 7...no amount of rice or thai tea can extinguish the 10."}
{"text":"It's a solid restaurant away from the strip. 

The waiters we got was really friendly and accommodating, especially when we were a group of 11. I got the Combination Beef Noodle Soup and it was very tasty. It had spice and a touch of sourness, which worked well together. It was a very warming dish on a chilly night. What it didn't have was enough food, ha, my stomach was left not very full.

We also shared the coconut ice cream (which apparently they're known for) and their sticky rice for dessert. I loved how their desserts weren't too sweet.

Overall, the prices were affordable and the food was very tastey and homey, so it was a better than average Thai restaurant. However, I have tasted the same or better quality of food in a lot of other Thai restaurants. Maybe in Las Vegas, quality Thai restaurants are harder to come by."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas!  Food, service, and cleanliness was on point.  Pad Thai was cooked to perfection and not dry what so ever.  And the banana sticky rice was the perfect touch for dessert."}
{"text":"What to say about Lotus that hasn't already been said? Probably not much.

1. Location: Scary... Seriously. Don't bring your kids here after dark. Just about every other establishment in the strip-mall screams \"stay away if you want to wake up with two kidneys tomorrow morning\"

2. Food: This is why this place gets 5 stars. This is Thai food that you won't find anywhere else. The Northern Thai specialties lend themselves to some dishes that will take you for a ride. Be adventurous. In my experience asking the waitstaff will lead them to just recommend you the regular \"safe\" stuff, so just pick one yourself. 

3. Drink: A thai place with a better wine selection than an upscale Italian restaurant? Sure, why not? 

4. Service. Havent been too impressed here - but to their credit they are ALWAYS packed and have to deal with tourists all night (this place may once have been a \"hidden\" gem, but it has most decidedly been found by the tourist crowd now)

All in all, this place lives up to its great reputation. Try it out."}
{"text":"Ok, this place gets 5000 stars for food.  It was WAY over the top good.  We started with the fried fish cakes and they were unbelievable.  Then my sister ordered a fried shrimp dish - they are fried shells and all.  You eat the shells and they are \"like potato chips\".  I had the fried softshell crabs and we shared a bean dish.  Both my sister and I were torn between two different dishes and the waiter quickly pointed us to what we ordered and I could have hugged him for it.  The flavors were just out of the world. Things that were supposed to be \"medium spicy\" had a very pleasant heat but not painful.  Would go again in a heartbeat. 

They have a fantastic wine selection and unlike many Thai restaurants your wine comes in real crystal and not thick glass goblets.

So why only 4 stores?  The ambiance is assaulting.  Bright lights, acoustical ceiling tiles, disgusting carpet, cafeteria style dining rooms (the place is quite large), tackily-hung photos on the wall.  In a word:  Ick.  I noticed a dimmer switch near the wine room and almost adjusted the lighting down.  Just to give my eyes a break.

The service was not-so-bueno.  It took a very, very long time.  But all was forgiven when the first dish arrived."}
{"text":"What can one say, always excellent. Love the new space, very classy. Garlic shrimp, crispy duck... Perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very impressed with our first time trying Lotus of Siam. Their new location is beautiful and newly remodeled. We ordered the Khao Soi and Massaman Curry. Both were very flavorful and delicious. I feel like you can't make a bad choice from the menu.

For dessert we enjoyed the Deep Fried Banana Roll with Coconut Ice Cream, which is basically a tempura banana with rich coconut ice cream.  What an amazing combination!

We loved Lotus of Siam and we definitely plan on coming back here soon. I highly recommend this restaurant. It's cheap, delicious, and filling."}
{"text":"I went to LOS and the food was good, I had the drunken shrimp prawn, they were tasty but the noodles were stuck together so I asked the waiter is that what makes them drunken. I had the crispy duck with red curry, I didn't care for that at all. I had the crab fried rice it was very delious I would take the trip there to eat that again. Most people were there to have the buffet which looked good. We got there around 11:00 and we were second in line. The service was fast and the waiters were helpful. I say try it for a new experience."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. My first time at the new location and I love the atmosphere way better than the old place. Food is always amazing. Only suggestion I would have is to improve on the cocktail menu and come up with some signature drinks as well as more wine options."}
{"text":"UM.... my mouth was burning of spice and I could care less!
The flavors, the quality, the taste was above par!

A few of my favorites:
Drunken Noodle (spicy)
Panang Curry (usually my favorite but this place spiced the heat a bit too much)
GARLIC PRAWNS (I can eat these forever!!!)
Pad thai (usually the favorite... not spicy)

Uh win win!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, must visit this place! Please, don't order pad thai or the regular stuff people get at Thai restaurants.  Go for the Northern Thai dishes, says Anthony Bourdain.. and I trust the man.  The service is fast, the food is good, and the alcohol selection is decent.  One small complaint - the dishes are overpriced.  But then again, what isn't in Vegas? I'd definitely come again! :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food I've had in the country! So good that the 3 of us at our table forgot conversation and instead regressed to orgasmic noises through the meal.. no kidding! The garlic shrimp was crisp and seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic to perfection. We couldn't get enough of the Sausage with crisp puffed rice seasoned with spices lemon juice and coriander leaves. Spicy minced chicken with vegetables was a great filler as we waited on the 2 entrees: Crisp pork belly (#87) was done to perfection and Penang beef was a fantastic creamy, spicy broth on the sweet side that went beautifully with rice. We ended the meal with mango with coconut ice cream... divine!!!"}
{"text":"Forget the service charge I talked about last time. Their food is so damn good I am willing to pay more.

Amazing food. Service is nice with a smile. Need to book in advance or risk standing in line."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Las Vegas.  There is a reason Chef Chutima won the the James Beard award a few times, most recently in 2011 for SouthWest best Chef.  The food here is creative and exquisite.  Simple things like the Chicken Satay, is transcended.  It had a moist and delicate taste.  One could even skip the peanut sauce on it.  The Chile spicy wings hit on a lot of notes.  It was sweet and savory at the same time.  The skin was crispy and crunchy and the meat was cooked perfectly.  The Garlic Prawns had a lot of crunch and great garlic taste, without overpowering.  It was like eating little lobsters deep fried to heavenly perfection.  The Stuffed chicken was surprising great.  It was moist and tender on the inside, with the crispy Panco crust on the outside.  The combination Fried rice was flavorful and not greasy.  The best has to be their red dip, Nam-Prik-Ong!  It the flavor profile hits on so many notes.  You can't beat pork on pork (use the pork rinds).  it starts off crunchy and salty.  Then it steps up to hit of sweet and savory.  It finishes with a spicy note at the end of the journey.  I HIGHLY recommend.  It is probably one of the best dishes on the menu.

It is not located in the best area, a bit off the beaten path.  I think that is why it makes it so extraordinary.  One would not think to find such a ray of light in an otherwise shady part of town.  Having tried many Thai places, this place is on par with one of the best like Pok Pok in Portland."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food and friendly service.  However, it appears to have become a tourist joint with several taxis waiting outside, and while the prices were similar to other Thai restaurants, the portions were smaller than I'm used to."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is simply good but nothing special, particularly since it is so expensive for Thai food.

Lissa G and I wanted to try out Lotus for quite some time and we finally got a chance to stop by. We went for lunch and arrived shortly after they opened.  The inside is much larger than it looks from the outside. Be sure to get there early or expect a wait. After being seated we ordered some of the recommended dishes.

We asked for all of our dishes to be 7 out of 10 spice level. BTW...not high enough if you like it spicy.

Nam Prik Noom (Green Chili Dip)
The dip was an excellent start and made us excited for the next dishes.  It was the spiciest dish we had and it could be explained as a chucky Thai salsa. The crunchy pork skins and vegies to dip were perfect for the dish, especially if you are trying to stay away from carbs.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice)
Ok this dish was pretty addicting. Basically crunchy rice with all the typical great Thai flavors. A must get.

Very excited at this point...
but unfortunately down hill from here.

Garlic Prawns
Very disappointing especially for $24. The ingredient's quality and portion size was well worth the price but the flavor and preparation was lacking. You could tell the oil the prawns were cooked in was not hot enough since they just weren't crispy enough to eat the shells, and we LOVE eating shrimp shells and all. The prawn were also lacking any flavor besides fried prawn.

Panang Beef
Basic dish which was mediocre even compared to our local hole in the wall Thai restaurant we go to locally.  Also, not spicy at all at level 7. Again disappointment.

Sometimes it depends which dishes you get a restaurant and that may me the case for us. You will not have a bad meal here but temper your expectations if you had good Thai elsewhere like in LA or SF."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for years and wish I would have came sooner! The food is absolutely amazing. We all shared 7 entrees and a bunch of appetizers and I can't say anything big bad about any of the dishes! Service was great as well. They just moved and don't have a liquor license yet but it is byob."}
{"text":"This place is surprising.  It's in a crappy looking run down shopping center and as you enter, it's a very narrow entryway.  When you get inside though, they have a big wine cellar (they have pages and pages of wines) and pictures of celeberties on the wall.  The food is absolutely great and reasonably priced.  It was packed in there within 15 minutes of opening for dinner.  The Rad Nah and the Tom Ka Gai soup were some of the best I've had.  I recommend this place, for sure!"}
{"text":"Off the strip! 4.5 stars 

We got there 10-15 minutes before they opened for lunch..so no one was there but us. YES! We had dinner there once before too.-make sure to make reservations a week in advance if you plan to go for dinner. They serve the same menu for dinner as they do for lunch...it's just less busy during the lunch hour and they only accept walk-ins. 

We found out about this place and decided to try it out because Anthony Bourdain dined there once before with Jet Tila on Parts Unknown. Lol 

So far we've tried..

Garlic Prawns $27.95 -fried to perfection! It's so crispy that you can eat the shell and tail whole. (Bf's fav!) 

Chilean Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles $30.95
Fried Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles $22.95
-small portion of delicious noodles but they're perfectly chewy! Both the deep fried chilean sea bass and soft shell crab are amazing! Neither would disappoint. 

Crispy Duck with Panang $27.95 -Amazing! Tender pieces of duck with a light crispy coating on thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. 

..and the forgettable dishes.. 

Tom Kah Kai Soup $10.95 -sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemongrass and lime juice. Omg..it was soooo sour. We had to ask the waiter to take it back to make it less sour. : /

Nam Prik Ong \"chili dip\" $11.95 -one of the least spicy northern chili dips..it's actually not spicy at all! It has ground pork, tomato, and dried spices. It reminds me of meat sauce..and it comes with a small assortment of veggies and fried pork skins to dip. (Jet Tila ordered this..meh. Lol)

Nam Kao Tod $8.95 -this was okay..I've had better nam kao in Oakland. 

Their menu is verrry extensive! Everything we ordered was that was delicious was mostly in the \"Chef's Choice\" section. Stick to those dishes and you won't be disappointed! I highly recommend the crispy duck panang, soft shell crab or Chilean sea bass drunken noodles and garlic prawns. 

Lotus of Siam is a must whenever we come to Vegas! Worth the short uber ride off the strip. :)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally made it. Well worth the wait. Had the drunken noodles sea bass and short rib curry noodle. Both dishes were fantastic. If you like Thai, you have to try this joint. Expect to wait as it was busy and the staff says there is always a wait during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a lot of our visitors \"go-to spot\"! And I get the hype. Appreciate the hype. And respect the hype. We always have a great time. We always enjoy the food and the experience. However, I will be clear. To me, this is a great institution and a great food experience. Yet, this is not the best or my FAVORITE Thai restaurant in this city. Yes, every dish is AWESOME! I LOVE their pork belly. I love their fried rices, yes plural.  Their scallops. Noodle dishes are good. 
Reservations are required in my book, if not, you could be stuck waiting for an hour or so. It's a GREAT place to take visitors. It's a great place to go because there are so many great write ups about this place. However, as a local, this will not be my personal go-to spot."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out because of the raving reviews I've read, but I have to say that my experience was pretty much a let-down! I kind of feel bad that I recommended going here for a friend's birthday since they love Thai food lol. 

I ended up ordering beef panang and thai iced tea. The panang was not that great because I didn't really taste much of the spices. The only thing that was apparent was the spiciness, but that gets kind of boring after the 5th bite or so. I've been to some hole in the wall Thai places which had better panang than this place. I did get to sample some dishes that my friends ordered and I have to say the pad thai and curry with duck was really good. They kinda skimped out on the curry and duck though! I guess you could order that if you don't have a big appetite. I love thai tea and always get it when dining in, so this experience was no exception. Was kinda bummed that not only was the thai tea ordinary, but it paled in comparison to some other places I've been to. 

I'd say this place is worth visiting, but do take your time to read the reviews and see what people recommend on ordering. Also, this place is located in a shady area so don't go alone! I MAY come visit another time, but only if my friends really want to check it out again lol. This is one of the few places I'd say is more based on hype rather than quality of food."}
{"text":"This place gives new meaning to the saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"  Stuck in a rundown shopping center next a wig shop, I didn't know what to expect from what I've heard to be \"The Best Thai Food in North America.\"  

My co-worker swears by this place and gave me a list of menu items to order: Chicken satay, steamed sea bass (not on the menu), shrimp garlic, and mango with sticky rice for dessert.  My boyfriend and I ordered some crab fried rice just in case the recommendations turned out to be \"too Thai\" haha.  Turns out we enjoyed the crab fried rice the most.  Everything else was good too but nothing I would rave about.

The staff were accomodating and sweet.  The atmosphere was homey and inviting.  The only thing stopping me from giving this review 4 stars is all the hype.  Then again, I'm not a Thai food aficionado."}
{"text":"Definitely overhyped, but then again I fall for the trendy hyp-est things in the world. It's my own fault. I went with only 1 other person so I wasn't able to order many things, which made me sad, but what made me EVEN more sad was the $30 cab ride it took to get here. SIGHPIE. We ordered:

2 thai teas - average
1 pad thai - really good, I was pleasantly surprised and the portions are ok
1 green chicken curry - the sauce is really thin and milky, definitely not enough meat or veggies in this dish
1 famous fried shrimp - this is probably my FAVORITE thing so far. The shrimp was crunchy and flavorful. Definitely worth the $15 price tag
1 ground pork with spices appetizer - probably the most disappointing. This dish was unusually sour, like so sour it was hard to even swallow it without a huge gulp of water. When I gooogled this place, this was one of the most popular dishes. I say, if you're used to common simple thai dishes, this is not going to be to your liking"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've eaten and real quality food. Waiter was really informative and corrected my Indonesian pronunciation of \"Panang\" which I guess I was supposed to be right since it's based on the Malay language but they said it \"Paenaeng\". Since there are so many reviews, this review is just for my own record. Ordered off menu lamb shank with green peppercorn sauce. Lamb was too rare for my taste but I loved the tenderness and the sauce. Ordered crispy duck in panang sauce and friends loved it but I was ok with the duck honestly -- not as crispy as I thought it would be, but perhaps that's cos it took me a few minutes before getting to it. Also ordered special of the day seafood hot and sour soup. It was awesome except that the crab was all skin and hard to get the meat. The sauce was perfection tho and I became obsessed to research northern Thai food now! WOOOOOOO can't wait to try cooking these curry sauces! @.@

Always make a reservation. Reservation is hard to get and Sunday is more crowded than Saturday. I was able to push my reservation on a Saturday from 7  pm to 7.15 pm to 8 pm which I really appreciated of them to cooperate since I was only in town for 3 days even tho the lady seemed annoyed which I don't blame her for (I had lost my car key earlier then got stuck in traffic). We got a spot 8 minutes before 8! My friend who came the next day (Sunday) had to wait 30 mins+ even after her reservation."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome... love the crispy duck Panang curry and crispy prawns.... menu had so much options... definitely my go to place whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food, but you need to stick to the favorites.  We ordered a meat dish that sounded good, but it ended up being really dry.  

All the other favorites we ordered ended up being really good.  The only bad part is taking a cab from the strip was about $25-30, so we had to add $60 for transportation from the strip.  Next time we're going to Vegas, we're staying off the strip, renting a car and going on a foodie adventure!"}
{"text":"Never had anything like this before. I love Thai food and have eaten a ton of it, but now i feel like this place has kinda ruined it because nothing else will ever match up to the crispy duck khao soi. Oh well guess i need to move to Thailand now :("}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet.

I recently came here for a lunch buffet.  My co-worker, who loves Thai food, kept going on and on about how good this lunch buffet is.  I love Thai food as well.  I love the crab fried rice, beef panang, tom yum goong, and many more.

But since this is a buffet, I was hoping for some yummy curry...but they had chicken curry, which wasn't the flavorful kind that I have eaten.  I was disappointed to see so many chinese dishes on the buffet line (hot/sour chicken, moo goo gai pan-type of dish, regular fried rice...).  One plate of food that I barely ate, I moved on to the fruits.  They do have fresh sweet fruit, I must say (watermelon, cantaloupe, pear, apple and oranges).  That made me a bit happier.

All in all, I don't think I will be going back for the lunch buffet, but will try the food on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Loving this restaurant!!!

I've been meaning to try this place, but always forgot to make RSVP early. This time, I called the day before, and got a late dinner reservation for next day. I was very nervous and afraid of the hype, but very pleased with the experience.

From yelpers' recommendations, I got Garlic prawn, Drunken noodle with sea bass, Crispy duck panang, Nam Kao Tod and Pad Thai. Everything was very good, and I can't wait to try other dishes in our next visit. For us, the must order dishes were garlic prawn, and sea bass. The curry sauce is amazing, but the duck was just okay.

I thought the dishes would be small, but it was plenty for the three of us. Our waiter even told us we had ordered too much, but ours eyes were bigger than our stomach :) 
Service was better than the average Asian restaurants, so it was a plus. Pricing is higher, yet reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"So the front of the restaurant doesn't look appealing. I was really surprised walking in how much room the restaurant had. I've heard so many things about this place and finally decided to try it out.  
I went lunch time on a weekday and I was surprised I didn't have to wait for a table. I didn't try the lunch buffet I just ordered ala carte. The garlic prawns were so crispy and perfect but my favorite dish was the spicy beef salad with eggplant.  The eggplant was still in a raw texture but matched perfectly with the spicy citrus flavor. The steak was charbroiled and very tender. I definitely recommend this place for authentic thai food."}
{"text":"The food here was definitely delicious. I ordered the chicken dumplings, salad, seabass drunken noodles, garlic prawns, and crispy duck panang. By far my favorite dish was the seabass, just the seabass though. The noodles that came along with it were nothing special. The seabass was very moist and well seasoned. The rest of the dishes were good, but I really do not have anything to compare it to. If you were to come here, you definitely will not be disappointed. Their service is incredible for a place that is so busy. They never let our water glasses fall below half. We did have to wait a while for our dessert. We ordered the coconut ice-cream with sticky rice and the banana spring roll. They were both very tasty, but nothing out of this world. Overall the food was very good and I definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Worth the 90 minute wait. Food was delicious, authentic and amazing.  Wish my stomach could have held more!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, it was a little off the beaten path, and the wait was about an hour, but the food was fantastic.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The new place is a bit smaller than the last location but it's closer to the strip.  The food continues to be outstanding with the drunken noodle prawns still one of my favorite.  

The service is good and the drinks are reasonably priced especially for the area.  There is limited seating around the bar area, where you can order food, if you want to chance it and go without a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm a Thai food junkie. Not to sound hyperbolic, but I could literally eat Thai everyday. This restaurant has been highly recommended by many people and I'm so glad I finally had the opportunity to try out. It's a cab ride off the strip in a dismal little strip mall, but don't be deterred, it's worth the trip. The wait was long, even though there were several open tables which was a bit confusing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I started with the chicken larb appetizer which was the best I'd ever had. Three of us dined \"family style\" so we were able to try a lot of different meals. I ordered the green curry which was very good...they are not shy with their spices, so buyer beware. (They can always cut the spice down if you get too ambitious.) Also had the Tom Kum Kai Bangkok soup which had me sweating and my sinuses cleared. We also passed around some Koong Tenn, a roasted shrimp plate that was by far the best meal ordered that night. The shrimp were huge and prepared perfectly. Definitely worth trying out, and I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is busy, you need to make reservations! I came here with friends last night and the place was packed but I was glad I had made reservations.

The ambience is delightful with a nice waiting area and bar area. The place is huge. I ordered Thai fried rice with pork and Pad See Ew with beef. They were both delicious and not greasy. In my party, they also ordered Pad Thai and Lad Na. You have the choice of shrimp, pork, beef, and seafood for all the entrees.  The portions in my opinion are not big. Dishes like fried rice and noodles are more reasonably priced but still a little on the expensive side. I have been to a lot of Thai restaurant to compare :) But the quality makes it count.

We ordered Thai tea and I didn't realize it was $4.95 until one of the lady pointed out it was too pricey!

Overall, a great environment with friendly staff."}
{"text":"We had four entrees and ate family style. The sea bass salad is the perfect starter. The fish is perfectly cooked and citrusy. Also had the crispy duck, prawns with drunken noodles, and the green curry chicken. All were outstanding and highly recommend each dish for their flavor and diversity. The table favorite was the duck. Love this place."}
{"text":"Okay place, their spicy shrimp soup could be spicer. I asked for an 8 and still had to add extra hot sauce since there was really no spicyness. 
Maybe I went on a bad day? Maybe I'll try this place again but for now I'll stick to my usual Thai food spots"}
{"text":"Went there w/high expectations coz Anthony Bourdain recommended it. So disappointed! The Khao Soi & garlic prawns were strictly ok. My awe & respect for Tony went down a notch :( if you want to have the best Khao Soi, go to PaaDee in PDX. Even PokPok does better Khao Soi!"}
{"text":"I would say that this is one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.

It is located in the sketchier area of Las Vegas, sigh. We couldn't even make it into the restaurant without a man following us from our car to ask for money, and then getting on his knees until we got into the restaurant. Ay yi yi. I saw a few other would-be patrons getting hassled in a similar fashion from others as well.

We had to wait about 15 minutes before were were seated at our table. You're definitely going to feel a little claustrophobic in their waiting area because there were many people mushed together! 

Overall, it was a good experience while dining. They always made sure that our drink glasses were filled and came over to check on us often. I had Pad See Ew (my favorite Thai dish) with steamed tofu and my friend had one of their duck entrees. This place has the BEST Tom Yum Koong that I have ever had! :) The food still came out pretty quickly for how packed they were that night!"}
{"text":"This is an exceptional Thai restaurant.  The food was fantastic, and there is a HUGE menu to choose from.  You have the perennial favorites like Pad Thai on up to the more rare things like crispy fried pork bellies.  We were impressed and wish it was closer to us.

Service was quick.  Even during lunch rush we had our food surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"The best, That is all!  Life time resident of Las Vegas, and this place has never disappointed.  Best Larb I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"The parking lot is empty, there are signs up reporting break-ins, and they have two signs indicating status of operation: open and closed (at the same time). Arriving at the door on the strip mall, one does not expect to walk into a beautiful little restaurant with glass chandeliers, a large exhibited wine collection, and a well lit, well furnished, clean restaurant interior. The service was on excellent with our water (which was delicious, and perhaps the best part of the meal considering we had been out drinking the night before) always being refilled. In addition, the food was served timely and tasted delicious. The specific dishes we tried are listed below:

Pad thai - 5/5
Perfectly seasoned, not over-cooked. No sauces were overwhelming, and the dish was not at all greasy

Drunken Noodles with Beef - 3/5
The noodles were fine, and the beef was seasoned okay. The downside of this dish was that the noodles did not hold any flavor and the sauce washed away the seasoning from the beef to make it taste extremely bland relative to the other dishes order; thereby making it not as enjoyable.

Garlic prawns - 5/5
Crunchy, well-seasoned, large serving size, and not greasy at all. This was my favorite dish

Panang curry with chicken - 5/5
The curry tasted amazing, and the amount of chicken included was very reasonable relative to the size of the dish and amount of curry sauce. Goes well with the steamed rice, which is free by the way."}
{"text":"So, I wasn't so sure about this place when we walked up--it looks tiny and run-down from the outside but is quite big inside and oh so good! 

Highly recommend it.  Everything we had was amazing--soup, beef short ribs, pad Thai, duck. So, so good!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this restaurant.  The first thing that noticed was that it was clean and appropriately lighted.  The waiters/server were professional and attentive. The place was packed and it seems like everyone was enjoying their experience.  I ordered the pork pad Thai and it was good. The only complaint was that it wasn't as spicy as I'm accustomed to but it was still tasty.  The server offered to provide me with a spice tray but I didn't want to ruin it. Overall, I enjoyed it and I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"We got here right before they open again at 5:30PM and there were already people waiting. We didn't have a reservation but were seated quickly anyhow. It looks like a small restaurant on a large empty strip mall but inside it's considerably spacious and nicely decorated. We ordered the nam kao tod, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang curry, and softshell crab drunken noodles. All were super delicious. Garlic prawns were probably my favorite - it's done so well - super crispy on the outside but perfectly done on the inside. Pricey but still worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and the hype from all these food tv shows! Finally got a chance to go off strip and eat here for lunch! Don't get me wrong the food is pretty good but overpriced due to the popularity and hype. We ordered drunken noodles with fried fish, and the was tasty but the noodles were a bit too soggy for me. The Northern style curry was more like a soup. But I did enjoy the crispy duck panang curry! The prices on some of the dishes are a bit overpriced and small in portion size."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my mother - her first time at an Indian restaurant - service and food was really good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Thai food is easy to find, Great Thai food is almost impossible to find, but Lotus of Siam has it. The location is a bit dingy from the outside, but you can't argue with the results of the food. 

Fresh raw prawns with hot sauce and fish sause is a real treat and very authentic. Crispy fried duck curry was amazing and some of the best curry and duck I have ever tasted. Drunken seafood fried rice has lots of seafood, but was actually not that good (compared to the rest of the food at least, but still an 7/8 out of 10). Mixed in some fresh lemon Thai soda or Chang beer and its a great place to eat away from the strip. 

Reasonable prices to boot!"}
{"text":"This place. I love this place. I went here based on a recommendation from a friend and it has changed my taste buds forever. Every time I come here, I order a feast of food. 

The crispy duck panang curry is amazing, the beef pad se-ew is delicious, the Tom Kha Kai soup, perfect, and the garlic prawns are a must have. It can be a bit pricy, however the food is truly worth the price (and wait). 

I would recommend making a reservation prior to coming here because the wait can be at least an hour on a typical weekday. However, they do their best to accommodate you. The staff is also friendly and the last time I came here, they were very quick to serve the five dishes I ordered. 

If you come to Vegas, please make sure you stop by Lotus of Siam, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Everything here was phenomenal. We had the soup with seafood, tom yum, Larb salad, but damn the garlic shrimp, oh my the garlic shrimp. Only for fine eaters. If you can handle crispy shell then you're in for an amazing experience. The fried rice dishes were good, but the star of the show was the crispy pork."}
{"text":"Get the:
Garlic prawns
Crispy duck
Soft shell crab"}
{"text":"Obviously Lotus of Siam is hailed by many as some of the best Thai food in the US.  I haven't been to many Thai places so I can't make that statement, but I know it's definitely some of the best food in Vegas.  

I've been a number of times, both pre and post expansion.  If you haven't been there in over a year then note that they've expanded and have taken over what I think is part of the wig shop (yes, wig shop) next door.  Like a lot of good places in Vegas, it's in a strip mall and if you didn't know it was there you would never see it because it's not facing the road.  The strip mall itself is a bit old and run down, and the exterior of the place is not impressive.  The entryway of Lotus, even, is tiny and cramped.  Their \"waiting area\" has space for about 4 or 5 people and that's it.  Once you get inside, though, things look decent.

If you go at night or on a weekend expect a bit of a wait if you haven't called ahead for a reservation -- don't worry though, no fancy wear is necessary, a t-shirt and shorts would be fine.  Normally you can just walk right in and get seated immediately.

Every time I've been the staff has been helpful, courteous, and attentive.  They do a lunch buffet which I thought looked rather pedestrian the couple of times I've been there during lunch, but honestly you should actually sit down and order a real dish or two rather than pick from the buffet unless you happen to work near Lotus of Siam and go there frequently for lunch.

The menu is absolutely huge, with maybe up to 200 items on it, and they offer both northern and southern Thai dishes, not that I would necessarily notice the difference.  The prices are usually around $10 per dish, and they have a wide selection of wines since they've expanded if that's your thing.  

The chicken satay is a good classic appetizer that's done well and served with the usual peanut sauce and a small vegetable salad.  I've also had some garlic & pepper chicken wings which is probably the only thing I've had that I've not been overly impressed with.  They were a bit too dry to me.

As far as dishes go, I had the moo yang (grilled pork with a very nice savory dipping sauce) once and thought that was pretty good.  The next time I got the chicken panang curry and that has become my usual order.  The quality of the ingredients is top notch and the portions are large.  Every person I've ever taken here has been very impressed.  

As a side note, if you do drop by Lotus of Siam when they are packed and you don't have a reservation, just go to the adjacent restaurant, Namaste, which has some extremely good and similarly priced Indian food."}
{"text":"Delicious , high quality food and the restaurant got nice design . 

Food : 10/10 .

Will come back next time when back to Vegas. This restaurant will be on my list ."}
{"text":"Great menu! There is so much variety here! Came in before 12 noon on a Thursday and had no problem sitting down with a party of 6. Wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food hands down! I loved the different flavors of every dish. It transported me to Thailand. The restaurant is in a dingy run down shopping mall 15 minutes cab ride from the main strip.  Well worth the trip! Once inside much more impressive. Service was impeccable. I will revisit when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very delicious. The food and service great.
The location may appear sketchy, but the clientel is not."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I had the Wor Wonton Soup and it was fine until I bit into the chicken. It literally tasted like they soaked it in dish soap. One of my sisters had the Northern Kah Kai Soup and she ordered a 5/10 spicyness and it wasn't even spicy, just extremely salty. She had to send it back to the kitchen. The wait staff also wasn't great. Multiple times our waitress spilled water and threw down silverware. I believe overall this place is extremely overhyped. Perhaps they were too busy and the quality wasn't as it normally is but overall not the best dining experience. Also, my other sister gave her toddler a piece of the beef and he promptly threw it up. The cat fish was good though but again you order a specific spice level and it doesn't come out the way your ordered. Disappointed. What a bad experience at a supposedly \"good\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't normally enjoy eating Thai food, but this place was pretty good! 
I really enjoyed their pad tai (don't know how to spell any Thai food), and other dishes.. some fried rice, stuffed chicken, two kinds of soup (same soup but different main ingredients- one had chicken and the other one had shrimp), another type of noodles, and some other stuff.  Since I made a reservation the day before we didn't have to wait and were seated immediately. The area was pretty ghetto. We weren't sure if we were at the right place at first...but yup! It was the right place! Willl I come back here again? I will if I'm ridiculously craving Thai food."}
{"text":"Food is the best west of the Mississippi. Expect long waits and crowded environment but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Our friend who is now officially a local said \" we are going to the best Thai in the world\". Now as you can imagine that is a big statement and something I was weary of, my trepidation certainly wasn't eased once we arrived to the hole in the wall type front door, but then we entered and the place was packed! Our friend ordered her favourite dishes and we were off. The fish was cooked so perfectly it was like a hot knife cutting through butter, then the crispy rice was a playful tease to the taste buds with the sour notes working fantastically with the sausage. My winner winner chicken dinner moment was the duck breast in a red curry sauce. How the hell did they get the skin crispy, flesh like butter and remain that was until the last piece was demolished? I'm guessing some sortie confit was going on here, either way it was my DOD (dish of the day).
Now that I have decided my friend could be correct I. Saying this is the best Thai in the world, the second highlight was the eclectic mix of people throughout the restaurant. From little kids to 60 something millionaires with 20 something plastic brides (good on em). It was definitely an eye opener.
Do yourself a favour and give it a shot!
Food 9.5/10 service 7/10 decor 6/10"}
{"text":"Great place to find wonderful Thai food. We had the pad Thai and garlic prawns with drunk noodles! Also had the Tom Kah Kai soup and egg rolls. Delicious, and the bill was only $53!"}
{"text":"After 4-5 hours of driving from LA, fueled only by Starbucks, honeydew, and pure excitement, the crew and I headed out to Lotus of Siam upon the reco of a friend who was here just last week.

Thinking that it would be packed as it was last week, we tried calling in to make reservations. To our disappointment, they wouldn't accept reservations on a Friday night so we decided to make it out there anyways. It's not too far off the strip but be sure to have a good lookout because we nearly missed it if a friend had not pointed out an Indian cuisine sign right next to Lotus of Siam.

This place is literally fabulous! The food is great, service is fast, and the portions are just right (for those who enjoy moderate portions). Please order the following:

a) Curry Catfish
b) Chicken Spicy Fried Rice (spicy level 6)
c) Seafood Soup
d) Pad Thai

Seriously, this place is legit. You gotta try it, especially when you're sick of paying ridiculous premiums for food on the Strip."}
{"text":"My friend Tina M and I came to Vegas because we both needed a quick getaway and this place was recommended by a non-yelper.

Oh man, the service is awful. Pros regarding service include quick seating (as long as you have a reservation) and quick money taking. Cons include waiting thirty minutes after you sit down to get your order taken (on a Sunday) and being really thirsty from nonexistant refills. Then when I mentioned it the waiter gave me attitude. 

The food is excellent. You have to be really really specific when it comes to asking for mild spices because if you are not used to a 4 alarm burning sensation you will be crying inside. I was after I ordered some drunken seafood noodles. Then again, the seafood was cooked perfectly and I forced myself to enjoy it to the point of my lips swelling up. I also ordered some beef rama from the Chef's selection on the last page of the menu that was very tender and delicious. YUM YUM YUMMMMM! 
Hey, they also make a really nice thai tea. 

To recap: don't come here when you're super hungry because you won't get fed for a while, but be prepared for awesomeness when you do."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for lunch. We didn't have reservations but it was a Monday during lunch so read others reviews saying it wouldn't be necessary, which it wasn't. 

We started with the egg rolls. We both thought it was just okay- nothing memorable. My friend ordered the drunken noodles with fried tofu (spice level 7 - we were raised on spicy Indian food and thought this was a good enough level to feel the heat and taste the food) and a Thai iced tea. She likes sweeter drinks so this was perfect for her. The drunken noodles had good flavor. I feel I have had better so this was a 4 out of 5 for me. 

I ordered the crispy duck in Penang sauce (spice level 7). The duck was nice and crispy and the sauce had good flavors. I would order this again. 

I would come back to try more items."}
{"text":"Friendly, safe, DELISH, and will come again

Kao soi: crispy duck with egg noodles. 
The curry was very balanced and stop tasty with the onion, pickles, and lime. The duck skin was so crispy but make sure it doesn't sit in the curry too long otherwise it will get soggy. 

The noodle amount was just right for one person!

Oh and I came by myself so it was just a 5 minute wait. 

Thai iced tea was refreshing but nothing too special. It balanced out my meal as a dessert. 

Total bill was $30 and personally I thought it was a bit expensive however definitely worth it."}
{"text":"It's true! It's all true! For quite some time now, I've been hearing and reading about how great the food at Lotus of Siam is. How it's one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. And, well... I tend to agree. 

Everything I have had at LoS has been amazing. The food here is delicious, and, as far as I know, pretty authentic. They're pretty heavy handed with the fresh chilies, that slight sweet tamarind flavor that I enjoy in Thai food is prevalent and not too sweet/overpowering like with many lesser places. That fresh, sourness from the citrus in their soups. I'm not sure I've actually had better Thai cuisine, anywhere. 

The dining room is... Bland and feels barren to me, with how large and white the space is, and how few adornments I can remember seeing, after you get through the waiting area (which is decorated with all sorts of awards and stuff, telling you how good the restaurant is, as if you, an avid yelper wouldn't already know). Perhaps my memory fails me here, though. They do have a beautiful wine room behind glass as, what I guess, I would consider the centerpiece of the dining area.

The service is straight forward. Very friendly. Not a finer level of service, but I don't expect white glove service with Thai cuisine.

Minus one star for the pothole riddled parking lot, in the hovel of a strip mall, that they're located in. Nothing that they can really control, but, it's hard to find, and I feel slightly uncomfortable the few times I've been there."}
{"text":"i have been coming here for the last 8 years or so.  i first heard of LOS in a gourmet magazine article and had to try what the craze among all the food critics was all about.  from the first time i ate there till the um-teenth time, it never disappoints.

i always stop by for lunch when i'm in las vegas.  i've enjoyed almost everything i've tried here...don't forget to try some of the northern thai items...the northern style larb and pork stew is especially good.  then finish the meal off with coconut ice cream and the coconut sticky rice with fresh mangos.

N.B. if you go for lunch, do not get the buffet.  you've been warned ;-)"}
{"text":"Update: 

On my recent trip to Vegas my husband and I ate here two nights in a row. Yes, I will admit it's the best thai food I've ever had. Perhaps the best food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Lotus of Siam for ages, finally made it . . . and I was underwhelmed. Sigh. 

Side note: if you find yourself in a sketchy strip mall and see a tiny storefront with a sign that says Lotus of Siam and are 70% sure you're in the wrong place, you're in the right place. 

Once you get inside, the restaurant is actually really big. Decor is nothing to speak of, but definitely better than the outside would lead you to believe. 

Prepare yourself--the menu is overwhelmingly huge. After consulting Yelp and getting advice from our server, we went with the garlic prawns, drunken noodle with mixed seafood, crispy duck curry, a small Singha and a Thai lime drink, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. Our bill, without tip, was almost $90. 

I don't have a problem paying good money for good food, but it just didn't seem like the price was warranted. Our meal was fine, but not outstanding. 

The garlic prawns has a great texture but seemed oily and didn't have as much flavor as I would have hoped. The prawns are pulled out of the shells, but the shells are left attached at the tail, so you have the prawn and shell separately deep fried. I would never known that you are supposed to eat the shells, but, thanks to good ol' Anthony Bourdain, my husband is more up on these sorts of things than I. The texture of the breading and the shell, and the flavor and crunch of the cabbage slaw with cilantro underneath the prawns, which was coated with garlicky goodness, were the best parts of this dish. 

The drunken noodles with mixed seafood weren't bad, but weren't better than any other drunken noodles I've had. 

The crispy duck curry was by far my favorite dish. Red panang curry, a generous serving of duck breast with perfectly crisped skin, and some red bell pepper. Most flavorful dish on the table, with a little bit of heat. 

I loved the Thai lime drink--basically limeade, tart and sweet but not too sweet, with a tiny salt. 

The sticky rice was meh, which was sad because sticky rice is one of my favorite things. Would've ordered it with mango, but they didn't have any, so went with coconut milk ice cream instead. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong things? Maybe they were having an off night? I don't know. The same meal for a more reasonable price would've gotten four stars from me, but it was way too expensive for what it was. 

The service was great. Shout out to Ettel--he was absolutely amazing! He wasn't our server, but took our drink orders and cleared our table, and was SO friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"For all the hype, I was really disappointed in this place. I ordered the Ginger Sea Bass Drunken Noodles with a spice level of 7/10. The fish had good flavor but the rest of the dish fell flat. It was not spicy at all. Yet another Thai restaurant paled in comparison to my favorite Ban Thai restaurant in White Bear Lake, MN."}
{"text":"I must say, I was pretty excited to try \"The Best Thai Restaurant in North America\" after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Since we didn't make a reservation for our party of 8, the boy and I made a mad dash to the restaurant early to see if we could still get a table. They just opened for dinner (at 5pm), but the restaurant was pretty much filled already. Luckily, they had a large table open at the moment, so they let the two of us sit down first. (Some restaurants won't even seat you unless your whole party is there, so that was pretty nice!)

We sat there waiting for our friends for 10-15 minutes (which we felt really bad about), but they didn't seem annoyed at all, whew! After flipping through the menu, we ordered ten dishes. 

- Stuffed Chicken Wings: sliced chicken wings - crispy, flavorful, and served with sweet and sour sauce
- Nam Kao Tod: crispy rice - very interesting, you have to try if you've never had crispy rice before!
- Nam-Prik-Hed: spicy mushroom dip - spicy! but meh, at least the veggies that comes with it was kind of cleansing to the palette
- Sai Oua: northern style sausage - were alright
- Garlic Prawns: BOMB DOT COM. THIS IS A NECESSITY!
- Yellow Curry and Red Curry: very flavorful
- Drunken Noodle Seafood: pretty delicious!
- Pad Se-Ew: typical
- Crispy Duck: cooked perfectly

Their Thai Iced Tea was pretty refreshing! And because some of the food came out slower, they offered us a free Thai Iced Tea.

We got two orders of mango sticky rice and one order of fried bananas. Both were delicious! (I've had better sticky rice though..) 

They also have a HUGE selection of wine! So if you're a wine lover, you're in for a treat!

Overall, great atmosphere, great service, and great food (will have good dreams about those garlic prawns tonight). So take your date there or just go have dinner with your friends. It's perfect!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant. Food is fresh and tasty. Meats and veggies cooked perfectly. Great wine selection and friendly service. About 10 min. from the strip in an older strip mall area. Forget the buffets when in Vegas eat here instead."}
{"text":"A friend insisted we visit this restaurant on our trip to Vegas and now we can't wait to visit again just to come back here...

-Spicy seabass- this was good even without the spicy sauce which they put on the side, but I recommend adding the sauce for spicy.  Excellent either way.
-Beef Rama- incredibly well prepared beef with peanut sauce, delish to the last bite!
-Fried crab over drunken noodles- I'm not a fried food fan but even I concede that this dish was excellent.  My mom's first experience with rice noodles: a huge success!  While the drunken noodles, as always, were at times a bit stuck together, the sauce was well slathered throughout.  Tasty.

Be warned- the menu is very, very long.  We flipped straight to the back to the Northern section but I daresay there was plenty in the other parts of the menu for us to order and I think we need to visit possibly 12-15 times to cover everything I would like to check out.

The servers were all quick and efficient.  And kudos to the greeting team- I called to let them know we would be arriving over an hour before our (7:30pm) reservation and they said feel free to come but we have many parties ahead of you.  When we arrived, we waited a grand total of 7 minutes to be seated.  Incredible!  Thank you so much, Lotus of Siam, for such excellent customer service!

...and wonderful food.  We truly can't wait to dine with you again!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's everything it should be, and more. Food has spot on flavor, nice and hot. I've gone three times, each time I've left satisfied. I'm big on soup and this place masters at them, I recommend the coconut chicken soup. After that venture out and try anything because I'm under the impression that everything they serve is delicious. One of the best if not the best restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were told to arrive early so we arrived before they opened. The outside of the restaurant is a little seedy but the inside is completely different with very efficient and friendly wait staff.
The yellow curry was the best I've ever had outside of Thailand. The tom yum soup was divine. I wish we had this kind of Thai food in the east coast!"}
{"text":"a Big Appointment, don't believe the hype....The Buffet is sub standard.....The soup was cold....The Steamed dumplings were under cooked and cold...plus the prawns tasted like Kentucky fried Chicken.....To top it off , alot of the dishes are over priced............The buffet at the Palms ,Thai food section was  better"}
{"text":"My father actually took me here for the first time and I returned on my next trip to Vegas because I enjoyed it so much.  The food is very good (though I am no connoisseur of Thai cuisine) and they have a really nice wine selection."}
{"text":"We ordered and shared several dishes including roasted duck curry and the crispy rice app. It was all delicious."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever made a trip to Las Vegas without making a stop here for the best Thai food I've had with the caveat of having never traveled to Thailand. Best in its class at what is still a very fair price. Our go-to favorites are the Nam kao tod, Khao soi, one of their various catfish dishes, and Tom kha soup. If you're willing to splurge a little more, the garlic prawns and crispy duck dishes on the back menu will absolutely linger in the back of your mind until you make your way back here again.
Online reservations make things easier now but otherwise show up before opening time to get seats without any trouble."}
{"text":"Firstly, let me say that Lotus of Siam is housed in one of the most bizarre strip malls I have ever visited.  Here you will find two gay bathhouses (a.k.a. spa/health clubs), two wig shops, one 420 cafe, several evangelical and pentecostal churches, a roller hockey rink, a reggae club, a BDSM supplies/goth clothing store, an Alcoholics Together meeting space, and numerous Asian restaurants/clubs, all seemingly harmoniously coexisting.

I had high hopes for LoS after reading the foodie blogs.  We arrived on a Sat night around 7:30p sans reservation and entertained ourselves by walking around the strip mall during our 30 minute wait.  The staff was courteous.  Prices were a bit higher and portions were smaller than you'd find in Thai Town in Hollywood or at LoS's sister restaurant Renu Nakorn (Norwalk, CA).  We ordered two Issan specialties, kang hoh and nam kao tod (medium spicy), in addition to mango sticky rice and Thai iced coffee.  The kang hoh was less vinegary than Renu Nakorn's (a good thing), but contained something resembling overcooked beef stew meat, not pork as listed on the menu.  The nam kao tod was likewise somewhat disappointing - heavy on the rice with small cubes of purchased sausage.  Maybe I'm used to the nam kao tod at Khun Dom (Hollywood, CA), but I prefer it heavy on the fresh ginger and prepared with seasoned ground pork and pork skin with the rice as more of a topping.  Neither dish was in the least bit spicy and appeared on the table too fast to be prepared freshly upon our order.  The food seemed sadly farangified."}
{"text":"This was probably the only proper meal I had during my bachelorette trip to Vegas besides Monta Ramen. Great Thai food! Not light handed on the spice so be warned. It's off the strip by cab in a lonely looking shopping mall and there's most likely going to be a wait, but it's definitely worth the wait. Anything you order will be good, but my fave was the Thai fried rice. I know, pretty typical, but isn't that how you judge how good a place is - by the standard dishes? At least that's my method. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lotus is one of the most beloved Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and I am definitely a fan.  Their curries are truly delicious and their pad see ew is also great.  Friends I have gone with heartily agree that the food is overall amazing.  I have eaten here perhaps 4 times and while I do like it, I chose 4 starts instead of 5 because: a) their portions are smaller than other thai restaurants and sometimes I feel like I could have eaten more, b) I had the spicy mushroom dip with blanched vegetables there the other night and was underwhelmed by it (despite it being advertised on the menu as loved by vegetarians)."}
{"text":"located in some random semi-seedy asian strip mall.  food here was tasty and a relief from the expensive dining prices on the strip. go ahead and order:
spicy chicken wings
seabass over drunken noodle
the crispy duck was mostly skin and not as much meat
the crispy mussel omelet was good but a little too fried
hyped up but a satisfying meal"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I have to come here now. We came at 9pm on a Saturday and we waited about 10-15 minutes for a party of 2. It's a little off the strip, but well worth it! The service was great, our server helped us a lot in judging how much food we should order. We ended up ordering 4 dishes to share: spicy chicken wings, tom yum koong (shrimp), thai basil beef, and beef pad see ew. The chicken wings were amazing!! They weren't too spicy, more like a sweet chili, and they were served hot and crispy! The tom yum was by far the best tom yum I've ever had. It was spicy and tangy - perfection! The thai basil beef was very light and a solid dish as well. It went well with steamed white rice. The beef pad see ew was also great, just wish there were more greens added in! 

This place operates very efficiently, our food came out no more than 10 minutes after we ordered it and every dish was hot and fresh! The spicy chicken wings are something you HAVE to order!"}
{"text":"So my sister-in-law really likes Thai food. But we're in Vegas for her soon-to-be husband's bachelor party, so she's not my sister-in-law yet. Think that's confusing? Ask yourself why the best Thai food in Las Vegas is in a Korean strip mall?

So I'm meeting my brother's future in-laws for the first time. There's about a dozen of them, and we're at Lotus of Siam. Somehow we got reservations for Easter dinner, because if we didn't have reservations, we'd still be waiting outside for a table.

I'm not the most adventurous eater. I'm a fan of Thai food, but I'm fine with the dishes I know and love. Lotus of Siam has a lot of northern Thai dishes that aren't served at most Thai restaurants, and a lot of seafood dishes. I wanted some chicken with basil and a green curry. Both were very good. Neither changed my worldview. Future sister-in-law couldn't remember what Thai dishes she liked. Her future husband remembered and ordered for her. That's why they're married now.

So if all you know about Trinidad is that Obama just visited there, you might not know that Trinis love spicy food. S-i-l's father makes his own hot sauce every two weeks because he uses so much of it. He loved the food here. S-i-l's cousin couldn't stand the spice in his cup of soup. This is why when the server asks you how spicy you want your food, you have to pay attention and not try to impress anyone. Our server (who may very well have been the owner) tried very hard to please a table full of people most of whom had never eaten Thai food before. She largely succeeded.

So my recommendation would be to come to Lotus of Siam if you like Thai food, if you're interested in dishes that you can't get in most other restaurants, or if you like really spicy food. If you're a Thai fan, order one thing you would normally get, and then branch out to one thing on the menu that sounds good but you've never tried. If you throw in some appetizers, you'll certainly not go home hungry. I was stuffed, and wished I had ordered something besides my usuals.

Reservations are important, especially for large parties. The decor is not fancy, although there are enough celebrity photographs on the walls to make you thing you're in the Pink's in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"We love this place, and it's not just because this is where we went on our first date.  The food is always so yummy.  Everything I have ever ordered has been fantastic.  The service is great.  The wine list is extensive, and amazing!  Make a reservation for sure!"}
{"text":"Superb. I think it's one of the best Thai places in Vegas. My husband thinks it was good but nothing to rave about. But his opinion doesn't matter because this is my review. Hahahaha definitely order the:
1. Sea bass (fried) with the kucio (sp?) sauce 
2. Crispy duck 
3. Garlic prawns

Definitely come there 10-15 minutes before it opens bc long lines start before that. Try to make reservations way in advance. We tried to do that a day before and they said they weren't taking reservations anymore.  I don't know if that means they were so booked they couldn't take any more reservations or if it meant they don't take them at all.

Food comes out super fast . Service is excellent . I will be returning every Vegas trip. And drag husband along. Because his opinion does not matter. Hahha"}
{"text":"If you want great Thai food and you're in Las Vegqs this is the place to go. I've dined at this busy place several times and have never been disappointed. 

Don't be fooled by the small green sign outside. Located in a strip mall with decent parking, the restaurant is large and has three rooms. It can become very busy and I'm told wait times can be 45 minutes or longer. Having said that I've never had to wait.

The menu is huge. And the waiters careful to prepare your food to your \"spicy tolerance\" (I just made that up but I know the word \"spicy\" when in Thailand means your skin turns red and tears flow down your face). 

Service is okay. The restaurant can be very busy and the waiters and servers appropriately attentive.

I have to admit I was a little disappointed by my yellow chicken curry dish. It looked and felt smaller than what I usually enjoy at Thai restaurants. However I dined with a group of seven and we all loved the experience and the prices were very reasonable.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. We came for dinner and it was so good that we grabbed lunch here before we skipped town. 

Service was friendly. They gave good suggestions. 

The hot and sour soup had my mouth on fire for 10 minutes though."}
{"text":"STOP! DONT READ ANYTHING ON THE MENU BEFORE THE FOURTH PAGE. 
The fourth page had only Northern Thailand Cuisine.
I stayed in Chiang Mai for five months and upon returning home maintained an appetite for the food. Couldnt find it... 
Lotus of Siam hosts an impeccable wine selection and amazing food. If youre in Vegas get away from the strip... visit this ugly strip mall... and enjoy an amazing meal"}
{"text":"They open at 5:30.  No answering service or machine to leave a msg. or reservation.  So the phone stays busy until forever.  Going somewhere else where they can take a reservation or embrace some kind of technology.

Ok.  With so many stars I tried and got through my 5th try.  We had 5 dishes.  Panang Curry with duck was the best Thai dish I've ever eaten.   And I love Thai."}
{"text":"By far the best Larb salad I've had in my life. I could eat this Larb every meal of every day it was so damn good! The spices and flavors of this Larb tasted so good without the line juice. I'll be dreaming of this until I have it again!"}
{"text":"I had tried on 3 previous occasions to eat here but the wait was unacceptable.  I stopped by for lunch on my last trip to Vegas.  During the week they have a lunch buffet so I asked the host whether, my first time there, I should order off the menu or get the buffet.  He suggested ordering off the menu.  So I chose my normal red curry with chicken, medium heat.  The curry was good, I thought a bit mild for medium, but then I chomped down on a chunk of jalapeno that I thought was bell pepper that was not listed as an ingredient.  The only thing other than the chicken was some bamboo shoots and some basil and of course a whole jalapeno cut lengthwise. Also ordering off the menu takes a lot longer to get service and food. If I am in the area I may go to try the buffet as there seemed to be many regular customers taking part.  So far though I am very unimpressed, especially given the hype, and there are two other Thai restaurants I would prefer in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best Pad Thai I've had thus far! The portion is fantastic, the #7 spice level was on point and the entire dish was VERY flavorful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Holy spicy and deliciousness. 

Portions are super small therefore rendering the prices to be pretty expensive. Very authentic Thai food. One of the best Thai meals I've had. 

Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles is where it is at! Love. Other deliciousness what was devoured included panaga curry, beef drunken noodles, pork satay, and pineapple fried rice.

Most of the boys in our group left hungry."}
{"text":"Everything I had was fantastic and the service is excellent.  Only issue was how busy it was I had to make a reservation well in advance.   Not a big fan of the location, but well worth the travel to have such great food."}
{"text":"This place is very deceiving, everything around it looks janky and the outside doesn't even seem like it would be nice but when you walk inside its like you stepped into another world. You walk inside and its really nice, they have a huge space and wine selection. The servers here are so laser focused they give such good hospitality, they're so nice and give amazing service.  It's best to make reservations before you come otherwise you'll have to wait for 1 hour or longer. 

We ordered the Stuffed Chicken, Tom yum soup, Red curry, garlic prawns, and the pad thai. The stuffed chicken is nice and crispy and wasn't dry. It's served with sweet chilli sauce on the side and its very well balanced. The tom yum soup was all the elements of what a thai soup was supposed to be, sweet, sour, and savory. For those of you that can't take spicy foods too much, I suggest ordering anything that's spicy at the level 4 or lower. At a level 4 it feels like a level 8 and I occasionally eat spicy stuff. Garlic prawns were amazing and they fry the shell as well, everything is crunchy and they also devain the shrimp so you just get a nice big shrimp with a lot of garlic flavor. Red curry is good too like any other thai curry. The pad thai was really light and wasn't super sweet. You can taste sweet, sour, and savory but it's not like the super sweet pad thai noodles you'll get if you go to a thai restaurant back in LA.  Def order to share, and would come back next time to try the crispy duck :) 

This place has lived up to its hype and will be coming back next time. There's plenty of parking around but if you don't have access there's plenty of lyft and uber drivers around"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best (if not the best) Thai places I've been to. I make it a point to visit Lotus of Siam every time I visit LV. Please *please* order something special off their expansive menu, and not just stick with the ho-hum. The flavors are multifaceted, and not just overpowered by one spice... Though I do have one story to tell.....

So, I ate here once a couple of years ago with my wife and our Joisey friends. Everyone else were pansies and ordered a \"3\" or \"4\" spiciness for their dishes, and of course I ordered an \"8\" for my Kang Hoh - a stir-fry pork dish with different veggies sprinkled about. I was having the greatest time with it... until I bit into this orange pepper. It took about half a second before my whole body went berserk. Apparently, if you order an \"8\", they cook the dish with habaneros, then they were supposed to take it out. But they missed one. Let's just say that this lone pepper hurt me again and again for the next 12 hours. And I was the butt of all jokes for the rest of the trip."}
{"text":"They got rid of the all you can eat- but still a great place to go for food!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place more frequently and always loved there lunch buffet but this time we came back it was not there any more . I was so disappointed with our visit first we sat at our table for more the 15 min before anyone came to us and then we asked for water with lemon and it took about another 5 min to get the lemon had to ask several times for it. Our service was horrible we waited about 30 min to get our food and during that time the waiter never came to the table to check up on us well he didn't come up to us the whole time  we were there we had to look for him . When it was time to order dessert that took about another 20 min and again the waiter never came to apologize for the wait he didn't even look at us every time he passed the table it was like we weren't even there . I used to love this place but I don't think I will be going back . I gave it 3 stars only because I know how good it used to be otherwise I would give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"Another wonderful dining experience here. First time in the new location, and it was great. Came with out of town friends who loved it as well. Entrees were a variety of seafood and vegetarian, all were great."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in Las Vegas!
During your next trip to Vegas, I highly suggest you venture off the strip to a ghetto strip mall in a dumpy area full of transients. When you arrive inside Lotus of Siam, you will be pleasantly surprised. This place is casual, family friendly, spacious, clean, and has great service

You will not find better Thai food anywhere in the world unless you're in Thailand. 
It's been deemed year after year as the best Thai restaurant in North America, and that's no exaggeration. 

I ordered the Panang Crispy Duck Curry, Beef Pad See Ewe, and Stuffed Chicken wings. Each dish was a flavor explosion, and culinary delight. Prices are very reasonable, and affordable. 

We took our rental car here from the strip and it's a quick easy 10 minute drive. Otherwise, it's probably about a 20 dollar cab ride each way."}
{"text":"This is the best thai restaurant hands down.. the service is pristine.. food is top notch every time.. must order is the garlic prawn.. I myself do not like shrimps or prawns.. but oh boy I did some major damage.. keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"I actually wanted to give only 4.5 stars but there are no half stars on Yelp!  Don't you hate it when that happens?

I went to Vegas during MLK Day weekend with my boyfriend and two friends.  Had fun, ate a lot, gambled a lot, drank a lot.  What a great way to end our weekend here at Lotus of Siam.

We went for lunch around 12pm on MLK Day on our way back to Orange County.  We were a bit fearful (or at least I was) of our luggage being in the car as we ate since the plaza looks really ghetto.  We got there a bit too late being as there was a group of extremely eager eaters who got there about half a second before us and took the last open table.  The wait wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews here.  We waited for only about 10 or 15 minutes for a table.  But, being as hungry as we all were, that wait seemed like an eternity.

We ordered pad thai, papaya salad, a red curry dish, fried tofu, and beef salad (I think it was the #58 or something).  Pad thai was amazing!  One of the best I've ever had.  The papaya salad was good too, but I've had better at some other Thai restaurants.  The red curry dish was good, but it is spicier than you will expect it to be.  My favorite of them all was the FRIED TOFU!  it's just deep fried tofu with I think what was a sweet and sour sauce with peanuts.  It doesn't sound very fancy, but the sauce just makes the dish complete.  The tofu is of the right crispness and it just melts in your mouth.  The beef salad was only mediocre in comparison to the other dishes.

I only want to deduct half a star because first, there were no mangoes for the sticky rice w/mango dish, which I was half expecting.  Second, when I asked for fried banana with the dish instead of the mango, they didn't have the sticky rice!!! But do not fear.  I left still happy and satisfied. 

We have made this a staple for any Vegas trips in the future :)"}
{"text":"Heard lots of great things about this place. I've been trying to visit this restaurant every time I come back to Vegas, but it has been hard. Plus this was before they moved, but now they've moved! And I finally got to check this place out. Reservations were all booked on a MONDAY. My friends and I were thinking it shouldn't be toooo busy, but it stilll was on a MONDAY!  We had to do a walk-in.. but luckily when we walked in, waiting for a table was about a 35 minute wait, but they said we could sit at the bar side and order there and low and behold - there was a table that could fit all 5 of my friends and I! So we decided to sit there and order food. Our server was super helpful and patient - we had 5 hungry females not knowing what to get and kept asking questions and kind of took forever to select our dishes. 

* Garlic Prawn - HUGE shrimp,garlic, tasty, and crunchy 
* Drunken Noodles - Nothing special from a normal drunken noods
* Crispy Duck - Super flavorful, the sauce tastes good ontop of rice and other items we picked
* Chicken Larb - a tad salty
* Mixed Veggies - This had flavor

I wasn't super amazed of the food where it was nothing special from other Thai places I've been. I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items though...nothing that stood out that I would HIGHly recommend, except maybe the garlic prawn."}
{"text":"Came in on a thursday lunch.  the place was filled got the garlic prawns and green curry both were amazing"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is located in a random lot off the strip, but don't let that deter you! Yes, you have to wait, but if you stick it out you will be rewarded! We had a party of 8 on a Wednesday night and the wait was around 1.5 hours. Luckily you can put your name in ahead of time on their website under \"Reservations\". 

After waiting around the bar with a couple of beers we were seated in the back room and left to peruse the lengthy menu.  We ordered a bunch of things, but here were my favorites:

Crispy Duck Khao Soi: Must get. The khao soi had great, full bodied-flavor and the crispy duck  was DELICIOUS. Seriously couldn't stop going for more, long after my jean buttons were begging for mercy. I honestly have nothing else to say except that you should definitely order it. 

Beef Penang: This is my staple Thai dish and I thought their version was good. Not mind-blowing, but I think I'm just biased because this is my favorite dish. My fellow diners thought it was absolutely delicious!

Cold Jackfruit Salad: I don't remember the actual name of this dish, but it was jackfruit with ground pork and lime juice (among other things) served cold with slices of raw garlic. Although this dish is admittedly a little funky (as jackfruit inherently is), once I got used to it, I kept going back. The raw garlic is a little intimidating at first, but it actually really complements the flavors of the jackfruit and almost tones them down a little. 

Tofu Pad See Eew: Another staple dish just done really well. You can choose how you'd like the tofu cooked and we went with deep fried, because Vegas baby! Even the carnivores at the table were raving about how good it was.

Service was good, considering how busy they are! Can't wait to come back sometime and try the other northern specialties!"}
{"text":"I took a group of 12 friends there based on the recommendation of a friend.... It was some of the blandest Thai food I have ever had. 

The Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. 

The Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.

The Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.

The Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? 

The Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. 

The saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.

All this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food. I think this must be the case for a lot of the positive reviews here. An other negative reviewer pointed out that there simply no Thai people in there this does tend to be a good indicator as to if a Thai place is good."}
{"text":"After years of wanting to try out the famous Lotus of Siam, we finally did it! YES! I was able to make a reservation for their new location and it was a consensus amongst our group that this was probably the best meal we had in Las Vegas 

I'll keep this short. LOS is known for their Northern Thai cuisine! Yes, they have the standard flare of pad thai and pad see yew and all that, but you can get that anywhere. Dont be a basic B and order pad thai and eggrolls here. Ask the server and see what is recommended by the chef and just skip to the latter half of the menu. The menu can be super overwhelming, but trust the wait staff and just go for something new.

The one dish that everyone rave about is the Fried Garlic Prawns. Yes, it's like $30 for 7 pieces of shrimp, but girl, this is worth it. Soo good. Super crispy, very flavorful, just a treat. Other than that, another standout dish was the Pork Stew dish (listed under the northern thai section), the Larb (norther thai style), and this duck curry dish. We also got to try their chili dips, which, if you can't handle spicy, might not be the best option for you. FYI, if you order curry or anything like that, they serve a majority of dishes with white rice. So unless you want an additional order of stick rice, you dont need more rice. 

I would say that this is best-approached family style. This way, you can try more items. The dishes and flavors were all so unique and they have such a great use of herbs. Also, since they still dont have a liquid license, you can BYOB!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could give Lotus of Siam 10 stars. It's that good!!!! 

Don't let the exterior or location off the strip fool you. Lotus of Siam is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas (and I'm a vegas native), hands down. It's quite possibly my favorite restaurant period. I follow them on instagram and just drool over every photo.

My typical experience begins with Tom Yum soup with shrimp. We get a pot for the whole table. I can honestly say you've never had Tom Yum soup like this. You can taste each ingredient separately, but also all together. It's a symphony in your mouth!!!

I always have a hard time deciding what to get for an entree. The sea bass drunken noodle!!!! Is the best thing ever. The tom Yum noodle soup (yes, double the tom yum). I once read a review that said that the noodle soup is to tom Yum what bouillabaisse is to fish stock. All the curries are amazing. The crisp duck curries are also very popular.

On the northern menu, there is a delicious vermicelli bowl!!!! You can ask for it without tripe.  

Next time I'm going to try the soft shell crab! 

They also have an award winning wine list.

The prices are incredible reasonable ranging from 9-15 on average with the sea bass and crab items in the high 20s low 30s. 

You will need to get a reservation a few days in advance, OR you can show up 15 mins before they open at 5:30 and be seated immediately.  I can't speak to their buffet.

Do not miss out. Make this a stop on your Vegas trip."}

{"text":"I found this place via Yelp and was also influenced by magazine articles about good and reasonable food outside the Strip.Taxi from and back to our hotel (Mirage) was speedy and reasonably priced.

There was a short line to get in and the wait was not very long. the restaurant was crowded and reminded me of other nicely decorated Thai restaurants. However, stacks of boxes could be seen in the bar area.

The Panang curry was excellent. Great mix of heat, salty (fish sauce) and sweet(sugar added usually). The crunchy duck was a greaat contrast to the Panang curry and I really enjoyed it.

Ordered Nam Kao Tod a \"crispy rice\" dish and it was unusual and quite a surprise due to the sausage. 

Ordered the sweet and sour fish (whole pompano) and it was excellent. the sauce is so unique...haven't figured out what makes it so.

Will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"The Lotus of Siam will have 401 reviews after I finish writing this... that means it doesn't really need my props (already has 4 stars) but, it's SO DELICIOUS that I have to write a Yelp up anyway.  

It's my favorite Thai in all of Vegas... kinda in all of the USA.  My friend and I stopped in when we were up last week and, I wanted to return again the next night so I could order the same thing... the green curry.  Her pad thai was good too but, it had nothing on my green curry.  This was my first time trying it.  Everything I try there is always delicious.  It's so delicious and still really reasonably priced.  

Eater beware: they do spice the Thai way so be careful when you say 'medium'... you better mean spicy!

Definitely definitely see ya there!"}

i don't even like thai food,

actually i hate thai food,

because most of the time, thai restaurants only serve pad thai, tom yum soupy stuff,

and blah blah dish with the same spicy and lemony seasoning.

BUT

this place is a FOOD WONDERLAND.

DONT CARE, how long you have to WAIT.

DON\"T CARE, how far you must TRAVEL.

GO HERE.

i HAVE to visit this place every year that i'm in Las Vegas,

this place is a FOODIE MECCA.

It calls to me in my sleep.

ALL HAIL THE LOTUS OF SIAM.

(advisory warning: many dishes are spicy , and if you can't eat spicy, I feel bad for you)."}
{"text":"There's not a lot I can add to all the rave reviews about Lotus, except to echo them - go give this place a try!!  There is more to Vegas than the Strip....

I had to laugh at the descriptions of the location  - yes, it looks like you could be arranging a drug deal or two - but inside nirvana is waiting, so just ignore the shady neighbourhood.   

Favs for me were the curries, but I'd love to return on my next visit to Vegas and try things that are new to me from their extensive menu - or maybe leave it up to the waiters to surprise me  ;-)"}
{"text":"Prepare to make love to your food.

The tom kah Kai soup -- the flavors are so complimentary. So distinct. I could eat this almost daily. You must get at least a cup. I split a cup with a friend and it was perfect.

Had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab. Was good but I was almost more surprised by how not in love I was. It was ok. Good but I would definitely get something else next time."}
{"text":"After hearing this was the best Thai place in Vegas, I had to check it out! While their signature dish (garlic prawns) was good, I'd have to say my fav by far was the khao soi with roasted duck. The duck was so crispy despite being in the delicious sauce. We also had the tom kha kai (good and tangy) and papaya salad (too spicy!), topped off with the fried banana (not bad, a little too much fried wrapper) and coconut ice cream (not good nor worth it). Would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area (make a reservation!) and heads up it's located in a rundown strip mall (kinda hard to find even with gps)."}
{"text":"Nothing compares except the motherland. Everything we ordered and order every time never fails to tickle our tastebuds."}
{"text":"Take away the hype and rave reviews, and you will see that Lotus of Siam delivers solid Thai food.

For years, I had heard only great things about Lotus of Siam.  I have had my fair share of Thai food so I did not understand how one place could be so highly regarded.  While I could honestly say I was not blown away by anything I tried, I did enjoy the flavors and the service leaving me with a great dining experience.  Plus, their menu is pretty extensive so if I am in Vegas again, I am ready to make another trip to try some of their other items.

Here are some of the things that I tried on my first trip:

Nam Kao Tod: A crispy rice dish that sizzles with heat and flavor.  Each kernel of rice was almost fried to a crisp in an oil with a mixture of peppers and spices.  They provide several slices of cabbage and cucumber which help provide a nice counterbalance to the rice.  

Garlic Prawns: Given the high regard for these, here I was a little underwhelmed.  When the dish arrives, you will see the piece of meat hanging from the shell, all of which had been fried to a nice crisp.  While it smells absolutely like something you would come to expect from a dish called garlic prawns, the meat itself was a little lacking in that garlic flavor.  The true flavor actually came from the shell itself which was not necessarily as enjoyable to bite into.  

Roasted Duck Curry: A balance of spicy and sweet with generous pieces of duck make this a recommend.  Sure, in terms of flavor, it is what you would come to expect from your usual curries.  However, the actually chunks that were in the curry were impressive - fresh and vibrant. 

In terms of service, they were really great.  The servers were very attentive to our needs and would do things to make sure everything was okay.  The parking lot is huge so no worries about that but you may have to worry about the wait.  It is usually recommended to make reservations which is possible online.  If you are unable to secure a reservation online, you can put your name on the waitlist online as well.  Make sure to arrive on time or you risk losing your spot in line!

Overall, Lotus of Siam does have good Thai food that is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!

came here for lunch and service was top notch! staff was super friendly. the place was super clean and well, when i first walked in i was like oh no this place is going to be super expensive. i should've looked at the yelp reviews more closely. but HA, fooled me. prices was super reasonable. 

ordered:
*beef pad thai
*yen ta fo
*chicken larb
*combination fried rice
*panang

first off, i can't tell you how impressed our party of 5 was with every dish that arrived on the table. everything was just well flavored and seasoned. 
with every dish that we tried as soon as we put the spoon or fork in our mouth we turned to each other eyes opened wide and did a nod. happy party of 5 we were! :)  portion is a bit on the small side but if you order a lot its enough to still do family style. now, lotus of siam can you please open up a location in LA? LA needs YOU!!

so, my yelper... if you are looking for authentic thai food off the strip than lotus of siam is your place. this place does get packed so be forewarned. however, its worth the wait for good tasting food.

tips:
*restroom available
*has its own private lot
*alcohol available
*high chair available 
*indoor seating only
*credit card and cash accepted
*they have a website
*was featured on the food network
*reservation accepted."}
{"text":"Good food, but the line.... uhh... the line. Waited long to get seats :)"}
{"text":"Best thai food I had, very authentic.

Remember to book the seat early, or go there before They open. Otherwise the wait will be long."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Thai places and this one is one of the best I've every been to!  The Nam Prik Ong was awesome and the drunken noodles with Prawns was amazing!  It's in the ghetto around the corner from where the old Sahara hotel was but well worth the drive off the strip to eat here!  In fact, one of our friends who lives in Vegas told us that there wasn't any good Thai places in Vegas.  We took him here and boy was he proved wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!
I visit this place every time that I am in Vegas, wonderful food, I never had a bad dish. The downside, the wait, this time we waited for a table almost two hours, they recommend you to make a reservation but, nobody ever answers the phones, so just be patience and have a drink at the bar while you wait. After you are seated the food comes very fast. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped by while passing through Las Vegas. Great food, with some creative dishes. They have a very large menu with plenty of choices. Glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"I refused to go back to Los Angeles until I have Lotus of Siam. It is by far the BEST Thai food that I have ever had! My boyfriend has been asking to go here for the longest time... and in my head.. Im thinking... whats the big deal.. its just THAI food.... omg..  was I wrong!! The food is sooooo amazingly orgasmic! 

What to order:

Panang curry - chicken or duck... whatever protein.. still bomb.

Crispy Duck Drucken Noodles - the noodles are so good here.. you can tell it is the real deal.

GARLIC CRISPY SHRIMP - if you don't order this... I have no words for you. 

TIP: Go during their lunch hour.. its not as busy.... if you go for dinner... be there at 5pm before doors open at 530. My boyfriend and I got there at 545pm... and had to wait for 1 hour. 

Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and worth the wait. They open at 5:30pm Sundays - we walked in at 6:00pm and it was a 35 minute wait. But it was delicious and totall worth it! THE standout dish, however, was a cp of the En Tuan Soup (#22) on the menu: \"Spicy and sour soup with beef tendon, bean sprouts and beef slices.\" Don't let the word \"tendon\" scare you away. Eat around that part if you like and savor the wonderful broth. It's worth coming here just to have this!"}
{"text":"I love food new location are very pretty .. better than old one .. food is good as old place drinking noodle with seabass & garlic shrimp are Best."}
{"text":"This place is not in the best area, but the food is worth the trip. 

We will usually order:

THE LOBSTER (comes out to about 7lbs)
Garlic Prawns
Beef Salad
Pad Thai
Crab Fried Rice
Satay 
Tom Yum Koon
and can forget the Sticky rice, fried bananas, coconut ice cream and mango slices (seasonal) 

Def worth a trip away from the strip! 

Compared to all the crappy white table cloth joints inside of these hotels this is a place where you will return. 

PS There wine selection is comparable to most of the high end restaurants in these hotels."}
{"text":"Wow! What a delicious restaurant. Also a home to a surprisingly extensive collection of wine in a beautiful display right in the center of the restaurant. Anyway I had some hot and sour soup to start and it was very flavorful. Dinner was a yellow curry and I tasted a friend's pad Thai. All of it was very flavorful. Only downside of the dinner was that we were sat in the furthest back table of the restaurant and the service was pretty slow. Outside of that it was good enough that I'll certainly return!"}
{"text":"This place would never work in New York because so many people would jam themselves in here that it would explode.

I love basil chili minced chicken. It's called gra praow or something. They have it here and it's great.

I also had some weird northern pork sausage dish that I ordered because it looked weird and it was also great

Good wine list. Very fair prices. Lots of options.

All the people in the kitchen look like they are working in a hospital. Just another indication that quality is very important here.

Entrees are about $11. Generous portions by my standards. I ate 1.5 entrees because I'm a glutton for excellent Thai food.

Medium spicy was enough to make me sweat

Best meal I have had in Vegas on my own dime"}
{"text":"This place get cracking! Its in a rough spot of town but don't let it scare ya! I've on a Thai kick lately. They recommend you to make a reservation here but unfortunately I did not make one. But I wanted to try their Larb dish. Been craving it lately ha. So right when i enter I was greeted. I ordered my food to go. I got the Larb/Pork. I was told it'll be ready about 15 minutes. I waited near the entrance and my food came. I could smell it already and can't wait to eat it. It was so good, very flavorful, the spice was right where I like it to be level 4. It was comes with cucumbers and cabbage to eat with. You can eat this with rice. I definitely will be making a reservation back."}
{"text":"I went here after watching Bourdain's episode on Vegas and I wasn't disappointed. The golden fried garlic prawns in particular were incredible. We went here at 1pm on a Thursday and the place was packed with locals. We had the nam prik ong, the crispy rice rice salad, the jackfruit vegetable curry, golden fried prawns and the house special fried rice and another item that Bourdain ate (don't remember it now)  Everythign was great. I'd recommend to not get the crispy rice salad to go, because...well.. it doesnt stay crispy."}
{"text":"Brought a visiting friend here for a relaxed dinner before putting her on the RedEye.  Place was packed early on a Monday, and for good reason.  Absolutely divine.  As other reviewers have mentioned the Crispy Duck Panang is perfection, though, I ordered a level \"6\" spice and I could have gone up a couple of notches.  Prices are totally reasonable- 2 soup, 2 entree, 4 beers came out to under $70 including tip (and we had leftovers).  Service was prompt but not rushed and very friendly.  Ambiance is somewhat lacking, but food, service and value totally make up the difference."}
{"text":"Very tough to find because it's in a dumpy strip mall. But it was very busy and amazing food. We Had ton tom yum kai soup appetizer which was fantastic. The pad Thai noodle dish was great.  The drunken noodles  were fantastic with large whole shrimp in then.  The seafood fried rice was fantastic with vegetables and large shrimp. This is a amazing spot. Larp was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food but a little on the crowded side for me. Ambiance 2 stars becuase of the lack of personal space and small seating. Although the food is great it is hard to enjoy when stuffed in a room. So food 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a hidden gem in LV! The plaza seems pretty empty and run down; however, the restaurant gets pretty packed. We stopped by at lunch time on a Monday, and the restaurant quickly filled up. We ordered the crispy garlic prawns, crispy duck panang curry, and drunken noodle with soft shelled crab. If you can handle spicy food, definitely tell your server a number greater than 5 for the level of spiciness. I would recommend that you come with a large party so that you can order multiple dishes and dine \"family-style.\""}
{"text":"They had a large collection of wine and it gets really crowded. The wait time could go on for hours, but I was lucky my friend and I made it just before their \"rush hour.\" Ordered curries and thai tea and it was satisfying. Definitely recommend going. What's lacking may be their service since they're so busy."}
{"text":"Panang curry is amazing- So many flavors!! Lots of veggie options. Thai coffee is also very good. Service is kinda mixed - 5 mins to get our food; 15 mins to get our to go order and check."}
{"text":"This gem never disappoints.  Make a reservation, as it books early--and with good reason.  I've been here multiple times, and each time it produced the best food of my stay in Las Vegas.  Very good wine list, too, along with terrific service."}
{"text":"Honestly-  most delicious meal I have ever had. Period. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is that good, no matter what anyone says. 

I don't know about the best in the nation, but is the best in Vegas that I have had."}
{"text":"Service slow.  Waited forever.  Food average.  We went here instead of another place we found online (via reviews) at the recommendation of our Lynk driver.  Maybe because he takes so many people to this touristy place he thinks it's good.  We should have stuck with our plans..."}
{"text":"Every time I am in town I try to eat at a restaurant I have not been to before and this strategy has served me well. 
I was surfing FB last night and came across an article on off-the-strip places to eat in this transient town and this restaurant was on the list.  It specializes in Northern thai food with Burma, Chinese, specifically the province of Hunan influences, which is known for their spicy cooking.  I had the Northern larb.  unlike the southern version this one comes with no lime juice and it's relatively dry, but certainly flavor rich.  I had it medium hot.  It was a perfect lunch especially with a pint of beer.  They have quite a few German & American beer and they are mostly cheaper than the Thai beer lol
The service was wonderful and the decor tastefully done.  Next time I'm back I'll just focus on the northern dishes portion of the menu."}
{"text":"Another restaurant you must go to is Lotus of Siam for some delicious Thai when in Vegas. Although not my most favorite Thai restaurant of all time, certainly right up there with the best.

Service could be better, but the dining room is huge, actually there are several and the staff must be overwhelmed. The ambiance could be better, quite honestly the inside is completely unimpressive. The food is nothing short of amazing and that is why you must come here. 

The garlic prawns are memorable and delicious - cooked to perfection. Yes, they even fry up the prawn shells which seems weird, but they are edible and tasty the way they are prepared. 
We also shared the chicken satay which was very good but no the highlight here. 

The soft shell crab salad was yummy and the banana lumpia delicious (though missing ice cream).

Prices were reasonable, and we had very little wait, but the people who came shortly after weren't so lucky. My best recommendation is that if you do not have reservations, get there within 10 minutes of opening or be prepared to wait, and wait."}
{"text":"Truly a great find in Vegas.  If you want good tasty Thai food and amazing wine? ....go here! The wine list was incredible.  The prices were not really marked up at all, and some were even less than the vineyards! Wine list ranges from peju to sine qua non. 

Great spice in all the dishes, and the menu had more authentic Thai food which you would not expect from a restaurant nestled in a shopping center. Love this place. Thank goodness they are opening a place in the east coast."}
{"text":"To be fair we had been told we were going to have to wait a bit but when you end up waiting for over two hours, you are a little jaded, even once you are seated. The place itself is located in one of the most sketch areas I had been to in LV but once inside and seated most everything that we ordered was fairly on point. 

These guys don't mess around when it comes to heat and it's no wonder they have been named a top spot so many times before. The service wasn't bad and almost everything came out quickly and as requested. The tom yum was impressive and so flavorful. We tried a few curries, Thai fried rice, prawns and various other dishes. The Thai tea is a must if you are a fan. My main disappoint was not saving room for the famed mango dessert. 

Aside from the food, the only thing I would say needed to be worked on is the expected wait time. I would say if you don't have a reservation either sit at the bar or come off hours."}
{"text":"Read so many great reviews on yelp we decided to visit while visiting from Los Angeles. We were party of 3, two Asians and one Caucasian. We had reservations for dinner and were seated promptly.   We love Southeast Asian food and have been to lots of Thai, Laotian, Burmese restaurants in California and Asia.  There were about 100 other diners in the restaurant when we arrived. There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them. First, about 99% of clientele was Caucasian. This is never a good sign at an Asian restaurant. Everyone had a bottle of wine at their table. That's another oddity at an Asian restaurant.  Despite these two warning signs, we still felt we would be in for a great experience, based on yelp reviews.  We really weren't looking for ambiance, wine or decor. We were looking for \"the best Thai food in the US, as promised in these reviews.  We ordered the Northern Thai soup, which was ok but not balanced and way too heavy on fish sauce.  We had Nam Prik Onn, chili dip, which is a peasant dish popular in Northern Thailand and Burma. It usually  contains a bit of meat or fish in a very salty sauce into which vegetables are dipped.  It's eaten because meat and protein are rare and expensive in parts of thailand and Burma.  It gives a bit of taste to cheap veggie meals.  Here it was 10 bucks for a few tablespoons of something that tasted like middle america spaghetti sauce, a few vegetables to dip, and a handful of packaged chicharones (pork rinds) straight from the chips section of the local supermarket. We had Laotian style papaya salad, which was good. We also had crispy duck in chili mint sauce, deep fried fish in chili sauce, northern thai sausage.   We also had a combination dessert with coconut ice cream, sticky rice, mango, and banana wrapped in wonton wraps and deep fried.  Overall food was acceptable. Nothing was great. We had to add another dish at the end because we were still hungry at the end, portions were so small. No drinks except water. Bill came to $120 for 3 people. Add the $35 round trip cab fare from strip.  Absolutely ridiculous for mediocre Thai food. We went to a fantastic Laos / Northeastern Thai restaurant in East Oakland California a month ago and had almost the same things, with much better quality and larger portions for $39!  Of course there wasn't the huge wine selection, but who goes to a Thai restaurant for wine. That would be like going to a French restaurant for rice.
Big disappointment and way over-priced."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was a gem after all the horrible food we had in Las Vegas. We were in town for 4 days and ate here twice. We had the papaya salad (which was amazing here) and a few curries. They are truly authentic and the service is also top notch. They give you space but are really attentive to what you need. The servers are also really kind and humble, true Thai style. My bf has a gluten allergy and asked the server for a recommendation. The server basically made him a speciality dish (mint, basil and mixed veggies) and it was so tasty. This place is up to par with the Thai food I've had in L.A, if not better. 

You must try! They get pretty busy on the weekends, so make a rsvp!"}
{"text":"It's amazing.  Stick to the Northern menu.  That's what they do so well that you just won't find anywhere else.  Maybe Northern Thailand."}
{"text":"I was going to rate Lotus of Siam 4 even 4-1/2 stars but caught one of the waiters (black button earrings) leaving the toilet without washing his hands. I confronted him but he acted as if he did not understand English. The other waiters were vacuuming while customers were still eating. Brought it up to owner's attention.

The crispy chicken was very good along with the panang curry, but cannot seriously recommend after that incident. Good Luck. 

Try Kung Fu on Spring Mountain/Valley View. Great selection, tasty, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Love Thai food? Then this is the place for you! Main dishes can range from $15 to $30 but we're talking about the BEST thai food in Las Vegas. So, for sure, it's worth it. Recommendations: Crispy duck panang & drunken noodle soft shell crab. Don't worry about the \"drunken noodle\" title, it's really just Pad Kee Mao, no alcohol included! Also, be sure to make a reservation. Walk-ins can wait up to an hour for a table! It's that good. For serious.

P.S. Customer service is superb. Also ask for their recommendations. (That's how I found out about the crispy duck hehe)"}
{"text":"This place is immazing.  We came here on ftiday night with reservations and we're seated immediately.  Service was very good and every dish we had was delicious.    Strongly recommend while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food! We arrived around 6pm on a Thursday and waited about an hour and a half in the bar to be seated.

Once seated we ordered Thai tea, mee krop (a sweet and sour crunchy noodle with chicken and shrimp appetizer), crispy duck and the yellow curry with tofu. The duck was the perfect balance of crisp and melt in your mouth, flavorful and decent portion. The Thai tea was so creamy and delicious and the yellow curry had just enough kick to liven up the tofu. Very good all around. We walked out the door only dropping $50 on enough food for three people. 

If we returned, we would highly recommend making a reservation, which they take at least 48 hours in advance. Other people after us were waiting for 2+ hours."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Opens at 11:30 so there was no wait since we were a little early. Yes, it's in a sketch part of town. Yes it's in an odd old strip mall. I decided to do the buffet for lunch since I was having a breakdown committing to one dish. I'll probably not do the buffet next time, but it was a good gateway intro to Lotus."}
{"text":"I cant even begin to say how truly flavorful and fabulous this dining experience has been.. we had the chef design our eating experience along with an incredible wine pairing.  This was a food journey that has to be experienced.  I give this a 6+ star out of five. What a great family and service was spot on. Get there!!!"}
{"text":"The service is ok, but the food was worth it.  I like the fact that the food is not over priced like in most Vegas eateries.  The wine list is absolutely one of a kind, especially if you like German Reislings!

I would come back, our food was excellent, looking forward to the next trip!"}
{"text":"We have looked forward to going to Lotus of Siam for years. We finally had the forethought to make a reservation this time, so we could get in. We took our son, hoping that it would be as spectacular as everyone seemed to say it was. Sorry, but it wasn't for us at all. It's a very pretty restaurant they have now on Flamingo (I'd seen the older one, and this was definitely a step up). Our biggest complaint was the menu-- it's way, way too big and confusing. We ordered an appetizer of tempura, and it was good overall but not a lot of food for the price (and honestly, how expensive are yams and broccoli that you can't give more than one piece of each?). I apparently goofed when I ordered and got the wrong rice dish (meant to order House Special Fried Rice instead of Pineapple Rice). All it would have taken to make me happy would have been to dump a few raisins and cashews into it, but there was absolutely no offer to make it better when I questioned it-- just a lame \"I'm sorry\", and walking off. It wasn't very good at all-- rather bland. My husband got the Garlic Shrimp, and it was good (he gave me a sample), but he said it got monotonous after a bit and that the novelty of the crispy shells wore off quickly. Our son got drunken chicken, which he orders a lot at home in Portland. He wasn't impressed. I had heard of Lotus of Siam for years, but now that I've experienced it I simply \"don't get it\". I've eaten at many Thai restaurants over the years, and I simply did not care for their food or the big production it takes to just eat there. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like it. It simply wasn't worth the time, effort, and money."}
{"text":"Thai is my favorite. If I find a good Thai place, I am a loyal customer to the end. I even went to Thailand specifically to take cooking classes and had a wonderful time.

I went to Vegas for my birthday weekend and one of my best friends raved about Lotus of Siam and encouraged me to go. So I went first thing I arrived and had my first dinner there. We ordered the stuff everyone raved about for our first dinner -- and I was beyond unimpressed. In fact, I didn't like a single one of the dishes. One of the dishes everyone said was a \"must order\" (Nam Kao Tod, aka crispy rice with sausage) I thought was awful. It was too salty, the rice was not crispy at all, and there was no actual flavor to distinguish that made it taste good.

The other \"must order\" (and is the cover photo on their home page) is the Garlic Prawns. They didn't suck but anything fried is pretty good as long as it's fresh. Unfortunately, they were dimensionless in flavor and had very little prawn meat (it was mostly fried shell and was overpriced).

And lastly, because they're known for their Northern Thai dishes (which is hard to find in the US) and because I love jackfruit, we ordered the Kang Ka Joon (spicy young jack fruit curry) -- what I thought would be a curry turned out to be a tangy clear broth soup and the jackfruit was \"off\"in texture and the flavor was just ... flat.

We were beyond disappointed and the wait staff never came back to check in on us after delivering our food. We didn't want to throw the towel on the first go, so we went back on our last day to have our last meal (lunch) there. When we went back for our last lunch we decided to just stick with some classics: Pad See Ew, Green Curry Chicken, and Green Papaya Salad. We asked for the salad to be mild but it came out so flaming hot that they had to remake it for us. We asked for a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and they brought us a 10. The other two dishes were just fine. A solid B, but not something I would consider as \"the best Thai in North America.\" I love Jonathan Gold (the food writer for the LA Times) to pieces and his reviews are usually spot on, but I have to say that I would never go out of the way to go back to Lotus of Siam because I have had such good Thai all over the country (especially in Southern California and in New York City).

And I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to go there, either. But if you're in Vegas and you have your own car and you're hankering for Thai food, this might be your best/only option. Otherwise, it's not worth the hype or the wait. Just go if there's no line or wait. Fortunately, we only waited 15 minutes for our dinner and for lunch we just walked in.

I really wanted it to work out but honestly, it was just kind of meh. It's really too bad."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've been here twice and basically ordered almost the exact same thing! Now let me tell you, you HAVE to get the:

STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS!! Self explanatory.. and to die for!! MMM I am totally salivating right now haha

GARLIC PRAWNS are also one of most favorites!! They are made so you can even eat the shell!

I love noodles, so we ordered the CHICKEN PAD THAI, which is a dish i always order at thai restaurants and there's was DELCIOUS!!  I have never had a pad thai this good!! There other noodle dishes were soo yummy too! Like their fun! haha 

You could also never go wrong with CHICKEN SA-TAY in the appetizer section, but if you haaad to choose definitely go with the STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS! If you haven't got it already, i'm basically saying this place is DELICIOUS and a must try :) 

This place gets busy. We arrived like a minute before they opened and there was a line outside waiting to get eat some yummy thai restaurant. So get your butt over here, QUICK!!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place when I was out here in Vegas. OF course when I first heard of it I was excited but skeptical due to the wait time and hoping it is not just a hype place. I arrived around 545pm on a Sunday night and people were already seated enjoying their food. The hostess told me the wait time was 2 hours. oh boy, theres always tat decision to whether find something else or to wait. We decided to put our name down and the hostess told us there is a waiting room in the back. They also have the app where we enter our phone numbers and they would let us know when the table is ready. We also were able to see the wait time on the website thats linked to their app. GENUIS ! The waiting room definitely made waiting more bearable. About 3 hours later we finally got our table. We already decided on which dishes we were going to order. 

Garlic Pawns: of course were a must ! This came in about 6/8 pieces and the whole shrimp including the shrimp was edible, just make sure you chew slowly. 

Crispy Duck ( Khao Soi): I have never had this before at a thai restaurant but it was so good! Definitely need to eat this with rice. The dish was full of flavors and it all complimented well with one another. 

Tom Kah Kai:(hot pot for the bigger portion) I love Thai soup! this had coconut base to it and it was so delicious. the cream of the coconut balanced the sourness of the soup. highly recommend ordering this soup dish. 

Thai fried rice: this one was okay,  I wish I chose a more exciting fried rice. 

Thai Spagettii: We had a party of 6 so we each had to get a little bit to try. The noodles were cooked to al dente and the flavors of the sauce was gentle and not overly powered by it. 

Fried stuff chicken: this was an interesting dish. It was stuffed with mushrooms/ chicken/ and veggies. The sauce it came with was what topped off the dish. 

Nam Kao Tod: This is the duck curry.. let me tell ya ...I wish they had a bucket of the curry ! The dish came with some noodles but of course wishing they added more. The curry sauce was so good over rice. This dish was not overpowered by the curry and the duck was good perfectly so where it was soft. The curry flavor was infused in to the duck pieces. 

Had a little room for dessert so we opted for the Fried Banana with coconut ice cream. The banana was fried in what seem like the skin of an egg roll and topped with some cold creamy coconut ice cream! The temperature of the banana was perfect to add the ice cream on top. perfect crunch/ sweetness / and goodness. 

Highly recommend if you can make reservations to this place! 
BE patient during wait time because I can tell you it is WORTH IT if you love thai food."}
{"text":"This was a great move for you! the design and decor  
displays Thai culture in all its beauty .  The service was attentive and the food arrived quickly. We asked for very little we can handle and.it was perfect. Pad se ew cooked well, and not soggy or salty. Beef jerky served with their homemade spicy sauce was juicy and thick. Panang curry was creamy and fragrant due to the basil, but the sauce could be thicker and the soup could be more full of the meat and vegetables. We cant wait to.return and try different dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is a sleeper. From the outside you wouldn't think much but when you go inside the food and service are great! Very packed when I went so be sure to eat early."}
{"text":"we all agreed, among the best thai food we've had. The pad thai and duck panaang were good, we got hotness of 5 or 6/10. All of the appetizers we had were even better. very friendly staff.

heard a lot about the wait--reservations were all taken. we got there at 520p on a friday (opens at 530p daily) and were near the front of the line and got in easily. It filled up after that, but you can definitely get in. Just make sure to call a cab about 20 minutes before you need to leave, bc the strip mall is in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Hello,
I have been going to Lotus for 100 years,
Well today I order my favorite the Thai Steak Salad,
For the first time 
The Steak Salad was Horrified 
Tough lots of FAT in it 
For the price you pay very Disappointed 
I called the Manager and he wasn't Available had he answered my call and HELPED Me i wouldn't have been writing this Post,
Thanks Lotus"}
{"text":"Food is good but really expensive. Each plate is around $15-25 but it is family style. Definitely the best Thai food around and even in SoCal. Service is good. Large place for large groups. Good for lunch or dinner. Large wine selection. This is always a \"must go to\" when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good Thai food overall.  Crispy duck with curry was very good  but a little pricey.  It was crazy busy when we went, recommend getting reservations."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent Las Vegas visitor that it's my home away from home.  I can't believe that I didn't try this place long before!  I've only heard good reviews about the food from my friends who have tried it already so I was dying to try myself.

So the moment that I got to go to this place, I was ecstatic!  Unfortunately, my last visit was during lent and I have given up meat so I wasn't able to try some of the dishes that our party ordered.  But everything smelled wonderful and all the seafood and veggie dishes that I was able to eat were delicious!

I plan on going back again and again to try other dishes.  My next visit will be after lent so I can't wait to head back!

No lie, this place is legit."}
{"text":"We recently found this restaurant even though it has been around for years!  The food is amazing.  We ordered the crispy duck with the noodles.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  I love thai food, but this is the first place that was really interesting, and had more than the typical dishes.  I had a beef tartar that was SO spicy.  I asked for a solid 9/10 on the spice, and boy did it melt my face.  The server could see my tears of joy and pain, so brought a little bit of a sweet white wine to cool my mouth down.

After scooping what was left of my face off the table, I had some of my gf's dish.  It was a seafood curry thing that was amazing as well."}
{"text":"My sister, her husband, and I ate at Lotus of Siam on 1-7-2014 (for the first time) and found the food we ordered to be excellent.  I had the spicy shrimp soup and spicy chicken wings (an 8 in hotness) as an appetizer, and they were excellent.  The Lemon Grass soup with chicken her husband shared with us was excellent.  My sister ordered the Yellow Curry and was excellent (I thought is was surprisingly mild) which we all ate portions of.  We craved more chicken wings and ordered another serving of even hotter (10 this time) and were just right. My only complaint was the servers could have removed finished dishes sooner and had to be asked to do so. My sister and her husband have lived in Las Vegas over 35 years and said this was the first time that they had been by Lotus of Siam where there was not a line waiting to get in, as they had wanted to eat here before, but had not wanted to wait in line to get in.  I would say this place would set the standard for all Thai restaurants to aspire to."}
{"text":"Was not expecting to get what I did.  This place is a definition of don't judge a book by its cover.  Food was absolutely amazing and the service and staff back it all up.  I'Ike I said I didn't know what to expect as I'm no expert in this style of food but I was very impressed.  I am looking forward to returning soon so I can try some more"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is the only Thai restaurant I have tried in Las Vegas  so I cannot say that this is the best Thai restaurant in town.  But it might be hard to beat Lotus of Siam to be named the best Thai.
We went in as a group of twelve without a reservation and we followed the restaurants correct advice to arrive fifteen minutes prior to opening. To my relief we were seated all together!!
Restaurant is located in a strip mall with unassuming store front facade but once you enter, the dining room was expansive, 
We ordered three servings each of six or seven dishes. My favorite was the steak tare tare.and the papaya salad. Service was courteous and prompt.
If I go back to sin city,  I will definitely go back to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so raved about. Came with a group of 10 or so on Saturday night. Waited 45 minutes. The place is absolutely packed. I got the Pad See Ew extra spicy. It was Pad See Ew. Was it bad? No. Was it exemplary or stand out in any way? No. The prices are extraordinarily high, and you aren't paying for haute cuisine, you're paying for the ability to say that you ate here, because it's in Vegas.

If you're new to Thai food, I beg of you, check out your local mom and pop places in your hometowns. Odds are, they'll be just as good (or better), and definitely cheaper."}
{"text":"Unbelievably, Incredibly Good

I'll spare you a lengthy read.  I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.  We flew from San Francisco to Las Vegas to have lunch here.  AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!  We will do it again.

It was our second meal there - every bit as good as the first.  The location is not great, but the food is utterly amazing.  EAT HERE."}
{"text":"They were super busy and we didn't want to wait too long for dinner so we decided to order take out.  The gal at the counter was super nice and was accommodating when we made some changes to our order.  Considering we were stuck in traffic for a while, got back to our hotel and it still tasted great.  Will definitely go back to try the dine in experience."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was perfect. We had the crispy spicy chicken wings, the best Tom Kha soup I   have ever had, drunken noodles that were perfect and the best pad Thai."}
{"text":"Awful service! We waited almost two months for reservations. It took 2.5 hours to finish our meal. Waiter was mostly absent, tables around us that were seated got up and left because no wait service ever showed up - which is what we should have done. Waiter forgot he never took our dinner order and took our menus to give to another table. Forgot other orders we made. Food was good, but not worth the terrible service. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"The Lotus of Siam is hard to find as it's in a plaza that's indiscriminate and no clear signs on the street side. It was worth the scavenger hunt as the food was delicious. I ordered the Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodles, and Coconut/Sticky Rice Dessert. The Garlic Prawns were fantastically garlic ridden and crispy/crunchy. The fry was perfect and the prawn meat itself was juicy. The Drunken Noodles while small in portion, had a great flavor and \"dragon's breath\" flavor. The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewiness. Lastly, to round out my meal I had their dessert: coconut/sticky rice. The coconut flavored ice cream tasted fresh and the steaming sticky rice gave the perfect contrast to the ice cream. Overall, a great Thai food restaurant and next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will definitely be hitting this place up again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but there were some major trade-offs:

1. Our 45-60 minute wait lasted about 80 minutes. We had enough time to go back to our room, change, come back to the restaurant, and still wait long enough to be pretty hungry by the time we were seated. 

2. I got food poisoning. While we shared all of our dishes, one of them had individual soft shell crabs, which was the majority of what I puked out later in the evening. I've since read about other food poisoning reports here, particularly connected to seafood, so I think there must be a problem. It left me sick for a full 24 hours, and worse, my immune system was so down from the dehydration and the dry winter weather in Vegas, this was followed by a cold that lasted several more days. 

As terrible as my illness was, I had a very tasty dinner before the aftermath, which makes it hard to write Lotus off completely:

Red curry - amazing
Fried spicy catfish - solid
Drunken noodle soft shell crab - good noodles, bad crabs
Fried banana w/coconut ice cream and sticky rice - good but a bit too sweet
Thai iced tea - standard"}
{"text":"Crispy Duck Panang.  Had it consecutive times in Vegas.  The panang curry was so delicious, that we scoop up til the last drop.  This dish is a must every time I go here.
Tom Kha soup broth is the best tasting ever.  Too bad they use white chicken meat
Sea Bass was excellent too. Had it with drunken noodle, but it should be good with anything else.
Crispy garlic prawn was interesting and good, but a bit salty.  Must eat that with the cabbage that is served with it."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! Great cocktails, worth driving off the strip. Long wait times but you can sit in the bar area as a first come first serve option, and it was quick and great service"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a non descript strip mall off of Sahara.  We got there right when lunch service was ending but they still seated us.  Food was very good but the serving size was on the small side.  Looked like they had a really good wine selection too."}
{"text":"First off. I came on a sunday around 7, alone. There was a wait for me of 30 mins. I didnt care because i wanted thai and didnt feel like waiting for another cab and taking it back to the strip. So i sat at the bar and enjoyed a singah until my name was called.
I like to judge Thai restaurants solely based off the peanut sauce when I order chicken satay. If I want to take a whole jar home, sit in front of the tv with a spoon and eat it, I know their food will be just as good. This place isn't an exception. It was right up on my \"most favorite peanut sauce\" list (yes, I have a list of good peanut sauce restaurants, don't judge me). 
I ordered the chicken stay for an appetizer and na num tok or something...it was beef and beef makes me happy when I eat it. 
I wasn't expecting a crap load of thai basil and cilantro (which I don't care for) being on the plate when presented.  I managed to eat it and still enjoyed it with the exception of the couple cilantro bites I got. Probably wont order it again, but I will deffinetly be back here my next vegas trip. Huge menu and lots of things to try!!"}
{"text":"I was delirious from no sleep, no rest, work calling endlessly, tendonitis flaring up in my ankle and a wedgie from my thong.  Stupid underwear....why is my boss calling me again?  What time is our flight?  Fuck these shoes are cutting into my skin!!!!  I should have talked to that hot guy at the pool....too bad I looked like the Pillsbury Dough Boy.

After four days in Vegas I was plumb tired and exhausted from laughing and drinking and walking endlessly through the desert of Sin.  I was swimming in my disillusioned mind of crazy thoughts.  You know the feeling right?  The one where you are so loopy with exhaustion that you have no other emotions but \"wha????\".  You answer every question with that blank stupid grin of numbness.  

Then we came to Lotus.  The food was great and replenishing.  It was fresh and flavorful and it gave me the mental pick me up I needed to gamble once again the same $20 dollars I've been losing and winning at the penny slots all weekend."}
{"text":"Not impressed!

I'm spoiled by Thai town in Hollywood, so consider me slightly biased. The service was very absent, food was overpriced for what we got. Only thing worth mentioning is the dessert combo plate with sticky rice, mango, fried banana and ice-cream. Hit me! Hit me! with the sweets. Ok, I've been spending too much time at the Blackjack table. Again! Bad Dani!"}
{"text":"Dive of a location BUT great interior, quality food and great service-- Pelegrino water only comes in large for $7 - not bad but could be a shock if you're eating by yourself as i often do while business traveling 
Their Fuji water may come in small bottle but ask"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I come here at least once or twice. Let's just say this is the best thai place I ever ate at! The service was great and the food was so good you don't want to stop eating! Gotta try everything on the menu because I can't tell you what dish is better! Everything was good! One thing you need to know is that you need to make reservation ahead of time because there is always a long wait!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. A place like this doesn't need my review. It speaks for itself. 

The food is amazing. Well worth the wait. The issue becomes controlling your impulse and not over-ordering.

I have to believe that you really can't go wrong with anything that you order. My only advice... think outside your comfort zone. Don't order what you would get from the ma and pa thai restaurant around the corner (which I'm sure is delicious, don't get me wrong)."}
{"text":"I told a coworker of mine that my husband and I were headed to Vegas and we would be doing some touristy things the first day and would have a car. She immediately pointed me in the direction of Lotus of Siam. She said it was an amazing Thai place and that if we had a car we should definitely check it out. I followed her advice and was so happy I did! My husband, who isn't the hugest fan of Thai, and I both enjoyed the meal we had. We ordered more than we could eat (and without having a fridge in our hotel room, we couldn't take any leftovers with us) and we were both very satisfied with our choices.

I will say that I was at first very intimated by the menu. It's more than 10-pages long with a list of your standard curries, in addition to the numerous traditional dishes, plus dishes from different regions of Thailand, add to that a page or more of noodle dishes, salads, appetizers, etc.. - It is enormous! It took us a while, but we finally decided on 3 dishes we had never tried before: Spicy Shrimp Salad, Catfish red curry (without coconut milk), and a Thai-style sausage. We also ordered Pad Thai as sort of a \"control\" dish (something we're both familiar with). They have an huge (and rather impressive) wine list, but neither of us really think about pairing Thai with wine, so we stuck with beer (Singha) instead. 

First, the sausage was delicious. It was a country-style sausage, with big pieces of meat and fat in natural casing, simply seared and served with spears of fresh ginger, a few tiny (but VERY spicy) chili peppers, fresh cabbage, and toasted peanuts. Both of us were really taken by surprised at how flavorful the sausage was. There was a tart/sour almost citrus-y taste to the meat, like it had been pickled or brined before being chopped/ground and stuffed into its casing. This actually allowed the sausage to taste less dense than it was (it was a dry sausage, more meat than fat, and the citrus or whatever sour note cut through the meat). Taking a bite of the fresh ginger with a slice of sausage made for a perfect combo. This was, overall, our favorite dish.

The catfish curry was very good, although it was similar to other red curries I've tried. I had never had curry with catfish and the fish was fresh and nicely cooked (not under-cooked and certainly not overcooked). Unfortunately, the zucchini was rather mushy, even though the green beans were al dente. It had a nice heat and the flavor was there. Honestly, this was just OK compared to everything else.

The Spicy Shrimp Salad was surprisingly good and spicy. The shrimp were just this side of cooked, so still a little soft but completely cooked through, and they were huge. They were tossed with a chunky salad dressing of kaffir leaf, fish sauce, soy sauce, basil, chili peppers and probably some tamarind, plus a number of other things I couldn't quite pick out. This was all presented on a bed of roughly chopped Romaine lettuce. I could've done with smaller pieces of lettuce, as they were huge and rib-y compared to the shrimp and dressing. Ultimately, it was very good and something I would have never thought to order. I wish it was served earlier than the other dishes, more like a salad/appetizer course, rather than the last thing brought to the table.

Lastly, our \"control\" dish of the Pad Thai was a welcome comfort. It was actually the best Pad Thai I've ever had before. The balance of savory, sweet, sour, and salty was perfect. The noodles were cooked well and the add-ins of sprouts, chicken, and peppers were all nicely incorporated. There was a depth of flavor in their Pad Thai that really made the dish stand out from the rest and I really wish I had more room in my stomach to eat more of it.

The price for each of our dishes was comparable to other Thai restaurants at home. I'm surprised at the number of comments by other Yelpers about the portion size. I thought the portions were all easily shared by two people, possibly three. Believe me, neither my husband nor I starved that night! 

The service was fine, not stellar, but we certainly were not ignored or forgotten, despite being seated in the small room just off the main dining room. The decor was shabby, yes, and it definitely could use some TLC. It's at least clean. Situated in a run-down strip mall a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd., it's as opposite of The Strip as it can be, but the food, I would say, is up there on the same level with the $50/plate restaurants in the resorts. If we hadn't had other dinner plans during our trip, I would've made another stop here to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Loved this place... its off strip but worth the drive out here.

The crispy duck was awesome with tons of flavors and an awesome sauce.  The garlic shrimp was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!

The only cons I would say was the service was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get waiter to order.  But once we did get the waiter, we had pretty good service afterwards.

The portions are smaller than average but then again what they make up for portions, they gain in flavor and quality.

I would suggest ordering 2 dishes & appetizer or 3 dishes for a party of two.

It is a little more pricier than the average thai place but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant I've been too. Saw an episode of \"Parts Unknown by Anthony Bourdain\" which had me craving really good Thai food. Made a reservation for dinner time which I recommend cause as we were the first ones there outside, it started piling up with more people. Waiting 20mins outside in the blistering heat was worth it (just find shade). The food was what I expected, just amazing! Great service and the food came out really fast! 

-Got the \"Garlic prawns with the crispy skin\". By far the best thing god put on this planet it was Soooo good! 

-Got the \"khao soi with braised beef\" (the beef fell apart and was so tender)

-Got \"nam prik ong\" which was great and kinda reminded me of a thick meaty and more flavorful bolognese sauce 

-Got the \"crispy duck panang\" (amazing)

-Got the \"Sai Oua\" (thai sausage) very tasty

Overall I was very impressed and satisfied. Would eat here rather than the buffets. There's alot to choose from and the prices are worth it. I'd definitely go back here on my next trip to Vegas. I wish they delivered all the way to Toronto Canada lol"}
{"text":"-Food was as good as any other Thai Restaurant I have been to. 
-The service was terrible! 
-The location isn't ideal - make sure to park close to the restaurant. Saw some pretty interesting people looking into car windows. 

In conclusion, I personally don't think it's worth the time and money."}
{"text":"How much did I want to go here? How about reserving a dinner for 12 this week, but couldn't wait and upon landing grabbed 3 friends and went for an immediate lunch. Lunch is great, no lines!!!! The food is incredible as always, and I'm glad I made a quick stop before my big dinner."}
{"text":"New location is great! It was a big upgrade compared to the old locatio . Very busy restaurant, reserve early if you can
 We waited 1 hr on a weekday nighy. Me and my colleagues had a fun night thou! Drunken Prawns and duck Panang was great."}
{"text":"My family had tried the Lotus of Siam at their old location. The foods was good but not great. There are other Thai restaurants in town are much better then theirs and the prices was also cheaper then theirs. I happen to be in the area of their new location so I stopped by for lunch. The restaurant was busy and the girl greeted me asked if it was Okay for me to have lunch at the bar which I agreed. I had to wait for 10 minutes before the bartender acknowledged me. I placed my lunch order and it took them more then 20 minutes to bring me my food and the food was cold. I wouldn't go back there again. I"}
{"text":"First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :)

Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing. 

You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks. 

Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices... 

Just go here, that is all."}
{"text":"My wife LOVES this place.  We are only downgrading the restaurant because of it's location. It's in a \"sketchy\" neighborhood and is a little hard to find.  But, if you can make it out to the Lotus, you will enjoy it. We've been to the restaurant 3 times now, and have enjoyed every meal.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"So apparently Lotus is a legendary Thai Foodie Institution; I'm not going to review them based on that. I'm a fan of a value proposition, and this is a great one.

Make reservations because otherwise you're going to wait. Forever. Like maybe until the next day. And that's your fault because why would you not? Is your life so empty that you can afford 45-90 minutes of doing nothing for no reason?

Firstly you feel like you are heading for a mob meeting when you get here. In the strip mall this place is located in you can get all your meth/stolen goods/unregistered firearm needs met by speaking to any of the helpful men in trench coats lurking throughout the parking lot. You know something is up because despite the squalor the parking lot is filled with Lexii, BMWs and cabs from the strip. 

When you get in you notice the place is very nice for being in a strip-mall and the place is plastered with knowledgeable people in the restaurant business lavishing praise over the place. Our table featured a picture of Mario Batali looking unimpressed. I don't know that I would have put that up there.

The beer list was excellent, the two Thai beers (Chang and Singha) were excellent as well. One oddity: they have Stone Pale Ale on the menu and when ordered I was presented with a Stone India Pale Ale instead, which was not on the menu. It's a completely different beer, but yet a pretty effing good one, so no biggee.

We had eggrolls. They were small and great. Then we had curry; Panang and Red. Also great. Also a fairly UnAmerican portion. You should be able to order a Larger portion of curry, I've never ran out of a main course before. Also their version of a \"7\" in hotness is comparable to a 9 at Pin Kaow. Shit was hot yo.

Got out of there for less than a fifty with two people drinking beer. World class Thai food (Alledgedly, all I know it was spectacular). Will return. Quite happy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, off the strip in a shady strip mall, but it is worth it!! Our Lyft driver asked us how we found out about this place because he usually drives locals there. We heard from another driver that this place was worth it. He wasn't lying."}
{"text":"Turn down the what!!!! Ask for Thai spicy and you will get Thai spicy...hidden gem in Vegas and a must try for all if you want real authentic Thai food!!"}
{"text":"I only take people who are really special to the Lotus of Siam for lunch.  After all, if too many people hear about it, how am I going to get a table and get back to work on time?  Many court officials, including judges and bailiffs can be seen enjoying lunch at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Crying shrimp! Roast duck curry! Fried Banana ice cream. The #1 Thai restaurant in America has lived up to its ranking!
Excellent service, quick and thoughtful."}
{"text":"okay this place looks ghetto as hell!! I mean it is just UGLY outside. But once you step in, it's much better. The decor isn't great but the food is absolutely amazing. I tried the appetizer fried tofu and omg the sauce is heavenly! The pad thai had the perfect texture. Everything we ordered was beyond  my expectations. If you're goin to vegas, you definitely need to stop by if you're love Thai!"}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner based on the recommendation that it was one of the \"best in America.\" No way! However the food was good, missing excellence in inexcusable ways. I loved the ROASTED DUCK CURRY with its  superb blending of flavors but it had just a tiny amount of duck. The DRUNKEN NOODLE SEAFOOD missed on several counts. The dish was perfectly flavored with a wonderful blend of noodles, seafood, greens and garlic. But the noodles were clumped together in a big wad with the greens and seafood around. The shrimp, scallops, and surimi were just right and full of flavor. On the other hand the squid and the mussels were flavorless and a bit too chewy. On the plus side, I thought they got the heat just right. We ordered both dishes medium hot (5 out of 10) and thought they were perfect; no sweat on the brow but nicely intense. If I lived in Vegas, I would return because they had one of the most extensive and interesting menus I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in the US since I moved back from Asia in 2007...and I've been on a constant quest for good Thai food here. 

Don't let the location fool you...go out of your way for this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice (successfully) One time it was just ok ... nothing special ,, maybe it was what I ordered.  The second time I got something else and it was delicious.  I have gone back about three times but they are ALWAYS closed when I go.  I guess they close in the middle of the day!?!?  That is very annoying!! maybe if I get to go and they are open I'll see if I like it better"}
{"text":"Finally!!  I have been waiting and waiting to try out this thai resturant for----ever!  I''ve heard so many rave reviews about this place and this trip to vegas, i just couldn't pass it up.  I made reservations a week in advance, just to secure my table for 5!  Everything was really delicious and If i must say, a lot better than i've had in Thailand.  Their green curry is AMAZING and the best i've ever had.  Everyone at the table loved it so much we decided to order a second order!  The papaya salad with raw crab was also one of the best I've had.  My favorite is still on the street in Bangkok, but this one was almost just as amazing!  That salad packs a lot of flavor which i love because I usually have to wait overnight for all the flavors to be absorbed by the papaya, but not at lotus of siam!  That alone gets 5 stars and so does the green curry.

We also ordered nam prik noom which is a northern green chili dip that is really good with fried pork skin and plain sticky rice.  This was probably my least favorite dish, as the flavor of the green chili wasn't like the kind i've had in thailand.  it's still pretty good though!

The thai boat noodles was good, but the broth could of had more beef flavor.  If you like this dish, you should definitely hit up Yum Saap (or Saap as its called on Yelp) in West Hollywood.  Its the closest boat noodle to the kind in thailand!

The Nam kao Tod, was something I have never tried and I thought it was pretty interesting and yummy.  Some people at the table didn't like it because the sausage is sour, but its supposed to be.  If you aren't a fan of sour sausage, then maybe stay away from this dish.

The Put Prik King is also one of the best I've had.  We got ours with pork and the flavor of the prik is soooooo good!  Other thai resturants either make this dish too sweet or too salty or not much flavor.  Each bite of lOS's Put prik king is packed with flavor and is so delicious with hot fluffy jasmine rice! =)  

I wanted to so badly order everything to-go so I could enjoy it back home in LA.  

I highly highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants the best Thai food in the US. imo. haha prove me wrong!  =P"}
{"text":"One thing I really didn't like about this restaurant is that their portions are SMALL. Between four people we shared four dishes and from each dish we didn't even get the size of our hand (serving size). Another thing, our waiter didn't come around as often as we'd like. Our waters and teas were emptied out and he came around to fill them when we were done. Work on your service skills, you're in Las Vegas. Better service = bigger tips.

On the outside, this place looks like a true hole in the wall. On the inside, could use a little more remodeling/repainting. Maybe some statues. The wine cellar is pretty cool though.

We ordered papaya salad, curry, pad thai and pineapple fried rice. All delicious but I wish they gave more.

Will be returning, skeptically."}
{"text":"At the advice of a foodie and my wife's research we decided to give this a try.   We had  crispy rice appetizer and I must say it was fragrant and crunch and wonderful spicy (we chose mild).  The dish was a bit salty and the vegetables were great is perfect to offset it's saltiness - I just wish there was more vegetables to go with this dish.   I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup (I didn't specify and was quite spicy).  My wife had the Drunken Seafood Noodle (she wanted it mild) the taste of basil with the seafood is very good.  I suggest going with mild if it is your first time there.  Waiters are very attentive, friendly, and will answer any questions you may have.   Defiantly will be returning, the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Such a good place to go.  I have been to the original location and was scared when I heard about their problems with the building.  Was excited to hear that they had a new location.   

This location is really nice and the food is on par with the original.  I brought some colleagues here and they were blown away. Most of us ordered some variation of curry for dinner.  I went with my favorite Thai dish, Panang Curry with chicken.  Flavor was so good.  Not too sweet with good spice to it.  

Service was great.  We were seated quickly and sat in the bar area on the couches.  Such a good alternative to regular tables, especially after a long day at the trade show.  

This is a go to favorite when I am in town."}
{"text":"I was a walk-in during their busy lunch and I have to say they had one of the best if not THE best customer service I've ever experienced. From the hostess to all of the waiters who checked up on me, everyone was amazing. The food was the most affordable I've had in Vegas thus far, but THE BEST I've ever had here. Everything was super fresh and very very well made. The duck was extremely tender and the duck skin was very crispy. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Quality Thai Food.  This was my second visit to Lotus of Siam and the food and service is top notch.  We started with the chicken satay.  My wife had the shrimp Pad Thai and I had the Panang Curry with Chicken.  Both had really good flavor.  

Don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you.   Once you walk in, it's a whole different world.   Very nice decor and they have multiple servers so you are going to receive excellent service.  

Run, don't walk...."}
{"text":"Well, the \"American Spicy\" vs \"Thai Spicy\" convergence point has finally been met. Spiciest food (I had the pork larb @ 7) in years. Be careful here, the 1-10 scale is serious. Good traditional offerings at the back of the menu under Northern Thai. 

Service is a bit surly, they're really trying to turn tables over here quickly.

Mango sticky rice was the perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"Five stars might be a tad high, but level with me here. I live in Tucson, Arizona- the land of Sonoran hot dogs, thousands of Mexican eateries and like five very mediocre Thai restaurants and one extra crappy one. So LOS really hit the spot and somehow we managed to get a table within fifteens minutes after arriving on a Saturday night! The service was a little odd, though. We had one server who took our order and didn't come back until we paid. The rest of the time we had a busser working his tail off. We don't quite know who got the tip. Our food was delicious. We ordered green curry with beef, pad Thai with Chicken, the special mango salad with shrimp, chat broiled prawns, and sautéed veggies. The green curry wast personal favorite and it was super spicy. I'm never sure what to expect , so we went with medium and it was definitely on the high end of medium spice. My only quibble were the portion sizes. A touch on the small side but satisfying and fresh nonetheless. I ordered a Singha to drink but their wine list is certainly expansive. I'd skip most restaurants on the strip and take the short cab ride to this place. Plan ahead and try to make a reservation. We simply got lucky with out short wait time. I can't wait to come back for a bigger tasting of their menu. But this first visit was worth reviewing and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm torn because the food was good, not great and a little overrated. Everyone was nice and smiled but service was slow. The wait between our appetizer and entres was very long. We noticed that the 3 tables next to us who came after us got there food before we did. The mango sticky rice was alright ..kind of bland. The neighborhood was super sketchy. Now the question is would I go back ?  Prolly not and the big hype with Anthony Bourdain is whack!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. The wait is crazy so make RSVP. The garlic prawns is a must. Their papaya salad and pork larb are good too."}
{"text":"Believe me when I tell you that this is, without without question, the best Thai cuisine experience you will ever have. First, expect to wait. There is always a line, but on the plus side, they take reservations. And on top of that, if you just show up and the wait is an hour, they TEXT YOU and let you know when your table is ready. We ordered the Pad Thai, Nam Prik Ong, Tom Yum with shrimp and spicy catfish. All were unbelievably delicious! And the best Thai iced tea ever. The bill? Super reasonable. Staff? Attentive, polite and despite a packed house, always available. In Vegas? Go to Lotus of Siam!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It was on Bourdain & and featured all over Zagats et.al. So a group of us locals went to immerse ourselves. The service was 5 stars, but our food (we ordered a selection of Southern and Northern Thai dishes, chicken, duck & seafood etc... and it was good, but it didn't blow us away & quite frankly, we all agreed we've had better Thai food. Very aware of the Chef's northern roots, but still, I thought the food was good, just a little underwhelming. I'll definitely try them again, but I'm not in a hurry & definitely could recommend other places in Vegas above this place."}
{"text":"I hesitated between a 2 and 3 star. The food is a solid three star. Value for your dollar is a big fat 1 star. Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.

We got basically most of the popular items.
Drunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much  noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.
Crispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.
The fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. 
The spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.
We got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.
Ordered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. 

You'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.

Overall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price."}
{"text":"The ambiance was much better on the inside than out, and I must admit I was expecting a lot more food. My family and I love Thai food and we've been to a few spots already. So leaving hungry wasn't good but it was still a nice restaurant. Not a fan of feeling claustrophobic while waiting to be seated; however I will still say the food was good but I've had better. I LOVE FOOD! Looking forward to trying more Thai food places as this one didn't leave a lasting impression."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:00PM on Friday night, and we only had about a 10 minute wait.  It was strange - the restaurant is on the street, and looks almost as if it's closed and abandoned.  If you drive around to the back, you find the strip mall with the actual front of the restaurant.  The mall is strange - there are a few other restaurants and an eclectic bunch of stores and other things.

Don't let the looks of the mall get to you - the restaurant is lovely inside.  Service was great from the moment we were seated.  

We decided to get what everyone else suggested - the Garlic Prawns.  We started with the Chicken Satay, which was one of the best versions I can remember having.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the satay sauce was perfect.

We also ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp.  Once again, it was one of the best versions I can remember having.  

The Garlic Prawns came to the table, and we were a bit surprised.  We knew it was supposed to be crispy, but we didn't realize the shrimp shells were fried separately.  It was a strange-looking dish, but on our first bite of the crispy shells, we understood.  It's like shrimp chips - not those pastel colored things they call \"shrimp chips\" - but actually potato-chip-like chips made from deep frying the shrimp shells.   It was like nothing I have ever had before - and it was amazing.  The shrimp themselves were wonderfully done as well, but I am not really sure which part of the dish I enjoyed more - the shrimp or the shells.

I guess we will just have to go back again sometime to figure it out :)

We are so glad we saved an evening for this place during our vacation."}
{"text":"Driving up to this place was interesting.  It really is a divey type place.  Cabs everywhere, and all different nationalities were coming into this place, i'm assuming because it is sought out with its reviews.

The Pad Thai was pretty good.  They have a huge extensive menu, it may take you a while to figure out what you want.  

The Won Ton and Vegetable soup (Hot n sour it claimed) were nothing to write about, very bland, and they pretty much tasted the same, only difference was the won tons, but if you look at the menu they look like two different things.

No kids menus of any sort.

This is just your basic thai place, not really sure what all the hype was about.

I would give it 3 1/2 stars, I almost would bump it to four because I love there check-in technology, you can take a ride around the strip mall or walk around if you so please and get notified via text message.  You can also see where you are on there list from your phone.

The Thai Iced Tea isn't that great, it is definitely different then most, my hubby didn't drink all his, and he normally does.

I wouldn't come out of my way to come here again, it definitely didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the Las Vegas valley. Great service, great flavored, great menu selection. Started with hot and sour vegetable soup. Large chunks of veggies that were not too soggy and crisp not mushy. Great broth at a medium spicy/heat level. I had the squid garlic and hubby ordered the spicy seafood spaghetti. Both were delicious. Highly recommend. Prices were good value, not cheap, but well priced for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"All the hype - we were so excited! Truly disappointed. Each dish was no more than a 6/10 and we love Thai, so we were hoping for magic. Sadly the dishes were small, the Penang curry was bland and the noodles were mush. Funny, best thing if the night was the wine...$30 Italian, Barbera and it was liquid gold...saved the night. Won't be going back again!"}
{"text":"Great dishes, great service, great price.  It's a popular place, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"OKay, I have been here many times before and normally i owuld give LOtus a 5. I love tha thtey have made the ambience way better and explanded the place. That said, they made their food much spicier. I normally get 7s or 8s and I got the food as a 7. (Green Curry). i have never had such an unpleasant experience in my life. I started CRYING right there at the table. My mouth was literally in pain!!! I NEVER EVER send food back but we had to send it back caz it was AWFUL!!!! SOOO We did. We sent it back. Guess what they did!?!?! They took out the chilis and didnt re make anything and brought the same dish back. I couldn't eat anyway so we left and brought it home (thinkign that it would improve after my moth calmed down). JUST AS BAD at home the next day. So i called and complained to the manager. They were nice enough to offer me a free green curry on my next visit. They did that. But they were still unbelivably rude. No sincere apology or anything. Anyway, last time i go there"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here.  I've eaten here before at their first location but this was my first time at the new spot.  The inside is much bigger which is nice since there was always a wait at the old spot, but there's still a wait here.  Overall the inside felt bland.  I don't know if they're still decorating or not but it just didn't have that \"thai\" feel.  I wasn't impressed at all.

I ordered a few items for a friend and I to share and needless to say we were both disappointed.  The Thai beef jerky was decent but I've had much better at several other places.  The larb was pretty horrible.  It was so chalky from whatever seasoning they used that it was unenjoyable.  There was also hardly any cabbage and unlike every other larb I've ever had, you couldn't taste a hint of lime or freshness. 

The Pad Thai was really flavorful but I've never ordered Pad Thai and had such a small portion that it's almost impossible to share with 1 other person.  The noodles were also stuck together which essentially made it 2 bites.  As good as the flavor was, it wasn't worth the price.  

The last item we got which my friend wanted was  Nua Sao (#56).  I've never had this before but it was beyond delicious.  Essentially it's grilled steak served over cabbage with a peanut based dipping sauce.  This is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2.  It's also the only reason why I would ever order from them again.  Hopefully it's as good as the first time! Highly recommend the Nua Sao!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service and ambience were subpar. I  guess they are operating on star power. I came because I saw them on TV as one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas. I  wasn't disappointed in the food though."}
{"text":"Disaster. Wasn't busy and waited 10 minutes for the server. Had a difficult time finding the chicken in my what appeared to be a Childs portion entree. Picked over the dish till I found a a few small slices of onion and decided I'd had enough. 

Overrated and overpriced. Never going back."}
{"text":"I was very sad when the owners of Lotus of Siam left SoCal years ago for Las Vegas.   I heard that the food was excellent so visited this past weekend.  When we drove up I thought, what a dump, am I really going into this place.  Fortunately, when we entered we found it to be nice but simple and quite large, probably seating 200 people.  After a forty minute wait we were seated.  The place was packed, but our excellent waiter took time to explain things to us and was very friendly.  I have to say that the meal we had was one of the best culinary experiences I have had in my life, no kidding.  The five dishes we ordered were cooked flawlessly in the northern Thai style with wonderful seasonings and herbs.

My recommendations:
Crispy fried shrimp with shell.  Eight large shrimp, enough for the four of us.  Tasty and not oily.
Scallops with chili basil leaves.  Four large scallops cooked perfectly.  My favorite dish.  These were just wonderful.
Drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  Really tasty dish.

I wish we could have tried every dish on the menu.  I don't know how they can serve so many people and keep the quality of the food so high.  For me this is a five star establishment for sure."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better!  Considered and lives up the the view that it's the best Thai food in the country. It is amazing!  Perfect in so many ways. The food, the service are the best and the wine list for German reisling a is a wine spectator award recipient.  

We have a waiter who always orders for us and he never over does it.  But always the papaya salad and the crispy duck.  Wow. To die for. 

Don't have the traditional dishes like panang curry and pad Thai.  These are good here but there are so many other great dishes to enjoy.  Be creative and experiment!  Wonderful all around. 

Also be carful on the spice.  While they ask if you want 1-10. 5 is killer 3 is hot. The help there tell me they have a 6 but too hot for most people.  

Again not to be missed and one of the best in Vegas"}
{"text":"When a friend of mine found out I was going to Vegas, she sent me a list of places she had wanted to try while out here and didn't make it to. Lotus was on the list and after reading all the reviews here on yelp, I was convinced we had to go. So, on our last night in Vegas we headed out to dinner (we made 6pm reservations but ended up getting there early around 5:30). There was no wait at the door like I was expecting. We got our table right away. Soon after we were seated, it was like the flood gates opened and the restaurant was packed. 

Ordered:
Appetizer: fish cakes (don't remember the Thai name). These were really good. They have a slight lemon flavor, they come with cucumber pieces in some kind of sauce that was really good. We really enjoyed this app.

Meals:
Crispy duck panang: so so so good. I wish it had come with more sauce, but there was enough for all of us to enjoy. The sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was perfect. This was my favorite dish!

Garlic prawns: another delicious dish!  The skins are separated from the actual prawn so you can eat the prawn, then the skin. So tasty and crispy. I actually only ate one though bc I was obsessed with the duck dish.

Spicy sausage (from the Northern menu, forget the Thai name):  the guys I was with wanted this. I didn't like it. They liked it but said they wished it had some kind of sauce with it. 

Dessert:
Fried bananas: these were awesome. I was picturing just one giant banana coming out but it was 8 pieces individually wrapped in their wonton wrapper with coconut, then drizzled with honey. It was like a crispy banana, sort of tasted like banana bread too. Very good.

I really wish this place was closer to home for me.  It exceeded my expectations. I don't know when I will be back to Vegas, but I will be sure to come here when/if I am back. Was happy to end my trip with this as my last dinner here."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying this is the best Thai food I have ever had.
My girl and I get there and we end up having to wait about 30 minutes since it was so packed (rightfully so) we did not mind as we were enjoying watching all the different foods come out of the kitchen and enjoying the accompanying smells.

We were seated and we started with the chicken satay, which came out with a nice peanut sauce and a small cooling cucumber salad. All together, they were quite enjoyable and it is the best peanut sauce I have personally had.

We next ordered the Charbroiled prawn with tamarind sauce, which also came with fresh chili garlic and lime sauce (which was ZOMG hot since I was not expecting it and coated my prawn rather well in it). The tamarind sauce I could not make out the tamarind taste it tasted more like maple syrup, which I know they added to help sweetened the sourness of the tamarind.

We next had the Pad Thai. I have never been too much a fan of this dish, but this was very good and I would have to say the best version of it I have ever had. It is rich in flavor, nice and thick and very tasty.
We next had the Chili Mussels with a chili, garlic, Thai basil sauce over the large half shell mussels. I really liked these; they were not too spicy and had a great fresh flavor.

We finished off the meal with a mango and sticky rice dessert; it was just fresh mango slices with sticky rice on the side. The Mango was very fresh and perfectly ripe and sweet. (So Nommy Good)

My girl had a nice glass of white wine with the meal, I was surprised to see the sheer amount of wines they have here in their wine storage area.

The service was fast and friendly and we were never left wanting for a refill on our drinks or them checking to see if everything was to our liking.

I can see why Chef Saipin Chutima has such great reviews and guest pictures all over the walls here. She has a great place with great food and reasonable prices for the level of culinary expertise here. I can also see why Gourmet Magazine called it the \"single best Thai restaurant in North America.\"

I'm giving this place 5 stars and truly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I have eaten this food for years but in the interest of full disclosure I must admit that all of it was delivered by Postmates.  Postmates is convenient but the food does deteriorate in any transit.  Even though it had to drive through Las Vegas traffic before I tasted it, overall the food is always hot enough and worth the small change.  My favorite item is their Tom Kah Kai coconut lemongrass soup. They have that recipe really dialed in. My second fave is the crispy duck with chili mint leaves; I have never had a bad iteration of that dish. They also have nice fried dumplings.  There are many other items I like, in fact, almost everything I have eaten from there is worthy of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai joint in Vegas. Different location and still lived up to its hype. New go to spot for authentic Thai food"}
{"text":"Over rated. Food is good servings bot so great for the amount of money we paid for. Rather go to other Thai places screw reservations not that great of service either. Like a glorified Archies!!!  Servers at Archies way more attentive to customers. Kinda said for that kind of wait and required reservation."}
{"text":"Best meal! Crispy Duck !!! I dream about it!!! A must if your visiting!! Have tried to replicate our meal all over Maryland ... Can't compare!"}
{"text":"What a find!!
On vacation in Vegas & we always try a thai place everywhere we go. Always met with disappointment. EXCEPT HERE! IT WAS SO GOOD!!
First time we have found a restaurant that tastes VERY close to our favorite place at home.
Soups & spring rolls were wonderful, shrimp pad thai was yummy & my veggie drunken noodles were on point! 
I wish they delivered to our hotel lol"}
{"text":"Eating here makes you realize why this place is highly lauded and why there is always a wait.

I came after Christmas and the restaurant is half-opened.  The other half is sealed up with drywall, leaving very limited seating and long lines. 

At lunch #1: we ordered off the menu.  

DRUNKEN NOODLES with PRAWNS:  The prawns were fanastically fried, with the shells semi attached, which are like the best shrimp crackers ever.  They were so addictively well fried and well seasoned.  The noodles, however, were sooo meager in portion that it almost makes me angry.  I'd actually consider bartering with the chef.  I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.  The dish is littered with fried, seasoned garlicy basil leaves.  Nothing is mixed though so it's a bit of a mystery how to eat this. 

PAD THAI:  Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup! 

NAM KAO TOD: Crispy rice with sour sausage seasoned with ginger, lime.  OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.  The flavors were so intense and funky.  With a bite of raw cabbage and cucumbers in between each bite of rice, this was my favorite dish of the day. 

LUNCH #2:  Lunch buffet.  Vegetarian pad thai, some kind of curry (e.g. red, yellow), vegetable tempura, some kind of soup (e.g. egg drop, hot and sour), fresh fruit, fried rice, white steamed rice, various stir fries, orange chicken.  Only order this if you're wanting huge portions of pad thai.  I did like the banana rolls for dessert.  Banana wrapped in egg roll wrappers along with some shredded coconut and deep fried.  

Mmm, next time I'll skip the buffet and order more adventurously off the menu."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. The garlic shrimp and drunken noodles are amazing."}
{"text":"The crispy duck curry was amazing!!!!!! Enough said. The service was also on point, very attentive and super nice. Will be coming back whenever I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Lotus of HOTDAMN!! Easily hands down the best Thai food I've ever had in my life. Haven't been to Thailand yet so we'll see when I get there. But jeeeez... everything is more than reasonable and affordable. Only con about this spot is that reservations are difficult to get. And walk ins are usually a long wait. Plan ahead of your trip and make that reservation early, it's worth it. 

My top 2 are of course the crispy duck curry, it has coconut taste in it and I usually don't like coconut, but I ended up drinking the whole curry with the duck. The garlic prawn or garlic shrimp is fried to perfection. Eat the whole thing from head to toe and love it. I think I'll be coming here every Vegas trip now!"}
{"text":"There are tons of pluses and tons of minuses about this place. Lets hit the \"pluses\" first:

1. THE FOOD: Amazing! Their food is fantastic. Everything is good; I have yet to try anything \"bad\" here. The portions are decently sized, the flavour is full on. I suggest ordering things on the less spicy side of the spectrum so you can add spice to it once it's served. Got overzealous and ordered a 6 on the spicy scale. Was a little too much!

2. THE WINE LIST: Last thing I would have anticipated is a good wine list at a Thai restaurant in a strip mall in Las Vegas. BUT, this place blows it out of the water with their wine list! Definitely ask a server for pairing recommendations for your order.

3. THE PRICING: IMO, their pricing is very fair for the quality and quantity of the food that you get. Order away, good sir!

The negatives are a little bit out of the restaurants control, but still something to take into consideration:

1. LOCATION: The restaurant is located in a rather dark strip mall that is closed off from major streets. Don't be too worried, but keep your wits about you. Have been here a dozen times without incident, and haven't heard of any issues. Just looks a little...shady.

2. SPEED OF SERVICE: Sometimes the restaurant is so packed, service is a little slow...too slow for my taste. BUT the food outweighs the negative for me, so I deal with it.

3. LENGTH OF TIME TO GET SEATED: Be prepared for a wait! Sometimes you can wait here for up to an hour. Yes, it's that good.




Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely.

Would I come back here myself? Thinking about going again tonight now that I've written this review!!!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of duck but tried the crispy duck on yelp recommendations and found that and the drunken noodles were the best I've eaten anywhere. I'm always disappointed now trying the Noodles elsewhere. Not even the plain strip mall type location can detract from this being a 5 star experience. Kids loved it and I expected the bill to be much higher for the experience we had. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"Yes the hype is real! Yes, located off the strip in a strip mall next to an adult day care but who cares it's worth the visit.

-Service and decor impressive
-Food - highly recommend the crisp duck with spicy curry sauce. (Check out my pictures)

There are some troll yelpers posting incorrect information about reservations. You cannot make reservations!!!

Visit!"}
{"text":"We almost didn't try this place but I am so happy we did! Possibly because I had this thought in my head that Thai food can't be much different from the many places that we already tried back home in Hawaii...or maybe it was because my friend who introduced us to some of our favorite Thai food places back home didn't care for this place much.  I am so glad that we ended up here regardless of the reasons pointing elsewhere because I really really enjoyed it. Since they are 

LOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right. 

FOOD - GREAT - We always order the same food items when trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time. It's basically so I can compare the taste. It's also our favorite dishes. 

Egg Roll/Spring Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#30s9CUJHF-BaOe0FWkX9nQ I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling. 

Pad Thai Noodle W/Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#skkyJU6psgsiM0M_AqMO9g I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten. 

Panang Curry W/Beef - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#LhgLajbztEVV4jVr_ggEvQ We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor.  

Spice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me. 

The ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller. 

The SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book. Our server also had proper knowledge and took care of us in a timely manner. I just wish he would have been a little happier but I can't dock them just on that. 

The OVERALL price for the quality of food here is totally worth it. I enjoyed the entire experience and I have to give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I visited Harry and David at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets on 12/10/15 to purchase cookies to mail to my boyfriends grandmother and I just wanted to say that I had a very pleasant experience. The displays of the products are all over the store and there are so many items to choose from which are decorated beautifully for Christmas. I sampled tea, yogurt covered pretzels and the raspberry-filled tree-cutout shortbread cookies which were to die for.

I would also like to mention that I received wonderful service from Shanique. She was a great help in assisting me with picking out cookies for my boyfriends grandmother. She was extremely kind, patient and very informative about the products. She made the process very easy and enjoyable. She is a true asset to this company and I will always make sure she is working before I go to the store."}
{"text":"Ok so I had some suuuuper high expectations coming into this because so many coworkers and friends told me about how it was their favorite Thai place in the Western Hemisphere. I had to go! 

I went around lunch time so there was only a 10 minute wait (no reservations), which was fine. My server was a bit rude, as he didn't care to explain the spice levels. I asked him what people usually chose and he said \"i don't know. It's self explanatory. Spiciest is 10 and no spice is 1.\" Like dude I know, l o l every spice level at every place is different. I opted for 7 to be safe, but I regretted it because it was waaaay too mild. Not even spicy. Oh well.

The food itself was great. Probably one of the best pad Thai I've ever had. The tom yum soup was good, but I've had better at lower-tier, less-reviewed, Thai places. Other dishes were good but nothing amazing to note. Just a good Thai place."}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING.  Hole in the wall.  Tons of awards and recognition.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. Very fresh and a great menu selection. The wine cellar addition isn't half bad either!!! Always packed, and worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"After reading about this establishment and seeing it on \"Top Chef Masters,\" I HAD to pay a visit during my recent trip!  I was not disappointed at all.  I ordered the Red Curry (level 9 spicy) and it was like heaven in my mouth!  The menu is very extensive so deciding on what to order was no simple task. The decor is nice and service is excellent. The prices are reasonable.  

This is a definite Vegas gem.  However, those in LA don't despair.  We have places in Thai Town that are just as good--just not soooo....large in table seating."}
{"text":"i really didn't know there was going to be so many haters on this review. but honestly this is the best thai food in the US. been here twice and both times were a mind-blowing experience. 

imagine 7 guys coming to lotus and sharing 5 dishes. funniest site imaginable. we tore apart our plates man. we shared the whole fried catfish, bbq pork, bbq beef, pad see yew, duck curry, and plenty and plenty of steamed rice. honestly i didnt know that such a lowly fish, such as catfish, can be cooked in a manner that really puts it up there with the more celebrated fishes (salmon, tuna, halibut, bass, snapper, etc.). the bbq pork was crispy yet moist. the pad see yew was pad see yew. we ordered it for a stomach filler. ahah. the duck curry with little grapes and pineapples were perfect. the thing that really blew my mind was the bbq beef. little slices of beef topped off with a lime fish sauce. o man. my tongue has never tasted those flavors before. it was like i landed on another planet. this is why i gave it five stars. this restaurant changed the way i perceive thai food in america. thank you lotus of siam. o and their mangoes were out of this world."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Mediocre food, service! For a place that is jammed packed you expect a lot more!

Went there for dinner ordered the spring rolls which were mediocre at best the had the chicken penang which was ok and the had the charbroiled beef which was undercooked and very fatty. Waiter didn't ask how I wanted the beef cooked so I had two little pieces and my wife had the rest. Then the dessert had the mango sticky rice very salty ice cream tasted powdery very disappointed. Interior needs a makeover it's outdated and its not in the greatest part of town. Service was way too slow. I was eager just to leave this place.

Would not go out of my way to eat here. Don't think I would come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Thought the food was good but just a little too pricey for my taste. Lunch ran about 12 dollars for me versus 8 at Komol right up the street. Still though, a very good meal. Service was also pleasant."}
{"text":"I don't know if I can say anything that hasn't been said. So close to the strip, it's worth the uber ride just to get some crispy duck panang. Just do it. You know you want to."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Chili Dip but I ordered the wrong one instead :(. Everything was too salty for my taste. Service was very attentive. 

Nam Kao Tod - salty. need more acidy

Beef soup - very good and flavorful but a little over season 

Northern Curry - salty also. I had this curry better somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had a group of 9, so we were able to try about 14 different entrees and 6 appetizers in our 2 visits (Yes we went 2 days in a row). ALL the food was great! Definitely the best Thai I've ever had, except the chicken Larb Salad, which was only ok, as I've had better in 2 other places. A few items that stick out were, garlic prawns, drunken noodles with soft shell crab and the duck with chu-chee. I also enjoyed the mango rice for dessert. Overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars for food, 4 stars for service. Also, be sure to make reservations or you will wait up to an hour."}
{"text":"I ate here once when I was visiting Las Vegas. The food and service were great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was packed with a lot of fun people. Food was superb!  A lot of celebrities come here. Thats why it was recommended by our hotel valet. Delicious curry!  Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Don't bother to do the buffet, 11:30 in the morning, thought we would do lunch buffet here, went in, service was great, iced cold water, that is why they got 2 stars, otherwise nothing.....
Food was mediocre, went up to get food, they had just enough curry chicken and potatoes in that big ass pan for me and someone else to scoop up a touch and I mean a touch, that tasted great but so what, there was no more, why I have no idea.....that really disappointed us, I wanted to leave already....lasted it out for my in laws sake and that was it, NO MORE!!!"}
{"text":"Two highlights in my experience here: 

1) Super sketchy shopping plaza on the outside with random people biking around asking if they can wash our car rims.... somehow transformed into a very grand-looking restaurant on the inside. 

2) Super extensive menu selection... which is both good and bad. I like it because there's lots to choose from to try without overlapping with other people, but the downfall is that it takes forever to go through the selections (especially when you're trying to look on Yelp for what's good and you can't even find it in the menu).

That aside, the food was decent. I had the drunken noodles with seafood. Flavorful and nicely portioned. I wasn't amazed, but I was satisfied. If the price tag was a little less, that would more appropriate.

I think the best experience here is if you are more daring and willing to splurge on a more expensive and special dish."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I have been to. The Garlic Prawns is a must! Tried a few dishes & everything is amazing! I recommend this to all the foodies out there!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try different cultural foods. My friend recommended a Thai delicacy. It is located to the east of Flamingo Street, close to some small casinos. Business is busy, my friend made an reservation for us ,usually wait for two hours, we ordered a dish, salad beef, crispy curry shrimp, curry duck, etc ... taste very good service Warm and thoughtful, my friend is very satisfied after dinner"}
{"text":"I was heading back to LA from Vegas and I was looking for a $$ restaurant and it was the best choice! 

We ordered four dishes: Duck Penang, Chicken Sate, Pad Thai, and Pad See Ew. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS. but my favorite would be Duck Penang. I definitely want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Oh boy where to start with this place.

Me and a friend decided to look for a Thai place in Vegas after a weekend of camping/climbing at Red Rocks. This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.

This place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.

We started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like \"Oh you eat just like Thai style!\" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. 

Then we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.

I can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.

The only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time..."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam, often referred to as the best Thai restaurant in America, has by now garnered a ton of accolades and press. Still, it sits in an easily overlooked and unassuming strip mall away from The Strip. The walls are adorned with famous celebrities as former patrons. There's still a wait, although much of that may be to create the illusion of a packed dining room (it's not). We waited about an hour for a table for six, although the table had been empty the entire time. 

The menu itself is huge and includes dishes from Northern Thailand not found in your average Thai restaurant. Based on prior reviews, we ordered the nam kao tod and the sea bass drunken noodles. We added on some typical Thai plates such as pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and the spicy garlic chicken wings. The nam kao tod beef was good, but inconsistent. Some of the pieces were perfect, while others were more tough and dry. The must-try dish of the night was the sea bass. The fish was perfectly fried, but the drunken noodles left much to be desired. The pineapple fried rice was and pad see ew were average. 

We finished with a mango sticky rice for dessert, which was amazing. The mangos were as sweet as can be and the sticky rice was topped with just the right amount of lavender to give it a floral aroma with every bite. Overall, the sea bass was a bit pricey and the other dishes were okay, but it was a good meal, albeit pricey for Thai. I have to return to try the garlic prawns. Come with a group of friends (but come early) so you can try as many of the 150 dishes as possible."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a Fantasy Football tournament and I wanted to try a nationally renowned eatery known as Lotus of Siam. It had so many great reviews and accolades that I felt we couldn't lose. But similar to my Blackjack experiences, the house won. I frankly was underwhelmed. I am a Thai food aficionado and have experienced some amazing Thai cuisine in Atlanta and Houston. I was betting that Vegas would blow them all out of the water; er desert, but that didn't happen. The group I brought with me were somewhat new to Thai food so they were blown away with how good it was. 
The service was 5 stars and the wine list lived up to their wall full of Wine Spectator awards. 
The Tom Kha Kai soup was nothing special. The stuffed chicken wings left me yawning and the Pad Thai was decent but didn't move me to tears.
I have heard that it can be very difficult to get reservations here but we had no problem Sunday night.
I really don't feel this place is that special or worth the 15 minute cab ride from the strip."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Polite and gave good recommendations.

Food listed in order of preference:
Crispy shrimp
Sea bass
Duck with Penang curry
Crab fried rice
Chinese broccoli 
Pad seew"}
{"text":"Finally made it out here on our second visit to Vegas, and we were not disappointed! We got the highly recommended Garlic Prawns and Crispy Duck Panang, and it was perfect for 2! The prawns were so good you can eat the fried shells as well, and the duck panang was so rich and delicious I didn't want to leave any of it behind. Will go again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Although an elderly gent at the next table was literally having a heart attack while we were eating, I'm not going to blame it on the restaurant. The place is on another level in terms of Thai restaurants. A huge menu like Srirapathai in Queens but with some amazing specials. The ultimate yummy was a short rib penang that had to be the best Thai dish that I've ever eaten anywhere including Bangkok. the seafood is also good considering your in landlocked Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the restaurant but my first review.  If I would have reviewed it my first time, I would have given it 4 stars.  However, the second time around, it was just OK.  Yes,  it is better than your typical average Thai restaurant.  However, for me, it's all about the quality/price ratio.  We ordered the garlic prawns and the crispy duck over drunken noodle.  The prawns were good but not as crispy as I remembered the first time.  The duck was good, but the amount of the duck and noodles that you get is small compared to the cost.  I don't think I will go back to it since there are so many good restaurants to try in Vegas."}
{"text":"First of all, the hostess was super rude. We made a reservation for 5:30 and wanted to push it back to 6, but they were not flexible. They even said they couldn't guarantee our table if we were 15 minutes late. We got there and ordered the chilean pad kee mao, beef panang curry, fried shrimp, and a Tom Kan Kai soup. The shrimp was way too salty. The beef was overcooked in the curry. The papaya salad was way too spicy. Having had better Thai food before and also have cooked my own Thai food, this place was overrated. The yelp reviews were deceiving. For a Thai restaurant, this place is very overpriced. Thai food is normally not that expensive."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is heaven! Not only is the service superb, but the wine list and menu are to die for. Must try the nam kao tod, tom kha soup, and pad thai! I used to hate thai food until I came to this restaurant, and now I cannot get enough."}
{"text":"If you're going to venture off the strip for a single meal, make it this place. It's located in a seedy strip mall a mile or so from Fremont Street, but food-wise, competes with the best restaurants in Vegas. While everything we ate was delicious, the Tom Kah Kai soup, the Nam-Prik-Ong dish (spicy goodness with pork rinds) were the most memorable, and the Singha's washed down the Thai perfectly."}
{"text":"Every time I come out to Vegas I stop by this delicious hidden gem! 

These items are my go to's:
Nam prik ong (spicy pork dip with an assortment of veggies on the side) 5/5
Garlic prawns!!! 5/5 (you have to try these before you die) 
Koong sarong (bacon wrapped shrimp in a wonton wrapper and fried) 4/5
Mee krob rad na (crispy noodles topped with gravy mmmm) 5/5
Nam kao tod (crispy rice mixed with cubed pork and a bunch of herbs and spices, really flavorful...I would skip the cubed pork sausage tho it reminds me of spam) 5/5 
Chilean sea bass with ginger 5/5
Khao soi braised short rib 5/5 (one of my faves!)"}
{"text":"Incredibly good. A group of 5 of us ate family style and really enjoyed the food here.

I'll try to come back every time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food in North America! The owner head chef lady is amazing and is on her staff! Been eating here for over eight years and have seen the restaurant evolve but food stay amazing. Skip the Buffett but order everything else! Wine is amazing also"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing.  Don't let the shady location fool ya.  The service and food are second to none.  Be sure to make reservations well in advance because this place gets booked pretty fast.  The drunken noodles and grilled prawns are the best."}
{"text":"Highly overrated and overpriced. Not a bad place, but I honestly think people say it's good just because other people say it's good. The prices were a dollar more expensive than people claim in Yelp, so they appear to keep hiking up the prices. People continue to line up and pay it, so I don't blame the restaurant for meeting market demand - I just don't understand it.

1) Garlic prawns.
Everyone says to get it, and the pictures look great. I ordered this, and the wrong thing came out. Turns out, there are two kinds and you need to clearly specify which one. The one in all the Yelp photos is the deep-fried version. Otherwise they give you the BBQ/grilled version. The grilled version is not bad, but wish I knew. $26 is a lot for the wrong dish.

2) Khao Soi.
It's okay. I like how the noodles are fairly soft, but nothing special. 

3) Drunken seafood noodles.
This one was terrible. Normally I love wide, pan-fried rice noodle dishes, but this one came as a giant messy wet mush of dough as the noodles got soggy and fused together. I picked at the seafood and veggies and left all the noodles, which should've been slightly crispy on the pan-fried side and normally the best part of the dish.

I want to note that the staff seemed friendly. I just don't get the customer ratings; the same food or better is readily available at every other Thai restaurant for about $6.95 a dish."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my whole family when we visited Vegas and had started craving good Thai food because of all the hype that I read here at Yelp and I gotta say, I really don't find it any special or different from the other typical Thai Restaurant I have been to. For starters, we actually had to wait at least 45 minutes to get a table. And then we had to wait another 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to actually give us some attention. The food was just ok but like I said, nothing really special."}
{"text":"So absolutely amazing!!! So cool and the food was worth waiting for. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation otherwise you'll be waiting for an hour to two and a half hours. It was so cool the head chef/owner came to say hi and told us that our daughter was the most beautiful baby ever. Order off the back of the menu, Northern Cuisine. Best Asian food anyone has ever had ever!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior! We were a little skeptical based on the location being in a run down strip mall and it doesn't look like much from the outside. When you get inside, you realize it's huge and full of people! The food was awesome, the menu is extensive, and there are options you don't see in every Thai restaurant. If I lived in Vegas I'd be a regular! It's worth the drive if you love Thai food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! 

We went here for a pre-wedding dinner the night before. We love Thai and wanted to compare to our local favorite. 

I liked the Tom Kha Gai. The hint of lime was refreshing. 

We also tried several others dishes. We asked for medium spicy but I felt like it wasn't that spicy. However, it was still best Thai food (aside from our usual local favorite) we've tried! We'll definitely come back!

One small note, come when your not rushed for time. Our waiter and food took a little bit longer than we're used to, but it wasn't a problem."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by saying that my husband is Laotian and his mother and aunts are excellent cooks, and we go out of our way for good Thai, Lao, or Vietnamese food.  We were excited to try this restaurant after seeing it on the travel channel.  After weeks of trying to get a reservation we decided to go straight there when we were driving in from San Diego for the weekend to snag a walk in table.  Our friends were on the strip and on their way to meet us there so we asked for a table for ten and were seating with the understanding that we would start ordering (at the requests of the hosts) since the rest of our party hadn't arrived yet.  We ordered and were waiting for our food and our friends but I could see the manager giving us the eyeball as the rest of our party hadn't arrived yet.  I told my husband that the manager was going to ask us to leave and sure enough he sent the hostess over to tell us that we needed to order or leave (we had already ordered appetizers for the table).  We let her know that we had already ordered and we were left in peace (nice hostess but I was extremely displeased by the actions of the manager).  In addition, when they asked if they could have one of our tables back so that they could seat others, we said no problem because three of our party were children.  The food - average.  We can get equal or better food at the Thai restaurants in San Diego and Los Angeles for half the price.  I will say the crispy duck was excellent but very rich.  And the jaew mak pet was spot on for flavor (we make this at home).  No complaints from our party besides our treatment by the manager, and a general comment that there are more decently priced Thai restaurants with food equally as good.  Note:  we don't have a problem spending for good food, and my husband wants me too add that the food overall was too sweet, and he likes sweet."}
{"text":"This was simply the best Thai restaurant I've had thus far.  Many have said this was the Best Thai in the continental USA and I think they're right!  I was in Vegas for a week and we visited this place 3 times.  Loved it.

All my favorite dishes were found under the Chef Choices section of their menu.  My top favorite dish was the deep-fried prawns with shell with pepper in special garlic sauce.  We tried both versions of the deep-fried prawns but garlic was hands-down easily the best (the other was just okay).  

We also ordered a Whole 2-pound CharGrilled Catfish in our 2nd visit.  It was yummy but we agreed we wouldn't order this version again.  First, it takes 45 mins. to prepare (which we were told, of course).  Second, the catfish skin was a bit too well-done (burnt) for our tastes (and we like BBQ).  The cooked catfish meat was very good and it was worth trying.  We'll probably try another cooked version of  whole catfish next time we're here, visiting Vegas.

I also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference].  

The Chilean Sea Bass was also excellent but I've had equally good sea bass for less in price.  Not a super value dish but the quality was excellent.  The crab fried rice was also excellent.   We had crispy duck w/ drunken noodle and it was good, not spectacular (since being asian, I've had quite a lot of duck).  

Choose the spice level of your food to suit your preference.  I don't tend to go too spicy and since I have a fairly low spicy tolerance level, we usually choose Level 2.  We tried Level 4 and it was too hot for me halfway into the second serving.  For those who like it spicy, just ignore my warning and go for whatever rocks your socks!  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good place for groups! We went there for my sisters birthday with 6 adults and two babies. Huge menu, friendly and accommodating waiters,"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have yet to have a bad experience at this place. Gets super busy at lunch call ahead is my only suggestion."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time on Thursday didn't have to wait at all.  Ordered vegetarian pad Thai & had a banana wrapped that looked like it was deep friend in egg roll paper, sprinkled with powder sugar (forgot the name) but was delicious with their yummy Thai ice coffee. Our waiter was very nice & helpful too."}
{"text":"This place is seriously legit.

It's rare when I have high expectations going in and they're exceeded but that's exactly what happened at Lotus of Siam. It came with a lot of hype and I left super impressed.

We ordered most of the signature dishes:

Crispy duck in panang curry and egg noodles
Garlic prawns
Steamed sea bass with spicy sauce
Pad seew

Everything was so full of flavor and eye opening. I can't wait to go back.

Service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the Tom Kah Kai soup and both the Beef Jerky (under appetizers) and the Charbroiled Chili Lime Prawns (BBQ) were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Asian cuisine.... Heck I love food in general! LoS was introduced to me from a Vegas native. It is off the strip in a more residential commercial area. There is definitely a wait during dinner time enough the restaurant is huge! 

I enjoyed every single dish! Even the waiter agreed that all my dishes are great choices (maybe he says this to all his guests). 

1. Roasted Duck Curry- Yanno the Peking duck that is roasted in a lot of Chinese restaurants? Yeah! That one. BUT Crispier. Smother some red curry over it. BAM

2. Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp- Ya can't go wrong with lemony-spicy soup!

3. Drunken Noodles with some kind of fish (Sea Bass??) I am not sure, but the fish was soft, the noddles were extra carby, and the sauce is nice and savory.

4. Thai Iced Tea- Duh!

5. Fried Garlic Shrimp- Crispy, Garlic-y, Great dipped in that curry sauce!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the country.
Do yourself a favor and get the Braised Beef Khao Soi. The meat is tender and the sauce is bursting with flavor. 
The best advise, after you order an appetizer of chicken Dumplings or Prawns, is to turn to the back of the menu. Be sure to order from the Northern section or the chef specials.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So the new location is not the same as before.  Food was very poor quality and obviously not cooked by a Thai chef.  Crowded loud dining room.  My noodles came luke warm and soggy.  Wife's dish came without rice as at other place.  Salad did not have spices just papaya.  Soup for 2 expensive and bland.  Not the same...  Very lame."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and was told it was the best. Not the best but still good. Had the Tempura, beef pad thai, Nam kao tod, and spicy basil beef. Loved the tempura and the Nam kao tod. They have a great selection of wine and Saki. You must make reservations because this place was packed from the time we walked in till we left and I mean tons of people waiting! Prices were good, service ehhh could have been better. We had to call our waiter more than a few times and they kind of try to get you in and out. This was for dinner time! It wasn't what I though it was going to be. Don't go expecting what you see in the magazines!"}
{"text":"One of my must visit places in Vegas for Thai food.

My favorite dish:  Thai Beef Jerky.  Yum Yum Yum!  (5 Stars just for this!)  Most of the thai restaurants I've tried do not make it the way Lotus does.

+ 1 STAR for the selection of German Riesling (white wines).  Try their 3 glass tasting sampler!  Awesome!

---

UPDATE 10/01/07:  I came to Lotus for Lunch with Jim C. and my wife, as they are here for a work related conference and I was just here for the food!  I had the $8.99 lunch buffet and boy was this disappointing.  If I had never eaten anything a la carte from Lotus of Siam, I would NEVER have returned based on the food quality and taste of the items in the buffet.  The Thai Red Curry Chicken was too watery and had no flavor except for being spicy.  The Pad Thai was boring, too sweet and lacked limes and peanuts.  The only star in the buffet bunch was the Beef Noodle soup. 

Please don't judge Lotus of Siam based on their buffet.  Order from the MENU!!!"}
{"text":"It's been, oh 5 years since I've step foot in Lotus of Siam. I had the lunch buffet and remember not being super impressed. So when my boss said we were going to Lotus of Siam for dinner, I was a bit confused. He said the food was amazing, and it turned out he was right. Unfortunately, the service was pretty terrible, so I won't be running back.

We had a \"reservation\" yet had to wait 10-15 minutes to get our table. With it being 110 degrees outside, that sucked. Once seated, it was another 20 minutes before we could order, and only because we pretty much tackled an employee to take our order. The ordering process was very rude, as we seemed rushed and weren't helped by any recommendations as we had asked for.

We were brought three different plates that weren't ours. We had ordered so much food we didn't know what was ours and what wasn't, and the staff kind of scolded us for beginning to eat a plate that was set on our table. Get your act together, guys!

As I said, the food was all pretty amazing. That's the only thing saving this from being a 2* review. Everything they put in front of us was delicious. I really don't remember a bad dish.

When all was said and done, we were left with a $50 per person bill, which seemed like a lot for the style of restaurant we were in."}
{"text":"Wow, it's been awhile since we visited this restaurant.  But, we hadn't forgotten about it.  We always thinks about the Garlic Prawns (Chef's Choice).  Since this was an impromptu trip we didn't have a set plan for anything special, except to have Garlic Prawns.

When we reached our hotel we immediately called the restaurant only to find out they are completely booked this evening and tomorrow evening as well. They said it could be up to an hour or more wait.  We decided to chance it since we wanted our guests to try the Prawns. My husband went into the restaurant and place our names on the waiting list.  we decided to cruise the strip thinking we had at least 45 minutes, well, within 20-25 min we got a call saying they are ready for us.  I was thankful we didn't drive further into the strip , we may have lost our spot if we didn't return on time!

To not make this any longer, we got our prawns and we were pleased just like the first time.  Our guests enjoyed it just as much.  We enjoyed the Peking duck curry, yellow curry, nam sod, and fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  Everything was excellent, including the customer service.  

Oh, how I long to return already!"}
{"text":"Great food and wine and excellent service. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Not that this place needs my review, but I'm surprised I've never written one considering the number of times I've come. It's almost a tradition to come here for Thanksgiving day dinner.
Always make reservations. Always.
If you've heard of the dish in Utah, don't order it. It will just be something you've had before, but better. Order things that are Northern Thai specialities we don't see here. The best thing to do is put yourself into your server's hands. Tell him you want shellfish, or garlic, or duck, or ... Let him know the kind of spice level you tolerate. Then let him recommend dishes. I've never had a dish I didn't like the server recommended. Also, always get the Garlic Prawns. That's just a given. Also get the recommended fish dish. The sea bass they always have is a good starting point, if the server doesn't have anything better."}
{"text":"The restaurant is off the strip, which is the first and very important point.  The wait for a table on a Tuesday night at 7 pm was 1.5 hours!! It meant something.  We were able to get 2 seats at the bar immediately which were very comfortable to sit at.  Once the bartender was able to pay attention to us, we were given the very big menu. Lots of choices!!
The appetizers varied tremendously, so we chose deep fried chicken dumplings and the fish cakes. Both excellent. 
For main course, again A LOT of choices. We had crispy duck in panang, which was one of the best Thai sauces I have ever had. Another dish was deep fried soft shell crab over drunken noodles. It was spectacular!! The crab and the duck stayed crisp throughout the epicurean adventure. 
We were too full to try some of their deserts, which wasn't many, but the standards usually seen at such a restaurant. 
We Will Return for more of this amazing cuisine!!"}
{"text":"Come before they open they said. If you don't, you'll have to wait for two hours they said. My curiosity was peaked. What can make this place so good that people are willing to wait?

The restaurant has a small entry way where you check in and I was dreading being cramped in such a tight space for TWO hours. Luckily, they do have a large banquet style waiting room behind the bar area. Phew. We were quoted two hours but we waited closer to 3 hours. I was doing my best to control the hangry monster within. 

TWO MUST HAVES: Crispy Duck Khao Soi ($26.95) and Garlic Prawns ($27.95). Oh my lordy. The recommendations were on point. I favored the garlic prawns slightly more. Fried to perfection. You could eat the entire prawn -- even the tail! I came close to tossing them, but so glad my friend caught me before I did. Close call. Trust me, you'll want to savor every bite. And the duck... It's packed with flavor. My boyfriend's favorite dish. You must get them both. 

RECOMMENDATIONS...

Nam Kao Tod ($8.95): This was a crispy rice dish appetizer. It sounds plain, but don't be fooled. Every bite you'll get the taste of lime, chili, cilantro, seasoning, and the texture of rice that's crispy yet chewy. How they do it I do not know. Fry masters are working in the kitchen.

Thai Spaghetti ($11.95): It's the sauce and noodles that will win you over. It had that slightly sweet flavor, similar to pad thai. The noodles were served al dente, which was perfect. It had that chew texture that I absolutely love for noodles. 

Banana Roll ($8.50): Highly recommended with coconut ice cream (additional $4). I'm not the biggest coconut fan, but loved their ice cream. I need to know where they get it! The banana roll portion was generous even for a party of 6 like ours. Banana lovers will not be disappointed. 

We got a few other dishes, including their Thai Fried Rice with Chicken ($10.95), Tom Kah Kai Hot Pot Soup ($14.95), and Stuffed Chicken Wings ($11.95). They were all good, but the dishes I mentioned above were noteworthy! 

Stopping at Lotus of Siam will truly be a treat for your tastebuds. Food is AMAZING. It has officially made it to my #1 spot for Thai food. Service was fast and efficient from the moment you're sat. Prices are steep, but they really know how to cook up amazing food. Best way to go about it is family style so you can sample a little of everything. 

Reservations are taken but should be made AT LEAST a week in advance. A couple in front of us had reservations and got seated immediately. Note taken. The wait was worth it, but I can't see myself doing it again. BE SMART AND MAKE A RESERVATION!!"}
{"text":"I still think Lotus' poached salmon is among the best I've ever had, and I'm still a huge fan of their drunken noodles and roast duck curry. But I've decided to update and dock another star because their service has consistently gotten worse and worse over the years, and the reality is there are far more quality Thai options in the Vegas valley now than there were even just a few years ago - including (or is that especially) those opened by past Lotus employees. 

My most recent negative service interaction involved our waiter losing one of our leftovers that we'd asked to get boxed up (we had three leftover dishes, and the waiter only gave us two back in boxes). I was particularly annoyed because I had only ordered that dish intending to take most of it home - we'd barely touched it. A different waiter came by, apologized, and told us that they would cook up a completely new dish for us to take. Honestly, at that point I'd have preferred if they'd just knocked it off the bill, but I decided to accept their offer and wait for the new dish.

But when we got home, we found out that the \"completely new dish\" was barely a 1/4 portion of the original. I don't even know if they cooked a new dish at all or what - maybe they even just gave us someone else's leftovers that they were going to throw away. In any case, it just left a really bad taste in our mouths. If you're going to try to make up for your service failure, you'd better do it right, or you're just making it even worse.

Ultimately it's becoming tough to justify the trip to Lotus, and honestly even 3* might be generous - the service has really gotten that bad. Sure, there was a time when Lotus was the standout Thai option in Las Vegas, but it's certainly not the case anymore and I get the feeling that Lotus manages to stay busy only because they're riding on their past fame."}
{"text":"I always heard about this place while in Vegas, but never ventured far enough off strip until recently to try it. 

The place is small and in a strip mall. The road to get there is slightly confusing and it feels like you're in a factory. The inside is quite nice but small, luckily there was no line.

We ordered a curry and a noodles dish. Serving sizes are smaller than we are used to compared to our normal Thai place in Los Angeles. Food was good, but not worth the \"hype\". In comparison, we still prefer our normal place in Los Angeles - Original Hoy Ka Noodles (see review).

Worth trying for the hype, and the northern dishes. Slightly more pricey."}
{"text":"As far as Thai fair goes, this place definitely does the job. The food was in no way exceptional, but it was very satisfying in a way that one would expect from any decent Thai joint.
The Panang Curry was very tasty and cleared my sinuses nicely.
What stood out to me most was the setting; situated in a derelict strip mall near DTLV, it seems like everyone who is occupying the very crowded dining room is in on a little local secret. 
Oh yeah, and the price is right. $50 for an appetizer, two entrees and two beers."}
{"text":"Pretty Surprising.  Neat spot that is in an old shopping center, in a not perfect part of town.

Once you get over the lack of ambience outside, you go in and the restaurant is awesome.  Packed with people, clean, busy - and food is pretty ridiculous.

Everything I had ordered was recommended by the server and it made me happy I wasn't on the Strip, paying an arm and a leg for food this good.

Fresh ingredients and vibrant colored and tasting dishes - enough talking - get yourself over there.  :)"}
{"text":"So surprised with many 5 star reviews for this restaurant. Probably we come from California where has a lot of good Thai restaurants so this place did not get our expectation. We had to wait 1-1.5 hours to be seated. Their tom yum hotpot was tasty, however, the papaya salad was pretty bland. The noodle with seafood definitely made us so disappointed (not fresh seafood). Services were friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Very Good food, lots of flavor and service was fairly quick.  This place is busy for a reason."}
{"text":"Authentic northern Thai cuisine with lots of flavor and dishes that you don't see in typical Thai restaurants. The have great selection of wines and sake. The service was excellent. My favorite dish was drunken noodles with soft shell crab and mixed fried rice. My favorite dessert was sticky rice with mango."}
{"text":"+ for the win in a very Las Vegas 50% abandoned, 100% ratchet AF strip mall. Mad Tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my.  This Thai food lover is still in awe of last nights dinner.  Wonton soup was wonderfully light and full of rich flavorrs.  Hot sour vegetable soup was a fantastic contrast of flavor.  The garlic grilled prawns with chile and lime were delicious.   Chicken red curry had a grrat flavor.   The garlid fried prawns had their shell on - a great comination of texture and garlicky goodness.  Ordered off menu for sauteed vegetables in a spicy chile garlic sauce - off the hook flavor.  Service was great as always."}
{"text":"Having lived in Vegas for a few years, I've been to a lot of restaurants in town from hole in the wall to upscale places and everything in between but Lotus of Siam is one of my favorites.  They renovated the interior a few years ago so it's nicer and more spacious than it used to be.  They have also added an extensive wine selection.  

I usually order the same thing (pad thai, tom yum soup, yellow curry) at Thai restaurants but at this restaurant, I also order different seafood dishes and they have all been amazing.  I recommend the garlic prawns or garlic squid for seafood lovers.  It's best to call ahead for a reservation, especially on the weekends.  I recently tried to dine on a weekday night but they no longer had space for reservations so I went the next day for lunch instead."}
{"text":"Don't see what's the big deal . Very simple place , super packed , 2 h waiting for just average quality food . Oh and you will be served so fast you lol be done in 10 min ... And you will be put under pressure to leave coz next person waiting ."}
{"text":"My impression of Las Vegas is that it is super lacking in edible Thai food and edible sushi. But I guess I come from California so maybe ...y'know...perspective.

I waited like, 2 hours for dinner on a Friday night. Yelp is crazy for this place. My friends are crazy for this place. My DENTIST is crazy for this place. So I thought the 2 hour wait must mean that it's okay to join the craziness.

But it's really just mediocre Thai food dressed up nicely in a terrible restaurant setting. Really, the atmosphere is kindof like a typical Chinese restaurant - sub-par service, dirty tablecloths, wobbly tables, a little noisy so you-can-but-not-really-hear-each-other-talk, etc.

Maybe the trick is that they sell wine, which is nice. So people eating here get drunk enough they can't remember they just spent like $30 on 6 pieces of tiny shrimp. Seriously, Vegas grocery stores have the biggest shrimp for so cheap. I'm not sure where this place is sourcing their ingredients from unless they're just sitting on like, 80% profit margins. Everybody recommends the Garlic Prawn dish. The taste is *fine* but I think that's a rip off if I ever saw one.

Also got the duck panang. It was good...it's just...I mean, you're paying $30 for such a small dish. 

Is it me? Am I just a pig who eats more than she should? Because I just don't understand how these are good deals for people living in Vegas???? Or are they single-people portions and I'm misunderstanding because the setting is so...common? Honestly, when I pay $30 at a restaurant for a single dish, I either expect it to be super large OR super extraordinary OR at least have a super comfortable atmosphere. And the dishes here are literally none of the above. So, I don't know. I guess I'll just keep searching for a good Thai place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very flavorful, and incredibly helpful service who advised against some items we were getting that had a similar sauce and then recomended something else that was amazing. And the price is so reasonable! Definitely worth the cab ride off of the stip."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam..oh how I was so excited to visit you again..and oh how you have let me down.  But eventually I will give you one more chance....

Lotus is sort of an upscale Thai restaurant. Service is great, but they still have paper napkins and paper place mats.

We order Garlic Prawns, Nam Prik (mild), Northern Thai Larb, and Tom Yum.

Tom Yum...they should name this Tom Yummy soup.  You can really taste the lemongrass in this.  But soooo spicey.

We wanted to try the Northern Thai dishes because they are not as common...I think I know why...just not as good.   

Larb seems like it's stir fried. Seems almost Chinese. You can definitely taste the spices and herbs. But has none of the tang like its southern counterpart.  The menu does say no lime, but I was surprised at how much I missed the lime!

Nam Prik mild version is really what the menu describes...like spaghetti sauce with vegetables to dip.    It's that simple to describe...i was so excited to try this.  My fault for not going for the medium spicey version.

Garlic Prawns...this was the disappointment of the night.  I've had this dish before and it was amazing.  As we walked into the restaurant almost every other table had a plate of it.  Not sure how everyone else like it, but I thought it was very average.  It had too much batter and not enough flavoring. I don't know if it was because so many people ordered it and they just got sloppy, but definitely not as good as what I remembered it. For $28 a big disappointment.

Overall I will give it one more try...but since it's so expensive...one more try is all you get lotus.

Oh, forgot to mention...not sure why but everything came at once..soup and the dishes...."}
{"text":"Highly recommeded!! Line can be very long, recommend making reservation. The food and service are very good. Garlic prawns and crispy duck penang are must try. We have great experience when we were there and we always visit whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know if maybe there just aren't many thai places in or around vegas, but I was a little disappointed with my experience here after reading all the hype. Monday of labor day weekend at 7pm had a 20 minute wait, which isnt bad at all and the service was great but the food was only just okay- not great. The tom yum soup was tasty and had generous portions of prawns but it came out luke-warm. The northern larb wasn't tangy enough for me, but that was probably our fault for ordering the northern version instead of the usual one. The drunken noodles weren't very empressive, the noodles felt chunky and were clumped together so much so that I basically just speared a chunk with my fork and bit it piece by piece. The papaya salad was good and comparable to some of the good thai restaurants I've been to in NorCal. My favorite dish was probably the curry (can't remember exactly which one we ordered, sorry), it was creamy and oh so flavorful. The prices are in line with most all thai restaurants, but the portions are a little on the smaller end. If you're in Vegas and you really need some Thai food, Lotus of Siam will do the trick but if you've got a taste for solid Thai food this place won't blow your mind."}
{"text":"If you find a better Thai restaurant, you must be in Bangkok. This place is the best. Lunch is busy but you can usually get a seat. Forget the buffet...that's for rookies. Order off the menu. You can close your eyes and pick something...you will like it, believe me. The staff will help you (they'll probably tell you not to order jackfruit) and they will ask you how hot you like it, on a scale of 1-10. I eat fresh jalapenos so I usually go to 7-8 and that's plenty hot. 
Try the northern Thai dishes, especially the curries. The wine list is surprisingly good. And yes, it IS in a dumpy strip mall behind everything else. Don't let that fool you. Get there early for dinner; it WILL be packed."}
{"text":"Widely viewed as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country.  From everything I've read the key is to order off of the Northern Thai section of the menu, as the regular Thai staples apparently aren't exponentially better than other places .  When we went here we followed that advice and the meal knocked our socks off.  Over a year later I still wish I could go back again to order the Nam Khao Tod and the Crispy Duck.  Highest of high fives."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because it had such good reviews.  For the money I would go across the center and eat a Komol.  It is not as fancy but you will not get a Chinese food buffet either.

My friend ordered the blue crabs on noodles.  The noodles were good but she had to send the dish back because one a scale of 1 - 10 they seasoned it at least a 6 when she pointedly asked for a one.  When the dish came back it was lifeless and not worth eating.

I can't remember what I had, oh wait, some pork meat grilled.  It was tough and over priced."}
{"text":"Best Thai spot in Las Vegas. Order the Crispy Duck and Beef Short Rib Penang Curry. Make a reservation as they are often busy.  The restaurant is off the strip, but it is worth the voyage.  Ask your server for recommendations and they will lead you to goodness :)"}
{"text":"I lived and worked in Thailand for 16 years. Needless to say, I ate in many a Thai restaurant during my stay and I know what Thai food should taste like. When I arrived here in Vegas I heard about Lotus of Siam. Tried it for the first time today for lunch. My Thai wife and I ordered 3 dishes, glass noodle salad, fried fish cakes and beef noodle soup. Don't get me wrong now, I'm not saying the food was not edible. What I am saying is, they were not authentic. When you order a Thai dish in a restaurant that you have ordered many times before and get something that is not what you expect, it is disappointing.  Might go back for a second try. Maybe for dinner this time. Different chef may make a difference."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I love Lotus of Siam. :-) 

I highly recommend this place. I also encourage people to make reservations if possible. If you don't then expect to wait a really long time, even on a Tuesday night it was an hour wait. 

FOOD: The food is incredible. The dishes we ate were: Garlic Prawns, Chicken Pad Thai, Duck Fried Panang Curry w/ egg noodle. Squid Garlic and combination fried rice.  

My favorite dish is the Fried Duck Panang Curry w/ Egg Noodle. I wish we ordered two because sharing one place between five people just wasn't enough! The duck is fried so well and the crispy skin with the panang curry really completes the dish. We love egg noodle versus white rice so we added the egg noodle in, which is optional. 

The Garlic Prawns is another delicious item you must try. The batter it is fried in is so tasty! It is seasoned well and tastes great when you dip it in the panang sauce. The Squid garlic was very tender. The chicken pad thai and fried rice was like other Thai restaurants. There was nothing special about those dishes. 

PRICE: It was a little expensive, but if I had only gotten the garlic prawns and fried duck curry I am not sure if I would be saying that. For sure this restaurant charges higher end prices for great tasting food. 

SERVICE: The service was good. I did not have much to complain about it. We waited for an hour and the hostess came to get us right away. There's also a bar that you can sit at and grab a drink while you wait as well. The server was fast to take our order and bring our food out. He checked on us a few times, which is always a plus. 

AMBIANCE: The restaurant is big, but the tables are smaller and closer together. It's always so busy so it's extra loud. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're trying to have an intimate time with someone. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here again for the fried duck curry and garlic prawns. 

Happy Dining,

{"text":"Came with a friend who recently moved to Las Vegas. She hadn't yet been but said it was considered some of the best Thai food in the country. We arrived a bit early and ordered a Singha to share. They have an extensive wine list with many by the glass but we'd just come from Valley of Fire and were thirsty, so beer seemed to fit the bill.

It wasn't busy yet so we got a lot of time with our waiter and asked him what he recommended. The menu is pretty extensive and there are a lot of really interesting things to choose from, good descriptions too! He pointed out a few house specials and we ended up ordering entirely from his recommendations. We started off with the crispy rice and sausage appetizer. My boyfriend loved it. I thought it was spicy and salty but didn't taste like much.

Then, we ordered three dishes to share among three of us. Crispy duck with drunken noodles, short ribs in red curry, and the liver which the other two wanted to try. The crispy duck was by far the best of the three. Really delicious, good portion size too. The short ribs were amazing but there wasn't enough. I think there were four. For $20, I thought we'd get more than an appetizer size. But the sauce was really good over the rice. The liver tasted less like liver than I'm used to, the fresh lime and onion was really nice, but it was pretty dry and didn't come with any sauce. 

Overall, the ambiance of the place is okay. Not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable. We liked the food but it's pretty rich and we felt a little ill later in the evening. It was pretty expensive too! I enjoyed it but don't feel a need to come back.

I'm still trying to figure out how this place has over 700 reviews on Yelp and is so highly rated given that there is a lot of really good food in Las Vegas. It seems to have a very good PR person! I think it's unique and worth a visit but we had an incredible meal at a gorgeous Thai restaurant right off the strip  for much cheaper on a different night."}
{"text":"No joke. Now I know what all the hype is about. Excellent Thai cuisine. Enjoyed every kernel, sip, bite, smell, sight of the few dishes I sampled. Looking forward to return trip."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about trying this place, but my boyfriend said that it was pretty good, so I took his word for it.  

We arrived at about 7:15pm on a Friday and was I already nervous about the location.  At first, I thought that my boyfriend had made a mistake, but no, it's really in a strip mall.  Call my snobby, but I was definitely shocked.  I was also worried about showing up at this time without a reservation.  We were running late for another event, so yes, I was a bit nervous.  As soon as we got there, though, I was able to immediately get a table and a couple of menus. 

I thought that it was a little overpriced, and that our server was a bit slow in refilling our water glasses, but all in all, pretty good dining experience.  

We ordered the following (and yes, we had them bring everything out at once and we didn't have any leftovers either...definitely starving):

Beef Satay Sticks - so delicious and full of flavor

Chicken Satay Sticks - delicious too, but a bit tougher than the beef sticks (so we ate these last)

The accompanying cucumber salad was as good as expected.

Beef with Pepper Garlic Sauce - the portion was a little smaller than expected, but the garlic pepper sauce was just enough to complement the tenderness of the beef.

Sea Bass with Ginger - again, the portion was definitely a lot smaller than anticipated, and the sauce seemed to be a bit much for the portion of fish that they gave us, but again it was still delicious, although it felt like i was eating a soup rather than a sea bass dish.

I'll admit that I was pretty impressed that even though we told the guy that we were in a hurry and the place was fairly packed, we got our food within 15 minutes of ordering.  However, I guess that the guy was a bit too busy to check back on us about our drinks, since I had to flag him down twice to give me a water refill.  

My only gripes are about the sort of slow service and the portions, prices, and a bit of the food.  All in all, I'm definitely willing to return and try this place out a second time.   

Whenever I get around to making a return trip, I'm not sure, though, if I'll be able to try anything other than the beef satay or beef with garlic pepper sauce.  Those two dishes are definitely a favorite of mine, at least for now."}
{"text":"This has become a must for our guys' trips to Vegas. The food is so extremely cheap for the very high quality. The wine list is extensive but fairly priced. And the service is amazing...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't judge this restaurant by its sketchy location. I really wanted a view of my car while eating at this place for that reason, but the food made up for it.

 I decided to get a little weird and try the octopus salad. Tasty. Then, I tried bits and pieces of some co-workers' entrees and they were all delicious as well. Next time, I'll have to drench something in their yellow curry.

The dessert I had was delicious as well. It was a combination of lychee ice cream and some thing warm resembling fresh toast? I really can't remember the name, but if you see the word lychee, order it!

I would give the restaurant four stars, but the slow service brings my review down to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was my sixth visit and I was just as pleased as the first time in 2005 days after being relocated to Vegas Via Hurricane Katrina.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 . They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.  

Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced. Fabulous selection of Alsace, aromatic Austrian Riesling... We had a bottle of Trimbach Pinot Gris as well as a divine FX Pichler Smaragd Riesling from 2008. Dynamite with the Garlic Prawns!

When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the \"Senior\" dining hour. 
 
From Bern's in Tampa this time yesterday, to In-N-out for lunch, to this for dinner, I'm not sure if I'll be able to survive another 2 days in Vegas. I may have to hit some juice bars tomorrow. After a trip to Mount Charleston in the morning."}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS, hands down. 

I first heard about this place on yelp, because I was curious on what Thai restaurant in Vegas had the highest reviews, and it was this one!

Location: hidden in an unpopular plaza, and the sign saying \"lotus of Siam\" is quite outdated. From the outside it looks very small, but don't be fool, the restaurant is way bigger than it looks!

Interior: signs and many awards of the glorious food. And many celebrity photos hung around the walls. Also, they have carpet that is kept super clean! I didn't see one big stain at all! Once you enter you'll see a huge glass window, which they store their wines. Pretty cool I might say. 

Food: For the entrees, I got the chicken pad Thai ($10.95) and chicken panang ($12.95) which comes with one bowl of rice. 

Chicken Pad Thai ($10.95): seriously the best I've ever ate! They don't disappoint. Everything tasted so fresh and they had a good ratio between the noodles, meat, and veggies. Other Thai restaurants they put too much green sprouts in the noodle and/or they put too much eggs or cook the egg weird. They made sure everything tasted perfectly. 

Chicken panang ($12.95): I was super excited to try this. I got a 3/10 for spice level since I don't like too spicy. I tasted this curry, and it's by far the best curry I ever had. The curry wasn't too thick and it was at an accurate, mild spice. I definitely would get this every time I go there! It's a must have!

Fried bananas ($8.50): i was nervous that the fried part of the banana would be overbearing and make me sick but it totally didn't. The fried bananas aren't oily at all. It came out crispy and they added shredded coconut in the fried bananas also. They lightly put powdered sugar and caramel sauce on it. Definitely a great way to end my meal! 

Thai tea ($2.50): Thai tea at other places are way too sweet but this place didn't make me feel like I was gonna have diabetes. The Thai tea tasted heavenly. The creamer that they put in their Thai tea definitely makes their drink stand out from other restaurants. 

Service: I made reservations at 7:30pm on a Monday night. We got sat down right when we came inside and once we ordered our food, we received it within 10-15mins! Not a long wait at all! I like how they were smiling and always refilling our waters without us asking them. This restaurant was busy, but they were running things very smoothly. I ended up giving a few more dollars in tips because of their service :]

Cons: Entrees are pretty pricey for small portions and I didn't like how they gave us the check right when we got our desserts. I felt very rushed and agitated since there were several people waiting for a table. 

Overall, GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE! I love lotus of Siam!!"}
{"text":"I always go to at least one restaurant off the strip when I am in Vegas. Someone told me that Lotus of Siam was on a food show and the Yelp reviews were good, so we decided to give it a try. This is located in an obscure strip mall. We almost missed it, but we saw a lot of people waiting outside so we figured we were in the right place. We went inside and because there was only 2 of us, we got seated right away. The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and spacious.  The busser brought our drinks very quickly. 

We decided to try the Nua Nam Tok (BBQ beef dish) and the garlic pepper prawns (both under the BBQ in the menu). The food came out pretty quickly. The food was pretty amazing. The beef dish had tons of spices (cilantro, mint, green onion, red onion - just to name a few) that worked well together. It was so good! Be careful how spicy you get it. We got it medium and our mouth was on fire at the end of the meal. The BBQ prawns were my favorite. The shrimp, which came with an amazing garlic pepper sauce, was so good and tender. Its definitely a must try. It's a little on the pricey side at $25 for 8 prawns, but I would definitely get it again. 

Overall, I am so glad that I decided to give this place a try. One minor complaint that I have is that we only saw our waiter twice, once to take out order and once to take our check. We ended up flagging down another waiter when we wanted to order additional rice. But, it was not too big of a deal as the other waiters was willing to help us.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes here. (There menu is very expansive and I would like to try other items)."}

{"text":"Best Pad Thai anywhere. Spectacular curry dishes featuring duck and short ribs. Garlic prawns were super."}

{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the USA and I've been to Thailand for 3 weeks and to some of the top Thai populated places in America (NYC, SF, LA, etc).

Lotus of Siam's flavors and prices are just greatness. Don't get the usual boring pad thai and chicken satays, go for the unique dishes like spicy red duck curry, coconut shrimp specialties, and any of the house specials. Everything is great.

It's only a few min, very short cab ride from the city, you could technically even walk there if you're near Spring Mountain. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!  The place doesn't look like much on the outside, but you won't be disappointed!  Make sure to get your reservation in weeks in advance : )."}
{"text":"When a place advertises itself as \"The Best _____________ restaurant in the US\" I was understandably skeptical.  But my skepticism evaporated with the first bites of the NAM KAO TOD   (Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice.)  The flavours, and textures, of this appetizer and everything else I tried (the \"chicken wings\" are unlike anything you've had anywhere: deep fried until crispy then sauteed with chili, garlic, and topped with crispy mint leaves.)  Try the Sea Bass as well.

Who cares about decor, strip mall location, etc?  You are here to eat!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Las Vegas overall. Eaten here over 50 times over the last 4 years living in LV. Lotus has had a few slight ups and downs in that time, mostly in regards to speed of service. In spring of this year they apparently hired a ton of new wait/server staff, and they are a young professional crew who do a fantastic job. The half dozen or so times  I've been there this summer the service level has been exemplary. Their cuisine is the most consistently delicious of any restaurant I've ever dined in, including dozens of michelin starred and james beard nominated. The best kept secret of Lotus' menu is the deep fried Lobster. It's always at least 5 lbs and runs $145 per, must call ahead to order or inquire as to the availability of Lobster. It's deep fried in the shell, then cut in sections and pan fried with corn starch sauce and veggies. The result is moist, flavorful lobster meat that comes out of the shell in perfect huge chunks! It wan't until about a year ago that my wife and I first had the lobster, we asked on a flyer on a monday night and they sold us one that was leftover from a party they night before. I guess they pre-ordered 10 and only ate 9, so we ordered it for just the two of us. There was a big party of about 20 ppl in the adjacent room and they came over in shifts to take pictures of our lobster, it's really that much of a spectacle! Other must try dishes include but not limited to: Short Rib in Panang, Drunken Noodle Prawn, Roasted Duck Curry, Crispy Catfish Salad, and I enjoy the snapper with thai chili and basil preparation. If you are visiting alone or with a group of 30 this is the place to go! Local tip: If you show up when they open (5:30) for dinner without a reservation, expect a 5-15 minute wait. 6-8:30pm expect a wait of 1hr+, after 8:30 10-20 minutes depending on the day. Make a reservation ahead of time, and don't be more than 5 minutes late or they'll cancel it."}
{"text":"What a joke. Went with family that said they love the place. Poor service and he food was just ok. I can get better Thai food in southern. The only reason that I gave them one star was because I could not give them less than one.  

We asked wha they recommended and had duck and chicken and it was cold and the curry was as watery as chicken noodle soup. The fried rice tastes like old grease.  Had to ask for spice just to add flavor to the curry. 

Never again......"}
{"text":"Place is in a very obscure area, almost didn't go in cause of the environment. New this was lunch time on a Friday and this place was crowded. Lobby big enough for maybe a total of 6 people to sit in and wait. Hate to see how it gets at dinner time. Now to the food. Food was pretty good, not the best tasting Thai food I've eaten. But I'm from So Cal so we have much more options, but again it was decent. My biggest gripe was they are stingy on the amount they give you. I went to a Thai restaurant in Hollywood, had way more food, with a extra entree, that tasted much better and it was still $5 dollars less. We needed to take some of that food home. Here, we left hungry. And before you assume we're probably fat, well we're not."}
{"text":"Three of us met for dinner last night so we could share different dishes and try more.  We ordered seven items and asked the server to space them out.  

First was the tom yum kai soup at medium spiciness.  The soup was good, had a fair amount of chicken, but was missing in straw mushrooms.  Before we had much time to enjoy the soup, two more dishes were brought out.  So much for spacing.

The first was nam kao tod which the menu describes as crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice.  The crispy rice were very present but cubed pork was almost flavorless.  The dish was really lacking.  Along with this, we were served the nam prik ong, spicy red chili dip served with vegetables and some fried pork rind.  The chili was flavorful and I found putting it on the rinds was the best way to eat it.  Crunchy texture and heat.

We were then brought the khao soi with beef and the thum ka noon with chicken.  Both dishes were OK.  The winning dish was the khao soi.  Very flavorful with outstanding noodles.  This was one of two dishes that were very good.  I thought the thum ka noon was watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.  

The one dish which was the other star of our meal was forgotten.  We had to have our server come back to the table and remind him that we had ordered the garlic prawns.  We were brought our order.  The prawns were good and the crispy outer shells very delightful.

I had a diet Coke which was refilled several times without asking.  Service was good but I wish they had spaced the dishes out more so we had a little more time with each dish.  

This was my second time at Lotus of Siam.  I think I'd be back only if I wanted to try something different in Thai food.  It was disappointing."}
{"text":"I heard of people raving about this place and friends visiting from NYC wanted to try it so we went there for lunch. I really don't know what the rave is all about or I may have went in with too high of an expectation. We wanted to try their best dishes so we asked the waiter what was good so he named the 3 most popular dishes they are known for.

Dish #1: Garlic Prawns, this dish was good and unique in how they deshell the shrimp while leaving shell attached, deep frying whole shrimp and tossing it in their garlic sauce. The shrimp and shell are edible in two parts with a nice crisp in shell. The only problem I had was for a restaurant with such high recognition, is serve people bad shrimp. When the shell and legs of the shrimp are black it usually means its spoiled and when it smells, it means it is. I only found one piece that was bad but it is one piece too much.

Dish #2 Sea bass with drunken noodles, the sea bass was good but did not compliment the noodles. The meat or seafood you put on top of noodles should give it some of its flavor or compliment each other which it didn't. The dish was different but just didn't work for any of us.

Dish #3 Crispy duck with penang curry,  this was another dish that we thought was an awkward pairing. I mean once you put curry sauce on the crispy duck there is nothing crispy about it and duck with curry just doesn't work. The panang curry was good, we didn't care for the duck.

We also had other dishes and we weren't wowed so I'm only breaking down 3 most popular dishes. This is a Thai Fusion restaurant and that's what they should call it. Yes some dishes are unique and different but our group thought the sea bass drunken noodle and crispy duck panang curry didn't pair too well. The service and basic Thai food is good so I gave them 2 stars because I consider it an overpriced average Thai Fusion restaurant with nothing to make me go out of my way to go dine there."}
{"text":"Found Lotus of Siam through internet research 3 years ago and it was the best food find in Las Vegas I've ever had.  A trip to Las Vegas isn't complete without coming here for dinner. Make sure and research the menu prior to coming as there's literally over 100 entrees to pick you 2-3 choices.  Getting recommendations from your server is good advice.  You can't go wrong as the food quality is top notch and expect some of the best Thai you've ever had.  It's a $20 taxi ride from LV strip and make sure and get reservations.  Be aware they only hold your reservation for 5 minutes, so get here early if on Fri-Sun night."}
{"text":"Good food but can be pricey with small portions. Busy so hard to get service and tends to be a wait. I would pass on the Tom yum soup, but everything else we had was good (garlic prawns, sea bass drunken noodles, pad Thai, boat noodle, nam kao tod, fried banana with coconut ice cream). Seafood options usually over $20 and everything else we had was around $10."}
{"text":"Food took forever, but it was delicious.
I wish I knew what I ate, but my cousin the foodie did the ordering.

My first visit here last September, I didn't love the food because she ordered a bit too exotic for me. 

This next visit, she played it safe and ordered the beef and noodles, some jalapeno shrimp on cabbage thing, and I can't remember what else. 
I must say the \"noodles,\" which aren't very noodley but rather flat and wide and irregular shaped, were fantastic. The shrimp dish was good, but I had to wipe some of the peppers off.  our appetizer was yummmmmmy too, chicken on a stick :)

The mouse-sh*t pepper condiment nearly killed me, but they were delicious.

Only complaint (besides the wait between appetizer and entree) would be the rice. It was a bit hard in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food is everything it was hyped to be. Clear, sharp flavors and in particular the texture of the meats was just perfect. Boneless duck crispy fried to perfection, luxuriously melting short ribs that still didn't taste greasy, and dry sausage that was redolent of chiles and lime.

Service was very good and our waiter knew the menu inside and out, answering every one of my questions. The service is also very fast.

The inside of the restaurant is nice enough - not modern or hip in any way but nicer than your average Thai. The location is straight ghetto, but never fear, you'll be accompanied by a steady stream of taxis, limos, and others making the sojourn this many blocks from the Strip. It's not a secret, this place.

The only flaw - a minor one in the scheme of things - is that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food ordered. The portions are quite modest. You will need to order at least one entree per adult and possibly more.

Is this the best Thai I've ever eaten? I don't know - it was pretty darn good. And a lot of the dishes simply aren't available at your nearest Thai joint. Experiment a little - this is not the place to get panang curry and pad thai, even if they happen to be really good.

This is a definite keeper, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is now a Vegas tradition of mine. It's my second time here but first time at this location. The decor was very nice but the charm of the old location wasn't there. I missed all of the celebrity photos plastered on the walls too. My husband and I shared the garlic black pepper chicken wings and the the stuffed chicken wings for our appetizer. For my dinner entree I ordered the crispy duck khao soi with a spicy level 8 out of 10. The curry was smooth and the coconut definitely shined through. I did expect it to be more spicy especially since my husband's panang curry was a spicy level 6 and was spicier than my dish. I loved the Thai lime drink! It reminded me of a virgin Brazilian Caipirinha. The service was great and super attentive. A reservation is a must here and super easy through their website. Best Thai food ever!"}
{"text":"To be honest I always think about this place whenever I visit Las Vegas. Everything here is simply amazing and full of flavor. Only downside is sometimes they are extremely busy due to their popularity. I recommend calling first and if line is too long then order take out which is great as well. definitely one of my favorites in vegas !"}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for 8 months some years back, and am usually disappointed by Thai food in the US.  Its too timid, too sweet, or just plain not great.  And Thai food should be great.  Well, last night I was transported back to the streetside restaurants of Bangkok, and ate the best Thai meal I have enjoyed since I left that jewel of a country.  Here are a few highlights: som tam - as bombing as it should be, but if you don't like spice stay away from that one!  Snow crab with ginger, apples, lime and more.  Wow!  An entire deep fried catfish that was the most perfectly fried fish you can imagine, and came served with some incredible sweet and spicy sauce; crispy duck in green curry that was the best prepared duck I have ever had (think a skin that defines crispy, succulent meat, and not a drip of fat to be found), in a super flavorful curry with bamboo shoots; Chinese broccoli with deep fried pork lardons - call the doctor!  And many other great dishes we could share with our large party.  Some of the stuff just came out from the kitchen when they realized we were not there for Pad Thai and spring rolls.  In every way, the service was exceptional, and when the bill came I could not have been more happy.  After two days of overpriced Strip restaurants that offer more flash than flavor, this was just what the doctor ordered - authentic, huge flavors and great value.  There is a good reason why so many people rave about this place.  It rocks!  Kap khun kap Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"The decor is excellent and the service is great.  However, a word from of advice - RESERVE ahead, unless you have a few hours to wait around...  The food was pretty good, especially the GARLIC shrimp.  Very crispy and tasteful but on the pricey side.  The TOM YUM KUNG soup is too sour for me but they were able to adjust it for my needs.  The curry DUCK is good too.   Will have to revisit again to check out the other dishes.."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious and was refreshing after all the fast food we had been eating on The Strip. Definitely make a reservation beforehand to avoid the wait. Parking was easy. 

Our server was super nice and attentive! Beware that the portions aren't huge. Highly recommend the papaya salad--perfect amount of spice. We also ordered the massaman curry (pretty standard) and the drunken noodle with duck (soooo good). Of course we had to end our meal with mango sticky rice, which had a generous amount of mango."}
{"text":"We came here on the last day of our Vegas stay and are looking forward to return some time in the near future.  I do not know how long the wait time is usually, as we went right when they opened shop.  By the time we were done however, there was a line at the door.  We ordered many dishes and they all were flavorful and delicious.  One of my buddies was asking why we hadn't came here earlier.  Anyways, if you are looking for good Thai food in the Vegas area, Lotus of Siam is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"The highlight of our Vegas trip. Each year it gets crowded and crowded! The wait was 1 hour, featured on Anthony Bourdain  no reservations. Must try mussuman yellow curry with seafood, drunken noodle with vegetables, spicy pork, egg rolls, papaya salad and spicy beef liver. In the midst of a ghetto shopping  mall you will find this place. The place to Thai for in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people feel this restaurant is overrated. 

But I am a huge fan since this is the only place in the Valley I have been able to find a decent bowl of khao soi! The ma muang khao neuw is always excellent as well, made with palm sugar and served only when mangoes are in season!

I have not been to LOS in some time, so I was pleasantly surprised by the new renovations!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is phenomenal!! It's located in a strange strip mall (the first time I brought my parents, they said they thought I was taking them to a seedy strip club!), but once inside, it looks and feels like your average casual thai restaurant. Be sure to make reservations - it can be an extremely long wait without one.

Absolutely everything I have tried on this menu is good. In addition to the more typical dishes, they have a lot of really good catfish entrees - my favorite is the catfish salad, which has a delicious charred and limey taste. They also have some phenomenal soft shell crab dishes! Every single soup is good, especially the tom kha gai (I recommend ordering it very mild if you don't like spice!).

Lotus is pretty out-of-the-way from where I live, but we make the trip there routinely - it is so worth it. If possible, go with a big group so that you can try a big variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've EVER had. Get everything. 'Nough said. 
Come when it opens and maybe you'll be seated fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Best. Damn. Service. Period and the food is incredible too. There is nothing I can say about this place that is anything be great. The food, the service, the atmosphere - all excellent. We visited for lunch and could have stayed through dinner. Everything was perfect (although we only ate vegetarian and a bit of fish/shrimp). Every order around us looked incredible too. My only complainant is I don't live close enough to come back any tine soon."}
{"text":"After dropping off and picking up Uber riders from this restaurant and hearing that it was good. Finally tried it out and wasn't disappointed! Ordered the vegetable fried rice with chicken and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I really want to give this place five stars, but I can't. Yes, the food is delicious but outside the Khao Soi, everything else can be found at nearby Komol and Arawan for cheaper and without the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"This white boy likes the duck soup."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Lotus of Siam for years, but never had the chance to during my past Vegas trips. This time, I made sure to set aside time to go here for dinner on the first night of the trip. Reservations are almost impossible to get, so I took the advice from several reviews, and showed up at 5pm on a Thursday, which is when they open for dinner. The restaurant was almost completely empty when we got there, but quickly filled up in the next hour.

The famous garlic prawns are worth the hype! They are fried to perfection, and the flavor is so good that they are almost addicting to eat. Another dish I was super excited to try was the crispy duck khao soi, which comes with crispy noodles in a curry sauce. Honestly, I was not a huge fan. The flavor was very diluted and lacked taste. The egg noodles quickly turned soggy and the duck was just okay.

Overall, decent but overpriced for Thai food; expect to spend ~$100 for dinner for 2. Personally, I would rather go to a Vegas buffet (Bacchanal, anyone?). But if you do find yourself here, make sure the order the garlic prawns!"}
{"text":"Super Busy!!! Obviously, this is where all the locals of Las Vegas go to get Thai food. It's located way off the strip past Sahara. When my husband and I parked we were a little anxious because the location is in a not so nice looking plaza strip with lots of-careful cuz you might get robbed-signage!! 
However, there's a reason locals come to a joint and that is the food is actually really good! Quite authentic. I didn't care for the Tom Ka soup, but the pad Thai noodles, and fish dish (can't remember the name) were excellent! 
I suggest coming earlier in the day so you don't feel so intimidated by the location and enjoy some nicely prepared Thai food."}
{"text":"2nd visit for us during the 4th of July week! This time I had garlic drunken noodle.  It was delish!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times in the past years. I guess when the restaurant has already built their reputation they don't watch the quality of their food. 

Ordered for two: Garlic Prawns and Braised Short Ribs in Padang curry. 

Garlic Prawns excellent as always! 

Braised Short Ribs in Padang curry such a disappointment. Yes beef is tender but for sure it wasn't short ribs. I am a great home cook and I know my ingredients. I also had order this dish many times before, but this time really disappointed with the quality of the beef."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the real deal. I love hidden gems.

When our taxi driver took us to downtown, and into a strip mall, me and the boys had raised eyebrows. But we stuck it out because the reviews are off the charts, and for good reason.

The food is amazing. The cost is so reasonable too. Love, love, love, this place. The Nam Kao Tod is a must. It is so awesome, I cannot even explain it. Just get it.

The drunken noodles are perfect. The crispy duck is the duck is the way to go, but you cannot go wrong with anything here.

Great food. Great prices. Great service. Just great."}
{"text":"Well, I'm Thai born and raised with a family that runs resturants in the DC and Bangkok area and this is by far the best food outside of Thailand.  I can't say it's the best in the country because I haven't eaten everywhere but out of San Francisco, DC, LA and NYC, this is top 3 on my list.  They serve northern and eastern regional cuisine as well as your more usual pad thai, pad see eew (what my chinese friends call chowfun :-).   You'd be making a mistake if you only come here for the buffet.  Order something from the menu, try something from the regional list cuz this might be the only place you'll every come across it.

Warning:  You should order \"down\" in spiciness.  If you're use to eating medium at a 5 (with 10 being barely eatible by a Thai person), then you should get a 3.  A 5 here is NOT medium and you can always have them increase the spiciness if it's too mild but you can't go the other way."}
{"text":"Food was OK wine list was above average. I may go back if friends really wanna go, I really was not impressed."}
{"text":"went back again and had the crispy rice salad, which i was craving, the issan sausages, the number 58 (spicy beef on cabbage), red northern curry, pad thai. delicious. 

i'm glad i tried a lot of these different dishes this time. the curry is not the thick coconut based kind. it's more like a light soup with curry flavors. very delicious and not heavy at all. the sausage was great, too though i do prefer mine with more acidity (like at ord noodles in thai town, LA). the #58 was a hit. we asked for it extra spicy and thought we were going to die. just the way we like it. the pad thai was good, too. 

we asked the servers what to get and got what they recommended. after we ate, we realized we should have taken heed to one of their suggestions to get lobster. darn... it looked so good, teasing us from another table."}
{"text":"We were a bit disappointed by the taste of the food. The crispy duck panang is very good with a nice panang coconut curry. But the Thai papaya salad and the en tuan soup was a downer. The salad is crowded with blend stiff papaya without much other ingredients nor too much flavor. The soup on the other extreme has too much spice such that it tastes excessive of star anise. 

The coconut ice cream with sweet rice was good, although at time there was clumps in the rice and chunks of ice in the coconut ice cream that broke the texture of this dessert."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I heard good things about this place. I ordered Pad Se-ew and the chicken was very dry. The portion size is small compared to most places! It was a little pricey for the quality. I was charged 10.95 for Pad Se-ew and this price on here says 8 .95."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food. Service can be hit or miss depending on your server but I would wait hours to eat the food here. Can't give you one recommendation because everything on the menu is fantastic.  Plan ahead to make your reservations as they book up quickly.  Last time I visited, Anthony Bourdain was filming here and Rocky Patel was dining here with a group from Cigar Aficionado. This place is officially no longer a secret as it was when I first visited shortly after the current owners took over in '99. Bring your appetite and prepare to be treated to a Thai delight."}
{"text":"By far our favorite place to eat in Vegas. We are actually thinking about trying to go back again before we leave. Everything was excellent. EVERYTHING!!  Service, food, new location. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Impressed. If I could use any word to describe the experience I had, it's just that: impressed. I ordered the Diet Coke. Being that this was a new restaurant, I could tell the soft subtleties that emerge only from that of a fresh dispenser. The supple hint of vanilla, the light crispness of the sweet cola flavor, and one could not forget the ever present note of artificial sweetener. The soda was presented with a lime, which, while usually not preferred, appeared to be the best of the best of limes and I would not have it any other way."}
{"text":"Here is a rating for food and presentation...
Five stars for presentation and the beautiful restaurant!
3/5 stars on food and although the food portions are good for 1-2 people, there wasn't an, \"oh my god, it's delicious!\" moment. ( and we all know that's what we aim for!) Our bill was pretty typical so I can't complain on pricing and portioning ($43 for an appetizer and two entrees)."}
{"text":"OMG this place lives up to the hype! We were one dish short and couldn't decide so we let the serer pick and he was spot on with recommending a fish dish. Note: only dinner reservations no lunch reservations. Get here early or come later after the rush. It's definitely worth the cab ride over from the strip."}
{"text":"I've been here once and have heard many great things as well as it being the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. It was very crowded and the food was decent, but there are other places I prefer here in town."}
{"text":"Don't let the shabby exterior fool you - this strip mall restaurant was once voted the best Thai food in America by the late Gourmet magazine. Reservations are definitely recommended. The chef-owner, Saipin Chutima, was voted \"Best Chef: Southwest\" in 2010. The restaurant's specialty is Issan-style Thai food, from the northeastern region of the country. The only problem you might have here is trying to choose which one of the 150 menu options to order. People who are lucky enough to eat here often spend a week researching the menu online beforehand to make the best selection."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Friday, 11:30am arrival. Table for 4, no wait, but the restaurant was packed 30 minutes later. No reservations for lunch, FYI.

If you're on a time crunch, I'd browse the menu online beforehand so you have a good idea of what you want to order. The menu is like a book! So many options! I wanted to try it all!

We ordered:
1. #56 NUA SAO RENU Sliced charbroiled beef served on beds of sliced cabbages, topped with our homemade tamarind sauce and fried dry chili. $17.95
2. #39 SOM THUM [Thai Papaya Salad]  green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed
peanuts mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. $8.95
3. GARLIC PRAWNS Deep fried prawns with shellls (almost like potato chips), sautéed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper. $26.95
4. CRISPY DUCK DRUNKEN NOODLE Crispy duck topped with fresh homemade chili and Thai basils. Served on the top of pan fried flat rice noodles. $25.95
5. Fried banana dessert $8 plus coconut ice cream $4. These two go together heavenly, but the star really was the coconut ice cream.
6. Thai iced tea x 4.  The Thai tea here is really good. Not over sweet like other Thai restaurants. The tea flavor really comes through.


Pros:
1. Delicious food. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order again.
2. Lot of variety on the menu. Especially Northern Thai dishes
3. Fresh ingredients. You can taste the quality.

Cons:
1. Pricey for Thai food, 4 dishes + 4 thai teas = $110 after tax, before tip. Yikes.
2. Can be a long wait depending on what time you go

Verdict: Totally worth it! The food here is amazing. It's a must visit restaurant on my Vegas list.

Pro-tips:  
1. GO STRAIGHT TO THE BACK OF THE MENU TO TRY THE NORTHERN THAI DISHES 
2. Go with a bigger group if you want to try more dishes!
3. Beware of the spiciness levels! Thai spicy is no joke! We got level 2 and it was pretty spicy for me and I'm usually great about handling spicy foods."}
{"text":"First of all, I know my Thai food and I'm Thai. I had my bachelor party dinner here. I told our waiter (in Thai) and told him to bring out their best food that would feed 9 hungry dudes. He smiled and walked away. The meals included appetizers, soups, and many main courses. Two of my so-cal Asian friends declared \"This is the best damnThai food I ever had\" - granted they ate at many fine Thai establishments in so.cal. I would have agreed with my friends if I wasn't a regular at Thaitown in Hollywood. Our total meal was about $80 per person - so about $650+ plus many alcohol drinks. 

Anyway, this place is a 5 star for sure. It was a fine meal. The price is a bit high but I'm sure it's lower than your high-end buffet cost in Vegas. 

Don't know what to order there? sweet talk your waiter or waitress and ask for an omakase. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Most authentic, delicious Thai food in all of Las Vegas! Great for a dinner date or order family style for large parties! Make a reservation, though. This is no secret! 14 of us were there last night for my friend's birthday and had crunchy rice, beef salad, tom kao kai soup, chicken curry, duck, scallops, and fried bananas! All were amazing! The waitress reccomended fried prawns, but we didn't care much for those. We had 4 bottles of wine (did I mention they have a ridiculously huge wine list?) and paid just $60pp for the drinkers and $45pp for the nondrinkers! We Love Lotus of Siam and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"by far the BEST thai food i've ever had. it brings shame to any thai bbq and sanamluang locations. the food screams authenticity and different flavors associated with thai cooking - yes, there is more than lemon grass, coconut milk, and curry powder! there are levels of spiciness and the owner is a connoisseur of german white wines. he can match any dish with the right wine. how superb! just make sure you know what you are asking for when you ask for \"spicy\". dinner is the best deal. for lunch, there is a buffet, however, it rids of the entire atmosphere. (if you want a buffet in vegas, eat at the rio!) there are tons and tons of items to try- all the more reason to come back. i think we ordered about 7-8 dishes and paid a little over 100, including tax and tip. we were only a party of 3! now that is good dining!

the location and the setting isnt what you would expect of the restuarant. it's off the strip (which is a good and bad thing), located in a plaza. just dont judge a book by its cover. come hungry and talk to the owner if he's there. he's a really nice guy!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant hands down. Where do I even begin!? We arrived during dinner rush, but honestly they're probably busy at any hour since it's been featured on Food Network, among other places. It is handy that they had iPads set up to where they can text you when they're ready to seat your party. There is also a bar area and a waiting room so you don't have to wait outside. Before dinner, we grabbed beers and Thai tea to drink in the waiting room while being able to sit and relax inside. They have photos of celebrities from movie stars to Food Network shows all over their walls, and the owner of the restaurant which was also the chef, popularly walked around to tables with which seemed to be many regulars praising him and greeting him. Our table was ready and we ordered the prawns which seemed to be most popular on all of the tables, and a duck noodle. Mind you, I'm not a fan of duck but it was crisp and fried to perfection in the most perfect sauce. The prawns were huge and flavorful. We also had a steak dish that came with a small sauce that is to die for. What had me was that they offer the Laos papaya salad that not many other places do. We ordered a spice level of 10 and we were dying but it was literally perfection. Everything was extremely good. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of mango sticky rice, so we settled for a fried banana and ice cream, which tasted similar to Filipino banana lumpia, but they were cut up into small pieces for an easier family style and small portioning. Guaranteed I will visit this place every time I go to Vegas. You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am nauseous just thinking about the after-effects of my Lotus of Siam experience. 

FOOD POISONING.

I went here on Friday night (1/15/10), my last night in Vegas after living here for 10 weeks for work. It was supposed to be legendary, and in some ways, I guess it was. 

I had the Panang curry with chicken. In all truth, it was quite delicious. Without the sickness that would follow the next 24 hours, this would be 4 stars. My stomach has only now recovered enough to allow me to write a review without feeling like I am going throw up again. 

I was with three other people, nobody else got sick. But this was all I had to eat that night, my previous meal was at Top of the World at Stratosphere for lunch, and was 7 hours before LOS, and my only drink of the night was the Thai beer I had with my meal, so I think it is safe to assume that the food here caused the illness. 

So there you go, food poisoning. Delicious food, but you might end up paying dearly for it later."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food I have ever had.  The menu is extensive, and I do not think you can go wrong with whatever you order.  I will share my favorites though:

* Tom Yum Kai Soup: a little sour, a little spicy, but a lot of flavor
* Crispy Duck with Mint and Chili: very crispy duck skin flavored with just the right amount of spice
* Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab: I am not sure why this is called drunken noodles, but it did not make me drunk.
* Nua Yang Panang (Charbroiled beef with Thai red curry and cognac): This did make me a little drunk..."}
{"text":"This place is apparently always booked, which is a good sign. People of all walks of life in here, enjoying good food. My GF and I walked in on a Tuesday night around 7 with no reservation and waited for our table to be ready while at the bar. They have a decent beer selection and a plethora of wines in their cellar. I didn't see any liquor other than sake (if you count that). We got sat within 30 minutes and our servers were quite attentive and informative. We had the Thai hot wings which were sweet and spicy, good. Tom Fun Kai soup next; limey and a spiciness at the end, interesting and good aswell. We ended with the famous garlic prawns, which did live up to the hype. Crispy and juicy tails with a crunchy kettle cooked chip-like shell. Will be back for those."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant blows all others in the U.S. off the charts based on the scale of the wine list, the menu options, and the quality of the food. What other Thai restaurant includes a whole page of \"Northern Thai\" specialties, or has so many varieties of seafood options? Everything that I saw served here looked amazing. My dinner date and I enjoyed a very tender Satay to begin, some Tom Kha Kai soup that was beautiful and extraordinary, and two incredible entrees. My friend had Pad Thai -- I tasted some of it, and it was among the best I've experienced and in large portions. I enjoyed the Drunken Noodles with seafood. For $12.99, my plate was filled with large egg noodles, a spicy sauce, and huge chunks of lobster, crab, scallops and shrimp. This may be the best value in Vegas, and it truly is one of the best Thai restaurants in the U.S."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food I've had since I went to Thailand. It will be I my \"must@ list every time I come to Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Service was great. Area is horrible but worth it. Favorite thing is the hot wings medium spicy with a side of rice. Its on the appetizer section but can be a meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"So apparently I made it before the roof collapse!!! Went for by birthday over this past Labor Day weekend. We had the Crispy Duck with Panang, Garlic Prawns and Pad thai. All were excellent.  The portions are a little small, but the quality is excellent. It's in this sketchy strip mall off the strip. Don't let that fool you. The place is legit and hoppin! Tons of celebrity pics on the walls and always a wait.  Hopefully they open up soon!"}
{"text":"This is a James Beard award winner. Not too far from the strip. Large parking lot. Outside doesn't give much too look at but inside is visual appealing. Don't let the lot deceive you.  

Came in about an hour after opened for dinner  Wait time was close to an hour. Not bad. They will call or text you. Staff was friendly. We waited and ordered some drinks at bar. One drink was thai iced tea. Good amount of citrus to tea. 


When we got seated for dinner, beverage and food order was taken  and delivered at a reasonable time. Our Order included but not limited to Tom kha kai soup, pad thai, khao soi with short rib, duck paanang curry, and pork belly. Each dish stood out on it's own. 

The tom kha soup was creamy, coconut, mushroom, protein, and citrus. A nice mix match of sweetness, savory, and spices. Unexpectedly overwhelming delicious soup. 

Pad Thai with chicken was one of the best I have tried. Nice balance of noodles, eggs, sprouts, chicken in sauce. 

Pork belly with peppers and Chinese. greens. Not fatty pork belly mixed with the others in a light style sauce crisp Chinese greens. Good dish. Not my personal like for pork belly but not as fatty as I like. 

Khao Soi -Short Rib was one of two khao dishes. The one we ordered was one of the specialty dishes. The tender seasoned short rib was nestled within crispy noodles, green, and some of the best curry sauce. Not overly hot. The sauce I could just drink. It was that delicious. 

Duck paanang Curry. Oh my. Oh my. It's a flavor explosion. Freaking awesome curry sauce. Spices. Lean tender duck. Lots of duck. This curry was also one of the best.

Good. Anything curry. Any of the dishes. Personal favorite the short rib and paanang but really all the dishes, service, and experience. 
Bad. You can encounter wait times but worth it.

I'll be back someday."}
{"text":"So I am very sad to write this review of lotus of Siam. I have been to Lotus of Siam years ago In Las Vegas in their old location. I was jumping off my seat because the food was exceptionally delicious. It was such a popular restaurant that a lot of celebrity chefs have been there. I believe this is what happened they upgraded the restaurant to a better location with more seating. They made it look fancier, but they ruined their food. They had many employees it seemed like but they brought our drinks after our food was served and when we asked them. Otherwise they would've forgotten about us. They were definitely busy. But you cannot bring the drinks after the food was served. They made the location glamorous and beautiful but their food was just ok. I ordered the crispy fried rice salad, and the crispy duck Panang along with a Thai iced tea. 
Crispy fried rice salad was spicy, however the rice which is supposed to be crispy wasn't as crispy as I had it before. It did not taste fresh. It seemed like they made it maybe two hours ago not when we ordered it. To me that destroyed the whole dish. The crispy duck Panang did not taste the same I ordered years ago. The duck had a very crispy skin last time I ordered it. This time it wasn't as crispy. The sauce was still nice and creamy but the whole dish did not have a wow factor to it like before. The ice tea was fine just like anywhere else. I hate the fact when restaurants upgrade their furniture, decor, and location and along with that they increase the prices on food. I just don't believe it's fair to the customer. This time we went, the price was very high. I would've not have minded paying that much if the food quality was phenomenal but it wasn't.  So it is a disappointment. None of the dishes stood out for me. Sorry guys but you better work on your food again because decoration and glamour is really not important. What is really important is food that is delicious and fresh. I'm very upset to write a review like this for you but I have no choice, you guys really changed since last time I visited you. The highlight of my trip to Vegas was coming to this restaurant but it's no longer going to be like that :(."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas countless times and I can't believe I haven't eaten here! It was so bomb. 

I can't remember all the dishes we got, but we tried to go for the non-traditional Thai dishes. We had the soft shell crab noodle dish and a curry one and crispy shrimp. We also ordered a bamboo rice which was a bit sticky but necessary to order. 

The wait can be crazy, especially on a weekend night, but we called ahead and asked if we could put our name down. She told us she wouldn't be able to take our name down over the phone but she did direct us to the website where we could join the wait list. That was the best idea ever. We stayed at our hotel for a few minutes, made our way down and by the time we got to the restaurant 20 minutes later, we were seated within a minute. Another family that had walked in right after us were quoted one hour. So that's the secret. Put yourself on the waitlist online. You'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Eating Thai food from Thailand in Las Vegas, NV... its really that simple.

Lets start with where its located... A ways off the north end of the strip in a shopping mall plaza that you wouldn't stumble across even after the most crazy night in Vegas if you weren't looking for it.  
Now that we have that over with, when you walk in you realize why this place has garnered its reputation.
The food is simply phenomenal. I mean, I've been to Thailand, gone to a Thai cooking class, and eaten every kind of street food there and Lotus of Siam was essentially the same thing minus the plane flight. The dishes were incredible, from the traditional Northern Thai (pork-based) dishes they are known for, to the duck, to the pineapple rice and stuffed chicken wings.

Without question order food family-style, don't eat the whole day before you go, and stuff your face when you are there.

We felt so amazed by the experience, that we demanded to personally thank the chef, which we were able to do (and of course snapped a photo of the occasion).

A must for anyone looking for some of the most authentic thai food in the US."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  This is the best Thai food you're ever going to eat.  You're also going to think you're on your way to a drug deal when you near the restaurant (the area is a bit shady).  It's located in a somewhat questionable strip mall... and doesn't look like much from the outside, but have faith, brothers and sisters.  Lotus of Siam is the kind of foodie heaven we all dream about.  Can I get an amen?  Hallelujah.

I went with a large group.  Half hour wait.  The place was packed... and for good reason. \"How different can it be?\", you ask.  \"It's Thai food.\"  First... wash your mouth out with soap and we can have an adult discussion.  Let me know when you're ready.  I can wait.

Ok... we good?

I tried a lot (and it was all delicious), but no matter what you get... order this:

Pad Thai - 5/5
Garlic Prawns - 5/5   

Go.  Thou shalt be converted."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food that we have eaten. First time at this location, but still bomb! Best pad see eww we can find. Thanks lotus!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the new location! It's a lot fancier, there's a sign outside, and it's more roomier on the inside. Also, the waiting area is huge compared to the last location. I also recommend coming in for lunch as the wait was only about 20min, compared to dinner where I have waited a hour plus.

The food is consistently good, but I struggle on if the duck curry is worth the price. The portion isn't huge but can still be shared among two people. The other dishes like fried rice and noodles are more reasonably priced-still a little on the expensive side.

We ordered the duck curry spice level 7 and crab fried rice.

Duck curry had a great crispy skin and a good meat to skin ratio. The curry (panang) was beautifully spicy. Level 7 was perfect for our table.

Crab fried rice was okay. I could see the crab, but not really taste it. Also, parts of it looked like imitation crab as it had a vibrant red tint to it like imitation crab does. The large sliced tomatoes gave it an added layer that would've been missed without.

The service here was weirdly spotty at the time I came in. It was really good at the beginning and then when we ordered there was a lull. We waited about 15min for our food to arrive and afterwards the service stopped. We ended up grabbing our own waters because a server didn't stop by."}
{"text":"My friend is a really busy lady so when we go out, I usually try to find places near her home to minimize her commute.  We had planned to have dinner at Pin-Kaow and originally planned  to meet at 6 PM, then delayed to 630, and finally 7ish was decided upon.  She called to let me know that she got a lot of work done and has a lot of free time.  We started talking about Pin Kaow and find out she she's been there.  I like her to have new experiences, so I asked if she would be interested in trying out Lotus of Siam.  An enthusiastic \"yes\"...

It's been 5 years since I'd been here and called to see if reservations are needed.  I spoke with a guy named \"Bank\" who later I found out is the Manager.  He said they are booked and walk in's may need to wait 20 minutes.  I asked if they had a bar and he said that they do have a bar.  (that's new since I was last there)...I then asked if there was a \"walk in\" list.  He took my name and added my friend and we were good to go.  

Last time I was here a HUGE fight with around 15 people broke out in the parking lot.  The neighborhood is sketchy so have  your head on a swivel if you go.  When we arrived, there are what looks like patrons waiting outside for a table.  I was beginning to wonder how big the bar is.  We walk in and THEY EXPANDED!!!  They have a huge wine selection now!  Wow!  We announced our arrival and let them know we would be waiting in the Bar.  Everyone was very nice.  Zero, zip, nada attitude.  

We sat down, had ordered wine by that glass and were seated about 10 minutes later.  

I usually order the same foods regardless of which Thai establishment we go to so I asked Joe, our Waiter, for his recommendations.  We ordered the NAM KAO TOD Crispy rice appetizer that's mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice..  I'm big on hot dogs/sausage, so Joe offered it made with Tofu.  Excellent decision.  For our main course we ordered a Northern Thai dish called Northern Laub, which apparently is ompletely different from the Issan larb in taste, this northern style larb (ground pork) is cooked with Northern Thai spices and no lime juice, garnished with fresh herbs and vegetables.  I think I would have preferred to have this made with Tofu too but didn't want to upset the Chef with too many changes.  However, I think it would ahve been cool if it did.  They are very accommodating.  I've almost been kicked out for making a suggestion at a SF Chinatown spot. Anyway, an finally, La Piste de resistance,  Khao Soi.  This typical Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle is served in curry sauce and coconut cream (your choice of beef or chicken), garnished with sliced red onion, lime and pickled vegetables.  All of these dishes can be made with a spiciness range from 1-10.  We ordered a 7 for all and the smoke was perfect...I could have gone to an 8, but it was a perfect dish at 7.  Do NOT eat the little red peppers in the dish or have water ready.  Ice water.  Oh, we also ordered the Thai Tea.  Very refreshing.  They do not have coffee there.  Well, they do have instant, but is that really coffee, is it?

Oh man...the La Piste de resistance is really the sample platter dessert.  It's comprised of Coconut ice cream, Sticky rice with Mango's (if you like the salty sweet thing then this is your thing), and Fried banana rolls drizzled with honey.  Menu diva at it again...we were full so didn't want a Cheesecake Factory sized dessert.  Joe hooked up a sample Sampler for us.  The very sweet dessert maker delivered it for us and reaffirmed that it was made smaller for us.  It was sill plenty of food though.  ( I promised my friend I would not mention that she ate 75% of each plate, though she claims more of a 50 50 split.  Hey, I'm not mad at her. A gurl's gotta eat, right?)   

Our bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding.  We both ate good.

When I first moved here in 2001, I discovered Lotus of Siam listening to NPR.  The were saying how Gourmet Magazine chooses the top 10 restaurants in LV every year and every year, Lotus of Siam is selected.  How can one resist right?  The food was not awe inspiring, but I would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers either.  The food was 3 stars, the Service was 5 stars so I took an average of the two...(3+5)/2) is equal to 8/2 which equals 4...just in case...

Alrighty then!!!

Enjoy!

Chow!"}
{"text":"When you are a wine distributor,  there is no other place to take your clients. All sommeliers wants to go there and for a good reason, great service and great food.  Live this place."}
{"text":"For Thai food in Las Vegas this is really the only place to go.  Allow plenty of time on weekend at dinner time because there is sometimes an hour wait just for a table.  And when you get the food you can tell why.  The menu is very extensive.  I've eaten a lot of Thai food and this is honestly the best."}
{"text":"I was really tossed up between a four and five star rating but the food just goes above and beyond some of the other little negatives (location from the strip and the overall atmosphere, but both of these are minor). 

On to the food...as authentic as it gets. The crispy duck with drunken noodles was as another reviewer mentioned \"life-changing\". The flavor profiles that were going on throughout the course of the dish were AMAZING! The skin on the duck was just as good if not a notch better than The Peking Duck in Chinatown, NYC. (That's saying ALOT!)

We split a number of appetizers including the fried wontons, the spring rolls, and my favorite the prawns. A definite must try.

Not overly pricey at all and well worth a little jaunt to a less than desirable part of Las Vegas, but hey that's what gives this place it's edge."}
{"text":"What haven't LOS been yelped about??  Everything for the most part is true.  This place is, in street term, \"proper!\"  Yea, I'm hood like that.

I love watching the expression of my friends' faces when they take their first bite of the Braised Short Ribs with Panang.  Their eyes always light up, and to me that's enough because I'd like to think they're saying, \"Thank you.\"  

LOS knows how to do curry really well.  I still think it's kind of weird that their The Crispy Duck with Chu-Chee and Panang taste the same to me.  I tried them side by side too. Maybe my palate was inflamed from the heat of all the other dishes.  \"Shoot for a level 7 next time, Chowder.\"  It's still good though, but i would prefer the Braised short ribs over the ducks.

My latest craving is their Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  It's deep fried sea bass  top with chili and basil over a pan of fried flat noodles.  Very similar to Chinese Chow Fun. The sea bass is always fresh and hearty.  Heavenly! 

Portions here are a tad smaller, but you're getting more refined ingredients for what you're paying for.  

Verdict: Make reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"I went in with rocket-high expectations of the food here since it's reputed to be \"the best Thai food in N.America.\"   While the food was really good, I don't know that it necessarily lived up to its reputation, at least the night we were there.

Per the friendly waiter's recommendations, we had their \"signature\" deep-fried sour sausage appetizer, which was a unique starter.  It looks like deep-fried rice, actually, when it comes out, but apparently yes folks, that IS sausage.    Very strong flavors of sourness (from the lime juice?), hot chilis (spiciness can be to your requested level) and lots of other complex flavors all put into a very tasty combination.   

We moved onto their spicy beef, drunken seafood noodles, spicy seafood salad, and tom kah kai soup.

Spicy beef = 5 stars.   GREAT flavors, down to the lime juice - infused bed of cabbage that the beef is sitting on.

Drunken seafood noodles = 4 stars.  Good, but not life-changing.  Nice combination of lots of seafood (imitation crab, squid, shrimp, and ooh even a mussel was thrown in there!)

Spicy shrimp salad = 3.5 stars.  You can request the spiciness to the level of your comfort, and we asked for \"medium.\"   We found the dish to be flavorful, but a bit too salty and a bit too spicy for our tastes.  I felt overwhelmed by the dish after a couple bites and couldn't really eat much more.

Tom kha kai soup = 4.5 stars.  VERY well-balanced, complex, fresh flavors.

No room for dessert, though I was very tempted to get coconut ice cream just to put out the fire in my mouth and mellow out all the strong flavors I'd just ingested.

Definitely a good place to go if you like Thai food and/or strong / spicy flavors, but I don't know that it's the \"best Thai food in N. America.\""}
{"text":"I found it difficult to find this place, wish I had a GPS device at the time.  But it was well worth seeking out.  Thai dishes that I had never heard of before  I never knew that there was such a thing as Thai sausage!.  Each and every dish one was delicious.

I hope I have a chance to return here."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I'm not sure what I ordered since it took a while for me to write this but from what I do remember, the food was great! The garlic shrimp is a must have. It was deep fried and huge, like mini lobsters, and as good as the reviews said. The crispy duck was pretty damn good too. The three of us waited about half an hour to get seated. Only downside was our waiter, who forgot one of our orders and gave my wife an attitude when she couldn't make up her mind about what to order. But then again, we didn't go for the service; we went for the food.

PROS: Deep fried garlic shrimp, crispy duck

CONS: Waiter giving wife attitude, but whatevers. Garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST thai restaurant in the US, in my opinion.  I cannot come to Vegas and not take a detour to eat here.

First, MAKE a reservation and make sure you can get there slightly before your reservation as they will only hold your table for 5 minutes.  There is still always a wait.  Anticipate about a $16-$18 cab ride from the strip and about 15-20 minutes to get there depending on traffic.  Try to not go on a Friday or Saturday as it is always overly packed. 

Second, its not on the strip, it's in a mini mall in the middle of nowhere.  At first, you look at the outside and it looks like a place you are not sure you want to trust eating at, but trust me...you will thank me. 

They have a pretty high tech checkin system with an iPad and they actually have things organized when you get in.

Now for the food, when you get the menu go straight to the chef's specialties or the Northern selection.  It's what they specialize in so take advantage. 

They will ask you a scale of 1-10 for spiciness..the food is SPICY.  A 10 is only for those who have replaced their stomach with Iron.  A jalapeno is more at a level 2, a habernero is at a level 5...Scotch bonnets are level 8...I don't even know what they use.  Mind you the spice is there but so is the taste..its not like you burned your mouth and then nothing.

The wine list is also pretty impressive for a strip mall thai restaurant.  And well priced.  For $150, you can easily feed 4 people with a reasonably good bottle of wine too. 

Food Recommendation: Short Ribs in Penang Sauce"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for the past few years and for our 12th wedding anniversary, hubby and I decided to indulge for our celebratory trip. I can say that all of my expectations were met. 

Upon arrival, we parked in a packed parking lot in a very unassuming shopping center. The restaurant is nestled in amongst other businesses so if you were just driving by, you'd never expect a James beard restaurant to be there. 

We made reservations for 6pm on a holiday. So glad we did because when we arrived, the wait was about 10 people deep already. Highly recommend reservations!

We ordered the golden tofu and chicken satay as an app. Tofu was pillows of hot, fried goodness and the chicken satay was perfectly grilled and moist. Luckily the appetizers kept our tummies from screaming because the wait for our main dishes took much longer than I hoped (about 35 min).

The crispy duck curry was the main star of the meal even though they got the order wrong initially and sent us braised short ribs instead. Our server fixed the problem promptly. The northern larb was a second favorite. Pad see ewe was good, but nothing to write home about and their pineapple fried rice had more curry flavoring than I'd prefer. By the end of dinner, I was beyond stuffed and slightly disappointed that I didn't save room for dessert. 

Oh well, there's always next time."}
{"text":"This is the bomb when it comes to Thai food. Looks like a shanty strip mall  from the outside but opens up on the inside. Surprisingly most of the customers are Americans and hardly any asians.
The Garlic Shrimp is a must. Dont go there unless you gona order the garlic shrimp. Or else you deserve a punch in the face. Northern Thai cooking is their specialty and it is spicy. So if your a wuss about spicy food, then go to McDonalds on the same street and order a bic mac then kill yourself. If you want great spicy thai cooking then plant yourself in this place, save it on your bookmark and gps and enjoy... Now STFU, stop reading and freaking order, NOW!!!!!!"}

Comments: This has one of the most extensive and authentic Thai menus I've seen in the US beating out many places in California by a long shot. Menu is perhaps too extensive, but everything at our table was fantastic. Notable recommendations would be the soft shell crab pad kee mao (drunken noodles), the crispy garlic prawns appetizer (fried shrimp shells are edible and yummy), nam khao tod (a Lao dish with sour pork and crispy rice). There are curries, massaman, Lao dishes, Issan province dishes, and more. Wine selection focuses on Riesling, which range from $20-65 per bottle."}
{"text":"James Beard award winner of 2011! This place has a ton of wine and they do take reservations! You can also get an estimate wait time off their website (thank you!). The interior was larger than I expected it to be. It is located in a plaza off the strip.I was told this was deemed the best Thai food in the entire nation and that Anthony Bourdain recommended not getting Pad Thai here. This place is known for their northern Thai dishes so I made sure to try many of those. I tried:

1. pad see ew 
2. drunken noodles
3. salty Thai lemonade 
4. Northern larb (ground pork with lime juice)
5. panang curry (delicious!)
6. nam prik noom (green chili dip)- super spicy, this was our least favorite dish. It was just a dip with a side of vegetables to dip into the green spicy sauce
7. crab fried rice (the best I've ever had!)
8. nua nam tok - sliced beef with lime juice 
9. prawns with super spicy green chili lime sauce on a bed of cabbage - this dish was way too sour for me but my friends loved it 

They charge for their regular rice but I didn't mind because their rice was delicious! It was gluttonous and soft. I could eat rice and curry all day. Serving sizes here are small so I would recommend ordering 1-2 dishes more than the number of heads in your party. Mango isn't in season right now so we didn't get to try the mango sticky rice dessert. Everything was super spicy despite being described as a 4 out of 10. Our meal ended up being around $25-28 per person."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam lived up to the hype. Went to the back of the menu and ordered from Northern Specialties. Got the curried egg noodle dish. Also the thai sausage. Sausage was a little dry, but still very tastey. Flavors are vibrant. The spice really hits you. Also got the basil fried rice which was excellent."}
{"text":"Another great night with the fam and a meal with garlic prawns, chilean sea bass, pad thai, fried chicken wings. Would recommend to get a different sauce for the wings and the sea bass."}
{"text":"A friend of ours recommended this place when in Las Vegas, so we waited in line before the opening.  OMG this place is great.  And for someone who loves great wine, these guys have THE list of great German wines.  It seemed that they don't normally have that many who are interested in the big book of wines but we're happy to assist those who do.  I was in heaven.  They just kept bringing food until I said stop.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service wasn't. The waiters were great (attentive), but we were rushed the entire time. They asked us at least 5 times if we were ready to order, (if we were ready our menus would have been shut), and then about 5-10 minutes after finishing the check we were asked to leave because \"guests were waiting.\" I'm sorry but we had a reservation for over two months for this restaurant. The least you can do for a PAYING and polite customer is to allow them to sit and relax or at least digest, or you know, put the receipt away, before asking them to leave. Also, the \"manager\" who asked us to leave did not do it in a proper manner. It was \"we have guests, you're going to need to leave.\" I don't go to a restaurant to feel rushed and hurried, absolutely unacceptable. Will not be returning. A true shame because the food was very good."}
{"text":"Solid Thai restaurant but totally overrated by the press.  There are other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas for the same price that are just as good.  You will definitely need a reservation for this place.  

I've been here about 3 times now.  All the noodle dishes are excellent.  Soups are just ok -- nothing to write home about.  They have a huge menu, so there are definitely a lot of dishes that I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after all the hype. Too sour: crispy rice. Very weird: garlic prawns. No vegetables in panang curry."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 10, it is THAT GOOD!!  So much to choose from so definitely recommend exploring and eating stuff you might not order at your local Thai place; assuming you live out of the area like me... I had a spicy braised beef dish that was sublime.. This is a must stop right off the strip on Sahara.. I plan on returning many more times.."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall that is very easy to pass over because its so sketchy looking, Lotus of Siam is a very pleasant surprise within. 

They have many plates that would appeal to all types, from the adventurous eater to the safe nibbler. Most dishes are definite winners, but word to wise, don't underestimate the spice level. Our table definitely got a swift kick to the mouth with the papaya salad. But our other starters were pretty delicious in my opinion. The deep fried shrimp is what they are known for. The shrimp is succulent and juicy, but I wasn't really a fan of the pieces that were just deep fried pieces of shrimp shell. We also tried the crispy rice. 75% of our table weren't fans, but I thought it was definitely bold on flavor. It was different and I have to admit, I actually enjoyed it and was happy to have not ordered run of the mill chicken wings.

For our entrees, we tried a variety of Thai fusion and authentic Thai. The garlic pepper scallops were very delicious. The scallops had a nice crust, but were also buttery and smooth. But my piece had a little grit to it, so I'm hoping it was pepper and not sand. The sauce was also an excellent topper for rice. Next up was the mint leaf duck which I found  equally tasty. Again, it was bold on the flavor and was not a winner at the table....but I liked it. The duck was a little gamey, but was balanced nicely by the refreshing mint and sweet peppers. Lastly, we tried the massaman curry which can be compared to a red curry with a kick to it - one that kind of reminded me of the flavor of Tom Yum soup.  

They have a great collection of wine to pair with their meal as well.

All in all an interesting experience."}
{"text":"The service was awesome; very fast, helpful, cheerful, and polite! And the food was absolutely delicious. I visited this place twice during one visit to Vegas bc I couldnt get enough of it :) My favorite was the Drunken Sea Bass, Red Curry, pork larb, and the mint duck... all reasonably priced. I know thai food and this is it, yum."}
{"text":"Last night is my second times with Lotus of Siam.  All delicious really.  The owner is wonderful lady, she is very polite and nice to everyone.  I intend to visit every times when I will hve times to visit Las Vegas and introduce to all my friend who want to visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is the best place in Vegas.  Went there because it was on \"Best thing I ever ate\" on food network.  Was actually disappointed with the dish featured on the show, but everything else was wonderful."}
{"text":"I recently (the past 2 years) have gotten into Thai food and I love it. This place came recommended to me by a friend who is originally from Okinawa and knows good Asian fare. 

First off let me say that it is in a strip mall that you would not ever go to unless you were going here. If you think to yourself on the way that \"this cannot possibly be the place\" then you are headed in the right direction. The good news is once you get there it's a totally different scene on the inside. Deceptively large and always busy, this place sports a really fine wine selection and some of the best Thai cuisine on the planet.

My friends who live in LV and have been to Thailand several times say it is the real deal for authentic and the menu is almost overwhelming with original Thai dishes. 

So for starters the Thom Ka is excellent, 1-10 spice scale and it comes in a hot pot with the flame going strong as it delivered to the table. It is certainly enough to share but of course you have to agree on the spice level. 

I am curry junkie so that's the route I usually go, and the Panang is my flavor of choice, no matter the meat I have not been disappointed ever with the quality. I have had Chicken and Shrimp Panang and both were excellent.

On one trip to Lotus we had a hard core vegan among us, this was no problem at all and they made everything to order just the way she wanted it and got really creative and used veggies and fruits that none of us besides her had ever heard of. 

I am always amazed at the shear volume of people coming through this place. On the weekend you cannot get in, they do take reservations but they normally don't answer the phone, as it is so busy so go during the week and expect a wait even then or eat later that seems to work too.

So go here and get anything you want, I would recommend this place for those new to Thai and veterans alike as everyone can get something they will love."}
{"text":"We experienced a hugely overrated large Thai Restaurant with a simple and airy atmosphere. The food I ordered was cooked \"Thai Street Food\" style. I know this, actually having lived almost a year in Bangkok, Thailand. Not only did our waiter lie to us about the our order, but charged us a dollar more than the menu price without warning. It was not even a holiday. My glass was dirty, almost an hour to be seated, and a long wait time for an order of (obviously  cooked pre-order) \"Thai BBQ Chicken\". The off-flavor Papaya Salad was a (time and labor saving) stick cut (julienne) instead of Shredding the Papaya! ...and it was the tiniest papaya Salad that I ever saw. The soup, Yen-ta-fo, was missing essential items, including meat and fish balls. A big bowl of noodles with two shrimp and a few small bits of meat and a cheaper vegetable replacement. A real rip-off."}
{"text":"I ate here with 3 dining companions a couple of weeks ago for my 30th
birthday.  We were initially going to go to Komol but were swayed by
the concierge at the taxi stand after he told us that Lotus of Siam
was world famous.  I still am not sure of that distinction but there
were pictures of famous people including Mario Batali all around the
restaurant with a lady whom I assume is the owner.

We decided to start off our meals with both the Moo Dad Dea (Pork
Jerky Thai Style) and Golden Tofu.  The tofu was fried perfectly which
gave it a good texture on the outside that almost made it al dente.
It's sweet and sour sauce was nice as well giving the tofu a great
overall flavor.  The pork jerky was an interesting dish but also good.
  For some reason it reminded me of some fried pork belly that I had
enjoyed previously and it was quickly gone between the three meat
eaters at the table.  For my entree I asked the server what the most
popular dishes in the restaurant were.  He mentioned the crispy duck
and something else but since I already had been looking at the duck, I
ended up ordering that.  Whenever I was asked how spicy I wanted it on
scale of 1 to 10, I replied \"Thai Spicy\".  You see in Pittsburgh, Thai
spicy is somewhere around a 15 or 20 on that scale.  However the
waiter said that their Thai spicy was a 7 and I ended up asking him
for a 10 instead.  Since I love spicy food it was not necessarily a
mistake but I did have tears in my eyes during most of the meal.  I
also had two other dining companions that could not finish their meals
due to the spice level with one of those dishes only being a 5.  So I
would have to recommend that you are careful in the spice level that
you order here.  Anyways, my crispy duck ended up tasting good, at
least what I could taste of it beyond the heat.  It was not at all
greasy and had some crunch whenever I bit into it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in
the future.  I really enjoyed their food and also noticed some other
interesting looking dishes on their menu that I would like to try
whenever my mouth wasn't on fire."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and this time around no wait! We were very happy because we did not have to wait. We ordered the beef jerky for an appetizer, the crispy duck panang, and rad na. The beef jerky was a lil chewy for my liking but it had great flavor especially the sauce it came with. For the main entrees, we ordered the crispy duck panang which was pretty amazing! Def will order that again. The rad na was okay. I wasn't a fan of the gravy. Will def go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great food - what a pleasure to leave the strip for a breath of fresh air and QAULITY food.  Highly recommend and feel this a place for anyone.  Had some terrific soup here."}
{"text":"This little gem is a great discovery. It might look a little shady from the outside but it's great inside. Delicious food and solid service. The drinks were great as well. Tons of wine variety"}
{"text":"Really good thai food!
However, the wait took forever!
I've eaten pretty much majority of the popular items in the menu but today, I only ordered two. 

I personally like the nam kao tod and drunken noodle soft shell crab the most. 

Nam Kao Tod:
I love how it is sour and salty. To me, this is like eating takis but a little healthier and fulfilling. 

Drunken noodle:
The noodle are soft, mushy and chewy. They use thick flat noodles that is clear/white; idk what they are but thats my best description. 

Pad thai:
Pad thai here is different from others. The pad thai is actually sweet. 


All food have spicy range from 1-10. 

Thai tea is the best here but it's like $5... LOL"}
{"text":"The first time I sat here wasn't the best and it's been two years since. We came back recently because our friend really likes this place. 
The second time was much better. 
Since he recommended to us about dishes he already knew it was easier to order. I don't think our waiter did a great job with that neither of the times. 

We got some sort of crispy rice which was outstanding. Also egg rolls which were not, very basic but still tasty. 

For main dishes we got the crispy duck and thick cut noodles with broccoli and beef. Both were very tasty. Another friend got sea bass with papaya salad. He was surprised when he got it... he didn't understand the description too well and the waiter didn't go thru the fact that it was a hot fish on top of a cold spicy salad. It wasn't as good as the other dishes. 

I will be coming back but would like to get better service and for the menu to be easier to understand..."}
{"text":"nam prik noom, kang hung lay,? thum ka noon - jack fruit salad, northern larb, khao soi,  only order the northern thai."}
{"text":"Waiting is worth it. Food, wine, atmosphere, THE BOMB!

Highly recommend if you are in Vegas and want best food, best price.

Not far off the strip, maybe a $12 cab ride from Wynn.

Wine cellar is HUGE."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Everything was great! I wish they'd open up one in Los Angeles! High quality."}
{"text":"Our wait was an hour long. I couldn't remember waiting that long the first time I was here a few years ago. The restaurant had even just about doubled in size since then too! Though the wait was a bit long, my taste bud experience was well worth the wait. The food was phenomenal. Every dish was very flavorful and the food tasted more authentic than other Thai restaurants. 

The location it's in is kind of shabby looking. Don't judge a book by its cover though; this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Someone told me this was the \"best Thai food outside of Thailand\".  With that kind of a  claim, I had to try it out.  I was in Vegas for a conference, so I made it a point to get over to Lotus and punched the address into the GPS. 

We got there around 4pm, it was located off the strip.  When we got there, I was thinking \"this is it?\".  It was a HUGE, deserted strip mall, with a very empty parking lot.  All of the store fronts were plain and faded, definitely wasn't feeling very Vegas here.

You can't see into the restaurant, so we opened the door apprehensively and poked our heads in.  First thing you noticed is every square inch on their walls is covered with photos of celebrities eating there. The restaurant is pretty big, but was more or less empty when we sat down to order.

Admittedly, we didn't make the best selections in terms of gauging the true authenticity.  I had Curry Duck, my friend had Curry Tofu and my other friend had BBQ Chicken.  My 2 friends had never had Thai food before, so I sort of held back.  Had I gone with more experienced Thai food eaters, I probably would have ordered several dishes to eat family style.  But I didn't want to risk it with them, since the prices are a little higher and we couldn't take anything back to the conference with us.

However, the food was still great and both of my friends couldn't stop talking about how good it was, and how they had to bring their wives the next time.  My friend that ordered the chicken was stoked, since his order was huge, practically an entire chicken.

When we looked up from our meals, the restaurant, was packed!  Not a table in the house was available.  On our way out, I looked on some of the other tables and some of the seafood dishes I saw looked amazing.  I will definitely be returning here and next time, plan on trying many more, unique dishes.

NOTE: can't remember if it was Andrew Zimmern or Anthony Bourdain, but saw on TV that one of them went here and said the Northern dishes are their specialties, and to just order those."}
{"text":"So so so good. Went here with some girlfriends from work while we were attending a conference. Very happy we found this gem through yelp.

We had the Tom Kah Kai (literally I could like the bowl), garlic prawns, Chicken satay, and crispy duck.

My friends went here AGAIN the next night because it was just that good! I will definitely return my Next time in Vegas.

To note: they do not take same day reservations. We went on a Tuesday night and there was a small wait- so keep that in mind. It took about 15 mins to get there from the strip. Price point was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Asian cuisine but I took a chance on this place. Even if your not a big Asian fan try this out. The big surprise is the variety and the price is good. You need reservations or you just won't get in."}
{"text":"Anyone who gave this place less than 5 stars is an IDIOT. If you are in Vegas and you don't come here YOU are an idiot. BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD. Do yourself a favor, don't be an idiot and make a reservation for this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a tough one, but its a solid 3.2 Stars (note I rate Din Tai Fung as 3.5 for reference).  3.2 = Solid, happy to come back.

They do take reservations and it is a must unless you want to wait a long while.

This place is called a \"Las Vegas Classic.\"  So hyped.  And as always, it is always hard to meet the hype and it fails a tad here at Lotus of Siam.  Why?  Mainly because the dishes seemed rushed out and you can taste a lack of that sweet care from the chef.  Understandable though because they need to turn tables as fast as possible due to such high demand.

So many famous people have come here, yes, its one of those places as you enter you see all the pictures on the wall of who's who that's has dined here.  The wine selection is stellar as you see it the moment you hit the dining room.  The Service is great, the hostesses are pleasant.  Now to the food.

Papaya Salad - Solid.  The spice associated with the salad was mouthwatering.  This is a dish to order always as it starts it all off perfectly.  It is clean, light, fresh, prepares you for the rest of dinner.

Khao Soy (Crispy Duck, Egg Noodle) - Now this dish is quite stellar.  It is the Northern Thai variant of Khao Soy.  The duck is crispy, but not like the garlic shrimp, more like a crispy, breaded type.  It is succulent, tender, just perfect.  Egg Noodles are perfect and the yellow coconut curry goes all perfectly together.  This is one of those dishes I can have 2-3x a week and I look forward to most when coming here.

Crispy Garlic Shrimp - The hypness hits a roadblock here.  The most famous dish here.  You expect it to be jaw dropping, mouth watering.  It isn't.  The skin is perfectly done to a crisp (you eat it), and the shrimp are of a good size (see picture).  For what most everyone raves about here, I will say it is good, it is tasty, but the star of the restaurant?  Only for people who are novels to it.  Would I order it again?  Yes.  But I would tell my table its one of the entrees that are good here, not the, \"OMG WE HAVE TO ORDER THISSSSSS.\"

Panang -  Decent.  Nothing to write home about.

Green Curry - Forgettable.  Wait, we had green curry?

Sea Bass -  Totally overpriced and small portion.  Skip this.  Nuff said.  This dish is almost a whole Star doc worthy.

Fried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream Dessert - Delicious.  Small chunks of banana fried in an egg roll style.  The delicate thin crispiness was very well appreciated by my mouth.  The coconut ice cream was light and heavenly.  Must Order Dish.

Vibe - Great.  The whole place is hummin along, happy, eatin, drinkin, laughing.  It is like all my Thai friends.  

The menu here is huge.  North and South.  Most of the good dishes seem to come from Northern menu.  We enjoyed it here but like I said, the dishes seemed rushed, but for understandable reasons.  Glad to have tried it.  Come back on next Vegas trip?  Probably not (mainly because Vegas has so many options).  

But damn that Khao Soy callin my name......"}
{"text":"I had somewhat of mixed expectations of this restaurant as several friends/colleagues have raved about their dishes, namely the garlic prawns (fried version) and the duck panang; and others have not enjoyed it.

My SO made reservations here for 7:30 PM, which I'm glad we did, because we were seated immediately. There were groups of folks waiting by the door, and I overheard the host tell a party that the wait would be at least an hour and 30. yikes.

At the servers recommendation, we ordered the Tom Kha soup (he asked how spicy we wanted it on a scale from 1-10). The soup was okay- we ended up mostly pouring it over the white rice.

We also ordered the fried garlic prawns-- right below this dish on the menu, there is a fried garlic prawns with drunken noodles- and that is not the same thing. The server said they use different seasoning for the prawns. I was disappointed by this dish, as I felt it salty and underwhelming. We ended up eating only a couple pieces.

I was deciding between the poached salmon and sea bass- server highly recommended the sea bass so I ordered it with the ginger sauce. The steamed sea bass was very buttery and so good! I would definitely re-order this dish if I come back.

Although I did not enjoy their most popular dish, I would come back to order other dishes and the sea bass. The entrees came out rather quickly (less than 10 minutes) and the service was great."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a family member and on my last day in Vegas I was craving Thai food so I decided to check it out. 

Our party of 4 (me, my parents and my uncle) had to wait about an hour for a table around 1pm for lunch. When we were seated it took about 15 more minutes to get someone to interact with us and take our order and another 10 or so minutes for water to be served.

Finally, after a total of about an hour and a half out appetizers were served, which were delicious, fresh, super flavorful and (almost) made us forget about the wait.

The papaya salad was fresh and delicious with a spicy sweet flavor. The larb salad with minced pork was also good, but maybe a tad bit salty for me. We also decided to try the pork 'Thai jerky' which was yummy when dipped in the house-made sauce. Rounding everything out was a hefty shrimp salad - nice and spicy with a well rounded flavor overall.

Once we cleared our plates there was another lull before one of our entrees appeared - a shredded jackfruit and pork dish. It was served without the promised side of rice and after waiting about 10 minutes with nothing else coming with finished it and waiting for the rest of our food. 

After another 10 minutes or so our other three entrees were served. I got the northern Thai dish Khao Soi noodles with chicken which was nice, mild and sweet. One note here - when asked how spicy I wanted it I said \"medium\" so for you spice grinds out there I recommend you ask high.

My uncle got the Hor Mok Chilean Sea Bass which was a yummy steamed sea bass and egg dish mixed with cabbage, coconut milk and curry sauce. It came in a cast iron and was beautifully presented as 7 mini dishes. 

Our last entree was another jackfruit dish, the Kang Ka Noon. My dad was slightly disappointed with the texture - it was more watery than we would have liked but the flavor of the jackfruit and curry were undoubtedly delicious. 

We were stuffed by the end of our meal but wanted to cleanse our palates with some coconut ice cream. I usually find these ice creams bland and boring but this tasted fresh and delicious while also super creamy. 

Overall, the wait and service here leaves something to be desired but if you have the time the food is quite good and you can find some unique dishes that are not available at many other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Duck curry & Fried prawn was excellent. Pad thai was not very good at all. Avoid that order. Service & restaurant is ok. It could be better but its Vegas."}
{"text":"They're still #1.

If you haven't eaten at Lotus of Siam, you've been asleep at the wheel. If you have, you've likely enjoyed traditional Thai food and Northern Thai specialties by James Beard Award winner Chef Saipin Chutima. Their old location was featured on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown, this new one was recently on Food Paradise on the Travel Channel, and the name is evidently known to a plethora of chefs and celebrities from Hollywood and other realms.

Their move to a new location, made necessary by a disastrous roof collapse, allowed them to take over the old Roy's on Flamingo near Paradise and to create a modern dining room that is brighter, more inviting, and seemingly if not actually bigger. Lack of nostalgic charm aside, this was a superior dining environment compared to the historical artifact in that old rundown plaza. The waiting anteroom was quite comfortable too, and we didn't have to spend more than 10-15 minutes there despite arriving shortly before Sunday night's opening hours without a reservation.

All of this would be irrelevant if the food wasn't as good. Thankfully, our fears were allayed with every dish we tasted. Surprisingly, one item was even far better than I'd remembered it from before.

Tom Kah Kai ($15.95): the first thing you'll see is an impressive hot pot-like presentation with a flame spewing forth from the center of a metal vessel. After the server has finished ladling the soup into bowls for you, then you'll taste an impressive balance of creamy coconut milk and the traditionally sour, lemongrassy soup in what you might call the Tom Yum \"base.\" The white meat chicken is just chicken, but it soaks up all of the flavors.

Spicy Chicken Wings ($10.95): crispy wings with a mild, sweet chili garlic sauce and crispy fried basil leaves. Simple and well-executed.

Nam Kao Tod ($10.95): this sour crispy rice dish was not my favorite before, but it felt as if the sourness had been tamed this time. Moreover, the crispy rice was perfectly crispy down to each single grain. An old dish but certainly a new favorite of mine.

Catfish Nam Tok ($16.95): sourness rules the day again here, with a delightful, fresh salad featuring green onions, red onions, and fragrant leaves including cilantro. Moist chunks of catfish serve as the protein of this cold dish rather than something like beef (Nua Nam Tok).

Pad Se-Ew ($12.95) w/ sliced beef: one of the very common Thai noodle dishes, and not normally one which I'd consider ordering. However, at least one person at our table wanted it, and I'm sure the rest of us were curious. Simply put, it was as delicious as any Pad Se-Ew I've had, so the only reason you'd wait to get it elsewhere is simply that it's more expensive here.

Khao Soi ($12.95) w/ sliced beef: an old favorite that is still quite impressive. It can be described simply as curry egg noodle soup, but the dish is more complex than that. Don't expect as much coconut milk flavor as in other curries though; the Northern Thai specialities such as this don't tend to use that ingredient as much if at all. Do expect a treat from start to finish.

Crispy Duck Panang ($28.95): the last dish which I ate tonight, and perhaps the best. The duck has a Chinese-inspired spice profile, and it surprisingly kept that crispy texture despite being slathered with the most brilliant curry of your dreams (other than Stephen). Grab some white rice and get that curry sauce on it, then proceed your dazzle your taste buds.

Lotus of Siam remains at the top of my list for Thai food if money is no object. That said, keep this in mind: you're not coming here for the everyday stuff which you'll find at a hole in the wall because there are multiple delicious, cheap Thai joints in this city (and possibly some where you're from, if you're not a local). You're coming here for premium dishes and regional specialities not on other menus. And even after ordering several interesting dishes, we escaped with a $30 per person split (including taxes/tip) by only splurging on food and not alcohol."}
{"text":"Great Thai . Had the signature jumbo garlic prawns which were absolutely BOMB! 
Also we had this sliced beef dish , tender and flavorful.
Good wine
Seafood soup was amazing !
Great tasting noodles with chicken & shrimp .
I only wish they didn't forget to put our rice and hard noodles in our to go bag. That was a major bummer ."}
{"text":"Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.

I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.

The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce

After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.

I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.

Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying."}
{"text":"Looks nothing on the outside what it is on the inside. Beautiful, large, clean and bright restaurant. I was really surprised!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I have ever eaten hands down. It's in an older strip mall off of Sahara, but don't let that fool you. The food here is amazing. Our group devoured the following items from the menu: Tom Kah Kai Soup, Beef and Chicken Patay, Crispy Duck Panang, Thai Fried Rice, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Thai, and another dish with chicken and green beans.  We dined here for an early lunch (on a Tuesday). That was a smart move to avoid the crowds. The service was impeccable, the food had lots of flavor and we enjoyed the pictures of celebs on the wall. You know the food is good when there are no leftovers! Great first impression Lotus of Siam! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet and my husband ordered off the menu today.  The buffet was just ok...2 soups (the beef noodle was tasty), egg rolls, chicken curry, pad thai, white & fried rice, salad, fruit, and a few more items.  My husband had a delicious soup (don't remember the name), a shrimp appetizer wrapped in bacon and wanton that was good, and for entree - drunken noodles with sea bass.  I would suggest ordering off the menu as the buffet was definately not representative of the excellence of the food.  

I must say though, Amarind's in Chicago is even more delicious...at a similar price point."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it continues to be wonderful with my favorite wine list in the country."}
{"text":"Thai food heaven.  

I came here on a Thursday night around 8pm with no reservations (stupid me), but for 2, we only waited 30 minutes,  which isn't bad at all.  There were many people getting out of cabs and people were walking so fast into Lotus,  like a competition.  

Now onto the food:
I heard so many great things about this place and wanted to keep my expectations low,  just so I don't hype myself out.  But.. the food was to die for. The crispy duck with penang sauce was really good: the outer crispiness with the tenderness of the duck.

I got a curry dish,  and it was perfectly seasoned. I used it as dipping sauce as well as for other items besides rice. 

The sea bass over drunken noodles was also very tasty. 

I wish they had this in los angeles, going to vegas for Thai food is too much of a commute!"}
{"text":"This where I bring all my out of town guests as well where I come to splurge on Lobster and Duck dishes

This place is missing a VALET and that's all, everything is else is on point."}
{"text":"One word- HYPE. OVERPRICED and SMALL PORTIONS. Came in and saw there was a lunch buffet, but nothing piqued my interest so decided to opt for the order-menu for lunch. 
Tried the:
1) Rad na ~$10
2) Panang Curry (beef)  - ~11

Was not impressed at all. It was good, but not THAT good. The portion of the panang curry was on the stingy side ( less than 1 cup) and the rad na was not very memorable. Overpriced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food I have ever had in my entire life hands down. Please resist the temptation to order the usuals like pad Thai. I am sure it is delicious but you are really selling yourself short and avoiding the true gems on their menu. 

Garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns!! Did I also tell you to get their garlic prawns? They separate out the shell and then delicately deep-fry them both to perfection if deep-fried is a delicate technique at all. I have eaten at multiple places in Las Vegas but from this point on this is the one restaurant I will always be coming back to every time I visit the city. Also you have to get their duck curry the khao soi. Admittedly on my first bite of the curry while it was flavorful with the usual creaminess of a coconut-based curry, I did not know what the hype was. And then I took a bite of the duck and my whole world changed. Then i had the curry again and it completed  the entire picture. everyone tells you to get this on the menu and it definitely did not disappoint. I feel like these are items you cannot just find in any restaurant and this place does them extremely well. This is easily worth the trip not only for the quality of the food but because if you are going to be staying on the strip anyway you'll pay just as much for overpriced food and be missing out on authentic Thai land cuisine this place offers. Easy 5 stars in my books.

Note, you can make get on their wait list online!"}
{"text":"Cuisine magazine was right when they rated Lotus of Siam as the Best Thai Cuisine in North America!  Best oustide of Siam!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever eaten! No complaints."}
{"text":"3.6 stars

With 1000+ reviews and all the hype, I was expecting something a little more out of the ordinary.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't like \"OMG it's so good\" either. Since this was my first time trying the place, I think I need to make at least a 2nd trip back to try the other dishes in order to make a better judgment. Those garlic prawns that seem to be getting so much attention sure sound and look very good. We had the soft shell crab over drunken noodle, pad thai, green curry, and tom yum soup. Pretty much the staples of Thai cuisine. The dishes were flavorful, but not the best.  Being from LA, I must say we are spoiled with plenty of good Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"one the best thai joints out there; crispy rice is a must try. and there's a dish with raw fresh shrimp with a really tasty spicy sauce.  very creative and very good."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler to Thailand and Thai food have a special place in my heart, I was extremely disappointed. 

I had high hopes for Lotus of Siam. This is the first time I tried it even though I've raved about this place to families and friends for the longest time because of reviews and tv shows. The first time we went here, the line was too long so we ate down the plaza at another amazing Thai restaurant called Arawan. It was delicious and everybody said the food was good. Not one bad dish. 

I stopped by here last night because my sister in law wanted Asian food. Somewhere not on the strip because American can't do Asian food right. It's also much more expensive than off the strip. We came 30 minutes before closing. Maybe that's why the food wasn't up to standard but that's no excuse. If you're open, you provide consistent quality of food throughout the day. 

Our server was great and attentive. Recommend us to try the Penang Curry. 

Food:

- Papaya Salad
- Tom Yum with Chicken 
- Panang Curry with Chicken 
- Beer Liver 
- Pad Thai

Tom Yum was extremely sour. Too much lemongrass and no balance of flavor. Worst Tom Yum I've ever had. This was the starter and I was already felt disappointed. 

Papaya Salad was okay. Not enough fish sauce, lime, and chili. It was a bit plain in tasting. Should be a bit more overpowering of fish sauce and chili. That's how I like the papaya salads in Thailand. 

Panang Curry with Chicken was the best dish. It was well balance in flavor and a nice little kick of heat. Not too much coconut sauce which some places that makes it a bit too creamy. Eat this with white rice and it was great. 

Beef Liver. My brother got this and I wouldn't recommend it. The sauce is a bit too sour and the Liver is gamey. 

Pad Thai was okay also. Nothing too great this dish that stands out. At least it's not sour or too much sauce like some other places. But it was ok considering the other dishes wasn't spectacular. 

One of the female waiter came to pick up our tab and open to check the amount in there which is weird. One of the dollar had some purple stuff on it. It was part of the tip and none of us had another dollar to change it to. She gave us a weird look and I'm just thinking, it's part of your tip. You don't have to take it if you don't  want. 

I like that this place serve Northern Thai food which I like and there's a lot of dishes I want to try. I will give this place another go when I'm in Vegas and see if this was an off night."}
{"text":"I've always heard about how good Lotus of Siam was and wanted to come here for awhile.  I was usually deterred because I never really frequent the area it is in and I heard the wait to get a table there can be atrociously long (my friend once was told a 2 hour wait for a table of 5).  I even tried calling to make reservations a few different times and each time they were booked solid days in advance.  I finally buckled down and mentally prepared myself for a long wait.  The area it is located in isn't the nicest part of town and the outside of the restaurant is really unassuming.  I'm pretty sure there were a few people turning tricks in or near the parking lot but anyways...when my friend and I arrived at around 6 pm on a Saturday night we were both so surprised to be seated right away!  

The inside of the restaurant is clean and actually quite large and nicely decorated with a large wine cellar you can look into through the glass walls. The service was friendly and helpful when giving recommendations too.   

What we ordered:
-Crispy Duck with the Panang Curry ($27.95) - Not going to lie when I saw the price of this dish I was a little thrown off by it, I guess it's because I'm so used to cheap prices for other Thai dishes at other places.  I ended up biting the bullet and ordering anyways and I'm glad I did!  The curry had a nice kick to it (you can modify spicy level of your dish on a scale of 1-10) very flavorful, but the main star of the dish was the duck.  The duck had a nice crispy skin on the top and the meat was nice and juicy.  My friend I was with never had duck before and tried it and he really enjoyed it to.
-Yellow Curry with Chicken ($10.95) - I honestly was so enamored with my crispy duck that I didn't have any of my friend's yellow curry.  He said it was good though and enjoyed it. 

I will definitely be back to try their other dishes, I'll probably make a reservation way in advance to avoid my wait time anxiety though."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in these great United States!

I've lived everywhere...and I would take a flight to Vegas for Lotus of Siam...and not the slots :)

Go for dinner...its packed...virbrant...and the food is world-class!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We went there Sunday night for appetizers at friend's company dinner, and they were outstanding! 

It was so good that I made reservations for Wednesday night.

Four of us ordered a boatload of great things. The soups are amazing! The chef specials at the back of the menu you are the \"go to place\" for great food. 

The only thing I suggest, is to ask them to space the food out. All of our food came at once. Soups, appetizers, and main courses. So if they space the dishes out, you would get to enjoy every delicious morsel at a great pace.  Trust me, try them out!"}
{"text":"Hard to catch a cab ride back but soooooooo worth it! Crispy Duke Panang a must and the Garlic Shrimp is crispy and sautéed perfectly with Thai chillies and minced garlic. Safe to say the best Thai food I've ever had. Sorry Mom!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I've now come to this restaurant three times and its been hit or miss.  Sometimes I have a great meal and sometimes it's a mediocre meal at best.  

Some dishes that stick out in my mind:

Soups: I've had a few different soups, but they've all been really good.  When they ask you how hot you'd like it, from a scale of 1-10, they aren't messing around.  I had the 3 and was really feeeling the heat.  Don't take the heat for granted.

Crispy Sea Bass and Drunken Noodles: Waaaaay overpriced.  For $23, you'd expect a lot more.  What you get are a few small crispy fillets on top of a square chunk of chow fun noodles.  Nothing special for $23.

Garlic Prawns: I think these were around $20.  What I really like about these is that the skin is mostly peeled off and attached just at the base and they deep fry the whole thing.  The flavors are great and I highly recommend the dish...albeit a bit overpriced.  

They also have an extremely impressive wine list with like 7 pages of rieslings.

I feel like the food here is good, but I'm not sure if it's anything truly spectacular that everyone has made it out to be."}
{"text":"So I decided to brave Lotus of Siam again, and admit that it's winning me over.

The crispy garlic prawns were a step down though; not very garlicky at all and I think the batter wasn't fully cooked.

You can totally eat the shells, but I'd still stay away from the tails, which have a tendency to poke you in your mouth. Ouch!

The nam prik ong was pretty fucking awesome. No wonder why it was featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" The cool veggies (carrots, cauliflower, cucumber, string beans) offset the heat of in the spicy pork dip (my medium was plenty spicy).

But nothing is better than dipping pork rinds in pork. I mean, it's all the same animal, so it's meant to be.

My Thai friend Amy ordered an incredible crispy duck dish during our previous visit, and I was trying my damndest to remember the name. Oh well, next time.

The parking lot still sketches me out though. There were a few ambulances there when I went ... God knows what ... or who ... went down at the neighboring brothel and bathhouse."}
{"text":"I tried the Drunken noodles with prawns.  The prawns were big and juicy.  It was delicious!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week and it was packed. Was seated after 10 minutes in the newer dinning room with the bar.

I ordered the beef combo soup since I opted out of the AYCE buffet for $10.99 The soup took half an hour to receive after ordering and was disappointing. I ordered 4 on the spice level and the taste was flat and the temperature was lukewarm. In addition, the menu stated it contained flat noodles which wasn't served and the portion was small. For the price they charge, the soup wasn't worth $8.95

I would avoid Lotus of Siam for lunch in the future, it's just too busy and not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I had heard, well actually read, so much about how amazing this place was. When a restaurant is heralded as the best Thai food in North America, it has to be good. Only down side was my expectations going in were sky high. However it really says something when not only was I not let down but my expectations were actually exceeded. 
I've heard that everything on the menu is great and so far that's true although some things are a bit more amazing than others. I've been here twice so far, and both times have ordered number #14 on the appetizer menu. I can't remember the exact name of it but I refer to it as crispy rice salad. One of the best dishes I can remember getting in a long time. 
The menu is very long and has a bigger variety than most typical Thai restaurants so you might need some guidance. On my first visit, the server recommended Sea Bass Drunken Noodles. I saw a prior reviewer mention it was \"like crack\" and I would have to agree with them. The Sea Bass was very tender and the noodles and sauce were very flavorful. The next time I came, I forced myself to try something different. The server recommended some sort of noodle dish that was more like soup. It was still good but I definitely preferred the drunken noodles to it. But really, seems like you can't go wrong with almost anything here.
We actually tried to come to Lotus of Siam several years ago but we thought we were in the wrong place since the center its in looks a bit run down, to put it nicely. So if you have never been here, be forewarned. Once you enter however, the place looks legit. Take a glance at all the pictures of celebrities and famous chefs who have dined here to convince you.
My only complaint is that they are not open for lunch on weekends. Since its location is a bit out of the way, it's more convenient to come to for lunch and I would guarantee I'd be here on every Vegas trip if I could come in for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday. On my last week Vegas trip, I literally scheduled my trip around a lunch visit here by going on a long weekend and staying through Monday. I won't always have that option though so unfortunately I'll probably miss out on the deliciousness of Lotus of Siam on some future trips to the desert."}
{"text":"Located in a godawful strip mall, Lotus of Siam is a surprisingly good restaurant. One clue to its allure is the long line of people outside, waiting for tables. We ordered the crispy duck and pad thai noodles, paired with a great Riesling. Delish! It's a casual place, gives good service, and is a welcome break from the expensive restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a local Las Vegas institution.

It's original Las Vegas location in the commercial center mall off Sahara is temporarily shut down for building repairs but scheduled to reopen. The new location on Flamingo/Paradise (the old Roy's) is a great improvement. The quality of everything has been improved to match the food. Plus a full bar now.

Chef/Owner Saipin Chutima is a local super star with a James Beard award to validate her hype. The menu is overwhelming with well over a hundred different items featuring food for all types of eaters. For example you will find fish, shellfish, chicken, pork, beef, tofu and vegetables served across all kinds of variations and spice levels.

This is definitely a restaurant that favors the adventurous and repeat visitors willing to delve into the depths of the menu treasure hunting for special items.

The food is delicious and the awards and reviews are there to justify. Expect unusual flavors and combinations, chef Chutima is \"Joel Robuchon\" if Thai food. My personal favorites are the Nam Kao Tod, Spicy Beef Salad, Tom Kha Khai hot pot, Panang Duck, Kao Soi, Drunken Noodles with your favorite protein... so many.

Also it's worth exploring their wine list, it's unusual to find a Thai restaurant with such an exceptional list. Don't be afraid to upgrade your Singh's to a bottle German Reisling for the true experience. The prices are very reasonable. Lotus is a great spot to get a truly gourmet meal without breaking the bank.

LoS is a multi generational family restaurant and it shows in the warm service and it's customer base of loyal locals.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"What a surprise when I came here! I was apprehensive to this place just from sight. But once in and seated I was floored! The service is great and the food it amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is def over-rated and way to expensive for Thai food. The claim is that it's the best Thai food in the country and that's not the case . We ordered the short rib panang, Isaan sausage, soft crab noodles, house fried rice and chicken salad. Although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish. I was expecting this place to blow my mind away but it was a major disappointment. $80 for 5 dishes is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Since there are already 90 reviews of this place let me keep this brief.  I generally don't like Thai food.  But I was in Vegas on business and by myself and wanted to stay off the Strip.  The YELP raves convinced me to give Lotus a try.

Bottom line -- its amazing.  Go.  Even if you hate Thai food, go.  The flavors are remarkable.   I had a soup, an appetizer, and a main dish and they were all spectacular.  And if you're into wine, the list looked amazing.

And BTW, their web site recommends reserving a day in advance, which I thought was a joke for an ethnic restaurant in a strip mall, but the place was thronged on Wednesday night.  I was lucky to be seated in 20 minutes.  You might want to call ahead."}
{"text":"The outside is nothing to speak about but once you're in it's packed.  Very popular place. The food was spectacular.  Salad with shrimp was so good.  Stew, chicken curry and pad Thai was delude as well."}
{"text":"I didn't believe the reviews that Lotus was THE best Thai in America, but it's true.  Go and be prepared to wait on line.  IT's SO worth it."}
{"text":"This is my first five star review ( actually 4 1/2, but yelp doesn't do halfsies, lol) my friend micheal, picked this spot, and I was wary of his choices,( due to the SF Chinatown incident, )and upon walking in we were the only people there, so I wasn't expecting much, but we were seated promptly & courteously. I wasn't familiar with much of the menu, and many dishes had oyster sauce of which I'm allergic to, but the waiter was patient and understanding and gave us some suggestions. The tum yum soup with chicken ( # 4 on his spicy scale was recommended ) it was amazing !! ,beautifully spiced , nice presentation if u r dining with 3 or more guests get the big one for a few dollars more it feeds 4 !! Big pieces of chicken and tons of mushrooms and tomato !! Next came the chicken satay, very tasty !! Than the crying tiger , thinly sliced beef it was awesome but served cold, ( as I'm not familiar with the dish, it is said that that is how it normally is served) but could have used a little warmth for my taste! Very soon our entree arrived basil crispy pork!! I could just die!! It was awesome! I requested no oyster sauce and they said they cooked it in soy sauce and chili sauce!! But the flavor was absolutely amazing!! Also the green curry was great , a little to sweet for my taste, but request the chili tray , so u can spice things up to your liking, my friend micheal ordered the minced chicken 15 star spicy, which I didn't try , but made my friend cry!! Micheal loves his spicy food!! Lol we finished by sharing a banana cheese cake which was the perfect compliement to an already great meal!! And as for micheal he has redeemed himself!! Altogether for 4 courses and soft drinks it was 35$ per person including tip!! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Do not let the dilapidated, East side Vegas shopping center deter you from walking into Lotus of Siam.  Behind the nondescript entrance intoxicating aromas entice you with an overabundance of simple yet exquisite Thai cuisine dishes.  The impressive, reasonably priced wine selection would put a Cheshire grin on the portly mug of Bacchus himself.

Jonathan Gold - food writer/ LA Times, said Lotus of Siam \"is the best Thai restaurant  in North America\".  I concur wholeheartedly.  Chef/Owner, Saipin Chutima implements the finest quality ingredients and melds flavors reminiscent of my experience of true Thai cuisine.  Chef Chutima opened Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, California although has since sold to family members.    

My dining group and I were punctual for our dinner reservation (dinner reservations are highly recommended) and were promptly seated in full view of the acclaimed wine cellar collection. 

After perusing the vast menu and conferring with our waiter we methodically choose  dishes from various regions in Thailand.  We found the Northern region to be the most interesting.  Even with a filled to capacity restaurant our server delivered our food in a timely manner.  

A main staple in Asian cuisine, garlic prawns are deep fried in the shell and served with a pungent sweet-salty garlic sauce. The Soft Shell Crab salad combines fresh chiles, lime and peanuts.  The small crab, with a light and crispy outer shell was tender and moist inside - a crustacean lover's delight .  A popular Northern dish is the Nam Prik Noom - gently roasted sweet green chilies, fresh garlic and tomatoes are pounded to a flavorful pulp in a mortar and served with pieces of crackly pig skins and sticky rice.  We requested Chef kick up the Scoville units for some serious classic Thai chili heat.  The result, HOT and delicious.

After enjoying two bottles of crispy white wine and traditional Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert it was time for my satiated dining group to depart Lotus of Siam.  As I waited for our taxi to arrive I visualized future trips to the neglected shopping center where star Chef Saipin Chutima passionately awaits those who savor traditional Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is very well made and delicious. We ordered fried rice, spicy pad thai, pad see-ew, and red curry. We ordered it at medium spicy, and while we didn't think some of our dishes reflected that the pad thai was very spicy. The service is wonderful and the decor is very tasteful as well. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam lived up to the hype.  It was the best Thai I have ever had.  I ate there on Sunday at 6pm and luckily I had a reservation as there was a 90 minute wait.  For appetizers I ordered yum nuah, or Thai beef salad, and tom yum kai, a lime and lemongrass-infused hot and sour chicken soup.  Both were fantastic.  I ordered everything with a heat level of 4.  I should have done a 6 in hindsight as it wasn't too much spice.  For a main course I ordered duck khao soi which was a curry noodle soup.  It was phenomenal.  The perfect amount of curry and the duck was cooked fantastically.  I'll be back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  I have been known to come here on multiple nights and skip some of the other trendy places for a good meal...it really is that GREAT!  We skipped Craft Steakhouse to come here a second consecutive night!  Anyone that I have taken here.....LOVES IT!  

The way to do it....come here and eat!  Then go back to hotel get ready for the night out....have a few drinks towards the end of your getting ready time.  Then go out!  You will not be too full....feel perfect...and will be all fresh to go out for the night!!

So...food:

-Tom Yum-Clear broth soup is tasty
-LOVE Tom Kah Kai! Coconut soup...AWESOME!
-Garlic Prawn- AWESOME! SO great!  Everyone loves this!
-Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves- Yummy! (I have also tried it panang style and I liked with Mint Leaves version better
-Catfish and eggplant are good too...but overall...the orders above are my faves so far.

Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This was beyond good! Friends of us (from Vegas) suggested this restaurant. Off Strip. In - for us - the middle of nowhere. A desolate piece of commercial space. We had to search for right adress because it's on not on the road side.

The Lotus of Siam is so popular that's reservations only. If you're not there on time (5 minutes prior to your reservation) they give away your table. Outside the're lines. And we know why.

We're a party of six with one real Thai Lady. Just in the USA for less than six months. Even she liked and approved the meals.

We had different dishes to share. The dishes that most impressed were the crispy duck, the pineapple rice and the Tom Kah Kai. All together we order two hot pot's of soup, the garlic shrimps and seven main courses. With a few alchoholic consumptions the total bill ran up tot $250 for six people. Not much for such a nice meal. We'll definitly be back."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place arguably being the best Thai in the states. I haven't been to enough to compare, but my first time experience with Lotus of Siam is pretty damn good. 

When we rolled up, we had an awkward feeling about this place as the exterior seemed really dinky and the spaces around this strip mall have pretty much gone out of business. But as we saw people waiting around in the front for it to open....and asian, this was our good sign. It was like the moment Dorothy opened the front door to her house and stepped into Oz. They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.

It was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.  I'm thinking that part of the reason why their food is so delicious is because they utilize their different flavors, textures, and consistencies so successfully.

We ordered the following:
Nam Kao Tod
Green Tofu Curry 
Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage)
Drunken Noodles with Chicken
Nam Prik Ong with Sticky Rice (Red Chili Dip)
Coconut Ice cream with Fried Bananas 

Amongst my uncle, cousin and myself, it was definitely way too difficult to rank our favorites; and we kept adding on to our tab because it's one of those places where you want to literally try everything on the menu.

We also kept hearing people mention that they had redone the place, maybe for more room to hang their awards and pictures of celebrities.

Chances of coming back? OF COURSE!!!!! (already on my list when I come back to Vegas)"}
{"text":"Great noodles and tasty pad Thai. Good service. Yummy sticky rice w mango. I would go back."}
{"text":"The food was great. We ordered a thai Tom yum Khuong but I wish they would use straw mushrooms rather than the button mushroom because that would be more authentic."}
{"text":"Superb dishes! Great quality food and well-made. The ambiance is somewhat bright and too open for my liking -it lacks intimacy, but the food more than makes up for it. Definitely a spot to visit."}
{"text":"I have a cousin from San Francisco who comes out to Vegas JUST TO EAT HERE. Every time I tell him I'm off to Vegas, he tells me to go eat here, and I don't and this time, I listened. We went. We devoured. We were VERY satisfied.

The food is amazing. Best Thai ever.  I don't get it, the mixture of flavors is unbelievable. Slightly more expensive than we expected it to be - probably because I didn't take a look at the prices (oops).  Never the less, it was so worth it.  AWESOME dishes: Drunken chilean sea bass, some appetizer with rice crispies (kom kao tod or something), def get a combo of the coconut ice cream, sticky rice and mango for dessert, crab fried rice, and the garlic charbroiled beef. It's in a random strip mall and a little out of the way but the restaurant has a nice list of taxi companies for you to call when you're heading back to the LV strip."}
{"text":"The old location was run down but the food was five stars.  I can't wait to visit this brand new location and try the Drunken Sea Bass again!"}
{"text":"Kao Soi: (10/10) This Northern Thai noodle dish was amazing! I live in LA and am tempted to drive 4 hours one way just to have this sweet heavenly dish in me again. The soup was spicy and coconut-y, the noodles looked handmade and were cooked to perfection. This almost reminds me of the Singaporean dish \"Laska\" but dare I say this might have been a little closer to heaven. I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Northern Larb (Pork: (9/10) This dish was H-O-T and S-P-I-C-Y to the high heavens. Dear Lord. But it was so tasty and so good especially with a bit of lime and rice to accompany the dish. 

Panang Curry: (7/10) This panang curry was good but was overshadowed by the Kao Soi dish. Tasted very similar but just not as good. The chicken was a tad dry and the portions weren't that great. 

Tom Yum Kai Soup: (5/10) Honestly this soup was very bland and tasted like water with spice in it. 

Mango Sticky Rice: (10/10): Perfect sticky rice and the mango was so sweet and ripe! One of the best mango sticky rice I've had - even compared to ones in Hong Kong/Thailand

________
Service was great and very quick. Never had to ask them to fill up the water myself. 
Cleanliness of the restaurant was alright, its a Thai restaurant so don't expect pristine fine dining. Location was a little far from the main parts of Vegas, but there is a TON of parking everywhere."}
{"text":"They say this may be the best Thai food in the U.S. And they are not mistaken. This place is amazing!  From the decor to the service to the FOOD!  We had several things that we shared and there was not one thing we were not salivating over after we were done. It will be one of those places that I crave. Even if you are not a THAI food fan, there are things here that you will love!  This is a must if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here the Friday after Thanksgiving with my wife and her family. Her parents grew up in Thailand, so they are tough to please with Thai food. But this place was terrific. 

It was a bit tricky to find because it's in a strip mall facing away from the road that the address points you to, so you have to double back around to the parallel street to find the parking lot. But it was worth it.

The Penang Crispy Duck Curry and the Lad Na were particularly awesome"}
{"text":"I'm wasn't impressed with the buffet. With all these Yelp reviews I was looking forward to it but maybe this is the best Thai in Vegas? I hope not."}
{"text":"Easily our most disappointing meal of our week-long Vegas trip, and especially painful because it was the one spot I convinced people we absolutely needed to go to... but at least the service was great.
Most of the table ordered spice level 1-4*, and I went with a 6, and still felt virtually nothing, even though my crispy duck panang looked like it'd pack a punch. Pad thai (yes, someone ordered it), was the usual. Basil chicken was forgettable.
Green chile dip was fine. The famous garlic prawns had maybe 2 pieces with actual meat, the rest was batter and/or shells. Thai Teas were standard. We got dessert elsewhere, as they were out of the mango and nothing else sounded appealing.

TIP: Call in your reservation, as there was availability despite their site seeming booked for weeks. In fact, we really didn't need our reservation for 5 (which we were shocked they so easily let us change from 4 at the last minute, until we arrived: Somehow the place was absolutely dead at 8:30pm on a Friday)...sure, I know it's Vegas and not everyone just eats the whole trip, but don't people hit the strip at all hours, and isn't this place supposed to always be mobbed?

*At a Northern Thai spot I realize this is a bad move, but I've had good Northern Thai meals with the same mild seasoning."}
{"text":"people aren't kidding when they say this place looks ghetto from the outside! It IS in the ghetto, but once you walk in, the restaurant is pretty nice. They have a huge menu. 

We ordered the pad thai and tom kha ghai soup..both super good. and of course, thai tea :) I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm craving thai food!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! We tried a bunch of different plates, I couldnt name them all. But i can tell you that everything here is good. Worth a stop in if you are in Vegas and are looking for a good place to eat. If you can, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! My friends and I ordered different dishes from curry to pad Thai to the absolutely amazing garlic prawns which were most definitely my favorite! We also ordered some appetizers, the stuffed chicken wings were awesome, they were perfectly cooked and the chicken was so juicy and full of flavor! We also had Nam Kao Tod which was mouth watering and SO amazing my second favorite dish aside from the garlic prawns! We definitely cleaned our plates that night! Sorry I couldn't add the stuffed chicken wings or the Nam Kao Tod they were so good I forgot I take a picture! But If you're in Vegas you have to stop in and try Lotus of Siam out! You will not regret it! I can't wait to plan my next visit to Vegas and this will always be one of my stops when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Khao Soi. It was excellent. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely go back. Don't judge this place by the exterior. The inside is very nice and comfortable."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  I have eaten at many Thai places in my life and I have to say this place is one of the best.  There papaya was spicy and just right.  There pad Thai was cooked and tasted amazing.  It had the sweet and spicy texture just like how I like it!"}
{"text":"No organization for the wait list. Seated a party that was after us and told me to my face they were ahead of us by 1. No, we saw them come in and put their name down after we've been there for a good while. 

Horrible experience. Ended up leaving after over 1.5 hours. It ended up being A few minutes shy if 2 hours Told me we were 10th in line at 7:30. At 8:30 when i checked in again, we were supposedly 5th in line.

We had a show to catch and planned to eat then go. Skipped them this next vegas visit and they will no longer a priority to visit."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam tastes Authentic but the price sure isn't. I've been to the Best Place in NYC (SriPhadPhai) and the prices are half of Lotus of Siams. 

The Bacon wrapped Shrimp were Okay.
The Veggie Tom Yum delicious, as was the Chicken Pad Thai.
The Food here is AWESOME. 
Be forewarned, on a scale of 1-10, a 6-7 will make someone with a high spice tolerance teary eyed- to the point you won't taste your food."}
{"text":"Deep fried pork jerky w/sticky rice
Chuchee prawns
Three flavored Sea Bass
Garlic shrimp
Anything with duck in it

These are the keys to the kingdom, guard it with your life, these dishes will never steer you wrong my friends, I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Bad experience, would not reccomend mussel omlete  very greasy and almost impossible to cut with knife and fork, wow, hot pot not hot!Shame on Siam"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great.
I had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Seems like the food isn't as good as the original time we've been here.  This place is pretty pricey for Thai food.  Overall the food is better than most Thai restaurants in the LV area but I think they are really over priced."}
{"text":"The Crispy Duck Curry with drunkin noodles...  OMG!!  one of the best foods I have ever eatten.  IN MY LIFE!!"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food I have ever had. Mind blown. Didn't think it could be so good.
Short Rib Panang bomb.com, Garlic Prawns and Pad Thai... So good!!!"}
{"text":"We drove here for the final night of our Vegas trip.  We generally like to eat off the strip mainly because the food on the strip isn't that good and fairly expensive.  Leaves more money for gambling.  The restaurant is located more north and to the east of the main strip.  

The restaurant doesn't look like a restaurant, it was in some old store that got converted.  The windows were all painted or covered.  The area appears to be bad, but the food was great.  Ate here with 2 Thai people and they loved it.  The food was authentic.  If we found this restaurant earlier, we would've eaten here more often."}
{"text":"Went out to eat with some friends.  Because we all love Thai it was an easy choice.  For appetizers we got the Chicken Sa-Tay and Crispy Chicken Wings.  The Sa-Tay was good but similar to the Sa-Tay at almost any Thai restaurant. The Crispy Chicken Wings were very good and had a great flavor with the garlic and crispy skin.  For dinner I ordered Panang Curry.  They gave me the wrong level of spiciness and the curry flavor was poor.  I also ordered some Pad Thai and was surprised with how small the portion was.  This was not my first time at this restaurant, but this was my most disappointing trip."}
{"text":"Northern Thai dishes are excellent.  Mushroom dip with steamed veggies, young jackfruit curry and pad see ew were great.  I also tried a northern Thai sausage, which was very interesting and tasty.  Note, spice level 8/10 was indeed eye watering."}
{"text":"Great food! Love this place.
Have tried about 10 different things on the menu, everyone was a winner.
There are people that I do business with that are from Orlando, and they insist that we go every time they are here."}
{"text":"Being that yelpers loves this place, we decided to try it. Overall, the food was good. However, I have tasted similar dishes elsewhere and it was normal for me. We had the duck curry, fried fish, pad Tai, drunking noodles seafood, salad seafood and tom Yum soup."}
{"text":"Thanks to my Brother, Chris, for his suggestion.  A wonderful meal.  This was a highlight.  The waitress suggested Tom Kah Kai  as a first course (#23 on the soup menu).  What a wonderful coconut mild based soup.  Sweet, sour, salty and spicy all competing for my palate.  I have never experienced such a complex tasting soup.  I would recommend this soup to everyone. 

Lotus of Siam gets top ratings."}
{"text":"Great place!
I'm a returning customer for that place. Every time In Vegas, this is one of my favorite. 
The food, service and the experience are always great. 
Can't wait to the next time!"}
{"text":"so, i was gung-ho for the level 9 spiciness. nate talked me into the level 8.  after the apetizer plate, i was sweating so bad that they sent out a thai iced tea just to help.  this was spicy nirvana.  the drunken soft shell crab is easy top five of all food experiences. the cherry on top of my las vegas sundae........"}
{"text":"Had the most authentic Thai barbecue chicken. The aroma was exactly the same as this I had in Bangkok bringing back all the wonderful memories."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Everything you order is bomb. I was never disappointed and it makes my mouth watered just thinking about it. Must try if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"NOTE: YOU MUST make reservations before coming here!!! If you don't you're basically going to wait for someone who IS on the reservations list to not show up or cancel. 
Food here is beyond expectations. Outstanding quality and very good. I came here with my parents for a total of 3 and we ordered 7 dishes; Combination Pad Thai, Seabass w/ samm rod sauce, Shrimp Thai Fried rice, Soft Shell Crab Salad, Panang Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawn, and Tom Yum Prawn.(3/10 spicy range) 
All of them were super good. The Garlic Prawn is a must, the Pad Thai is killer, Seabass w/ Samm-rod sauce is bomb, and the Soft Shell Crab salad is fire. This was my first time here and I would most likely come here again next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"First off fair warning, this place is located in the shadiest part of Vegas. The address is not really posted. We actually drove right past it. 

My girlfriend found out about this place after watching Food Network's \" Best thing I've ever ate, Las Vegas 2011.\" Man am I thankful she Tivo'd that episode. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, Green Chicken Curry, this pasty pork dip surrounded by vegetables. There was a lot of people in this restaurant and surprisingly the waiters were very attentive.

Our meal was just perfect. These are the types of restaurants I hate reviewing because they are so good. Trust me the ten minute drive off the strip is well worth it. You will not find a meal for this price anywhere on the strip. Everything here was just excellent."}
{"text":"Not the best thai food i've ever had but pretty dang close.  

Living in vegas i'm selfishly glad this place isn't in the middle of the strip.

Awesome $8.99 buffet for lunch.  Incredible bargain.

Very good service and the price tag pushes it up to a 4 star in my book.

They did a great job on the needed expansion completed not too long ago.  Note if you're there there are now restrooms in the back of each room."}
{"text":"Best thai food I have EVER had! I know what your thinking when you read that \"this guys standard for thai food is really low\" - wrong! OR maybe \"this guy hasn't eaten much thai food\" - wrong again! I love thai, I eat it all the time mainly cause it's my wife's favorite too! The flavor in the food here is outstanding! I read some articles about this place before visiting, they were saying this is the best thai restaurant in Vegas and they were right!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Thai food in Vegas, by far. I don't even feel the need to write more than that, but I will. 

Chef Saipin was gracious enough to greet me and wish me a happy birthday while me and my family dined here. Their staff made excellent suggestions as to what to get. Papaya salad, soft shell crab noodles, drunken noodles, pad thai, fried prawns, the soup... that could have been my last meal and I would've been fine with that.

Don't let the location around the Lotus of Siam fool you. This place is well known for a reason."}
{"text":"According to my friends, Lotus of Siam is ranked as \"the BEST Thai Restaurant in America.\"  I'm not really sure who's ranking system this is, but I would declare Lotus of Siam \"the best AUTHENTIC Thai Restaurant in America\" (based on my non-encompassing Thai restaurant experiences).  Unlike a lot of other hyped-up restaurants that I have visited, LoS does provide freshly-made, high-quality, and unique Thai foods that you will not be able to find @ 99% of the general Thai restaurants out there.  Apparently, Pad Thai,  Pad See-ew, and Thai Iced Tea are not the best representation of Thai cuisine :P  

So before you jump for joy about possibly eating the best Thai food you'll ever eat again, make sure you prepare yourself for a few.....surprises. First, LoS is located in probably one of the slummiest parts of Vegas; there isn't a strip club next door, but there are numerous sex and fetish shops across the street and just down the block. I don't recommend taking little Tommy and exploring the area before & after dinner....you may be opening the door to too many unnecessary questions.  Next, the wait time @ LoS during dinner hours on the weekend is going to be LONG.  For some reason, they don't allow reservations (guess they're so popular that they can demand such unreasonable policies).  Our table of 10 had to wait 1hr and 45 minutes, which we ended up killing at the pool table next door (**warning, it is a very divey, local pool point that's musty, dark, smokey, and seems as though everyone is selling crack or selling themselves***)

So once you get past the exterior facades and downsides, LoS will undoubtedly provide you a unique Thai dining experience that you shall not find elsewhere in Vegas and most areas.  Their menu is about 10 pages long, and these are all separated into rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, chef's specialities, and then even a \"recommended\" dishes.   I was lucky enough to go with such a large group that we ordered over 10 dishes and got to sample a wide variety of dishes. 

I can assert that their rice dishes are very....normal and not-special, but their noodle dishes and specialty dishes were worth the price of admission.  Their  shrimp fried rice was actually below-average (or lacked MSG lol).   If you are a fan of fish, ask for their steamed fish that is fresh and super flavorful & tender.  Spiciness was not an issue for most dishes unless you request the \"Thai spicy\" vs \"American spicy\"   Another memorable dish was the boneless beef ribs, which were great except you only get FOUR small little ribs.  So yes, we split that amongst 10 people through some surgical precision with our butter knife.   Finally, the other dish I remembered was their curry.  It was flavorful, not too rich or thick, and the added meat & veggies was definitely a good complement.  

Lastly, the service provided was excellent, the waiter was actually useful in suggesting good dishes, and he also seemed like a \"happy\" employee who was proud of working @ \"the best Thai restaurant in America.\" He even boasted that they had recently filmed a Top Chef episode in Vegas the week before.  Next time, I shall go again and try some newer dishes and provide an update.  Til then, I better not find another Thai restaurant anointed as \"best Thai restaurant in the World/Galaxy/Universe\" or else i'll have to reevaluate my current review :P"}
{"text":"Nothing new being said here that the other 3000+ reviews haven't said, but the Lotus of Siam is some of the best thai food I have ever had! Had to go a few times on my last trip to Vegas just to be able to try more things since the menu is the size of a phone book. Seriously, take the time and prepare before you go! Study the menu and get a game plan for what you plan to get, because if you just try to decide on the spot you will end up in a stupor! So many amazing things to choose from and everything I had was fantastic. The crispy duck panang was outstanding, as was the garlic prawns, basil scallops, whole catfish, drunken noodles, everything!! Extremely popular spot in Vegas, even with it being a decent ride off the strip and in a very odd strip mall, but it is always packed so be sure to make a reservation! But Lotus of Siam is wonderful thai cuisine with enough options to satisfy any thai lover!"}
{"text":"Average food; poor service. 

Our experience fell very short of our expectations. We kept hearing people talk about this place, they must not know what a great Thai food is! 

We met our friends at the bar upon arriving. The restaurant was packed in the waiting area which was very very small. Our friends were waiting at the bar so we joined them. The bartender lady handed the menu and the entire time we were there (a good 20minutes) never turned around and asked for our drink orders. Poor first impression!

We ordered a bunch of food to share on the table. I am a big seafood person and prior to going in, I checked Yelp for the \"must order\" items. I ordered the garlic prawns that everyone is raving about. It was average, nothing amazing. Honestly, I still prefer and love Pho Kim Long's salt and pepper shrimp! More flavorful and half the price!  

We paid our bill and was finishing our drinks. The server kept coming back and asking if we needed anything else and we said no. Not long after, the lady bartender who ignored us at the bar came to our table and asked us if it's ok if we leave cause people are waiting for our table. Really??? We work in the service industry here in Vegas for a long time. Never ever have I experienced being asked to leave! This place is over rated, will never come back again! There are a lot of other Thai restaurant that are  way better in taste and service!"}
{"text":"What and Amazing Experience! The food was flavorful, freshly prepared, and spot on! What an amazing wine list - my friend is a Sommelier - was mesmerized by the variety and affordable price point. The only thing that I have to say negative is that the service is not nearly as OUTSTANDING as the food!"}
{"text":"Talk about a \"don't judge a book by its cover\" restaurant.  Had a party of 12 and lucky to have the reservation.  This Thai food is even better than some of the Thai I have had in Southeast Asia.  Must have!!!  Try a little of everything!"}
{"text":"I like going a little off course and not always eating on the strip because then I discover places like Lotus of Siam.  

They have GOOD Thai food.  We ordered the pad thai and spicy yellow curry and couldn't let our forks/chopsticks down.  The curry was perfectly spicy with tons of flavors and NOT watered down (like other cheap Thai places).  The pad thai noodles were perfectly cooked--not too soggy/mushy and just dry enough to appreciate the subtle flavors.

We packed our big plates to-go and ordered the thai iced tea for dessert.  So good."}
{"text":"Three words....Nam Kao Tod. This dish is #1 on my \"last meal\"  list. There's nothing else I have found on this planet that compares. I have yet to find it offered at any other Thai restaurant....and even if I did, I can't imagine it being any better. Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I will come here for what I can only describe as Culinary Nirvana....a flavor orgy unparalleled."}
{"text":"We were very fortunate that we were able to eat at this wonderful restaurant. They had only been reopened for five days and we got there right when it opened. The food was amazing. I had the Khao Soi and my kids had Phad Thai. We enjoyed fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert. This restaurant was well worth any wait."}
{"text":"Next to city Thai this is one of my fav spots.  That being said don't hate Grish but this place has the most velvety (as if this is a real word) Khao soi.  Short ribs Thai dish."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing!!! we had pad Thai,pad see ew, garlic prawn, mussels. Everything was delicious!  Nothing went wrong. Their customer service is great! Nothing to complain about this place!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait if you want great Thai food! Curry crispy duck is soooo good! One of the great fines in Vegas. Dont let the outside deceive you."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the best meals I've ever had.

I'm a chef. I came here with 5 friends and we ordered 14 dishes and dessert. Everything was solid. Not a single misstep. The restaurant was full and food came out way faster than expected. This place is addicting. I wish I had one of these at home. It baffles me that Lotus of Siam has 4 stars on Yelp. Shows how much bullshit the rating system is. Also everyone who posted a pic and reviewed this place only posted pad Thai. What a bunch of fucking horse shit. This place has so many authentic northern Thai dishes. Every singl one, crazy delicious. Fuck you Yelp"}
{"text":"Made our way to the much celebrated Lotus of Siam while in Las Vegas and had a decent meal but left unimpressed. Billed as the best Thai in the country, I was surprised to find most of the food to be comparable to the good Thai places I eat at while at home. The prawns were awesome, everything else we ordered was nothing special. Pretty good, but definitely fell short of the hype and expectations."}
{"text":"\"OMG\" is a phrase I would use to describe this place. It's in a strip mall off the strip. Looks like a rundown, dirty, mom and pop thai restaurant that is struggling to make ends meet from the outside. Remember that saying \"looks can be deceiving?\" Well that's exactly what I was thinking when I walked out. The four of us feasted on some of the best thai I've ever had. Our meals included apps, soups, main courses, dessert and everything was amazing. They have a nice size menu and all their items have great descriptions. I would highly recommend checking this place out! Don't have a car in Vegas? I would say it's worth the cab ride."}
{"text":"Ok so maybe it was the awesome reviews that I read before I came here that I expected sooo much from them which resulted in the lower rating than I had even expected to give! We came here for lunch on NYE! 10 min wait for a table pretty nice...service was very good...we ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup based on someone's review..and it was just OK..nothing WOW about it...the Green Curry w/Chicken was the BEST thing we tried! It had the awesome spicy factor we loved! The Drunken Noodles w/seafood was disappointing cuz the dish was so greasy...granted we were super full from the meal but based on my BF and our visits to many other Thai places in SoCal..we can't rightly say this was the BEST Thai food we've had...we might have to give it another try on our next visit..."}
{"text":"Arriving in Vegas at 7:30pm and hungry, we met up with our local friend for dinner.  She suggested Lotus of Siam which was near the airport.  The restaurant is on Flamingo and has its own large parking lot.  Walking in, we met our friend and she said there was a 45 minute wait for a table. She said we could sit at the bar area and order food there. Hungry as we were, it was a no brainer.

Aside from the bar counter, there are several sofas sections with tables.  Luckily, there was an available one. The waiter put two tables together for us and we were ready to go.  Checking out the extensive menu, we picked out a couple of items.  Not sure of which curry to order, we asked our waiter for a recommendation.  
Our order consisted of:
Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and imitation crab with fresh & dry chili, Thai basils. Tasty, but wished there were more noodles in the dish. 

Pineapple Fried Rice Stir-fried with yellow curry powder, pineapples, shrimps and chicken. Very flavorful and it had a couple of food size shrimp in it. 

Panang Curry with beef.  This curry is cooked with chilis, coconut milk and Thai Basil. We asked our waiter how spicy the curry was. He said its spiciness could be made from a scale of 1-10. Since two in our group could not take much spiciness, we went with 3. The curry had good flavor, but it was to me closer to medium. It was too much on the spiciness for the two in our group. 

Overall, a good Thai food in a nice, modern, spacious environment. Our friend said this restaurant use to be a Roy's before it closed and taken over by Lotus of Siam.  Not the best Thai food that I've tried, but it's pretty good I guess for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Probably not the best Thai food I've ever had since Thai Town in LA is closer than Vegas, but this place did impress me.  I don't think I can count how many times people have mentioned Lotus of Siam to me in passing.  Lotus of Siam is tucked away in a strip mall on Sahara away from the Las Vegas Strip.  It's somewhat small and unassuming but the food is pretty good.  They do have the chili condiments on the side if you request it because everyone enjoys different levels of heat in their food.  

My friends and I met up for a SoCal UYE of sorts while here on Yelp Spring Break.  We arrived before the restaurant opened for lunch.  At lunch they offer an AYCE buffet for $10.99 but you can also order a la carte too.  We decided to order off of the menu.  

We tried: 

Crispy Duck (5 stars) - By far my favorite dish, the duck was de-boned and fried to a crisp with excellent flavor.
Chicken Satay (4 stars) - I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  It's really easy to overcook chicken but this was great.  The peanut dipping sauce and cucumber salad condiments were spot on.
Yellow Curry (3 stars) - Pretty standard curry but the vegetables were undercooked.  I like my curry vegetables to be a little softer.
Pad See Ew with beef (3 stars) - Pretty standard.  The noodles were soft and the Chinese broccoli was good.  

The service was ok at best.  We did ask for a large table because we were expecting a large party, however, we were stood up.  The waiter expressed that they could split our bill into 4 but that was the max he would do.  After our dishes were brought out, he disappeared until we had to flag him down for our check.  No matter.  The food was good, we were happy.  No reservations for lunch but they take reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam makes arguably the best Thai food in the USA. It's authentic as it gets outside of Thailand. The lunch buffets are the best in town. For under $10, you can get a wide variety of dishes, which changes all the time so you don't get bored with the same selection. 

I had dinner here with a girlfriend recently and was pleasantly surprised that Lotus had expanded and now also has a bar. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The wine selection is huge, especially for an Asian establishment. 

We ordered the stuffed chicken wings, papaya salad, Tom Kha Kai, and Crab Fried Rice. I had to keep the selection tame since my gf is still new to Thai cuisine. The Crab Fried Rice is exceptionally good here, made with real chunks of crab


Lotus is the only Thai restaurant that includes dishes cooked with jackfruit and other exotic ingredients. They also make a killer fried catfish dish which is smothered in a sweet chili sauce. I wish there were more people with us so that I could order that big dish. Another one of my favorite dish here is the Tom Yum Noodle Soup. I love Tom Yum soup but this is the first place where I discovered the noodle version of this dish. I love Pho & Hu Tieu and this is a great Thai version of the two. It's great to eat on a cold day."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much since I heard that this place is amazing and we failed to get a table the last time we were in town.  We did get the crispy curry duck which was good but not amazing.  Maybe we didn't order the right stuff?  But I felt like the food I get in Thai town in LA better.  I will try it again because everyone that says it's better than I expected."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times and quality has quickly declined. The menu makes very little sense, portions were tiny and entrees were cold. For very expensive Thai food, you should keep looking. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Ok, Ok, i get it. Northern Style Thai.  This reminded me of Ruen Pair in LA, but man, Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype. Yes, we waited a full hour for a table but since everyone else was doing it, we did it too!

Try the specials because you can't get that anywhere else.  The drunken noodles with the Softshell crabs was hands down my favorite dish there.

AMAZE!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the area/exterior fool you.

One of our relatives rant and raved about Lotus of Siam so we put it on our bucket list. It is hard to find because the restaurant is not facing the highway. During the day the shopping center almost looks deserted. There is a warning inside the restaurant about vehicle break-ins and not leaving luggage and valuables in plain sight. The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is all the articles about the Lotus of Siam. We were seated and waited on quickly. The wine list is amazing, they have one large glass enclosed area with racks of wine. There is another room that also is full of wine. Nine Wine Spectator awards are on the wall. 

My sister's Koong Teen, grilled shrimp with spicy sauce on top of sliced cabbage was tasty. The shrimp were tender and the sauce gave it a kick. I was leery of the raw cabbage but it had sort of a fish sauce that actually turned out to be like an Asian coleslaw. I ordered the Pad Thai and was asked if I wanted it spicy and I said yes. It turned out just right, it made you sweat a little. The garlic prawn and the crispy rice was very flavorful (according to my sister's boyfriend) and had been accompanied .by a very tasty Cucumber Salad. The Panang did have some thing I never had in a curry, grape tomatoes and red grapes. This restaurant is worth a visit if you like Thai food.

Prices are extremely reasonable, a great bargain and a great find in a town with no shortage of over-priced, over-hyped food and drink. When you consider all of the overpriced and overhyped restaurants in the casinos on the strip, this was one experience that we were glad we did not miss. I can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"Not fine dining. 
Mediocre service. 
Extremely long menu for food and wine. 
5/5 stars for the food. The red curry is the best I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain, and it is pretty good.  Really surprised on how well it was"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and look towards the Northern Thai food menu. Otherwise, holy shit, the Soft Shell Crab over Drunken Noodles.

Thank you. 
You're welcome."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've ever had. The Tofu Pad Thai was so great we ordered more. The crispy garlic prawns are a must try - half was the crunchy shell half was big delicious prawns held together by the tail, you eat them both!  The whole fish with ginger was favorite along with the chicken wings & beef satay  - you could tell it was cooked over wood, it had a smokey flavor.  We ordered quite a few items, all were good, most were great.  

The wine list is focused on wined that compliment Thai food (Riesling).  We ordered a magnum for the table - perfect.  

We brought a friend who had never had Thai food before, it was a hit.  I love family restaurants that does such a great job.  It's no wonder this place was PACKED.  A Vegas favorite."}
{"text":"Great find in Vegas, especially if you enjoy N Thai food, the Khao Soi was super! They have a buffet lunch for about $10, but I suggest ordering one or more of their specialty dishes. We will be back again to try more items on the menu as everything was delicious. Good tip - you can walk up to bar and have a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"MAKE A RESERVATION.

Don't be a dumbass and not make a reservation.  If you are going to vegas and have about a week of notice, you should be able to get a slot no problem.  It's not a ridiculous wait for walk-ins, but it's an unnecessary wait if you just pick up the phone.

The food.

In short, thai food executed at a high level without being pretentious.

My recommendations:  

Appetizers:

Spicy garlic chicken wings - These wings are deep fried to get the skin nice and crispy and glazed in a sweet garlic chili sauce that make for the right balance of sweet, spicy, salty and crispy.

Nam Kao Tod:  
Crispy rice with pieces of pork and green onion.  This dish, if I recall correctly has some spice to it.  Not for everyone, but a nice textual accompaniment.

Mains:

Pad Thai - A refreshingly light take on something that can be bogged down with sauce.  The right balance of noodles, peanuts and sauce.

Pad See Ew - This was good, I don't recall what was in it exactly

Garlic prawns - If you order anything from this list, make sure you order these.  These are large prawns that are breaded and deep fried to the point where the shells are edible (if you don't mind a bit of chewing).  These are my favorite here.

Panang curry - I'm not a curry fan, but this was good.

In short, catch a cab and look for the weird Green Door massage parlor and you'll see the line out the door for this place.   If you have reservations, you'll have a great dinner."}
{"text":"Worth the drive to the middle of nowhere in Vegas, and despite the location, the food is so good there is still a 45 min wait for a table. 

Close your eyes and order and enjoy."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks like it would be tiny because the plaza is a bit of a ghost town. When I walked inside the waiting area, I felt like my suspicion was confirmed. The hostess offered for us to wait at their bar (all I remember thinking was how how a place so small could possibly fit a bar), and that was when I found that they do have ample space in the restaurant. 

The food we ordered for the most part were all good, but two notable dishes that pushed me to give 5 stars instead of 4 were the catfish salad and the garlic prawns."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The food was awesome. Panang duck was incredible. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food, specializing in Northern Thai cuisine. One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Often very crowded/long wait, so make reservations.

I found this place pretty randomly -- it was the nearest restaurant to my hotel. It was packed at opening at 1730h, so I sat at the bar, but even the bar filled up quickly.  Extra benefit of sitting at the bar: the bartender was friendly and had good information about the food.

I had \"Northern Larb\", a northern version of tom kha gai, and \"drunken crab\" (served on top of noodles).  All were excellent, and unique (I'm used to Bangkok-style food, since that's what has been most widely exported, and when I lived in Thailand, I was in the South).  

The only drawback is this place gets really crowded, so you'll definitely want reservations."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is tucked way away in a dowdy strip mall, but don't let that discourage you. It's not a shady, sketchy area, and the excellent food really makes it worth coming. My party had a great meal. There's a full bar with a diverse beer and wine list, and over 130 menu items mean it's easy to find something you like. Our server wasn't hugely attentive but the food came out promptly and correctly. I had a delicious yellow curry. In general, the food was on the spicier side, but everything I tasted was great."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai spots. The crunchy rice is amazing. They have a surprisingly large wine list and the variety is impressive! It's no wonder this spot is one of the top restaurants in America. Each time I've been here the service is on point and so is the food! It's in a sketchy part of town and the strip mall it's in is hysterically ghetto. I think one of the shops is a Vietnamese wig store. And I think just a little bit over is a transsexual bar. Go for the sights and be happy you did because the food is oh my god good!"}
{"text":"I've only experienced takeout from this place and I've never been more disappointed. My friends and I decided to grab takeout due to the long wait and we ordered the crispy duck curry and the drunken noodles.

First off, we had originally ordered the regular duck curry, but the lady told us that we should get the crispy duck because it was what the restaurant was known for. Given that the price of the crispy duck was more than double the price of the regular, she assured us that the portion of crispy duck was much larger and enough for 3. Thus, we decided to pay $28. She told us the wait would be 25 min.

We ended up waiting much more than an hour for takeout. Upon finally getting our food and opening the boxes, we found in the large takeout box, only 11 thin pieces of crispy duck, a carton of curry, and a small box of rice. For $28, it was simply a RIP-OFF. Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, but completely not worth the price. And we felt cheated.

The drunken noodles were decent but I've had better at many other places."}
{"text":"Delish Dude!!  The Tom Kah soup is soooooooooooooooooo good (lemongrass-coconut milk), I could swim in it! 
They have a buffet for lunch, which has mostly meat items - so I had the Yellow Curry with tofu instead, I was a happy camper fo shizzle!!
It's not an ambiance rich environment, so don't expect an amazing setting.....
But TRY to make a reservation if you can get ahold of them, it's ALWAYS busy and ALWAYS a wait, but worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. A bit expensive, but I wasn't paying! ;)

I don't feel like repeating things that were already said, so if you're interested, get in line early and order fast! 

My party was in and out in 30 minutes. 

Favorite dish was the Pad Thai, but the Crispy Duck Panang was equally amazing!"}
{"text":"been Eating here For years Very good Pizza. If Your looking for Cheap Not fresh ingredients. go to Pappa Johns or one of those places .... NYC pizza"}
{"text":"Love this thai food!! Whenever I eat thai food everywhere Me & my husband alway order the same food..Pad see ew & curry ( red,yellow,penang).. The first time I ate at Lotus siam 2012..I really like their food & always go there whenever we want eat thai food.4 months ago we went to Nothern thailand & try their traditional food 'Kao soi kai' & we love it. So when we came back to vegas & eat at my favorite thai place 'Lotus siam', I saw they have 'Kao soi kai'.. It's really good & authentic, the flavor is really balance.. So GOOD!! Long short story..all the food I try there really GOOD!! (Kao soi kai,beef pad see ew,beef pad thai, shrimp drunken noodle,red curry,yellow curry,beef penang) you should try it so you know what is the real authentic food!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lotus of Siam over a dozen times; I can't believe I hadn't reviewed it yet! What is there to say about the restaurant that hasn't been said before? Who am I to argue with Jonathan Gold? 

The food here really is wonderful, I've tried all of their curries and different seafood dishes and everything was great. Admittedly, I like all Thai restaurants in La Vegas, but when you come here you can truly taste the difference, the flavors are more nuanced. The last time I came here the food was spectacular as always although the portion was a bit smaller than usual. 

This place is always packed yet we never wait forever 15-20 minutes for a table. The restaurant is always humming with energy and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves immensely."}
{"text":"This is the second location for Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. Their first location (on Sahara Ave) was recently damaged by water and will reopen in a few months. This new location (on Flamingo Rd.) opened just a couple of weeks ago. So new is it that they don't even have their liquor license yet - that will be coming in a couple of weeks.

When I arrived about 10 minutes after dinner service started there were already 18 people in front of me on the waiting list. However, I found out that I could be immediately seated at the bar and order from the full menu there. So the bar it was, which actually wasn't at all bad. When I left about 50 minutes later there were twice as many people waiting for a table as there were when I first arrived so getting served at the bar area may not work as well when it's really crowded here.

For an appetizer I had the Sum Thum (Papaya Salad), a very popular choice at most Thai restaurants. The shredded green papaya was perfectly accompanied by a mixture of chilis, lime juice and sugar. A fresh salad taste with a nice collection of flavors. I had asked for a spice level of 6 on a 10 point scale on my dishes and here the level was just about right, leaving just a slight chili spice feeling on my tongue after I finished. 

My main choice was the Khao Sai, a dish that has a protein on top of a bed of soft noodles along with some crunchy noodles, curry sauce, and some vegetables on the side. For proteins you can have chicken, beef, pork, shrimp with a slight upcharge, or crispy duck with a larger upcharge. I chose the duck and a good choice it was, nice sweet crispy exterior, soft well cooked interior, and just about the right amount of fat. The soft noodles and the crispy noodles were both excellent. The curry sauce showed speckles of chili oil and was good enough that I spooned up the rest of it after everything else was finished.

Service at the bar was excellent, prompt and friendly. All around, a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Sometimes you encounter a restaurant that knocks your socks off from out of the blue.  Lotus of Siam was not one of these establishments.  After hearing rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, J. Gold and that putu from Kevineats.com, I felt compelled to dine at what many have claimed to be \"The best Thai restaurant in North America\".  Dear readers, I think they may be onto something.

Ditching our group of friends, my Thai paramour and I courageously walked-in to the restaurant without a reservation and were quoted 1:30 wait for a party of two.  Luckily, mi corazon is as fluid in her native tongue as she is easy on the eyes and successfully flirted (right in front of the ignorant farang guests) our way into a table after only 15 minutes.  Yet another example of the eventual geopolitical power shift from the West to the Orient, suckaz!

This would prove to be an auspicious beginning to what would culminate in the best meal of our Vegas trip and quite possibly the year.  Unfortunately for us, we were only a party of two and we also had a pressing engagement at XS after dinner.  Because of this, we weren't able to order the full breadth of the menu (like garlic lobster and crab dishes) but we made do with:

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Issan Sausage)
Khao Soi (Egg Noodles in Coconut broth with chicken)
Crispy Duck with Penang Curry
Garlic Prawns
6 glasses (1 bottle plus 2 additional servings) of Prum 2009 Kabinett Riesling

As corazon expressed to me after the first few bites, this is as good as it gets outside of the homeland.  Granted, she remarked that the cuisine was a bit \"fusion\" and not within strict adherence to traditional Thai cusine, but she was nonetheless glowing with her praise.  As for your humble author, dear readers...  I was in Siamese heaven, fusion or no.

All of the dishes we ordered were excellent, with the Khao Soi and the Nam Kao Tod being my personal favorite.  In addition, the crispiness of the garlic prawns was perfectly married to the garlic infusion and the duck meat was SO juicy and provided a perfect (albeit extremely rich) counterpoint to the Penang curry.  All of the food went amazingly with the J Prum Riesling, a steal at $35 a bottle...

Maybe I had a few too many glasses of the aforementioned wine, because I distinctly remember in between bites whispering to my girlfriend that I wanted to have sex with her on top of all the sumptuous vittles.  Of course, being the modest Thai lady that she is, she shushed me and expertly directed my passions towards the food despite entreaties from your humble author for acceptance of, \"just the tip, sweetie...  come on, just the tip\".  \"OK, OK, later!\" she hissed at me.  What a saint, mi corazon...

Located in a semi-grimy strip mall, the location is nothing special, but the food was several notches above any Siamese cuisine I've had in the states.  Surprisingly, the service was very good as well.  Granted, I'm always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW's experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand's \"Land of Smiles\" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient.

Total bill came out to $123 for all that food and wine.  Officiously, I took out $25 in cash and gently put it in the payment tray.  

\"What, you're not going to pay for the rest of the meal?\" asked my now beleaguered (but very full) girlfriend.  

\"Just the tip, sweetie\" I replied slurring...  \"Just the tip.\""}
{"text":"This place is great!  The prawn  was delicious and well seasoned.  The server was polite knew his menu pretty well.  We took some of our clients and they all had a great experience.  We would definitely go back. Great food and drinks:)"}
{"text":"This place was a good place.  The crab rice was good and the prawn  was delicious.  Service was on point.  The dessert option was so tasty .  Although the restaurant was extremely busy, the service was consistent.  Very good and calm evening."}
{"text":"Back when Food Network was hyping this place up, it used to be a buffet. Lotus of Siam no longer has a lunch buffet but I decided to try it anyway. My wife and I ordered a papaya salad, tom yum shrimp and duck khao soi. 
Tom yum shrimp was decent, the sour and spice hit all the right notes but there was nothing to set it apart from other tom yum soups I have had.
The duck khao soi blew my mind. The soup of coconut curry tasted mellow with a perfect kick of sour and heat. The crispy duck exploded with flavor while providing textural contrast to the smooth soup and soft egg noodles. This dish cost $27 but it was totally worth it.
I would have given Lotus of Siam 5 stars if not for their papaya salad. The best papaya salad I have ever tasted came Chim! in Pasadena, CA. A proper papaya salad should complement sour and spice, smooth and crunchy, sweets and bitters. It should achieve perfect balance in its multiple opposing flavors. The papaya salad at Lotus of Siam goes overboard on the sour and bitter. Do not order their papaya salad!"}
{"text":"Hypebeast. L.O.S. was ok, but its not head and shoulders above other Thai I've had. We had the pad thai, stuffed chicken wings, drunken noodles, and garlic prawns. The garlic prawns were good and perfectly cooked, but the flavor was a bit lacking, I thought. The stuffed chicken wings were good, and the drunken noodles were actually amazing. Everything else was not really note worthy. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Taxi driver told us about it and it was pure bliss. Perfection. A total treat and so glad we went. We had the wings and duck curry and a few Thai iced teas. Glad I went for sure."}
{"text":"We've come here for dinner (very good), but the crowning jewel is the lunch buffet for $8.99, only offered on the weekdays. This is a small restaurant located in the Commercial Center (doesn't look like much outside, I know), but so many regulars come here, so this is a busy lunch buffet. On the walls are framed pictures of the owner/cook with various people (Mayor Oscar Goodman is one of them), as well as notable articles of recognition- numerous \"best of\" and such. 

You pay at the door, before getting seated. If there are already a number of diners in the restaurant, it could be a few minutes- but not more than 15 minutes. Service is pretty good. Drink orders are filled right away. The dirty plates are taken off your table pretty quickly. 

The buffet is not large, but it is high-quality. The yellow curry with tender chunks of potato and chicken is my husband's favorite- he said that he could drink the sauce with a straw. There are two or three stir fried dishes with a good mix of noodles, vegetables and chicken. Also on the menu: soup, salad, fruit, chicken wings, french fries, rangoons, dessert spring rolls (banana & coconut), jello squares, shrimp chips, and rice. I might be missing a few things- this is from memory."}
{"text":"I've read about the hype of this restaurant since my first visit here 6 years ago.  After moving here four years ago, I decided to give it a try.  My first visit was fairly good.  The place was packed.  The decor plain with tons of celebrities on the wall.

My second visit was probably two years ago.  I went with my boyfriend on a date night.  I decided to try some of the more interesting stuff, like tripe, etc.  Of course I was the only one eating these items as my boyfriend is a burger and fries kind of guy.  I think he ordered the Pad Thai.  I made him try a couple of bites.  I'm not sure what I ordered but it was good going down.

A perfect date is not complete without a walk by the Bellagio fountain, which I insisted on.  However, not ten minutes after dinner, I warned my boyfriend that we needed to find a bathroom NOW!  My stomach hurt so badly I was afraid I wasn't going to make it.  We stopped at the first bathroom after the Bellagio self-park as I sat on the toilet balled over in pain.  We walked through the casino and I ran into the bathroom again only minutes later.  We caught a quick fountain show and I ran into the bathroom again.  That's three trips in ten minutes.  I'm sure the security guards thought I had a different \"problem\".  After we made it home, my boyfriend finally got going and spent a good part of the night in the bathroom.  Talk about pain.

I'm not sure what I had eaten that had caused the upset stomach and, I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I will try it again but if I spend another night in the bathroom . . ."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. We waited about 1/2 hr. for a table. The food here is very good and there's an extensive wine list which is unusual for an Asian restaurant.
The only critique I have about this place is there are lots of wait staff buzzing around with ear buds and walkie talkies but we still got poor service.
FYI, portions are small"}
{"text":"I always remember Lotus of Siam as the first restaurant that I cried over the food, cried for about 15 straight minutes, because I underestimated the level of spiciness in my green papaya salad.  As a spicy food obsessive, this crying jag is a great memory, nothing negative of the sort.  My red-faced, drippy-nosed self was finally brave enough to get the wonderful server's attention, who removed the salad, and replaced it with a milder, uber-flavorful version...without us even requesting it and with no charge.  After ordering so-called \"Thai Hot\" for years from Thai restaurants in Indiana, I realized how much more authentically hot Thai food should be, thanks to Lotus.

We had walked from the Strip, underestimating the trek and how the surroundings were a bit creepy at night.  After going back and forth on flagging a cab, we finally made it to the strip mall and Lotus, and were able to be seated right away for dinner without a reservation.

Besides the burning hot Thai papaya salad, we split a delicious (cooling) bottle of Riesling. My dining partner ordered the whole catfish with sweet and sour sauce, and loved it. I had the red curry with tofu, with fresh basil and bamboo.  If you love Thai food, Lotus of Siam should be on your foodie wish list; escape the Strip and seek this place out.  And if I ever visit Las Vegas again, I hope to revisit with a larger group of co-diners...just so I could taste a larger variety of Lotus's authentic, truly wonderful dishes."}
{"text":"It does not get any better in Las Vegas! 
Their crab is to die for. It is a meal for two all by itself! 
Their pad thai is perfect. Their duck curry panang is special. Their Northern Pork Curry is craveable. What am I saying! Everything on their menu is good! There is a reason that chefs come here to eat when visiting Vegas! The word is out there that this is the best of the best. I've been going there since 2003 and never had a meal that wasn't magical!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the United States. Period! I am a Thai food snob. I have eaten Thai food all over the country. This little off-Strip restaurant is the real deal. 

They know me by name and they appreciate their loyal regulars. I let them order FOR me. I say make me the best you have tonight. They never disappoint! They fly their seafood in fresh and the chef is world class. I have heard directly from Top Chef Masters that every chef who comes tonVegas has this restaurant on their tour while in town. I believe it! 

Fav. Dishes: issan sausage, pad Thai, lobster, salmon with panang sauce, Tom yum soup, grilled prawns, anything on the special Northern Menu!"}
{"text":"I've been here before many times and decided to bring my parents for there anniversary but I got let down so bad and I almost felt embarrassed because a place I kept raving about gave us the worst service I've ever had. From 5 stars to two! Entered, got welcomed and helped right away. We sat at the bar and the bartenders staff was also very friendly. We then got seated and our server was no where to be seen. Waited for like 15 min and our busser finally gave us water. Then waited another 15 min and our server finally decided to do his job serve. We ordered our food finally. And then we waited. And waited. 45 min later our server didn't even come to give us an update or see if there is anything we needed. We asked the Busser who was honestly giving us more service \"how long until our food came out\" he said he will go check came out and said it's coming out right now. I'm just going to finish this review already by saying the food was amazing but the server then no longer was helping us he didn't even bring us the check some other random woman did and the busser is the one who asked if we wanted dessert. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Lotus was ok, but I'm comparing to the plethora of Thai food back at home, but that their spicy is mild to my palate and I was expecting something more.  Our party of four showed up on a Tuesday afternoon, seeking a change of pace. We ordered mostly from their northern-style Thai menu. 

Their Green chili dip was barely a tingle on my tongue, and I was expecting more of a bite and heat, when they warned us that it was spicy...

Their curry noodles was decent, as was their penang curry; but completely and utterly toothless in terms of spice.  And I'm not what you would call a hot head either. 

Skip the Tom Yum, since the base seems to be a chicken broth and not a true fish base and was missing the needed lemongrass in it... (was it because it was lunch and it was on the buffet?) 

The buffet looked ok, but how come it looked more like Chinese food and not Thai food? 

Their Thai iced tea was quite excellent, but their iced coffee was a tad too sweet.

I know this place gets rave reviews, but honestly, I don't think this is the best place to have Thai food, if you're seeking something with a bit of bite to it. I agree that the wine list is extensive, but definitely not a front-runner in my books for Best Thai of the year."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Thai restaurants across the US, and this is by far the best! The most interesting fact about Lotus of Siam, is the unassuming appearance of the restaurant from the outside. Located in a strip mall in a not-so-safe part of Vegas, the uninformed foodie could simply pass on the opportunity to indulge in the dining experience.

The Nam-Prik-Ong (Red Chili Dip) with vegetables and sticky rice is a great starter to any meal, and is the recommended dish by the great Ming Tsai.

Weekday lunch offers a great buffet at a reasonable price, and the wine list is top notch.

Take a walk on the wild side of Vegas, and head over to Lotus of Siam ASAP!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai Food restaurants in the United States.  

Shrimp Fried Rice, is especially good compared to other places but really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I love all the soups, but I personally get the Pad Prik Sod w/Chicken spicy level 9.  It is fire!!! So good.  

Too many good dishes to name."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The food is amazing! It's on the higher price, but if you know what to order, you leave satisfied and after all it is in Vegas, so you are there to spend some money. 

It was quick to get seated, check out for reservations if you go on busy hours and weekends. I went there on a Thursday, it was very busy but did not wait more than 10 minutes for my table. 

I ended up with an almost $50 pp bill but I ordered app, side and entree. So while I don't think it's the best value restaurant, for sure high traffic and good flavor I think it is worth it. I had some gambling surplus :) 

I'd be back every chance I get, but I like to try new ones too. Parking is the easiest as it sits at a strip mall on Sahara avenue somewhat close to SLS hotel."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food I've had stateside!!! It is amazing every aspect was awesome the food serviceatmosphere. I will be making weekly trips to lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"So good! I came here with my family for my grandma's 80th birthday weekend. It was a great place for a celebration but they food was amazing, I want to come here every time I'm in Vegas.

They have Americanized dishes in one section and Northern Thai dishes in another. We told the waiter what we like/dislike and to just bring us things, focusing on Northern Thai. The ones that stood out were the garlic prawns, crispy duck, and crispy rice. We never would have ordered garlic prawns but they were so flavorful and crunchy that they ended up being everyone's favorite. I remember those the most but really everything was so good. By far the best Thai food I've ever had.

They don't serve alcohol but they let you bring your own. We brought Thai beer and a couple bottles of champagne and I don't think we paid corkage but I could be wrong on that."}
{"text":"Lousy of Siam.  This place may have been worth trying when it was a small restaurant.  Now it is just a large tourist trap.  The place smells dirty, as are the bathrooms, with non functioning faucets.  The food is average at best.  The curries are ridiculously bad.  They are not curries, as they are just your selection of protein (chicken, or shrimp, or beef, etc.) quickly cooked in non-curry and then a curry sauce thrown on top.  So thus not curries.  They are curry sauce dishes.  All of our food came out cold.  We were seated in the third dining room (last dining room) and it was just a row of fold out tables lined row by row.  There were broken glass in the front windows with wood or cardboard boarding it up.  Service as fast and careless.  Overall a very lousy experience and extremely mediocre food.  Definitely not worth the effort or leaving the strip.   Don't buy into all the hype."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is considered by many to be the best and most authentic Thai food in America, and is a favorite of renowned chef Scott Conant. 

It's located on the north end of the Strip, and about a mile east. This makes for an easy cab ride. We made it there just before the lunch hours ended. That actually worked out well because it meant we had no wait time whatsoever. We decided to order several menu items and share, although it takes 10-15 minutes just to flip through the extensive menu. Everything sounded amazing, but we settled on the Issan Sausage, Kraphao Moo Krob, and Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab.

The Issan Sausage is their housemade grilled sour pork sausage (complete with a secret blend of ingredients), served with fresh chili, ginger, and peanuts. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this dish. There were hints of sweetness and acidity throughout, and each bite was packed with flavor.

I also loved the Kraphao Moo Krob, which is stir-fried crispy pork belly with Thai basils, bell peppers, and minced dry and fresh chilis. The pork belly was spectacular, and the thai basil added a great dimension to the dish. I only wish there had been more of it.

The Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab is a deep-fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil, served atop pan-fried flat rice noodles. We ordered the medium heat level, and that was just hot enough. It was very tasty, and I enjoyed the crispy crab coupled with the juicy noodles.

If you're looking for a fantastic lunch spot that won't break the bank, definitely try out Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best authentic Thai cuisine here in Vegas. Most times this place is packed, so you better call first to check if you can get a reservation. But its totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Referred to Lotus by the Best Things I've Ever Ate: Las Vegas. Pad Prik King, Nam Prik Ong, and Crispy Duck Panag with a bottle of white wine. The Pad Prik King is one of the best things I've ever ate. It is a small portion for the price but it is worth it. The Nam Prik Ong is almost the same thing but more of an entree and equally delicious. Crispy Duck Panag was not good. I love duck but the cognac sauce was overpowering. The wine was perfect. Restaurant has a comfy vibe, perfect for dates. The lighting is bright and there is just enough noise to be able to hear the person across from you. Service was good too. Make sure to make a reservation! We did and were seated immediately even though it was packed. Need...More..Pad Prik King!"}
{"text":"I always hear people namedrop Lotus of Siam when talking about Vegas Thai food. For me, I love Komol in the same business plaza, Commercial Center. I finally decided to check it out. We unwittingly showed up like 15 minutes early. We waited in the car and there was a line forming outside the restaurant. I thought, Holy crap, maybe this is the Holy Grail of Thai food. In Vegas. 

They had a buffet going on for lunch, but I wanted my first LOS experience to be a pure one. I copped a look at the buffet and it didn't look that great anyway. It looked kinda Chinese. 

The menu was large and had clear descriptions (in FOBese) of the items. And although you can make a lot of Thai meat dishes vegetarian, they did not have a section of the menu specifically for vegetarians. Like Komol. 

To start, we ordered the famous tom kah kai soup. It was really good, but really fattening, I think all it is is coconut milk, chili oil, and maybe chicken broth with bland chunks of chicken, straw mushroom, and cilantro (?). But I could sit there and drink the broth all day. You can get a cup, bowl, or hot pot. I think my cup was $4. 

We tried the panang just because I needed to compare and contrast to neighboring Komol's killer panang. I always get the tofu panang because I'm a part-time vegetarian (fair weather, really). LOS's panang was just like red curry. I don't know what's closer to original recipe, LOS or Komol's, but Komol's just tastes better. Its really robust and hearty. LOS's was really smooth and wussy. It just slipped off the tofu. 

We also got the steamed mussels. They steam it in fish sauce and basil leaves and give you a green chili lime dipping sauce which has even more fish sauce and is deceptively spicy. Just because it ain't red, don't mean it ain't spicy. It was really fishy. And the sauce was way too hot for me consume.

We got the sweet sticky rice dessert, which I think is normally supposed to come with mango, but they were 86 for the day. The dessert was good. Standard stuff. But the coconut milk was really thick and they garnished the rice with a crispy topping, like baked rice or something. That gave the texture a nice variation. 

Sorry, I don't have a cost breakdown of all the items, but for the two of us three entrees, two sticky rice, two drinks, and dessert, and some leftovers, our total bill was $53 before tip. Not bad, I guess. Holy crap, we did eat a lot ... Our entrees ranged $8-15. 

The restaurant has a homey kind of ambiance. The ceiling is low and the walls are decorated with Thai things and pictures of the proprietress (I'm guessing) and guests. I like the way the restaurant is sectioned. It keeps the noise down. 

By the time we were done with our meal, the restaurant was packed and the buffet was wrecked. 

I appreciate this place. Their menu is impressive, the food and service was good, it was clean, and prices were decent, but I'd pick Komol over Lotus of Siam. Komol hits the same points, but their panang is better. Haha. 

I think I'll come to like it more when I find the super great items on the menu.

(To date, Lotus of Siam has 120+ reviews and Komol has 7.)

{"text":"Visitor Notice - this is not some place I think I would have ever have gone had I not been taken here by a lovely local. Located in a bit of a gritty strip center. The physical space is an odd amalgamation of upscale pretension and church recreation room with a nifty wine cellar thrown in. Maybe this is a hidden gem for \"out of towners\"; but it was certainly packed on a recent Saturday visit. Though the bar area was wide-open.

The food is awesome - everything I tried was exceptional and worthy of 5 stars. The stuffed chicken wing is the BEST - it is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and deep fried! What's not to love....Other favorites were garlic shrimp (the shells were the best part) and the crispy duck. My dining companion enjoyed her uber large bowl of noodle goodness. Great selection of German Riesling wines with some very rare finds at fair prices. The service is a bit spotty and I had to flag down some one on a few occasions. Let's hope the tourists don't find out about this place and we can keep it our little naughty dining secret.

Looking forward to my next visit to the Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Love the food! The menu is huge and the wine selection is even bigger!"}
{"text":"Long wait. The food is quite good. We ordered curry, salad and crispy shrimp. The crispy shrimps was good but overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is really as great as everyone says. There is no hype - except maybe the prices are higher than one expects for a Thai restaurant, but it's seriously worth it. You don't come here to eat your usual \"pad thai\" or \"pad see ew.\" If you order the usual suspects and are disappointed, then that is YOUR failure. 

This place is SUPER busy. They do take reservations, although I'm not sure how one is able to make a reservation. Arriving here a few minutes after they open, there was a huge line out the door already, and we still waited for about an hour for a table of three. It's worth the wait. Seriously. I wish there was a Lotus of Siam in the Bay Area. 

Like everyone says, get the Crispy Duck Kha Soi - don't order the \"basic\" version. If you do, you'll ask, what's the big deal. To which I will respond, you have reading comprehension - Crispy Duck. Also order the garlic crispy prawns O-M-G. I just need a bucket of those, my favorite show, and I'll be snacking them like potato chips while I veg out on my sofa. I love that they separate the meat and the shell, but still attached. And it's all a giant crunch and flavor to your face. 

There are other great items on the menu, but those are the two I HIGHLY recommend. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The hubs was right ~ the best Thai food ever.  

The restaurant is unassuming from the outside, but once you step in the doors, a nice wine cellar is the backdrop for the hustle and bustle of a wonderful establishment.  

Friendly service.  Super flavorful dishes and moist, tender meats.  

We ordered: 
- Crispy Rice appetizer - spicy and sour.  Puckering.  Party in my mouth.
- Beef Salad - tender beef slices on tasty greens
- Chicken Skewers - so dainty and tender.  Not your average chicken skewer.
- Duck Curry - tender and lightly crisp duck pieces over noodles with curry.  Star of the show. 

All delicious.  Very, very good.

Thanks, Lotus of Siam ~ you guys rock!"}

The regular Thai food like Pad Se Ew and Panang Curry was ok, but not memorable like the Prawns. We  went here recently and had amazing service, friendly staff and was very knowledgeable on the many and many kinds of Japanese Sake they had. The Banzai Bunny is a blueberry sake that is my favorite sake ever. All of the sake is pricey though.. A definite must try!

The place is actually pretty busy. They a small waiting area, reviews and pictures of celebrities all over the restaurant that has dined at Lotus of Siam.

The place is in the boonies of Vegas, but once you enter the restaurant and eat the food, you can see why people would go here."}

We got there right when it opened and were greeted by extremely friendly staff members who were radio'd up and ready to serve us a delicious dinner.  You don't wait for refills on drinks and they talk with you as if you have known them forever.  Again, blown away!

The food is tasty, well priced and they have a better wine cellar then most LV restaurants!

This place will bring a smile to your face when you enter so give them a try :)."}

:: TO-GO ORDER EXPERIENCE ::

We were pressed for time and had decided to do To-Go pick up on a Sunday. Restaurant doesn't open until 5:30 PM but we called ahead anyways at 5:15 PM to give it a shot. Even though we were able to place our order they do tell you kitchen does not open until 5:30 PM. 
When we got to the restaurant (located in a pretty run down/sketchy looking strip mall) there were already a line out the door!  

Entrance to the restaurant was so TINY -- to get in you pretty much have to go in a single file line (where there is alot of people). You also have to wait in the same line even for To-Go orders! Due to the mad line we didn't pick up our To-Go order until 5:50 PM. But the gal at the front counter was very nice.  Regardless, IMO they should have a separate To-Go line or something :P

:: RESTAURANT INTERIOR ::

The interior was pretty big! I couldn't even tell from the outside. Upon entrance into the establishment there is a wine cellar display and to the very right of the venue is a bar where patrons can wait for their table to be called. The atmosphere was nice and décor was decent. A say a bit to much celebrity photos covering the walls left & right. It's a very casual dining establishment & away from the glitz & glam of the Vegas strip. 

:: FOOD ::

Prices here are seriously a bit steep for Thai food.  But due to the hype we tried it out anyways. For AMAZING damn good food I'll pay for it -- of course when my wallet allows it :P

CRISPY DUCK W/ PANANG  $24    (4.5/5)
-- Portion kind of small for the price. Hence the minus 0.5 star. Duck was definitely crispy & there were no bones! The panang curry was delicious! But i wished they gave more tho :P 

SUA RONG HAI   $18   (3.5/5)
-- Aka the \"Crying Tiger.\" Generous charbroiled beef portion but something about the charbroiled taste of the beef was a little off/different or maybe this is the true taste of a Crying Tiger? The home-made spicy sauce was not so bad but not much tang to it. 

CRAB FRIED RICE   $14   (2.5/5)
-- There really were HARDLY any crab pieces in this fried rice. Tasted like regular fried rice. Definitely not worth the price. You're probs better off with the regular Thai fried rice for cheaper.

THAI ICED COFFEE   $2.50   (3/5)
-- My taste bud didn't quite love it but found it not bad... something was lacking. Maybe it's just me?!"}

There was a vast array of items on the menu and I doubt any of them is not cooked to perfection.  I had the bambo curry with the Thai tea, the curry was spicy but delicious and the tea had to be the best I had so far.  I would recommend for anyone to go there if they want to enjoy some true Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is classic, old school Vegas with all of the memorabilia and movie star photos on the walls. It was also featured in Anthony Bourdain's Vegas feature. The food is really good but I wouldn't say phenomenal. I think the draw is the history more than the food."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! The chicken wings stuffed with pork and fried duck curry egg noodles were amazing!"}
{"text":"this is such a piece of jewel in the desert island. We came here after watching parts unknown, and the restaurant does live up to the reputation. Food is extremely out of the league, the portion is moderate while fulfilling, and we got to see the chef as well. Highly recommended. 
For visitors:
- dinner starts at 5:30 on weekend, but it's always lined up with customers 15min prior to 5:30.
- they take reservation 2-3 weeks ahead of time.
- it's like 20 USD by cab from strip."}
{"text":"Parking in the back.  Don't let the street side presentation scare you off. fried garlic shrimp and drunken duck noodles are both very good, but I would recommend going more at 12:30 than when they just open.   no 1/2 orders so you'll have to commit to the full entree order.  Recommended to go with a group of more than 3 or 4."}
{"text":"I should start by mentioning that this place won the James Beard Foundation Award this year for Best Chef within it's region. With accolades like that, I tend to have high expectations.... Expectations that were not met.

When you arrive at Lotus of Siam, it looks just like every other Thai restaurant found in any old town. It appears to be made up of several converted spaces that makes it feel like a Bingo hall. There are water damage stains on the ceiling where crystal chandeliers from the early 80's hang under fluorescent lights. Dusty framed pieces of art depicting elephants drawn with sequins adorn the walls. It really couldn't be any more of a cliche. Then there was the menu. Inundated with over 150 items, I was enormously overwhelmed by the task at hand. Luckily, the website lists a number of recommendations within each course. So we went with the Koong Sarong or \"Prawn in Blanket.\" This dish featured marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and wonton wraps, deep fried, and served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Was it good? Of course! It was amazing! But what isn't when wrapped in bacon and deep fried. The prawns were done just right and the sauce balanced out the heaviness of the wonton nicely.

They say that the true test of a brilliant chef is to order the simplest menu item and see how they are able to make it their own. It seemed like a reasonable challenge, but not so much that night. I went with my old standby Pad Thai and couldn't wait to see what Chef Saipin Chutima would do. Unfortunately, I was sadly underwhelmed. The dish tasted okay, but I had seen this dozens of times before. It was by no means a revelation. In fact, it was overly oily and too sweet. My companions ordered Charbroiled Beef which was very grisly, and while the Sweet and Sour Chicken was nice and fresh, the use of cilantro was overpowering and just too much. It could very well be that we just did not order the right menu items. But in my opinion, any item coming out of such a heralded kitchen should be cooked to perfection. 

My advice: save up and splurge at a \"Strip\" restaurant such as Shibuya at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. It will cost a bit more but the experience will be worth it. My lesson learned: every dining experience and plate is different. Critically acclaimed restaurants do not always deliver as you would like them to."}
{"text":"Came here to see what the hype was about. Omg, waited for 2 hours, if you want to RSVP, you need to do that in2 to 3 days advance. Food is pricy & it is ok. Presentation was nice. They have a nice collection of wine. Beside that, that the best Thai food I have had."}
{"text":"SO AUTHENTIC WILL GO AGAIN. Get northern thai food because that's her specialty!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friends birthday dinner.. ill be honest, definitely not a place i would venture on my own had it not been of someone else's suggestion. Upon coming here i was thinking to myself... Thai food in vegas? Why? Why now a steak house? Or buffet? Whats so special about this place?

It opens at 5:30 for dinner... & boy, we got there at 5:15ish & there was already a line outside waiting for the doors to open. Good thing we made reservations for our party of 18 or else it wouldve been a total nightmare.

Lets get to the food, EVERYTHING I HAD THAT NIGHT WAS AMAZING!!!! Just really tasty stuff, now i can totally understand the high reviews and waits for Lotus of Siam.

Fyi incase you were planning to come here to a big party, there will be a minimum price point you will need to it, but hitting that price was relatively easy if you include drinks and desserts.

Definitely add this to your bookmark if you havnt already!!"}
{"text":"Most foodies know about the legendary Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. All I can say is this...the curry here (specifically the Panang) is BY FAR the most exquisite Thai curry I have ever had. The nuance, the balance and subtlety of the flavors is incomparable. I've never had anything I didn't love and I've been going here for almost 15 years, but the Panang curry is truly a masterpiece of culinary excellence."}
{"text":"Great Thai food for North America. Aside from the typical curry, Lotus of Siam has great selection of food and offers great value. Love Tom Yum soup and the sticky rice with mango dessert. Efficient servicke and great value, we silled ourselves for 37$ per person."}
{"text":"As Thai cuisine goes this is not your ordinary Thai restaurant, so be prepared to order a little differently than you might otherwise do. There are items on this menu that are absolutely magical, and are best eaten at a 7-8 level of heat. They are the Crispy Duck with Cream Cognac sauce, the Soft Shell Crap Salad, the Tom Kah Kai soup, and the Spicy Catfish with basil leaves. 

They have an incredible wine list with lots of depth including  many Riesling flights. Rieslings pair marvelously with spicy Thai. They have even brought samples to the table to help us decide which to chose.The proprietor is well known in town for his cellar, and his markups are very reasonable. It's also a pleasant surprise to have wine presented so elegantly in this location (just as one would expect in a Michelin rated establishment.) 

As for the dishes you would order in other Thai restaurants such as Larb, and Pad Thai - stay away from them - this is not the place. Be prepared to wait unless you make reservations the day before. Being locals, we expect a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"The claim that this is the best Thai food outside of North America is no exaggeration. Fourish years ago I visited Thailand for a school sponsored trip and have been searching for decent Thai food ever since in the states and have failed miserably time and time again.  Every restaurant either lacks spice in their food (which is absolutely essential for this cuisine) or is simply way too greasy for consumption. But Lotus of Siam's dishes are nice and spicy, fresh, and well prepared. Even better, there are items on this menu that I have not seen anywhere else since I've been back from Thailand. When I was there I ordered the beef jerkey as an appetizer, sea bass, and sticky rice for dessert. All were very tasty, and I must mention that the sea bass literally melted away in my mouth. All in all I am very glad I came here during my trip in Vegas. Totally worth the cab ride (its off the strip) but only five minutes away. 

As a sidenote though, MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION. Even in the middle of the week they are completely packed for dinner and lunch. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"It's located in a remote location off the strip where one can imagine drug dealing/prostitution can certainly takes place behind the restaurants along this plaza. All the restaurant's windows were all shaded and hard to tell who/what goes on inside. My friend's first impression was to GTFO of this parking lot and eat in our hotel where there are plenty of lights and people which \"guaranteed\" safety lol. But in the end, we went in and ate.

The first thing I've noticed were the numerous pictures of celebrity chefs and celebrities along the wall including chefs as such Ming Tsai and even that Andrew zimmern from Travel Channel.  With that in mind and the popular reviews on yelp this place have to be good, then again Mr. zimmern eats anything and everything. We were told the wait was 1 hour and we were willing to wait. 

As my two friends and I were waiting, one of them got so hungry from the thought that he was not able to eat within the hour he went to the next door Indian restaurant to eat a small meal lol. 

The GOODS:
The wait was NOT an hour, it was around 30 minutes. We got the crispy duck and two more dishes which I have forgotten the names but everything was LEGIT TO THE MAX. One of the dishes was some sort of braised beef in a curry sauce. The waiter asked us how spicy do we want our food from the scale of 1-10 and we said 5 and to my taste buds, the chefs made it RIGHT ON. The service was excellent and I can not complain much about this establishment."}
{"text":"I recently visited Las Vegas for a week and was told by multiple sources that this was the place to go.  

We called at around 7pm on a Tuesday to make a reservation for the same night and was told that they do not take same day reservations and it fully booked for the night but if we were to do a walk-in the wait was 20 minutes. I am from New York, a 20 minute wait for ANY type of food is considered fast. When we arrived there was no one in the waiting area except my friends and I. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait by the lady at the register until a waitress walked by and told us to follow her. I am pretty confident I know what a fully booked restaurant looks like because when I looked around, it sure wasn't it. There were literally 5 tables out of say 30 that were occupied. Rule #1: Don't lie, it just makes you look really bad.

As for the food: We ordered Pad se-ew, drunken noodles with crispy duck, green curry with chicken, seafood chili and basil leaves, and two orders of sticky rice. The sticky rice was lukewarm, hard, and not the usual glutinous texture. The noodles for the pad se-ew were good but the dish was fairly bland. The flavor of the green curry with chicken was great but it left us wondering where the chicken was. The \"slices\" were almost as if they were minced. The seafood chili and basil leaves was, for the lack of a better word, awkward. The flavor of the dish did not penetrate the seafood. Besides the initial flavor upon biting, the rest of the seafood tasted as if it was boiled in plain water. The best tasting of our dishes was the drunken noodles with the crispy duck but even this had issues. There were approximately 4 pieces of duck and enough noodles to feed 1.5 people. Even though it was advertised as \"crispy\" the skin of the duck was soggy. 

Overall, with this being our last meal in Vegas, we were sorely disappointed. As great as our vacation was, we wanted to end it on a high note by going to a place that others have claimed to have a \"cult following.\" I am sorry to say that for my friends and I, Lotus of Siam does not belong on the pedestal everyone has placed it on."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food! My friend assures me that this is the best Thai food in the United States. Maybe it is. I wish that we had ordered something more dramatic. I saw other tables with stuffed whole fish and soup made at the table.what we had was perfectly prepared, but ordinary Thai dishes like penang and beef stir fry."}
{"text":"Crazy throngs of people in this decrepit old strip mall. Delicious food and they serve a huge amount of tables at a time so the intimidating line before they open all get seated. 

Best Thai in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is usually one if the restaurants that I bring Family and Friends from out of town. It's kind of a \"secret\" restaurant. Don't let the exterior fool you. The inside is very clean and really \"elegant\" looking. The portions are kind of on the small side, but still very satisfying. I would of have given 5 stars but the portion sizes kind of upset me. When we go out to eat, we are celebrating and usually don't want to worry about portion sizes. Other than that, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Over Hyped that's what my boyfriend said. He's Thai and he said the food was just okay. It was good but wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Thank you Leo C. for a fabulous restaurant recommendation. When entering, awards from Gourmet magazine, best of las vegas, cabbies choice, newspaper articles align the walls. My expectations were raised a bit higher. Wow, did this place deliver. 

The menu is in a form of a book and it takes about 20 mins. to read through and make very important dining decisions. I would highly suggest dining with a large party so you're able try all of the restaurant specialties and the Chef's choice's.

It was just the two of us and we must of looked famished because we ordered half the menu. It was my last dinner in sin city and I wanted to win the gold medal of gluttonous overkill.

We ordered the crispy duck panang. Holy shit this is fcking awesome. The salt and pepper prawns with drunken noodles. Huge mutherfcking prawns, delicious. Spicy thai beef jerky, they need to bag this and sell it to cowboys. YUM. Fried chicken wings sauteed in garlic. Yes Yes Yes. A cold beef salad with lime, very refreshing. Crab fried rice and softshell crab curry. Why don't all thai places serve food like this? Chicken pad thai, this dish I didn't care for, I've had better. The quality of the food is by far better than any other thai place I've been to. The menu is very diverse, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get away from the same standard fare that the casino's have to offer.

5 amazing stars."}
{"text":"Wow! This has got to be one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to! And this is coming from a girl who has been to the \"good Thai places\" in Hollywood aka Thai-town. I have to say at first I was skeptical because the exterior looked like the run down part of downtown LV but all that changes once you step inside the restaurant...what Thai restaurant has a glass wine cellar? The wait (good sign) was about 30 min: long enuff for us to look over the menu to decide what we wanted to try. When we saw what was brought out to other tables, the food looked so good that we had to change what we were going to order to what we saw! We were definitely getting more excited as the time drew nearer...
I know that at Asian restaurants, a bunch of white people is usually not a good sign because that means that the food might not be authentic and made \"Americanized\". It was a packed house with about 50% white folks.. Got me a lil worried, but boy this time, the white folks must've known something the Asian population wasn't aware of... Rundown of our dishes:
1) Tom Kum kah: coconut soup. Was ok. Nothing special.
2) Garlic prawns: highlight of the evening. The seasoning was the perfect balance of salt, garlic, and pepper. The exact seasoning you would expect if you order Chinese style stir fried garlic crabs. The most surprising part of the dish was how it was prepared: with the prawn shelled but with the shell semi- attached at the tail. First, you eat the perfectly seasoned prawn. Then, you got to enjoy the bonus: the crispy prawn shell. Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin). I have never seen prawn prepared this way. WHY hasn't any other chef/ restaurant ever thought of that?!!! Lotus of Siam, thank you for this ingenious foresight......

3) crispy duck in panang curry: we had originally planned to order the crispy duck with Chili n mint leaves, but our waiter suggested we order this version since we already had a similarly flavored dish. What great knowledge of the staff to provide helpful tips! He was dead on to make this suggestion. My friend krystal kept raving about the sauce. I think if she was not in public, she may have licked the plate!! LoL!!!

4) drunken noodle with sea bass: at first we contemplated ordering this dish.. It was the most expensive thing we ordered at $30, but we were sold when a patron leaving the restaurant overheard our discussion and urged us to order it saying it was \"the reason why we come here\". With a reference put that way, we needed no further convincing! The sea bass was extremely fresh n flaky. The drunken noodles were perfectly wok'd: you could taste the \"fire\" of the wok. A sign that the wok has been well seasoned and the chef knows how to use that to intensify the foods being cooked in it. Awesome dish!

Alas, we were too full to order dessert but the fried bananas with ice cream looked so good that we'll have to come back next time to try it. Oh YES, there will definitely be a NEXT time.. :)

Total for our party of 4: $103. Not bad at all.. I'd come here any day over a buffet!!"}
{"text":"Busy place so make reservations for sure!! The food and service is awesome! This place is located in a strip mall for over 40 years."}
{"text":"Ordered Som Tom (green papaya salad) excellent, just top notch flavor!  Had to order garlic prawns...and its pretty much the best thai food i have had in vegas...my only regret is not eating here in day 1 of our vacation...next trip will include multiple visits to Lotus of Siam"}
{"text":"This is absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST Thai restaurant I have ever been to.  It is an absolute treasure and NEVER disappoints.  Throughout my years traveling to Vegas, I've Never had a less than perfect meal at Lotus.  
MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"You are luck if you get in to have dinner... reservations are hard to come by and only on the phone and phone is only answered during business hours. Even though it may be difficult to get in, it is sooooo worth it! Fabulous Thai food! It is a must restaurant to visit in Las Vegas! Everything we have ever ordered was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Well apparently, just a couple of weeks after my visit this place is closed due to a roof collapse. Nonetheless, they deserve a review.

I like to play the where-did-Anthony-Bourdain-go? game whenever I am travelling and so Lotus of Siam has been on my list for awhile, but surprisingly it's been probably over 6-7 years since my last Vegas trip.

The menu is extensive, so don't waste your time with the Pad Thai's and Pineapple fried rice and flip right to the Northern Thai section, because according to the master (aka Anthony Bourdain), their Northern Thai food is authentic. I was delighted with the Khao Soi, which is a soupy noodle dish. I got it with beef and the tangy flavor of the soup with a tiny spicy kick (I ordered medium but it was more like barely mild) and the sweetness of the coconut really was delicious. It came with some pickled veggies, which were also fantastic. I also ordered the Thum Ka Noon, which is shredded and ground pork with jack fruit. The initial bite was salty, but once you learn that it should be scooped with rice (and I recommend ordering sticky rice), then it was heavenly. The balance of the complex flavors in their dish made it hard to put down my chopsticks. I also loved the play on textures with the shredded pork, which was stringy and drier v. and ground pork, more saucy and softer.

Hopefully they open up again soon because I'd rather eat here than other places on the strip."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Lotus of Siam from a trusted recommendation, and it was 100% spot on! We were warned that we should get a reservation, but luckily lunch was not as busy and we were seated right away (we also learned dinner reservations were COMPLETELY booked).

Don''t let the parking lot and outside fool you. This place is a real gem!

Garlic prawns - AMAZING. Large and juicy, and somehow the skin is removed except at the tail, which forms kind of like a potato chip. This was our favorite dish.

Crispy duck with chili leafs - also excellent. Duck was very meaty and flavorful. 

The two dishes above were a bit pricey at $24-27ish each, but it was definitely well worth it!"}
{"text":"Probably the most upscale thai restaurant right outside the vegas strip. Surprised to know that they take reservations and their signature dishes are hard to recreate.

Interior
Might think of it as hole in the wall place but the walls has been decorated with pictures of celebrity and famous chefs that visited this place. To put the cherry on top, you can't miss the glass window wine cellar right in the middle of the restaurant filled with great selections of wines and sakes.

Food
We asked our server to select two of the bestsellers and he recommended garlic prawns and crispy duck in panang curry. It definitely hit the spot, as in, when you don't know what to eat and feel like being adventurous and finding a hidden gem. Portion was perfect for two people and I WILL come again to try other dishes.

Service
Very courteous, easy going, makes you smile and feel comfortable, can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas over the weekend and came to Lotus of Siam two days in a row. After seeing several articles, an Anthony Bourdain episodes, and a James Beard elect (2011) award- I could not wait to try it. 

So I was lucky enough to go twice here over the course of the weekend. I went Saturday (5:30PM- opening time) & Sunday 6PM, both without reservations. At opening, you may see a massive line, but it moves fast and you get a seat almost right away. If you wait a half hour, the wait bumps up to 1 hour. So either get a reservation or go right when it opens. 

After coming here twice, I have to give Lotus of Siam all around compliments:

1) The staff-  they are very friendly and amazingly fast.   If you are in a rush , you can go from seating to check in 30 min. But at the same time, if you are enjoying yourself and chatting, they do not rush you. 

2) The management's ethics- While I was waiting for a table on Sunday, about six 60+ year old customers (not sure which European country they hailed from) came in and seemed highly annoyed about an hour wait. Those of us patiently waiting (which included grandparents and children) watched as one man in the group pulled out a wad of cash,and tucked $40-60 dollars in his palm to bribe the staff for a table. This guy continued to haggle with the staff for about 10 minutes. But the staff continued to decline his bribe and did not let him skip ahead of anyone. They gained a huge amount of respect from me and the the other dinner's who saw these events play out.

3) The food- Delicious and extremely well priced. Now I enjoy a really spicy meal and want to roll my eyes when people ask me \"are you SURE you want spicy...it's really spicy!\"  I usually like it as hot as it comes. But something made me feel like the food was going to be authentic here so I went \"medium spice.\" For me this was perfect, enough to tingle the lips and make the nose run a little, but not too much to make me chug a glass of milk. If you cannot handle spice, go well below medium.

Appetizers I tried: 
-Golden Fried Tofu (like any other place, good but nothing unique)
-Nam Kao Tod (Small dish but packed with spice and flavor, really loved this)

Dishes I tried: 
-Chili & Basil Seafood combo (delicious with rich basil flavor, good kick to it too)
- Pad Se Ew (basic dish but well made)
-Thum Ka Noon (Rich, spicy dish with jackfuit but not heavy at all, one of my favorites)
- Kang Hung Lay (sweet and spicy pork curry, heavier dish but packed with flavor)

Dessert: 
-Mango and sticky Rice (basic dish but really fresh mango and rice was not dried, delicious!)


This place was great and will be a must on future Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has an impressive amount of great reviews on Yelp so we had to try it out on our last visit to Vegas. Love the food but the prices are pretty ridiculous & so is the wait. This place is located in a sketchy shopping center. From the outside, it doesn't look like much but the interior is really nice. The wine cellar is pretty impressive. 

~ papaya salad - after trying Laos style papaya salad, Thai style papaya salad everywhere tastes bland to me & the one here is no exception :(
~ crispy duck curry - pricey but it is pretty good
~ pad Thai - decent but small portion"}
{"text":"Ok, this place has been hyped like crazy.  All over TV.  Chowhound raves.  James Beard awards, etc...  Can it live up to the hype?  YES. YES. YES.

This place was awesome.  We went a little aggressive ordering for 2 but we went with:

Crispy Rice w Sour Sausage
Sea Bass w Drunken Noodle
Garlic Shrimp
Kang Ka Noon (Spicy Young Jack Fruit Curry)

I'd say they were all 5 star dishes except maybe the Kang Ka Noon, which was a 3.5 star dish.  Needless to say, I'll be back here for sure.  This place just earned a spot next to Oyster Bar on my list of must-eats-on-vegas-stops.

The wait for a Saturday night for 2 at 6:30p was 45 min. Me and my coworker had a beer at the bar while waiting... not too bad a wait at all."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. Its in a strip mall, in vegas, off strip. 

When you walk in, it feels like a mom and pop place. And by and large, it is. There's one difference. There are James Beard awards hanging on the wall. 

The setting is not pretentious. The food is all together different from what american Thai has become. Its personal to the chef. The locals will tell you that she is from the Southern part of Thailand, so order from the Southern section of the menu. I did. It was unreal.

Only complaint is that the portion size was a little small. Or that's their way of putting 10-15$ price tags on dishes and making the same as $20-25 places on the strip... either way, I didn't care in the end. I would have ordered more, and I will go back.

I love that its off strip, and that the people who know about it have made the intentional trip to find out what its all about. Those who do pay the cab fare and make the trip are rewarded."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It doesn't look fancy on the outside, but as soon as you walk in it's obvious people know there's great food here! The place was busy, and was much bigger inside than it looked on the outside. The food was delicious, and they had a wide variety of authentic Thai food on their menu. The service was wonderful! We ordered many different entrees to share, and it was all scrumptious! The presentation was beautiful, too. We ordered some desserts, too, which were all great!"}
{"text":"So of course I had to check out what all the hype was about! The food was absolutely amazing. There was so much to choose from, we ended up going with a few of the servers suggestions. We had the nua Nam tok (beef dish) Tom kah kai (coconut soup)kao soy (curry w/ egg noodle) and a pad thai. The flavors were rich and definitely authentic. I appreciate this restaurant stays true to thai ingredients. My only complaint was the portions were slightly small, but other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here. It was Delicious and perfectly well seasoned. We ordered the garlic prawns, drunken noodle with sea bass, tom yum soup, and laos style papaya salad. Also got the coconut ice cream for dessert since they were out of mango sticky rice. Can't imagine going anywhere else for Thai food now. They have a big selection of wine as well."}
{"text":"Meh.  Everyone raves about Lotus of Siam and I think it's good, but I don't think it's great.   It's expensive, crowded and loud.   I would rather eat Thai elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thursday was my first time here and it was a great experience. We ordered prawns, curry and seafood basil.  Food and service were great. I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have a painful experience I would like to share but first, let me get my order out of the way. I had ordered the red curry and the nam prik ong. It was quite well actually. For my birthday, I'd thought to treat my family to a place I've heard extensive publicity about. All of the reviews and pictures seemed to give it proper accolades so it was a must to eat there. We only waited 15 minutes, they sat us down, and we looked through the menu. We ordered our dinner, talked amongst each other about what we did during the day, and we waited. Once the food was out, the aroma made us happy and we began to eat. I thought the nam prik ong was supposed to arrive first like how I asked but I can eat it after my red curry. We ate slowly and still talked amongst each other. It was going well until we seen the servers standing by us, asking if we were done with our meals. Obviously if you stop eating to chat, the assumption of you being done seems questionable. But these welcoming men turned into vultures, constantly asking if we were finished. Their smiling demeanor turned into angst that made everyone uncomfortable. I took my time to finish my meal while they where practically begging us to ask for the check. I finished my red curry but I was still waiting for my nam prik ong. The server who took my order asked if he could clean the table while I surfed the web for places to go after. He asked politely if I can scoot over so they could rearrange the tables too. My family is waiting outside and I'm waiting for my other half that I ordered. I finally ask the man about it and he seemed hazed as if I was the one who decided to order at that very last minute. He even insisted on pulling out my chair so I could leave but I told him directly again about my order. I can see the sweat on his forehead as he wrote it down again. While I waited again, I can see everyone else was having a different experience. I saw the beautiful menu throughout the restaurant from what people had ordered. And I saw the money hungry people who run the place. I never want to feel like there's a price on my head again. I never ever want the servers to make it obvious that they're \"losing money\" because of our warmth as a family to chat amongst each other. I ate the red chili dip and left. My question is, how much did they pay you Anthony Bourdain and Action Bronson? How much did they pay you to say those kind words? That this is one of the greatest places to eat in Las Vegas. I hate this place. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Loyal Yelpers came through again for me when I was looking for an ethnic lunch option in Vegas. Away from the hustle of The Strip, I was thankful to take a break from the crowds and the ever-present smell of burning pot along Las Vegas Boulevard to come to a little strip mall housing this place with its own parking lot. From the outside, it has a slightly modern look and once we stepped in, it was apparent that this was a somewhat upscale Thai restaurant. They did not balk at my tourist wear or shorts and flip flops but beware that most of the people dining here at the lunch hour were business types in business casual or better clothing. I felt somewhat out of place. I was hoping for a Thai street cafe feel but found a dining room that could have fit right in at a 5 star hotel. That luxury is the trade off for portion size/price. 

The servers were on us immediately. One thing I noticed, in addition to the modern, warm wood interior, was that there was a very high server:patron ratio. Their bus and wait staff were buzzing around constantly filling water glasses, clearing tables, etc. I also noted the chef to be out among the diners at times proudly in her chef whites interacting with people. I am used to the true Thai business model of 20 tables, 1 server, and an invisible chef that is probably dying slowly behind a flaming wok buried in a kitchen and this was the inverse of that. They clearly are wanting this place to set the bar a bit higher and they succeed in doing so. I even had a coat and tie manager stop over to check on us during our meal to ensure everything was in order. 

They also seem to do a brisk bar business. It was nice to see them making efforts at really having a nice beer and wine list for pairing. I noted several tables around me that were several wine bottle deep into their meal and the wine service was excellent from their staff. 

The menu was fairly extensive and they deserve to be recognized for that. Most Thai places in America have short menus with mainly Western palate favorites. The menu here is all of that plus a lot more including many harder to find items that I really have only had in Thailand. I loved that they had things such as Issan Sour Sausages (Sai Krok) and charred liver (Tub Wharn) available. I also noted several Thai and Asian patrons in the place which I took to be a good indicator of authenticity.

I am holding to 4 stars primarily because the pricing was a bit high for the portion size in my opinion. I'm sure that is because the overhead for the more upscale interior and the number of service staff is high and I can appreciate the business model. However, from my time spent in Thailand, that business model is rare and I would prefer a more casual atmosphere with the same food quality. Don't get me wrong, this place was great and I highly recommend it but I would love to see them open up a small, more casual outpost with the same food reminiscent of some of the greatest street meals I've had in Thailand."}
{"text":"if you want to find a good, cheap meal in vegas, skip all the crappy and crowded buffets with enormous lines and head on over to lotus of siam. in fact, if you want just a downright awesome meal irregardless of price, go to lotus of siam. this place beats any of the michelin-stared restaurants on the strip. why? because it's damn good and damn authentic. and you can get away from the cluttered strip for a second which is always a welcome change of pace.

our experience here was nothing but spectacular. our waitress knew just want to recommend. the wine list is good and when i asked her to recommend a good reisling, she picked just the right one for me. not too sweet, not too dry. just perfect. then when it came time to order, we told her what we wanted and she offered up modifications based on the various sauces of the entrees we ordered. she wanted to ensure we didn't get the same sauces and that we picked the best meat/fish with the dish. thusly we ended up with a very comprehensive meal.

roasted duck curry
drunken noodles with chicken
charbroiled prawns
pad sw ew with seabass
poached salmon with chiles

my favorite of the lot was the roasted duck curry but all were amazing. i have boasted that my favorite thai food ever is thai tom in seattle (check out the reviews of that place if you care to understand the comparison), but this place MAY have surpassed thai toms. it's neck and neck for sure. 

i cannot rave enough about this place and i highly suggest that anyone going to vegas goes to lotus of siam. it's a quick cab ride from the strip and you won't be disappointed. just make sure you are a bit adventurous and don't order the pineapple fried rice or pad thai. you'll be missing out on the good stuff!"}
{"text":"We came here off recommendations from friends, raving about it being the best in town. There is no way. First off, it's in the hood and they want to be all bougie being in the hood? Doesn't make sense to me. The pricing was pretty high for Thai food and the portions were small. It's almost like they want to go the way of fancy food Thai style...where you go to a celebrity restaurant, get small portions of food at a high price. But those places are located on the Strip and are typically celebrity restaurants. I mean, the portions weren't as small as those places, but definitely a lot smaller than your usual Thai restaurants. For example, we ordered scallop appetizers that were approx $22 and you got 6 scallops (here we go again lol). We also order chicken wings appetizers and we got 7 (I think) and it was about $17. So no for me. Because if I want bougie Thai food, Lemongrass is the spot! Not across from the silver seven or whatever that place is. And I won't even get into the wait - omg!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for fight weekend and this place made it all complete. Wasn't sure if I was at the right spot at first and once I saw people come out we decided to go ahead. How glad we did this place was amazing. Each bite was exploding with flavor and your taste buds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I love Lotus of Siam!  We usually order off of the special list at the back of the menu, but there's only so much stomach room and we usually order the same thing over and over.

1.  Any red curry dish on the specials page (short rib, duck, etc.)
2.  Tom Yum Goong soup
3.  Mango Sticky Rice (dessert)
4.  Pad Thai (random, but its a little different here)

MUST MAKE RESERVATIONS ahead of time.  The only way around this (if you don't want to wait forever) is to go right before they open, so you'll get seated right away. 

Oh yeah, and they aren't shy about the spicy level, so if you ask for a 10, you better be prepared!  We like spicy and usually just go a little higher than what the dish is normally. 

Good luck and happy ordering!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and hot even  on the buffet.  Go early on weekend as tend to get crowded"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They clearly have a very unorganized reservations policy. I have lived in Vegas my entire life, and sometimes newer, and bigger is not better. The young lady over the phone was very rude, and did not seem to care about any questions I had about their new restaurant, or if I wanted to make a reservation. She insisted I go their, and stand in line with my 83 year old mother and hope to get a seat? Shameful. I will never eat at this establishment ever again... and from what I've read on other reviews it doesnt seem to be doing as well as the previous location. I have done nothing but speak highly of this restaurant, and will stop doing so as of today. Go to Komol, Arawan, or Le Thai downtown. Don't waist your time here at Lotus of Siam. Portion sizes have gotten smaller and prices have gotten higher.. All because of fancy decor? Fuh-getta-bout-it! No Khab Khun Kha!"}
{"text":"This place was way over hyped. Pad se-ew was mainly flavorless noodle. It contained very little chicken or broccoli. I also order Tom Yum noodle soup. The Tom yum had a variety of veggies that I haven't seen in the fish prior. The change of piece was different but I did enjoy it. Bit dishes were under salted. I have said it in every other review of a Thai restaurant but this place still can't compare to to Lucki Thai on the south side."}
{"text":"I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. The wait was about an hour but it wasn't too bad considering by the time we were leaving, there were still people waiting. Definitely make a reservation if you can! 

The restaurant is located in a somewhat empty plaza but when you enter the restaurant itself, it's a bit nicer. Service was good. They refilled my water without me having to ask and came to check up on us from time to time. 

We ordered: 

Crispy duck with Panang curry ($28) - basically fried duck in a red coconut curry sauce. This dish was a favorite of my boyfriend. The flavor was good and the crispness of the duck was a nice element with the curry. The duck itself was nothing special to me however. It was salty and without a lot of rice and curry, I wouldn't have eaten another bite. Probably would order the roasted duck with Panang curry next time, cheaper price for almost the same thing. 

Kha Soi ($10.95)- egg noodles in a coconut curry broth. I ended up ordering the beef to pair with the noodles. The noodle portion however, made me laugh. In one chopstick grab, I could hold all the noodles. Hilarious. The broth was even saltier than the duck. 

Garlic prawn ($28)- fried shrimp tossed in garlic and salt. Tastes exactly like it sounds. Nothing special. They separated the shell and the meat so one prawn looks especially big. Just ok. 


Overall, if I had just ordered regular Thai dishes, it would be okay, but for the price I paid for the garlic prawns and duck, it's way to overpriced. I can get a steak for that much. It's a nice run for your money. Not complaining though, it is Vegas after all."}
{"text":"Hmmm... 
I had a lot of high expectations for this place. It's so well-known and was voted one of the best Thai Restaurants in America. Yes, in America! Now, I do not know if it is because I live near Thai Town near Hollywood and have tried some bomb Thai food in the past, or even because west LA itself has good Thai food, but this place didn't blow my mind. It didn't necessarily disappoint either, as the food was all really good. I just think that I expected something different? 

We tried all the standard thai dishes here but I think my favorite was the garlic shrimp dish.  Dinner reservations are highly recommended. My friends and I made reservations here weeks in advance before our usual Vegas trip :) 
The place is popping and it is located in a random strip mall. The restaurant itself is actually very big.  Staff is friendly and the menu is very extensive. You also have the ability to customize when you order, the level of spicy for most if not all dishes they serve."}
{"text":"Came during lunch hours. The outside didn't look very promising, but I've learned not to judge a book by it's cover and I'm glad that I didn't!

So this was our first time and my friend ordered the Thai Fried Rice w/ Pork $8.95 and I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai $8.95. And not to forget the essential delicous thai teas.Portions were a good amount. My friend thought his fried rice didn't have enough flavor, but I really enjoyed my pad thai and even had enough to share. Service was okay. They seemed busy with other things, though the restaurant was about half full.

Overall, ambiance was good. Food was good. Service was okay. I definitely would like to come back to try some of their curries and the mee krob."}
{"text":"THE BEST.  Great service and the food is just..... DEELISHOUS..."}
{"text":"After the super write ups tried three different times to see why so great.  Disappointing ! Avewrage Thai food in below average place."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I got a chance to eat here. The restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall off of the strip and isn't much to look at. When you get inside at first it looks like your typical Thai place. Then you take a moment and realize the walls are covered with celebrity chef pictures who have been to this place. You then notice the very impressive wine collection. The place is also consistantly packed. Now to the food it was literally a party in our mouths. The food was so incredibly flavorful and bright. It was hands down the best Thai food I have ever had and will make a point to come back every time I'm in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to anyone. The service was also very quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Consistently enjoyable food, the only think that is keeping me from a 5 star review is the atmosphere and area."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand several times and have eaten Thai food in 5 star restaurants as well as street cart in Bangkok so when I was told this was the best Thai in the US I was really looking forward to trying it.

I asked the server what the best dish was, I don't remember the name but it was a spicy noodle dish with beef,  and I asked for it to be very spicy.  I ordered a half bottle of an Alsace Riesling and my meal came promptly.

The food was very good and the service was outstanding.   

After wards I checked out the Green Door across the parking lot...not quite Patpong, a little less  sleazy....yep Patpong is worse :)"}
{"text":"That crispy duck with panang sauce is everything. My fav was the mango and sticky rice dessert. The fried bananas were good, but nothing special about it. And I thought it was strange that we had to order the coconut ice cream in addition to the bananas. In my mind, the ice cream should be part of the dessert. Overall, delish!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas for business, I eat here at least twice. Truly the best Thai food I have ever had.  The crispy rice salad and Tom aka is delish. Never had a disappointing meal here!"}
{"text":"My very first experience with Thai cuisine. I was not disappointed. I had the Thai ice tea, a unique flavor, when it showed up I didn't know how to drink it, so the waiter was very patient and explained everything to me. Also have me recommendations on spice level and what I would probably like, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had heard mixed reviews about this place. Some said it lived up to the hype and others said it was overrated. I think it depends what you order. 

We ordered:
-Sizzling rice with tofu: one of their famous dishes. My friend who told us it was mostly overrated said this dish was worth it. It totally lived up to the hype
-Shrimp pad see ew: another friend recommended this dish and we enjoyed it.
-Softshell crab noodles: this was our wild card but I really enjoyed it! It's a bit sweeter than the pad see ew and this turned out to be a nice combination of dishes.

Solid 4- I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Garlic prawns! A must try 

All the other typical Thai dishes were mediocre. Was pretty expensive for the amount of food they give you. Service was fast, but seems like they were trying to rush you out so they can seat the next party. The restaurant was full within 10 minutes of opening at 530. There was already a couple people there around 515. I would actually give this place less than a 4 stars, but the garlic prawns were amazing! We also got the fried duck with drunken noodles and that was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Several ppl told us to check out this Thai restaurant while in Vegas.  It's a little off the beaten path, a $8 Uber from Aria area.  The place is located in a shabby strip mall where there is really nothing else to see or do.  For a Monday lunch it was surprisingly busy.  The walls were covered with awards and pics of celebrities.

I did a little research and made sure to order what they are known for- the Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck Curry.  Both dishes were delicious.
The Garlic Prawns are deep fried with their shells and sautéed with a flavorful garlic seasoning/sauce.  The shells are meant to be eaten but after a while you will realize you're eating shells.  The duck curry was also very tasty and had a nice crisp.  One caveat - the portion was a bit small.  

Service was quick and friendly.  I heard it gets really busy during dinner so lunch is the better way to go.  

Overall, great meal but would be better if they were located closer to the strip and we didn't have to pay to get there."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Thai places that I have ever had. EVER! 

Drove into Vegas on Friday night and arrived around 6 after the wife and mother made a stop and did some damage at the Primm outlets... Only wished they waited to see if there was extra money AFTER the trip from Vegas (sigh)... Called to see if we could sneak in for a reservation and we ended up with one for Saturday night instead. We were set on coming to eat here at least once on every trip. 

Stick to the specialty dishes... you won't be disappointed - You can get your Pad Thai and Thai BBQ chicken elsewhere at the cheap corner Thai place back home 

We had 5 of us dining together family style and indulged on a few of the house specialties and we were not disappointed. 

The Lineup: 

Kai Soi Braised Short Ribs 
- The meat was flavorful and served with a fried egg noodle in a generous serving of sauce. 4.5 star dish 

The Prawns on the Drunken Noodles 
- This one was good, but the drunken noodles could have used more flavoring. The shrimp was well seasoned even without mixing it in with the Thai herb/veggie slaw. 4 star dish 

Crispy Duck Panang 
- This was the favorite of the table. The Panang sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was even better. I could have licked every last drop off of the plate. 5 star dish 

Sea Bass on Papaya Salad 
- This was a great dish to balance out the vibrant and spicy traditional Thai flavors along with the richness from the curry dish with its delicate papaya salad that had thinly sliced apples and papaya mixed in with grapes and topped with a wonderful portion of Sea Bass. 4.5 Stars

Clean up (aka Dessert) 

The combo platter 
(They were out of mangos since they said it was out of season) 
Sticky rice topped with Coconut Ice Cream 
-This was my favorite on the platter! 
Fried Bananas 
-Another Good one 
Thai Custard 
-This was a miss for me. It was a little on the thick side and not as delicate as a Chinese custard or traditional creme brulee."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the famous \"lotus of siam\" everyone talks about so I wanted to see it for myself..
Ordered stuffed chicken wing . Chicken satay . Spicy fried rice with basil . Pad thai . And panang curry beef..
All the dishes were okay.. not awesome.. The problem was at the curry.. As shown in the picture there were almost no curry in there.. 5 spoons at most and I told the server I don't see any curry in there and he said that's how it is... I ordered curry not beef with curry sauce... mediocre taste and expensive portions small... guess that's what happens when you make too much money and busy.. lose quality.."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Thai food in my 20 something years and I must say this place set the bar. Everything else from here on out is going to be mediocre. Granted it was on the freaking pricey side but at least it was tasty. 

Sea bass w drunken noodles: bomb sea bass. It was perfectly fried. It wasn't too breaded. The fish really held on its own. The noodles were spicy but not too spicy. 

Garlic prawns: they hooked it up. I mean I guess they should for the price. It was so crispy and tasty. I ate the heads whole. If you're not eating the head then you're missing out. Waste not, want not. 

Tom yum soup: they use fresh mushrooms. Other places will use canned mushrooms. It was good. My boyfriend was hungover and it got his stamp of approval. 

Nam Prik Ong: it was okay. I thought it was going to be better because it was on the food network. It reminded me of tomato sauce with pork. I was hoping it would be spicy, it wasn't. The chicharron was the best part."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! I am in Las Vegas often, and I have been wanting to eat here for a while. Well worth the wait, I cannot wait to come back and try something different."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit here after watching it on Food Network. We went on a weekday at 12PM and there was no line! We walked in and was seated right away. 

We ordered the Crispy Duck Curry (Spicy), Garlic Prawns, Fried Rice, Drunken Noodle with Beef, and Pad thai chicken. Everything was so flavorful, spicy, crispy and crunchy. It was a delicious meal. The garlic prawns were so crispy, and the shell was stuck on the side to the meat. The meat was so juicy and flavorful, and the shell was so crispy and delicious! The servers were all very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place seeing that it was a rundown strip mall. The location is a little bit on the shady side. Not exactly a place I would walk around alone at night time; however, we went for lunch so I was safe side. My friends had been talking about it for months on how amazing this place is but as a California resident I never come out as often as I'd like. I finally got to try it the other day, and all I can say is that this place is just RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!!! 

We had drunk noodles with Chilean Sea Bass, soft crab, crispy duck with panning curry, crab fried rice, garlic prawns, and the garlic beef to share between 6 guys. Normally, I would say Thai dishes specializes in a few things and I would be able to rate between least favorite to most, but I have to say everything was simply delicious. Between 6 guys it wasn't a lot, but just right. It was really something where you could appreciate each dish by itself. Eating it together was just heaven. 

I would say it's a little on the pricey side. We shared between 6 guys with each person getting a Thai iced tea or coffee and it came out to $200 or $33 per person. I suppose it could be cheaper if you go a la carte, but if you want to do Thai family style then you order dishes on dishes, but as a once in a while thing when I go to Vegas: WORTH IT! 

I can't wait to come out again and bring some of my friends to go visit the place. Real subtle twists on already tasty Thai food favorites. It was a real great end to an already successful trip!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint.

My fave is the garlic prawns, crispy and flavored right.

Liked the preparation of kra pow moo krab but maybe need to review portion size or increase price.

Other items are ok like sea bass pad see eww and panang curry .

Coming back if in vicinity."}
{"text":"At Lotus I close my eyes and point and that is what I have for dinner.  It has never let me down, and honestly I am not that adventurous an eater. We take everyone here that we can and this is the not so secret gem of the Vegas foodies."}
{"text":"Was so glad we finally made it to this place. When you see the outside, you might think twice, but it had been recommended by several people. The food was excellent, service was excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone. We ordered the fried wontons, soft shell crab drunkin noodles, pad thai and the banana spring rolls which were all delish!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend making reservations. 
Food is delicious & Service is great."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food.  Hands down the best I've ever had.  For Apps, the Tom Kha soup (my fav Asian soup) is a great balance of all the right flavors.  The spicy chicken wings are sweet, spicy and herby all at the same time.
For entrees, I love the Sea Bass on drunken noodles.  Any version of the crispy duck is killer, esp the chili mint variety.  Red curry is usually my benchmark for a Thai spot and theirs is on point.  With spice levels from 1-10, they can please any palette, spicy or mild.  Just be ready to sweat if u go near 10.
For dessert, don't skip the fried bananas with coconut ice cream and sticky rice. It's the perfect end to a spicy meal. 
All in all, Lotus of Siam is by far the best Thai I've ever had and I would strongly recommend leaving the strip for this James Beard nominated gem."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We did the garlic prawns and the crispy duck curry dish and it was all so yummy! Went at lunch and it was crowded but no wait!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Lotus of Siam... great food and friendly service. It's always a wait time but the food is that great it's well worth it. Haven't had anything I didn't like"}
{"text":"There are a lot of great recommendations here. I highly recommend trying the sea bass section. Its a bit pricey but there is no price limit for good food. I had the sea bass with papaya, it came with sliced grapes, tomatoes, and roasted peanuts. All i can say is wow - that is some great stuff.  It's  got a nice amount of fish sauce that isn't smelly old like many Thai restaurants and the combination of the salty fish with tomatoes and grapes makes a flavorful-lively color on my palette. Suggest for first timers or anyone already familiar with Thai to skip the basics like curry because if you traveling from out of town I would push that you try something else. There are many wonderful dishes you can see at the entrance the wall of pictures that we're mentioned in the local news to get an idea

Its now become my favorite stop every time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is great.  I read lots of good reviews before coming here, and my friend said his parents know the owner.

So when I arrived, I asked to talk to the owner, to do some name dropping, and hoping for a discount.  The owner had a blank face when I mentioned the names.   Too bad, no discount for me.

Wife and I ordered from the menu while the kid had the buffet.  I took a bite or two from his plate, and I gotta say, the buffet isn't as good.  So when you go there, make sure you order off the menu!

we had the pineapple fried rice and the tom yum soup.  both taste authentic and yummy.  their thai ice tea was good too!

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love the yellow curry, not a place to relax with friends, almost feels like a PHO place I visited in Phoenix where they get you in and out like cattle.  Food is amazing, but not my type of restaurant"}
{"text":"I've now had 2 dinners here and I much prefer eating here than having dinner on the strip.

The food is delicious and there is also a great wine selection! I've never been to a thai restaurant that takes wine pairing so seriously, it's awesome.

My most favorite dish is the braised short rib Khao Soi. Braised short ribs on top of egg noodles with the most delicious coconut curry ever. You definitely need some sticky rice to dip in the sauce as well. So good!

I also really liked the garlic prawns. Very fried so I recommend sharing this dish with a big group. 1 is enough.

Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice salad) is a great starter. Everyone seems to order this and it's definitely for a reason.

No reservations are taken over the summer so get here early! We arrived with a group of 8 at about 5:10 on Saturday and were 2nd in line. By the time they opened at 5:30 there was a giant line. By 7:30 when we left there were TONS of people waiting.."}
{"text":"This place is located off the strip and in a plaza with lots of other asian foods.  Once you walk in, it is very large and accomodates a lot people.  They have pictures of all the famous people who have come to visit, all over their walls.  There's a huge glass room filled with various wines and I was pleasantly surprised by the great selection of wine they offered.  

We were seated and given the menus.  Now, the menu is HUGE!! There were so many items on it that it took awhile for us to even choose things off of it.  Here's what we ordered:  (They ask for the level of spicy 1-10, so that's why the numbers are next to it) 

Papaya salad 8 - It was very good but 8 is a bit spicy for me and I'm Korean... I eat everything spicy!! I would opt for 6 or 7 next time.
Garlic prawns- They were charred a bit, butterflied open and delicious!! Definitely would order this again!!
Pad thai-  It was too sweet, didn't like it.
Pork satay- The meat was so soft and juicy and dipping sauce was very good.
Nua yum katium 6-  This is most likely what I know as \"crying tiger\".  It was okay but I don't think we will order this again etiher.  

I will say that the food was wonderful... once you get it.  It took at least 30 minutes for our appetizers and we waited over 40 minutes for our food.  I really wanted to have the mango sticky rice for dessert but they were out.

Overall, the experience was great.  I would return because of the quality of food.  Area of opportunity for them, service."}
{"text":"I can't remember the names of the dishes but I will try to describe them.  We ordered almost exclusively from the Northern menu and were not disappointed.

Crispy rice appetizer thingy: tangy and a little spicy.  Good texture with a sour kick.

Green chili dip with fresh vegetables and sticky rice: my favorite dish.  The \"dip\" was smashed up vegetables and peppers and had such a rich flavor.  Came garnished with pork cracklings.

Spicy chicken soup hot pot: spicy, sour broth and the slippery goodness of oyster mushrooms!  Thought I could handle it until I swallowed a lump of not-yet-dissolved chili paste.

Jackfruit something: served in a clay pot.  The menu says that jackfruit tastes like artichoke hearts.  Yes, but sweeter and more mango-ey.

This was a fun dinner.  Good quality, but a bit pricier than I expected."}
{"text":"Just fyi: they're not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday.

The first time I came to this place was when I drove in on a Friday night around 8pm. We strolled in and they said the wait was going to be about an hour and some change so we bailed out. This time around, I played it safe and made reservations again for a Friday night at 6:30 pm. We were seated within a few minutes upon arrival. At that very moment the restaurant was half full so technically I didn't really need the reservations. As time progressed, the restaurant got crowded quite swiftly.

There are numerous friendly servers here which is great, plenty of help. You'll always have people walking around, which you can flag down at any time. It did however took some time to get the food out. We would get half our order then there would be a period of silence. Other servers would approach us and think we were waiting for the check when we were actually waiting for the rest of our food.

As for the food here, the menu is practically endless. You'll find all your typical dishes you would find in any Thai restaurant, there's some pricey specialties aka chef's recommendations at the back of the menu. However, I think there best deal are their authentic and different Thai regional dishes. Growing up eating Thai food practically everyday, I stayed clear from all your everyday Pad Thais and of the sort.

We started off with the Tom Yum Pla Dook aka Tom Yum catfish soup. I had all my dishes made with three stars (1-10 spiciness star rating) just to keep it safe. Three stars wasn't spicy, a tingling feel but it won't make your toes curl yet. You can always add more chili if you ask for the condiments. Great soup starter and perfect hangover remedy. Tanginess and some spiciness is ideal after a night of boozing.

Nam Khoa Tod - appetizer style dish where they fry the rice along with some other herbal type ingredients. Another authentic Thai dish that many restaurant choose not not to carry (don't ask why I don't know). Overall not too shabby, I'd order it again.

Moo Yaang aka marinated grilled pork. It's really hard to mess this one up. The sauce that accompanies this dish could've used some help though. I'm use to a stronger sauce taste and it was a little bland for my taste buds. BTW, sticky rice (extra $2) is great with this dish but I think they give you a bowl of steam rice instead.

Neua Naam Thok, direct translation: beef waterfall. You know how sometimes beef has a distinct taste to it? Well this one had it. I couldn't stomach more than half. Probably the weakest link that I ordered.

The portions here aren't too big. Four orders for two people may sound like a lot but we were able to eat at least 80% into it. For Las Vegas, this place isn't bad at all and I would like to come back to try some more of their authentic selection. I'm not going to lie, it's not the BEST THAI FOOD ever but it's up to par for Vegas standards and who they're truly trying to cater to. Remember to make that reservation beforehand and play it safe.

Dinner for 2: $50ish."}
{"text":"Oh Lotus of Siam. How I have been dreaming about you..!

I have been coming to this restaurant for years now. Almost 4x a year on my quarterly Vegas trips...but it had been awhile since I've been back. 

So on my last trip, I decided to reward my belly with the best Thai food ever. Call me crazy, but I totally don't remember Lotus of Siam tasting as good as it did the last time I went. 

I had a party of 4 and no reservations early Sunday night. Luckily there was room for us (typically if you have no reso, you can expect to eat dinner at 9pm..or never!). It's always a good sign to see other customers coming to eat at the restaurant via taxi with all of their luggage in tow. You know they mean business. 

We didn't order too much since we weren't that hungry. We had 2 soups (just cups) of the Tom Yum Kai and wonton soup. They were both great! We then ordered the green papaya salad, and weren't disappointed. It was so perfectly seasoned and refreshing. 

For our entrees we ordered the green curry (it had eggplant..yumm), pad thai and the best chinese broccoli w/ fried pork belly I've ever had in the world. 

Why oh why is fried pork belly bad for you? Well, just for an hour forget about how unhealthy it is and just eat as much as you can!! The 4 of us were fighting over the last piece of crispy goodness. 

They expanded their dining area and even have a bar!! There are also 2 bathrooms for your enjoyment.

There are only 2 things I can complain about Lotus:
1. The portions are smaller than your usual Thai joint. So if we were really hungry, we would have had to have ordered 2 more entrees and 1 more salad for sure for our party of 4. 
2. Service was incredibly slow during our dinner. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if they're still adjusting to the new additional dining area, but we waited a long long time for our food. We had to ask our waiter 2x to check on it. 

But despite these 'complaints', they really won't stop me from coming back. If anything, I've been caught drooling at my desk, thinking about Lotus of Siam. It's definitely the best Thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best food all week for us. We wanted to hit it a second night but couldnt get reservations in time. Amazing experience. Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food, what really puts it over the top is that they actually have a serious wine list filled with German rieslings that pair splendidly with this type of food - a feature that pretty much all other hole in the wall Asian restaurants like this typically fall short on. The downside is you end up spending more on wine than food ($120 for 2 people, including tip, at a restaurant where the average entree is $10. Huh???!).  I had drunken noodles with sea bass, which is apparently 3x as much as the drunken noodles on the menu.  Still though, the fish was fresh and delicious and the dish was great.   The beef jerky appetizer was nicely flavored but almost too tough to get my teeth through, however.  Finished the meal with an egg roll banana with  coconut of sorts, which was a nice light way to conclude.

Will go back here again, for sure!  The parking lot is sketchy, the strip mall is a dump, and the place itself wins no marks for decor.  But the food is great and attention to detail with serious wine is much appreciated (including by Robert Parker, who reviewed the place).  Although I'll probably order one of the cheaper $9 dishes.  Oh, and I dropped in on a Saturday night around 8 pm and had no problem getting a table.

***Updating my review after making 3 trips in total out here.***

So some of the dishes are quite average, the panang curry was pretty blah and bland, and the service can be so horrendous that you wonder if anyone is running the show.  The cashew chicken dish is just ok but again, about what I'd expect at an average Thai restaurant.  These people are seriously confused.  Lunchtime is a completely different scene (a 2-star one) compared to dinner (4 stars).  So I have to downgrade this place, seeing as I am very stingy with 5 stars and I wish more people would be."}

{"text":"A friend of ours recommended Lotus to us and it is in a really bad neighborhood. We are now regulars and come here about 2-3 times a week. We always get the same thing: crispy duck with basil sauce, garlic prawns, beef salad, deep fried catfish, minced pork with basil sauce again, and if they have it on special, the lobster is to die for! (although the lobster is VERY pricey and large portion).

There is always a wait and they don't do same day reservations, and we don't even bother coming on a Friday or Saturday, its just too packed. We also try to come late around 9 pm for dinner to avoid the lines. 

My bf didn't even like Thai food before but now is a believer, IT'S THAI FOOD AT IT'S FINEST!"}
{"text":"What's up with Vegas and the hidden gems in sh!t hole strip malls?  Yelp is revealing these bad boys all over the place.  We drove up on this spot and \"uhh, where are we?\", mouth half cocked, looking around for a good reason to park.

We walk up to an opaque store front surrounded by what looks like a quasi-deserted strip mall.  The only thing luring us in was 4.5 stars on 1200+ reviews.  

Door opens and we walk into a vampire underworld.  What we thought was going to be a tiny place was huge, and filled with people of all ages and ethnicities grubbing down in large groups and couples.  It was crazy.  All the locals must have agreed to place this off the beaten trail, wrap it camouflage, and make it look inhabitable so tourists would stay away.

The War Wonton Soup is the best I've ever had. My mouth just filled up with juice as I wrote that.  You don't even need soy sauce.  The garlic flavor is so damn good.

I can't recall all of the names of our plates, but we had duck, pork, pot stickers, and yellow curry chicken, all of which were killer.

They say american spice is a 5 so we tried that and it was just right.  10 is the highest, but being new to this restaurant, we didn't want to chance anything higher.  Thai places are all over the board with their spice scale, besides, they'll give you extra spice to kick it up an notch or five.

Definitely going back.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Busy AF!/hole in the wall, restaurant! I dont eat Thai much but everything here was great. Solid 4.5 stars!

I must first add how impressively clean their comfort room is here. You know what they say, 'If the bathrooms legit, imagine how maintained the kitchen is\".
Here it is in a nutshell. (Crack!) Crispy Duck Curry(10). Pad Thai(10). Drunken Noodles(7). Pinot Grigio wine(7). Pepper garlic beef(6). Garlic Prawn(10). Combonation Fried Rice(9). Steam Mussels w/sauce(10).

Food is definitely dee'lishh here! Just be aware each dish is only meant to serve two so i will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu with a few less people."}
{"text":"Take me to Thailand already!

Was soooo excited to come here after hearing about this place for years! Thai restaurants are pretty standard in the Bay Area, so I was really hoping for something different. 

Reservations are a must for dinner (or anytime, probably)!! Or come right when they open at 5:30PM and get your name on the list. I came here on a Sunday night at 6PM and it was already a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table for two.

Definitely try to order items you don't normally see at other Thai restaurants. That's the key. If you go for the same old stuff that everywhere else has, then that's what you're gona get... the same 'ol boring stuff. Try something different!

Get the Nam Kao Tod! It's crispy puffy rice sauteed with sour sausage. It sounds a little weird, but it's delicious! I love the crispy texture and there's tons of tangy flavor from the sausage and citrus they put in it. Watch out for the heat though! It might not seem that spicy at first, but the spice creeps up on you and lingers!

The drunken noodles with soft shell crab was SO GOOD. The sauce for the noodles is on the sweeter side. It's a nice compliment to the salty, crunchy soft shell crab. Don't forget to eat some of the deep fried basil leaves with it!

But the most amaaazing thing was their mango and sticky rice! HANDS DOWN the BEST mango and sticky rice I've ever had! The mango was perfectly ripe and so sweet. The sticky rice was unique with the hint of floral in the background. And I couldn't get enough of their coconut milk!

This is also a great place for you wine lovers! Their wine ROOM is astonishing. They have a whole binder as their wine list. They even have one FULL page dedicated to German Rieslings alone!

The menu here is huge. There's no way you can hit everything in one visit. I need to come here every time I'm in Vegas until I try it all!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai I had in a very long time.   I had the Crispy Duck with Drunken Noodles... Absolutely amazing!  The dish was made with fresh basil, green peppers, garlic and onions.  I ordered with a medium heat of \"5\".  Service was wonderful.  We walked to the location from the SLS Las Vegas, I would recommend driving.  The place doesn't look like much from the out side but its a nice casual atomsphere inside."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant. I eat Thai in every city that I travel to. I would recommend if you go with a group, order multiple entrees and serve family style. Two must entrees. Duck panang curry and Seabass drunken noodles. However, I've tried most everything and there is nothing I didn't like."}
{"text":"Not worth the fuss! Food was good but VERY VERY small portions. I ordered take out and spent $80.00 for 5 portions. I was expecting $80.00 worth of food. When I opened my take out I was so shocked.. I called the restaurant, I explained to the manager how my food was so rationed that Im sure there was a mistake. I sent the photos of the entrees. They commented back and the manager said, \"yes thats how we serve very small portions.\" It was less than half for each take out box. I felt so ripped off. It is worth the posting to inform you of a cheap place that can't give you full portions. You're not that good..

Le Thai is the new place to eat. East Fremont Great food and excellent portions. 702-778-0888

{"text":"Delicious, Get the beef kao soi #1 heat level with extra coconut cream! It is to die for!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum
Worth the trip off the strip. 
Very crowded, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"A group of us shared some dishes and we all enjoyed everything.  The crispy duck dish seemed to be favored.  The short ribs were great.   The yellow and red curries were delicious.  Except I got a very spicy pepper when eating the red.  So be careful.   It was packed on Friday night, so try to call for a reservation."}
{"text":"I love to follow Anthony Bourdain's restaurant recommendations so here I am, at what is claimed \"best Thai restaurant in America\" and the experience has lived up to this claim. 

I followed the advice to order Northern Thai special dishes which you don't find in many Thai restaurants. 
1) red chili dip: delicious. The meat sauce was yummy. It wasn't spicy and great dip with the fresh veggies 
2) koong char num plar (raw prawns): loved this dish we ordered 2. You add some of the specify sweet sauce, some spicy sauce, mint leaves and garlic. Explosion of flavors in your mouth. In most Thai restaurant I would be scared to eat raw prawns but not here!
3) thum-ka noon (pounded young jack fruit shredded). This is interesting dish. Didn't look nor taste like what I had expected. I don't think I've ever had jack fruit. It was great with rice
4) khao Soi (northern Thai noodle dish). This was my favorite dish
5) Northern Thai sausages. Loved the variety of taste

Service was excellent, we came at 11am (right when the door opened). 

Will definitely come again and I will order sticky rice with the dishes instead of regular Thai rice! Also, I can eat very spicy but wasn't sure how spicy they do so we asked for \"medium\" which turned out not spicy enough. So if you like spicy I suggest levels above \"medium\"!!!"}
{"text":"Great garlic prawns and fried duck in curry sauce. A bit pricey with a automatic 18 percent service charge."}
{"text":"Everything I have had is top notch. They are famous for the northern Thai menu. I'm on a business trip and I have eaten here three out of four days. I have gotten crispy duck panang, crispy garlic shrimp and khao sai with beef. All were delicious.  I wish I could find such an authentic Thai place in Miami.  I was not able to get a reservation for any night this week but if you come early you can eat at the bar or at this strip of chairs along the wall."}
{"text":"This place lives up to it's hype. It's REALLY good Thai food that doesn't just include Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. I ended up ordering random things on the menu and they were all awesome. The flavors are so good here -- the meat is especially flavorful. 

The location looks like a sketchy strip mall, but you should stop here anyways. It is totally worth it. I would suggest making a reservation though because it gets REALLY busy."}
{"text":"An amazing selection of great food.   Come hungry with a decent size group (4 minimum) so you can partake of a large variety of shared dishes."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and make a reservation prior to arrival otherwise you may be waiting for quite some time for a table. This place is hidden in the same shopping center of the notorious Green Door. Don't let that stop you from going here though!

The very BEST Thai spot I have ever eaten on the west coast. If you're not a fan of spices order 0. What most Thai spots elsewhere consider a 5 this place covers in a 2-3 rating for spice. The soft shell drunken noodles are to die for. Service once you're seated is very quick. 

I'm not a wine drink or alcohol drinker BUT rumor has it they have an amazing bottle of wine and their selection is quite exclusive."}
{"text":"Wow, I was really disappointed. In my opinion this place is very overrated. I've had much better in Seattle, California and Ithaca (believe it or not). 

I asked for recommendations, and the waiter recommended drunken noodles, and duck panang curry. I was a little disappointed because the dishes sounded ordinary, and I felt like he may have assumed we were not adventurous by our appearances. I may go back and order dishes off the northern menu, or make it clear I'm adventurous. 

Anyway, off of recommendations online and from the waiter we got the garlic prawns, crispy rice, and duck with masaman curry. 

The crispy rice really didn't appeal to me. It tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and even had large strips of ginger in it. A little ginger goes a long way! It also had too much lemon grass. Eating it made my mouth fatigued and overwhelmed and not in a pleasant way at all. The sausage was really not good. The flavors just weren't balanced and the texture of the rice was good but not great. The pig skins in there were very good - I wish there had been more. 

The garlic prawns were really not good either. the shrimp meat was overcooked, but my main complaint was the flavor. The fried shrimp shells were very interesting and the texture was pleasing, but there was just no flavor in the dish at all besides black pepper and an oily fried food taste. Some kind of dipping sauce would have been ideal, but proper seasoning might have been enough to make it good. I kept dipping it in the red curry that came with but I would've preferred something acidic or sweet. Really ANYTHING to balance out the oily taste. It was served over slaw, but that was not dressed either - it was just there to catch the excess oil. 

The duck dish was very good. The duck was excellent, but I don't think it paired that well with masaman curry. I would order this again with a different sauce. It was silly of me to order the curry because, c'mon, you can get that kind of curry anwhere! But the curry tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, and I would've preferred if it wasn't broken. Overall, very disappointing. It wasn't worth the stomach ache of three deep fried dished, that's for sure! 

Also, yes it's easy to get a taxi there but how do you get back?? I had to wait an hour for a taxi to come get us after the meal and they had no idea where it was and couldn't find the restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG.. Best reason to come to Vegas now. I am hooked. So many items, such fresh food and great service.

Cheers and well done!"}
{"text":"While ridiculous adding a review to a business that already has 1k+ here in Yelp I felt compelled to add my voice echoing the experience so many others have had. 

The food - excellent. 
The staff - cheerful and attentive.

The only drawback which likely doesn't matter to most is the \"hole-in-the-wall\" aspect. If ambiance is not something you are looking for then consider this a five star review."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas for authentic, spicy, flavorful Thai food.

I've been coming here for about 10 years now.  I love their Thai curries.  I used to love their lunch buffets but they stopped that about a year ago.  I don't know why because it was popular.

They lose one star because staff are consistently unfriendly & indifferent.  And, although the decor was updated a few years ago it still lacks ambience and privacy.

Timing is everything.  If you want to be seated on a Friday or Saturday night make sure you have a booking first otherwise you'll be waiting outside for over an hour and their tiny waiting area only has a couple of seats."}
{"text":"This was my third visit here (first was tourist then second and thrid as a local) and I was not impressed with the food at all.  This place is overrated!  It is understandable for tourists whom donot know any better and always wanted to try places with longer line or impossible to get reservation.  But for local folks, there are better Thai food in Vegas.  My YUM WOON SEN SEAFOOD salad was salty and sour.   The same salty and sour taste was presented in PLAR DOOK O-CHA (Whole Fried Catfish).  The golden fried tofu was soggy, cold, and over price ($7.95).  My friend ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup and he said it tasted nothing but spicy hot.  My other friend got the Pad Se-ew and she was disappointed.  She is a local and said it tasted better several years ago.  She told us to try different places next time we come to Vegas and don't come back again.  My friends got wine and they said it was OK.  We skipped desert (fried banana) because there was no point after the soggy fried tofu."}
{"text":"Words cannot explain ... how great this place is. You just have to go! Everything good you heard about this place is true."}
{"text":"Dear Lotus of Siam,

I still love you, but I also hate you.  Your old location gave us more food and attentive service, but this new location just blows.  You don't pay too much attention to us anymore and you give us half the portion that it used to be.  I mean, I get it.  New location, upgrades, and probably newer furniture, but please remember, you are just a Thai restaurant.  That Thai restaurant you used to be on the other side of town in that strip mall.  I miss that RESTAURANT. Your new location is nice and bougie, but you aren't even that busy anymore... and YOU KNOW WHY.  Stop skimping us out on your food portions and maybe I'll return.  In the meantime, I'm going to stick to another favorite of mine.

{"text":"I could eat here everyday for every meal.  We ate dinner twice in 3 days when we were Vegas last September.  We had the roasted duck curry, green curry beef, Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow, Kang Care, Sai Oua , and the Nam Prik Ong.  Fabulous!!  It's no wonder this restaurant is a James Beard winner and voted the best Thai restaurant in the U.S.  The kicker...the prices are not exorbitant.  We spent about under $50 for two people which included three dishes, dessert, and drinks."}
{"text":"We went to this place after reading an article about Susan Millikin's recommendations for restaurants she likes to eat at around town. It's the best Thai in Las Vegas! We had the spicy beef salad, the shrimp pad Thai and the roasted duck curry. Fresh flavors well spiced and excellent presentation. We will definitely be back dragon and again!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

this place is aight went here the other day with my poker roommates. Not really a thai food kinda guy but this is one of the better ones that i have been to i must admit

Pros - food is actually pretty good. we basically went to town on the whole menu.  
    the fried wontons to start are really good.
    theyre green curry has a nice lil kik to it def recommended

Cons - Hard to find. Located in a pretty sketch area
   they dont give you much food... so you have to order like 10 diff things.
   pineapple fried rice wasnt very good.  how can you mess up rice??? but 
       apparently you can

recommended but not open till very late which sux because I think everything in Vegas should be open 24/7"}
{"text":"The portions here are small, but boy are they flavorful!!! Go for the Garlic Prawns! It's a must. I love how I was able to eat the shell."}
{"text":"Got seated really quick and ordered 6 items for 2.  The waiter was really good and the first 2 appetizers were out in 10 minutes but then the other 4 items came 35 minutes after the order.   Food wise I had better."}
{"text":"Hostesses majorly misquoted the wait time by 2 hours and were incredibly rude about it. I was pissed but had 8 hungry family members waiting including a 5 year old so we tried to find seating at the bar.

THANKFULLY an amazing server named Emily helped move some people around to accommodate us. She was so friendly, so patient, and constantly checked in on us and made sure our order was perfect. 

What was sure to be zero stars is now 4 stars because of her. Emily's service was 5 stars but 4 stars because the portion sizes were REALLY small (think ALMOST tapas) and food was okay but the crispy duck was definitely delicious.

Thank you Emily for letting our dinner end well! I was so ready to write a scathing review and our entire group agreed Emily was awesome!"}
{"text":"Twice a year we come to Vegas for work and I have been meaning to eat at Lotus of Siam for the last three years we've come. For some reason we were never able to go but this time around we definitely made it a priority -- from now on, I will be coming here EVERY trip.

This was hands-down the BEST thai I have eaten, anywhere. I am a huge fan of Thai food and while it is always really delicious, I have never eaten Thai at a restaurant where I was blown away by the flavor, ingredients and innovation in traditional dishes. I researched what I should order (there are magazine articles dedicated to what you should order when you visit!) and so our table of six ordered:  Som Thum, Crispy Rice with Sausage, Golden Tofu, Tom Kha Kai, Yellow Curry Beef, Garlic Prawn, Chicken Rama, Crispy Duck Panang Curry, and one of each of the desserts. We also doubled up (and tripled) on some of the dishes. Holy crap - everything I ate exploded in my mouth with flavor. The Crispy Rice, Golden Tofu, and Crispy Duck Panang Curry really stood out in my opinion. This falls into the top three best meals I have ever eaten in my life. No wonder this is a foodie destination.

Beware:  we ordered level 7 spice on the Tom Kha Kai (Bangkok Style Soup) and Som Thum (Green Papaya Salad) and were practically blowing out fire. :-) Still really delicious though, but know your level of spice!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The menu is huge so we asked the waiter (so helpful!) to recommend some of the restaurant's specialties.  What we were served was an array of food that you don't see at most Thai restaurants in the US.  Where's the Pad Thai?  Where's the chicken satay?  Yes, these are on the menu but they're not \"special.\"  In fact, some of the dishes we were served are ones that I would never order on my own but I am so glad that the waiter picked them.  Sometimes you have to just go with it!

Highlights:
Beef short rib in Penang red curry (best Thai red curry ever)
Beef jerky (who would have thought?)
Nam Kao Tod (crispy fried rice - unique!)
Coconut ice cream (incredibly creamy and non-dairy too!)
Fried bananas (simple and outrageously good)

Also, the selection of German (!) wines is huge and we had two different Rieslings from J.J. Prum of the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region.  Yummy.

BTW, the Pad Thai is pretty good too."}

Nothing else compares!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I have ever had, such a bummer when they close for private parties.... Didn't get my fix last time I was in Vegas

Kinda hard to find this place, its behind the strip mall of the address it uses.  They close at ten so go early!"}
{"text":"It's worth the 1300+ reviews, and the five stars.  This place is amazing.  I've been here a number of times; probably every other trip to Vegas for me.  

It's not actually that far off the strip, but it's in this really terribly run down strip mall that feels really sketch.  It's hard to see from the front, and you'll think \"am I really in the right place\"????  Well, you are.  And you really did want to go here.

The food is frankly fantastic.  Every single thing I've had there is some of the best Thai food I've had, and I've been there with several people who have spent time in Thailand, and they said it was some of they best they've had as well.  

Make sure to not skip out on the Northern Thai / Burmese food that's on the menu as well.  

Last time I was here, we were in a rush to get to the airport, told the waiter, and the food was on the table in 15 minutes flat; it was amazing how good the service and speed was.  

Oh, and did I mention it's cheap?"}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 2 stars for the incredibly long painful wait for a table.

This is one of the best Thai restaurants in the USA. Authentic and delicious. The place was buzzing and overly busy during Project trade show. 

Started with Sigha beer then Chang beer waiting for 1.5 hours for a table. Worth the wait yes.

The Northern Thai dishes are incredible. (This is their speciality).

Started with Tod Mun Plar - fried fish cakes and they are yummy. Also spicy chicken wings which are some of the spiciest I have had in a while and delicious too!

Then comes the Tom Yum Koong soup - hot and sour shrimp soup with lime and lemongrass also amazing.

For entree I had issan style grilled pork sausage with chili and peanuts, one of my go to dishes when it's on the menu in any Thai place. Nua yum Katiem was outstanding, this dish is sliced beef served with cabbage tangy sauce and smothered with fresh garlic, drool worthy!

This place is off the beaten path, not on the strip but 100% worth a cab ride to eat in this hidden gem."}
{"text":"My managers and chefs were throwing a congratulations dinner for me and two of my other co-workers for winning \"Employees of the Year\". To say the least, we were all excited.  

As soon as i walked in, i was greeted by an extremely unfriendly hostess. She showed me to my table(refer to pic) and of course i was the first to get there. On the way to the table i was taken directly past their amazing wine room and beautiful art which lined the walls. After my colleagues arrived, we ordered some apps to be shared family style.

1.KOONG SARONG ( Prawn in a blanket )
-Absolutely delicious! Marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and rice paper crepe, deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce.
2.STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS
-Good. Chicken wings stuffed with ground pork deep fried, served with sweet & sour sauce. Without the sauce, the chicken was dry. With the sauce, Great!
3.NAM KAO TOD
-Awesome! Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice. We got this dish at a 7 heat level and it went beautifully with our wine selection!

For my entree i ordered the GINGER FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger accompanied by a black mushroom sauce. This dish was really good. I stuck with a 4 heat level just to be cautious, and it definitely could have used more heat. The skin was perfectly cooked. With each bite of delicate flesh there was an even better crunch. The mushrooms added a nice earthiness to the dish which gave a great balance.

One of my colleagues ordered the SWEET & SOUR FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with Thai style sweet and sour sauce. which he had no complaints about. 

Everybody at the table seemed to enjoy everything... all except my general manager. For his entree he ordered DUCK with some sort or mint and ginger(from what i can remember). Not only did it come out after all of our entree's, but it was cold. Now we had a situation where no one wanted to eat until everybody had their food. The person that didn't have their food was, of course, one of the people paying. HORRIBLE FEELING! He finally got his food, and it didn't seem like he was enjoying any of his meal after that. I felt terrible for the guy, because he's a good friend, avid eater at this restaurant, and true foodie.

Food:     4     star

{"text":"This place is great!  My husband is a sommelier and was like a kid in a candy shop with the wine list.  He was so impressed!  Bang helped him out and picked out a couple great wines.  The red curry is probably the best red curry that I have ever had.  The appetizers; chicken sa-tay, garlic and pepper chicken wings, won tons and egg rolls (best egg rolls also, finally a place that has traditional egg rolls), were extraordinary!  We also had sweet and sour pork and Prik king.  Both were okay but still good.  My suggestion is to get tons of appetizers and order tons of red curry!  Make a reservation because they are always busy and I mean always busy!  The service for an asian restaurant is great, we weren't sitting there waiting for anything and they were all very nice and attentive to our needs.  They have expanded so they are able to accommodate large parties and they have a small bar.  It's worth the taxi ride over!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years!  About 3 weeks before the trip, I went to their site @ http://lotusofsiamlv.com and yes, you CAN make a reservation on-line.  However, there is only a 5 minute grace period so we drove straight to the restaurant after work...in LA!

Food and service was awesome.  My little one made us promise to eat here every time we visit Vegas...done deal!  I was going to give this place 4 stars because the bathroom wasn't the cleanest but...I was about to order mango with sticky rice for dessert but the waiter was thoughtful enough to warn me that the mangoes they had that night weren't sweet, which saved us from ending our amazing meal on a sour note.  Love him!"}
{"text":"OK so the husband and I had made a promise to check this place out after seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown. It really interested us, being originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, where there's also a huge diversity in food. 
We went for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty packed, but we were seated right away by friendly staff. Our waitress was initially pretty cold with us (I'm sure she was just having a rough day), but warmed up quickly and was very friendly.
The menu is HUGE. We wanted at least one Northern Thai menu item because we'd never explored it -- and Anthony Bourdain told us to. So we had the Khao Soi (recommended by our waitress) and a Panang curry as a 'safety' item. Both dishes were beyond expectations!! Absolutely delicious and rich in flavor! Portions are a good size, so we ended up taking quite a bit of leftovers, even having ordered just two dishes.
Lotus of Siam quickly became my favorite Thai restaurant! Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! 

 Crappy shopping center, but magnificent inside. Monster wine list, including Malbec served in proper long stem crystal.  

I had the short ribs in soup base w noodle.  The bones were all removed and the meat was lean and no fat.  Probably was one of the best short rib dinners I've ever experienced . Impressive flavor.

Service was rocket fast.  Fifty (50) people came in all at once at 5:30 opening time.  My waiter came over immediately, and began taking my order.  Glass of wine immediately , and less than 5 minutes for the entree' to appear. 

I will be going back!"}

If you are from out of town, you need to make a reservation at least a week in advance.

Noodle with soft-shell crab is our favorite, everything else was delicious also.
The sauce, the flavor .... was incredible.  Portion is a bit small which is fine, this way we have room to try other dishes.

I would give it a 5-Star if rating the food alone.
I gave it a 4-Star because the restaurant decor, the ambiance, and the entrance are a bit out-dated and stuffy."}
{"text":"Thai food here is OK; but I wouldn't go as far to say it's great. Service was OK. Menu selection is large and they also have a buffet option."}
{"text":"I recommend the crispy duck with panang curry. The duck is cooked perfectly - the duck is crispy and dry on the outside and soft and juicy inside. It's one of the better duck dishes I've tried in Thai restaurants. Value wise, the restaurant is reasonably priced and even on the lower end, especially for beers. The food quality is high, although the interior of the restaurant could use some work."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for yeaaaaaars now, as it's been a destination spot for myself & my colleagues/friends during each trade show season in Las Vegas.

It's during this time that it's damn near impossible to get reservations or get seated before an hour wait BUT believe me when I tell you it's well worth the wait.

The service is great. The staff is nice despite obviously being super busy & the service is super fast!!!

Now let's get to the good part. The food... OMG the FOOD!!! Whether you LOVE Thai food or not, Lotus of Siam will leave you wanting more & will open your palette to more than just the typical Thai dishes you're probably accustomed too (i.e. Pad Thai)

Here's what we ALWAYS order... Each dish will make you first salivate, then extremely happy at first bite AND then pissed that you can't (or maybe you can) eat here every single day!

CHARBROILED PRAWNS
With fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce, topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce

CHICKEN LARB
Ground chicken chopped onion, green chili, and lime juice. served with fresh cabbage

CRISPY DUCK
Served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry base sauce, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables

CRISPY RICE
Crispy rice with lime, tender bits of sausage, crunchy peanuts, and wispy slices of green onion

SEA BASS
With fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce, topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce

In addition we get classic Thai dishes like, Panang Curry Chicken & Shrimp Drunken Noodles

If in season, definitely top off your dinner with some Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert... Yummy!!!

Seriously tho... I LOVE LOTUS OF SIAM!!! It's one of my top 10 Restaurants in the world!!!"}
{"text":"This is a a fantastic restaurant. Disregard any reviews that try to rate Lotus of Siam based on the lunch buffet. And some of the more common Thai dishes, like pud Thai, are no better here than at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.
Lotus of Siam offers an exceptional variety of food. Beef jerky is always a winner for me as an appetizer. I also like the spicy crispy rice and the bacon-wrapped shrimp that are deep fried. (See my photos).
Tom ka gai is a chicken coconut soup they do so well. The way I get it normally in restaurants is that they cook the mushrooms in the soup. At Lotus of Siam they add fresh mushrooms right before they serve it. THat's a different way to do it and I like it. Also, if you look at my picture, you'll see a nice dose of chili sauce floating on top of the soup. Be forewarned about eating that straight. Make sure you mix up your soup before you eat it.
The duck dishes are usually pretty good at Lotus of Siam as well. 
If you're not sure what you want, you can trust your server to order for you. Just tell them what you don't like and they can pick dishes for you.
The wine selection is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"The crispy duck w curry.    Yum.  The green Chile paste.   Amazing heat!!! Fresh clean.   Scallops w the green sauce and steamed rice  heavenly.   BYOB for the time being.    Soon to have a full bar and wine list."}
{"text":"As everyone is already saying, the garlic prawns are a must-have. A bit on the pricey side, but I don't know any other thai restaurant that does this. We also had drunken noodles....meh. $15 (?) was way overpriced for a sub-par product. 

Location: the restaurant is difficult to find. it's in a shady part of Las Vegas, so lock your doors! However, once you step inside the restaurant, you feel like you've been transported to a thai palace. weird. 

We lucked out and got in last minute, so make sure you make reservations. Otherwise, order out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place over 15 years ago and our small group decided to revisit it, despite a long Uber ride from the Mandalay Bay. Their space is much enlarged, but unfortunately we arrived at 8pm on a Saturday and the (ir)responsible person forget to book reservations - it was an hour wait at the bar - although the drinks were fine.  Once seated the food was outstanding.  The only miss was the SAI OUA [Northern Style Sausage] - it was a very dry sausage and nothing more. OK for an appetizer but not a main meal. The best dish by far was the Panang Curry.  However, everyone was please with everything else. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Thai food EVER! Great service, beyond delectable food at affordable prices. Service was impeccable, even though the place was packed! I would highly recommend Lotus of Siam when in Vegas.

We ordered several dishes, and shared amongst ourselves. The curries (red and green) were silky and smooth, the chili dip was amazing as an appetizer, and the dessert - fried bananas, sticky rice with mango, and coconut ice cream - topped off our delicious culinary experience here. Hats off to the hard-working staff here. They are amazing! Thank you all for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Clean, modern and delicious! Good portions. Decent prices. Great staff very attentive."}
{"text":"I read about this place in Los Angeles magazine and was impressed by what the writer of the article had to say... \" I would put Lotus up against anything I've had in the U.S. for Thai food. I'm blown away by the level of execution and consistency of their dishes.\" (http://www.lamag.com/features-hidden/2013/05/16/vegas-chefs-choice) 

Really now mister fancy chef dude? With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. 

My wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.

When the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. 

Okay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I've had \"crispy duck\" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection!  

My wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude's bold statement is absolutely valid. Yes, I too am blown away by their amazing Thai food!"}
{"text":"Terrible service to our large party,  doesn't even attempt to seat our large party.   They don't answer their phone.   Even with 5 people waiting ahead,  said they can't seat us.. Wtf.  You don't want our business because she have 10 kids!"}
{"text":"Lunch on the way to the airport.  An excellent way to end our inaugural Vegas trip.

Everything was what I read about and expected.  The dingy, sketchy, vacant strip mall.  The low key restaurant facade and interior. The extensive menu and wine list.  And then there was the food.  I have been eating Thai food for years, with lots of authentic, top notch Thai restaurants in my neighborhood. Lotus blew them away.

The tod mun plar (deep fried fish cake) was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start our meal.  I then had the kang renu nakorn with chicken, which is a red curry but without coconut milk and lots of vegetables.  Spicy and tons of flavor, I think the best part was how it completely cured my hangover.  My husband had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab, which was a phenomenal dish.  

I liked that this place was mostly locals; while were there it was mostly hospital and office workers on their lunch break.

The lunch buffet looked excellent and is probably worth trying as well.

I am glad we were able to get here and I hope we return one day."}
{"text":"Great food. Got the roasted duck curry. You won't be disappointed here. Good is very fresh. Be careful with the spice level"}
{"text":"I'm sort of in the boat with about half of the reviews here and I agree that the food didn't amaze us as much as we had hoped for.  I was really excited to try this place out after reading all the reviews and seeing it featured on the Food Network a dozen times but we came out a little disappointed.  There were some dishes that we liked but others were just eh ... 

It's located in some random strip mall that is pretty remote.  It's really the only place that looked open in the entire huge plaza.  There were some cars parked outside but as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, I had no idea how big it was and how many people can fit inside this place.  After seeing all the people, I realized that all the cars parked outside were solely there to just eat at this location.  So of course, you start to get really excited. 

We made reservations for 8:30pm on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait at all unlike the walk-ins who had to wait about 45 min to an hour.

We ordered the following (ranked in order of like/dislike):  

Tom Kha Gai Soup - this was by far the best tom kha gai soup that we've had.  They cook it based on a Bangkok style (not sure what that means) but it's freaking good.  We got the medium spicy level which was a bit too spicy for my husband (he usually eats average spicy) but I loved it (I can take red hot spicy) and I actually wished it was a bit more spicier for me.  You can order it by cup, bowl or pot which is nice.  We ordered a bowl for the two of us and it was a little too much.  We still had some leftover that I really wanted to finish but we wanted to save room for the other stuff. 

Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab - we were a little disappointed with this dish.  It has a lot of potential to be a great dish but when we got our noodles, they were stuck together in massive clumps and it came out mushy.  They didn't separate out the noodles and that part of the dish was just bad.  The flavoring was awesome and the soft shell crab on top was delicious.  I think it had to do with them being in a rush since the place was packed and I can tell they just wanted to serve you and get you out the door as soon as possible.  I would rather go back when it's not as busy and try this dish again to see if the noodles will actually be separated this time because this was a great dish but the noodles just fell flat for us. 

Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - this was another okay dish.  The prawns are deep fried so that you can also eat the shell.  The crunchy shells are amazing but we felt like there was something lacking from the flavor of the garlic prawns, almost like it needed a dipping sauce or something else.  We actually took them and dipped them in the drunken noodle sauce which made them taste better. 

Massaman Curry with Chicken - I kept reading about all the reviews for the curry so we had to order one to try.  The portion size of this curry was pretty small.  It was a very sweet curry and almost too sweet for my tastes which is odd because I love anything sweet.  The curry itself didn't have as thick of a texture as I'd like.  And there was nothing unique about this curry.  It tastes like curry that you can get from any other Thai place.  

Overall, we were slightly disappointed with the meal and we thought everything was okay not the greatest like everyone else points out in their reviews.  I would only go back if I had a reservation because I don't think it's worth the wait.  And I would only back to try this place out on an off hour when it's not so busy just so I can compare the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"My Vegas promoter insisted this place was the BEST place for food in Las Vegas, NV. So my friends and I stopped by on the way home one February afternoon. We were unaware that they had a buffet special and came after the buffet hours were over. Not sure what the buffet deal is anyways.

Ordered the beef larb, because my favorite promoter, Bhagya of Marquee, raved about how good it was. I thought it would come with rice but it doesn't. It's okay though. Very flavorful, nonetheless. We also order the traditional Pad Thai, in which it was not super oily. Thank gosh, because we all know I don't like oily Pad Thai. We also ordered soup but I forgot what kind it was. The Panang was very creamy and filled with veggies and meat. They don't cheap out. 

Pricing wise, not bad for Vegas food. I can see why my promoter liked the place so much. They were very attentive and there were a lot of waiters/waitresses when we were there. It is located inside a plaza, so keep a look out. Lots of parking due to a huge parking lot that is full of empty space. Worth trying if you're ever in Vegas.

OH! And if you and your girls need a Vegas promoter for clubs, message me. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and yummy authentic Thai food.  It is worth the wait--try to get there early, though!  One of our favorite meals in Las Vegas.  (We visited late August 2016.)"}
{"text":"Why did it take so long for me to finally get out to this place? Everything was excellent from service to food! The Crispy Duck over Drunken Noodles was amazing! Makes me sad that I don't live in Vegas.

The green chili dip was good too. It was different than I was expecting. It was more of a roasted chile, cilantro, vinegar, mix. Cant complain about anything that you eat on top of pork rinds! 

If you are on the fence about visiting this place, go! Its worth the taxi fare if you are visiting and staying on the strip. If you don't like taxis, you can take the Deuce North to Sahara and take the Sahara Express east. There is a stop not too far from the strip mall where Lotus lives. 

If Im ever back in Vegas, Lotus of Siam is definitely on my list!

Oh, one more tip....Make reservations!"}
{"text":"The place is truly an experience. Tucked away in a mostly closed plaza. The charm, outstanding food really sets it apart. We got there at 5:15 and there literally 50 people in line"}
{"text":"You pull up to a dumpy strip mall away from downtown. Don't leave. This is an affordable, authentic restaurant. loved the Northern Thai specials."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go to the famous Lotus of Siam.....
I had looked at the yelp reviews and planned my dinner ahead....

First was the Dassai sake! The big bottle of course! 

The food: 
Garlic Prawns...... The star of the show! This one is definitely all it is cracked up to be! If you go to Lotus of Siam, you MUST get the Garlic Prawns! I will come back for the prawns alone!

Crispy Duck with Basil....... Delicious! Really good quality duck cooked perfectly, with a wonderful basil sauce that accented the dish without overwhelming the flavor of the duck!!!

Crying Tiger.... I do have to say that though the flavors were good, the steak was over cooked! It was medium well almost well done.... we didn't finish the steak or take it home..... this one was disappointing!

Drunken Noodles with chicken.... good... not great... flavors were good, but I ordered spicy 5 thinking this is my first time here and 5 would be spicy but safe.... no... not spicy at all... and for me, I need some spice with my thai noodles!

All around though, it was very good! Service is great! I will def be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique and interesting restaurants in the country.  Order off of the Northern Thai Menu, this is where the exceptional cuisine is.  The Reisling list is insane.  So are the lines and wait lists."}
{"text":"After hearing about Lotus of Siam from Anthony Bourdain and seeing the glowing reviews here on Yelp, I knew that a meal here must be a part of my visit to Las Vegas. 

Located in a nondescript lot that would make one easily forget the glitz and glamor that are synonymous with Las Vegas. It was rather sketchy, not just by its looks but in actuality, if one were to go with Lotus of Siam and the Las Vegas police's notice to their patrons that asks them not to leave valuables in cars. We came twenty minutes after they opened for Saturday lunch, and there was already a fifteen-minute wait. The waiting area is rather intimate and I was truly thankful that we were able to sit in there instead of having to wait outside and experience the dry desert heat (already in the mid-80's at around 11 AM). However, we took advantage of this little wait to look up their menu and see what looks particularly appetizing.

The staff was incredibly friendly and were evidently used to handling their many visitors. We hardly had to wait for anything during our visit: the water glasses were refilled promptly, the food arrived in about ten minutes, and the check was given to us within five minutes of finishing our meal. Really, if I was a little nervous about grumpy service due to their popularity, my nervousness was misplaced.

Now to the food. For our appetizer, we tried the tod mun plar, which is a popular Thai street food. It was delicious. We were able to taste the fish without getting that unpleasant fishy flavor lingering in our palate after consumption. Even the daughter, who is not a fan of fish that does not come in fish and chips form, enjoyed the tod mun plar. It was a great omen for the rest of our meal.

For entrée, we had the northern larb, kang care, and crispy duck with panang sauce to eat with their combination fried rice. Everything was perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious. The northern larb is on the spicy side, so if you are not into spicy, maybe skip it. But if you like spicy food that offer complexity of flavors that go beyond the piquant, the northern larb will not disappoint. The kang care also delivered  and may be one of the best curries I have ever had.

The crispy duck with panang sauce from the chef's selection was undeniably the star of our meal. It was pricey, but it worked hard for every single cent of our hard-earned money. The duck was seasoned well and cooked perfectly that it did not get soggy even if it sat in the sauce it came with. But that sauce was unforgettable. It was very flavorful and just fantastic. My cousin and I had a \"friendly\" argument, which I lost, as to who can take the sauce home to eat with just plain steamed rice. Seriously, it was so delicious, I would be happy to eat that with nothing else but steamed rice for days on end and call myself a lucky girl. That good.

The fried rice was good, but I would suggest settling for steamed rice instead because it is rather heavy. I would prefer eating more of their delicious entrée rather than fried rice. While it did not disappoint, I was rather resentful of our choice to order it because I should have known better, what with my limited stomach space and all.

The food is on the pricey side and the servings are on the small side, but if you are in Las Vegas and want to go beyond the buffets they are justifiably famous for and want to go where locals go, do go to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was just as awesome... Thank you Tony for recommending the sea bass drunken noodles.  Your subtle approach was appreciated and you always kept our glasses full,  allowing us to really enjoy our meal. (2 thumbs up)"}
{"text":"I can't say this is the best Thai food I've ever eaten but they have a huge selections of items, some of which I have never tasted before.  There has also been a lot of press about this place.  I didn't realize that these were the same owners who opened up Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, CA.  They sold it years ago, though the restaurant it still open.  No wonder some of the menu items seemed similar.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two on a Sunday night and ordered:

-Nam Kao Tod - Loved the crunchy pieces of rice though it was a very sour dish.  Size was average.
-Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip) - This was not as spicy as it looked.  In fact, it was barely spicy.  It came with really fresh vegetables and pork rinds.  The dip itself tasted very similar to a spaghetti sauce to me.
-Kana Moo Krob (Pork Belly + Chinese Broccoli) - Can't go wrong with this dish.  Yummy but not very different from other places I've had this dish at.
-Sai Oui (Sausage) - This also had a mild kick to it but barely.  It had a strong lime taste - I didn't care for this one too much, but I am not a sausage fan in general.

We didn't try any of the standard Thai dishes (i.e. Pad Thai) bc we wanted to try things that weren't readily available in Thai Town (LA).  We also ordered a lemongrass drink - the first waiter had no idea what we were talking about but a second one knew.  I guess they don't have a regular drink menu, and I only knew about the drink bc of a Yelp review (thanks again, Yelp!).  Overall service was good and food was a bit more expensive than your average Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought I should give this restaurant another try. Yep, it still tastes like chinese food (Greasy, salty, and lots of MSG)."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already?  It's no nonsense great food. Get the catfish!"}
{"text":"One of our top reasons to visit Vegas again.  We were so let down by other restaurants in Vegas that we ended up back here twice!

The BEST Tom Yum soup ever.  Good veggie soup as well.
Ginger chicken.
The pork larb-  I thought sounded terrible but bf ordered it anyway.  It was the most surprisingly delicious dish.  The blending of different flavors was amazing.
Simply the best!

5 star friendliest service too from our waiter who deserved the extra big Christmas tip!

Still beats any of the top Thai places I've tried in NYC."}
{"text":"Crispy Garlic Shrimp - I almost cried it was sooooooooo good. 

Northern Red Curry - YUM! 

The wine list is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place and finally decided to check it out. It's located in an odd spot in one of Vegas's older strip malls... if you're dining here at night you're in for an adventure, there's definitely a lot of unique neighbors. I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.

It was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. 

Anyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don't think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine. 

We ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but my favorites were #14. Nam Kao Tod, which was rice flavored with lemon, it was very savory and #13B Moo Dad Dew, which was the best beef jerky I've ever had.

Overall it wasn't a bad experience. I would rate this place 3/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn't even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.

We ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).

Lotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten \"out of order signs\" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there's tables randomly scattered everywhere. You can literally place your arm on someone else's table if your not careful!

Tips: This place is a bit overhyped, the food isn't bad but it's like any other traditional Thai restaurant just with more reviews."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for Thai food in America. I've been to some great places in Thailand and this is right up there with them. My favorite dish that we ordered was the drunken noodle soft shell crab. It was perfectly seasoned and the crunchy texture was perfect. I ate so much but I wanted more. My friends had to hold me back from raiding the kitchen for more food. Okay, that didn't happen but it was pretty dang good."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand twice and this is the best Thai food I've had.  It actually is spicy enough and not watered down or Americanized like many other Thai restaurants. The place looks like a dump from outside, but don't let that discourage you.  it is, by far, the best thai food you'll ever have!!!!!"}
{"text":"The 45mins wait for crispy duck on panang curry was well worth it. Must try! A reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've had. Everything is so authentic!! I would recommend the duck curry, beef larb, pad Thai, and papaya salad."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - the food is amazing - the best in Las Vegas.
 It is in a bad neighborhood and the outside is no frills - but I think that adds to its charm -the food is absolutely incredible.
 Make reservations and arrive early - they will give away your table if you are 5-minutes late because of demand.  They are always crowded.
it is about $25 cab ride off the strip - $50 round-trip, so good thing the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I craze this place when not in Vegas. It's a must do every time we're in town. Brilliant garlic shrimp!! LOVE LOVE them!!"}
{"text":"A must visit for any Thai food fan going to Las Vegas. it's 3.5 miles from the strip, which was $12 on the Lyft app. We spent about $63 for 2 people and that included appetizer, 2 mains and 3 drinks. We shared fried rolls (average) but the Green Curry and the Grilled Beef with chilis, mint and other spices were PHENOMENAL. EVerything fresh and hot, good service and we had a good chat with our server about Thailand. I'd highly recommend making reservations. It's . a pretty standard non flashy restaurant but super clean and they have a crazy wine selection. Their speciality is seafood which I hope to try next time but my dining partner did not eat seafood."}
{"text":"We had Lots of Siam recommended to us by a former local but we decided to opt for poke on our first day in Vegas instead.  When a shuttle bus driver in St. George, Utah also recommended it our interest was piqued enough that I did some research.  Great reviews in all the food mags and a 2011 James Beard award had my interest piqued. Since I love Thai food (and Northern Thai food in particular) we had to check it out.

The restaurant is shockingly huge.  It is situated inside a half closed strip mall that has 4 Korean BBQ places, a Korean Grocery store, a saloon that was pretty hoping at 4:30 on a Sunday and the Green Door.  

We had tried to get advance reservations, but were too late (next next available online reservation was like 2 weeks in advance) and couldn't get through on the phone, so we decided we were going to have to deal with the line.  Lotus of Siam opens at 5:30 for dinner and we had heard that the line gets pretty long.  Since we were trying to grab a quick meal before catching our flight home we came early and wandered the strip mall for 20 minutes to see what else was there.  There was no line at 5:10 and we were just about to go to the saloon for a drink when suddenly two families queued up.  We decided to forgo the drink at the stand and stand in line, despite the heat.  10 minutes later the line was probably 40 people long.  We were, however, able to get right in and it took a little while for the restaurant to fill up.  Still, when we left there was a big line. In line we talked with folks about what they were ordering and they were all picking Americanized Thai food even though the reviews all said go with Northern Thai stuff.  

The Khao Soi was the best dish that we ordered, though it was a bit confused.  When I had it in Chiang Mai it always had dark chicken meat in it.  The waiter tried to get me to order it with beef, but that seemed weird so I said chicken.  I ended up with sliced (and dry) chicken thrown on top.  Looking at the pictures online it seems that Duck is how Lotus of Siam does it and that it would have been the best way to go.  Sai Oua was a good northern style sausage.  We ordered sticky rice with it and that was the second best.  Then we had Nam Prik Ong.  Also good, but flavored a bit similarly to our Sai Oua.  We could have skipped this and tried something else.  Finally we had the garlic prawns, which we could have done without all together. 

The restaurant is really efficient in terms of timing.  Everything seems very professional, but the whole thing is also really cold. No real personal interactions.  We ended up ordering 4 dishes.  The northern Thai food was good, but not better than what I get back home in DC.  The garlic prawns that everyone raved about, including our waiter, was ok but silly expensive. 

Overall it was an ok experience, but I wouldn't run back."}
{"text":"The food doesn't taste the same anymore. The drunken noodles with the soft shell crab were lumped together and not tasty if not for the crab.
The Tom Yum shrimp soup and Catfish larb were perfect!
Crispy Garlic Prawns (Chef Choice) has no garlicky flavor not the same as before.
I will try the other Thai places recommended in Yelp next time."}
{"text":"What a find!!!

This restaurant located in an obscure mall somewhere outside of the Las Vegas Strip was a real diamond in the rough!

First off, their wine list was longer than their menu--which is a great sign because I believe that you don't need to have a great wine list unless you have great food first to match it.

We started out with the Tom Yum soup which was delicious and full of flavor and fresh chunks of mushrooms, but that was only the beginning.

Our second dish was the Fried Pompano and it was so well flavored and moist in the middle--not to mention probably one of the biggest pompano I have seen (I was expecting something considerably smaller) but still managed to be tasty and NOT dry as you might expect from a large fish for it's kind.

The third dish was the Crispy Duck w the Penang Curry--soo good, but so bad for you, but just generally sooo awesome!  It is as described by other yelpers so I will let their reviews make you drool.

In the end, the two of us left there happily stuffed and hoping that we will be back in Vegas soon to try more.  With all the great food in the bay area, not too many places outside northern California impress me, but I am a big fan of this place now and can't wait to get back there!

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"For a place that is a tourist destination I was skeptical but the execution and service is very high.  All the usual Thai fodder is on the menu but with many notable additions,  too many to go into, just head along and try it.  The wine list is mega extensive but at the end of the day you just need a simple cheap glass of reisling to pair this delicious food. Four for dinner with a glass of vino each $150."}
{"text":"Rude and somehow for a party of ten......we need to reserve two weeks in advance.  The staff just stands around at front and discuss personal matters.   When I went into back by the bar to go to the bathroom, there were like at least 30 open seats in their huge bar dining area.   Seems either owner is not present, or owner doesn't care anymore since he's so busy with his business and doesn't have to work hard to maintain his customer base.
Our party instead went to Thai Original BBQ down the street.  They gave us good food and great service, now I know where to go the next time I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"If you have tried Thai town food in LA, if you're a fan of Jitlada/Ruen Pair/President Thai, then this place won't live up to the hype for you. Thats something I wish I was told before walking in, then I would've saved myself a precious meal slot for other experiments. 

The menu is similar to many that I've seen in LA, with an addition of Northern Thai selection that's rather 

Don't get me wrong, this place is GOOD. It's just not \"the best I've ever been to\" kind of good. Also, when on the road, the # of meal slots are limited (for trying new things), I get extra crunchy when places are not worth their spot on my packed trip. 

We had the Lao style pork curry, it was bland (spices are rather muted and can't taste any harmony) and it was served lukewarm. I sent it back to have it reheated, but the proper temperatured dish was also rather uninspiring. 

The other dish was the crispy pork stir fry, which I've had better and cheaper in LA. Nothing wrong, but also, judging the price I had to pay, wasn't exactly worth the $$ they were commanding."}
{"text":"Was this the best Thai food I've had, well, um no, does it work for where we were at? sure no problem.  Plus I think that it has such an aura about it that maybe I expected too much?  

Side note - Funny thing - i've been coming to this shopping complex for years to go to a few Korean restaurants, so I did feel like I was really going for Korean food instead of Thai.

Since a bunch of us were in town for Yelp Spring Break - we made it a point to have LOS on the list of to dos...(and then quite a few people set up UYEs...go figure) so we were there first thing for lunch on Friday.  There are no \"lunch specials\" but there is a $10.99 lunch buffet.  I guess it can't be vegas without a buffet?

I know that you don't exactly go to a Thai restaurant for chicken wings, but the garlic black pepper chicken wings caught my eye and I just couldn't let it go.  So chicken wings it is.

couldn't do it alone - so got some chicken dumplings as well with some steamed rice.  My bestie who joined me in town for Yelp Spring Break got the Yellow Curry so we did some sharing.

Curry was decent, but I felt that the veggies weren't really cooked enough.  I kinda felt like they just threw it in in the last 2 minutes to warm them and that was it.  Not that I was expecting mush, but a little bit more cooked perhaps?

Chicken dumplings were fried, nothing special, I'm sure I've gotten those before in the freezer section at the grocery store.

But the wings deserve 5 stars on their own.  They were so GOOD.  there was some sweetness to them, but the garlic and pepper were fantastic with the wings.  They were cooked (fried) to perfection and still moist enough on the inside.  Absolutely loved the flavor profile.  Go figure the truly non tradition item was the thing I thought was the best.  I'd go back for the wings, but don't know if I'd be willing to get other things...besides, the wings were like 9 bucks on their own for 6, which is a bit steep when you think about it.

Service was quite good, but be forewarned, if you are there with a large group, they can only split it four ways, so be a good customer and bring cash if you've got a large group, not a pile of debit cards.

Parking you ask?  This is not on the strip, it's free and there is PLENTY at all times."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Pad Thai and try to get here every time we are in Las Vegas. I like spicy but can only handle a 6. Anything higher is too hot."}
{"text":"It's too hyped up. I'm a sucker for Thai, and having tried most Thai places in the valley, Lotus of Siam is exactly what it looks like on the outside. It's good, it's alright. But don't follow the crowd. There are more hidden gems out here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here recently, I have to admit I can't get enough of this place. I love Lotus of Siam. This is the best freakin thai food I've ever had. My friend and I are even planning on flying from L.A. to Vegas just to have dinner here. This place is a must when visiting Las Vegas, I mean c'mon just read all the great reviews."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!
Came here because of my foodie friend's string recommendation on a  Friday night.  Arrived about 15 minutes before Lotus of Siam's 5:30 PM opening time.  Got our party of 4 seated right away.  So many delicious choices.  The waiter was helpful in making our selections.  The scallops, shrimp, and satay were absolutely delicious.  The Yelp reviews were also helpful.  Definitely coming back - this place is less than 5 miles off the strip.  Easy can ride."}
{"text":"Got a referral to lotus of Siam. It was a taxi hike off the strip but worth it. Didn't have a reservations but it was only an hour wait. I was surprised by the wine selection. Had a nice Pinot noir.  

Ordered the tom yum soup w shrimps which had a nice balance of spice and flavors. Ordered the deep fried sea bass drunken noodles which was nom nom. Green curry w chicken was delish. And mixed vegetables Ka Pow style. Everything was great. Service was good too. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I always drive across town for this delicious Thai! It is our go-to place whenever we are celebrating something. Would recommend the Garlic Prawns and Crispy duck! PS eat the shells of the prawns they are like chips!"}
{"text":"Despite the intimidating reviews describing long lines for this restaurant, luckily my party of two was seated fairly quickly. Granted, we came in the middle of the week for lunch. The waiter was attentive and checked on us often, and the food was excellent. We got the crispy duck with Panang curry and garlic prawns per the recommendations of the server. The garlic prawns were the perfect amount of crispy--not greasy--and seasoned well. But the crispy duck was amazing! We got a spice level 3 for the curry and it was a nice subtle heat. Probably could've handled a couple levels hotter but didn't want to push our luck since Thai food tends to be on the spicy side. 

This place was a little hard to find since it is in a unassuming strip mall."}
{"text":"So the outside of this place looks pretty run down. It also doesn't look like the safest part of town. But apparently a ton of famous people have eaten here, as you'll see from their wall covered in pictures. 

We arrived pretty hungry and ordered right away. Both hubby and our friend went for the Chicken Pad Thai. While my hubby thought it was just as good as others he'd had, our friend thought it was better than most she's tried here in Vegas. I did think it was strange that the waiter didn't ask what spice level she wanted and just assumed none. Whereas my husband specifically requested a 4/10 (which he found to be pretty mild). 

I ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken. While the amount of chicken they gave was generous, I found the overall portion to be smaller than I've had. 

We finished our entrees still hungry, so we ordered some Fried Chicken Dumplings. The dumplings were fine. I felt it was the sweet and sour sauce that really made it yummy. 

Over all, good flavors, small-ish portions, in-attentive service. I'm certainly not against a return visit, but probably wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars I'd give it 6.

When you pull up to Lotus of Siam, from the outside it looks like it's in the wrong place.  The surrounding strip mall looks a bit run down and Lotus is very humble looking.

But once you get inside and see the Wine Spectator Grand awards on the wall along with the wine selection you'll quickly get it.  Some people say this is the best Thai food in the U.S.  I haven't eaten at enough Thai restaurants to verify that fact, but it's the best one I've ever eaten at.

Stellar wine list, reasonable prices and fast, friendly service only compliment the food.  This is a must for anyone visiting Vegas.  No, really!  It's a must, double stamped it, no erasies."}
{"text":"Came here based on Anthony Bourdain's (RIP) review a couple years ago (this is not the original place).  Ordered duck curry, larb, kai soy, deep fried shrimp (a must!!), and some other northern Thai dishes... they were all so good!! This place gets crowded once it opens and it would be best to make reservations or be the first ones there when it opens."}
{"text":"Four people, about seven dishes (all of them shared) plus four drinks, around a hundred dollars. Quite a value considering how good were the edibles. It's nice for once to go to a restaurant that promises spiciness and actually delivers food that makes your ears feel like they're bleeding. Soup broth made me cream jeans. Beef slices were cooked medium-rare to perfection. Fried mussel omelet was not a hit (no one would admit to ordering it). Squid salad was hot in more ways than one. Banana/rice/coconut ice cream dessert was the perfect coda to a great dining experience. Servers were very helpful and efficient. The Thai beer (Singha) accompanied the food well enough to make me order a second (otherwise the brew options were dismal). Decor is nothing to write home about, but cozy. Go!"}
{"text":"I will not wait for 2 hours for this place but I will always make sure to eat here whenever I am in vegas~~~~

TIP: go on a weekday during lunch right when they open and I guarantee that you will not wait in line or wait as much compared to dinner.

We feasted on:
Garlic Prawns-- so meaty and the fried skins super crispy!! (make sure you dip them into the duck curry)
Tom Yum- the best i have had in my life- perfect balance of flavors- most of the thai food restuarants would have way too much sourness that ruins the rest of the ingredients natural flavors
Pad see wu- yum yum yummu chewy rice noodles in my tummy
.. the duck curry?- didn't really like the consistency of the noodles but... the sauce- i will mixed it up with rice anytime

gotta go back to try the rest of their menu soon ^^"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!  We had the garlic prawns, chicken fried rice and drunken noodles with duck. Everything was absolutely fabulous and we will definitely be stopping by next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"This place was more than I expected. The food, while small portions, was so fresh and delicious. The menu is extensive, especially if you aren't familiar with traditional Thai food (I wasn't). Orders come out one at a time, so don't plan on all starting your meal together. I'm not big on spicy, so I ordered my Drunken Noodles at a \"2\"; when it came out it was about an \"8\"!! They apologized and remade it, but my companions were almost done before I ever started. Small portions leave room for their delicious sticky rice with mango dessert. It's pricey but fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome in every respect. Great staff. Great food. Super spicy (on request). 

Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing puff rice appetizer. Loved the drunken noodles with soft shell crab. It's much larger as they expanded 3 years ago so not as bothersome getting in. Still packed house for lunch. So cool that they have many dishes that are true Thai specialities. Do NOT come just to order pad Thai!  This is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Price update! Crazy increases! It is starting to become to expensive to eat here!

Garlic Prawns - from $24.95 to $27.95
Drunken Noodle Sea Bass - from $29.95 to $30.95
Panang Crispy Duck - from $24.95 to $27.95

New food I tried,

Pad Thai Chicken - $11.95 - The pad thai had a very strong deep tamarind sauce. The noodles were over cooked and mushy. Chicken was basic.

Thai Fried Rice Beef - $10.95 - Good rice dish. Nothing that blew my mind. 

Tom Kah Kai - $14.95 - Very complex soup. You get the sweet coconut battling with the sour lime flavor. You get a ton of chicken and mushrooms. Good amount to share, we had 6 people, I do not think I could have this alone as a meal.

Storypoint Cabernet Sauvignon - $30 a bottle

Still the best overall meal I have had in Vegas. Prices are getting to be ridiculous though."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Thai food I've tasted here in Las Vegas. We had some chicken skewers, tom yum kai, panang curry with chicken, chicken with cashew, and crispy duck with drunken noodles. Everything was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves up the best Thai food in the US that I've been to. The wait is horrendous but at least the food has maintained that quality for all the years that I've been coming here. The northern Thai dishes at the back of the menu are the star items to order and my go to every trip here. Be adventurous with you order, won't be disappointed and will find a new favorite"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai Food Experience of my life! This is a must visit for any Vegas Trip. Wine list is extremely deep, menu has too many options... All of which were outstanding! Do not pass this up."}
{"text":"This was really good Thai. There are Northern dishes here you can only find in Thailand, and was just there last November. With CES over the weekend, we were happy to get in without waiting too long, but it was packed!"}
{"text":"Looking for a news place to try in Vegas, so a friend suggested here, yelp reviews seem promising. The food is good, we had crispy mussels omelet , drunken noodle with seafood ( because the waiter mentioned drunken noodles a lot), and a jackfruite curry. The omelet was a good surprise, very interesting texture, crunchy egg, with lots of beansprout, so was the noodle, but the service was not very friendly, I almost wanted to ask if we did anything wrong. There's no vegetarian dishes (surprising), we ask if he can replace the seafood curry to just veggie, but it still come with seafood. We were ignored the whole meal, he offered water when we were about to leave. One of the lady took our check & card, and disappeared. We had to track our waiter and ask if he has seen our card... I don't think I want to come back, the food is good, but just because it's cheap doesn't mean the service should be bias (I can't think of any other reason). Plus, extra bowl of rice is $2. FYI"}
{"text":"Very good food. A staple in Vegas, leave the strip and go there. Everything is great. Eat here before it's too late"}
{"text":"This great spot was the highlight of my \"off the strip\" eating adventures this past trip to Last Vegas. Now...most people will simple keep on driving when they come to see the strip mall that Lotus of Siam is situated in. But trust me fellow Yelpers...come on it. You just need to get past the panhandler in the parking lot asking for change in return for washing your windows.
Inside you get a whole other feel. This is an \"older\" restaurant...but doesn't make you feel like it is run down, or past it's prime at all. The service was spot on, the area was clean...And the food was one of the only things that got me thru my week of Vegas work. I came in here twice over a 3 day period, and almost made it three times! The Thai iced tea was fantastic, the Spicy Vegi soup was so tasty I wished I had ordered two...the PaNang curry was spot on (fried tofu is definitely the way to go over steamed, by the way) and the flat noodles with sauce (who's name escapes me) was a welcome change.
If you are in town, you need to make the trip off the strip and over to Lotus of Siam...Trust Me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Yelp because it never steers us wrong!!  This restaurant was delicious!!!  We got the potstickers appetizer, yum!  Then we followed it with the crispy duck in coconut milk, garlic prawn & pork belly!!  Man oh man was that an experience!  You will have an hours wait or so to get in, but believe me it's well worth it!!!  For just the duck alone was mouth-watering!:). The service was excellent!:) don't let the area of location throw you off!  It's amazing!  A definite must!"}
{"text":"Incredible service. koi soi is amazing. Ra na is absolutely delicious. Hot and sour with shrimp is a must. Cucumber salad too. Thai iced tea is divine. This place is not to miss. In Vegas for just a few days and already eaten here twice."}
{"text":"Yes, I was lured here by the many accolades and TV appearances -- oh, and my chili-loving husband. It was busy even on a Sunday night, but not insane. They run a tight ship. Their white wine cellar and sake selection were incredible, and we were grateful to be steered away from our first wine choice by the wine steward, who saved us $30 and delivered exactly what we were seeking. Of course, the star is the food. They have spectacular versions of some classic Thai dishes, but the menu is also huge. A lot of people swear by the \"Northern\" section of the menu, which has less-familiar choices for most gringos like me. We tried a few dishes and were very happy with all aspects of the meal. A fun trip off the Strip."}
{"text":"I ate here several times when I first moved to Vegas, and never was very impressed with anything except the Tom Kha Kai.  Then I taught myself how to make it and decided the rubbery squid and the average curries were not worth the trip to Commercial Center.

I came back recently and had an interesting dish, soft shell crab drunken noodle, a bit on the pricey side - the crab itself was tasty, with the spicy level appropriate (7/10), basil and mint.  The drunken noodle was a bunch of clumped-together wide noodles, so I should have ordered the soft shell crab salad (cabbage, lime dressing, peanuts) instead - I am a big fan of the Vietnamese soft shell crab salad with watercress (cua lot chien bo, a fave of mine at Vietopia in Houston).

This time we also tried the Tom Kha Kai, and it wasn't as memorable, just a limey coconut-y soup, which I now can make equally as good if not better...the Thai tea was great, the SERVICE was outstanding during the meal except we never got the spicy condiments we asked for and then all waitstaff disappeared and we had to ask the owner or manager for the check.

The renovation and expansion is certainly an inviting factor - the atmosphere is nice.  Also, Mayor Goodman was dining there, and he turned on his way out the door and waved to our section, and we all waved and cooed, \"Bye Mayor!\"

Overall, prices can be reasonable, but this still hasn't tickled my fancy.  I have yet to be impressed with any Thai restaurants in LV besides Komol (and Pin Kaow is worth another chance), and next time I am out this way I am going to Komol."}
{"text":"Leave the strip and get the best Thai I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing after reading all the reviews. The place was packed on a Wednesday night with an hour wait. Ordered take out and was told it would be 15 minutes and they would call. After waiting 30 minutes I went back to the desk and the food was sitting there. Cashier said it was there for 10 minutes as she forgot to call me. 
Nam sod was made with minced pork and every other Thai place makes it with chicken. Told her I liked it spicy so I ordered #6 spicy. It was so bland and could only imagine what a #1 or 2 would be.
If you like basic American style Thai, then maybe it's fine, but not representative of authentic style.
Also never gave me rice that was to be included.
Most probably will not return, if you like Walmart then this is your place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place lived up to the hype. I ordered beef pad see ew to go and it was hands-down the best I have ever had. Not overly greasy and the noodles tasted very fresh-almost like they make their own from scratch. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai for an extremely reasonable price. Located off the strip in a run down strip mall, this foodie heaven is definitely worth the walk but be sure to get reservations because it opens at 11:30 and by 11:45 it is at max capacity."}
{"text":"By far the best thai food I have ever had in my life. In fact, I would argue that I never had authentic thai food until dining at lotus of siam. Dined her on a Sunday night at 7pm and it was PACKED. It is off the strip so you definitely need to take an uber/cab or drive. Not in the best area and kind of odd that it is in a somewhat abandoned strip mall, but once you enter the restaurant you completely forget where you walked in from. 

I went with a coworker and we split a few different dishes. We both started with the coconut chicken soup where you can choose your spice level. I chose a 7/10 and she chose the 3/10. I can handle a lot of heat and the 7 wasn't spicy. Great soup to start! We then got the pineapple fried rice, pad see ew with chicken (low spice level), and the crispy duck panang. All of the dishes were fantastic. Nothing was too heavy and greasy as I typically feel with thai food. If you go to vegas, you NEED to come here. Suggest making a reservation a month or so in advance."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place, especially seeing all the wonderful reviews and all the awards this place has gotten....but I just couldn't :(

The ambiance of the restaurant is alright, nothing fancy but the service is wonderful. It is located in a strip mall and if you don't have a car you will need to hire a taxi. If you have a car there is plenty of parking but beware it is easy to miss the turn into the complex.

On to the food!! The food was well disappointing :( The chicken satay was good, but not \"oh wowey here go my taste buds\" good. My mom did say that they tasted exactly like the ones she had in Indonesia when she was young, so maybe it is more of an authentic taste and my Americanized taste buds didn't like it??? 

On to the panang curry!! We just had panang curry at Wazuzu the other day at the Wynn and I gotta say the curry at Wazuzu and this one were identical and I would go as far to say the one at the Wynn was better :-O So not what I expected from a place with so many accolades. The other curry we ordered was alright....not much flavor and well kinda bland....*sad face*

All in all the food was alright, not the best I have had. My suggestion.....go somewhere else I know I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas native, and why it took me so long to eat here - I don't know. It is wonderful! 

My cousin came into town and requested we go here. She had heard nothing but great things and boy was she right!

The service was great. The hostess was super friendly. Our server was so on top of things. He provided great recommendations since some of us are vegetarians and others at our table were not. The eggplant was delicious!

I will for sure go back and definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"1600+ reviews in..what more is there to tell? Our cabbie took us here from the strip. At first we were not sure if it would be worth it to drive that far out of the way... IT WAS. Excellent food and service. We even had a 'celebrity spotting'.  I will go next time I'm in Vegas. 5 stars!!! **Bonus** Vegas Cue Club is a mere 3 doors down."}
{"text":"My husband is in Vegas almost every week and has been coming here for months and raving about how wonderful it is. I finally was in Vegas with him last weekend and WOW was it delicious! We went to Thailand in 2016 and this place brings your right back there with the food and such nice service from the staff. It is quick and every dish is a work of art, visually and in the flavors. 

We had one person with us that has a shell fish allergy and we told our server and they made sure there was no cross contamination. Always tell your server before they put in your order EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T ORDER SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAVE IT AS AN INGREDIENT. 

I had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with shrimp medium spice and it was so good. Just to warn you if you are sensitive to spice, please tell them mild. Medium is still on the hotter side and I like it spicy.  The pad thai my husband said was right up there with the street pad thai we got when traveling through Thailand and our friend got chicken fried rice, which he said was amazing. The portions are a good size and are large enough to share. Start with the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce because, yum!"}
{"text":"Crazy good Thai food.  Just be advised that some of the dishes are spicy.  The Som Thum (green papaya salad) turned me into a red, sweaty, hiccuping, runny-nosed mess.  We also had the Khao Soi with beef and the green chicken curry, which were both great (and less spicy).  The neighborhood is a little dodgy, but the food is worth the trip.  Be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Now, I have seen Bourdain eat here, I've read up on the joint from various food blogs and on-line culinary magazines, but other than remembering to order from the Northern Thai section of the menu all other specific knowledge went out the window because I was so god damn drunk! Apparently, I am told, I couldn't even recall where the bathroom was despite the fact I had just relieved myself there only fifteen minutes prior.

F*cking Slot Waitresses. F.S.W.

But I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.

Yes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.


Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w/ ground pork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudités and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.

Hey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.


Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!


Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.

\"A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!\"

-- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross

Garlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.

Then there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.

Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.

Just order what you want. It's your meal. Everything here will be good. You are not going to go wrong."}
{"text":"I came here in September, right before my flight back home. 

We ordered a ton of food, prawns, pad thai, fried rice...pretty much everything on the menu. My boyfriend's brother couldn't stop raving about this place, so I had pretty high expectations. I was expected to be blown away...but it's really just okay. Like I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was craving Thai in the Vegas area, and didn't want to eat on the strip I would eat here. 

Location is kind of strange. Next to a senior center. Once you go inside you can't tell though."}
{"text":"Some dishes they're known for:

Drunken Noodle = Quite spicy, good flavor
Crispy Duck = Nice deep fried crunchy texture
Crispy Rice Appetizer = Very sour, crunchy rice, unique
Jackfruit Curry = bland soup (not curry as you think), not worth getting
Pad Thai = Good, authentic

tip: for the drunken noodle, you can save some money by getting the mixed seafood version (12.95), and not the seabass ($20+), or the softshell crab ($19) version... if you just want to try the flavor.

Also, go early or super late, this place gets PACKED fast! We went Sunday night at 5:30 right when they opened for dinner. The place was half full when we sat down. By the time we left, the lines were out the door and it was a zoo. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Dined here last Saturday with a group of fellow Angelenos.  I give this place 3 stars because though the food was good, it wasn't exceptional, and the biggest faux pas for me?  Tiny portions at a Thai place that looks like a hole in the wall.  I mean, the prices looked fair enough on the menu, and the decor reminded me of most Thai places I've frequented in LA, but the portions were more in line with upscale, overpriced restaurants you find in LA.  I was like, where's the rest of the food?  And it's not like we even had to wait as we made a reservation ahead of schedule and were seated immediately, so my dining experience should've been more positive, right?
On a positive note, as I mentioned before, the food was good and the service for the most part is quite good.  However, I've had comparable Thai food in similar Thai places for a third of the price."}
{"text":"too expensive and the lunch buffet helped offset the costs but now that is gone."}
{"text":"I came here with a large party and the service was on point!  They were very attentive, the food took a while but the restaurant was busy.   The food was very savorful and authentic.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"So beyond flavorful!! Ordered pad Thai, some sort of beef with lime, cilantro, and who knows what else in it but it was flavorful! Chicken satay for appetizer. Thai tea. I wish I would have taken pictures! Service was great!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about the restaurant but the food and the service was good. 
Actually, it was a little spicy for me. I wish I would have asked for mild. I was breaking a sweat and my mouth was burning, however very good and great ingredients.
The 89' Riesling that I had with my meal was excellent. (brought to the restaurant.) 
Would definitely go back for more!"}

{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of someone who used to live in Vegas, who said this was THE place to get the best Thai food. We arrived about 30 minutes after the start of dinner service on a weekend with no reservation, and although there was already a line of people waiting for tables, we didn't have to wait long (Maybe 5-10 minutes).

The menu is quite extensive, and spans various regions of Thailand. The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. 

The drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. 

I asked for the dish \"medium\" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.

Service was excellent despite it being very busy. Plates were taken as needed and drinks were refilled fairly promptly.

I'd definitely like to come here again to try something different. I'd also like to try their lunch buffet sometime!"}
{"text":"I love the new location, restaurant is beautiful and clean. Servers were nice and attentive. Parking wasn't bad for an early lunchtime. However I wasn't blown away with the food. It wasn't terrible by any means just not amazing enough to garner 5 stars. The panang was the most disappointing because the beef was tough. Sadly I feel like the Thai food in OC is better. I'm still glad I got to check out this popular spot though."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was so full of favor. I recommend trying new dishes that you normally wouldn't at a typical Thai place.. You will be pleasantly pleased. I also recommend ordering family style so you can try as much variety as possible. Excellent service, excellent food, will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother rating a restaurant with over a thousand ratings and a 4 star average. Anyway. Don't come here for the atmosphere; come here cause the food is fantastic. 

I've yet to find a better Tom Yung Goong soup in Vegas; most places don't bother trying to make a good broth and instead just bomb some stock with chili oil, which results in a bright red, oily liquid without any depth (I'm looking at you, Komol). Okay, I'm gonna stop being all OCD about soup now."}
{"text":"Great food and staff.  And great prices.  A definite stop if you ever get to Vegas."}
{"text":"Spending 16 years in Fresno, I think I've been spoiled when it comes to Southeast Asian food. None of the dishes really merited their price point, nor did the service. The flavor profiles of the unique dishes were definitely worth it to try something new. 

The garlic shrimp is an amazing dish, but there's a certain amount of technique that was missed on our order that went out. The shells were perfectly crisp to give that \"potato chip\" texture other reviewers rave about, but the resulting prawns were desiccated and rubbery. We didn't even finish the dish.

The basics: like Tom Kha Kai was not even in the top 3 bowls of Tom Kha I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food very good and inexpensive, large menu selection, only negative is location, not a safe neighborhood. Hard to get reservations, always busy"}
{"text":"This place rivals some the best joints in LA's Thai Town, but it's a bit overpriced. For the cliffs notes on what to order please see below, and I promise you'll leave  with a full belly and a smile on your face. Also it's ok if you unbutton your pants midway through your meal bro.

The Garlic Prawns 
The Khao Soi Short Ribs 
The Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice) 
The Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip)

APPROVED!!!"}
{"text":"My first ever Thai food experience and it was amazing. My friends ordered for me so I can't say what we had (several dishes), but I can say every dish was delicious. While the place is off the strip and not the least bit flashy, it is well worth the Lyft to get there!"}
{"text":"Does Lotus of Siam need another five star review? Probably not. It speaks volumes that tourists seek out this restaurant located in a seedy, hole-in-the-wall commercial district in droves. It's that good."}
{"text":"We wanted to come here because whenever we asked local people they said this place is must. When we arrived on after lunch time there were still line ahead of us and waited 30 minutes. It was huge restaurant with full of people and we tried famous dish from yelp review and very disappointed. Either too salty and too fried. Every dish has same sauce. We orderd 6 dishes and everything was same. Meh. 
Simply Not Good."}
{"text":"My definition of ZE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas! I love love love their fried garlic prawns! It's a must have item on your order! We tried the crispy duck curry, sea bass with onion & ginger, soft-shell crab drunken noodle, pad see yew, tom yum goong seafood soup. They were all very delicious! For dessert, we tried the fried banana with coconut ice cream. The sticky rice & mango was out of season so we couldn't have it thus time. The experience was great, we love their food and service. Definitely will come back every time we're in town."}
{"text":"We came here for this place several times and everytime it is fully committed. But hey don't give up that's why we are here now! When I arrived, I asked for a party of 2, and the wait time is 30-40 min, it was barely 5:30! You can tell how busy it is so I will say if you have somehting planned later that night, make sure you have enough time as they do not take reservation. 

25 min later we got seated at a small table by the wall. The server came right away and asked for our drinks. They appeared to be nice and friendly. The place is a bit noisy because of how busy they are but that's how most Asian restaurants here, and I actually think it is more authentic that way.

After looking at the menu, we ordered Beef Skewer (No.6 on Appetizer) It was amazing! The sauce that came with it is creamy and yummy! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered pork pad thai which is amazing as well. But for my yellow pork curry, I am not too impressed. I think personally I am used to Indian curry which is thick and creamy , so when I tried Thai curry , it is too watery for me. The veggie inside is not too cooked in my opinon, and I ordered a 7 out of a 10 spicy scale  which is way too spicy than any other 7 at other Thai places.

After all, I still think of it as a good Thai food option, but I kind of think it is over rating on yelp, especially after a 30min wait. I still prefer Le Thai on Fremont Street better. 
But I will return and try some other items on the menu if chances come."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and quality. You can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. 
Crispy Duck with Panang is arguably one of the best dishes I've had. Just so satisfying. The textures and flavor are amazing. For typical diners, stick with mild spicy. Don't kill your taste buds :)"}
{"text":"I am so happy my favorite Thai restaurant is open in this spot. The crispy duck was amazingly good. Thank you for opening in this new location!!!!"}
{"text":"It's very good Thai cuisine.  Why 3 stars?  Maybe I fell a bit let down after all the build up and rave reviews every where.

It is a bit on the pricy side, but that's really not an issue.  The menu is extensive.  The dishes are very good and well executed.  The ambience is a bit on the down side.  The strip mall is a bit off putting, but not really an issue.  Service is fair.

Bootom line is that it's very good, but not that much better than a lot of Thai restaurants I've been to.  With all the great chefs and restaurants in Las Vegas, I doubt I'll \"use\" one of my meals here when visiting.  But if I lived in Las Vegas, I would probably be a regular.,"}
{"text":"This has been on my list of to do's for years.  It was almost mythical at this point and to finally be in Vegas and make it over well... Had to happen.  I grabbed my bestie, we hailed a cab and off we went.  

Who knew a run down looking Strip mall would hold one of the best Thai places in the country?  

Huge menu is the only downfall as there was only 2 of us.  We Ordered what the waiter told us to and it was perfect,  the duck parang curry is perfect.  Perfectly crispy, flavors are balanced and you can taste the love put in this.  

This place needs to happen if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. I've been here 3 times now and have had 3 terrific meals. They have an extensive menu of things I've heard of and things I haven't and I've tried both.
5 stars for the Tom Kah Kai soup, any of the fish and duck entrees (which are a bit more expensive at $30), the flat noodles which come with many of these entrees, pork pad sw ew
The jackfruit was ok and the sausage is really weird, just not used to the flavors. 
I love that I can get an amazing meal for 2 with a good bottle of wine for $100."}
{"text":"Get lucky and wait 40+ min. or befriend a Local with the right connections if you want to be fed. 

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry."}
{"text":"Still love this place. First, the service here is extraordinary. Tonight I had the sea bass on drunken noodles, and it was amazing. Satay skewers as an appetizer, which was great with the peanut sauce and picked vegetables. Prices are going up, but I guess that's to be expected when you're the best Thai place in town."}
{"text":"The reason behind why I gave them only one star. 2 things are taste of foods and price. Im so disappointed on portion and the price. Curry shrimp for 6 pieces cost me $27. My idiot friend ordered without checking the price. The portions are super small, I just cant believe it really?? $27. The services are okay."}
{"text":"The restaurant front looked less than impressive, and I was slightly turned off by the ghetto strip mall vibe, but took a chance because a friend said I would love it. 
Oh boy, did I!! Be ready to wait up to an hour during regular dining time (6:30-8:30), but don't worry, once the food gets in your mouth you'll totally understand why so many covet this place. This is probably the best thai food I have ever had! It is no wonder why they have so many Zagat awards!The decor is whatever, but honestly I would eat in a card board box as long as they would serve me. 
We ordered the crispy duck panang, the seafood drunken noodle and the thai barbeque chicken. Delicious! Everything was amazingly prepared and I got so excited I had to be stopped from ordering more to go. I can't even say what I loved the  most! I will definitely come back to try more! It will be my new Mecca of every trip I take to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in town. Everything I've had here has been spot on. Portion sizes are good, food quality is good, the food is delicious and service is good considering how busy they usually are. Prices are reasonable given the quality of what you are getting here. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, honestly... this place is just not good. Thai tea is way overpriced and it's MOSTLY sugar. The chicken satay is very good and flavorful. The chicken pad thai is good, very flavorful for pad Thai that isn't spicy. The pad kee mao, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Don't even think about it just move on and close your eyes... I just don't understand how you manage to mess up this dish THAT BAD. The panang curry taste like water lol. My panang curry came out cold... and just was not flavorful. I am a Thai food addict, I live for thai food. I work at a Thai restaurant. I would not come back here no matter what, the Krung thai is better than this place and less overpriced. I'm only giving 2 stars because service is EXCELLENT. Very attentive. Thai tea comes in a tiny glass jar and it's mostly half&shall. Also, portions are tiny. A baby can eat the entree portion by themselves. I would say to try it and probably not come back. I really wanted to love this place but I can't even say that the food is mediocre...it's just bad. Every single dish that came out was not freshly made. You can very clearly tell they keep it in a container and reheat it when it's ordered...and they don't even heat enough that it's hot"}
{"text":"I don't care about any of the restaurants on the strip except for nobu and hakassan of course. This is where you need to eat when you are in Vegas. It's off the beaten path a little bit which to me is a plus but the place is always packed and I guarantee you will wait for a table. But guess what. It's worth it. While you wait you can go next door for a foot massage and a cocktail to get you primed for one of the best Thai meals you will have in your life. No frills and the staff is blunt and straight forward because they pump massive amounts of food out of this place everyday. Must must must have the Thai beef salad. Again. Get the Thai beef salad

Also the salt and pepper shrimp that is peel and eat. Unless you eat the shells which I do. As well as any greens sautéed up in their famous garlic sauce. 

Get in the cab and go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, especially at night time. Yelp avg is four stars so Kuong thought it'd be a nice try. Yelp didn't let us down:) We were there for dinner, service wasn't bad. Food tasted great. Panang Chicken, Tom Yum Kai, Beef Larb, and Issan style beef jerk were great. Can't wait to try out other items the next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I love red curry! My husband had pad sew with garlic chicken wings.  Mom was scared to try anything so she stuck to fried rice but end up eating hubbies food.  We came in for lunch a few minutes before kitchen closed.  But we will definitely be back.  Nice atmosphere, decor and a book as their wine list lol."}
{"text":"Make a reservation, you will be so happy you did.  This very special Las Vegas treasure is the best.  Only sorry we could not try everything.  Thai beef salad, short ribs served with egg noodle and curry sauce, soft crab drunken noodle and steak tartar. Ask your friendly wait staff for their favorites you will not be disappointed.  Our very special find was a raw shrimp with a small slice of garlic, tamarind paste, a lime oil spice sauce and all wrapped in a mint leaf."}
{"text":"Went there on a friend's recommendation. The place is in a small shopping mall next to a \"men bathhouse\" not the best place in town outside of the strip. We went there at 5:30 pm and people were already lining up. It has a great wine selection, although  I believe it's hard to have wine with Asian food. The service was fast and everyone was attentive to our needs. The food was delicious, the Thai green curry was well prepared not too spicy not too blend. It's worth it's rating and recommendation."}
{"text":"The Lotus is going into my Vegas rotation from here on out. Despite visiting LV multiple times a year, I had never tried this well known Thai establishment. I was very impressed with the food and service. Based on Anthony Bourdain's recommendations on his TV show, I skipped right past the first dozen pages or so and went directly to the \"Northern Specialty\" pages. My party ordered the Khoa Soi, Red Chili Dip, and the Northern Larb. The waiter asked us how spicy we preferred on a scale of 1-10. Now I pride myself on enjoying very spicy food, but the #7 level of spicy really made me sweat. My table also ordered a sticky rice for every person at the table. DEFINITELY GET THE STICKY RICE. I wish I'd saved more room that day and ordered more at LoS, because the food was fantastic. In fact, I may need to push up my next trip to LV in order to get back to LoS ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great food, 
We ordered garlic prawn, panang and red curry dishes.
Very satisfied with the quality of the food.

But the service was horrible.  We tried to ignore the unfriendliness off the staff."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is worth the drive from the strip! This place is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas, IMO. Even Anthony Bourdain made a pit stop here.

I can imagine the wait being long during peak hours. Luckily, I dined here after the Sunday lunch rush and was immediately seated. Even so, the restaurant was packed and there were only a couple of empty tables. 

I ordered the garlic prawns, one of their most popular dishes. The prawns were fried to perfection! The shells were crispy like potato chips. Definitely a memorable dish."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai I have eaten outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Amazing and so worth the $20 cab ride from the Strip. We got the tip to try this place out from one of my husband's business-traveling friends. Consultants tend to really know their restaurants, so we knew we had to check it out. 

The wine menu in this place is stunning! I had an Auslese riesling that was sweet and delectable.

The larb salad, fried tofu, and yellow curry were all fantastic and some of the best I have ever had, and I have eaten those at many, many places over the course of the last 2 decades. Cashew chicken was pretty great too. 

The only thing that was just okay was the tom yum soup - definitely decent, but not the best ever. They got the sour part right, but I like mine super fragrant with lots of lemongrass and cilantro, which this did not have. 

I only wish we'd had room for dessert - we both felt very sad that we didn't have any space left to try it (if you check out what all we ordered above, you can see why, haha)!

Overall, we LOVED it, and Lotus of Siam is going to become a pilgrimage every time we hit up Vegas."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to this foodie destination and I walked away a happy camper. It's so hard to choose just a few dishes because everything sounds great, so either come with a large group of people or get ready to come back. We had the crispy duck curry (the one with the alcohol, lol) and it was delicious. Super creamy but the crispiness is still there. We also tried the pad thai, which was good but I'd stick with a more unique dish next time. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Well let me tell you... This place is up to par for dam sure !!!but I still think krung Siam is a bit better for cheaper ...but not saying I'd never come back the food is pretty good ;)"}
{"text":"We came over at 9pm after a long drive from Monterey, CA. 

Our waitress was the most pushover, busiest, non caring waitress I have ever encountered. She was able to take care of the other tables besides ours.

Bad waitressing does not compensate for the food.

Never coming back to this thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is hands down the best thai restaurant in Las Vegas. This is the go to restaurant when I have friends visiting. The tofu rad na and fried snapper is my favorite. I highly recommend making reservations in advance because if not you're looking at a 30/45 minute wait."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great.  I plan on making this a regular stop.

I'm surprised by a lot of the lower ratings for this place.  Well not totally surprised.  Of course there's going to be some backlash from all the publicity they're receiving.

But if you go to Lotus of Siam, and you look at the menu and say, \"Hmmm, I just want to eat pad thai, tom yum koong, papaya salad, and a bunch of other crap I can get at every Thai restaurant in the world,\" I really don't care about your opinion.  And if you gave this place 1 star for your review of their buffet, maybe you just delete your yelp account."}
{"text":"if you come here for lunch, do NOT eat from the buffet.  

they are super slow at re-stocking the foods (even the white rice!  come on!  it's RICE.  this is a THAI RESTAURANT), and all the diners are watching the buffet tables like vultures ---- as soon as someone comes out with one of those large metal bowls of fresh food, they are there, plates in hand, saliva dripping down their chins.....

the food -- when there's actually anything there for you -- is a mix of delicious thai food and standard chinese-y buffet food.  Lo mein-like noodle stir fry, spring rolls, fried rice alongside ground chicken cooked with chili and other delicious flavors, some sort of veggie curry, fresh ginger tofu curry.  

CONCLUSION: Food was delicious.  Service was poor.  Thai ice tea had too much milk.  ORDER OFF THE MENU.  Avoid the buffet at all costs (though it is only $8.99.........)"}
{"text":"This rating is actually a 3 1/2 stars but only because we only had the lunch buffet.  From most of the reviews it sounds like the menu is the way to go.  Don't get me wrong, the buffet was fine.  It had a decent mix of things, but because of the chow mien, fried rice and egg rolls, and a few other dishes, it felt like any of the other good chinese buffets I've been to.  There was a curry dish or two that I have never tried before but I think I missed out not ordering off of the menu.  

If the popularity of this place is doubted, just show up at 11:20 to see the people waiting out front for it to open.  It's located in a weird strip mall location.  You can't tell from the road that it is actually more of a business complex than a strip mall.  There is a huge parking lot area surrounded on three sides by buildings.

As for price, it about $19 for two without drinks."}
{"text":"O...m.....g. This place is so bomb. Don't even eat the pad thai or other entrees. The Shrimp and Duck is what you should come here for. It is so addicting and amazing. I take the challenge to find something similar to this flavorful Shrimp in Orange county. There has to be one !!!"}
{"text":"Feels like the bloom is off of this rose....

Had been coming to LOS for at least the past 8 years annually but this trip has made our group decide to drop them from the rotation

Portion size is lower while prices have risen

Feels that short cuts have been taken in preparations as flavors are not as nuanced as the past

Service felt rushed on an 8 pm reservation for a Sunday evening

Ultimately, LOS felt like a tourist destination/trap from the Strip 

We are looking at Le Thai and perhaps Chada Thai as alternatives for next time our tastes of Thailand hit us in the desert"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Stick to the northern menu. The karb is spicy but very flavorful. Duck khao soi was delicious and slightly sweet. Went on a Wednesday for lunch and it was not too busy. Make sure you dodge the plant when you walk through the front door. It will get you"}
{"text":"Where to start.... Man this place was amazing. Totally made me realize Thai food is one of my favorites! The crispy duck with any of their curries was amazing, as well as the soft shell crab.

Their Thai tea and Thai coffee are on a whole nother level too...level epic!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype!

I have to say I am super impressed with the dishes they have. 

We came here on our last day in Vegas before traveling to seattle and ordered the crab fried rice, tom kah kai soup, beef satay, and garlic shrimp. 

Beef satay: I've never had thai styled beef on skewers before but this was an epic way to start! the peanut sauce is just divine. 

Crab Fried Rice: Literally the best crab fried rice i've had in my life. There's way more chunks of crab vs. other chinese places where I've ordered the same dish. 

Tom Kah Kai: This didn't stick out to me much but it did still taste as great as any other thai place. 

Garlic Shrimp: My favorite thai restaurant makes this very differently, but Lotus of Siam's version is pretty bomb as well! This one's deep fried and not smothered in minced garlic and you can eat the shell as well!

I would come back next time I'm in Vegas. So many other dishes to try!! :)"}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was friendly, but the overall service was extremely poor.  The hostess station was a complete mess with 5-6 people tripping over each other, answering phones and looking at computer screens with people being seated very slowly.  A hostess assigned us a table which no one took us to and three minutes later she looked back up and said, \"have you been helped yet!\"  Once seated we tried to order wine and were told that they did not have a liquor license but saw beer and champagne on other tables.  Our appetizers came out quickly and were very tasty, but it was close to another hour before we saw our entree (the waitstaff was attentive and apologetic though).  Again, good food and nice workers but very slow and disorganized."}
{"text":"Was driving through Las Vegas and have been wanting to go here for years and had to make the small detour. It did not disappoint. 

I kept it simple with the soft shell crab over drunken noodles and it was pretty fantastic. The crab was cooked perfectly and the flavor on the noodles and accompanying vegetables was great with a perfect spice level to my liking. Can't remember exactly what my wife got but I do recall constantly reaching over to take more.

Really the only reason I want to drive to California again is to stop here. Also the food came out incredibly fast."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been here and I liked it! I tried the dumplings which was actually pretty good! I also had the tum yum noodles with no spice (I don't like spicy food) and I was extremely satisfied! I'm full but not too stuffed. It is kinda weird, it being in a sketchy strip mall, but that's the charm!"}
{"text":"2nd time visiting LOS while in Vegas and I noticed the location of the restaurant changed. The change certainly didn't affect the quality, taste, and presentation of the food as I remembered back in December 2017 on my first visit. Decided to almost duplicate the order I had during my first experience since everything was so, so good! I don't recall the exact names of the dishes but they were Tom Ca Gai soup (not pictured), jumbo garlic prawns, crispy duck, drunken noodles, shrimp fried rice (ordered for the first time) and mango sticky rice for dessert. The pics speak for themselves.. DE-LISH!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 12/25/13. Got there a half hour before they opened. The mall they are in is pretty run down, but there is plenty of free parking. Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from eating here. The restaurant inside is much bigger and better than the outside would suggest. We were going to leave, but a line quickly formed before they opened so we figured we should stay. This is the best Thai food I have eaten in the US. Service was excellent, food came out quickly, and best of all, the food was excellent. They also have a huge wine selection if you drink wine. Ate the Drunken Noodles with soft shell crab, Massaman curry, crab fried rice, Tom Yum soup. The curry was sweeter than I've had before but was quite good. Highly recommended. Honestly, not sure what the difference would be between a 4 and a 5 star rating. I can't imagine a Thai restaurant being better than this. Maybe I should give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place is legit. A lot of the time these super-hyped places are just that, hype. Commercial Center, where this is located does not convey how nice and clean it is on the inside. 

Panang chicken and shrimp was very good. The shrimp, unlike a lot of places were big and tender. 

They do have a lunch buffet with a decent offering, and I don't know if they change it up daily or not, but it didn't tickle my fancy.   Our group of ~16 was almost evenly divided. 

There are two major cons to this place. 

1) I like spicy food and usually order a 7/10 wherever I go.  In this instance I went with a sizeable group of people, all who like it spicy. In this instance 7 was way spicy. More like a 10 or 11 and I wasn't the only one with this assessment. 


2) While the food was very good, $11.95 for the lunch portion just seemed too high. 

I'm only giving this a four star rating due to the price. If it was a little more in line with lunch entree pricing, it would have been a five."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch at 11:40 on a Friday and were lucky as we were seated right away.  However, the restaurant quickly filled up so try to get here shortly after they open or you may be waiting for a table.  We had the spicy squid salad and the squid was very tender and the salad was nice and tangy and fresh.  They put fresh green Thai chilis in it so it is a very, very spicy dish.  My mouth was on fire, but I love spice so it was still a good dish.  I had to drink an entire Thai ice tea to bring down the heat.  We then moved on to the crispy rice with pork.  That was our least favorite dish.  I wouldn't order that again.  My husband ordered the beef massaman curry for his main entree.  It was ok; we ordered a 7 heat level, but after the spicy squid, this curry seemed mild in comparison.  I ordered the crispy duck khao soi and it was delicious, but extremely rich.  It was almost like noodles in a bisque like sauce.  Overall, this was a good meal and I'm glad we tried it.  It's nothing I would crave again for our next trip to Vegas as I've had Thai food back home that is just as good."}
{"text":"On our recent visit to Vegas, we trekked out to the famous Lotus of Siam.  Taxi drivers know about this place, there are photos of celebrities all over their walls, and reservations are highly recommended.  When we arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was empty... but it got packed after 7pm.  Here is what we ordered (on a scale of 1-10 on spice, we got 2, and it was plenty spicy):

1) Nam Prik Ong - featured on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\".  Very interesting... it's like a chili dip accompanied by a bunch of things you can dip with.  I can't say I loved it, but it was definitely unique.  Wouldn't get it again but definitely worth trying out.
2) Pad Thai - very good but the noodles are skinnier than your traditional pad thai.
3) Drunken Noodles - SO Yummy!  
4) Papaya Salad - very good!
5) Fried Garlic Prawns - my favorite dish.  I loved how they took the shrimp OUT of its shell before they battered & fried it.  It was seasoned & cooked perfectly.
6) Chicken Satay - just like any other Thai restaurant
7) Yellow Curry with Chicken - the chicken was good cuts of breast meat & potato was cooked perfectly.  

Some people say that this is the best Thai restaurant in America.  I don't know if I'd go that far... but then again, I can't name a Thai restaurant that I think is better.  What I love about Lotus of Siam is that they offer all your traditional Thai dishes that you are used to ordering and then they have some really unique dishes that you can't find in other Thai restaurants.  Is it worth the hype?  YES."}
{"text":"great food and service. the area might seem sketchy but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is arguably the best Thai food I have ever had.  The flavors are robust and layered.  You may order hot dishes, but not all dishes are spicy hot (although you may order them that way.)

The waitstaff was attentive, helpful, smiling, efficient and knowledgeable.  The restaurant is not fancy, but clean. A great meal!

We ordered: 
19. TOM YUM KUNG-Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass & straw mushroom.
36. YUM NUAH or YUM KAI (Thai Beef or chicken Salad)-Your choice of charbroiled steak-slice or charbroiled chicken, onion, tomato, fresh chili mixed with lime juice, served on bed of green.  
K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) -- 9.95 Influenced by Burmese this almost sweet pork curry is one of the most popular curries of the north (it is somewhat similar to pork stew) Cooked with pork, pork with fat, dried and fresh spices. It is usually eaten with rolled up *sticky rice ball.

The soup was fresh, rich, flavorful with great depth.  Very satisfying!

The beef salad was delicious!  The sauce on the beef was sweet and tangy and the meat was grilled to perfection. 

The pork stew was so tender!  The pork was slow-cooked in a red sauce that was savory with a bit of sweetness. This dish was not spicy, but flavorful and hearty.

Loved it and cannot wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is hyped up.  Yes, it's busy, make reservations. Yes, service was good and fast. Yes, the food was good but pricey with small portions.  Le Thai on Freemont Street, with it's small menu, is by far better that Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Just wish the prices were a bit lower! 

For the alkies out there, Lotus has an amazing wine selection."}
{"text":"the best thai food in las vegas!   you would never guess that the best thai food in vegas is in some nondescript crappy strip mall a few miles off the strip but it is.  be prepared to wait...I dont know that they do reservations but its worth it.  the food is excellent and is quite reasonable especially when you compare it to comparable quality restaurants in the major casinos!"}
{"text":"A lot of times Thai noodle dishes feel heavy to me.  The noodle dishes we had here were surprisingly light and just as flavorable.  We had 3 dishes for 4 people, under 45$ after tip/tax for dinner seemed like a great deal!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely lives up to the hype! We ordered a bunch of things family style an shared- highly recommend the Mussaman Curry and pad see ew!"}
{"text":"Came to LV for a trade show and wanted to dine near our hotel on Karen/Paradise.  Saw this place with great reviews & walking distance and decided to give it a try.  The walk was a little scary through a sketchy neighborhood - but well worth it!  I've never heard of Drunken Noodles before and my wife and I don't eat much Thai food, but these were awesome! Our waiter also recommended the charbroiled prawns, & pork satay.    We ordered a little too spicy at #8, but ate it up!  Excellent service as well.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and there was an hour wait!  I should have made reservations!  I don't think I've ever waited an hour for Thai food.  Was it worth it?  Every minute!

We started off with the En Tuan soup.  En Tuan means slow cooked.  You have to like tendon to be able to enjoy this one.  Generous slices of slow cooked beef and tendon in a flavorful basil, hot and sour broth.  Oh so good!  Luckily, I checked other Yelp reviews, so I knew to order medium spicy.  Even at medium, it was really spicy, just the perfect amount for me.  I like it spicy where you have to take a sip of your drink every other bite, but not so spicy where your lips and tongue are on fire!  

I'm not a huge fan of panang curry.  I usually prefer regular yellow curry.  But after reading other Yelper's reviews that this is the best dish, I had to try the Crispy duck on panang.  This dish was alright in my opinion.  The crispy duck skin was delicious but the duck itself was a little on the dry side.  Plus, there was hardly any meat, mostly skin.  

We also ordered the Garlic Prawns.  My picture posted, doesn't do this dish justice.  Huge prawns with the shell still attached but slighty pulled back and deep fried.  The prawn shells were so light and crispy, I must find out how they do it!  Overall, this dish tastes very similar to Salt & Pepper shrimp at a Chinese restaurant.  

Lastly, we had Pad Thai.  Boring, I know.  It was different in the fact that they used thin clear noodles instead of the wide linguine type noodles and it wasn't saucy.  Not much to write about here. 

I've come to the conclusion that I have to come back with a bigger group of people and try more on their menu.  There are a lot of dishes towards the back of the menu with Northern Thai cuisine that I've yet to experience."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and sick of the Strip's fare, or not liking what seems like a lack of value in what they are able to offer, try the Thai food at Lotus of Siam. It's some of the best casual food you'll find in the area. 

The location is a short cab ride from the LV Strip in a older little Asian strip mall- don't expect much on that end. On the other hand, the food is great, the prices are good, and the wait isn't too long if you pick a good time to get there."}
{"text":"This is an upscale Thai place with an extensive wine menu. Make sure you try the northern specialty dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Thai places in my life but none have compared to the flavor & authenticity of this one.  I went with a group of friends & one of them grew up & Thailand, so she suggested we go here on our visit to Vegas.  I noticed this place was popular before I even stepped into the door, because we saw a bunch of taxis outside.  This meant people have heard of this place who were visiting on the strip, etc.  Overall amazing food, great selection, & friendly attentive staff.  I will defiantly be coming back again on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just had some lunch here after reading the reviews. A solid 3-star thai place for me. The best part was the very affordable pricing, I had a Thai Iced Coffee, and appetizer, and main soup for $25. 

The iced coffee was delicious as it always is, the appetizer was the crispy rice with sour pork cubes. This was eh. Just deep fried rice and the \"pork cubes\" are really just cut up ham that you could get down the street at the super market. 

I had the Northern style (no coconut milk) Tom Kum Kai (chicken soup) but I subbed the chicken for prawns. This was good, not amazing, not really good, just...good. 

I'd go again, but if you're into Thai food, don't expect anything as amazing as the other reviews would have you believe."}
{"text":"This new location is beautiful! What an upgrade!! 

I highly recommend visiting if you're in Vegas. Honestly, I have yet to try the Northern Thai dishes. I know this is what they're known for, but after reading the descriptions, I was not feeling any of them. 

This 5-star review is for their garlic prawns. For $40, you get a few thick pieces of prawns, and they are SO good. The best part is the skin that is all fried up with that garlic. YUM!!! 

I've also tried their soups, and it's pretty good. The seafood soup is filled with tons of seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari, and scallops). The last time I was here, I also tried the pad see ew, and it was not as good as I was expecting. I've had better in So Cal. 

There is a waiting area and bar now at the new location. There is also a special frame to honor Anthony Bourdain too."}
{"text":"An absolutely great restaurant. I have eaten here for years and it has always been a Vegas classic! The service and food are always excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in search of fine Asian dining!"}
{"text":"I've been dreaming of trying out this place since I saw it featured on Top Chef a few years ago. I was so excited to finally try this place out on my most recent trip to Vegas. 

My husband and I came by on a Tuesday afternoon around 11:30am. There was no wait, but the restaurant was pretty busy! We got seated right away. 

Seafood soup - Soup was tangy and perfect for the chilly day. It was came with tons of seafood! 

Pad See Ew with chicken - This is a standard Thai dish that we decided to order, and it was not that great! It was bland and the noodles were cooked too long. I've definitely had better at local Thai places in SoCal. 

Garlic Prawns - Couldn't leave this place without trying this. It's pretty pricey, but was worth the $$ for me! It comes with about 7 pieces of prawns. It was interesting because the shells were deep fried in the garlic mix, and they were so good! This was definitely a hit for me! 

Banana egg roll with coconut ice cream - This is a pretty large dessert for two, but we ended up finishing more than half. The egg roll was filled with bananas and deep fried. The coconut ice cream is the perfect match with the egg rolls. Would highly recommend! 

Next time, I'll be more bold and try the more authentic Northern Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"Good service,new location no liquor license yet. Jad the chefs specials because if you go off of those its normal Thai."}
{"text":"2 days shy of 4 months ago I last stepped foot into Lotus of Siam. My experience today was not much better than the one I wrote about then. I ended up paying $14 for a \"buffet\" , cough, cough, that was absolutely pathetic. The Tom Kha soup was ok but nothing special. 6 or 7 egg rolls would be brought out then vanish leaving an empty tray. The garlic wings looked like something left too long under the heat lamps, and then I had the Chili Mint Chicken with excessive squash or whatever the heck it was. I never thought a Thai place could massacre a dish such as Chili Mint Chicken but LOS has found a way to do it. To call this a \"buffet\" is doing the word a great disservice. I'm not expecting a spread the size of the Bacchanal buffet, but this...this is freakin ridiculous with what they're trying to pass off as a lunch buffet. 

Seriously for the price and especially on quality and taste Komol across the parking lot kicks LOS's derriere. If you think this is the best Thai food found in Vegas, you seriously need to pull out your Yelp app on your phone and do a little exploring. Coming here for a good lunch is the equivalent of a sucker's bet....pay out the nose, and get less in return. 

I can't give them anything more than 1 Star. My conscience is screaming at me for even giving them that, but fortunately Yelp says I have to give them something so that quiets my conscience a little. Now to find some Pepto to quiet my grumbling and very unhappy stomach..... 

By the way after rereading my old review...I stand by it. Still valid. And the one before that. Still valid. Notice the 1 Star pattern? Don't say I didn't try and warn ya. 

Tip: The closest place to buy Pepto is CVS which is at 2735 South Maryland Parkway, if you know the back way out of the parking lot you can get your relief in under 10 min from the turn of the car key to the swipe of your debit card. Trust me...someone will value this tip soon enough."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Great flavor. Their medium spicy was indeed medium. Recommend the green curry :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had.   Everything is prepared home made.  This is truly an amazing place for flavor sensations...   I also highly recommend the whole lobster.."}
{"text":"The best thai food EVER. 

A friend introduced us this place last time we visited Las Vegas. We came back here again because the food was just on point!

This time, I got the famous garlic shrimp, pineapple fried rice, shrimp panang curry and papaya salad. 
Garlic shrimp was crispy, well seasoned and super tasty! I could kill the whole plate myself! 

You do have to make a reservation or go early when they open. They open for dinner at 5:30pm and we got to the restaurant around 5:15pm. There was already a long line ahead of us. 

Definitely a place to visit when you are tired of that crazy strip scene!"}
{"text":"I still remember when this restaurant was called \"EPoys Restaurant\" and this Thai restaurant has much better and healthier food. I'll be coming back next time I'm on this side of town for sure. I recommend this restaurant to anybody that wants Thai food."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai Places out there, there are only 3 steps you need to follow.

Step 1. Order Garlic Prawns
Step 2. Order Roast Duck Curry
Step 3. Eat and Repeat.

Everything else is also really incredible, but the Garlic Prawn and Roast Duck Curry are just so spectacular."}
{"text":"The food is great and full of bursting flavor. This is the best Thai food I ever had in Las Vegas. Make sure to make a reservation, this is a popular destination ."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It was hard to find, but all the best places are hidden gems am I right? Food was so good, I can't wait to come back! And our server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We secured online reservations at Lotus, often sited as the best Thai restaurant in the country, well in advance.  The original location suffered extensive water damage and has not reopened to date, but the owners are now operating out of the old Roy's location.  It had been just over 15 years since we last dined at Lotus so we decided to try our favorite appetizer, nam kao tod, a crispy rice salad with diced sour sausage. It was very good, but the amount of sausage has decreased over time.

For entrees we chose seafood drunken noodles and curry catfish with both being a disappointment.  The seafood in the drunken noodles included the inferior green lip mussels and imitation crab.  The problem with the catfish was several of the small pieces were overcooked.  The actual facility is very nice and service was prompt though at times rushed in an apparent attempt to turnover tables as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Loved going here! As a non resident, it was great to find a local place in such an odd old strip mall like location. The \"strip mall\" is now kind of a foodie haven with various cool restaurants dotted throughout the U-shaped building structure. Once inside Lotus of Siam is a homey packed space with two dining rooms, quick service and authentic Thai. We ordered as a group and ate family style so it's hard to recollect all the dishes I had, but I had no complaints, except it seemed a bit pricey for thai."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch buffet and dinner.  Lunch buffet was a bargain but didn't have too much variety.  The curry chicken was tasty.  Dinner was a bit of a letdown considering how high our expectations were.  The common thread to the dishes we had was that they were super thai spicy even though we asked for medium.  When we were in thailand, some food was spicy but theirs was certainly way more.  Water and rice couldn't help.  I wonder if that's their trick.  To get your taste buds so numb that you can't taste anything.  Overall, it was good but not as good as Sripraphai in NYC.  Sripraphai may have less heat but is full on flavor."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for about a year after hearing about it from a dear friend. I travel through Las Vegas frequently but it never worked out till now. I was so glad I read the yelp reviews for menu ideas first. We ordered the Garlic Prawns. I asked and was told there are 7 prawns with the order. They were extremely tasty and I didn't count them. The papaya salad was spicy hot and full of flavor. The beef Pad Thai was medium spicy and delicious. I called ahead to make a reservation but they didn't accept them and we had no problem getting a table on a Thursday night. The service was outstanding with a very short wait for service"}
{"text":"This Thai food was good, but not the best Thai food in America as the press on the wall would have you believe. The nam kao tod was really excellent, combining sweet sour and spicy. Everything else was decent for Thai food. The spice level was pretty high, but they at least have decent size water glasses."}
{"text":"This gem of a place is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in America. I went here (several times) with a southeast asian, he knows his food."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the country! Be sure to check out the selections on the Northern Thai section of the menu. This has many dishes that you just don't see on other Thai menus. Be careful of the spicy/hot ratings. I love spicy food, but the 2 or 3 star out of 10 is plenty spicy for me. This would be equivalent of medium to hot at many other Thai restaurants. Don't let the neighborhood of this place fool you, it is nice inside and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Chef Jet Tila and Anthony Bourdain: \"Don't order Pad Thai. Go to the back of the menu and order Northern Thai specialties.\" 



 Thai food, more specifically, delicious, authentic Thai food is almost impossible to find. Being a traveler, I've been seeking something that would be comparable to what I've tasted when I was in Thailand. For me and my friends, we had to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to experience what I believe is to be the best Thai food outside of Thailand...and it's only an hour flight away from LAX. 

 Saipin Chutima is a James Beard Award recipient offering traditional, authentic Northern Thai recipes that were passed down from generation to generation. It is a step away from the sweet and tangy flavors that so many of us have been exposed to and are familiar with. 

A line congregates outside of the restaurant before opening its doors for service. The menu sits like a book, with numerous dishes to choose from. The décor is simple, casual and a little outdated (but who honestly cares when you're here for the food). Photos of famous people who have visited the restaurant line the walls. And the food...well, it's simply superb. 
 
MY FAVORITE DISH. EN TUAN (HOT POT: $13.95): Spicy and sour soup with beef tendon, bean sprouts and beef slices. I seriously dream about this soup day in and day out after I had my first taste. The broth was full of flavor....bold, luxurious with a lot of depth. Hints of garlic can be tasted in the soup that was seasoned well. The tendon was perfectly cooked with the best texture that ever was put forth in soup. I could slurp this forever and never get sick of it! Thank goodness we got a bowl. It was more than enough for a group of four and the fire in the middle definitely kept the soup hot. We asked for a spice level of 5 and could not taste any spiciness unfortunately (maybe we just have a high tolerance).  

 
LARB WITH PORK ($10.95): Ground pork, chopped onion, green chili, and lime juice served with fresh cabbage. The salad was fresh, with a nice balance of acidity and refreshing. Slightly spicy and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed it but the next time I'm there, I wanna try the Northern larb salad.  

DRUNKEN NOODLE SOFT SHELL CRAB ($22.95): Deep fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil served on top of pan fried flat rice noodle. I loved this dish. The crab was extremely crispy and retained its crispiness throughout the remainder of the meal (although it wasn't long since we scarfed everything down pretty quickly). The noodles were nicely cooked and was a bit spicy. They didn't ask our spice level and I assumed they kept it at a 5, which was the perfect spice for a good kick.  

 
CRISPY DUCK WITH PANANG ($24.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognag. This was absolutely delicious. The duck was extremely crispy. The panang curry was rich and spicy. It was slightly sweet, yet savory and full of flavor. This was definitely one of my favorite dishes and a must order.  

THUM KA NOON- POUNDED AND SHREDDED YOUNG JACK FRUIT ($10.95): This local dish from the north is unique to the northern part of North Thailand. Made of shredded young jack fruit, ground pork, tomatoes, northern Thai spices and seasoning. This was seriously my second favorite dish. I loved everything about it. It was sweet, a little tangy and a bit sour and spicy. The texture was similar to shredded meat. As full as I was, I couldn't stop eating this dish.  

 
MANGO WITH SWEET STICKY RICE- SEASONAL ($8.95): Sweet, delicious, good. The mangoes were ripe and the rice was perfect. Enough said.  

Overall, you can't go wrong when ordering at Lotus of Siam. Chutima managed to bring dishes that you normally wouldn't find at your local Thai restaurant. It's a special place when literally everything you order tasted phenomenal. I had a difficult time deciding my favorite dish amongst the amazing dishes. When you dream about the food and can't get it out of your head, then you know you've found a gem. The next time I visit Lotus of Siam, I need to try the Nam Prik Noom (just sayin'). Word of advice: Book a reservation because lines form before the place even opens."}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas for a hockey tournament and a team mate said this was the best Thai food he has ever had. Never had Thai food before this but I can't wait to eat it again. The food was amazing having tried 4 different orders. We got the Seafood soup, Issan Sausage, Yellow Currey with Chicken, and Combination Fried Rice. All of that was delicious and the Seafood Soup had a great spice to it that I was not expecting at first. Be careful if you aren't used to spicy foods though as what you may called mild and order mild could possibly be too spicy for you which is what I saw happen to a friend. The waitress was nice enough to get him a drink for free to help get rid of the spiciness.

If you plan on going make a reservation 2-3 days before to be safe. We had a group of 15 people and tried to make a reservation the day of which was a bad idea, but luckily we put our name down and gave them our phone number and they called us after about an hour to tell us our table was ready.

If you visit Vegas there is no reason to not go to this place, by far some of the best food I have ever had."}
{"text":"They're much busier during dinner than lunch. We tried coming here a couple times when we had family in town, but weren't able to secure reservations. So, we decided to come during lunch and were able to get a table immediately. It was Friday and still pretty busy, but as long as you don't have to wait, that's great.

My main focus at Lotus is their Northern Thai specialties. Besides these dishes, there are a lot of other Thai specialties that you don't typically find at other Thai restaurants in the valley. 

Nam Kao Tod ($8.95): Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chili, ginger, peanuts and lime juice. Tasty salad mixture with great texture from the crispy rice. Love all the herbs and flavors.

Sai Oua ($11.95): Northern Thai-style spicy pork sausage. Served with ginger, red onion, chilies, and Napa cabbage. One of my all-time favorite sausages. I love the lemongrass especially. The sausage is great with all the fixings, too.

Nam Prik Ong ($11.95): Northern Thai red chili dip composed of ground pork, tomato, and spices; served with assorted vegetables and fried pork rinds. This dip will remind you of a meat sauce (you could totally create a pasta with it). It has a good depth of flavor and it's not heavy.

Thum Ka Noon ($10.95): Pounded and shredded young jackfruit salad with ground pork, tomato, and northern Thai spices and seasoning. Another delicious Northern Thai specialty. I enjoyed the flavors of this salad more than the Nam Kao Tod and Nam Prik Ong. Goes well with rice.

Crispy Duck Panang ($27.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. The duck is juicy and the skin is fantastically crispy. The panang is really great, too and definitely good with any choice of meat, but the crispy duck is the way to go!

Everything is delicious and takes me back to my vacation in Chiang Mai. I'm definitely back for more specialties!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the spicy level if you can't tolerate too much we asked for level 2 and it was very spicy!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This restaurant is located in an unassuming shopping plaza but the inside decor & food is definitely worth the visit if you're ever in the area. The Thai iced coffee was good. We shared a few dishes family-style:

Appetizer: 
- Chicken wings: very good
- Fish cake: flavorful
- Papaya salad: refreshing but the dressing is a bit spicy

Entree: 
- Green Curry: def recommend!
- Stir fried vegetables w/ crispy pork: def recommend!
- Seafood drunken noodles: recommend; lots of flavor
- Pad Thai: ordinary, nothing too special"}
{"text":"The food here was so delicious ! Especially the duck panang curry. We also had yellow chicken curry and the pad Thai all very delicious! Would recommend for anyone in Las Vegas to try out :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in the freaking USA!  I've been all over Thailand several times, and I swear this food is just as delish, except you won't get diarrhea from eating it haha.

I don't even know what to recommend...my mom is super Asian, so we just let her take the reigns and order to her heart's delight, family style.  I know we usually get the hot pot with seafood (not chicken, it's not as good), fried catfish salad, this peppery steak dish that I'm drooling for right now, and stuffed poultry legs of some kind.

If you reeeeaaaallllly want to know what to order, PM me and I'll ask my mom.  No joke.  She is like an Asian food master queen, and I'm that passionate about this restaurant.

This place is definitely a little hole in the wall, is always packed, and the area is more than a little sketchy looking.  There is even a sign that says to not leave valuables in your car.  Be prepared to encounter some homeless American citizens in the parking lot.  But it is so worth it.  Plus you'll forget about your car getting robbed for the hour while you are eating because the food is so good.

Oh and afterwards...go to the massage place to your right when you exit the restaurant.  Way cheaper and just as great as anything you will get on the strip :)"}
{"text":"What a little gem off the strip!! One of the best Thai food I've, even better than most in the Bay Area. It's also where a lot of the celebrities goes.

Here's what we had:
Garlic  shrimp  - omg, it is really really good and a must try. A little expensive $21.95 but so worth it to try. The shrimp is taken out of the shell but they include the shell as part of your dish. They cook the shrimp shell to a perfect crisp, almost like eating a chip. 

Khai Soi - $8.95 - also very good. It's noodles in a curry sauce, almost like a soup 

Tom Kah Kai - $4.95 cup - the best darn soup ever!!! It's very similar to tom yum soup but with coconut milk and a little spicier too. Mouth watering goodness and def. a must order!

Deep Fried Sea Bass - $28.95 - very good but in my opinion, pretty small for the price. It's deep fried in some kind of a chili sauce.

I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back. The service was great, atmosphere was great, and the food....yum, FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Best Northern Thai food I've had. Khao soi with crispy duck was so good. I've made it a point to stop here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that has recieved so much fanfare and hype that it is impossible for the restaurant to meet such high expectations.

I ordered take out on Mondy night as I was travelling through the city. The place was packed. I ordered the thai beef salad, beef jerky, and some sort of curry with beef short ribs. The beef salad was AWESOME. Exactly how I like it. The meat was tender and full of flavor. 

The jerky gets a mixed review. The pieces that I was able to chew and eat were really great. Great beef flavor with a great mix of spices. No sauce needed. However, there were a couple of pieces in the order that were inedible due to being too chewy and fatty. 

The curry was forgettable. The beef short ribs were not that great either. I ended up throwing away a lot of it. 

I definintely want to try other items on my next trip through LV. Worth the visit, but please order take out and avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"hole in the wall. who knew it would be so popular. photos of celebs that have eaten there on the wall. our party was 11 so it was awesome to have the opportunity to try numerous things. my faves there: pad thai, garlic fried prawns, crispy rice, garlic chicken wings, house fried rice. others that were ok: pad se u, crab fried rice, fried garlic lobster that was $99, some beef dish, some salty citrusy soup. the desert was just ok, probably would not order it again: fried bananas. 
i would def go there again."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I started to like Thai Food.  This place is what showed me there's more than just Pad Thai and augmented Chinese food dishes.  Growing up in NY, I'm used to some of the best places being a hole-in-the-wall so this place makes me feel right at home.  This restaurant is surprisingly inexpensive when you consider the type of dining experience you get at other restaurants on the strip.  My favorites are the crispy rice, duck in red curry and my all time favorite is the Nua Yang Prik Thai Onn, which is sliced steak that is as tender as you can imagine, sauteed with red chili paste and peppercorns.  I go to a level seven on spicy, but I'm a little crazy.  They also have an AMAZING wine list.  My favorite pairing is the mango w/sweet sticky rice and a dessert Gewurztraminer.   YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION! DO NOT JUST SHOW UP FOR DINNER! YOU WILL NOT GET A TABLE!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Lotus.  Have never had a bad meal here.  Would reccomend the deep fried Red Snapper with the sweet and spicy sauce.  Also the deep friend banana desert was amazing.  

Would also suggest having a reservation this place is ALWAYS packed. I have made the mistake at least twice of trying to go without a reservation."}
{"text":"The people here are too nice. The shrimp is too good. The wait is really long. This is the one place in Vegas I eat at every single time I'm there."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a bit off the strip, and sits in a sketchy area. There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren't inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.

We started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and \"fishy\" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.

My personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.

The dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.

To end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.

Back home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won't find any of these in China. The menu hasn't changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn't changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars just for the crispy duck in Penang curry and their mussels!  Amazing dishes. Ive eaten here several times and it remains to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  A great place for a date or to enjoy with a group of friends.  The location is a bit shady looking, but the food makes up for that!"}
{"text":"Spectacular, Spectacular, Spectacular, Wonderful !!!

My X and I went to vegas, and the trip was horrible (nuff said.....)

Fortunately  I have one amazing memory from the trip, and it was a hole in the wall called (Lotus of Siam)!  After our first day in the blistering hot desert we had the chance to hit up this savory little thai treasure.  

Eating here was a sensational taste journey into an adult willy wonka wonderland of thai delicacies both salty and sweet.  I will be back someday, and next time I will make sure i go with many~many~many friends so I can sample their entire menu of heavenly food.  

If I had a choice to live in peaceful blissful heaven with great food.  Or burn in hell every day for the rest of my mortal and immortal existence but partake in daily trips to Lotus, I'd choose an eternity in hell without thinking twice!

Lotus of Siam is the best thai food i've had to date in the US."}
{"text":"I've heard about the crazy long lines outside of this place and I've had it bookmarked for a while. I'm an avid Thai food eater so this place was definitely where I wanted to eat for my first non-partying weekend in Vegas. I went in on a rainy Friday evening, around 6:50pm, the weekend of the Pacquiao vs Bradley 3 boxing match. They quoted me for a wait time of 30mins but we actually got called to be seated in 3mins. They have an automated system where they text you when you're table is ready. 

The inside was nice and cozy. I really like the glass wine case that you see when you walk in. The lighting was dim but not too dark to set the ambiance just right. The place seemed clean although I don't know how much I trust carpet in a restaurant..

We ordered a Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, beef Penang curry, and a Thai tea. They brought out the 2 noodle dishes first and then the curry. I ordered beef penang but the waiter brought out chicken. A minor hiccup, I simply told the waiter I had ordered beef and so he had it changed for me. 

I judge a Thai restaurant by their Pad Thai and their Thai tea. I must say I was a little disappointed with the pad Thai. It was a little dry and lacking in flavor. The Thai tea was great though. The beef Penang curry was good. I got a 3 on their spicy-ness scale and it was perfect for me. The Pad See Ew dish was the best thing we ordered though. It was moist and flavorful. I would definitely order the Pad See Ew over the Pad Thai the next time I come here."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and then some. I've never had a disappointing dish here. There's so much more to try, it'll take me years to sample everything. Can't wait for my next trip!"}
{"text":"The claims made about the food at this restaurant have likely caused this placed to be rated lowly by people here who were expecting the most incredible dining experience of their lives.  Well, this isn't a fancy restaurant, it's not in a nice area, and nobody should ever get the buffet.

If you do go here, don't order items that you have enjoyed at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.  The best items on the menu here are the ones that you probably have never eaten before.  A lot of the things that are staples at Thai restaurants are served at Lotus of Siam, but they are not done with a flourish and they might even be disappointing.

I've eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times, and there have been some mediocre meals and some truly outstanding meals.  The charbroiled beef dishes are all excellent, the seafood dishes are consistently great, and some of the curries are interesting and delicious.  There are some good dishes on the Northern menu, but there have been some that I haven't enjoyed as much.  The first time I went to Lotus of Siam I ordered the crispy rice appetizer, and I have ordered it on every subsequent visit.  The flavor of that unusual dish is simply amazing.  Also, the coconut ice cream with sticky rice is a perfect end to a spicy Thai meal, and at $4 it isn't too costly, either.

So, if you want to enjoy the food here, don't go for something you've already had elsewhere.  Ask the waiter for a recommendation (they have ALWAYS given me good advice), get the crispy rice, a glass of Riesling, and finish up with dessert.  Oh, and make a reservation, or you'll be waiting a really long time for a table."}
{"text":"I can forgive the too long of a wait for fried bananas and 1 scoop of coconut ice cream since the food was out of this world delicious. The khao soi with crispy duck, garlic prawns, northern larb and sai oua (grilled sausage) were insanely good. The papaya salad was just ok and I would probably skip it. 

The restaurant is in a strip mall and it's next to an adult day care center. But who cares?!! As soon as you start eating, you'll be transported to a very happy place.

Glad my parents hightailed it out of NY to retire in one of the suburbs of Las Vegas. I can't wait to visit again and eat here until my stomach explodes."}
{"text":"Love the hot pot and also ask for both menus (the authentic menu)"}
{"text":"Now that I'm back, I wish I had ordered from their main menu, but the lunch buffet was a quick and affordable (and reservationless) way to get a feel for their food. Had probably the best pad thai I've ever tasted, delicious (but spicy!) green beans and chicken, heavenly pork noodle soup, salt and pepper chicken wings which had a perfect crust on them, and sweet potato curry puffs that, as a fan of all things sweet, I loved."}
{"text":"Hidden (or not so hidden these days) gem off the Vegas strip. Worth the 10 minute short drive for the best meal I had in Vegas. We were the first to arrive for lunch on a Thursday, and the restaurant filled up within minutes. Delicious and fresh with reasonable portion sizes, highly recommend the garlic prawns as a special decadent treat as well as the pad see ew. Very well priced compared to restaurants on the strip. Definitely check this place out and get there early, you won't regret making the trip!"}
{"text":"This place had a lot to live up to, as many reviews and articles claimed that this is the best Thai restaurant in the U.S.  I'm sure there are others that are just as good, but I have to say that this place didn't disappoint.  The garlic prawns were amazing, and the service was great!  We came just in time, 8 minutes before it opened, so we didn't have to wait long.  They came to take our order as soon as we were ready, and the food came in a flash.  Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in America? I think not. 

I mean the food was good and it was tasty. But I like my food HOT. It all came out luke warm. humm.... My favorite dish was the seabass over drunken noodles b/c it was the only one that came out HOT and it tasted yummy. 

The wine we got was not a good one. Some type of Riesling. 

Maybe we came on a bad day but overall not that impressed."}
{"text":"4 of us just came out of the restaurant very disappointed. Compared to most Thai restaurants this place lacks in quality of food and atmosphere and the prices are high. It's in an ugly strip mall and we expected authenticity instead found low quality and high prices. The place is designed to feed many with marginal service."}
{"text":"I've been dying to eat at Lotus of Siam, so last week when I was in Vegas I made sure we had a reservation. 

I was not disappointed. 

The garlic prawns were especially delicious. The prawns and skins are fried separately, then tossed in a sweet garlic sauce before serving. I had never eaten shrimp shells like this before and was completely mesmerized. Like the menu description, they really had the consistency of potato chips! 

The only negative I can find is that the portions seemed a little small compared to the prices. But even with that in mind, it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I first went to Lotus of Siam sometime last year, and didn't return until sometime last month.  I loved the food the first time around, it's just that my friends and I have been trying to go to all the restaurants we discover on Yelp!  When I ate there last year, it was before the restaurant had been remodeled.  It was a small space for such a popular restaurant, and reservations seemed to be the way to go.  Now that should have changed with the recent remodel, which added more dining space, a bar and large wine selection.

All of the dishes I've had here have been delicious.  I could live off of the pad thai and crab fried rice.  (Funny story about the crab fried rice: during our first visit we were trying to order fried rice, but with chicken or shrimp, something that wasn't crab.  Our pushy waitress told us, \"No, you want the crab fried rice.\"  After she repeatedly insisted we get that, we gave in; we were not disappointed.  We DID want the crab fried rice, we just didn't know it yet!)  I can't comment as to what other dishes I've had there, as I'm not very familiar with thai food.  The only other thai restaurants I have under my belt are Archi's Thai Kitchen and Thai Spice (where I always get the orange chicken...).

As you can probably tell by most of the reviews, the food ranges from good to outstanding.  I'll let you read everyone elses reviews since, like I said, I'm not well versed when it comes to thai.  However, the one thing I do feel I need to talk about is the service.  It is absolutely great that the dining space has been expanded, allowing more tables for guests to be seated at.  What I don't like is that the waiters/waitresses did not appear to be assigned to a specific area or set of tables.  There were a lot of employees working during the Friday night I went there, many of whom served my table at one point or another.  I don't think we had the same server visit our table twice that night, which made it annoying when trying to flag someone down.  I can't count the number of times I saw a server with a tray of food standing around looking lost and confused, wondering which table the order belonged to.  Trying to get more water, order more dishes, order dessert, or get the check was a trial in patience.

Does the quality of the food outweigh my bad experience with the service?  Yes, it does.  But when i recommend this place to friends, the recommendation will always be accompanied by a footnote to be prepared to do a lot of sitting and waiting."}
{"text":"LoS is overrated. Quality maintenance is harder than quality attainment. I don't think it's so much that the staff is lazy or disinterested. It's just that it's hard to stay motivated to cook aggressively and ambitiously when the clientele isn't aggressive or ambitious in its ordering and dietary habits. This fault isn't particular to ethnic restaurants: most high-end restaurants succumb to the same pattern of early greatness followed by plateau and then slow, steady decline (if they ever reach the heights to begin with).

To be fair, the food was very good. It was not extraordinary or even top 10%. Fresh mushroom salad was an interesting idea, half-realized. The two shrimp that accompanied the salad were fine, but not of the same quality as at a much more unprepossessing restaurant I visited two nights later. The salad itself was a bit monochromatic.

I did enjoy a dry beef liver entree, though it was not nearly as spicy as my server averred. He helpfully provided some condiments and recommendations. 

My server, in fact, helped me to my conclusion that LoS wasn't terrific. I'd gone to LoS expecting that it would be overrated. But I don't like to prejudge. My server was more enthusiastic in recommending other Thai restaurants than he was in talking about his own menu. I do not mean that he was unprofessional or that he spoke negatively about his employer. It was just clear by his demeanor that he prefers to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here while on my mini-moon in Vegas this past November.  The strip mall it's in is sorta ghetto and depressing (tons of parking, though), but the restaurant itself is nice and quaint.  I heard that it's tough to get a table, so we got there about 10 mins before they opened on a Wednesday.  There were already two other people waiting for them to open, as well.  A steady stream of folks were filling up the seats as soon as they opened.  By the time we left, almost all the tables were full.

The food is good, but to be honest, didn't blow my mind.  I think all the hype set my expectations pretty high.  The food was still great, though.  We ordered the larb to start.  It was tasty, but there was definitely a lot more rice than meat.  We also got the crsipy prawns, which was my fave. They take the shrimp out of the shell, but still leave it connected, then they deep fry it, so you have one part fried shell and one part fried shrimp.  Really tasty.  We got the drunken noodles, too.  They were OK - was like a brothy pad see ew.  I was expecting a thicker sauce, but it felt more soupy than saucey.  We didn't order wine, but their wine cellar was HUGE and they had a bunch of awards on the wall for their wine list.

The service was AMAZING!  Extremely attentive, friendly and knowledgable.  They really made the experience great.  They also have a huge menu, so there's a lot of dishes to choose from.  
Overall, I'm glad we went, just so we can say that we tried it.  If we're in that part of town, will ddefinitely go again."}
{"text":"What a great meal! I had the crispy duck curry and it was a treat. Only reason I'm taking a star is because my food was cold. After they warmed it up it was awesome. There was a line out the door when I arrived so I would suggest getting there early."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is awesome!! The location, which is in a strip mall about one mile east of the strip is quite uninspiring but the food at Lotus of Siam is anything but! I've heard that dinner reservations are very difficult to come by as they're backed up for weeks, so I recommend visiting for lunch. That's what we did and were seated right away. Based on other yelp reviews and Anthony Bourdain as well, it's highly recommend that you order from the Northern page on the menu. That's what this restaurant specializes in and that's why it's world renown. The prices were very reasonable and the flavors are out of this world! I'm by no means a connoisseur of Thai cuisine but I'm definitely a big fan of it. That being said, as far as I'm concerned, Lotus of Siam is as good as it gets! Definitely visit and don't be afraid to take a leap of faith from the Northern page. Just don't get frustrated if you can't get a table for dinner."}
{"text":"There is a part of me that feels sad writing this review.  Why?  Because I used to love this place so much.  It had been a while since I was last here and I was really looking forward to a great LOS experience.  Several years ago, I ate here so often and brought in so many people that the staff even gave me a free shirt.

Alas, those glory days are over.  Their portion sizes have shrunk, the prices have gone up, and the service leaves something to be desired.  

I arrived early for dinner to beat the wait and when my party of 4 was seated, they only gave us 2 menus and no wine list.  After a little while, the server came over to take our drink order.  When we let him know that we wanted to order wine, but we still weren't offered a wine list.  I decided not to push the issue and went with just a glass of his choosing instead of a bottle and then placed our dinner order.

Our appetizer was stuffed chicken wings.  2 chicken wings for $11.   They're good chicken wings, but not $11 good.  With a party of 4 people, I'm surprised our server didn't advise us that there would only be two.  Try putting 4 on the plate and then the pricing might make sense.  

The combination beef noodle soup was very good. I'll admit - I'm an Asian soup noodle guy.  Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen.  This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats.  Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin.  Good portion at a very reasonable price.  

Our Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past.  Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town.     

The whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh.  Seasoning was okay, but I'm guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer).  It had that \"stale chicken\" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it's sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy.  Although it's cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small.  Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though.  The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.

My biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck.  This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it.  When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self.  The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to.  Was it horrible?  No.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely not.  I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine.  I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1/4 of a duck.  He said that he hadn't worked there very long but it's been that way as long as he'd worked there.  1/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25?  Yikes!  It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.

The verdict?  Completely average food, small portions, and big prices.  From now on, I'll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars?  Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.

The good news out of all of this?  The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently.  Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour.  So, if your heart's set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table."}
{"text":"First Thai place I've ever seen with a line out the door!

This place is a well oiled machine, first of all. We were in at 530, out at 620pm for our party of 6.

Service was good and friendly.

Now the food.
Drunken noodle with soft she'll crab - decent, but not mind blowing
Garlic shrimp - ditto, and in fact, a bit overdone
Crispy duck with red panang curry - very tasty, but could have used a little more curry
Pad sew - pretty standard 
Spicy beef salad - dressing was thicker than I've seen in Thai town (LA) and was heavy on tamarind.  It was tasty but, again, didn't wow me.

All in all, food was tasty and authentic, service was fast and friendly, but the portions were small for what you pay (compared to standard size thai servings ).

A good experience but still more hype than anything else.  I'll stick to what I know in LA's Thai food scene.  

Solid 3.5 at best!"}
{"text":"Its not far from the strip, and its location (in a seedy strip mall!)  is confusing, given that it is considered one of the best Thai restaurants in the US. Make sure to make a reservation well in advance, as I tried to do a walk in, and was told I would have to wait an hour, and as I glanced at their appointment book, I notied that they had many many reservations for up to a week in advance. Note that they do not take reservations for lunch. 

There were tons and tons of non-Asians here, (more non-Asian than Asian), so you can be sure that if you bring non-Asian friends here that chances are they will love the food as much as you do and that the food is appealing to them as well 

due to scheduling conflicts, I wasn't able to dine here for dinner, but lunch, which offers the option between ordering from the menu and the buffet. My party was starved so we opted for the buffet. It was great - they had pad thai, friend rice, two different soups, egg rolls, fried banana, fruit, salad, some other thing sI don't quite remember - it was a pretty small buffet though. I really enjoyed it. My In laws enjoyed it immensely as well. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definetely visiting them for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place looks super sketchy from the outside. However, once you walk in, it is packed with tourist. There are cabs always in front of the restaurant. This was my first time going to this restaurant. I must say that the restaurant is quite spacious and surprised how packed it was. They have huge selection of wines so, all you wine lovers definitely check it out. It is inside a glass case where you can see each wine. I ordered pineapple fried rice and Thai tea. The tea was amazing. It's definitely better than Archi's. The fried rice was quite dry. I don't think I'll order it again. The good news is that the shrimp in my fried rice didn't smell fishy. Overall, the service was great and I would go back even as a local. I doubt that I'll go during the weekends because of the long wait. I wish they took reservations or at least call aheads."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that quality has been declining since their heyday.  When I originally tried them two years ago at their original location, every dish seemed to be a revelation.  Their Pad See Ew, was Pad See DAMN!  Their duck with Panang curry was something I would show off to my family and friends.

Nowadays, I can see why other Elites are saying it's not what it used to be.  Even with their new location, after years of hype and over flow of customers, we were waiting a while for our food.  We ordered the Pad See Ew again, and their Tom Yum soup.  The food was decent, like 7.5/10, but not what blew my mind those years ago.  

It's not bad, and prices are actually reasonable considering the decor and reputation, but for the wait and quality of food there are lot other competitors in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've ever had.  Taking my family and guests here is a treat.  I can't recommend the crispy duck and the Pad See Ew enough!

The ambience is whatever.  The restaurant is huge, with tons of seating.  They always over-quote you on the wait but I typically end up waiting 20 minutes, which is fine for what I believe is the best Thai food in town.  It's a bit pricey and out of the way in the ghetto, otherwise I'd be coming a lot more often.

Service is fine.  I don't feel ignored, underwhelmed or impressed.  It's the food that you come here for.

There's plenty of parking in the strip mall, and it's not hard to find."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp, and when I read that this was 'the best Thai restaurant in the country\" I had to stop by on my recent trip to Vegas.  My bf and I were pretty excited to check this place out and took a $15 cab ride to this whole in the wall for lunch.  Between the two of us, we had 

1) Koong Sarong (deep fried prawns wrapped in bacon and rice paper)

2) Nam Kao Tod (Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice)

3) Yellow Curry Chicken

4)  Pad Sw-Ew Chicken (Stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce).

Of the 4 dishes, my favorites were probably the yellow curry and the prawns.  As for the other two dishes, I kinda had high expectations for them because they're one of my favorite Thai dishes.  Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met.  The food here is good, just not good enough to be considered 'the best' based on what i've ordered.  Pad sw-ew is like a thai staple for me, just like pad thai for some other people, and it didn't surpass my standards  for this dish.  I'd have to say that King of Thai in San Francisco is still my favorite."}
{"text":"I thought the Lotus of Siam was good, but I wasn't blown away. My expectations were sky high because of it's reputation. Reviews are off the chart, and even the hotel bellman and the cab driver got excited at the mention of it. The cabbie yells \"hell yeah, that place is the bomb!\"

I ordered the Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck in Drunken Noodle. The prawns were huge. They  are removed from their shells and butterflied, but still attached to their shells (at the tail). The prawns are then dredged in a seasoned batter and deep fried. The fried batter was similar to Japanese tempura and the flavor reminded me of the Chinese-style, deep fried salted shrimp. You can definitely eat both the shrimp and shell, and I like that they were separated. The garlic flavor is prominent. This is one of their most popular dishes, and it is a safe choice.

The duck dish was good, but I didn't think it was great. There was a generous amount of sliced duck. The dark duck meat was fatty and the skin was crispy. The drunken noodles are the flat wide noodles that are common in a lot of Asian dishes. The brown sauce was flavorful although I would have preferred it to be a bit more spicy. I ordered spice level of 6 out of 10 because I was expecting the Thai scale. Their heat scale is toned down for Westerners

Overall it was a good experience, and I'm glad we tried because of all the buzz. I have heard many people say it \"the best Thai food in America\". I didn't agree on this visit, but would give it another chance. I preferred the prawn dish over the duck, but would not recommend either. The menu is large so there are plenty of other interesting options."}
{"text":"So this is supposedly one of the best Thai restaurants in America, eh?

Considering I live in what is probably the highest concentration of Thai restaurants in NYC, I had to check LoS out for myself.  

The result?  A 4.5.  I wouldn't say this was perfect, as I had some individual dishes elsewhere that I thought were on par or better than LoS, but some other dishes were also total standouts.  

Fortunately I was here with a large group, so we were able to sample a huge variety of dishes.  My impressions:

Appetizers
Golden Tofu - Nice texture and not too greasy.  Small, bite-sized portions were nice and this was definitely better than what you find in an average Thai joint (4/5)

Chicken Satay - Not bad, and the chicken they used was tender and not overcooked.  But there are other places that serve something comparable (3/5)

Nam Kao Tod - This was surprisingly my favorite dish of the night.  This appetizer had both amazing flavors and textures.  The crispy rice and sour pork were just divine.  Note, this dish is absolutely fucking spicy.  Your anus will burn later on if you don't ask them to tone down the spice up front, but it's still a tasty dish (5/5)

Soups
Tom Yum Koong - Maybe it could have been spicier, but that's probably because the Nam Kao Tod blew out my senses so this didn't feel that intense.  I really liked the freshness of the shrimp with this soup. (5/5)

Salads
Chicken Larb - For me this dish often is a sign of how legit a Thai place is.  For the most part I enjoyed it, though I can honestly say there are many places in NYC that I've had way better, at least for me.  (3/5)

Chef's Choice
Chilean Sea Bass with Suki Sauce - OMG so tasty.  Absolutely awesome fish that had a great mix of spice, crunch, tenderness and flavor.  Enuff said. (5/5)

Garlic Prawns - One of their signature dishes and with good reason.  Holy shit this was my favorite dish along with the Nam Kao Tod.  It was absolutely perfect in terms of freshness, flavor, texture and balance.  You must order this (5/5).

Noodles
Pad Thai - Definitely one of the more refined Pad Thai's I've had in a long time.  While it was good in terms of taste, I could have actually used even more in terms of flavor, but that's just me.  At least the texture was solid.  (4/5)

Pad Se Ew (pork) - I liked this WAY better than the Pad Thai.  The flavor was kick ass and if you're not careful you can literally gulp down an entire plate of this.  I can live this plate of flat noodles and some garlic shrimp and that'd be a perfect meal for me.  (5/5)

Dessert
Coconut Ice Cream over Coconut Rice - My tablemates loved this.  I mean they wanted to inhale this.  I thought it was good but it didn't blow my mind.  The slightly salty texture of the rice definitely was legit compared to the desserts I ate while living in SE Asia, but I preferred the ice cream sans rice.  (3/5)

All in all, the meal was satisfying and about as memorable as it can get when you're with a loud group of friends drinking Singha beer to wash down all the spice.  The service here was nice and the vibe here with relaxed.

So is it worth schlepping your ass off the Vegas strip to visit this dinky place in the middle of a random strip mall?  If you like Thai food, the answer is definitely yes.  Is it the BEST Thai I ever had in my life?  At certain points, yes and at other points definitely no.  But it is a great holistic experience that's worth the effort if you have the time to stop by."}
{"text":"The wait is never long. The food is fantastic. I always s get the garlic prawns and the pas see ew is soooooo goood.  This is my go to Thai place in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count, and way before it was on T.V. This place is definitely worth the wait!! It can be tricky to find if you're new, but a taxi will know where it is, or just remember to turn at the green building. The green chili lime prawns are amazing!! Everything is fantastic, and try something off their Northern Thailand Menu in the back. If possible, have someone in your group get there earlier to put in your reservation, they stopped answering their phones years ago. The strip mall may seem sketchy, but that's typical old Vegas. You won't need your gun in this part of town, you'll be too stuffed to use it anyways."}
{"text":"Friends and I celebrated my birthday at Lotus last night. We called and made a reservation (this place is always busy so I highly recommend calling ahead), and when we checked in, we were seating immediately. 
Service was very attentive to all our needs. And the food per usual was perfection! We like spicy, and spice is what we got. Everything is fresh, full of flavor, and always leaves me wanting more. I was already asking my husband when can we go back. 

My favorite must haves on the menu:
(I may not be spelling these correctly)
-nam kao tad (crunchy rice dish appetizer)
-Thai eggplant beef salad
-#58 sliced beef dish with lots of garlic, hot Thai peppers, served on a bed of cabbage
-garlic shrimp; you can eat the whole thing, nice and crunchy

I highly recommend Lotus! Delicious every time"}
{"text":"Just going to put in my two cents- this place is definitely good as evidenced by all the positive reviews. We had the garlic prawns, jackfruit salad, and crispy duck curry with noodles. 

We couldn't decide between curry, crispy duck, or drunken noodles, so we took a shot in the dark with that last order (crispy duck curry with noodles)- what could go wrong? Crispy duck is delicious. Noodles were okay. I didn't love the curry, because it didn't have many spices. It tasted mostly like coconut to me. I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, so I asked my cousin (a Vegas local) and she confirmed that is just how they make their curry. It's not my favorite, but did not detract from the crispy duck. If I were to do it again, I would get crispy duck on just about anything else.  

The jackfruit salad was sour, salty, spicy- full of flavor. The jackfruit was cooked and shredded, so it had a meaty texture.  (Not a raw salad, like papaya salad.) The seasoning was similar to the seasoning on any larb dish. I ate my salad on rice, and it was delicious.

Garlic prawns were pretty good too. The batter was crispy and the garlic topping was delicious. Worth the one hour wait in the sketchy parking lot."}
{"text":"hidden away from the strip in a nondescript mall is this gem of thai food. we were seated immediately for lunch and ordered

garlic prawns
drunken noodle

beef jerky - too tough

the prawns were AMAZING because they are crunchy and not oily and garlicky. the drunken noodles were just right too in terms of combination of spices and flavors. we couldn't resist and came back for more before we left!"}
{"text":"The food lives up to the hype. It's been a while since I've been there since I live out of the way, I do plan on going again in fall."}
{"text":"Okay the bar is set high even before you get seated. Award winning Thai food featured in Gourmet magazine and the list goes on and on in the waiting area..go ahead read. Overall prettty good Thai food but not the best I'd ever had. A word of warning I like my food spicy but the medium woke me up QUICKLY and the portions are small. 

We meaning 6 of us had 

Green Papaya Salad X2 (ask for mild..you'll thank me later) we had it medium 
Pork Larb.. tasty but okay 
Fish Cake Patties...flavorful 
Yellow Curry with Beef....comforting but ok
Bamboo Shoot Curry.....Whou hou spicy guud! 
Chicken Pad Thai...love my noodles!! 

Over all...good. Would I come agian...hmmmmm...yeah. Call ahead for reservations gets crazy busy! :) A bit overated. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Definitely best legit Thai food in the US! Better than some of the Thai food I've had in Thailand!"}
{"text":"Would you like the BEST Thai food in America? Go to Lotus of Siam. 

Such a hidden little gem in Vegas, in a not-so-classy strip mall, but trust me, the food is 5 stars. Anything you order on this menu will be terrific but the one thing you MUST order is the large Hot Pot of the Tom Yum Prawn Soup with lime & lemongrass. IT'S SOOOOOOO yummy & healthy. 

I wish they would open in LA because I can't drive to Vegas just for soup."}
{"text":"Came here recently while on a weekend Vegas trip. At first I thought, \"Really, Thai food off the strip. Why??? when there's SOO many other great restaurants to try. But I'm glad that we went, it's definitely a diamond in the rough. It's a causal place with a menu, much like other Thai places, thick as a novel. There was only two of us so we couldn't order that many things but everything was great. I think the highlight was their insane wine selection. And I didn't get a chance to really look but it must of been decent prices b/c the table next to us was ordering bottles of Cakebread, like it was soda or something. Our waitress recommended a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that we both enjoyed. 

Food: 
Sea Bass in ginger sauce- not the whole seabass that some Thai places give, but I think I like it better this way.
Shrimp Pad Thai- the other fattie I was with, seemed to like this dish alot. Kept ranting and raving about it being the best Pad Thai since being in Thailand. I guess there's some credibility to Chef P's statements
Green curry- loved it, nice and spicy. But could probably get that at any Thai place in LA. 

Next Vegas trip, will def make it a point to go back and try some other things and hopefully with a group of people so that we can order more dishes and this time get some bottles of wine!!!"}
{"text":"WARNING: RUBBER BAND IN THE GREEN CURRY! I saw a rubber band in our green curry so I complained to our server. He quickly took away the bowl, as if to destroy the evidence, and said that he'll inform the kitchen. I also complained to the manager but she merely said she will \"remind the kitchen to be careful\" with rubber bands. This is a serious hygiene and cleanliness issue. The server tried to remedy the situation by giving us a cup of coconut ice cream (we were a party of 7) but I felt that was a poor way of making up for their mistake. They never apologized. Someone in my family could have choked or swallowed that rubber band. If that could happen to our table, it could have happened to other tables as well. 

The food here was good but the rubber band incident made the experience horrible. I would think twice about eating here again."}
{"text":"There's a lot of great things about Lotus of Siam, it's just not up to par with SF Bay Area Thai. But for Las Vegas, it's worth a shot!

Brief Summary
-- Location is off the strip, felt like \"middle of nowhere\"
-- Must be a Local hot spot because it's packed and busy!
-- Service was decent
-- Food was pretty good
-- Experience was just A-OK

With all of the high profile chef's having restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip or in the fancy, new hotels,  I would have NEVER thought of getting some Thai food in LV. Thanks to Yelp, I checked this place out with my GF and even called ahead and got a reservation on a busy Wednesday night!

This place doesn't look as big or as nice as it does inside. The outside made me feel like we were in the slums but the inside of the restaurant was very welcoming and nice. 

Service was a little bit slow at times but eventually our server opened up and gave us a smile and great customer service. I guess he just needed some time to warm up.

--- Our Order ---

** Tom Kha Gai with veggies -- I think this one of the best dishes of the night. We asked for medium heat, and they delivered! The heat was strong when you ate the peppers in the soup, but otherwise it wasn't completely overbearing or too much. We were a little surprised at first but then were relieved that our mouths weren't completely on fire. We got the Hot Pot size and it was $14 ( a little expensive ), but the portions were HUGE. So it made sense. I definitely recommend this coconut based soup with chicken and vegetables.

** Chicken Satay -- I like simple dishes. This dish was simple and delicious. BBQ chicken on skewers with a great peanut sauce and the cucumber salad. 

** Pad Thai with Chicken -- I'm not a fan of places that serve Pad Thai with ONLY a certain type of meat. I'm used to having some egg, chicken, tofu and shrimp in my noodles. So it would have been nice to have a few mroe ingredients, but in general the pad Thai was good. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I like, but the flavor was very good. Pad Thai is the \"make or break\" dish for me, and I feel like they delivered well with the Pad Thai.

** Pineapple Fried Rice -- This was probably the weakest dish. It wasn't very \"fried\" but more like a rice mixed with curry powder. It made the rice have a lackluster texture that was in between moist and dry. It was confusing. The pineapple did deliver a nice fresh crunch and juice, but I've had better.

After going over my whole order, it wasn't that this place isn't good. Everything was good, but nothing WOW'd us or made me want to go out of my way for Thai in Las Vegas. If you're hankering for some Thai in LV, make a trip out here. Don't blink, or you'll miss it!

** Quick Side Note -- They have a HUGE selection of Wine. If that's your \"thing\" then they will definitely be able to get you something that fits your meal."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had. Everything was so good. Veggie egg rolls & war won ton soup and service was good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best thai restaurant in the country.
INCREDIBLE wine list with a lot of bargains. 
Extensive menu that covers many regions of Thailand. Friendly service. I make sure to go each time I am in Vegas. I love this restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the long wait. I would imagine this is one of locals best kept secrets. The restaurant is nestled in a shopping plaza that isn't exactly thriving but it's all happening at Lotus of Siam. The food was delivered quickly and was as delicious as the many other reviewers say."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was the best Thai food in town.  I can think of two places that are better and cheaper: Pho Kim Long in Chinatown and Bangkok 9 in Henderson.  This is not to say that Lotus of Siam wasn't good.  It's just that it wasn't as good as everyone makes it out to be.  And it's overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday cause I love Thai. What I loved was the green curry with tofu. Best I've ever had. Also excellent were garlic shrimp and soft crab drunken noodle. I wasn't so crazy about the papaya salad or the Tom Yum Kung. I wish I had more opportunity to taste every item on the menu."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain's TV show brought me here and it didn't disappoint. I got the Prik King with beef and the Khoa Soi and it was delicious. I got Prik King mildly spicy but it was still spicy. So, if you don't like it hot, I recommend getting no spicy or very low spicy. I was told my by the waitress that the Khoa Soi is customized dish so you can't really get it anywhere. I guess I'll have to come back....darn. :)"}
{"text":"this new location is 100x better than the old one. although it is still in a kinda sketchy location, the decor on the inside is phenomenal.

Food wise, i would say the quality is a lot better here as well. i tried the garlic prawns at the old location (twice) and i was not very fond of it. then i tried it again here and i was in love! not to mention the other dishes being superb as well.

I feel like they have more staff here too. at the old location, i felt as though they were just pushing around a cart of garlic prawns and any table that ordered it, they would drop one off. as though it wasn't made-to-order. i feel that this new location is much more high class and just better overall. even though it did take longer for our food to come, i feel like it was actually made-to-oder.

i've heard that they're deciding on keeping only one location, and as of now, i vote for this new one to stay!!"}
{"text":"HAD to try this place after Anthony Bourdain's recommendation on Parts Unknown, and I FELL IN LOVE!!! if you watched that episode of Parts Unknown, the guy that Anthony Bourdain eats with at this restaurant says to try something from the \"northern\" part of the menu, and he's right!! DON'T try anything typical - pad thai, pad see ew, etc. BRANCH OUT!!

Under the \"northern\" section, we chose the Khoa Soi with beef, which is a noodle dish with a sauce that is similar to panang, but lighter. Under the \"chef's special\", we ordered the Crispy Duck Panang because it was so popular on Yelp. OH. MY. GOSH. Both of those dishes were delicious. But the Crispy Duck Panang was on another level. The duck was so well prepared. You can taste the crispiness of the skin. I expected the duck to be soggy because it's in the panang sauce, but no. It was fresh, it was crispy, it was delicious. There is definitely a lot of spice in the dish, but it was still amazing.

Portions wise, each dish was on the small side. I typically only finish half of my entree from most restaurants, but I was able to finish my crispy duck panang and my boyfriend was able to finish his dish as well. The price point is also pretty high - over $20 for each of the dishes, but they were definitely worth it. I've never tried thai food like this before.

Wait time: we came on a monday night, about 20 minutes after they open and it was already pretty packed in the restaurant. One hour after it opened, there was a huge gathering of people waiting for tables. If you can, get a reservation or come when it opens because you definitely need to try it."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. This place is way off the strip and you would probably want a car to get there. Taxi would be expensive I bet. We came here for lunch and arrived around noon and there was a line out the door. Some of the people were there for the lunch buffet and after looking at it, I didnt want to waste a meal on cheap fried stuff. The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.

Garlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.

Nam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.

Tofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.

Mango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.

Overall, it is a good Thai place in Vegas and I guess it is similar to Krung Thai in San Jose. Nothing crazy status but a good change than the regular buffet."}
{"text":"I have one word to really sum up Lotus of Siam, disorganized. Getting served by more servers than people in your party, having dishes from different tables taken to your table, and having to wait half an hour to be noticed is not what I was expected for a place held in such high regard. It was a mess.

I will give it to Lotus of Siam for having delicious pad thai and one of the best fried rice dishes (the crab fried rice is ridonkulous) I've ever had. The other dishes we ordered were..... interesting. Different styles of sausage, what I believed to be some sort of beef with vegetable dish, and meekrob, definitely new flavors to my palate. While not bad I can't say that they were up my alley with every dish aside from the pad thai and fried rice having a very strong, unique flavor. Maybe I just haven't given the dishes enough of a chance to grow on me but after that circus of an experience I will not be coming back any time soon.

Side note: Stay away from the red and green drink. Seriously."}
{"text":"DInner was delicious. Reservations are a MUST, otherwise you'll be waiting in a long line. We ordered a couple of basics -- Pad Thai and Green Curry. Both absolutely delicious. 

My son mentioned he was going to Thailand and the server recommended several places to go. He was so friendly, as is most of the staff there. 

One note. There's no hard liquor, just beer and wine. Which was fine by us. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The fried garlic prawns....you.must.get.this.

This is the kind of dish you side eye people for. Like when the last one is there and you politely try to pick at the scraps and avoid that last delicious prawn that is beckoning you in its crispy, golden glory. Screw it. Fight your family and friends off for that last one!"}
{"text":"To start off it took about 10 minutes for someone to come take our drink order, and at least 10 more to take our food order.  We started with a Tom Yum hot pot, and it was okay, I've had better.  The kids had the combo fried rice which was quite yummy, and we also tried the pad see ew.  It was delish, had a very good stir fried flavor.  We also ordered some kind of steak salad, which was just too sweet, we could only handle a couple bites.  All in all, I've had better thai food for taste, price, and portion size.  If you are ever in  Austin, TX head over to Titaya's for awesome Thai."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely the best!! The food was great but I think I was more impressed by the customer service. It was our last day in Vegas and we heard such positive reviews from other ppl so we decided to try it out. From the hostess to our waitress to the bus boys. They were all veryyyyy pleasant and helpful. Then the food itself OMG was so good. I had the seafood Thai fried rice, best I've ever had! Honestly I wish I could give them more than 5 stars, they deserve it"}
{"text":"tom YUM YUM YUM!!!

this place is superb--- a hidden gem! it's very casual, but don't let appearances fool you, they serve TOP CUISINE here! among the best thai food, I have ever had! 

and I am ecstatic to know they are opening one up in NYC soon =)!"}
{"text":"My good friend Mike mentioned that this place is amazing and he wasn't kidding! We went here as a group and let him do the ordering. We had this spicy beef (Nua Yum Katiem) that was absolutely delicious! The Crispy duck was amazing as well as everything else he ordered for us. We had  a few appetizers and some noodle dishes as well. The prices were reasonable and there was plenty of food for everyone. It's all served family style. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the location isn't the best, but the food definitely makes up for it. I've always been a fan of Thai food and am a much bigger one since visiting Lotus. It really makes me look forward to my November trip to Thailand!"}
{"text":"This food at this restaurant definitely lived up to it's award winning reputation.  The fried sea bass over drunken noodles is an amazingly good dish.  The tom yum soup was very flavorful with a nice hint of fried garlic, but even at a spiciness level of 3 out of 10 it had tiny pieces of chopped up peppers that were very spicy if you bit into them.  The fried crispy rice with sausage had such interesting textures and flavors that I never had before, but I really loved it the more I ate it.  However, we didn't have a reservation, and the wait time they quotes us was 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting over an hour to get seated.  People around us consistently had to double the wait time quoted to them by the hostess, and even people who came in with reservations often had to wait 15 minutes."}
{"text":"An overdue review to add to the thousands of reviews.

They give you a 1-10 spice ratio. 7 is very very spicy. Get a 5 if you like spice but still want flavor.

We got the Tom Yum Soup, Glass Noodles, Khao Soi, and Red Curry. Everything was excellent except the Glass Noodles were only average. The Khao Soi is soooo good though.

Portions are small, so yes we had to order 4 dishes for 2 people."}
{"text":"Visited on my recent trip to Vegas.  They have a great Northern Larb and Chicken soup with glass noodles.  I was sharing with someone that doesn't eat spicy, so that limited me off of the Northern cuisine.  Would definitely try again.  I felt the service was decent.  The servers seemed stretched out over large areas...maybe because it was on a Sunday??"}
{"text":"One of the most reviewed restaurants in Vegas, figured we would give it a shot since we are big fans of Thai food. It definitely lived up to the almost 4K reviews. 

Looks a little run down from the outside but very organized, clean and welcoming from the inside. Arrived at 1PM on a Friday and was seated immediately. We had the fried garlic prawns and curry short ribs and both were out of this world! 

A little pricey at around $25+ per dish but well worth it for the taste. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are into Asian food."}
{"text":"The best!!! Food is absolutely delicious!! Garlic prawns are to die for.. excellent service and definitely worth the wait. Go!!"}
{"text":"This CANNOT be the best Thai food in America!  I have had far superior Thai food.  Not to say it's bad.  It's just... well, good.  That's what my three star review says.  If this was my neighborhood Thai restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate being a regular.  But I certainly wouldn't fly across the country to come eat here like I would... say, for Arun's in Chicago. 
After my first visit here a couple of months ago, I hesitated in writing a not-so stellar review.  I was puzzled at what the other people were tasting that I wasn't.  The other reason why I was reluctant to write one was 'coz I felt it would be an unfair write-up after only trying mostly their Northern Thai dishes.  Yes, we enjoyed the nam kao tod - minced sour sausage appetizer a lot but everything else paled in comparison to what I expected.  The northern larb was far inferior to the regular larb, and the much acclaimed kung ka noon which is a spicy young jack fruit curry was far from yummy - almost a dish that requires an acquired taste.  

I resisted from writing a two star review then... so today, we returned to order a bunch of food that weren't just what other moronic non-Thai- food-eating-'experts' claimed excellent, but ordered what we normally enjoy.  I feel that following food critics reviews on ethnic food may be a little tricky.  But having gone to Thailand a gazilion times since I was 3, went to cooking school there and grew up around the region, I know what Thai food (in the Bangkok area) should taste like.

Today we ordered the vegetarian egg rolls, tod mun plar (fish cakes), and yum woon seng (seafood glass noodle 'salad') for appetizers; crispy mussel omelette, chicken green curry and pad thai for entree.  Yes, two noodle dishes.  I love my noodles :)  My favorite dish at this meal was the mussel omelette.  It was close to what it should taste like and I enjoyed the nice crunch.  This dish is enjoyed both in Thailand and some other parts of South East Asia (though oysters are often used - minus the crispy part).  The green curry, I felt, lack flavor and spice even though we asked for very spicy (7 out of 10 for spice).  DO NOT order the pad thai here.  It is NOT what pad thai should taste nor look like.  We make much better pad thai at home lol!  

It was a good meal.  I walked out pretty contented with my Thai food craving.  Service was pleasant and friendly as was our first time dining here.   I just couldn't figure out what the lady was saying 80% of the time so I just agreed and smiled :D"}
{"text":"Best thai food ever. Amazing flavors, huge menu selection, affordable prices. It is hard to get a table at this place. You need to make reservations at least one week ahead and sometimes that is not enough. But the food is so worth it. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Super affordable and very, very good.  This may be the most flavorful Thai food I have ever eaten.  Our Uber driver asked how we found this place as mostly only locals or folks very familiar with Vegas know about it.
They serve beer and wine but not liquor.
I had the Nua Nam Tok, and it was so flavorful and perfectly cooked.  I think the total entrée price was $10.  A super great value for Vegas, and it was AWESOME."}
{"text":"Ok so I love Thai food. This place was also voted Best of Las Vegas a few times in the past few years. There are 2 things certain here. One. It's a popular place. Two. It's Thai food. Real Thai food. I like they have specials off the menu. I enjoy a lot of different things here from the Pad Thai, the red curry with numba 10 spicy. Their mint beef is pretty good too.  Mmmmm.....Their Thai Iced tea is not overly sweet. The staff is friendly and the cost is average. It's a very nice atmosphere. Overall, it's more of an \"upscale style\" thai restaurant. Don't eat during lunch at Buffet. You will be disappointed. Have dinner!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoyed the ambiance and food quality, I asked for brown rice instead of white. The waiter brought out a very small bowl, about 3/4 cup.  I ended up having to pay $3.50 for it and was not told by the waiter it was an extra charge.  Who charges extra for brown rice?  What a rip off.
The other issue that was disturbing was the women's bathroom stunk to high heaven.  It smelled like a sewer back up problem.  I wonder what the kitchen sewer was like.......the restaurant also got only a \"B\" rating from the health department which was 2 days ago."}
{"text":"I was forced to check this place out during my recent trip. My friend had seen it on some travel show and also had an article highlighting it from a magazine. It was said to be the best Thai restaurant on the west coast. Well after I heard that I had to see if this was true.

We called to make reservations however they don't take reservations. We took a taxi from our hotel and let me warn you that this is off the beaten path. When we arrive it was about 8PM and I honestly thought we were in the wrong spot. It's located in an old strip mall. 

Upon entering we found that the restaurant was packed, that's always a good sign. We sat down and proceeded to order a bottle of wine, Rudi Pichler Riesling. It went very nice with the spicy red curry. I am not a big meat person and would rather not touch the stuff. I do make exceptions and this visit was one of them. My friends and I usually opt for family style dining when we go out. It's no surprise that meat is ordered but I tend to leave them alone. 

We had the Tum Yum soup (I remember this because yum= yummy) which had a little kick but was excellent. Next came the entrées, forgive me because I don't have the names. Red curry sauce with duck, and Pad Thai. Remember what I said earlier about meat? Honestly the duck dish was prepared and presented beautifully. I had to take a nibble. The meat was tender but the outside was breaded lightly. Great texture. The red curry was perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and went very nice with the duck. Pad Thai was the best because the noodles were not mushy as some places tend to over cook, and the flavor came alive in my mouth! (I need to go back, my mouth is watering just writing this.)

After dinner we finished with some Tozai snow maiden sake and some banana dessert. Both were an amazing finish to a perfect meal."}
{"text":"While we ate here, I did not think it lived up to the hype...  Service or quality.  I probably wouldnt go back if someone else didnt recommend it."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Thai place I have yet to experience. Not to say that americanized Thai food isn't great, but simply being here was a breath of fresh air. The chef knows what he's doing. 

I got the Northern-style Tom Kah Kai (spicy chicken soup). It has no coconut cream and has green chili, tomato, onion, herbs, and spices. It didn't blow me away, but it was a great dish to try, and it was just what I was looking for. Even though it was light, it filled me up. Also really liked the massaman curry. Service was quick. We were in and out within 45 minutes. Casual, unassuming, quality restaurant that is a must-try when you're in DTLV."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but food came slow.  We were in town for a convention and had just about an hour to eat.  We ordered soup, appetizer and entree.  But by the entree arrived, we needed to head back and I had to pack it up for later.  I ate my duck curry a few hours later and it was still delicious.  Tom Yum Goong soup was fantastic and so were the spicy chicken wings which were cooked to perfection. 

My friend went back there for lunch the next day by herself."}
{"text":"My family and I was craving some thai food on our first night in Vegas and we stopped by here before checking into our hotel room. It's located in a strip mall on Sahara. The restaurant was surprisingly big and we got seated fairly quickly. The food was what really let me down. We ordered the shrimp tom yum soup (hot pot size), crab fried rice, thai papaya salad and beef pad se-ew. All dishes came out very petite and not meant for sharing. I would not recommend any of the dishes I ordered. The best dish was the crab fried rice. For the amount of food provided, the prices were high. I will not be coming back...not sure how this place got an average of 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place looked kinda shady. It's in a outdoor mall where half the stores are out of business. It's really a hole in the wall. 

Once inside the place is big. The food lived up to the hype and tasted good. Service was excellent. 

Really couldn't have asked for a better place to eat off the strip."}
{"text":"Good food. Long wait. there is parking, it is a bit from the strip."}
{"text":"As good as promised.  We ate family style and every dish was amazing.  The wine list is tough to beat."}
{"text":"Don't be scared of the sketchy location. It looks like it's apart of a ghost-town strip mall, but the line out the door will give it away. It's off the strip, but not too far. It's a pretty small restaurant and the menu is overwhelming, with choices from all cultures involving Thai food. Zippy servers, ours had good menu suggestions. This is some Thai to try."}
{"text":"Came by twice in December, once for lunch and once for dinner and they were both surprisingly disappointing! 

My first visit was towards the tail end of the lunch rush and the restaurant was merely 10% full, which should have been a tell-tale sign. My second visit was also towards the tail end of the dinner service and we were told that a table would take a good 30 minutes and were welcome at the bar. We were disappointed when we were shown our table in the annex behind the bar that had a good 15-20 tables free the entire time!

For lunch, ordered the basil prawns drunken noodles and they came out bland and cold. Sadly, this dish wasn't fresh as the noodles were mostly stuck together and below room temperature. The prawns were also cold...this should have been sent back to the kitchen...

Despite the relatively large price tag, it should be noted that portions were sufficient for a party of two!

Service was friendly by the staff. The restaurant is located in a decrepit mall and the interior is rather decrepit as well..

$34/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.."}
{"text":"This place is great food is mild to spicy however you like it. The nam prik ong is the best apitizer i have ever had"}
{"text":"Long wait but the food was worth it. Fried bananas and coconut ice cream dessert...yes please"}
{"text":"I love Lotus of Siam! 

I was not aware about it until my cousins not from town introduced me to this place. The wait time was worth it. We opted to order some drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. We had pad thai, crispy duck with panang curry, garlic prawns and nam prik. The pad thai had a njce combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy. Noodles were cooked al dente. The crispy duck was really crispy, and I was impressed how the sauce was flavorful and well crafted. Their garlic prawns were indeed garlicky! They included the shells, which I doubted at first but ended up munching because it was crisp and delicious. I was not fond of the nam prik, although the sauce had good flavors and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The menu is very diverse and gives an overwhelming number of options, each one more enticing than the last. The food tastes fresh and is always flavorful. Tonight I had crispy rice with sausage massaman curry, pork belly with basil, and to kah khi soup. Everything tasted amazing. This is a hard place to get a reservation for and the quality of their food shows why"}
{"text":"I've been a local in Vegas for 8 years now and LOVE taking my friends to Lotus of Siam! Their menu is amazing and the Chef is incredible so definitely try more than just the Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I hate to criticize restaurants but I have to do this review.  There are some positives and negatives to Lotus of Siam. 

Positives: 
Authentic Northern Thai Cuisine.  We ordered the Khao Soi, Nam Prik Noon, and the Crispy Rice dish...I'm forgetting the name.  I would say they are all very authentic and flavorful. 

Negatives: 
Wait time: tried to make reservations over the phone and was told not to bother because it wasn't that busy (Weds evening).  We got there and waited for over 45 minutes for a table. 

Service: though they were nice, after our first dish came we waited for another 45 minutes for our final two dishes to come and I had to remind the waiter that we still had food coming.  No real apology was given and we were served the Khao Soi, it was cold and it had been sitting there.  Someone done f'ed up. 

Price: $26 for cold Khao Soi with Crispy Duck.  Pass.  Total bill for two with no drinks was $60.  

Sorry, I'd rather eat at Chipotle for a week...

Also we are coming off a trip to Chaing Mai and we live near Thai Town in LA.  This is good food, don't get me wrong, but not even close to being worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Lotus is by far my favorite Thai restaurant.  When I was living in Las Vegas, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else for Thai, and when I did, I was disappointed.   This has been my preferred Thai restaurant for the last seven years.  Their best  dishes, in my opinion, are expressed through the Northern Thai selection on the menu.   It is their specialty.   My go to selection consist of the fried garlic prawns, steamed sea bass served over a bed of apples and grapes, in a peanut and fish sauce,  the seared scallops in a garlic sauce, and Tom Yum shrimp.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, just be sure to specify the level of spiciness desired, or you'll tango with a mouth of fire! 

The restaurant itself is old and located in a less than desirable area.  I say it adds to the charm lol.  Make reservations!  Monday through Saturday this place is BUSY!  If you don't make the prior arrangements prepare to wait in line.  The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable of the menu.  My favorite dishes have come from waitstaff suggestions.   I suggest going between 530 and 630 p.m or anytime after 830 p.m.  This is the less busiest time to dine in Lotus.   Consistency in flavor, texture, and presentation is slightly neglected when the restaurant gets slammed."}
{"text":"WAHHHHHHHHH Thai food is good for the soul, get it away from me cause its making me fat!! 

I've been here for their lunch buffet and dinner now. Both were really really good and offered a lot of choices.

Lunch buffet rockstars: yellow curry, noodle soup, pad thai (duh), fried bananas. 
The things I wasn't feelin so hot about: the hot and sour soup and the spring rolls. 

Dinner choices included the drunken noodles, shrimp wrapped in a blanket, tom ka chicken soup, panang curry, and some interesting stuffed chicken (can't remember the name!) I really truly loved all of these dishes. 

I don't know if I would agree that this is the best Thai restaurant in America cause lets be honest, who can master all those dishes on the menu? BUT I will definitely be taking out of towners here!"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about this place as an avid foodie and lover of Thai cuisine, I knew I had to try it. We had a 5:30 reso on a Wednesday afternoon; the place had a line around the door but separated into those with reservations and walk ins. We were seated immediately when they opened and every single staff member was friendly and welcoming. The new location is sophisticated yet comfortable, with an authentic ambiance that doesn't come across as kitschy. We were offered recommendations and given an opportunity to ask questions before ordering, and didn't feel at all rushed. We went with the \"egg roll\" appetizer to start-although these rolls are usually considered spring rolls at the Thai restaurants were used to (Detroit area). They had thin, freshly wrapped rice paper fried to golden brown perfection and full of mildly seasoned veggies and cabbage. The sweet and sour sauce was a great compliment to the savory and crunchy roll. One of the best spring rolls I've had! It was also vegetarian. Next we each tried a Tom Yum (hot and sour) soup, mine with shrimp and my fiancé's with chicken. He got a level 7 spice and I went with a 5. (Level 1-10 with 3 being a Tabasco sauce for comparison). They were generously spiced while still maintaining a depth of flavor from the lime juice, coconut milk, and meat broth. The shrimp and chicken in the soup was plentiful and not dried out whatsoever even after sitting out while we finished our rolls. It was rich but refreshing, the perfect soup. For entrees we split two dishes. First the signature Garlic Prawns, which are large fresh caught prawns flash fried in a light seasoned batter including the tail (which is delectable and edible like a crunchy snack) and coated in a herby garlic sauce with sesame seeds. It was simply amazing. The crunch was on point and flavor was clean but decadent; the shrimp were cooked just long enough. We also split a chicken pad Thai, which had just the right spice level and umami flavor to be a top 5 pad Thai, but the noodles were the star. They clearly have perfected the soaking and cooking of their rice noodles. They were velvety soft without becoming mushy and held onto the sauce. All over an amazing Thai food experience. We also ended up needing to leave early to head back to the strip and meet friends and took our entrees to go halfway through. The dishes held their integrity and were just as flavorful later on! Will be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents during a trip to Las Vegas. I've wanted to try this place after seeing it on andrew zimmern's show. 

We got there before noon and the restaurant was empty, but SOON after, it was jam packed! Got there just in time before the lunch crowd!

All the dishes were very tasty & we all enjoyed every dish we ordered. I liked  this one dish with fried pork belly and vegetables( can't remember what it's called). And the fried bananas with coconut iceream sure topped it off!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is one of the most popular places in Las Vegas. Be sure to make a reservation if you dont want to wait for 1 hour and a half on a Wednesday night. 

We ordered fried shrimps, cashew chicken and drunken noodles with Chilean sea bass. Shrimps were good but a bit underwhelming compared to their popularity! The other two dishes were really good. The sauce of the chicken dish was perfectly balanced, it would be my perfect go-to dinner meal. The star of the night were the drunken noodles. The flavors are really balanced and the juice that comes with the noodles makes this dish simply perfect! Sea bass was very well cooked as well. 

Service was very effective and quick. The place is very busy and big, so it is hard to feel relaxed (but this may apply to all Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"This place has been called \"The Best Thai Restaurant in North America.\" I'm not sure how this was determined, but the food is pretty delicious.  And, yes, you CAN get many items veganized here: the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and/or tofu combinations, from Pad Prik King to Chili Mint, to green curry (one of my faves!).  Just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are OK. (Sometimes red curry is made w/ shrimp paste).  The spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name! The phrase \"I can't feel my lips anymore, but I can't stop eating this!\" is commonly uttered.  You can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too! Sticky rice w/ mango, coconut ice cream (made w/ coconut milk FTW!), fried bananas.... all delish.

Bonus: they have Albarino(!!!!!) and Stone IPA on their drink menu, so I get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal.  

They have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity, so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too!  I would recommend a reservation on a Fri or Sat.... but if it's packed you can always trot over to Komol for some excellent chow as well.

I will say this though -- I have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that.  I also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner.  HOWEVER - when I take meat eaters to Lotus, I pretty much insist that they order off the Northern Thai menu.  Only one item on there doesn't have meat, but the dishes are very rarely found on American Thai menus... So just go for it already! If you're an adventurous eater, you'll probably love it."}
{"text":"I am glad I had a chance to visit this restaurant.  I never heard of this place, until my most recent trip to Vegas.  Dishes here are more expensive than the usual Thai restaurant.  In Vegas, you are going to be shelling out tons of money all over the place.  Maybe cut back on a few drinks at the club or a few lap dances less to save a few bucks to try this spot out if it would make you feel better. 

You will find some dishes here that you may not have encountered at other Thai restaurants.  This place gets real packed.  Non-stop taxi's dropping off people every minute it seems.  Make a reservation a day in advance if you have a large group.  There are very limited reservation slots.  

Ordered the Sausage, Deep Fried Garlic Prawns, Fried Peking Duck in Panang, Thai Beef Salad, and Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  

My favorites are:

Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - nicely fried, battered, and garlicky.  Enjoyed eating every part of the shrimp.  The skin is separated and deep fried as well.

Fried Peking Duck in Panang - I normally do not eat duck because it has a certain taste, but there are certain meats or dishes that you may not generally like, however, prepared a certain way and you might just fall in love with it.  I certainly enjoyed this dish.  Maybe because it was fried and sliced into thin pieces with thick skin.  Throw it in panang curry and perfect fusion flavor.  Some in the group thought it was a bit oily and greasy, but I did not mind.

Thai Beef Salad - rib eye beef, salad, and thai sweet lime dressing.  Tender beef, good sauce.  This was delicious. 

Sausage and the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass were good, but were my least favorite.  Sausage had a lot of flavor, but I did not find myself enjoying it more than other sausages that I've had.  Sea bass was cooked well, thick piece, but standard.  The noodles with deep fried soft shell crab sounds something more to my liking.  Maybe I will be back to order that someday."}
{"text":"What. The. Heck?? Why is this place so popular? I had to find out. My in-laws made a reservation here for the six of us to try Lotus of Siam's most popular dishes. We ordered what all yelpers suggest- Northern Thai food:

1. Khao Soi- best dish of the night. The curry base was delicious- not overpowering. very creamy. I've had better khao soi in LA. 

2. Northern larb (I didn't try it but it was well received by the others in our group).

3. Kang Ka Noon (spicy jack fruit curry with chicken)- Just ok. They warned us this dish is more of a soup, and it is. It is difficult to finish this dish without a spoon. The dish isn't spicy as advertised- maybe they tone it down intentionally? Either way, this dish, to me, was like a thin tomato soup with jack fruit. Not worth the $$.

4. Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip)- is described as being the least spicy, and it's true. No spice as all. It is, however, a nice dip for the veggies, but it is way too much ($10.95) for what is basically a side dish. 

5. Drunken Noodle Prawns- the famous deep fried prawns with drunken noodles. Yes, they are good, but not amazingly good. Definitely crunchy, juicy and flavorful, but I've had much better fried prawns at other restaurants, and definitely cheaper. There were probably three prawns in the dish and about 6 pieces of just the shell. And $25.95 for essentially three prawns is a rip off. Also-- there was probably two drunken noodles on the plate. 

6. Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab- More drunken noodles than crab. However, if you like your noodles very slippery and gummy, get the drunken noodles. This was the spiciest of our dishes and to me the tastiest. They cooked the crabs well, but no claw meat- mostly the smaller legs. I've had soft shell crab at other restaurants in LA that was much more generous with their crab. 

Overall, the food was OK, but I can't justify waiting for hours to eat here. The portion sizes are small. No, I'm not talking small compared to American sized portions-- they are small compared to what I had in Northern Thailand. You can get much better food at other restaurants with less of a wait and for less $$. Don't buy into the hype!"}
{"text":"In my humble foodie opinion, Lotus of Siam has the best Thai food in Vegas and possible in the country (based on their food on the menu, not lunch buffet). How did I reach this conclusion? 

- Well let's start with the food itself. The food is phenomenon. I have eaten Thai food in so many places and food at LoS is so much better in term of taste,  flavors, spices, and quality. When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones/meat  being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness. They seasoned the food so nicely that your tongue can taste the sourness, sweetness, spiciness and all other flavors at the same time without one overtaking others. The quality is always so fresh.  Food cooked here are truly being made with care and fitted for royalty. 

- This restaurant used to be hole in the wall kind of restaurant but since expanded out and lookw much nicer inside. This restaurant is also located in a kinda shading commercial center that you normally would not visit if you're familiar with that area. But guess what?  This restaurant is packed every night and you wouldn't believe how many people took taxi and limousines all the way from the strip to dine at this place. There is usually a line waiting outside even before the restaurant is opened for dinner. If you plan to come late, I recommend getting a reservation ahead of time.

- The chef, Saipin Chutima, has won so many awards and is considered one of the best chefs in the country. The restaurant is Zagat rated and so many celebrities and famous chefs dined at this place.

In term of price, I think they are very reasonable for the quality of food you get here. At least here, you truly get what you pay for, unlike some other crappy places in the strip that charge you an arm and a leg for crappy food. 

Don't believe me? Go try their dinner menu and you can see/taste for yourself."}
{"text":"It is always full of people and the service is still quite fast; but, that's not the selling point of this restaurant anyway. Best food selection and overall taste in Vegas that I have tried so far. Price can be high depends on the items, but you can only get those items here and they are done right."}
{"text":"Love love love thIs place. Every time I come to Vegas, I always make time to eat here (we missed it last Christmas trip because they were closed). If you come here, do not order regular food that typically served anywhere else. (Like the boring Pad Thai). Order their specialties. Period.
All the Northern thai food are excellent and very authentic. The Tam Ka noon (I might spelled it wrong) was my favorite, along with everything else. Very flavorful and has a certain aroma of the Northern Thai cuisine which I missed.  Reminds me of my grandma'a cooking. 
I don't get the people that said the food portion is small and expensive. What are you comparing with??? They use really good quality ingredients and some herbs and seasonings have to be imported. I think you get what you pay for. To me, it's worth it. We paid $340 (with tips) for a party of 6, we ordered 14 specialty dishes. 
I can't wait to come back again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow! 
I'm blown away by how great the food and service was ! I am deadly allergic to peanuts and it was nice that they even made our food with vegetable oil instead of peanut oil ! This place is a must go ! Service and food was on point and I'm definitely coming back :))"}
{"text":"Had so much fun at Lotus of Siam - a unique experience when compared to the celeb-chef loaded, overpriced spots on the strip that's definitely worth the cab ride out.

It's low-key, no need to get dressed up, and they're dead serious about reservations - will only hold your table for 5 minutes. Obviously, they're masters of tom yum soup - and any other variety.  I ordered mine mild, because I'm a baby, and they obliged - but one of my companions ordered \"insane spicy\" and they certainly did that too - he was in a lot of pain.  The crispy rice with pork and scallions absolutely rocks - one of my favorite thai dishes I've ever tried.  Broad drunken noodles, red curry, and a whole fish rounded out the meal.  Such a fun experience, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm watching Top Chef Masters in Las Vegas, and all the masters are treated to a dinner at Lotus of Siam for a \"lesson\" in authentic Thai cooking.  It's very clear that all these chefs are blown away by every dish at the table, so before the show was even over I was bookmarking Lotus of Siam on yelp for a future trip.  It helped even more, when I booked a Vegas trip with a friend and the first thing out of his mouth was, \"We must eat at Lotus of Siam.\"

My advice is to explore the menu in advance, there are so many wonderful sounding dishes, that you can be overwhelmed if you wait until you sit down.  So get a game plan in order because there are 167 dishes on the menu.  We heard the Northern Thai dishes are very special here and you don't get them in most Thai restaurants in the US.  First up was the Sai Oua - Northern Sausage.  This was a pork sausage with some kick to it.  I liked pairing it with some of the crunchy veggies on the plate for some contrast and it also mellowed out the spice a bit.  We were going to compare this with an order of the Issan Sausage, but our waiter told us not to bother, since it would be no contest. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#rJOafb9EviIxvHmuRImkTA

Nam Prik Ong was featured once on \"The best thing I ever ate\".  So you know I had to try it.  It's a very tasty Northern ground pork based red chili tomato sauce dip and not very spicy, but packed full of flavor.  It's served with all kinds of crunchy veggies to spread on as well as a few pork rinds.  I will most likely order this every time I go back.  Works well as an appetizer and unique to this restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#w0R40SdZ1M2T6vi_nL7ioQ

A yelper friend of mine, Anita L., bragged about the Nua Nam Tok.  Our waiter warned us that this was a cold dish as some people are surprised.  Well it wasn't actually served cold, but slightly warm at room temperature.  The beef is coated in rice powder which gives it an unusual texture.  The flavor of the sauce was very strong and similar to a Nam Sod, heavy on the lime flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#QwdrDHXlRPQY1CXH6XvNQA

We felt obligated to get a few standard Thai dishes as a place of reference.  Tom Kah  Kai is a soup that most people are very familiar with.  Lotus of Siam's version was very spicy and if you slurp it up the wrong way, it will get your eyes watering.  I love spicy, so no problems with me.  What I liked about this version was that the lemongrass flavor wasn't lost in the coconut milk at all. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#YZAR3oSugi4fd6bammVMzg

My buddy loves Pad Thai (as most people do).  I'm not that fond of the dish, but I will say I'm glad that I got to try it here.  Perhaps I've had so many bad versions of it, that I'm jaded.  This was by far the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.  I would order it again in a second.  We had it with Chicken. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#9UnnMrrfaKk53Uuv-pPyuQ

Last up was a Green Curry with Beef.  I love green curry and I love it spicy.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with a 8.  Lke most things in Vegas; it was fun at the time, but I paid dearly for it the next morning.  It was very spicy and whatever they spiced it up with was green, because other places I've seen all kinds of ground up red chili in there, not in this curry.  Glad I had plenty of rice to soak up this delicious sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#tQBHtC3JR05nKHCMFp-PaA  

Yes Lotus of Siam, should be on your must do list of Vegas.  I would make reservations, as it gets crowded.  We were seated promptly at our 8:30 reservation time on a Friday night.  Others who didn't think ahead had to wait.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside and has most likely expanded a few times, taking over their former next door neighbors.  Taking a large group here would be great as you can sample many dishes, as a true food tourist should."}
{"text":"This place is more like 1.5...slow service .....small portions..expensive...eh taste...whats not to like...haha...what blows me away is the throngs of people who come here and actually wait online outside before they open....and whats with those weird ass hours...This place reminds me of langers neighborhood in los angeles...better come with a shotgun to ward off the baseheads and 5 dollar hookers as you pull into the shopping center.....but if you want to go to a swingers club or a tranny bar your in luck there across the parking lot ...woo hoo !"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful! However this isn't the best kept seceret anymore. hour wait min. so get in early!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Don't let the outside fool you. We had the crispy duck with panang, the baby back rib special and the chicken satay to start wth bananas and coconut ice cream for dinner everything tasted really good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and luckily there was no wait cause it gets busy! Definitely make reservations for dinner! The restaurant is pretty huge and the service can be a bit slow - but the food came out quickly! 

We ordered Thai ice tea - as you would expect but in Mason jars! How fancy of them! We had the softshell crab drunken noodles - yum! Definitely haven't had this with softshell crab. Good flavors - nice amount of softshell crab. But I still love the phad see Eww. Nothing special about this dish but it's as good as it should be! The garlic prawns were definitely super crispy and flavorful! The papaya salad didn't stand out to me - so it might've been my least favorite dish here. The chicken fried rice was good - also nice flavors. And the stand out dish would be the crispy duck panang curry! Omg! Yum! The curry was fantastic and the duck was super tender and fried to a crisp! It was so good! We shared all these dishes family style between a group of 7 - we ordered 2 crispy duck curries and it stuffed us all up for lunch! What a great meal! Would definitely recommend it and come back! 

It's located in a questionable plaza with a ton of other stores and restaurants but lots of parking and worth it!"}
{"text":"Uh. Speechless. Tom Kha was incredible. Panang flavor on point. But-- the mango sticky rice was out of this world. You absolutely cannot go wrong here. Authentic flavors and great price."}
{"text":"Service is not good it was crowded loud few dronk patrons not good atmosphere.I decided to leave and I ate at my hotel room....1/2 hr later I got sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!
Great restaurant! The outside is a little funky and the interior is not fancy at all. However the food is fantastic! Very authentic Thai food. We had spring rolls which were crisp and delicious. Pineapple fried rice and drunken noodles with prawns which was absolutely fantastic! 
Again this is not a high end experience restaurant just a gem off the strip with really good Thai food that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Finally visited this place and am glad I did !!! The expectations were not just met but exceeded. Husband and I went for lunch on a weekday so didn't to have to wait for a table. Our server was very happy to answer all our queries about their incredible wine list or the extensive menu to choose from. We ordered chicken dumplings and northern cousine entrees khao Sui and kang ka noon. Khao sui s a wonderful noodles in a curry dish with beautiful colors n texture. It's definitely going to be a staple for us on our future visits. Kang ka noon was a jackfruit n veggies curry, quite flavorful. We ordered a spice level of 9(indians can eat spicy food :P) which meant all our tastebuds went super active. We did enjoy it but might go for a 7 or a 8 in future. Look forward to explore more of their dishes soon."}
{"text":"I am loving the new location!  I was sad they were closed for a little bit, but it was worth it for the new location.  Service and food is the same as before or even better.  This is about the only Thai place that accommodate food allergy customers, I'm very thankful.

My husband went to the friends and family opening when I was out of town.  He told me the place looked stunning than before.  I came here with him and our friends.  Our friend's wife has never been to Lotus of Siam and she's in the food industry from LA.  She was super satisfy with our lunch.  It was last minute when we came in, good then we got there about 45 minutes before they closing midday.  I would always suggest to make a reservation ahead of time.  Can't wait to come back again!

I'd been hearing rumors about they're opening another location in the Southwest in The Bend(The Curve).  I hope this is true, it's about 2 miles from our place.  =D"}
{"text":"Love this place.  From my food allergy with tree nuts, peanuts, and soy, the servers were very helpful to accommodate me.  I'm very thankful for that.  They do have a large menu.  Lots to choose from, which I think is amazing!

Our group ordered:
Drunken Noodles
Jumbo Prawns
Beef Salad
Papaya Salad (no peanuts, add shrimp)
Sticky Rice with Mango

Everyone we have taken here loves every dish they had.  Left with food coma... hehe"}
{"text":"This is my choice of restaurant food whenever I'm in Vegas. Food is consistently amazing. I'm so glad they move to a new location where the location and ambiance is so much better. I always felt like I had to justify it and making excuses when I tell people that the food is so much more than how the place looks when telling people about the restaurant. The new location finally reflects the quality of the food. Even better, the attentiveness of the staff have improved dramatically. The hostess was very accommodating when I needed to charge my phone. She took it to the back office so it would be safe and charge uninterrupted. My daughter loved the food. As always."}
{"text":"Talk about \"..don't judge a book....\" this discreet location was phenomenal.  A friend had recommended Lotus if I ever made it out to Vegas again.  We happened to be there for a brief 24 hour trip and decided to head over for some thai.  The shopping center looks deserted and there was a 1 hour line out the door, but it was worth the wait.  

We had a wonton wrapped prawn with bacon that was tender and flavorful.  I followed it up with a northern dish called Khao Soi - a red curry dish with egg noodles and sliced chicken.  It had a wonderful amount of heat that was tempered but the sweetness of the coconut cream.  We finished up with the banana and coconut wrapped in wonton.

It was a truly amazing meal that left me happy and not overstuffed.  I would definitely recommend the 10 minute cab ride away from the strip."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Not the best. I've definitely have had better thai food. Overrated and overhyped. I read most of the yelp reviews with 3 or less stars and I agree with them. The portions are a little small.  My pad thai tasted like they burnt something in it which ruined the taste. Same with the moo yang. The yellow curry tasted okay. I did like the bamboo shoots with red curry sauce. Service was pretty good and fast. 

We went at night and there were a bunch of bums walking the parking lot asking for money. Not very comforting. 

Honestly I like komol way better which is just across the parking lot and their menu has pictures. Haha"}
{"text":"Food is always good.... I could've given a 2 star based on the guy that gave us a hard time when we ordered a bottle of wine that was corked - it was a 2005 Dancing Hares. We still ended up ordering another nice bottle -Shafer One Point Five 2013.
We know wines, so we are not paying for a bad bottle especially these are over hundred dollars bottle.
Food wise- the red whole red snapper with chili sauce was good. The snapper was fresh - that was $50. The only thing that I don't recommend is the soft shell crab drunken noodle - it was way too oily and soggy. Shrimp fried rice was ok."}
{"text":"The only thing that Lotus of Siam did wrong was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. What do I mean? Well, it had the misfortune of 1) being the dinner we ate AFTER having gone to Jose Andres' e' and 2) being visited a few months AFTER the wife and I had eaten in Portland's Pok Pok.

If it weren't for those two things, this would've been a five star review all the way. But alas, it wasn't the best meal I'd eaten in 24 hours (though, yes, an unfair comparison) let alone the best Thai I'd had (by which I mean the aforementioned Pok Pok.)

So let me stop the comparisons and just talk about our experience. It's in a strip mall--a sketch strip mall at that. Some (my overly critical parents, for example) might find that a turn off. Others (a-hole Yelpers like me for example) add points given a genuine hole-in-the-wall status. Thankfully, the sketch doesn't extend to the interior.

We had a group of six. We'd made reservations about a month previous so we had few (if any) hiccups (though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time.) The wine list was impressive by hole-in-the-wall Thai joint standards. Actually, it wasn't bad from an objective standpoint either. We'd ordered a few bottles of Reisling, letting the sweetness of the wine counter the spiciness of the food and allowing each diner to bathe in the unfettered air of foodie douchebaggery.

I ordered the BBQ Pork (Moo Yang). It was tasty and I was pretty pleased with it, though it was kind of one-note. Also, it reminded me of the pork I'd eaten at Tu Lan's, a shady Vietnamese place in SF. Now that's not a bad comparison since I LOVED that pork, but I'd expected something a bit more...Thai.

My wife ordered a green curry dish. She said it was \"okay,\" and indeed, my sampling of it concurred. She groused, though. \"From the reputation of this place, I was expecting to be blown away.\" Yeah, I guess so. Then again, some places shine with their unexpected dishes--their specials and such--while phoning it in on the same ol', same ol'. I guess this could be one of those places. In fact, I hope so. It's really hard to tell since the majority of our group went the \"5 different varieties of curry\" route and they too were mildly disappointed.

Sigh.

The service was good and friendly. My pork was tasty. The wine flowed easily. But most of my group were perplexed and questioned the LoS's reputation. I don't know, man. Why didn't you guys order the whole fish if you wanted to see what they can do?

As you can see, I'm a bit torn. I'll give LoS the benefit of the doubt and grant them four stars at least. Hopefully I can return someday and see what they can REALLY do."}
{"text":"Thus is probably the best Thai restaurant I have been to in the USA, and there have been overt a hundred.  A gem in Las Vegas. Don't be fooled by all the others. I will be back."}
{"text":"You know this place is good when the doorman at hotel and taxi driver tell you this place is good.  I mention it to other people visiting Vegas and those who have gone say it is good.  The place is in a dingy strip mall but don't let the looks deceive you. The food is incredibly fresh and extremely tasty with a huge wine list to choose from. The inside decor isn't fancy but who cares when you are having really good food. Be sure to make a reservation as it is hard to get into this place last minute on a busy night."}
{"text":"Lived up to the lofty expectations.  Best Thai food I've ever had, bar none.  Really enjoyed the pork/fried rice appetizer that the waiter recommended (can't remember the name) and also ordered the chicken pad thai, red snapper over drunken noodles, and the crispy duck curry.  All of the dishes were fantastic and unique.  Service was prompt and helpful.  Definitely going to Lotus of Siam on my next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"My latest visit to Lotus of Siam was again a success!  Almost every time I come here, someone I am with wants to order something that I know will not be good.  I usually just smile and say, \"Sure, let's try it\".  I don't want to force my friends to order only what i like, which is why I nod my head and smile, but these dishes remind me each time of why it is so important to order correctly here.  The bad dish this time was the fried dumplings.  Very bland, stuffed with a very small amount of meat, and very average.  

Luckily, they served the Beef Jerky and the dumplings at the same time, so my friend was able to see why i like this place so much.  We got the Beef Jerky, Northern Style Pork Curry, Issan Sausage, Seafood with Drunken Noodle, and Coconut Ice Cream w/ Fried Banana Roll.  Everything was very good.  The sausage was very dry, but had a great fermented flavor, and when combined with the cabbage, fresh chiles, roasted peanuts, ginger, and cilantro, it covers the palate with different flavors that work together perfectly.  

The coconut ice cream was worth writing home about too!  Icy, refreshing, and full of fresh coconut flavor, this was the best way to end the meal since the Sticky rice w/ mango was not available as the mangoes were not in season.  

Once again, Lotus of Siam comes through!"}

I was really looking forward to this place and had high expectations especially when Mr. Gold says this is the \"Best Thai food in North America.\" We came on a Friday around 6:30 and were seated right away without reservations. I was really happy because the last time I tried coming here the place was packed.

After reading some of the review highlights here's what we ordered:

Tom Yum Kai (with coconut milk) - very simple soup with basil, mushrooms and chicken, but the soup was delicious. I can taste the lemongrass and coconut milk and it was just a little spicy.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice) - Very interesting dish, I think it was a little to sour for me and not just from the sausage but it was nice to try something I've never had before.

Beef sautéed in a garlic cilantro pepper sauce, served on bed of green - beef slices were tender and I loved the sauce, this was my favorite dish but I wish they put more beef in it.

Khao Soi (Burmese influence on Northern Thai egg noodle  with beef in a curry sauce and coconut cream) - I love Northern Thai food (Spicy BBQ in LA) and was happy to see a Northern Thai section. The beef was very juicy, a different cut from the garlic beef. This dish was a little more spicy but I loved it. After eating all the noodles we added the rice to mix with the curry sauce. Don't forget to use the limes, it made the dish better. This dish was my 2nd favorite.

Drunken Noodle Seafood - this was ok, they did put in a lot of seafood but it wasn't mind blowing.

Dessert: A sample of Mango Sticky Rice, Fried Banana, and Coconut Ice Cream - I think this was the best sticky rice I've had! The coconut ice cream was very refreshing with small chunks of coconut. The fried bananas were good too, not too sweet.

Including 2 beers and 2 Thai ice teas, tax and tip the bill was slightly over $100, I thought that was pretty pricey for Thai food. Especially when some of the dishes had smaller portions. However service was good and they were very friendly to us. I probably wouldn't have ordered the Drunken Noodles and tried another Northern Thai dish. 

I'd come back if I'm in the mood for Thai food on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"A little over a year ago I watched the Top Chef Masters dine at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas and ever since then this hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant has been on my Yelp bookmark list, just waiting for my next trip to Vegas. Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me.

Located in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America.  We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was \"Lotus of Siam\"...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving!

Lotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more \"peak\" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait.

I had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds.

After the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, sautéed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection.  Delicious!!

Next up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl!

Our last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself!

Last but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and  add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal!

From start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV!"}
{"text":"They are known to be one of the best in town. unfortunately the venue is small so it is better to make a reservation to ensure you can even get in. My favorite is their curry. My party ordered one of every kind and we have all loved it. The wait time can be overwhelming and there is always a wait, so make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"They have spicy but flavorful food. The northern style larb and seafood hot and sour soup are my favorites. I would suggest you make reservations because it is a 45 minute wait easily, and that's on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"M.S.G.  That's right. Their sauces are infused with monosodium glutamate. 
This place is so popular - always crowded,  & today I saw a couple of groups of people being dropped off by taxis. Tourists using Yelp? 
I visited with a girlfriend who is very allergic to MSG; we were seated & she immediately asked if they had it in their food.  The server was sooo sweet & revealed the truth. He even discouraged us from ordering the Thai salad because he said the dressing might have been made with it as well.  
MSG certainly enhances the flavor of food. Could this be part of the reason for its popularity?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never got around to coming here while I lived in Vegas. I've been missing out. 

Here's what we had:

Crispy duck with Penang curry- WOW. This was definitely my favorite. Normally with duck curry I see that the duck is swimming in curry, which leads to soggy skin. Not this dish! The curry was perfectly creamy and spicy, and they place the crispy duck on top so you have crispy skin with every bite. We shared this dish between 4 people, and I think I could have eaten the entire thing myself. I'd say splitting this dish between two people would leave someone hungry if you didn't have other dishes. 

Garlic Shrimp- Now I see why this dish has been mentioned over 200 times! The shell is taken off and fried along with the shrimp meat. So at first I was confused why my shrimp had no meat. The skin was crispy and unlike other places where you struggle to chew it, this version was easy to swallow. The garlic flavor doesn't shine through as much as I'd like, but I would still get this again.

Pad See Ew- Noodles were cooked well and the chicken wasn't dry. It was very good and I would order it again if I was in the mood. Next time I want to try the drunken noodles. I really liked the balance of flavors so I think the other noodle dishes will be good, too.

Service was very friendly. Even though it was busy we had our waters filled and were checked on multiple times. 

The portions are a little on the small side for the price but what you get is pretty amazing. I had a hard time deciding whether I would give this place 4 or 5 stars, and I can't fault them for doing things well and charging more for it. 

Excited for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Big portions, threw in a Thai Iced Tea. Delivery guy was nice. Will be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The most delectible thai food on the planet. That is an understatement.... They have great fried eggrolls, yellow curry, and thai BBQ."}
{"text":"Always an hour or more wait but well worth it food is absolutely delicious in that restaurant is always packed"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I have EVER had to date and I was in a seedy strip mall 2 miles off the Strip in Las Vegas. How that computes? I still don't know, but I don't think I've had better and I live in Southern California, home to some really good Thai places.

Don't let the shady exterior plaza fool you - the inside is nice and when your group is the only Asian table at a Thai restaurant than it has to be good. I'd suggest making a reservation if possible because if you don't, your poor stomach will suffer the same torturous 45 minute wait that I had. 

Notable dishes:
-Pad Thai
-Drunken Seafood Noodles
-Green Curry
-Mango Sticky Rice"}
{"text":"I LOVE THAI FOOD! And when it comes to Lotus of Siam, this is as good as it gets! The location is a little sketchy, but believe me when I tell you this: It's a hidden gem in the cuts of Vegas!

I've been here during my last two Vegas visits and won't ever come to Vegas again without visiting this place!!

Pad Thai
Panang Curry- I got a level 5 spiciness and it was SO good. I love spicy though so maybe get a 3 or 4 if you want mild/medium.
Garlic Prawns
Drunken Noodles
Coconut Icecream
Thai Ice Tea

ALL 100000 STARS :) I'm coming here again in February and I am so excited!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have EVER been to a Thai restaurant as good as this one. It was TOTALLY worth the two hour wait to be seated and the two years it took me to get there. While waiting, many of the regulars (many who come in from out of town) advised us what to order and we looked at the extensive 15 page menu.

Tom Kah Kai soup was exquisite. The first thing that hits you is the great aroma. It had layers of flavors-sweet, salty, with a taste of lime and coconut all with a bit of spice throughout. The white meat chicken was thinly sliced and tender and mushrooms that were firm but not overcooked.

Woon Sen soup (Bankok style) was delicious. The first thing noticed was how it was seasoned with the right amount of salt. The Napa cabbage was cooked perfectly, crunchy but not raw as were the cellophane noodles. The black mushrooms and chicken only enhanced it.

The garlic prawns is one of the most popular items on the menu. Now, I know why. The prawns are deep fried with the shell on and topped with black pepper, having a potato chip texture with a bite. Then, there's the garlic that tasted like it was infused throughout each prawn. This is something that I'd definitely order again.

Crispy duck on drunken noodles was the favorite dish ordered. I was surprised at how crispy the duck actually was, being that it was covered by the sauce of the noodles. The meat itself was moist and flavorful and not greasy like most duck I've ordered from other restaurants in the past. It was placed on a bed of flat noodles that was swimming and over saturated in a sauce, hence the name drunken. The sauce was salty with a sweet and sour aspect in it and a mild spiciness.

Lotus of Siam has won award after award every year since 2008 and it's an experience that shouldn't be missed if you are anywhere near Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was very impressed to see the chef of a Thai restaurant get accolades from James Beard, but once I tasted their food (and saw the wine list) it all started to make sense. Enjoy the authentic Northern Thai cuisine or play it \"safe\" with a curry, but this food is on the nose for taste and quality. I ordered Jackfruit curry which had the most pleasant homemade spicy heat I've ever enjoyed. This is probably the best way you can spend $10 on food in all of Vegas."}
{"text":"Larb siem is to dye for. Food was very good. I also like that it's in a strip mall so there is no need to worry about parking. It's definitely pricy but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I'd give the food four stars but the service was very spotty. Drinks arrived too late, there was confusion over who ordered what, and they said they'd split the check for our party (we asked upfront) but then they didn't at the end. They removed the water bottles after we paid the check but before we were standing up to leave, without asking us.

The quality of the food was good overall, but it seems that the spiciness levels everyone picked weren't honored correctly (a \"4\" for one dish was way hotter than a \"6\" for another dish and so on)."}
{"text":"Five stars for food, no question. I've eaten here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed... I'm only knocking off a star because I've not always received great customer service. Before you go, you should know, this place gets BUSY... There's a good chance you'll wait an hour or more, even on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"+ yes it is pretty tasty
+servers are friendly and attentive
+im pretty sensitive to MSG but I felt okay after eating here.
-----
- it is expensive. 

Portions are ok but expect high end pricing for 8/10 food. 
Nothing was to die for imo. 
President's thai in east pasadena is more flavorful and cost 50% less. 

They have a lot of wines... in house cellar maybe?

Parking is big. You have to go in  and park in the back where there is front door to the restaurant.  It appears to be a little run down outside. 

Went here after seminar... people at the seminar recommended.  

Ill try something else next time."}
{"text":"Man I am going to die dreaming about the crispy duck with coconut curry sauce. If only I could rest on a bed of duck in a sea of coconut curry...

Ordered:
-Crispy duck with coconut curry
-Garlic Prawns 
-Coconut Ice cream
-Fried Rice
-Pad Thai
-Green Curry

The crispy duck is a huge filet of duck floured and deep fried then cut into slices and drenched in a creamy and spicy coconut curry sauce. The skin is still incredibly crispy and the fattiness cuts out the spiciness of the curry very well.  MUST GET.

The garlic prawns: basically tiger prawns half de-shelled so that their bodies are chilling outside of the shell but still wearing them like a cape. Then they are deep fried and tossed in garlic and white pepper. The shell was the best part! So crispy, salty, slightly spicy, and not the least bit oily. It was just endless crunchfuls of deliciousness. MUST GET. These fried shells are better than chips. Better than fried pork skins. Better than any crunchy savory combo item you can ever dream of. GET THESE. They are expensive.

The coconut ice cream was very interesting. Order it. Creamy yet refreshing, it had a flavor almost similar to taro.

Other stuff were whatever. The portions here are small. Be prepared to spend more here than at your regular Thai restaurant.

Also, we tried to get a thai ice tea to go and the waiter told us they were out of to-go cups... while standing in front of a huge unopened bag of plastic cups......"}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Lotus of Siam while we were visiting Las Vegas, and overall, I thought that it was inventive Thai food, but it was overhyped. 

I did not handle the reservation, but I was told that it was difficult to get. Basically everybody in Las Vegas knows about this restaurant, from the TSA agent to people working at the hotel pool. The new location is rather large.

We had a 8:30 reservation for Saturday night and apparently that is one of the last seatings, because only one other table after us was sat. The restaurant slowly cleared out once we got there, but it was packed when we first arrived.

The menu is huge and overwhelming, which is not great. I would prefer a restaurant just specialize in a few choices as opposed to literally anything that is made in Thailand or Burma.

We asked for waiter for recommendations, and he was knowledgeable about the dishes. He recommended a green salsa, which was too spicy and over done. (The presentation was nice though.) The softshell crab was the best dish in my opinion, and they source it from Mexico. I did ask where their shrimp was from, considering all the human rights abuses with Thailand shrimp, but they also come from Mexico. 

Rather abruptly before any food arrived, he informed us rather urgently that the kitchen was closing and that we should put in any orders for food now. I felt kind of rushed, and because of all the hype I wanted to try more food but I didn't know what I already ordered. That caused us to over order - at 9 PM on a Saturday night. Way too much food because you can't tell dish size when you order.

Overall, the food was above average for Thai food, but there are two Thai restaurants back home in Washington DC alone that I would go to before this one. It didn't match the hype."}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever. 
Very busy. Showed up on a Thursday night right before it closes. Still have to wait for 15 min."}
{"text":"The place was great but only bad thing was the tables are too closed together and one of the waiters got our order mixed and my was wrong. It was a bit noisy in there so you can't really hear the conversation you are having with your friends unless you are yelling or have a loud voice. 

At least the food was still great. My bf calls it a cafeteria. I would still go back even if it is a little far from me."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Best Thai I've ever had, great use of spices and never too spicy.  Every dish was on point÷"}
{"text":"Smilecare Dental, Henderson, NV

Been a patient for years, good service on the Staffs Part, but today on my 6 month check-up and Cleaning I ended up waiting for one full hour of listening to the Dentist Talk to one of his buddies in the next room about GOLF!!!  I finally got up and left.  Guess he couldn't be bothered to go over my x-rays and let me know if I needed anything.

I need to find a dentist that actually gives a crap about his patents Teeth, right???"}
{"text":"Delicious. Just what I needed to offset a yardstick! 

Had the Chicken Pad Thai (spicy level 7/10) and the Thai BBQ chicken.

Pad Thai was spicy! Just the way I like it. The noodles were nice and chewy, it came with the right amount of sprouts and other veggies to give it an interesting texture, and there was a good amount of chicken. Also had crushed peanuts on the side, which is a minor detail that I find lacking in some places. 

Thai BBQ chicken was delicious, it came with rice and a sweet-and-spicy sauce that I could honestly eat all day. The chicken was cooked nicely, it was tender and savory. 

Pretty conveniently located, it's about a 10 minute drive from Caesar's palace, where we stayed. I would recommend it heartily for anybody looking for drunchies :D

One note, make sure to get a reservation! We had one for 8:00 and we got there at 8:06, and they had given our table away already. If you don't have a reservation I think the wait is something like 40-60 minutes."}
{"text":"So overrated. Just because Anthony Bourdain liked this place,  doesn't mean the food is the best in the world. So expensive for thai dishes which were unremarkable and bland. The portions are small.  And the prices are big.  The only dish that was worth remembering was their popular egg noodles tossed in curry.  It was different, hence why I still remember it.  Other than that, everything else was unmemorable. I feel like this place is a tourist trap...and we definitely took the bait on this one :/"}
{"text":"\"The Single Best Thai Restaurant in North America'--not my words, Jonathan Gold's. But as the resident LA critic extraordinaire, Gold's recommendation certainly warranted an investigation. So on my post-new year's trip to Vegas, I convinced my friends to go Lotus of Siam. I can't say if S. Irene Virbila's claim \"that there's nothing as good--or lip-numbingly hot in LA\" is true since I haven't properly explored Thai Town in North Hollywood, but I can say that Lotus of Siam can be worth the trip.

Now when I say that Lotus of Siam is worth a trip, I didn't necessarily mean a drive from Los Angeles. It's certainly worth a dinner from anywhere on the Strip (being about 3 miles off-Strip). But I wouldn't leave California for this food with the diverse Thai options here in town. Still, I wouldn't consider a foodie's visit to Vegas without a meal at \"the best Thai restaurant in North America.\""}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant that I've experienced. Because of this it is a famous \"must visit\" dining destination for Las Vegas visitors. When I have business in Vegas, I always plan an outing to Lotus of Siam. 
Don't come here and order typical Thai dishes like Pad Thai, Panang and Drunken Noodles unless you jazz it up with something like crispy duck. Order from the Northern Specialties since that is the most special part of their menu and arguably what they are best at.
Khao Soi, another comfort food dish with noodles and meat in a panang curry like soup with pickled vegetables and raw red onions is delicious and a go-to dish for me.
Nam Kao Tod (a puffed crispy rice salad with preserved sour pork sausage) has volumes of flavor (spicy, sour, minty) if you're looking for something different.
Try Nam Prik (a composed room temperature chili based salad),  Jackfruit salad, Hung Lay (pork curry braised down with garlic and ginger), Northern Larb (their version of comfort food).

The garlic prawns are a crowd pleaser and a safe choice for non-adventurous diners. The Drunken Noodles with crispy duck is another crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. I would never have known it was here if my husband hadn't heard about it from one of his fellow actors. It's a hidden gem. DH ordered the pork Moo Yang, I had crispy duck Panang (spice level 7). We got the tempura as an appetizer.

The service is incredible. They work as a team, rather than assigning a particular waiter to a table. This means your needs are always met without waiting, and quickly.

The wine was overpriced and only meh.

The food, however - OMG. After my first bite of the duck, I needed a towel and a cigarette. Really good. It was perfect crispy, not too fatty, and spiced just right."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks like a whole in the wall. You would have no idea that once you walk in, you are almost transported to a whole new world: a beautiful, huge, amazing restaurant with delicious food and tons of customers. Very surprising! I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This review is for Pristine Cleaning.  Excellent job done by Rosio and Jocelyn. They really did a Pristine job. I am totally impressed. They arrived right on time and were done in the timeframe they told me they would.  They were very pleasant and hard workers. I am definitely going to rebook to have a time every 3 weeks to have them clean my house.  You won't be disappointed with this company.  5 Star service Definately."}
{"text":"Place is INCREDIBLE, there's not a better restaurant in the country in terms of taste and value.  If you love Thai, this is your #1.  

The dumpy strip mall location is pretty incongruent with how great this place is, plus you usually wade through 2-3 guys in the parking lot wanting to \"wash\" your car.  In a strange way, once you start making regular trips this becomes part of it's charm.

Get a reservation, bring a group, and go to town on this amazing menu.  Don't leave without trying some of these:

Chicken fried rice
Nam kao tod (strange, delicious sausage)
Any of the soups
Any of the curries 
Drunken noodle - sea bass or chicken
Papaya salad (go MILD or they'll be laughing at you in the kitchen from your pain)
Braised short rib with noodle

Great selection of wine and thai beer.  

I usually go at least twice when in Vegas.  If you're lucky you'll be waited on by the guy who refuses to write down your order no matter how larger or how complicated it is.  Think he's a blackjack pro, too."}
{"text":"Nice interior décor. Good flavors but portions are small; lots of menu choices with dishes from different regions of Thailand.  Friendly service and you can request various level of spiciness to suit your palates."}
{"text":"I can say this could be one of the BEST Thai Restaurant outside of Thailand, or Thai Town, Hollywood. The only complaint I have is the papaya salad could be more authentic with ingredients such as Thai green beans, salty crab, dried shrimp and more spices. 

But I will definitely come back with friends to try the many dishes they have on their menu."}
{"text":"Damn Lotus of Siam, why is your food so damn expensive for these itty bitty portions!  When you think of Thai food, you think sweet, sour, spicy, and decent portions!  This place is definitely over-hyped and overrated.  

The wait is long, but I'm sure most people already know and are prepared for that (The wait time for my large party was 2 hours.).  The dishes I admit are delicious, however I left very unsatisfied and still hungry. 

Garlic Prawns - These were quite delicious.  I hate that there are pieces that are empty.  Worth a try but not worth eating more than once, very simple dish that you can probably make yourself with a deep fryer.

Papaya Salad - Nothing special here, don't get me wrong it is good (you can't really mess up with papaya salad).  Again such a small portion, what are they expecting to feed, a baby rabbit??

Pad Thai - Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.

Soft Shelled Crab Drunken Noodle - The soft shelled crap was crispy, and alright.  This was okay for me, it was quite salty but the blandness of the greens evened it out.

Sweet Coconut Rice, Fried Bananas - I enjoyed this very much however, again overpriced for something that tastes the same almost everywhere else.

Tom Kah Kai Hotpot - The soup was delicious, however the chicken was like rubber!

Honestly after my group finished our dinner, we were hella confused because all of the other good reviews.  We are from Cali and there are Thai restaurants everywhere, for the amount of our bill, we could have had good Thai food for a week!  Don't feed into the hype people, I'm sorry Lotus of Siam, you disappoint and probably are popular because all these people are being suckered by the other hyped reviews (a sad cycle)."}
{"text":"Best Thai food! The dishes are very authentic! We take a taxi there every time we come to Vegas!

Must try the nam Kao tod, and mango salad! It really says something when there are droves of taxi cabs dropping people off at the front door. 

The mango sweet rice dessert is really the best."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Las Vegas for a reason. I remember the place before they got the second room.
This is the best thai restaurant I've ever been too, and the menu is so deep.  It is amazing.  Everything from the drunken noodles to the northern dishes have been awesome.  I especially recommend the northern dishes as they're not something you'll get elsewhere, and they're delicious.  This is the place to be adventurous!
The wine list is excellent.
Get reservations on weekends."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure to dine here several times in the last few years. Lotus has one of the best wine lists of any restaurant in the country. I am basing this observation based on how well the wines selected pair with their food and the buyer no doubt knows a lot about the best producers in Germany and France. I was floored to see several bottling's of AJ Adam on any one restaurants list. He is quite possibly the finest producer in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer. Please do not drink them all before my next trip to Vegas!!
Maybe I should talk about food now....
The deep fried pompano fish with ginger and black mushroom sauce will make all the blood in your veins rush to a certain area of your anatomy with a different name depending on your gender. There are too many things on the menu to list but very hard to find one that is not mind blowing. Thank you LoS for providing such a great experience on the highway of life."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical leaving The Strip and coming to a deserted parking lot at about 9:00 pm.  I was blown away by the groups of people waiting by the entrance door of the restaurant.  We made out way past the people and found even more inside the waiting area.  We managed to put our names down on the wait list, and the hostess said it would be a thirty minute wait.  We decided we would leave, explore outside, and then come back later.  

Don't judge us for what we decided to do next.  Just a few steps away was a massage parlor.  The GF and I decided to treat ourselves with a thirty minute foot massage.  I wonder if the massage place gives the restaurant a cut of the profits, since I can imagine a lot of the customers also eat there.  The massage was not that great, but that is another review for a different day.  

We came back to the restaurant seven minutes after they had called, informing us that our table was ready.  We were seated fairly close to the entrance, next to a secluded room.  The interior of the dining establishment looked quite remarkable.  Everything looked new, and well maintained.  The exterior was very  misleading.  You would never expect to see such grand chandeliers, a vast wine selection, and well kept furniture.  

We decided to order the fried wontons to start, thai fried rice and khao soi for our main course, and for dessert, we had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  The fried wontons were just okay tasting.  I enjoyed their homemade sweet and sour sauce.  As for the wonton , they were a tad overcooked, causing them to dry out. The skin to meat ratio was disproportionate. This was the only item that I felt was not worth the price.  

We ordered the thai fried rice without tomatoes, and with a fried egg on top.  Our server even repeated all the items we ordered back to us.  Somewhere along the way, this was not communicated to the kitchen.  Not surprisingly, there were tomatoes everywhere!  So, we sent it back, and hopefully there was no spit in the new one we received.  I am almost positive they used the same egg from our old one because it was only room temperature.  Overall, the thai fried rice was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly.  With the slide of the knife, the yolk oozed everywhere.  

The khao soi was definitely the star of our meal.  Be warned that a 6 is super spicy.  You get to choose the spiciness level from 1-10.  It was so good though.  The curry broth had so much explosive flavor.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, and all the ingredients inside the bowl complimented each other perfectly.  My favorite part of the dish was the coconut curry, hands down.  

For dessert, there are three options.  They are ice cream, fried bananas, and mango sticky rice.  We decided to get the ice cream AND fried bananas, which are two desserts.  I have to admit, I have not ever seen fried bananas served without ice cream.  It was surprising that people order it by itself.  When it finally arrived, we were already so full.  I wish there was more ice cream to go with the bananas.  We finished the ice cream with about four more banana pieces left.  

Overall, a very good dining experience.  It was quite nice to get away from The Strip.  Out of the less than ten times I have been to Vegas, this was my first time eating outside  casinos and away from the gambling addicts.  It was a pleasant experience, and I can see why this place is doing so well."}
{"text":"Can't disagree with the critics, it is the best Thai restaurant in the country. If you don't eat here you are missing out."}
{"text":"My visit to Lotus of Siam last night was great, so I'm upping my stars to 4. Other than the hefty price tag for tiny portions, this place ROCKS.  Last night we went with a group of 8 and the service was just as great as my first visit. My boyfriend and I shared the crispy duck with drunken noodles and also the beef larb. Both dishes were just amazing and cooked to perfection. However, last time I ordered spiciness with a 3 and it was a tad bit too spicy, so this time I ordered with a 2 and there was no spice at all, lol. I think it's just a Thai thing and it depends on who's cooking that day. Either way, the food was excellent!"}

Get there early or you will have to wait a long time to get a table!

Mango Sticky Rice is our absolute favorite!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've ever had!  The place is in a strip mall, very nondescript, but the line of cabs outside shows you made it to the right restaurant.  The place was very full on a Monday night, but we got in and out of there quickly to make our show.  Service very friendly and efficient.  We got the pad thai, which was the best ever!  Usually the noodles taste bland, but these had a real tasty flavor.  We also had a curry pork which was also very good.  Other Thai restaurants could learn from Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVERS EVER.  This lady had 0 personality and to ask her a question it looks like she could not be bothered very very annoying. Onto the food now ! you lost a start for your lousy service. Started out with the shrimp salad excellent shrimp cooked to perfection in an amazing mint sauce. I also got the green papaya salad was good. for my entree i got the drunken noodles with shrimp. The noodles were defintely fresh made in house.  They were stir fried not deep fried. My dish came out luke warm to the point I could not enjoy it I sent it back and it came back steaming hot. Much better we waited 50 minutes for our lunch after our appetizers were served, Also got the garlic fried shrimp everyone raved about was very good hardly and oil the way it was cooked was perfect. this place is far off the strip. I definitely would go back the next time i returned though. Hopefully I will get a different waitress !!"}
{"text":"Writing a review so I'll remember to come back here the next time I'm in town. I heard a lot before we went and I was not disappointed! Location is 
definitely unexpected, but that just made the meal more fun. 

Pluses:

+Outstanding service
+Incredible wine list
+Super prompt kitchen
+Did I mention? Incredible food, bursting with flavor. 

Minuses:

-Very over-stuffed belly post-meal."}
{"text":"Had to make a pit stop here after hearing all the great things about this Thai restaurant! There weren't any reservations available for a table of 5 on a Monday, so we waited in line about 15 min before opening. There was already 1 party waiting ahead of us. After opening, we were greeted kindly by a hostess and she took our name down for a table. We waited in a nice waiting area by the bar. We only had to wait about 5-10 min before being seated. We ordered a couple appetizers, noodle dishes, panang duck, and garlic prawns. Everything was good, but what stood out were the garlic prawns!! Service was good as well. Glad we went before opening as the entire restaurant was filled pretty quickly after opening. Also, note that this is a new location, so be aware of that if you uber here! Uber might pull up the old location. We almost went to the old address by accident, oops."}
{"text":"This is one of my best meals in Vegas! I have never experienced real Thai food until now. Normally I would have settled for the usual pad thai and pad see ew. However, I wanted to be adventurous this time. I tried the nam kao tod as an appetizer, and it was AMAZING - the crispy rice with the pork sausages, lime juice, chili, and green onions make my mouth water. Hands down, the best Thai dish ever!!! I even looked up recipes online to try to replicate this dish at home. 

We also tried the garlic prawns that were deep fried; the dish was deliciously crunchy. Our third dish was the crispy duck in Khao Soi (thai egg noodles in a curry sauce). The crispy duck was yummy, but got a little soggy in the Khao Soi. It would have been slightly better if the crispy duck was separated from the Khao Soi, and combined the two later to maintain the crispness in the duck. 

The menu is quite extensive. My boyfriend and I were quite overwhelmed. We could only fit in three dishes between the two of us. I would highly recommend this place. You'd be really missing out if you don't give it a shot! 

Service was friendly and fast. 

There is plenty of parking in the plaza."}
{"text":"This a Vegas must go. Every time we come to Vegas, we come here. 

Make reservations! Or else you will be waiting forever. 

The location is sketchy but the food is good. 

Highlights: 
-Thai Iced Tea
-Garlic Prawns
-Nua Katiem (Beef with garlic... Sounds so simple but so amazing) 
-Raw Prawns (not for the faint hearted. This is raw shrimp but sauce) it's so good 
-Crispy Catfish Salad. Sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"The crispy duck is killer good. The rest of the items are typical. You can find similar in LA (We are very lucky and have great Thai places in LA). The duck is a must try but $25 is a little pricy."}
{"text":"I guess if you are into Northern Thai cuisine and have a taste for that particular type of Thai, it must be the bomb, but there are two dozen Thai restaurants in Las Vegas that outdo this overrated restaurant time and time again."}
{"text":"I have had so many people tell me about this place and finally convinced someone to go with me! There were so many options to choose from the menu seemed overwhelming at first - but the food was sooooo good! I will definitely be back for awesome Thai food since I played it safe by just ordering Pad Thai. Also was surprised at how big it was once I walked in - who knew? Totally a hidden gem in Vegas and deserving of all the exposure it's gotten in media and from my peers!"}
{"text":"I heard that this place was regarded as the best Thai restaurant in the US, so my expectations were set high. Fortunately, expectations were met. Everything we ordered was delicious and the servers kept my water glass full. Probably the best water service I've experienced. LOL. The only down side is that the cost is a tad bit more than I'm used to paying for Thai food. We ordered 6 dishes and the total came out to $150 (tax and tip included.) But that definitely wouldn't deter me from going back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Too bad I don't live in Vegas to eat here more often!
I've been here a couple of times and it has been consistently good.
I followed the advice of fellow Yelpers and ordered the following:
Crispy duck panang curry - it was so good, we ordered a second serving. Need more curry sauce in this dish!
Garlic prawns - I don't taste the garlic, but it's very crispy, you can even eat the skins, crunchy!
The above are the exceptional dishes.  The other dishes we had were good, but not wow: green curry, drunken noodle with softshell crab and one of the Northern Thai dish (probably just because I'm not used to the dish).

While the space is bigger than it seems from the outside, there are lots of people vying to get in.  So be prepared to wait, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"With a group of 10 we were able to order more than enough food to sample. 

Issan cooking is my favorite type of Thai fare and the dishes we ordered proved that the northern style dishes clearly won over the more traditionally Thai ones.

I've eaten Thai for decades now, in Thailand, in various countries in Asia, in north America and Australia. I can honestly say, this is THE best Thai meal I've had, hands down, outside of Thailand.

We had a huge array of dishes and my favorites were:

Issan sausage -- these had great texture and the sauce wasn't overly sweet

Pad Kee Mow -- the best I've ever had! the perfect amount of greasiness and spiciness. The noodles were slippery just the way they're supposed to be

Chili and Mint Duck -- this surprised all of us. The portion was small but the crispy rice on the bottom was enough to send us off the edge -- it was THAT good

Nuer Nam Tok -- a version of grilled beef but with toasted rice sprinkled all over giving the sauce a thick consistency which clung to the meat. Absolutely divine.

I'm trying to gather a group to go to Vegas just to visit Lotus of Siam. It is so good I'm craving it right this moment!"}
{"text":"Larb- not the best i've ever had, but good.  we ordered 10/10 spicy on this one and it was hotttt!!
Rice ball salad- delicious.  thanks to the other reviewers that recommended it.
Sea Bass drunken noodles- also delicious.  seriously delicious.  expensive.
Pumpkin pork curry- good.

The above dishes plus three beers = $100+.  Expensive, but I was visiting Vegas... Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Doesnt have an authentic Thai flavor to it. Seems like they dont take a lot of time making a \"Great\" Thai dish. More of a bottom of the barrel 2 star just serve them quickly type of thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Dear everybody who visits, lives in or wants to go to Las Vegas anytime soon:

There is a whole city off the strip! Most of it is \"blah\", but this little gem on East Sahara is better than most of those fancy, overrated celebrity chef restaurants in the major hotels.

EVERYTHING IS GOOD. Their most popular dishes are spectacular. They also have a cheap lunch buffet with Pad Thai, a curry, a few other dishes and one of my favorite dishes there, the Garlic Wings. The Garlic wings are amazing...dry (no sauce) and little dry garlic chips all over - sooo good!!!

I try to go whenever I'm in Vegas for work, and the place is always filled with business men and women having lunch meetings and tourists rolling in via taxis and rental cars.

I am not much of a wine connoisseur, but apparently this place has a legendery wine list as well - I've seen wine distributers there on many occasions."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend between classes and first impression is that I didn't expect to see what was inside. From the outside the business doesn't look too impressive but in the inside it is very spacious, modern looking and was pretty crowded during lunch time.

I decided to have the buffet which was $10.99. A little pricey but had to try it out. I would have to say that all the dishes at the buffet were good but not great. I tried the Pad Thai, fried rice, fried banana, chicken curry (Good but a little spicey) and egg rolls.

Overall, like I said the food was good but not the best I ever had. Con was that there was not much variety but was satisfactory. Next time I will be sure to try the entrees."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had. And upscale."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining here.  The food and service were great.  Some of the best Thai food I have eaten."}
{"text":"Just dined there and can only say they now have \"open air\" dining throughout the restaurant.

Just don't go when its raining outside!"}
{"text":"Wow, new location is stellar, try the Duck and drunken noodles! The stuffed chick wings (I know it sounds weird) is really good as well."}
{"text":"True to many previous reviews, this restaurant has the best Thai food I have ever had.  We ordered the crispy beef, roasted duck curry and drunken noodles, and all were excellent.  We are a sucker for authentic food and this was above and beyond - not only was it authentic, but very tasteful and highly \"gourmet\""}
{"text":"What a meal, can't believe it took me this long to try Lotus of Siam.  I lived in Vegas 9 years and somehow never made it to Lotus of Siam.  Back a visitor I ate dinner here, and am very glad I did.

We had reservations at Lotus on a Thursday at 8:00 pm.  As many Yelpers note, it's in a non-descript shopping center on East Sahara.  When we opened the door the place was jumping.  It's large, with seating throughout the restaurant.  Despite the crowd we were seated immediately, even a couple of minutes before our reservation.  A man who wasn't our server but we saw several times during the evening took our drink order.  He brought us our water as well as a bottle of wine.  The Lotus wine list isn't enormous, but it's diverse enough for the majority of wine drinkers.  There are a few options by the glass and very reasonably priced bottles.  I think I've become jaded by Strip pricing when it comes to wines by the bottle.  But, there aren't any unknown gems or incredible wines on the list, but you will likely find something you like for far less than you'd pay elsewhere.

The menu was overwhelming to us.  Daunting, even.  So, we asked our server what dishes he recommended we try on our first visit.  For appetizers, we had the crispy rice and crispy garlic black pepper chicken wings.  For the spice level on the rice, we requested a 6/10.  When the dish arrived and we tried it, it was incredibly hot.  We should have calibrated our request for Thai cuisine, we were expecting a different level of heat to say the least.  But, the dish was fantastic, very crispy and flavorful with the cubes of sausage and green onions.  I'd order this dish again at a 6/10, I would just prepare myself for the heat.  The garlic pepper wings were pretty standard, very crispy skin and flavorful.  But, the appetizer winner for me was the crispy rice.

For dinner, we split:  the drunken noodle sea bass, garlic prawns, crispy duck with curry cause, and a beef dish that I can't remember the name.  It had a bunch of veggies and a spicy sauce, I know that.  My favorites were, in order:  the duck, the sea bass, the prawns, the beef.  The crispy duck was tender with a very crispy skin, impressive given it was coated in sauce.  The sauce, by the way, was probably the best curry I've had.  I could come to Lotus and only get this dish and leave happy.

The sea bass had flavorful noodles along with a tender and flaky sea bass.  Excellent fish.  The fried prawns were very crispy and the garlic sauce is fantastic.  i could have used more of it.  The beef was good, but it paled in comparison to the other dishes.  

For dessert, we tried fried bananas, which were good, but not very sweet.  But, I didn't come to Lotus for the dessert, so it wasn't a huge deal that I didn't love it.

Be advised that the dishes come out very fast.  It won't take you long to have a meal.  Very glad I finally tried this Las Vegas institution and will likely be back on future trips.  Its lofty reputation is well-deserved."}
{"text":"heard lots of hype about this place so i checked it out. the food is ok. but i expected more from a $300+ bill for 4 people.  lobster, shrimp, sticky rice, soups. average thai food. for the same money, there are better restaurant choices in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, great service friendly atmosphere.  I was so excited to try this place on my last visit home.  I have heard about it so many times and can't believe I never tried it sooner (like when I lived in Vegas), however I finally got my family (boring eaters) to finally go!

First off this place is really crowded we called twice about dinner but were told they were booked and would mostly likely have to wait an hour if we decided that we were going to just show up.  We ended up going for lunch because we figured it would not be as crowded.  It worked but I still suggest calling ahead.

Out of all the thai restaurants I have eaten at Lotus of Siam had the greatest.  They had a large selection of main dishes, soups, and salads.  Most of the dishes could also be made vegetarian.  In addition to standard thai dishes they also offered a selection of Northern Thai food.

I recommend the spicy vegetable soup, basil and chili tofu with mixed vegetables and the panang curry."}
{"text":"My whole family loves Lotus of Siam. Great service. suggestion is get there early if you don't have a reservation or your going to wait in a line that sometimes extends outside."}
{"text":"(Spoiler warning, I may rant like crazy because I love this place)...
I actually met the daughter of the owners and she's been trying to get me to eat here for about a year...  I haven't been able to make it back in town for leisure but I finally ended up back in town for business the week of SEMA 2009 (Nov 1-8).

After a bit of convincing, we took an entire business dinner here with over 20 people.  Even though we were strange foreigners to the area, we all managed to find it in the dark parking lot of horrors that lured us in away from the shiny flashy neon lights of Vegas. Our dinner party consisted of foodies and hungry men from CA, OK, and Taiwan, and China.

The menu had what seems like hundreds of various options that I've never even seen on a Thai menu.  Normally I'd just expect Pad Thai, Rad Naa, Pad See Ew and some seafood fried rice, but the menu here was so vast and covered everything from Chilean Sea Bass, to short ribs, beef salads, curries, rices, fried Prawns and the traditional Pad Thai. The 23 of us managed to order almost 30 dishes and we all had the intention of eating individually but we ended up eating family style because we all reacted with the same \"OMG, you MUST try this, it's too good!\" reactions.

There were soo many dishes ordered that I'm not even going to waste my time trying to list everything out.  Personally, I ordered the Sea Bass w/ Suki sauce and I also managed to try the traditional curries w/ rice, and noodles.  I also bummed someone's beef short ribs and a wonderful sampling of Tom Yum soup.  Seriously, the food was so amazing that we all just shared and the \"business meeting\" ended up turning into a friendly feast.

The experience was so amazing that I brought a 2nd business dinner there two nights later.  The same exact thing happened as the first too! We ened up eating like a hungry family and no one left unhappy.

Seriously, this is beyond me saying \"some of the best Thai food I've ever had\".  It actually is more like \"some of the best food I've ever had PERIOD\".  Not only is the food here so amazing that it's worth sharing, it's brought some of my most memorable and happiest dining experiences as a group.  

I still get calls from the clients in Oklahoma and reps from Taiwan who say they want to go back. 

Yes. It's that darn good.  

Thank you Lotus of Siam (and Penny) for making us fiend real and amazing Thai food.  

I will forever walk singing your praises...

\"It's so yummy, in my tummy, omm nomm nommm nom!\""}
{"text":"At long last, I was finally able to pay a visit to Lotus of Siam after twisting the arms of some friends to go off the strip for a dinner. 

The strip mall in which LoS is located is not easy on the eyes by any stretch, and finding it for the first time may take a great spotter riding shotgun.  However, the inside of the restaurant is nice enough--certainly more so than the outside.

I was most impressed by two of our dishes on the night we went: (1) Tom Yum Kai and (2) Pad Thai. The Tom Yum was, for me, the perfect balance of spicy and sour. Some Tom Yums I've had tend to lean more toward the sweet/sour combo, so I loved LoS' rendition. The broth was pure tasting with the wonderful flavor of lemongrass which was not overpowering. 

For their Pad Thai, LoS uses round noodles, making them different from the flat noodles I've had at every other Thai restaurant I've been to. The sauce for their Pad Thai was otherworldly. 

We also had the mee kraab appetizer, green curry with tofu, and a Northern Thai curry dish with egg noodles and pickled vegetables. The mee kraab was very sweet with a hint of fish sauce, and was enjoyed by all at our table. I particularly loved the green curry, spicy, that was accented with wonderfully-cooked eggplant. And finally, I felt the Northern Thai dish was a bit one-dimensional with a heavy-handed red curry broth. 

LoS met the high expectations I had. When I return, however, I'll be sure to tell them to omit MSG from all my dishes, since they cook with it by default (but our server said they'll gladly leave it out upon request). LoS is a welcome respite from the strip--a very \"normal\" restaurant amidst the glitz and glamor of all that Vegas embodies. However, unlike most of Vegas, the quality of the food far outpaces the price."}
{"text":"You really get your money's worth here. Great place to visit when you're broke from frequenting the $50 buffets on the strip.

Their pad thai is one of the best I've tasted. Our serve told us that they use peanut oil and we've had issues with Asian restaurants that mix their seafood and non-seafood pots and pans. My parents explained all my little brother's food allergies and the guy was really understanding and accommodating. He made sure that the dish we ordered for my brother wasn't deadly :]"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  After ALL the HYPE about this place, my husband found the food a little less than expected.  But the food was authentic, not your typical American Thai menu, yummy, and the service was very good.  We ordered short ribs with egg noodles in red coconut milk curry, a chicken curry dish (\"unique curry\" in a rice powdered red curry base) that was kind of a soup, and the chopped meat dip with raw vegetables that has gotten much press from ming tsai.  Specifically, the names of the dishes: khao soi braised short rib, kang omm, and nam prik ong, My favorite was the Lotus Of Siam special, the kang omm, because the flavor of the broth was so savory, and the vegetables so wonderfully prepared.
The coconut curry dish with short rib, khao soi, was also good, but be ready for a sauce that is sweeter than it is spicy or savory.  
The meat dip thing, nam prik ong, was interesting and is reminicent of a bolognese to my palate, but it is much more subtle to someone with a more discerning palate like my husband.
MAKE RESERVATIONS! Most of the people who came waited on line for upwards of an hour or were turned away altogether.  But we were seated right away because we had reservations.
The waitstaff is very friendly, and they refilled our water right away.  This place needs to move to a better strip mall, or move to the strip altogether, because the area it's in is DEAD, and most of the stores around it are closed or shady."}
{"text":"I'm honestly really really disappointed.

I had the crispy duck over drunken noodles for a whopping NINETEEN DOLLARS. The noodles were all stuck together, tasteless, and covered in oil from the duck. The duck was not really crispy, but just hard and oily from the batter, and had little meat. The sauce, which is usually the redeeming quality, was just bad.

Note: this place is alot further than it looks. It was a 10-15 minute taxi ride from the strip because of the stop lights and such."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on our last day in Vegas. I don't know why we waited so long! The restaurant is located in a sketchy part of town in a strip mall - but don't let that stop you! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The green curry with shrimp is an absolute must. Next time I want to try a hot pot."}
{"text":"If it weren't for yelp, we would've never found this place.  It's a really sketchy and deserted area of Vegas.  The food is terrific.  Came here with 5 others and ordered stuffed chicken wings, soft shell crab with drunken noodles, crispy duck with drunken noodles, pad thai, short rib, and garlic prawns.  Everything was delicious.  Definitely the best thai food I've ever had.  However, it's also the most expensive I've had and the portions were small.  My group friends all left their still feeling hungry, but we all thought the food was really good."}
{"text":"Great Thai and a 72 page wine list, some of the best food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lotus was very good.  When you pull into the Commercial Center Mall, make a right and then it is almost immediately on your right.  You can't tell from the outside or decor (besides the dozens of photographs) that this place is so well loved.  I got the non-spicy vegetable soup, one companion got the spicy vegetable soup, and one got the spicy shrimp soup.  Mr. Shrimp Soup was gobbling up the soup, which he declared great, when he spit out a very spicy Thai pepper he had been chewing on.  It took half the meal for the burn to subside.  The spring roils were decent.  I got vegetarian chop suey which was yummy and the veggies are very fresh.  They don't serve fresh coconut juice.  The only real disappointing was the fried bananas, which were laden with an overpowering amount of coconut."}
{"text":"Our bartender told us Lotus of Siam offered the best Thai food in the West Coast. I'm inclined to believe him. It is definitely a restaurant of quality and class. 
Our appetizer of Fried Chicken Dumplings was typically good. We then enjoyed a Northern Thai Spicy Chicken Soup and Garlic Prawns with Drunken Noodles. The soup was deceptively spicy with a nice lemon undertone. The prawn dish was beautiful and equally delicious. 
My husband tried a Thai beer, Chang, that he loved. He stated the pairing of the beer and cuisine was divine. This assessment came from a man who could take or leave Thai food (it's not his favorite). 
The atmosphere at the location is cool, with its tables and sofas near the bar. 
If you're able to visit this location while in Vegas, I'd bet you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their most recent exposure on Top Chef: Masters had an out-of-town friend wanting to check this place out.  After our first visit  many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back.

After making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.

We were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  

* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.

* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.

* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.

* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.

When the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  

I did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.

Overall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?  We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant is considered the best Thai in Vegas. We have several better places in Southern Cal. The food was good, service was good, there can be a long wait for a table and the prices are a little high. Good but definitely not the best I've had."}
{"text":"The menu is huge! but the portions small and the price just not ok for Vegas especially for a Thai Restaurant. I guess the taste is OK, Unfortunately had better or I may have just ordered the wrong thing.

Definitely make reservations. We waited for about an one hour cuz of the people rush from the outlets and you got people going in front you cuz they were smart...also weird from a regular thai restaurant

Although they had a big menu it was a difficult to understand or I was just exhausted...but what's funny is that after going here...thai menus are so confusing..for one they actually put names in thai and describe the ingredients to you...but everything is almost the same...

We ended up ordering four things, pad thai, minced ground chicken salad - i think that's what it was, and the wings...the people i went with didn't want soup so that took out a quarter of the menu. couldn't do the fried rice because we were getting white rice another quarter of the menu. got the pad thai can't do the other quarter of the noodles. There was the fish but it was market price (so expensive). We thought you know its thai big portions we were still hungry! so we asked for the menu again and it took so long for us to look and find we want and we just told the waiter what he recommended. We ended up getting something that was off the menu - chinese brocolli with fried pork and hoisin kind of sauce with garlic. Took forever though but it did the trick!"}
{"text":"I was debating on writing a review as I felt it would have little impact since they already have thousands of awesome reviews but our meal was just that amazing,  I owe it to them. 

To start off, location.  When locating this spot,  it's very difficult so here are simple directions. When heading east on Sahara away from the strip,  it's about a mile down on the right side in a large shopping center. When you enter, make a right and it's on your right side next to a pool hall. If not, then you'll be driving around the large Center for a minute confused on its location.  Also for Las Vegas locals who've heard of this business, it's in the same shopping center as The Green Door.

Also MAKE RESOS! We went in on a Wednesday night and it was packed!

Food dishes ordered:

Apps:
Chicken Satay 
Wontons  (these were ok. Had nice flavor but needed more meat)
Cup of non-spicy veggie soup (ok, needed more flavor)

Meals:
Chicken fried rice
Chow mein 
Pad Thai
Pad Woonsen 
Sticky rice

Or main meal was awesome. The fried rice tasted so clean. Not loaded with sodium. It was our first time visiting  (party of 4) and everything was delicious. The service was spot on and the restaurant was very clean. This isn't a fancy place for dressing up but casual and an outstanding menu.

Definitely worth checking out but MAKE RESERVATIONS!! And don't be 5 mins late or they'll give it away"}
{"text":"On the way to this restaurant, my friend (a local) preps me for dinner. \"Now don't embarrass me by ordering Pad Thai, okay? This is a Thai restaurant with some incredible, authentic thai dishes...you need to break away from your Pad Thai habit just this once.\" Hahaha. The other thing he said was, \"This place is located in the Tenderloin of Vegas. It's sketchy for sure.\" 

So right on both counts. The food was so good. We had the fried prawns where the entire prawn is deep fried to a crisp and you eat it in its entirety. We also had the duck and the beef over rice noodles. It's not what I usually order at Thai restaurants, but I thought it was pretty darn yummmm. 

He was also right about it's surroundings. We were accosted by a couple of \"professional\" pan handlers, TWICE, in the parking lot. And he also pointed out some bar called \"The Green Door\" across the lot: a swingers club. So umm, yeah...it's a rather questionable area. 

But the environs doesn't seem to deter patrons from frequenting this place because it's busy busy. Make reservations if you're planning to come here. The service is friendly and the place is clean, though it lacks much character. 

So, if you want to venture beyond the Penang Beef and the Pad Thai dishes, ignore the panhandlers and head on in to get some awesome Thai food ;)"}
{"text":"I'll start off with something I dont really notice mentioned in other reviews - heat. We requested each dish at a 7 (1-10 scale) which I would have said anywhere. I like it spicy... but not here. Their 7 was like a 10 for me. BUT bless their hearts. We asked them to make the tom yum soup more mild and they were happy to do it as well as change our last order before it even hit the table with the kitchen to bring it down to mild - since at this point let's be honest our mouths were on fire.

All that being said this place is delish. This is now a staple for every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the states...and a nice escape from the Strip.  Last night I ordered the crispy duck with panang...level 10 spice.  If you're like me, you love the heat.  A word to the wise...most Thai places somehow think Americans can't handle it so even a level 10 isn't a level 10.  Lotus of Siam is an exception.  Be very cautious with level 10...even if you order curry.  My stomach is still on fire...they are very liberal with REAL Thai chilis that are fresh and smokin' hot.  This place has a good mix of tourists and locals so you know it's good.  On your next trip to Vegas, make sure you give it a try."}
{"text":"Good food but a little over priced. Portions are normal and not huge for what you would expect (considering that it's Thai food and for their prices) However, the food is good and they have a decent wine selection. Not fit for a wine snob but if you just want a glass or bottle with dinner it's perfect. 

The lunch buffet is decent and good (not amazing) but I typically hate buffets so this saying a lot!  It's just an easy spot to fill up at esp if you're in the area w big eaters so indecisive people."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and a huge menu of authentic Thai food. I enjoyed most of our dishes: pineapple fried rice, panang duck curry, Tom yum soup. Their spice and sauce tray is BANGING... like WA-ZOWWW spicy. I love my food spicy. Me and their spice tray became good friends. Haven't tried the new location but I will one of these days.

Try it out, it's a local hype."}
{"text":"Awesome thai food at a reasonable price. This restaurant is always packed, thus making the (already bleak) atmosphere a little less than desirable. Be sure to call a day or two ahead of time to secure a reservation! 

Minutes from the Strip but in a shady area, so be sure to not leave anything in your vehicle."}
{"text":"Tom yum goong, pad kapow gai with a fried egg,  and sai oua. Way too much food for me to finish but I there were just so many things on the menu I wanted to try. This is the best pad kapow I've had outside of Thailand. I wasn't crazy about the sai oua. I had originally wanted to get an Issan dish, but the waiter recommended the sai oua. The tom yum is was legit, though pricey for a small cup.

Definitely coming back here to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"A culinary masterpiece in Thai Food. Trust me when I say that this place is worth the 2hr wait. Though the prices are a bit on the high end side the food is really that good! Amazing High Quality Thai Cuisine. My family and I come here every time we're in Vegas. Our absolute favorite Thai Food Restaurant. Highly recommended: their Tiger Prawns, Tom Yum Kha, Fried Pomfret and Spicy Shrimp Fried Rice. One thing I wasn't a huge fan of though, was their SeaBass Drunken Noodles...it's not worth  the price. Despite that this place is a Must!!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about this restaurant, I finally got a chance to try this restaurant for myself. The food was excellent and absolutely to die for! The staff was efficient and will explain the menu to you if you don't know what to choose. I can't wait to go back!
 If you like garlic, I would recommend ordering the garlic prawns. The prawns were huge, absolutely tasty and crunchy. The chicken wings were sweet and fried to perfection. Both items were finger licking good!
 Ordered a cup of wonton soup for $4.95 which was the best wonton soup I have ever eaten! It was cooked with lots of garlic topped with cilantro and green onions. I will be returning to LOS for this soup! 
A small bottle of sake starts around $30. Huge selection to choose from, a big Plus! 
If you have a large party and love fish, order the Thai basil whole catfish. The catfish is so enormous with plenty of meat to share with your loved ones."}
{"text":"Luv this place! Thai food here was excellent. Very authentic. Only 10 mins away from the strip. When we got there they said 1 hr wait but we ended up waiting only 35 mins for our large party of 7. Their coconut ice cream wasn't so good...wanted to eat their mango sweet rice dessert but there wasn't any since it's out of season. Had their spicy shrimp salad and that was very good. All the dishes were great. We always order papaya salad, angel wings, garlic wings, spicy seafood soup, pad Thai noodle, fried pompano fish with spicy sauce."}
{"text":"From the outside, this area looks very sketchy... the kinda place you might wanna stand a little bit closer to the other people you're with kinda place. The food is great, a lot of spice! I had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab which was probably my favorite along with garlic prawns that were to die for. The roasted duck curry had a lot of flavor, and the coconut rice with mango for dessert- it's at first very different for a dessert, but as you keep eating it, it gets more comforting and enjoyable. I highly recommend calling ahead and getting reservations. This place was definitely worth going, like a YUM YUM GIMME SOME kinda place. Since Vegas is like my second home, ill prolly drop by every time I'm in town. It was totally worth the one hour wait I incurred."}
{"text":"Wow the thai food here was very authentic and exceeded my expectations. My friends and I did family style and ordered the famous garlic prawns, pad thai, duck curry, and tom ka kai soup. The garlic prawns was definitely one of a kind, each piece comes with the fried shrimp shell and shrimp connected only at the tip of the tail. Although the garlic prawns was on the pricer side (~$30), it is a must try! I also enjoyed the soup which was tangy with a nice coconut base. Not only was every thai dish absolutely delicious, but I also appreciated the contemporary but also cultural interior design. Lotus of Siam is a must try restaurant in Las Vegas! Plenty of parking is also another plus!"}
{"text":"have i been to enough thai restaurants to dub this the best thai restaurant in america (like many critics have)? absolutely not.

is it the best thai food i've ever had? absolutely. just go."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional here.  Some of the best in the area.  I had the chicken shrimp salad which was a little spicy.  My daughter had Northern red curry with chicken and vegetables on a spicy level 5.  She liked it, but I had a taste and it was too spicy for me.  Looking forward to more visits at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place like a mother loves her child. The food here is amazing and is noted for their chef who was featured on Iron Chef. She's amazing in crafting the best curry and tom yum ever. Thai food frenzy this place but make sure to make reservations beforehand as this place is always crowded lol can't blame the people cause it's amazing here."}
{"text":"I intended to make the Lunch UYE here on my exotic chopper rental, but, alas I got held up... Still, having already made it there, I decided to refuel myself and get a snack + thai iced tea. The grilled chicken satay skewers were tasty and great drink. The buffet side was nice, but the other side was rather more sleek. Nice service."}
{"text":"We knew that this trip, we needed to try Lotus. 
We tried for dinner on a Thursday night and wait was 1.5 hours, reservations for dinner were booked a week out :( the host suggested we come back when they open at 11. Lunch is first come first serve.
Flash forward to Friday morning, we show up about 11:05 and there were about 4 tables already sat and a steady stream of tables after us.
I got the drunken noodle prawn off the chefs recommendation , the FI got a street vendor special that was on the northern specialty menu and we go the #14 appetizer that our waiter suggested. 
No joke, best Thai food we've had. The originality the menu had, the last 4 pages...that's what you come here for.
Slap yourself if you get Pad Thai....
Food has major flavor....like an explosion of spice and heat and layer upon layer of it. Oh man....yep. that good."}
{"text":"Excellent menu with diverse items you don't see in your typical thai restaurant. Absolutely worth trying! 

If you are looking for pad thai, eat somehwere else.

The wine and beer list is very impressive.

The thai iced coffee was blacker than squid ink, but not overpoweringly strong."}
{"text":"Freakin' loved this place!!!!  Ok so I came here with a local....as we pulled into the parking lot, I was kinda sketched out.  My friend was telling us about the \"Green Door\" which was located in the same strip mall.  Well I don't want to gross you out so you can look up the \"Green Door\" for yourself.  LOL.  Anyways, my friend was telling me that this place is a little hidden gem.  Boy was she right!  We came on a Friday night and there were lots of people which was a good sign!  We started off with dumplings and beef nom tuk.  Both were excellent and full of flavor!  For my main dish, I settled with the Pad See Eww and it was amongst the best I've ever had.  I'd definitely come back here the next time i come back to Vegas.   Don't let the sketch strip mall scare you cause the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years, I'm sad that they have done away with the all you can eat lunch buffet because ordering off the menu can get a little pricey, but the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Came in with a big group and  their attitude is like they don't even want your business. Granted we didn't have reservation but they simply dismissed us and told us that we have too many kids and will take too long. And the phone is always busy. You would think they'd get a second line. Oh well, glad I didn't have to sit through dinner if their attitude is like this."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times and know their is a huge cult following here. However, I have left unimpressed to the expectations both times. The Pad Thai is chewy and overcooked and the curry's have been underwhelming, I actually prefer Komol in the same shopping center and honestly feel that Thai food in Vegas is lost here compared to Seattle."}
{"text":"Most likely the best Thai food in this country. Easy to understand why this place is a foodie destination.  Be prepared to wait if you go any time close to lunch or dinner, even on the weekdays. The Penang crispy duck while pricey at 23 dollars was out of the world.  Would also get the drunken noodle soft shell crab.  Yes this place is definitely pricier than most average Thai places , but precisely because it isn't average . Service is almost always great even with the volume they see here . Take that cab ride off the strip to come here, it's worth or it."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas this is must go to place for me. Yes this time I was bit disappointment. New restaurant interior was quite amazing yet their food wasn't good as it was before. 
Beef noodle soup was more of salty side and their legendary fried rice was less seasoned. Even if I am tiny person I always ordered these two dish for me to eat. I didn't finish both plates. 
I am writing this review hoping that they will step up in their food. Even if last place wasn't nice as this new place I miss food that I ate there."}
{"text":"Amazing food and period. Not heavy seasoning yet flavor really comes out all the way(not salty, not sweet). One of the wonders of this place is vegi. I dont know how they make Vegi taste so freshly even if they are cooked! I know for sure this place is one of the best Thai restaurant in the state and there is no doubt about it. Yet service wansnt 5 stars that is why I am leaving 4 stars here. Waiting water for 5 minutes and ask some sauce at the beginning  yet didn't get served until the last bite. Even if restaurant wasn't too busy because  it was lunch time. One more thing, since Thai is known as country of beautiful smile, I wish I could get food with service of little bit of smile seasoned with."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for many years! I love Thai food. I also used to be able to handle the spice, but that still doesn't stop me from enjoying it. I finally got a chance to try this place with one of my favorite people Dyanna. Since it was her lunch break we went at 1pm because at lunch time there can be a line out the door. 

The outside building is run down, but the inside of Lotus is huge and very chic. I was surprised to find table linens and cloth napkins instead of paper. They have a huge wine cellar that greets you as you are being seated. The waiters and waitresses were also dressed up. Really made me feel fancy. 

Lotus of Siam's menu is huge! They have anything and everything you could ever want when it comes to Thai food. I love that they separate the menu by regions of Thailand. In the end I decided on one of my favorite Thai dishes Pad See Ew with shrimp. (I used to be able to handle spicy food, but since my sleeve surgery three months ago my stomach can't handle it.) So I ordered a spice level 1. Dyanna ordered the Baby Corn and I think she got a level 6 or 7. 

Our food came out super fast. I have to say they made the best Pad See Ew that I've ever had! Talk about flavor! Wow! It exploded in my mouth. The noodles where all perfectly coated in sauce and were cooked al dente. Plus, they had it loaded with tender sweet shrimp. Dyanna let me try her Baby Corn dish and it was really tasty too. (I'm a total sucker for baby corn.) 

Our waiters were so attentive. When we were done they took both our dishes and boxed them up for us. They also brought our check quickly. Which is always nice when your on a time crunch. 

What a great lunch! Wonderful company and some bomb Thai food. I seriously can not wait to go back. I've been telling Joel I have to take him there. He had my left over Pad See Ew cold, hours later and he loved it. If you are a fan of Thai food like I am this is a can't miss spot. I'm looking forward to trying all their other tasty items."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in a less-than-savory part of one hell of a crazy town.  What I liked:  every bite I tasted!  We tried the sticky rice, the Pad Thai with tofu, the Khao Soi braised short ribs, the Issan Nua Dad Deaw beef jerky, and the Mussaman Curry with beef (pardon any misspellings, going by memory here).  The server assisted us with choosing some very delicious and unexpected wine pairings.  Very good and worth the wait.  We went on a Wednesday night around 7PM and while we were unable to make reservations earlier that day, we were seated in about a half hour (kind of risky considering the trouble one must go through to get there--but isn't that what Vegas lives by, afterall?).    

What I didn't like:  being asked to leave when we were only there for maybe ten minutes after finishing/still picking at our food (the people who were next to us, also a party of three must have loitered around for a good 45 minutes, which is inconsistent, hence the annoyance)--yeah, you wait a half hour to eat, then you get to sit for a moment and digest your food afterward, right?  I dislike how one has to taxi everywhere in this town and frankly you'd better bring a few friends to chip-in on the $40 RT cab ride to and from your hotel, but the food is pretty amazing and hopefully your work is paying for it all anyway.  I was disappointed that we missed out on any hint of spice (a Scandinavian-bred/fed toddler could have easily palated any number of the dishes we ordered, contrary to their warnings).  

Regardless, this is a very good place, worth the hype and a real breath of fresh air amidst the craziness of Vegas."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food we have ever had in the US.  First off it looks like a complete dump from the outside and you go inside and it is very nice.  Huge Wine selection, nice decor, great staff, clean bathrooms. 

The food is unbelievable.  The pad thai is simply amazing.  The shrimp for appetizer is lightly breaded and fried and you eat the whole thing which is odd at first but so good.  The drinks were great. The duck was probably the best we've ever had, very crispy."}
{"text":"Honestly this is a tourist trap. They charge a lot for super small portions. At other Thai restaurants you get twice the amount of food for a less money. 

The flavors are not bad. I think flavor wise it's pretty standard. The pad Thai is on the sweeter side, the green curry is more watery than usual, the pad see ew was good and chewy. The noodles were flavorful.  I also like their wonton soup.  

I've been to lotus of Siam before they moved locations and thought the food was good but it was never my favorite. I like Weera Thai or Archie's a lot more. But now that they moved their portions are wayyyyy smaller than before. Unfortunately I think they are just riding on the fame of their name. 

Oh and good luck with the spice level. It's always inconsistent. A 3 is wayyyy spicier than a 5 so I guess just hope for the best."}
{"text":"Came here and made the mistake of not making a reservation. Waited an hour in the stuffy waiting area.  When we got seated we ordered the pad Thai, the salt and pepper prawns and a beef dish. The pad Thai was really good. Loved the sweet noodles. 

The fried prawns were good but I don't think that's it's worth 27 bucks..... Definitely not worth it for me. The prawns were big and the flavor was good though. 

I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it was wayyyy too sweet. I think next time I will order better dishes that are not so pricey. But I definitely will come back and try again... with a reservation."}
{"text":"i went there after reading articles about how amazing this place is and i was somewhat let down :("}
{"text":"- Location: 2.5/5 The location is bit off the main busy roads in Las Vegas. Not really desirable, but just ok. They look like small and old, but inside is huge.
- Cleaness: 3.5/5 Good. A typical Thai resturant but clean and busy.
- Service: 5/5 A server for our table was great! He was very kind and smiley.
- Presentation: 4.5/5 More than we expected. 
- Taste: 5/5 Taste was even superp! Actually they were.better than my favorite Thai resthrant in LA area.
- Price: 5/5 Portion..hmm.. not too much but very reasonable in compare to price. Loved the price!^^
* I definitly will come back to this Thai stop by. Better than some casino buffets."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere is really nice! I don't understand the reviews saying this place is expensive! It's really not $12.95-14.95 per entree is normal for your local take out Thai. You get a really nice sit down experience for the same price! The service was great! We were in and out within 45 minutes! The waiters were knowledgeable and helped us pick out level of heat and choices! We had a hard time deciding so we ended up with 5 entrees and a dessert to split! We have lunch for the next couple days lol! Our total was $100! So cheap for all we got and level of service!"}
{"text":"damn this place is awesome, food is perfect and full of taste, i had to comeback and never regret"}
{"text":"The wife and I were scheduled to leave Las Vegas on a \"red eye\" on a Friday night, so we had to make lunch plans for our last day in town.  We had a taste for Thai and Lotus of Siam came immediately to mind.  We'd previously dined at the original location, which was still under repair/renovation, and had thoroughly enjoyed our experience so we obviously were curious about how it was going at the new location on E. Flamingo in the space that formerly housed Roy's.  The new Lotus of Siam was unsurprisingly much more stylish than that of the original.  It's location was also much more convenient to the Strip and was even within a relatively easy walking distance to the Hard Rock and even a doable walking distance back to the Strip (caveat...the wife and I like to go for long walks especially after a hearty meal so your estimation of an \"easy\" or \"doable\" walk may vary).  Unchanged, however, was the delicious food, specifically the Northern Thai dishes.  We had the Nam Kao Tod ($8.95), Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle ($26.95), and Nam Prik Noom ($11.95).  We loved them all and found them to be a great value for the price.   Don't go to Lotus of Siam if you're looking for Pad Thai and curries.  You'll likely be disappointed and wonder what all of the fuss is about.  However, if you stick to ordering the Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Choice selections, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fiancée and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  

For lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex mélange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \"curry-like\" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  

Lotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam really is worth the drive across town. I love Thai food and this restaurant is great. The service is fabulous. We had a reservation and when we arrived there was a line waiting to get in. We got in and we were sat right away. Our order for drinks and food was taken as well. Everything was prepared to perfection. I will definitely be returning. They have a wonderful and attentive staff. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"When I first heard that my cousin insisted on dining at this staple in Las Vegas, I had visions in my head of a fancy place with modern lighting and wood tables and such. You know, the stuff that celebrity chefs do when they go to Las Vegas, which is an underrated food city. Imagine my surprise when we're driving to the restaurant and it's off the Strip. Not only that, but the restaurant is in this little strip mall. No bells and whistles or anything from the outside.

But when we get inside (and a reservation really helps because otherwise, you're waiting hours on end for a table), it was such a different story. Ten guys and we order a bunch of food. Now, I'm not a fan of Thai food but I think I'm getting more adventurous with trying food. I heard just endless raves about this place and I had hoped it was warranted. After that meal? It was warranted. I tried pretty much everything we ordered. Not one dish was a weak link. I loved, loved, LOVED both the beef tamarind and the butterfly shrimp. The beef was cooked really to perfection. No blood, grilled right without a slightly burnt taste. The shrimp was crispy and so tasty. Great food, very little noise so you could talk to people at the table, servers who let you eat in peace.

Great place. Every Thai place I go to anywhere from now on will just be second rate in comparison. That's the sign of a worthy restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. 
And there's a good reason for that. 
I'm a fan of Thai food, and even though I'm not Thai, i know all about this authentic cuisine. 
This is by far the best Thai food in Vegas, and might be the best I've had in the nation. 
Be ready for at least 45 min wait if you didn't make reservation, but trust me it's worth it. 
Go for the Pad see ew. 
Go for the curries. 
Go for the whole fish.
And definitely go for the crispy duck Panang. 

Trust me. I know food."}
{"text":"The location is in a funny side of town, but the food out beats it; their 12:00pm to 2 
:00pm all you can eat lunch buffet is quite the catch."}
{"text":"Holy moly! Hands down the best Thai restaurant I've been too, a close second is in my hometown, Long Beach Thai. 

Okay, so this place is situated in a strip mall off the strip filled with other Asian restaurants, so don't be discouraged when you first arrive because the outside does look a little ghetto. We went on a Tuesday afternoon, walked in without a reservation and got seated (we got there at about 1 something in the afternoon, they close at 2:30 pm). 

My Fave: We ordered yellow curry with chicken and tom yum koong both spice level at 5. They do 1-10, 5 wasn't spicy at all, I think next time I will try 6 or 7. You have to have to HAVE TO get the Garlic Prawns, they are fried shrimp (with the shell still on) in a very tasty sauce. It's a little pricier item on the menu, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I can say about this place and hasn't already been said. The food in the service were exceptional, without a doubt the best Thai food I've ever eaten in my life. Truly an experience not to be missed if you're a foodie, or  if you just love Thai food and you find yourself in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious Thai food! Be aware that it is off the strip, so you'll definitely either need to drive or uber/cab over here. It's located in an abandoned-looking strip mall, so don't assume your driver is trying to murder you, this is seriously where it's located. I also recommend getting here early so that you can secure a table (that is, if you can't secure a reservation) -- this place fills up!

The crispy duck is definitely delicious and worth the money (glad everyone on here seems to recommend it). I don't remember if anything else particularly jumped out at me, though. I remember that they have a flowering tea that they put into a glass teapot for you! It was fun to watch. They were also willing to split the check of our huge group by table (we took up 3 little tables pushed together), which is always a win in my book."}
{"text":"pretty darn good.

the papaya salad, medium, was pretty good.  my coworkers thought it was too spicy but i liked it.

the green curry was good.  creamy.
the tom yum was really good too.  

expect spicy if you order medium. or maybe it was just that day.
willl go back."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed our experience here.  The wait was about an hour but the food came out really quickly and the customer service was on point.  We got the most talked about Crispy Duck with Panang Curry and the Garlic Prawns, with some Pad See Ew with beef.  I cannot describe how amazing the flavors were and how crispy the duck and prawns were! Yummy!  5 star experience!

For the price of the Chef Choice dishes (Crispy Duck with Panang and Garlic Prawns), which was over $25 each, it seemed too pricey.  The Pad See Ew was more reasonable at $11.95 and includes a choice of meat.  It is also located in a pretty sketchy neighborhood.  I would probably come here once every few years haha."}
{"text":"I'm hovering between three and four stars, but my one time dining at Lotus of Siam was so long ago, that I will stick with four until I get a chance to go back!

Having heard so much about this place prior to even moving to Las Vegas, I decided to check it out for lunch almost immediately after unloading the U-Haul. Ah, the good old days (circa 2007!), when I had the kind of free time that would allow me to wait an hour to be seated for lunch! Yes, the most memorable part about the experience was definitely the wait time.

By the time I got a table, I was famished and impatient and opted for the lunch buffet. Nothing stood out as particularly mind-blowing, but none of the limited dishes were bad either. I believe there was a minced chicken dish, rice, a veggie noodle option, chicken wings and a few soups along side some salads and condiments. I filled up and left satisfied, but felt no overwhelming need to return immediately.

Based on the other reviews and mouth-watering user photos, I know I will need to try again, probably for dinner, and order some of the more exciting options. I suck at advance planning- come to think of it, I did try to come back twice and found the place closed once and a line halfway down the block the other- but I do think LOS warrants another trip sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Ummm. Lotus is AMAZING. Period.

The pad thai is awesome. A little on the sweet side, but it's amazing. The curries are all delicious. Wor wonton soup = great.

Prices are great too for a place with such good food. Perhaps $12-18 a dish.

One thing is that there is usually a 30-60 minute wait there, but they take your cell phone number and text you when they're ready.

Another thing is that the service can bit rough sometimes. They're busy. Sometimes you can get ignored by your server. Sometimes they can be a bit rushy and impersonal. But hey, the food is good!"}
{"text":"Really, really good food! And that's what matters, right? Even at the $12-20 price range, I always find myself rushing to go back.


But they are very busy. You have to wait a half hour or so. But they have a cool thing where they text you when your table is ready and you could go do some shopping or something in the mean time.

I haven't loved the service I've gotten there. They're busy, the waiter/waitress doesn't come by too often, the food takes a while, my friend has told me stories of them forgetting dishes and/or bringing out some dishes an hour later than others."}
{"text":"You know when someone builds up a movie so much that when you finally go see it, your expectations were through the rough and you enjoy it but are still a little disappointed. I would say this is the most accurate description of my experience here. I had read the many hallowed reviews and critical acclaim for Lotus of Siam and while everything was perfectly good, from the Thai iced tea, to the Pad Thai, the Green Curry, and the mango sticky rice, I don't know what more I expected, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Perhaps a boost and refresh to the ambiance will push it over the top, hopefully the new location will help in this regard!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Thai food.  Whenever I get the opportunity, I try to go there and bring friends and family.  It is incredibly deceptive in its appearance as it doesn't look like much from the outside and is in kind of a seedy looking strip mall.  I just park near the lights and remember to hide anything valuable.

There can be a bit of a long wait depending on how many people are waiting (a bit of a gamble on when to go).  However, it is always well worth it.  

I love that the food is representative of so many different places and regions.  I love the Yellow Curry and the staple I always order at every Thai restaurant, Pad Thai.  The curry isn't soupy but a good consistency and the Pad Thai is delicious as well.  While the portions can be a bit small compared to other places (I'm 6'0, 190), three dishes is usually enough for 2 of us easy."}
{"text":"When members of my family came to town, they solicited the help of me. My years with Yelp gave them full trust to come to me with recommendations around the valley. On one of those nights, everyone was in the mood for Asian food, so I decided to take them here. I've taken food out of this place before but never really sat in and ordered. What a great opportunity!

This place is located in a very weird shopping center. Lots of different shops and bars, to say the least. There are a couple of gay bars, a swingers club and a lot of Asian food joints. Also remember that if you don't make reservations days before, they will not take reservations that day and you will have to wait. A long time. For a party of 10, we were quoted up to 2 hours and ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes. The waiting room is pretty tight but filled with awards, reassuring you that this place was going to be the bomb! The service was great. They were efficient, didn't say much, but got us what we needed in a quick timely manner. The place was a little drab. Dark carpets and wooden paneling made for an outdated look. The main focal point however, was a wall full of wine. An actual wine cabinet filled with hundreds of bottles. Super dramatic and awesome! There's also a bar down the ramp inside, so you can drink something while you wait for your table. 

For dinner, me and my party decided on the following:

Garlic Black Pepper Chicken Wings for $8.95: Wings seasoned with garlic, black pepper and other seasonings. The garlic was prominent in this dish and made the wings soo delicious. One of my favorite things that evening!

Moo Yang for $14.95. Marinated charbroiled pork served with spice sauce. This is always my go to dish. The pork chop was super tender, the sweet marinade and the sauce really seemed to enhance the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this if you like pork.

Chicken Pad Se-ew for $9.95. Stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce. This was the best Pad Se-ew I've ever had! The flat noodles were soft but not mushy, the sauce was mild and salty and really made that dish pop out!

Pork Drunken Noodles for $9.95. Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with, sautéed choice of meat with fresh & dry chili, Thai basil, served on beds of greens. I loved the basil in this dish. It brought a clean flavor to the overall taste. 

All dishes were served family style and was awesome! People always talk about this place as being great. You really need to try this out, for sure! I remember waiting in the front at the beginning of the night and everyone that kept coming in, made a comment like, \"this place is in a sketchy neighborhood, but trust me the food is out of this world.\" It's not until you experience it yourself that you will truly believe that statement. If you're ever in the neighborhood, don't pass it. Stop, and give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow. By far the place Thai food I have ever had. I had 5 different food items, and the only thing that was just ok was the Chicken Sa-tay. The Chicken Sa-tay wasn't bad, the peanut sauce included was great, it was just the fact that it was so ordinary in comparison to everything else.

We started with the Nam Kao Tod which was crispy and nicely salted and spiced. The Chicken Sa-tay was next and it was good, but again, it was something I could get at any Thai restaurant and I would have rather used the stomach space to try something else, but if you're a big fan by all means order it because it is  good. We also had the Tom Kha Kai which was a nice coconut milk based soup. It was perfectly tangy and spicey (but not too spice if ordered mild) this was one of the best dishes of this kind that I have had. Not the fourth dish was Roasted Duck Curry
which was very good, nice and ducky if you happen to like duck. The curry itself was also very well flavored, but I would have liked a bit more meat in the dish. The last dish was the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass and it was to die for. The sea bass must have been cooked by a witch or sorcery because it was incredibly moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. In terms of cookery that sea bass was perfection. The noodles and sea bass complimented each other well, and this dish was the star of the evening.

We finished off our meal with an order of the Mango Sticky Rice topped off with a scoop of coconut ice cream. I am a big fan of sticky rice and this may be once of the best renditions of it that I've had. Nothing here was disappointing and the very reasonable pricing make this one of the best food experiences I've had, and my descriptions do not do the food justice. An absolute must try for anyone visiting Las Vegas.

This place is very busy and they recommend making reservations, even though I only had to wait about 15 minutes there was a much longer wait by the time we left."}
{"text":"What more can I add to all the reviews on Lotus? Well, it's not in the best neighborhood and there is a good chance someone will hit you up for change or to watch your car in the parking lot.  Somehow that all adds to the odd charm that is Lotus. 

For first timers you might think what am I doing here and what is all the fuss about?  Well, the food is unique and there are so many tasty options.  

All I can say if your staying on the strip take an Uber or Lyft over and back, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is excellent Thai food for sure. They have an appetizer that is beef jerky. In theory that sounds really really lame but it is actually one of the most delicious appetizers I have EVER had. There Tom Yum soup is also really good and if you order it extra spicy it is really EXTRA spicy (which I personally love, but I also love doing the Man V. Food spicy food challenges when I travel so watch yourself if you are sensitive to spice). Good food just go!"}
{"text":"Good food. We have heard about this place from a few sources and finally decided to give it a try. 
The shopping center that it's in is so dreadful that I honestly thought our Uber driver was taking us to the wrong place. 
If you don't have good Thai food where you live then this is a good place to go. If you live in LA then there are better places for Thai food there."}
{"text":"The holy grail of Thai food in the Las Vegas area. Savory flavors that range from intensely spicy to melt in your mouth smooth. The bar and signature cocktails are to die for. I went with the \"PAIN ERASER\" and I would frequent the restaurant's bar just for this drink. Delicious coconut liquor and orange juice topped with a fresh layer of coconut cream. The perfect beverage to cool your palate after indulging in spicier foods. I chose the Tom Ka Kai soup and the Pat Se Ew with beef. The soup is incredibly spicy and the entree can be adjusted to your spice preference."}
{"text":"Wow was this place soothing on a freezing winter night! Eating Thai warmed us up to our toes!! 

AMBIANCE: 4 - it's really warm inside in the winter, which was a really good change from the freezing cold outside lately! It was very homey and comfortable. Even though the tables are spaced far enough apart, it's a bit crowded from all the people! 

SERVICE: 4 - Service was good, they answered all our questions about the menu and are very kind. However, they were a bit slow and didn't refill our drinks! 

FOOD: 5 - The food was very good!! Every dish is delicious. Me and my friend had 2 curries and Pad Thai and 2 soups to have a whole variety of items, and it was all delicious! The noodles were the best dish, I might go back just for that dish! 

The special dishes were a bit on the expensive side. I'm gonna save up a bit and go back! It's worth it!!!

This place is worth visiting, it's one of the best Thai food places I've ever had :)"}
{"text":"My family looks forward to dinner here every time we're in Vegas. We always get the crispy fried prawns, Tom yum soup, crab fried rice, duck curry(my favorite!) and beef jerky. The jerky is for those with good teeth as it's not so tender but the flavor is great! 

Their new location is beautiful and even closer to the strip. It has its own parking lot now. I advise calling ahead to check for wait times or making a reservation."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Do not let the plaza fool you, this place is a hidden gem. 

Here is what I ordered for a party of four: 
1. Crispy garlic Pawn: OMG, I don't need to say much. You just have to order it !
2. Soft shell crab drunken noodles: they definitely know to flavor well.
3. Crispy duck penang- The highlight of our lunch. We can see why everyone rave about this dish. 
4. Coconut soup #23 on the menu: it's good but I wouldn't order it again. I couldn't finish my bowl, maybe I don't like coconut milk in my soup. 

 I love their thai tea as well. Wish there is a location near home."}
{"text":"Penang curry with crispy duck, garlic shrimp, and pad Thai was delicious! I normally get pad see ew but these other dishes definitely outshined my go to dish. The Thai iced coffee and mango and sticky rice was average but enjoyable! Good serving sizes too!"}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't already been said about Lotus of Siam? Amazing Thai food, plenty of seating, and great service. A restaurant as famous as Lotus of Siam doesn't need my paltry review to tempt you. Just go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was craving the soft shell crab but I didn't come here to not try their northern style dishes! And I definitely didn't haul ass from Arizona back to Vegas to eat pad Thai. 

There were so many to choose from. We went with the Nam Prick Noom, Northern green chili dip dish, and the Nua Nam Tok beef dish. 

The beef dish came out really quick. But it was luke warm. It was very flavorful. Many herbs and spices not used in Thai restaurants where I'm from. It tasted authentic. But there was a overpowering taste of cilantro. Loved the spice to it.

The chili dish wasn't what I expected. It was a cold dish. Green chili with additional items to bring out the flavor, including chicharrones?? Although weird, I really liked it.

Tip: don't forget to order a side of rice. It doesn't automatically come with the dishes.

The service was ok. I asked for recommendations and he just pointed out the northern Flavors page and the chief's specials. But I wasn't really given further advice. We weren't in a rush or anything but that's usually how I indicate that the service is slow. When I'm on my phone and realize 5 minutes passed and my check hasn't been picked up. Because we were there when they were closing till dinner, I'm almost positive we were forgotten a few times as they were focused on closing shop.

The place is decorated with a bunch of pictures of celebrities, reviews, and authentic pictures. A beautiful wine cellar to stare at. I'm glad I experienced it but my high expectations wasn't met."}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite Thai restaurant, so she took me here for my 70th birthday.  I always have Green Curry the first time I try a Thai restaurant - and was extremely happy!  One of the best, anywhere!
UPDATE:  Since the Lotus is a bit pricey for me, I tried the other two restaurants there, and found Arawan to be the best of the three. Just saying..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exquisite!  I was recommended to this establishment by a sommelier who said they had a rare and incredible wine list including the best Riesling in the world.  I was nothing short of amazed.  I had an incredible bottle of wine and the best Thai food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had! I am a Vegetarian and have tried all the curries with Tofu, with Panang being my favorite. It was really good and spicy.The only drawback is that there is a long wait and we need to make reservations to get a table in the evening. Many times they are booked already and the minimum wait time is close to 45 mins - 1 hour! Would recommend it definitely though :)"}
{"text":"I recently decided to stop eating the same things and start trying new stuff. New stuff including Thai. I have had Thai before so I am not a total neophyte. A friend and I decided to go out and had heard great reviews about Lotus of Siam. I Googled them, of course, to see what we were in for. I saw the words \"Extended Wine Selection\" and was immediately on board. The location is not the best in Vegas as the Commercial Center (yes, that is the actual name of the strip mall) has seen better days. Parking was plentiful and the restaurant was easy to find. Walking in, it seemed a little small until we entered the main dining room saddled by a giant wine cellar. The decor looked better suited for a mid 1990's country club, and was sort of all over the place, but not kitschy or themed which I appreciated. 
   The moment we were sat, waiters sort of came out of nowhere to bring us plates, water and cutlery. Extended wine selection is an understatement. The wine menu is larger than the food menu. I chose a cabernet on the lower end of the price scale as I am no Rockefeller and was pleased with it. Most impressive was the two wines that were ordered came in the appropriate glasses. One red and one white. (This is rare). 
   Once ordered, the food was brought to us very quickly. I ordered the Seafood Fried Rice and my friend ordered the Mint and Green Chili Beef (spiced at a level 9 out of 10). I was surprised at the serving size we were given for an entree priced just north of $10. I was full at the end of the meal with no appetizers or desserts. (Also rare). My friend, being more of a Thai food junkie than myself was satisfied that \"this place wasn't messing around\" when it came to spice. Apparently, many restaurants fall short in this department. The seafood tasted wonderful in the fried rice and included shrimp, crab, calamari and scallops. 
   The noise level was average, I didn't feel like everyone could hear our conversation, and try as I might, I couldn't eavesdrop on anyone else. The overall feel of the restaurant was unpretentious, relaxed and the service was consistent, yet unobtrusive. Toward the end of our meal, we were elated when the current Mayor of Las Vegas and his wife, the Mayor-Elect, were seated next to us and seemed to receive the exact same service level as everyone else. 
    Overall, I was pleased and will be returning many times in the future. A lot of reviews are right on the money when they say this is a hidden gem in the heart of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Lotus of Siam has been called the \"best Thai restaurant in North America\", and I think it's warranted.  I love the Duck Curry.  But be warned: if you say you want your food prepared \"spicy\", they make the food VERY spicy. Even if you think you can handle spicy food, you may want to order \"medium\"--which is still very hot.  The wait is usually quite long, so make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"I had to try this spot especially since Chrissy Tiegen is a fan. It's super authentic is all I can say so if you're used to more Americanized Thai, this place may not be for you. Things are more on the sour side. However, their Tom Kha soup is A MUST. I came on a Saturday at around 6 and it was not too bad of a wait. I might have made a reservation, I cant remember. All their dishes are affordable though and it's at a spacious plaza with lots of parking. Service isnt bad. Pad thai, chicken satay, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice were all good, as expected. The tom yum soup was alittle too sour for our taste, but again, order their tom kha (with coconut milk), it was great!"}
{"text":"This was probably the best Thai meal I've had in my life. Plus they've got some interesting northern Thai dishes I'd never heard of before. It surpasses the authenticity of food on the strip while being far more affordable and still relatively convenient. 

Bottom Line: I'll make it a point to revisit during my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This is probably the number one restaurant in vegas with extensive wine menu. Absolutely ridiculous wine list. From $6.50 KJ Chardonay to $5000 bottle of wine. They probably have it.

Now, what about the food. I try two of their dish, didnt like one of them so gotta send it back and replace it with the penang curry. I think its only ok. Its thai food, so what can really be super special about lotus of siam? 

Lots and lots of caucasian and foreigner thats for sure. Heard from one of my friend that the chef used to cook for the king of thailand. Maybe I pick a wrong dish, but I will definetely try it again one more time."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to Vegas. Let the cute elderly waitress/owner order for you and you can't go wrong. There is a spicy fried squid dish not on the menu that keeps me coming back for more"}
{"text":"Delicious and amazing. Tourists and locals should plan to eat here at least one time. The food is authentic and the atmosphere is appropriate for any occasion. You will not be disappointed.

I would highly recommend the Khoa Soi."}
{"text":"Had great yelp reviews and apparently a lot of movie stars go there... we're locals and honestly... we'll stick with our other thai places. There are plenty of them in vegas. Curry is overpriced and not that impressive, but I have to give it to them, their menu is pretty extensive if you want to try different kinds of thai food or have random twists to fancy it up.

would not go back given the other delicious options in town."}
{"text":"I thought this place was phenomenal! With great, friendly/informative service and a great atmosphere, I really enjoyed my experience here. The noodles that they use for the pad thai were different than what I was accustomed to, but I thought it was great!!"}
{"text":"I came here again, because I know I can only have the best Thai food in Vegas outside of Thailand. It's a tourist trap, but it's 15 minutes from the strip & people still go here regardless of the difficulty to find the restaurant's awkward green light, shaded doors & dark plaza . 

We followed Anthony Bordain's footsteps & tried their Thai curry noodles, ground pork as well as their sticky rice & pad Thai. Curry noodles were to die for!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review, as I've eaten here probably 10 times over the past few years.

They've remodeled and can now fit many more happy patrons inside. The menu is the same but the portions are *slightly* smaller. Still amazing though and I'll go back every visit to Las Vegas that I can. 

My favorite is the Green Coconut Curry, Pineapple fried rice and the Mango Sticky Rice. The last visit back in January, 2011, I brought a well-traveled friend with me and he could not get enough of the flavorful delights I ordered.

His first question the next morning (at 10am) to me was: \"What time does the Thai place open?\"

Ahhh, can't wait for my next trip to Sin City for your sinfully good food!"}
{"text":"I am a huge thai food fan and was really looking forward to this place but it was a miss. The food was super oily and lacked in flavor. Our service was bad. Dishes we ordered were forgotten and only after being reminded several times were they brought. The only redeeming thing was that the noodles themselves had food flavor and texture which is key to thai food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"@FoodieBear and @katfishkh did me a solid by recommending this place after seeing me check-in on @Yelp at another Thai place (Archi's, decent in their own right).

I have driven past this sorry looking, God-forsaken strip mall a few times over my many trips to Las Vegas and never once thought about stopping in.  As you drive by on Sahara it looks like sketch all the way.  Major sketch.  With graffiti on top.  From the back.  You see the back of the strip mall.  Not sketch from the back, that's gross.

When you turn in it's not much better - people of Vegas, would you please patronize these poor businesses up in here?!

But once you enter Lotus of Siam you feel like a sprightly lotus blossom yourself.

Well, you feel like you're on to something good.  And you are.

I had the lunch buffet and it was very good.

I'll be back to try the regular menu.

And Thai hot.

Fire."}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the wait.  Must order garlic shrimps, crispy duck panang, satay!!  I am always too busy eating these that I didn't have the chance to explore the rest of the dishes in the menu but this place is definitely worth the wait and the drive off the strip!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers saying this being the best Thai restaurant. This is a must stop each time I come to Las Vegas. Yes, the location is not the best but it appears to be a little better than in the past.  It is not on the strip, but it is well worth the short drive as the line of customers arriving by taxi can attest.   It is not fancy, modern or nicely decorated, but the walls are filled with autographed pictures from the celebrities and famous chefs who have come here to eat.   The foodie magazine awards and reviews on the walls give you something to read while waiting for a seat.  Once seated be ready to listen to the advice from the waiters and be ready to absorb yourself in the wonderful food.  Most tries are the garlic prawns, Thai beef salad and fish and drunken noodles.  Too  bad this place is so popular because now it is harder to get in."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is one of the top Thai restaurants in town. 
I'm glad that they created a second location. 
The new place has an amazing atmosphere. 
The service was spectacular. The reason I like coming here more than other Thai place is because the got so many other dishes that are great other than pad thai. Which it's everyones go to every time they dine Thai. 
If you have tried this and you're a local native what's wrong with you ?  Go try it. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!! Although there is a waiting time for dinner. There are plenty of tables available inside while you might have to stand outside waiting for a table. As for food green curry, yellow curry, red curry (extremely spicy), durken seafood noodles and padthai are a must try!"}
{"text":"We ordered a take out. 2 garlic prawns and 1 soft shell crab papaya salad, and the total was over $80. Ouch!!!
Too pricey. The food was good, but I think the price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. Great service. Everyone is so nice. Warning...the spice is serious Thai spice. So be careful I almost burned my tongue off. Get the Garlic Prawns...you won't regret it. The best thing to do is to anything you wouldn't normally get at your local Thai place. Forget Pad Thai, Tom Yum or Satay. Go for the serious authentic Thai and you'll love it. I have to eat here everytime I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is great here but I don't think it's worth the hype. I've had better Thai food. I think it's overpriced for what you get. The flavors are well balanced and everything was cooked perfectly. But the portions were smaller than I expected. 

They have a decent wine selection - better than I expected from a Thai restaurant. There is a bar inside the restaurant, so you can get a drink while you're waiting for your table. 

I'd want to go back to try different dishes. I'm just not sure it's worth the wait or the prices."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

The finest Thai my wife and I have ever had.  Worth the trip off-strip.  We come here every trip now.

Excellent wine selection for a Thai restaurant.  Spicy here actually means something, and even medium-spicy comes out with some good heat.  We've focused on the northern and Issan dishes here, but even the old classics here are done very, very well.

The papaya salad is one of the best, if not best, we've ever had.  The pad thai here is also very good - not the sweet mess that comes out at most Thai joints.

We have also had:
Khao soi - my single favorite dish.  Excellent
Northern larb - very good, packs a kick
Nam prik hed - probably our least favorite, but it is not bad at all.  Just the weakest of a strong group.
Kang hung lay - excellent pork dish
Nam prik noom - quite good, lots of veggies with it
Koi soi - a fine dish, not spectacular

We will always come back here and focus on the northern dishes.  Service here has been excellent, the food has been flawless, and I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"It remains the Thai restaurant by which I measure all others in the US.

Opened in 1999, it earned the title of \"Best Thai Restaurant in America\",  a James Beard award, Wine Spectator's Grand Award of Excellence, and spawned Vegas' other great Thai eatery Chada Thai and Wine (closed May 2018).  Many celebrities have enjoyed their food and while this new location doesn't have the same appeal as the original Badlands dive, the food speaks for itself.

Tip:  The menu has over 180 dishes.  Check it out online before going.

In general, fresh ingredients including herbs and spices, lots of veg both raw and cooked for texture, good quality fish sauce and fermented shrimp paste all combined to create the classic, sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter flavors.  Heat (user selected from 1 - 10) is achieved using chilies and oils usually associated with the dish.  No mouthful of ghost pepper just to achieve heat.

Menu standouts include:

 Som Thum (green papaya salad).  A load of fresh chilies, smashed with peanuts, basil, lemongrass, fish sauce and lime juice then mixed with crisp green papaya.  Refreshing and awakens the palate.  Adding steamed Chilean Sea Bass chunks to it (chef's choice menu option) makes it even better.

Koong Char Num Plar (raw prawns).  Chilled, peeled, raw sweet prawns dressed in a salty fish sauce.  Spoon over some chili tamarind sauce for a kick and wow, the flavor explodes.  

Crispy Duck with panang curry.  Crisp skin duck breast sliced and mixed into a creamy, coconut based red curry.  The ducks natural meaty, gamy flavor is enhanced by the fermented notes of fish sauce and woody notes from a splash of congac.  Lots of fresh chili flavor and heat.

Catfish dishes are also well prepared.  A very slight muddy flavor permeates the fish that may be off putting to some but IMHO adds to the overall flavor of the fish.  

Experimenting with something new is rewarded but so is trying your local Thai favorite and seeing what it can be elevated to flavor wise.  Common dishes like Rad Na (yellow curry rice noodle) or the staple Pad Thai are excellent.

Service is very efficient and friendly.

Very good wine program with reasonable off Strip markup.

The Lotus remains the Thai restaurant of Vegas and a must for any Thai food lover."}
{"text":"Vegas, day 50.  Final day of a successful WSOP.  Celebratory / farewell dinner for my poker buds.  Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sautéed fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure."}
{"text":"A must for lovers of Thai cuisine. Lotus is the real deal, authentic through and through. The flavors may even surprise you, if you have not had true Thai food before. The menu is large but perhaps the most noteworthy dishes are the distinctive Northern Thai options. I never miss the Tom Kha soup, Nam Kao Tod, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi. Enjoy a Thai Tea or a very refreshigng Tsing Ha to drink, not to mention the excellent wine list.
There is often a wait but that speaks for itself. When locals to wait to eat somewhere, there's a reason. Much has been written about this humble location and it's award winning chef, Saipin Chutima, and the hype is real. Service has generally been quite good, sometimes slow, and yes without reservations you can wait awhile for a table. However, they also offer take out so you can happily place an order and simply pick up your food which I do often."}
{"text":"Wow, my friends told me about this restaurant! The wait was long but, most definitely worth it! The shrimp appetizer was to die for. The duck curry melted in your mouth. Wow, I would come back no questions about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam was every bit as good as everyone had told us it was. It graces a bunch of \"top 10 things to do in Vegas\" lists, and the last few food shows about Vegas we'd watched (like Bourdain's Parts Unknown) have visited it.
We arrived about fifteen minutes before they opened for lunch and there was already a group of people waiting in line, and as we waited four more groups pulled up. We were seated right after they opened, and followed everyone's advice to order from the Northern specialties page - I got the Khao Soi with chicken, and he got the Northern Laab. 
The Khao Soi was amazing - nuanced layers of chile flavor and rich soup body of coconut and broth. I wish this were available from my local places, but then again, that's the whole point of Lotus of Siam - fantastically prepared dishes that we can't really get anywhere else.
The laab was good, a little strong for me but D liked it. He did find a small piece of clear plastic in the rice that needed to be picked out, but other than that it was a good dish."}
{"text":"The place looks like a dump friends m the outside, the walls are covered with pics of celebs that have dined here.  What your coming for is the food, so don't be surprised if you get get and have a 20 min wait for one of the 35 tables."}
{"text":"This place is definitely tasty, but not the zOMG I was expecting considering all the raving reviews. 

We ordered fish cake (meh... kinda greasy and meh. I've had better.), Prawn appetizer (a good sized shrimp, but that's all it was ... crispy wonton wrapped around shrimp), Nam Kao Tod, Chicken rama, Braised short rib Panang (very nicely cooked and the curry was excellent to drench the rice in), khao soi beef, ginger sea bass (this was OK... It reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes, which has better flavor... probably because of the MSG), and crispy duck drunken noodles (again, this reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes which I like more). Despite me liking the Chinese versions more, these dishes were still pretty good. 

I also had pretty solid Thai Coffee and a very bold glass of Riesling wine. 

Service was fantastic even though they were obviously running around because it was busy. 

If you go here, you will have an enjoyable meal and friendly staff. Do not be deterred by the shadiness of it from the outside. Inside is quite welcoming. Bright and clean."}
{"text":"In the words of my sister... Lotus of Siam...fucking delicious!

nothing like getting of the plane in vegas drunk and going here for lunch! Seriously I cannot wait to go back just to eat here (well and gamble but yeah). 
Yummy prawns in a blanket! and their wine list is so extensive for a thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This is the best \"Northern Thai\" cuisine in Las Vegas!!!!
I put emphasis on the term Northern Thai because that's their specialty,
Although, you can order great Southern Thai food here like Pad Thai or Kung Pao but it doesn't meet the high expectation.

Having watched the Andrew Zimmern and Anthony Bourdain videos, I had to check this place out.
It's recommended to make reservations in advance otherwise you better call ahead and be there by 5:00pm sharp to avoid long wait times. 

I asked the waitress whats the most popular and she gave me these suggestions.
She didn't disappoint me and the food was out of this world. 

Nam Prik Noom (Green Chili Dip) - Fantastic! 
Crispy Duck Panang - (Best Panang I've ever had!)
Garlic Prawns - (Mountain of spices with texture like a potato chip!)"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas for a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of my life.  On a Thursday night, 8/25/2011, I was looking for somewhere to go to dinner.  I didn't feel like going to a buffet because I just spent $90 on the Rio Village Seafood Buffet the night before where the food and service sucked!  So, I turned to Yelp to look for a good place off the strip, and found Lotus of Siam.  

This place was a little hard to find on Sahara Blvd, but with my great sense of direction, I was able to find the place with no problem.  I was craving shrimp for the night, so I ordered the Drunken noodle prawn and Crab fried rice.  At first they brought out Drunken noodle soft crab.  Our waiter gladly took the wrong food back and shorty brought the right one out.  

The moment I laid my eyes on the feast before me, I was blown away.  I have never seen shrimp deep fried this way where the shell and the shrimp were separated but still connected somehow.  The taste was heavenly and the spice level was perfect.  The crab fried rice was also good, not too oily and not too salty either.  The service was also great and fast.  I had my water filled without asking for it.  It was so good, I went back the next day for lunch.  

Two thumbs up for the cook!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because Lawd knows I love love love Thai food!  This was dubbed as The Best Thai Restaurant in America (even the concierge at The Palazzo raved about this place) by Food Network, but alas! FN has failed me again. 

First, it's in a seedy area in Vegas.  Second, for a very 'famous' place, the waiting area barely fit 6 people.  It's hot in Vegas! Waiting outside feels like waiting in an oven.  Third, everything is wayyyy overpriced.  $25 for 4 pieces of mid-sized prawns.  Those prawns tasted superb but geez! 4 pieces?  Fourth, the service is mediocre.  They took forever to acknowledge us after we sat down and for drink refills.  

Other than the crispy fried prawns, the rest of our meal were just ok.  We ordered Pad Thai with shrimp& chicken (this is how we test new Thai restos we try, if you can't do this impressively then you fail as a Thai resto), Thai fried rice, and two other dishes I don't even remember (one was fish and the other was sautéed seafood with vegetables).  Our bill totaled way over $150.  $150 for 'just ok' is unacceptable.  

Compared to our fave Thai resto in San Francisco, this place is no match.  Like I said, I really wanted to like this place but as much as the chefs in FN and the concierge raved about it, it's just not that impressive.   

The two stars is just for the crispy garlic prawns!"}
{"text":"Dont be confused with other Thai Spots in this area. They have the plushest Thai food food ive had to date. The crispy duck, duck curry is life changing. Pad Thai is delicious Salmon curry is on point the spices really range from1-10. 10 is real spicy but delicious when your in vegas do yourself the favor and grubbing here. 

Overall Joint deserves a 5 for food but the hours arent the best. We found our selves wanting to go when it was closed all faded out here haha. Nontheless its stil beautiful food in a ugly part of town."}
{"text":"Overhyped. While definitely serving up good food, it definitely didn't blow me away. The curry was good, the pad kee mao (drunken noodle) was good and the chili dip was good but the prices for the chef's specials are rape! $25 bucks is not worth it. The portions are meager.

It's a great place for those who don't know what great Thai food tastes like, and for those who should know and still rave about this place, I want what you're smoking.

TLDR: Overpriced dishes, small portions. \"Must try\" dishes are $25 bucks. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Hmmm where is this at again? Commercial Cntr on Sahara? Isn't that location kinda sketchy? But I'm glad she was persistent and got me to go because it was one of the best hidden treasure this part of Vegas I did not know about at all. I wouldn't say hidden because this place was packed and very popular with the locals and I, being a native of Cali, this place was a good find.

I'm not familiar with Thai food at all so I had to yelp it to see what people craved here. Only thing I knew on the menu was pad tai noodles.  Nam Kai Tod was a good appetizer to begin with. Some sort of sweet crispy brown rice. You have to try this if you have not before.  My partner in crime ordered the glass noodle salad which had a very lime taste to it.  I love sour food and the flavor was just perfect.  It's not an appetizer but it might as well be because even an anorexic can't get full from the amount of glass noodles that was served.  Best to order one for yourself instead of having to share it just as I and my friend did.  Next on the line was the drunken seafood noodle. I'm not very good in describing flavors but I'm just here to tell you this was freaking delicious. It gave many options of flavors in one plate, from shrimp to muscles and the noodles in it.  And the last was the dessert! Damn I've never had one this good. Coconut ice cream on sticky sweet rice. One word to describe this is, can I have some more!? Alright it wasn't one word but you know what i mean.

The only sour taste that came out from this was I had to pay for her too. Wtf, she's my ex, haven't the rules changed? I ain't gotta pay for you no more, but I hate looking like cheap boyfriend in front of the server because we look like we're on a date.  

Definitely give this place a try, especially if you're an out of towner because this place has won many food critics and awards."}
{"text":"The Thai food was different than back home in Hawaii, but delicious none the less. Their prik nam pla sauce is also different then back home, but we loved it as well. Very large restaurant that was very busy. Menu is also very large making it good for big groups. We'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I've dined at LoS at least a couple times a year and every time it's been enjoyable. It's a must-go-to every time I visit LV. Overall, the food is great and service is attentive and friendly. No wonder this place is always packed. Reservations are recommended especially if you have a larger group. 

The Food:
I can't think of an item/entrée that I didn't like. The flavors are spot on and you can tell that they take pride in what they serve. The entrées are family style, so everyone in our party can enjoy the tastes. 

Here are some of my favorites (that i remember from the top of my head)
- Garlic Prawns
- Pad Thai
- Spicy Fried Rice
- Seafood soup
- Chicken satay (appetizer)
- Roasted duck curry

I know i've missed a few dishes but you can't really go wrong. A definite must-try if you love Thai food. Be sure to check out the seasonal items as well. 

Other notes:
The location is a bit hidden and sign (green at night) isn't flashy. You may also see a few people waiting outside. But when you walk in, you'll see that LoS proudly display articles and photos with celebs and people within the community. The restaurant is nicely lit and atmosphere can get a bit loud, but not annoying at all."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Everything here is amazing. We had a dry German Riesling that was to do for. The Larb was fantastic. I need the recipe to get my own ground beef to taste that flavorful and amazing. The pork fried rice, drunken sea bass, green curry with chicken, garlic prawns... AMAZING. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I LOVE good food, and so we're always looking for good restaurants.  Because we love THAI food specifically, We've had thai from maybe 30-40 different restaurants.  Lotus of Siam had a great rating so we tried it out.  

Awesome.  The atmosphere still had the small cozy Thai place kinda feel to it, but it was fairly large, and well decorated.  The selection of wines was impressive.  The food matched the visual offering and the service.  They made good recommendations for sides and appetizers, and every one of the dishes was rich in flavor.  

GREAT GREAT Thai place to try if you're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I really love thai food. So given that this place was so close to me and I'd never tried it, I really wanted to like it. The outside is shady to say the least. However when you walk in its ten times nicer. Staff was good. But overall the food just wasn't that great, especially for the price. I had two of the most commonly raved about dishes. The drunken noodles with soft shell crap and the crispy duck in curry. Both were less than awesome. I did have the tom kah which was pretty good. But overall the food just felt...greasy. And not all that tasty. Blah! I just feel like I've had so much better thai food in Los Angeles for half the price. I'd save your money, or order one of the lesser expensive dishes."}
{"text":"Great place to visit off the strip. A large choice of items, some familiar and some new to our group. Everything was delicious. We got the garlic prawns and the spicy seafood salad to share before our meals. Definitely make a reservation ahead of time as it is always crowded."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is indescribable BUT the quantity is soooo small... 
i went straight here after my graduation & i had a party of 8. We ordered a lot of food so we could do it as a buffet style where everyone could get a taste of everyone else had ordered at our table. We asked our waiter if one plate would be enough for each dish we ordered and he confidently said YES. Unfortunately it wasn't. The portions were soooo small. I don't mind order two orders of everything but since we were told wrong we had to order everything twice and had to keep waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for every single dish because we had to order it again later on and not just one big order. It wasn't busy as well during this time."}
{"text":"BEST Thai Food I have tried since visiting Thailand! The food is extremely authentic and tastes amazing. I had the crispy rice as an appetizer.. it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth! Each individual piece of rice was packed with fresh lime, Thai chile, and cilantro. There was onions, tomatoes, and peanuts mixed in which put this dish over the top! I also got the Yellow Curry-medium spicy and it was very good. The serving size was perfect, and the flavor was great! The service is also great!"}
{"text":"I remember visiting my grandma and eating delicious Thai food. I also remember her house had various Buddhas, Thai figurines, elephants, and a picture of the Thai king and queen adorning her home. Going to Lotus of Siam is like going back to my grandmas house except they charge me and I have to share this place with other people. It's in a sketchy strip mall, it's insanely busy ALL the time, but I'd brave it all to come and eat here. The food is authentic (seriously my grandma would cook this stuff, I didn't know that Pad Thai was \"Thai\" food until much later in life) and I can't imagine a place that does some of these staples anywhere else. If you come for lunch you have the option of doing the buffet. DO NOT DO THE BUFFET. You may as well just hit up Buffet Asia. Don't go to any restaurant that has a James Beard Award and even think about the buffet. 
I've been here so many times that I can't list all the dishes I've had. NONE of them disappoint. If you're nervous or unfamiliar with Thai food ask your server for some recommendations. If you're familiar with Thai food, but not so familiar with Northern Thai food order a few familiar items and get at least ONE thing you've never had before. There's a reason it's busy,there's a reason it's won awards, there's a reason I feel a real sense of nostalgia for grandma's house when I'm here, and there's a reason my mom (also from Thailand) has trouble eating Thai anywhere else. This place is good because they showcase authentic Thai cuisine and they try to honor the culture via taste buds. If you want to go, but hate waiting (I feel you man) visit at lunch when they first open and make a reservation."}
{"text":"If you want to get away from craziness on the strip and have a fantastic thai food, come here.
We had spicy beef salad, kao soi and mango sticky rice and they were are excellent!"}
{"text":"I agree this is worth the taxi fare from the strip.  I especially enjoyed the flight of Reislings, but of course the Thai food was also very good.  Lotus of Siam is good enough and memorably enough that I'll make an effort to visit again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was here years ago and dined in and it was amazing.  We got takeout today.  3 stars for being exactly on time, but the food isn't the delicious and high quality food I remembered. I think it's unfair to compare takeout to sit down.  Food just tastes better when served hot.  I  remember it being the best Thai food I had eaten outside of Thailand, and maybe tonight was an off night, but we had guests who love Thai food over (so naturally I thought of Lotus - we don't eat there regularly now because our kids aren't adventurous...) and I was apologetic after the meal.  Hopefully it was a one-time poor experience on a busy long weekend.  Come on Lotus, rooting for you."}
{"text":"I am so excited to go back to Vegas I had to write a review on this gem- this is the BEST Thai Food I have ever had in the States and we eat a lot of Thai food:) Every trip to Vegas we don't even think about where we want to try because Lotus of Siam is our go to spot and yes..it is just that good! It has gotten more popular so I recommend making a reservation. Last time we went for 3 of us it was 1 1/2 hour wait but totally worth it still. I went for my bachelorette party a few years back and that was the first time I'd gone and so happy to have found this place:) Everything is good there, I can't even pick 1 dish..."}
{"text":"Make a reservation!
This was easily the best Thai food I've ever had, and it's crowded for a reason.  It's totally worth the trip off the strip to get the most amazing authentic Thai food.  Everything, the vegetables, meats and seafood were all fresh and cooked perfectly.  Be careful with the spice levels though, if you don't usually have spicy foods, don't be brave.  The servers were super patient and very helpful too."}
{"text":"Just had the best meal. Sea Bass and drunken noodles. Garlic prawns and crab fried rice are all simply amazing. The flavors were all commentary and yet different. The perfect place to go with a small group because everything sounds and looks so delicious. You will want to order more. This place lives up to all the hype and awards."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. service is fast, the food is delicious, the spicy level is for reals. 

must tries: crispy rice appetizer. roast duck with panang curry. drunken sea bass. garlic prawns (and eat everything. even the shells). spicy beef salad.

there's also an awesome red curry with egg noodles, the name for which escapes me but I think it was on the northern Thai menu. 

the menu is extensive, so be adventurous. there's a few dishes that I wouldn't order again, not because they were bad but because they're not as strong as others and you can only eat so much in one meal, so why waste an opportunity? I didn't love the jackfruit curry on the northern Thai menu, mostly because I didn't like how brothy it was. the green curry dip on the northern Thai menu was good but more of an appetizer. the regular larb was delicious, but a small portion. 

seriously so good. get a big group, fill up a cab and go family style. best meal you'll have in Vegas."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food you can get. It is off the strip in this hidden but very large shopping plaza. I remember it being super gray and not interesting but I think they recently renovated it and it is now a more interesting yellow. Parking was no problem and when we went during lunch, there was no wait! The entrance seems small but the restaurant is quite large and very roomy. 

Garlic Prawns - amazing! these massive prawns are deep fried and lightly seasoned. You get both the meat and shell. The shell is deep fried to the point of crunchy awesomeness. 

Crispy Duck in Panang Curry - one of the best Panang curry in a long time and the best Thai dish I have had in a while. The crispy duck is definitely crispy and the duck pairs really well with the spicy curry. Definitely pour some on top of rice to have a great meal. 

Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles - delicious! There is so much basil flavor and have plenty of soft shell crab to go around! The signature ingredient is the baked/dried basil that gives it a very unique flavor compared to other Thai restaurants that I have tried. Definitely worth ordering!

Thai Tea - a must get if you're ordering spicy food. It tastes fresh and not too sweet. 

Overall, this is one of the best Thai places I have ever been to. Their specials are a bit pricey compared to the ones in SD but it is WELL worth it."}
{"text":"When I read this had been voted as the best Thai restaurant in the country, this place deserved a visitation. Another off the strip place that had me question if our cab driver was abducting us... The restaurant itself is very unassuming from the outside in a strip mall however all that pleasantly changes once you enter.

The decor is a marriage between the classic Italian restaurants in Chicago that adorn their wall with all the celebrities who have been there and a Classic Thai restaurant you would expect to find. A massive wine cellar in the dinning area adds a unique dimension. 

The service here is impeccable. Our server Somchai was extremely gracious, relaxed and accommodating body language. We accidentally ordered the wrong appetizer which he gladly took back and got us the Nam Prik Ong, ground pork with a red tomato sauce curry served with vegetables and pork rinds to dip, very unique. For entrees we went with the drunk noodles with Seabass and the crispy mint duck. When I say they're both made to perfection, I mean it is perfection. We chose spice level of 5 out of 10 which worked out nicely to blend with the flavor without being too overpowering.

This is a must for folks traveling to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, either location. Took my boyfriend for his birthday, since he said it was his favorite thai food in vegas. We had a great time, the servers were wonderful. As of right now, they do not have a liquor license, but you can byo-whatever. I do wish i had know that.  I had the crispy duck drunken noodles, and the duck was so good. He had the short rib something, and very much enjoyed it. Definitely make a reservation though, if you can. I made ours 2 weeks ago, and there were many people waiting. We got seated promptly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mother is a Food Network afficionado, so of course, after hearing that many of her favorite celeb chefs have been to this restaurant, we had to check it out.

Don't let the outside fool you (we almost didn't enter because of how sketchy it looked at night).  It is great inside.

Dishes for dinner are all in the $20+ range.  A bit pricier than I'm used to for Thai, but it was fine because the quality of the dishes was excellent.

That said, I didn't LOVE absolutely every dish.  The Nam Kao Tod, which everyone raves about, wasn't anything special to me.  Crunchy, spicy, and good, but nothing to write home about.  The pad thai was also very good, but again, nothing to get excited over.

Why the 5-star review then?  Because the dishes that did stand out were AMAZING.

The Garlic Prawns (you eat them shell and all) were a real surprise.  I hadn't intended to order them, but our friendly and patient waiter recommended them when I was floundering with my dish choices.  Holy smokes!  My FAVORITE dish of the night.  So light and crispy, I actually ended up liking the shells more than the meat of the shrimp!

The Sea Bass over Drunken Noodles was PERFECTLY cooked- super moist and flavorful.  I'd have this any day of the week and twice on Sundays.

The Crispy Duck in Panang Curry was so flavorful and fatty.  Mmmm... Definitely rich though, so don't order this if you're feeling like something light.

The braised beef was... wow.  Melt-in-your mouth good.  This, like the prawns, was suggested to me by our waiter, and I'm so glad I went with his recommendations.

Last but not least - the wine.  We had a delicious reisling (surprise, surprise - recommended by the waiter).  It was so good that we took the bottle with us to a nearby liquor store to buy some more."}
{"text":"1. Food:
A) Tofu Green Curry: Flavorful and perfect. I somehow ate all my rice soaking it up with the curry
B) Steam Ginger Sea Bass: Fresh and tender, a bit pricey but very healthy choice
C) Fried Rice: Chicken or was it Crab spicy something, either was it was so good. A tad bit oily but our whole party loved it
D) Curry Noodles: Not bad, but not my favorite
E) Raw shrimp: They had it with their special sauce and with lemon, it was so good
F) Tom Kai Soup: It was good but too sour for me. We can skip it for next time. 
G) Whole fish: Forgot what it was called but its one of the fish that was a whole fish not fish and they deep fried it with pour sauce over. 
H) Thai Tea: Delicious
I Wine: They have quite a big selection, so we had the Dr Loosen 2012 Sonnemhr: Not pricey and went well with the meal
2. Decor: Simple asian restaurant. 
3. Price: Fair, not cheap but for how good the food tasted it def wasn't considered pricey. 
4. Service: Really great and attentive even as busy as they were. Walk in's were at least 1 hr to 1.5 hr. So make sure you reserve before hand. My coworkers and I always go here after our convention so we make sure we plan it beforehand."}
{"text":"Glad I waited a couple days before finishing this or they would have been lucky to get two stars out of me. I guess it's hard to live up to the \"BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA\" billing. That creates some pretty unrealistic expectations. 

Still ... 

The place has a great vibe -- kinda like eating in someone's home. I would suggest that, unlike us, try going when they are not in the middle of their lunch buffet. Even though we ordered off the menu, I think the kitchen struggled to get out of their all-you-can-eat mindset. 

The BEEF JERKY ISSAN STYLE (#13A) was an adventure. Nice as a diner to try something this unfamiliar. Had really interesting flavors but before the beef was jerked the silver skin (tough and bitter) was not trimmed properly (or at all) and some of the bites were chewy in an unpleasant way. 

The NAM KAO TOD (#14 Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage) was really amazing. If you like that essential Thai taste of lime, powdered-toasted rice and fish sauce, make a point of trying this dish -- it was very good. The only criticism is when they say minced, they're serious. The sour sausage (which looked suspiciously like tiny cubes of chopped up ham steak) was hard to pick out (tastewise) from the other flavors. We ordered it medium and it was plenty spicy (we had two small children with us). This is a dish that I suspect gets better when you dial up the heat -- but even at medium was outstanding. 

I ordered the KANG HUNG LAY (pork stew northern curry, #K from the NORTHERN menu) and it was good. This is a \"dry\" style curry so if you're looking for lots of gravy to sop up with your rice go another direction. Some of the chunks of pork were fatty and some were a bit parched. I am a sucker for anything braised (I like the mouth feel) but without much liquid everything seemed a little dry. Still, overall, the dish had, as other reviews have mentioned, a nice homey feel. 

THAI LIME DRINK was a nice touch on a hot LAS VEGAS afternoon. 

However, the YELLOW CURRY (#129 with chicken) was really disappointing. My wife ordered it to share with the kids since it's one of their THAI favorites. In all fairness WYATT, my three-year old, ate more than his share and seemed to enjoy it -- then again he insisted on a McDONALD's happy meal on the drive over from SAN DIEGO. The chicken was grainy. The carrots were really al dente, the potatoes were nearly raw (literally not figuratively) and the yellow-curry and coconut cream base were thin and sadly bland. I think if it sat on a steam table for an hour or two the vegetables would have cooked through and the curry itself would have reduced down and concentrated the flavor. 

The single best THAI restaurant in North America ??? I don't think so but still, for the most part, pretty good."}
{"text":"Some of the best thai food in the country, and certainly the best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What did I missed  ? 
Seem to be a lot of hoopla about this place, so we were a group of 3-4 Thai ( born / raised in Thailand ) checking this place out.
Boy, American people are so easily pleased. 
Don't quite understand the dilapidated  location compare to the strip and vast openness of Las Vegas, Is that mean the owner can not quite get it together? 
People seem to be begging to eat here, some came in Limousine. 
We agreed that mass majority of street food in Thailand can beat this place by far,  Price and food test. Pretty sure MSG. is a main corporate of these stars. ( I away get real thirsty after yummy MSG. of a good food ) 
Next day we went to Chinatown ( Spring mountain & Valley road something ) There were 2 restaurants facing each other. We tried one of them which is pretty much same or better by $5- $10 a dish. 
Still not sure what I missed. PS. notice that sugar  and star rating goes in the same direction for most Thai food in America. It does not work that way in the real Thailand."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant this side of the Pacific Ocean.  It is hard to find.  Highly suggest you take a cab!!  Order the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles.  They do Duck to perfection!!  Love, love love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Bad experience at Lotus of Siam. Food not taste that good. Food come out at room temperature more on the side of getting cold. Service was ok. This is my second time. First time was 4 years ago and it was ok. Anyway so disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food in a very dull setting. Overall, I really enjoyed the food, but I feel this place  is a bit overhyped, perhaps due to lack of good Thai in Vegas overall? If you have good Thai food where you live, don't go out of your way to eat here unless you're really in the mood, as there was nothing here terribly out of the ordinary. If I were in Vegas, with a serious hankering for Thai, I would go back, but don't go here expecting an otherworldly food experience, unless of course, you've never had goo Thai to begin with.  The curries we ordered, and the jack fruit salad were our favorites, we weren't quite as impressed with the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"The spot to go to in Vegas! I love the food here, I've gotten the veggie ka soy and veggie pad Thai and the curries, everything is good! Try to make a reservation because it gets really busy. But make sure you come and eat here."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try!!! Although they're a bit pricey for what you get, it is worth it. The food was great, the flavors were amazing. Be careful on what level of spiciness you ask, because it's really what they're gonna give you! 

Overall, a two thumbs up coz it got my tongue all numb after going for a level 5."}
{"text":"Great good and service. We got to meet the owner and he along with his family  are wonderful hosts.  See if they will show you the wine cellar!  Its way cool.  Its popular so prepare for a wait of typically 30 to 45 mins - don't worry though, I promise you won't regret the wait!"}
{"text":"lotus is the best, great food and service - proves quality will always will over location"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, make reservations!  We shared the popular crispy rice appetizer.  So many flavors, mint, ginger, garlic, spices, peanuts, I'm sure I'm missing some.  Be sure to order one.  
I got the cod, I believe it was black cod, steamed on top of steamed cabbage with a spicy pepper sauce on the side.  This was a pretty healthy dish, fish on cabbage I skipped the rice.  He got the duck in a panang curry.  These were huge pieces of duck, easily split this entree.  The duck was seasoned well and crispy from pan frying.  The curry was very good, and medium was a good level of pepper.  They were out of the mango with sticky rice, so we split the coconut ice cream.  The ice cream tasted homemade, chunks of coconut in it.
An awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food was as good as many of the people noted.  The service was fast and the ambiance was surprising after looking at the building from the outside!

Around meal times I think you are generally going to have a bit of a wait as it seems to be very popular judging by the number of people that were there when we came at a bit of an off time.

Give this place a try you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food I've ever had, but it is really pricey. I had the delicious crispy duck panang and garlic prawns, which were finger-licking good!"}
{"text":"Wow, where to even begin? We saw Lotus of Siam when searching Thai food in Las Vegas on Google. I thought it was this place I went to last year, but as it turns out, this one was different. I'm glad I didn't try to nail down the other place and we just ate here. The wontons and egg rolls were deliciously crisp and fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was to die for.

Then we moved on to dinner. The Beef Pad Thai was superb and the spicy fried rice with chicken was excellent. The presentation of everything was elegant and the taste was fantastic. The service was outstanding and efficient. They tend to get very busy here - there was a line running out the door the entire time we were here. We got here at 5:30p opening and there was already a line. Overall, it was a very pleasing experience and we would return."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed by the quality of food at this location. Don't get me wrong the decor is beautiful and they finally had enough seating at this location but there is no quality control anymore. We ordered the garlic prawns, pad woo sen and fried rice. What was really disappointing was the garlic prawns. The prawns were over cooked and dry, the pad woo sen had no flavor to it because they added way too much egg in the dish so you couldn't taste any of the sauce and I really thought the fried rice was going to be the saving grace of the night but I was wrong it was really greasy. We also ordered a tofu soup as an appetizer and it seemed like the broth has been reducing for too long because it was really salty. Really disappointed in this place because I looked forward to visiting the new location and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I've been a regular at the old location for two years now. A word to the owners daughter, Penny if you want this location to grow your family business please make sure that you uphold the same standard throughout all restaurants. For 1, your chefs shouldn't serve bad food and for 2, your servers should've caught it at the expo window and asked for a refire. I would have rather waited an extra 15 minutes for another garlic prawn than to eat over cooked and dry prawns."}
{"text":"This place is outside of the strip. If you're taking taxi from the strip to the restaurant on a weekday it's about $20. A little bit iffy location but the food is good. We got seated quickly (but I heard the wait is long on weekends). Apparently there's a lot of famous people who have eaten at the restaurant, hence all their pictures on the walls. 

The only downside of the flavorful food is their portion. I've heard they cut down on their portions and jacked up the prices. I guess it's good for the restaurant's business but for us customers, it makes us not want to go back. 

Overall good selection of food, good service, just not good for big parties unless you want to order 3 or more orders of pineapple fried rice at $12 each to feed a party of 5."}
{"text":"Really good, but I like Archie's better. As a local, I was happy to see this place doing so extremely well!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam definitely lived up to the hype. The food was really great, particularly with regards to the main courses. Appetizers were all decent, if a tad boring (with the exception of the bacon and wonton-wrapped shrimp). The wontons and dumplings were only offered with chicken, while most of us would have preferred pork. The beer and wine list was quite good, and I even saw one of my favorite IPAs for a jaw-dropping $3.50 (though our table opted for Singhas all around - when in Thai restaurants, right?).

The entrees are what really got everyone excited. Our table was filled with drunken noodles, pad Thai, curries and more. My crispy duck over drunken noodles was excellent. I mostly stuck to the outer edges since duck is just so fatty by nature, but I was able to get the flavor I wanted from a few of the leaner bites with my delicious noodles. I requested my heat level at a four, which was perfect for me (I like things spicy but not uncomfortably so). A friend requested her shrimp in green curry at a four, and it seemed much hotter. So I'd probably knock that down to a three. 

Even though the food was awesome, the service was a bit spotty at times. It was hard to pinpoint which person was our main server. We had to ask for drink refills more than once and a requested knife was never delivered. Still, I would definitely like to return on my next visit to Las Vegas. 


*Out of towners, definitely make reservations and know that a cab ride is going to cost you."}
{"text":"\"The single best Thai restaurant in North America\"? Well, that's a lot to live up to, Jonathan Gold of Gourmet Magazine. I thought it was pretty good but nothing mind-blowing. 

The shopping center this is in was more memorable than the food. It was ridiculously RIDICULOUSLY big and full of really random strip mall retail oddities. Lotus of Siam was the gem of the center. There were a few run down restaurants but mostly really random businesses."}
{"text":"Ordered the Khow Soi and Red Curry.  Both were very good but the Khow Soi was really stand out and brought us back to Thailand."}
{"text":"I have heard from so many places about how this is supposed to be the best thai food this side of (insert thai city here), but my friends and i left very disappointed.  We shared the satay which were good.  The pad thai was really disappointing.  My bf and i also had the thai fried rice and the yellow curry.  Neither was anything to write home about.  This was hardly the best thai food i have ever had.  Honestly I wish we had just eaten at one of the places in our hotel instead of having to get the car from valet and drive here.  with all the dining options in vegas, especially on the strip, i doubt i would be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dining experience here. The thai food was authentic, and the servers were extremely helpful. I'd especially recommend drunken noodles and crispy duck- Yum!"}
{"text":"So here's the diggity... The food is above average (taste) and the prices are cheap, hence why almost 2k reviews and 4 stars... I got 3 dishes, beer and wine, and got out for $60, with an excellent meal.  

In other words, don't put yourself out and wait crazy time to eat here, it's not like the food is earth shattering or anything you can't find at another Thai restaurant, but if you want a great meal, cheap, with a massive wine selection, (and willing to wait an hour) this is the spot.  Call for resos!"}
{"text":"OMG. I knew I loved Thai food before dining here. But after... I have a truly newfound LOVE of Thai cuisine when it tastes like this!  I'm talking pure ecstasy in your mouf!  The flavors and textures of each dish were to die for.  

The garlic prawns are a MUST!  I seriously ate these with my eyes closed as fireworks exploded in my line of vision with each bite.  

Order some kind of curry - Khao Soi with duck, panang, red, green, or yellow... They're all packed with flavor and amazingly delicious.

Most importantly, make sure to have a reservation. Even with a reservation you'll still have to wait, but luckily there's a bar to make the waiting time fly by.

I will definitely need to stop by here with every visit to Vegas.  I'm a total fan!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food to be found in Vegas. The group of us ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup and Tod Mun fish cakes to start. I've had the fish cakes here before and they are, as always, soft and flavourful, especially with the accompanying diced cucumbers and sweet/sour sauce. The soup had chicken that was a little chewy, but was nicely spicy and piping hot-- though to be honest, I'm not sure why we ordered soup in 105 degree weather!
On to the entrées, which were a mixed bag for me. I enjoyed the nuttiness and creaminess of the Penang Curry (paired nicely with tofu) as well as the Pad See Ew noodles. The sweetness from the palm sugar was noticeable in those dishes but were not overpowering. However, the Mee Krob crispy noodles tasted oddly chemical-like to me. I just could not eat them, and I think it was just the combination of spices and vegetables that created a strange odour and taste. The northern curry with (sparse) catfish was a little on the bland side for me and not quite what I'd expected. It was almost like soup; sauce was thin and did not hold up to the rice I drizzled it over.
Overall, the food was good but nothing was outstanding. An enjoyable Thai dining experience, nonetheless, especially in their newly-renovated space. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay - I've been reading about this place for a long time now...

I was overjoyed to finally eat here once and for all.  The place is located in a bizarre open shopping square area off the strip.  Some of the neighboring shops I noticed were a Korean place, a billiards supply store, a few gay bars, a gay gym, and yes, a full blown all out Sex Club for swingers and singles.  Wow.

When you walk into LoS, you notice right away that they didn't put a lot of attention in the design or presentation of the restaurant.  I saw lots of old wood on the walls, with several framed photos of celebs that have eaten there.  The restaurant was somewhat maze-like with halls and alleys leading all over the place.  I was surprised to see a lunchtime buffet there, but I stuck to the regular menu/

I ordered what turned out to be perhaps THE tastiest Pad Thai I've EVER eaten - and that includes genuine Thai places in Bangkok.  The noodles had a golden caramelized nuttiness to them - something I never experienced before, but really enjoyed.  Same with the thai iced tea - very pleasing, and again, perhaps the best I've ever had before.

Price wise, items were maybe $2-3 more than most other Thai places, and portions seemed to be a little on the smaller end of the scale.  Not a big deal, seeing how the food tastes so damned great!

4 outta 5 stars from me, I'll return to indulge in some heavenly Thai grub the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the chicken pnang. Be sure to get the spiciness at a 6, which is perfect. I had a 7 but it was a little to hot.  My husband had the crispy duck with pnang on the side which is key to ensure the duck is crispy. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I decided to go by for a late lunch and dining alone is no big deal.. its a liitle after 2p made it there b4 they closed.. i have mixed feeling about this place.. the food by far is excellent -;ordered yellow curry,  nice healthy chucks of potatoes , carrot, onions and bell peppers, came with a little tin of rice, just a tad too little rice... i like my rice with curry sauce.
Today service was slow, seems like took forever to cook and bring food out- dining alone with 1 dish.. lots of different waiters and waitress.. prompt refill on water. Took awhile to get my change after i paid cash, as seem like the head help ask me if i need something- yeah my change... and dont call me sir...
Lots of parking, but i heard breakins too, since you cannot watch your car- they blocked out their windows..."}
{"text":"Garlic prawns!!! Sake!!! Strip mail... Sums it up"}
{"text":"Dinner at LOS was a MUST on my TO DO LIST for my first Vegas trip, and while most of the dishes we ordered were great, they were not excellent like I had expected

We ordered the Tom kha gai soup, Nam kao tod, Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodles with Seafoods, and Penang Curry. The drunken noodles with seafood was my least favorite. The chow fun noodles were all clumped up and the sauce was underseasoned. I agree that the Garlic Prawns are a must order, but the portion is really on the small side. I really enjoyed the heat of the Penang curry. It was defintely the spicest penang curry I've ever had. My friends didn't enjoy the Nam kao tod but I found the bright flavors of the salty&minty crispy rice mixture quite addicting. 

Overall, while not life changing, we really enjoyed our dinner at LOS. Though I'm not sure if I would make the trek back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Thank you Anthony Bourdain for reviewing my favorite restaurant in Vegas!  Never would have found it without you! Fried garlic prawns and fried duck with red curry were so good! Enjoy, but make reservations.  Hour wait is normal the locals say"}
{"text":"This place is popular for a reason. I've been to this hole in the wall before even yelp was up and running. A friend of mine took me here in high school and I was hooked. Best thai food in Vegas for sure. If you are new here try their \"Fried Garlic Prawns\", \"Drunken noodles\", \"Catfish Salad, and any of their curries or fried rice!"}
{"text":"If there is a mythical foodie destination in Las Vegas, it is Lotus of Siam, or as the pros write it: LOS. Every card-carrying foodie from San Diego to Buffalo knows the lore of the Thai restaurant with the chef who catered to a king, or something like that. Cab rides to this Commercial Center restaurant are probably second only to cab rides to [insert most popular strip club]. (Despite my name, I don't know the strip circuit scene.)

There is a lot of hype, which perhaps make it easy to disappoint, but at the same time it is an off-the-beaten-path hole-in-the-wall, which makes it easy for folks to think they have discovered Mecca. I had waited to write a review because I had only been there once four years ago, and I felt that I needed to give LOS another try. The first time I went I strayed from my usual Thai curries and ordered some Northern Thai specialties. I was disappointed. I thought it was overpriced and undergood.

Last night, I went back for a second tasting, and I ordered curries. The red and massaman curries were good, solid Thai, but the portions were a bit small, and the vegetable selection included baby corn-- a pet peeve. Plus, they do not have one single grain of brown rice. 

They underwent a mysterious renovation, which somehow involved more tan paint and a wall in the middle of the dining area, but that is just a side note.

I am really torn because I find it hard to contradict years of sentiment and foodie dogma, and I am thinking that perhaps the true gems of LOS are specialty items that I have yet to order. When it comes to Thai, I am so happy with my curries and rice, I never want a specialty item, so for me, it would not be worth a 45-minute wait or an expensive cab ride, but the other day when we were dining next door, we met a man from NY who has the food Fed Ex'd to his house, so there has to be something there. 

In the meantime, I'll be noshing on brown rice at Thai Noodle."}
{"text":"Good food, strange location.

This place is way out of the way in a commercial industrial shopping center. However, it's worth the effort to get here. They have a great selection of items, but I would highly recommend anything from the Northern menu.
I'm told the chef here is from Northern Thailand and those dishes are his specialty. Be adventurous, it would be a shame to go there and order phad thai. Live a little."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Vegas, for that matter, best Thai restaurant you'll find pretty much anywhere.  It's in a shady looking strip mall - don't bring your Lamborghini.  

The place is big, tons of tables, multiple rooms, but there is almost always a wait after 5:30.  Get there early, and enjoy the experience.

The menu is ginormous.  The service has always been comprehensive when I've been there - waiters are attentive, and help out with other tables when they're not busy.  

The food is great - think of it as \"upscale\" Thai without inflating the price too much over your neighborhood \"meh\" Thai place.  

Four stars because the location is weird, the ambience could be a little better, and because I can never betray my heart, which says that nothing in Vegas should ever, ever get five stars.  Ever.  Because, Vegas."}
{"text":"I had them bookmarked for ages! I've always wanted to go but never got the chance since we're often too lazy to get off the strip. Finally, I was able to go during my recent trip!

Read up that it's located in a  pretty sketchy plaza. \"Sketchy\" doesn't deter me from trying out good food tho! And it's a popular restaurant so I thought a lot of people will be there anyway, even on a weekday. And boy was I right! We came in for dinner on a Monday and the wait was 40 minutes! The place was packed!

Food is legit but it's not any better than what I've had in good thai restaurants in LA. Can't say it's the best but they do deserve the glowing reviews. Their seafood soup and pad thai are definitely tasty and I highly recommend them. Next time, I'd skip the panang and try the dishes that people are raving about (looking at ya, garlic prawns). There's definitely room for a rating update! 

I've always thought that good service is typical in Thai restaurants but the service here is pretty up there! Impeccable! They are super attentive and friendly!

Definitely hit up this spot for legit Thai food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Before you continue reading, go ahead and make a reservation because they get book relatively quickly, even by non-locals. Walk-ins might take over an hour or more on the weekends. I think that it's a good experience to try Northern Thai food because it's not very common, even in LA where we have plenty of options for Thai food. As someone who prefer spicy food, I think I prefer the Southern Thai style. 

Northern Dishes:
-- THUM KA NOON (Pounded & Shredded Young Jack Fruit) & NAM PRIK ONG (Red Chili Dip): the menu said that these dishes would be spicy, which was one of the main reasons why we ordered them. However, it lacked distinct strong flavors that I was hoping for. It was rather bland for my taste. I enjoyed dipping vegetables with both of the sauces though.
-- SAI OUA (Northern Style Sausage): was a little too dry and I tasted only the lemongrass. 

Featured Dishes:
-- GARLIC PRAWNS was absolutely divine! The prawns were perfectly crispy, including the shells. I would probably come back just for this dish. 

Our party ordered many other dishes but again due to my own personal preference, I thought they lacked the strong flavors and spice that I was hoping for. I'm very interested in trying their other dishes outside of their Northern style. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Over 2,000 people have already said the food is AMAZING, and I agree! The Thai tea didn't taste like it was from powder, but instead had a flavor that stayed on your tongue even after you drank it. The Pad Thai had just the right amount of sweetness to flavor combo to make it addicting to eat. The duck curry had pieces of duck that had more meat than fat, but just enough fat to give it that great taste. Everything we ate was great!

So, I'll review things I don't really notice. I was hesitant because the plaza where Lotus of Siam is located is pretty ghetto. I thought it would be dirty or run down. Wow was I wrong. Upon entry, you see all the awards that place received, including the James Beard award. Host was welcoming. Drink orders were placed right away (get the Thai tea). And most importantly, THE PLACE WAS SO CLEAN! Our table didn't feel sticky or wet. I saw a server wipe down our table but then dried it off too, which many restaurants don't do and just leave it wet (I hate that). The utensils were shiny clean, not even any dry water marks on them. Same with plates. Floors weren't sticky or stained. Walls were clean. Bathroom was exceptionally clean. All this just added to how great the food tasted. 

DEFINITELY eat at Lotus of Siam. Don't be fooled by outside appearances, as beauty is found within. And yes, food beauty is definitely found in Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"I miss this place already. I frequent here every time I flew in to Vegas for work and vacation. To avoid waiting in line for hours - make a reservation at least one month in advance and you'll be fine. Like other reviewers have mentioned, must try their garlic prawns, crispy duck with penang, and seabass drunken noodles! The dessert platter and thai tea are also very good."}
{"text":"Usually, Thai places are a hit and miss for me. So far everything we ordered were really delicious. I have no complaints. The service was fast too."}
{"text":"Did I miss something? Food was fine, nothing special. I heard about this place last spring during a trip to vegas and have been eager to try it ever since. Yesterday was finally the day and I was sadly disappointed. I'm not sure if I inflated my expectations to Hugh or what. I ordered the chicken green curry since its my favorite thai dish and the fried rice sausage app as recommended by the where as a specialty. So excited to have my taste buds blown away, I sat eating with sheet boredom. The app was just crunchy and sour tasting and the curry was runny/watery not creamy and the spice didn't kick in until I bit a pepper. 
Perhaps I didn't try the right thing but my thinking was everything should have been very good. Oh well."}
{"text":"Had some really interesting dishes that were pretty good, and I really regret that we didn't order more mango w/ sticky rice for dessert. Gosh that was good. More later."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas!   I have been to the new location 20 times already.  Definitely ask the waiter for recommendations but for me I love the Tom Ka soup, #14 is crispy rice with ham, Northern Lob, and garlic prawns.  Try to sit with April or Tarn.  Great people."}
{"text":"the food is really good. we went during lunch time so we tried the lunch buffet and everything was tasty. i love the green curry!"}
{"text":"It's a tourist destination, and sometimes the wait can be atrocious. So I mean you need to know that heading in. The Crispy Duck on noodles is freaking amazing, but for what it costs it should be a portion about 50% bigger. That's really my knock with LOS. The portions should be bigger given how much you're paying, or the food should just be perfect. That's where my 2 stars were lost."}
{"text":"There's over 1200 reviews for this place and that speaks for itself. It's also the only reason we decided to try it out and it was definitely worth it. From the outside, it's pretty much something you'd run away from and even our cab driver told us not to go walking around there... Well the inside is not that impressive either, then you notice the huge amount of celeb photos on the walls. Their wine list is over 100 pages. Service is outstanding! Food was definitely outstanding and worth it, even overlooking the decor. We had the Garlic Prawns and drunken noodles that was great. Loved the pad thai and surprisingly their coconut ice cream with sticky rice was great. I'm not big on non chocolate deserts and this was impressive in its simplicity. We would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"My sister is an LV local and took our family to this place.  It was amazing.  We got there before they opened the doors for dinner service since we couldn't get a reservation.  There was already a line 25 people deep when we arrived.  10 minutes before a hostess came out and wrote down everyone's party size and it only took about 10 mintures to get our party of five seated after the doors opened.  Our family usually orders too much food, so we always go home with left overs.  Not this time!  We ate every single thing on the table.  I'm pretty sure if it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the plates. We ordered the Tom Yum Prawn Soup, Panang Curry with Chicken, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi Braised Short Ribs, Sea Bass with Gnger, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves.  Everything was so delicious and perfectly prepared.  This is the kind of plance where I wouldn't mind trying something totally out of the box because I'm confident no matter how weird it was, it would be amazing!  So I'm giving this place 5 stars.  And just like Yelp says, five stars means... \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"Best piece of advise I can give you about LofS is to KNOW YOUR SPICE LEVEL.  If you don't just ask the waiter.  I've made that mistake once or twice and paid for it dearly during the meal.  Beyond that, most of the food here you can't go wrong with.  Try something new if it sounds good and generally it'll be amazing.

I've been here about a dozen times now and the tom kha soup is what keeps me coming back.  Absolutely amazing.   Having said that, usually we'll order 4 or 5 dishes and chow down, it seems that all the chefs there aren't exactly cooking the same meals consistently.  We'll LOVE a dish one night, try it again on the next visit and ... well... just isn't the same.  It's still good, just not mind-blowing *shruggs* can't win them all.

If you know you are planning on trying here, MAKE RESERVATIONS, if you are trying to get in last minute at dinner time, try showing up 15/20/30min before they open.  The line usually will already be forming at the time but I've had good luck getting in that way.  

Best of luck to you and hopefully you enjoy!"}
{"text":"There are so many things that can ruin a dish at any Thai restaurant, and in the course of three or four dishes, something's bound to put a damper on the experience. Meat can be loaded with gristle, overcooked, or undercooked. Curry can be oily, watery, too spicy, or too bland. Noodles can be too grainy or too soft, and break easily. 

Lotus of Siam pretty much hit the mark on all of these counts for me. Here's our breakdown:

- Chicken satay. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. This is usually the canary in the coal mine for me. The chicken was good quality, perfectly cooked, and seasoned so well that I didn't even feel the need to use peanut sauce.
- Yellow curry with chicken. This is mostly the reason for my 5 stars. It's my habit to only eat the chicken and the curry sauce on my rice, but on these two counts, Lotus of Siam is among the best of the best for this dish for me. The consistency was perfectly creamy, and \"medium spicy\" (4 out of 10, I think was what we asked for) provided the perfect amount of spice for those of us who don't like a ton of spice in our curry. The chicken was again fantastic quality and perfectly cooked.
- Pad see ew. This was a good dish. The noodles were prepared well, and the beef was very good!
- Crispy duck. This was mostly okay for me, although I'm not a big fan of duck to begin with. The seasoning was definitely the highlight of this dish for me.

We came here for lunch as a group of about 7 or 8 and got pretty good service! They are only able to split checks 4 ways. No reservations for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  It was worth the cab ride.  This was my favorite place I tried in Vegas.  Go."}
{"text":"Not so great, thought it was gonna be better, but flavor was not a wow factor."}
{"text":"I frequently visit Las Vegas. With so many celebrity chef restaurants around the strip, This was the first time I had ever thought of trying Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The restaurant wasn't too far away. It was approximately two miles away from the Stratosphere. It is located in a rather big plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant exterior was not much to look at. However, the interior is decently decorated and clean. After looking at the menu, my initial thought was this place is way too expensive for Thai food. Gave it a try anyway. I had the famous curry duck and various other plate, Which I do not recall the name (please refer to my pictures). They tasted really good, and I would go back for more given a chance. I would have given this place a five stars if the price is a little lower."}
{"text":"went here with a reservation. Upon entering the establishment the server asked for a text message confirming the reservation. No text massage was sent to me. I am from San Francisco and no restaurant out of the 100s I have been to asks for a text message conformation. In fact no restaurant in NYC, San Diego, SF  Miami, Chiaco has ever asked me for a text message confirmation. I will be telling every health professional and tech professional I know to avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is located in a very sketch area. Driving there, i felt very unsafe, but when I turned into the parking lot and saw about 50 people waiting in line for the one establishment in the entire area, I felt a little more at ease. I made the mistake of not making a reservation because I didn't know when I was planning on eating there and had to stand in line. Fortunately, I got in line just in time to not have to wait, even with 50 people ahead of me. 

For the food, I got the garlic shrimp which is their most popular item, and for good reason. Its not only tasty, and crispy, but just perfectly cooked. A little on the expensive side, but sure worth the splurge. Their drunken soft shell crab (don't remember its proper name) was also super delicious. My favorite of the night was their stuffed chicken. Moist and juice, the sweet and tangy sauce perfectly added an extra depth of flavor to the dish. We ended our dinner off with an order of their mango sticky rice and I was in love. I have never had this anywhere else to compare, but I was so happy I ordered this dish. The sticky rice was seasoned with a slight hint of jasmine flavoring so I really enjoyed that. The only thing I had that was disappointing was their Thai Tea. It was ridiculously sweet that I was unable to drink it. 

Tips: make reservations or get there around 5ish before they open. Or else you'll have to wait about 1 hour for seats to open. Order asap or again, you'll be stuck waiting for people to get their food if they ordered before you. (i ordered within 5 minutes of sitting and got food out asap where others ordered 10 minutes later and had to wait almost 30 minutes to get their food)"}
{"text":"Just a friendly note to add one more dish I tried to my review. We had the garlic prawns last time we were there. At $20 they aren't cheap, but they were divine! You can even eat the shell.. it was like soft shell crab meets prawns or something."}
{"text":"We were able to get sat right away at lunch. I'm not sure if the prices are different at lunch vs dinner but the portions are small and some of the seafood incredibly pricey.

1. Garlic Black Pepper Chicken Wings - Dry and bland.  No sauce either for dipping.
2. KRAPHAO MOO KROB - Very good but must eat fast before the pork belly gets chewy.
3. PAD THAI - Good but small portions.
4. GREEN CURRY- Really good dish. Lots of vegetables.
5. GARLIC PRAWNS- Could have used a side dipping sauce. However, the prawns were big and very tender. Loved the skin \"chips\"!
6. CHILEAN SEA BASS on DRUNKEN NOODLE - Another great dish. The sea bass was tender. However the noodles were sticking together and a bit dry.
7. Sticky Rice w/Mango - Very good."}
{"text":"After having my wallet, phone, and ID stolen for my very first Vegas trip on the first night, I needed a ray of light in my dark skies.  My friend had wanted to come here with a past boyfriend after hearing it was great so we decided to end our trip at Lotus of Siam.  

Holy mother of God this place is absolutely amazing and completely worth the long wait (And there will probably be a long wait).  I had the Nua Yang Panang while my friend had Yellow Curry which we didn't even bother sharing because we were too busy stuffing our faces to trade plates.  

Had I had my phone I would've Yelped to do some more research on equally amazing dishes.  I hear the Northern part of the menu is where it's at.  I will definitely be back anytime I visit Vegas, this place is a MUST."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place. We go every time we visit Vegas. The garlic shrimp... Wow. It is a nice atmosphere and the taste is out of this world."}
{"text":"Foodies say this is the best Thai restaurant in the US. This place has an overwhelming number of complimentary reviews so I won't over do it on this review. I will mention two things we ordered .....The crispy rice appetizer, Nam Kao Tod is amazeballs! This is not a typical fried rice that you find in any Asian restaurant, this is actually deep fried rice with a spicy, tangy and utterly delicious texture and flavor. I've never had anything like it. We also ordered (amongst a bunch of other superb dishes) the Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass. The fish was melt in your mouth, the flavors.....drool! This food paired with some sick German Rieslings made for the best 30th birthday dinner a girl could ask for. Way better than paying out the nose for a uppity dinner at a famous chef's restaurant on the strip. If your in Vegas and appreciate ethnic food, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Fav Thai joint period. Fair prices, friendly, fresh food n damn tasty. Luv green curry n northern pork noodle soup. Sticky rice and nam tod are great too. Sausage avg."}
{"text":"Can't say I eat Thai food at all back in Arizona.  I can say enjoyed the cuisine maybe 5 times in my life if that.  In that respect I was excited to try something new and exciting. 
Lotus of Siam was perfect, we enjoyed several different dishes, but the Pad Thai was the best noodles I have ever had.  Now I know why everyone is always looking for this dish in AZ.  Cause its good when it is done right.  Lotus of Siam does it well and several other dishes.  I was a big fan of the duck, super crispy skin, a serious crunch to it and then the soft tender meat underneath it all.

Not really a fan of all the coconut curry stuff.  The Soup ended up being an unfinished dish on our table.  We even went mild so hot would be ridiculous, like ludicrous speed on space balls.  My belly was on fire after our dinner here.  I did need some smoothing desert and found some ice cream at my hotel to cure my stomach heat. 

I would put this on your list of must try in Vegas.  Off the strip, but worth the drive or taxi ride. Definitely was a dining experience for me that I will not forget."}
{"text":"Amazing place but not because of the decor or the location! The food is the best Thai food we have ever had. We aren't experts but know a good meal when we have one and this place definitely lived up to its reputation."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant seems to be the popular one in Vegas and I need to get my Thai fix.

The hostess quoted 30-40 minutes to be seated but we got our seat in 10 minutes.

Ordered mee krob, beef red curry and kang ka noon.  

Mee krob ($7.95): crispy, sweet (as expected) and kinda yum.  I love the citrusy orange peel.  Once in a while I crave mee krob and this helps my craving.

Beef red curry ($10.95): the curry is kinda good but the beef is hard.  

Kang ka noon ($9.95): spicy young jackfruit curry with pork.  I think I ask for level 5 out of 10 and it is very spicy.  This watered down curry is \"Thai\" spicy, not American \"spicy\" so be careful when ordering.  

Friendly, fast and attentive service.  

2.5 stars!! I have to agree with my friend Dani S.  I am from Los Angeles and we have so many options for cheaper, more authentic and yummier Thai restaurants in Hollywood.  Not impressed.

Lotus Siam is almost yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Outside the establishment, taped to the window is a sign: do not leave valuables in car. I took note, but when they had it posted again inside the restaurant, I made sure to go back and grab anything that even looked remotely interesting to the zombies that were milling about. 

Little did I know that the real robbery would occur after we got our food. 

The curry was very thin, almost water. All of the dishes came on shallow plates, five dishes later the three of us were still a bit hungry. The spicy beef salad was drenched in sweet dressing. 

I've definitely had better. They seem to be doing ok, judging by all of the celebrity photos and the fact that there were several large groups there that night. But I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype about this place which got me super curious so ended up giving it a try. Came for dinner on our last night in Vegas. We got there pretty much right when they opened at 5:30pm, and there already was a line! Good thing their restaurant is really big - after seating everyone with reservations they started seating walk ins. We didn't wait too long - probably 20 mins.

Thai iced tea ($4.95 USD)
I really liked the Thai iced tea. All the places where I've had Thai iced tea they were generally super sweet because of the condensed milk. Surprisingly, the Thai iced tea here wasn't too sweet! Strong in tea flavor but still with its nice creamy milk taste. I'm definitely a fan!

Nam Kai Tod ($8.95 USD)
This was a recommended appetizer. Crispy fried rice with pork and raw cabbage on the side. This was really interesting. I've never had deep fried fired rice - love the crunchy taste. The dish was a bit too salty for my liking, but it did balance out when you take a bite from the raw cabbage.

Crispy duck Panang ($27.95 USD)
This was my favorite dish. The crispy duck was really really good! The duck was lean, skin was crispy and thin without much white fat hanging in between the skin and meat. The duck meat was tender. The panang curry was on the sweeter end, stronger in coconut flavor - goes really well with rice. Loved this dish!

Pad Thai ($11.95 USD)
Pad Thai with chicken. There was a decent amount of chicken which was good, but overall the dish portion was small. The noodles were really thin, but I like the soft chewy texture. Flavors were on point. Tasty!

Khao Soi with beef ($10.95 USD)
The Khao Soi flavor was similar to the Panang except less coconuty. Decent amount of beef. Felt like it could use more noodles. This tasted good but it's slightly bland if you eat it on its own so make sure you add some soup in each bite to enhance the taste.
Food was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've had. It's quite expensive considering the portions are small. The Thai food is authentic and definitely above average though. Service is good too - all the staff were very knowledgeable with their menu and food items."}
{"text":"Once upon I time, in a search for off the strip greatness in Vegas I stumbled into a lovely bar (thanks to yelp).  Many returns later I asked my dependable bartender where he would go for some righteous Thai.  \"Lotus of Siam\" he replied, without hesitation.
This place now has the honor of being my 2nd favorite Thai restaurant so far.  We had the rice paper then bacon wrapped prawns for an appetizer, then I gorged myself with beef liver that was....  Superb.
Very reasonable prices, and by far the most amazing menu I've seen."}
{"text":"Oh thank you, Lotus of Siam, for being so beautiful and spicy and delicious and so very Lotus of Siam.  The Platonic ideal of Thai food and the American restaurant experience.

This is one of the best Riesling lists in, possibly, the world.  And the wines pair just gorgeously with the spicy-but-not-overpowering flavors of just about everything on the menu.

This is beautifully authentic thai with high quality ingredients.  Worth the trip off the strip.  This is some of the loveliest food in Vegas at the very best price with a stunning wine list.  

Do not leave Las Vegas without an appearance here."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and service! Parking was no problem. Had the Tofu Curry dish. Outstanding. Will definitely go back soon :)"}
{"text":"Over the years I've heard how this Vegas institution dishes out the best Thai food in the states, so of course i had to finally try it.

Going to lunch hungover was probably a mistake, but I'm guessing that makes up a large portion of their clientele any how. 

We ordered a pretty standard lineup of dishes: crispy rice and ground pork, papaya salad, and pad Thai. When asked for spice, we goofed by going 3, thinking it was 3 out of 5, not 3 out of 10 like it really was. The dishes were good, but I've had numerous better representations at Thai restaurants in LA. Maybe more spice would change that. Either way, it was good if not a little over hyped."}
{"text":"We came here while visiting Las Vegas. The outside of the restaurant is not exactly the best area but the inside is nice. They have a ton of wine here, an entire wall of wine. We made a reservation 2 weeks before after reading reviews. We ordered egg rolls first they were ok. Nothing much to the egg rolls not much taste and tasted microwaved. We ordered pad Thai combo. We paid $3 for shrimp and they gave us two shrimp. Didn't taste like anything but top ramen. We also ordered the drunken noodles also got two shrimp for extra $3. The drunken noodles were good and had a lot of broth on the plate. The garlic shrimp which are actually prawns were $30 and it was not worth it at all. Didn't have a garlic taste at all just tasted like microwaved shrimp. Overall I won't come back when in Vegas. Thai food must have taste and good noodles and we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Quality is top notch, presentation was beautiful,  flavor on point, service fantastic and awesome drink menu. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food; I eat it in every city I visit. I heard about this place years ago and visiting Las Vegas, we tried to make a reservation but no one ever answered the phone. Feeling optimistic, we took a bus to the unassuming strip mall and I had the best Thai food I've ever eaten. Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully arranged. I had red curry and my date had noodles. Everything was so good! I don't get to Vegas often but I can't wait to go back again and I'll try the garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"The best place ever for asian food. Fresh and wonderful.  Always great service. We love this place."}
{"text":"I tried the Garlic Shrimp. Much raved about on Yelp and Guy Fieri, but it was $$$ for what you get.  The lady down the street raved about this place....so to be fair I would need to go back and try other things, but my overall experience was not fulfilling.  It was crowded, and they are busy.  Ill update my review next year, Ill try it again."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place so we had to pay this restaurant a visit! We came on a Saturday evening around 5pm (they open at 5:30pm) so that we could beat the line! The outside looks kinda dingy and ehhhh..but once you step inside, it's huge!! There's a huge wine collection in the middle of the restaurant and tons of pictures with celebrities that have eaten here! We were the first to be seated since we were first in line, but they do take reservations! We had tried to call and make a reservation about a week ago, but they told us it was already full!

Crispy duck curry (~27): There's a reason this item is on everyone's list! The duck was of course crispy, great texture, and cooked perfectly. It was laid on top of the sweet, flavorful curry! Loved it! I couldn't wait to drench my rice with that curry!

Garlic prawns (~28): Another dish that is insanely popular here...and for a reason! This was my favorite dish of the night. The prawns are fried with a crunchy outer exterior and seasoned with perfectly. The meat was juicy! They also fried up the shells of the prawns making for even more crunchy goodness!

Pad See Ew (~11): We got this with chicken. The noodles were soft, but overall nothing that mind-blowing.

Crab fried rice (~15): The fried rice was good but they gave too little crab. Overall too small of a dish.

The service was also great, our waters were always filled, dishes were taken away as soon as we finished. Overall, a great thai restaurant with some interesting dishes, but prices are certainly a bit much. The portions are quite small so if you do opt for family style, make sure you account for that! Their menu is very extensive so it'd be great to try their other dishes ( like the ones from Northern Thai) next time!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food here is amazing. However, the portions are kinda small and it's a bit pricey. Unless it's a special occasion I would not frequent this place. 

There are many other Thai restaurants in town with food that's just as good with out the huge price tag. 

This place has been around a long time. It will continue to be around for a long time. 

The location of the restaurant is in an old strip mall. It's kinda of a sketchy area. Ample parking. 

Make sure to make reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"I was taken here for a belated birthday dinner. My sister, who lives in Vegas, swore that this is the best Thai food you can ever get, and with that, she booked a reservation for 4.

The place decor and the place itself is nothing special. Not the fanciest, but not the ugliest Thai place I've been to.

The food, however, is out of this world! I'm not too picky about Thai food, but I can tell Lotus of Siam knows their Thai flavors very very very well. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. My favorite dish was nam kao tod. I only ordered it because of the Yelp reviews, and I'm so glad I did!!!!! The flavors are so indescribable... I just wish the portion was bigger because the 4 of us was fighting over it, haha! The rice is crispy with a nice crunch to it and it has a sour lime taste, combined with small pieces of sausages or whatever the heck it was that made this dish so amazing.

We ordered a bunch of other things... tom yum hot pot, pad thai, soft shell crabs pad kee mao, some curry dish, fried rice, and I forgot the rest. Everything was on point and delicious! Don't be intimidated by the extensive menu... just experiment and pick something fun, I guarantee everything on the menu will satisfy!"}
{"text":"Great food. Staff ignores you. Food is good tho. Rate for the food is pretty good. Reasonable. Waiting time for your reservation is 10mins. Reasonable. Parking is good too."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Lotus of Siam. Wonderful selection and consistently solid. Make sure to have a reservation on weekend evenings, though."}
{"text":"We had to get to Lotus of Siam before leaving for the airport. I wasn't going to risk not making it in, so we got there at 5:20 (10 minutes before they open) and...

THERE WAS A HUGE LINE! Nobody told me about this! This place is so popular that people are lined up outside before it even opens. Luckily, we were able to snag a seat and enjoy a great meal.

We loved the drunked noodles and green curry with beef, but the highlight was a pork/chili dipping sauce from the \"Northern Thailand\" page of the menu. This dish was incredibly flavorful and different from any other Asian food I have ever tried (and I live in Chinatown, Philadelphia). The other items were very good, but didn't stand out as much.

What did stand out was the great service. The waitstaff was busy, organized, polite and helpful. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Okay, so don't get me wrong, their food was good. But disappointing and very overpriced. I probably would eat their again because it's just not worth the rave. I had higher expectations because Anthony Bourdain suggested it, but it's just not that great. I'm from Minnesota and we have so many options for authentic Asian food. I've had better for half the price."}
{"text":"This place is a true \"hidden\" gem off of the strip. It's very popular and well-known amongst foodies, as well as all of my taxi cab drivers! As soon as I said the address, they were like \"Lotus of Siam? Best Thai food you'll ever eat!\"

I made a reservation 3 weeks ago since I had a party of 10 and they do require a credit card to hold your spot. I was a little iffy but decided to oblige since I heard this place was THAT good.

I got a Thai iced tea as a drink and it was perfect - not too sweet. I ordered the tom yum soup with shrimp to start. Wow this was SPICY. I have a very, very high spice tolerance and this was actually spicy to me for once. It was delicious though!

As my entree, I got my staple drunken noodles with seafood. Boy... These were good - during my meal and as cold leftovers!

My other friends ordered the crispy duck with noodles (highly recommended!!), pad Thai, pad see ew, etc. and they all seemed to enjoy it.

Service was attentive and food was excellent beyond belief!

Note: they only accept 4 credit cards max. This was a big problem in my 10 party group."}
{"text":"I've heard about how this is the \"best thai restaurant in America\".  Its a very good one, but I really didn't notice the big difference between it and Renu Nakorn which was at a time related to Lotus of Siam. Service was very good though...its a very solid thai restaurant, but it didn't knock my socks off like others have said..I believe this review would suffer from unrealistically high expectations."}
{"text":"The menu is very adventurous at Lotus of Siam but I didn't explore outside of my usual \"Thai\" dinner.  Pad thai noodle consistency was near perfect but definitely over-seasoned for my taste.  Mango and sticky rice was fantastic, pineapple curry fried rice was nice.  The rest of our table enjoyed a crispy pompano, shrimp curry, crab fried rice and crispy tofu.  They are definitely busy but service still managed to be decent.  Considering the very high ratings for this restaurant, I can't help but feel I may have missed whatever it is that makes it a five star winner."}
{"text":"SOLID FOUR STARS. 

We had the crispy duck in penang curry and the soft shell crab noodles (both Yelp recommendations).  Both were awesome!!

We like it so much we had dinner there again 2 nights later!!

One tip is to get there early (when they open).  We got there at 5:30 and didn't have a wait for our party of four.  By the time we were leaving the waiting area was full...

This place has ruined me for other Thai places.  It will be the place I will compare ALL other Thai food to!"}
{"text":"The short answer is we heard about this place and walked from the strip to the restaurant.  We go there right before they opened so they ask us to sit inside, gave us menus and water, but we had to wait for them to open.  this kind of service happened the rest of our visit, and the food was worth the walk, and we will do it again."}
{"text":"Food amazing, staff amazing, just make reservations that's a rec if you don't want to wait 
Yummy to my tummy authentic food"}
{"text":"The parking lot is shady it looks small from outside but the inside is large...and busy. The coconut soup is really good...if you ask for spicy you'll get spicy. The papaya salad is wonderful. But did I say spicy....!!! Wow!!! I ordered the green curry with tofu I have to say      It is amazing...hands down the best Thai food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great thai place! The wait wasnt too bad. The location is not as shady as some people might think as this is a mom&pop looking place. 

I loved the extensive wine list. Try the auslese if you like sweet wine that is not necessarily dessert wine. 

The best panang curry ive had yet. Portion sizes were good, not too small for price and not too much where youd have to take home. 

Our server wasnt the greatest though. Was not attentive at all. He took forever on everything and i had to wave my hand to get his attention. There were times when he wasnt to be found and others had to pick up his slack."}
{"text":"The hype is real. I just went here with my parents and we were not disappointed! Wait was long as always, even for a Sunday night at 850pm. However, we got seated at the bar and ordered our drinks first. Thai teas all around of course! Service is pretty darn good here, they sat us down and made sure we got our orders in quickly. Things I would recommend ordering:

1) Crispy duck Penang curry (pricey at $24/dish) the skin is so crispy and the duck is cooked to perfection. I personally think the curry is too creamy but for those that love a coconut base curry, this is a must for you! 
2) Garlic prawns - gahhh damn it's good. They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. 
3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour. 
4) Pad Thai - pretty good, but not their best dish. But I think it's cuz the other dishes I can't get else where as good! 

Wish they would expand and bring this to SoCal! But this place is a must for every Vegas trip. Bill came out to be 85 including tip! Pretty good for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"don't confuse fancy restaurant decor with good food. lotus siam was a big let down. 

from soup, to salad, to entrees, every dish was HEAVILY salted. the beef eggplant salad had a few chunks of fat, so before you take a bite of the eggplant, make sure it's eggplant. 

such a big disappointment. i was really looking forward to dining at lotus siam, but after tonight's experience, i will never return. 

the only stars this restaurant deserves are for the excellent service (host and wait staff.)"}
{"text":"Must try the Nam Koa Tod (#14). by far the best thing we had there, and better than the \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" pork dip dish. It's crunchy, spicy, sweet, and every bite gives you a different flavor profile. All the food looked great, but duck with drunken noodles was a 10 as well. Hidden gem and a great reason to get off the Strip."}

Already the rare recipient of a Las Vegas Beard Award, Chef Saipin Chutima named Best Chef: Southwest in 2011, Lotus of Siam was recently nominated as a semi-finalist for Best Restaurant, a surprising recognition that occurred in the two-weeks between making a reservation for twelve and the actual 5:30pm Saturday that the group sat down for the meal.

Having visited the unassuming icon of Thai food that rose to national attention in the mid-2000s only once prior, a lunch reconnecting with a local restaurant General Manager and his girlfriend at Christmas 2012 seeing a limited number of plates amidst a dining room that was completely packed, arrival prior to opening over four years later saw a line for walk-ins of 30+ circumvented by a simple phone-call and credit card on-hold, the group seated promptly at a lengthy table with water soon poured and a Wine list offered.

Having performed due-diligence this time, the sizable menu navigated beforehand with a choice of ten different plates in orders of one or two, depending on portion, it was after a brief exchange with the server that a hand-written list was annotated to spice-level five with requests for a slow roll-out, the plan originally going smoothly but soon deteriorating into a flood of plates that saw several miss out on various dishes as they circulated the table.

More pricey than Thai anywhere else in town, though the ingredient quality is undeniably high, it was at a Hot Pot of Tom Kha Gai spewing fire that all gazed as it was presented near room's center, the smooth flavor of Coconut and boiled Chicken blending with Lemongrass and light heat an elegant way to start while the Northern dip of Green Chilies was little more than a tiny portion of Salsa crafted primarily from roasted Jalapenos, several Garlic Cloves and Sesame.

Watched over by photographss of famous folks who'd stopped in, everyone from Joe Montana to past-Presidents smiling and signed behind glass, plates of Sour Isaan Sausage and Nam Kao Tod trailed the Soup and Dip by approximately fifteen minutes, two orders of the former enough to offer a small slice of snappy Meat with a deep, yet pleasant, funkiness to everyone while the latter was a great suggestion from someone who's visited the restaurant frequently, slices of Cabbage and Peanuts served alongside a deep-fried Rice Ball studded with Pork amidst earthy aromatics and the unmistakable flavor of Fish Sauce.

At this point only 5:55pm, the restaurant completely full and two-deep at the bar with a line still snaking from the door, a flurry of servers soon saw the table packed with two plates of Drunken Noodles, a small mound of Spicy Rice plus filleted Catfish in Basil and Crispy Duck with Panang Curry, the fried rice no different than that at any Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Road and thus no more compelling than a steamer of the white stuff while the Pad Kee Mao was oily and not particularly flavorful beyond the Soy and Fish Sauce, an upcharge of $27.95 for Duck compared to the $12.95 Chicken really not justified as the flavor of each was drowned out.

Impressed by the meaty Catfish, though a whole-animal preparation would have been more price-appropriate than the small filets of a fish that is generally quite cheap, Duck in Panang Curry righted many of the faults found in the other dishes with great crispiness and rosy flesh amidst the robust sauce of Coconut, Peppers plus light notes of Sugar and Citrus that was so good that it commanded a second plate.

Rounding out the evening by 6:40, the staff vigorously working to turn the table, Northern dishes of Kang Hoh and Kang Ka Noon each furthered the rumor that LoS's best plates are found on the back page of the menu, the Dry Pork Curry a spicy little number with big fermented flavors while the crunchy rounds of Jack Fruit were not dissimilar from Artichokes in taste or texture amidst a vibrant, acidic Curry that was good on its own and even better when mellowed by the White Rice used to sop it up.

***  Exiting Lotus of Siam at $30/each after Tax and 18% Gratuity, not accounting for those who chose to drink wine, it would be hard to say that anyone had eaten their fill while some actually reached out to say they did not even have a chance to sample several of the plates, a combination of rushed service and small portions paired with some truly average dishes leaving me in no rush to return before delving further into Las Vegas' less-famous Thai places."}
{"text":"This place truly lived up to its reputation. Friendly service, great lively vibe and delicious food. This was the best crispy fish with basil and chili I have had outside of Thailand. Nothing in NYC has come close.  Northern style curry also superb, very aromatic. Impressive wine list with reasonable prices. I would have eaten there twice if I had more time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Make a reservation, make a reservation, make a reservation! Otherwise you'll need to wait in the heat! This place has thousands to reviews for a reason--they are a legend and thankfully, live up to their reputation. Service is quick, food is consistently good and reliable, and air conditioning is on full blast. As everyone mentions, don't pass up on the garlic shrimp or crispy duck panang. I've had the crispy duck twice and can still remember the first bite of each!! Dishes are a little pricier than I'd expect, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian/vegan options. I always have to adjust my order to fit my dietary needs and then pray it comes out correctly. My suggestion is to walk across the parking lot to Komol Thai, way better and more bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I don't understand where all the 4 to 5 stars are basing their taste buds on. When I first walked in, I could smell the musky coach roach scent in the air. I have the nose of a K9. Then the man who showed me to the table was rude. Maybe because I am also Asian and he thought I not worthy. He showed me the table and stopped me in mid stride as I was walking to it so that he could walk there first. Utterly ridiculous. 

I always ordered my Pad Thai with less sweet because most places dump a bucket load of sugar into this dish. No exception here. I specifically asked for less sugar but it came out a lot sweeter than I had asked. I just don't get it. Most other dishes I ordered are too sweet for my preference.

When we were done and the waiter was not around, I went up to the cashier to pay. The young cashier girl told me to go back because apparently only the waiter could give me my check. House rules? Are they trying to run it like a 5 stars restaurant when the  smell of roaches waft in the air and foods are subpar at best? To add insult to injury, they tagged on 18% gratuity. Gratuity should never be mandatory. If they want to make it mandatory at the very least, treat their customers better. Needless to say, this is my first and last visit. If there's a zero star or less, I would give it that.

I'm from LA where even the mid tier Thai restaurants are head and shoulders above this place. Pass this place if you're thinking of Thai food. You deserve better foods and better service."}
{"text":"Located in a tiny strip mall, not even facing the street! Looks so dinky from the outside, so I was so surprised to see how bustling and large it was on the inside. 

Wait time can be around 2 hours, so try to come on an off time or near closing. We came around 9:30, when their last seating is at 10, and were seated right away. I called at 8 the same day, and the wait time was 1.5 hours. 

It's known by celebrity chefs as \"the best Thai restaurant in America.\" Their menu is extensive, it probably has at least 100 items of main courses. I love that they include northern Thai dishes, such as Khao Soi, which is so difficult to find near me. So don't get Pad Thai here -- try something new!

The 2 dishes people rave about here are their Crispy Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck Panang Curry. These were under \"Chef's Choice,\" and cost around $30. Pricy. Everything else was a more reasonable $10ish. 

I would not order the prawns again. They're basically just really crispy prawns, and I'm not sure what the hype around it is. 

The crispy duck, on the other hand, is the best duck I've ever had. And being an Asian American, I've had my fair share of duck. Crispy skin, moist meat. How do they do it?? Even Anthony Bourdain (or was it Andrew Zimmerman??) was in awe of how they cooked it. He said something along the lines of \"2 top chefs with over 50 years of experience between them can't figure it out.\" 

I was sharing the crispy duck dish with my boyfriend, and sometimes we will fight over the good pieces (jokingly, of course). This time, I intentionally chose the worst piece just to see... and it was STILL AMAZING. 

I will DEFINITELY be back to try the other dishes! I wish I had the stomach to try more!! Or I wish I didn't order the prawns, so I could try 3 other plates.....lol regrets"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place!!! And their fried tofu app yummmm. I'm from Arizona an my boyfriend and I love it here when we come to Vegas no other thai place compares to this spot. This trip how ever they are closed till 5:30 (Sunday) so we won't be able to eat here our flight leaves soon. But we will be back. With big appetites !"}
{"text":"We had to wait at the bar for about an hour to get a table for 4 at 7pm on Friday. We ordered northern larb, cashew nut chicken, spicy rice and sea food mix noodle. The cashew nut chicken is to die for !! Super great!! Over all the food was great !"}
{"text":"Ugh I hate not giving at least a 4 star to a place as legendary as LOS. Perhaps it's because of too high expectations going in again and I've been looking forward to this place for weeks before my Vegas trip. We were dirty and running late after a hike in Red Rocks and booked it across town to make it here before they close for lunch.

Crispy duck in Panang curry - The duck was cooked really well and there was not a bone in site, unlike a majority of duck curries I've had in my life. The Panang curry was also quite tasty. However despite the good portion of duck, I thought $26 bucks or something was a bit overpriced.

Khao soi with beef - The cheapest but actually over favorite dish of the day. Flavor of the soup was incredibly rich and complex, and I really liked the slightly chewy texture of the egg noodles.

Garlic prawns - The most disappointing dish... The prawns are ginormous for sure, definitely why this dish costs nearly 30 bucks. The prawns are deshelled and both the shell and the meat are fried. The prawns themselves were very tasty though teetering on the edge of being overcooked. The shells, however, I found to be not crispy enough. They were certainly fried through and through, but I think it's a factor of the size of the prawn. When they get this big, the shells just simply get too thick and tough. To be honest, I rather have smaller prawns and a crispier shell than this.

Don't get me wrong, we still had a really delicious lunch here, but I'm just mostly saddened but the dish I was looking forward the most to didn't live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Some friends are in town for a convention and they ask me to redeem myself by picking a good place to eat for dinner. GOOD they emphasized. (Note: See my previous post about the Bellagio Buffet) Oh, and they wanted someplace off the strip thats not a chain restaurant. Oh boy. Fun!

I log onto Yelp to check out some options. Immediately I see my HUGE A$$ Pancake picture and suggest Hash House A Go Go. Its pretty tasty there. I was then told that someone in the group didnt want to see humongous portions anymore. Huh? What? Really? I dont think I've ever heard that before.

So I go on searching for the perfect place and there it was... Staring blatantly at me right smack dab on the front page. No other than the Review of the Day! The place? Lotus of Siam! Voted the Best Thai food in America by Gourmet Magazine has to mean something... right?

I jump on my cell and immediately call the restaurant. I know they are always packed and require a day in advance reservations. The nice gentleman on the phone tells me that they are allowing walk ins tonight and its a first come first served basis. I figure for a Wednesday night, it cant be that busy.... Can it? 

My friends leave from the Venetian and I leave from my house. I get a call about 10 minutes later.

\"Leo, are you sure its Lotus of Siam?\"
\"Yes, why?\"
\"Its not in the nicest of areas. Its in a strip mall and its surrounded by \"massage parlors\" and such. Is it really that good?\"

Feeling like they were in an episode of Punk'd, I assured them that the food is outstanding. I also jokingly told them not to leave any valuables in the car and to keep a close eye on their purse/pockets. Of course you know there's always a little truth in every joke.

So I pull up around 7:30 and notice a few parties waiting outside the door. I see my friends and they said we're 4th on the list. Not to bad I guess. We wait a good 30 minutes and finally get seated. A couple that had been waiting there before us snickered at us since we got seated before them. I guess I would feel the same way too after smelling all that yummy food.

Lets get to the important stuff. THE FOOD!

GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS. Oh my God. This is delicious. Light crispy skin with honey garlic spicy sauce. Wow. This dish was good. You get about 7-8 wings per order.

NAM KAO TOD - The crispy rice and sour sausage dish was very very tasty. Lots of flavors attacking the pallet at the same time. We got a medium spicy and we felt it. The spiciness was gradually getting hotter and hotter with each bite. If you only took one bite, you'd be fine. But seriously, how can you stop after only one bite?

TOM YUM KUNG - Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass, and straw mushroom. Tasty but I dont think I would order this again with so many other soup choices on the menu.

GARLIC PRAWN - Amazing. The skin was soooo crispy, you could eat the prawn whole with skin and everything. One friend kept on eating just the skin! The prawns were huge. Normally, the medium size shrimp go about 40/45 pieces per pound. I bet these would be like 20 pieces a pound.

CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - I think this was the best dish of the night. Wow. The duck skin was definitely crispy. There were good chunks of meat under the skin as well. Definitely more than I expected. And that alone is mouth watering, but then add the Panang (Curry) and it was perfect. I would definitely without a doubt order this again.

SEA BASS OVER DRUNKEN NOODLES - The sea bass filets were seared just right and the thick (chow fun) noodles underneath were scrumptious as well. I was delightfully surprised about the large serving size.

All this food with some Thai Iced Teas and we were happy campers. Needless to say, I redeemed myself with a good pick and the party definitely had a good meal. This morning when I arrived at work, I found myself telling all my coworkers about Lotus of Siam and how AWESOME the food is. I guess I really liked it. Anyone coming to Vegas has to check this place out. And most importantly... DONT FORGET TO INVITE ME!

I hear the lunch buffet is not very good. Definitely go for dinner... and make reservations!"}
{"text":"My wife is the thai food expert, and this is the place she wanted to go for her birthday.  I found many items on the menu that I liked, that were not too hot, and I enjoyed my selections very much.  She was in heaven!  We will go back again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate at Lotus of Siam about a year ago.  In a word, the place was 'TERRIBLE'!

I regularly eat in upscale and hole in the wall Thai restaurants here in Atlanta and they all are a million times better than Lotus of Siam.  Yeah, I believed all the hype about this being the best Thai food in the country.  However, my sister and I quickly learned it was just hype.

We had the lunch buffet.  We tried every thing on the buffet (Not hard to do because there's not much on the buffet anyway) from the different currys to the chicken, and rice offerings and every thing was a huge dissapointment.  

My sister got sick on the way back to our hotel and we had to rush her to the first hotel we saw on the strip so she could go to the restroom to throw up.  I gave it one star for the cold ice water like a previous person said.

If you love good Thai food and you're used to eating good Thai food then DO NOT EAT AT LOTUS OF SIAM!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place with my bf we had to get our order to go because the sit down dinner was a 2-hr wait (no reservation) opposed to the to go wait was 45 minutes long.

It is HIGHLY recommended to make reservations to solve the wait time. AND they hold your table for a whole 5 minutes! 

So, the food, they rate their spiciness from 1-10. The first time we got curry and it was an 8. That is way too much. There were 4 or 5 different kinds of chili and the seeds. It made it difficult to enjoy the meal. The second time we came here we got a 4 and  even a 4 is good enough. Depending on your dish a 4 has some jalapeño seeds so there's a nice kick already. 

Food here is oh so good and a must when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Just came back from Vegas. Had a great meal at the new location of the Lotus Of Siam. This is always a go spot for us & i was distressed to learn about the roof. The new place is fine food is great. No liquor License but a shop a half a block away. Better to bring your own. April was our server & could not be more helpful. Telling me to add this or try this was the sign of of quality. Sa-tay's were great Deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with Thai style sweet and sour sauce was the hit. Drunken noodles also he hit. Share a desert."}
{"text":"You may get panhandled by a meth addict or two in the parking lot of neglect, but this Thai place is serious business. The menu is huge, and the food is the drug that the masses line up for. Big wine selection if you want to go all the way. Play up the spicyness scale from 1-10 if your server offers."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum Koong, Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab, Khao, Soi, Prick Thai Onn taste is excellent.  However, today must have been the worst service ever.  After getting the soup, it took 30 min of waiting for the rest of the food.  Other tables that came later than us received their food first."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I took my wife there last weekend and she loved it. I didn't."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the portions are quite small.  Ordered 2 appetizers, chicken dumplings and satay and both dishes did not have enough food for 2 people.  Also ordered pad thai, which was quite a small portion, just enough to split between 2 people and the prik king dish which ended up being mostly green beans and a few chunks of pork.  We were told the prik king was a spicy dish and we asked for extra spicy.  It was just mildly spicy.   Add a thai tea, one thai beer and a glass of wine and the total was $80.00.  Expensive.  Plus the wait was an hour."}
{"text":"Man this place is popular....is quite the understatement.  My wife and I got  there about 30 minutes prior to opening and long and behold....50 people ahead of us.  This is a brick and mortar restaurant not some weird food truck phenom.

This place is 100% legit and I have to say it will be on the itinerary every single time.  The spicy nam prik goong and the crispy shrimps and all the delicious dishes that are too many to name.   BUT get there early as there will always be a line.  Something else that kinda scared us while we were getting out of the cab was that the cabby wanted to know if we wanted him to wait?  Must be a messed up hood if the cabbies are freaked out.   Love the food though.  But don't leave stuff in your car!


Cheers and happy eats!"}
{"text":"The last time I have Thai food this good is when I was in Bangkok. Curry sauce is 6 out of 5. Holly molly gastronomically great food."}
{"text":"I'm partial to Anthony Bourdain. Fond of, even. I imagine him narrating my dishes in his poetic prose. Hearing he visited Lotus of Siam put the place in my head, and over I went with the family! It was a 40 minute wait for a table, but we were so very excited.

The menu is large. Too many choices. \"Quality over quantity,\" as it's said. I would have appreciated the server spending more time recommending traditional Northern Thai dishes, but perhaps I'll have to go when they can spare the attention. 

We ordered quite a few dishes, but not one came out at a temperature that didn't lead you to believe it was sitting in front of a fan on a hot summer day.

Spicy Chicken Wings
Issan-style Beef Jerky
Tom Yum Kai
Seared Scallops with Chili Basil Leaves
Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab
Garlic Prawns
Braised Short Rib with Panang
Crispy Duck with Panang

I don't like to request my dishes be brought back for any reason, but I find the taste of cold fried food incredibly off-putting. The prawns were the only dish I asked of. It would have felt exhausting to request every dish be reheated. And then there's the question of \"how?\" How are you warming my dish? In a microwave, or are you sparing a few precious minutes in a wok?

Business is good for Lotus of Siam thanks to the celebrity visits. Maybe with some extra funds they'll invest in better warming lamps for their dishes, or teach their chefs/runners how to better coordinate the timing sending food out. There's so much potential; I know it and I want to believe it. For this reason I'll go back and try again.

(In a perfect world of temperature-hot foods, I would definitely order the drunken noodles and garlic prawns again; everything else was uninspiring)"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've found in Las Vegas. It is in the sketchiest little strip mall I've ever seen, but once you get inside you forget all about that.

I always bring out-of-town friends here, because it's inexpensive, it's pretty quick and it's DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews about this place, there was no stopping us from visiting.  We arrived at 9:30pm, half an hour before closing on a Saturday of Labor Day Weekend.  We were seated almost immediately but the restaurant was packed with more people waiting to get in.

We ordered two dishes that everyone seems to be talking about: soft shell crab drunken noodles and garlic prawns.  The dishes came out very quick and efficient.  The drunken noodles was a disappointment because the noodles were lukewarm and clumped together.  The battered soft shell crab was warm and delicious but combine it with the noodles, it was not good.  

The crispy prawns, on the other hand, was astounding.  The garlic batter is insanely good.  The way they fry it is neat - the peel the shell off of the crab but not all the way, they leave the shell on connected at the tail and they fry the entire thing.  When it comes out, the jumbo prawns itself and the shell are fried.  You get a bit of calcium eating the shell.  

It was a 50-50 experience.  I'm sure if the noodles were hot and soft, this place would be a 4.5 to 5 star experience.  Service was good and efficient."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had in Las Vegas...or the entire United States? I know, you can get Thai food anywhere; but hear me out!

TIPS:
- Lotus of Siam is located inside a little mall so it may be hard to find given that you have to drive around in circles first looking for the entrance to the strip mall. 

FOOD:
- The Thai food here is delicious and high quality! Never thought I'd say that about Thai food, since most of your run of the mill Thai restaurants are super cheap fast food. However you can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients that Lotus of Siam uses. 
- Pad See Ew: Usually it's greasy and oily with a ton of sauce. However, the Pad See Ew at Lotus of Siam wasn't greasy at all, with the perfect balance of sauce. Furthermore the vegetables weren't bitter and tasted very sweet! 
- Tom Kah Kai Soup: Delicious but beware the chili pepper as it can get hot! However the milky coconut with the spicy soup makes for a perfect balance. 
- Papaya Salad: I'm usually not a fan of Thai papaya salad and prefer the darker Lao style since that's what I ate growing up. However the Papaya salad at Lotus of Siam is so delicious! 

OVERALL: 
- Highly recommend everyone to come eat here."}
{"text":"Deserving of the notoriety and \"hype.\"  Have been wanting to visit for some time, and finally made it.  Everything we ordered came out quickly and was delicious, full of flavor and satisfying. Wished we could have ordered more to try, but we were just too full.  Service was excellent and price was very reasonable for the quality of the food.  The new location was easy to find and very elegant."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I recommend a reservation as it will take a while if you just walk in... but it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! 

Location:
Ghetto ass shopping center that if you go at night, looks pretty docile and empty everywhere else in that area.

Food:
I had the Nam Kao Tod appetizer which was great. Good amount of food for an appetizer dish and it tasted amazing. I would order this again. For the entree I had this Pad See Ew noodle dish over grilled duck. Since I was with a bachelor party, I got to sample many noodle dishes with mine probably being the most popular. If you love duck & you love Pad See Ew, this is a MUST try! There are other duck dishes w noodles, but the Pad See Ew option was my favorite. 

Service:
We had a group of 12 or so and it worked out great. Service was fantastic and tended to us well. Everything came out in a timely manner too. I'd def recommend doing reservations here because it's that serious. If not, you'll be waiting a long time to eat.

Overall:
One of the best Thai places I've eaten at. Def would go back to try what I haven't yet, and to get another noodle dish. Prices are fair and the menu is HUGE! That was the only tough part for me since I'm so indecisive. However, being in a large group and sharing everything, it made it easier that night. Cab here from the strip isn't that pricey at all!"}
{"text":"We had beef pad thai and their special, #68 (difficult to remember spelling, kaag omm?), for 20.

- Hidden gem fail. You'd think this place would be great: delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price, bc its in some ghetto plaza, but it was far from a diamond in the roof.
- YES! when  you go inside, its beautiful. Pretty pictures, nice tables, and huge selection of wines. They even have a bar. 
- This place needs to be in downtown! Deceiving!
- I ADMIT! pad thai tasted great. but if you can finish it in literally 5 big bites for $10, NO WAY. Filler FAIL!
- 68: inedible. They put so many different spices to get the right flavor, that at when you're almost finished with it, you can't eat it bc the curry has too much spices and crap. 
- The bowl is CURRY (which to me, honestly is soup, lol, but really not bc its just without coconut milk) is about the size of a bowl of cereal or as much as you get when you make maruchan. haha
- This place should be called TAPAS of Siam!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the Buffet is GONE! Miss it! Lunch item prices should be lower, smaller portions, but it's one menu for all. Not wise. Food is always excellent. Service okay. Don't know when I'll go back. Just for dinner."}
{"text":"It's a far trek from the strip, but if you've got a car, it's definitely worth it to stop by mid-trip! I'd say...it's not worth it if you're driving/heading back home, and thus would have to suffer through traffic after lunch.

Oddly, the Tom Yum Soup came out last, and was lukewarm; however, is delicious. I also love how they ask \"how spicy\" on every single dish you order.

The Drunken Noodles, with Duck was fantastic. Classic, Pad See Ew.

They also have a lot of Northern (Burmese) dishes, which are rarely found in Thai restauarants. The only other Kao Soi I've heard being served, is in Portland, OR. And we've never seen the \"Green Chili Dip\" anywhere else.

They also have an inch thick menu of just wines! Amazing!"}
{"text":"The first time I've ever heard of Lotus of Siam was when it was featured on \"Waking Up with the Wagners\" almost a year ago.  I don't drive in certain parts of Sahara so, finding this place was a bit tricky.  

Our reservation last night was at 6pm and I heard the hostess say to one of the servers that they can't take any more reservations so, I was glad we called the night before.  When we got there, there were plenty of empty tables but sure enough, the place got busy in a matter of minutes.  The servers were scrambling and were trying to rush us.  I mean, they have a pretty huge menu (since they have dishes from different regions in Thailand) and making a quick decision wasn't that easy.

We got appetizers: nua dad deaw (beef jerky) and mee krob.  For entrees: beef panang, drunken noodle with soft-shell crab and kana moo grob (crispy pork with Chinese broccoli).  For dessert: fried banana and coconut ice cream with sticky rice.

Nua dad deaw: 
I'm not a fan of jerky but this was great.  You get about 8 pieces of beef that comes with a dipping sauce.  The jerky was flavorful so, no need for the sauce.

Mee krob:
Crispy noodles with chicken, shrimp, and sweet and sour sauce.  It was sweet and I enjoyed the crispy noodles.

Beef panang:
Tender pieces of beef with really good sauce.  The best I've had in Vegas.

Drunken noodle with soft-shell crab:
We ordered it spicy# 5 but we got about a #8.  I liked the flavor on the noodles despite the intense heat.

Kana moo grob:
I always get this at any Thai restaurant I go to.  The sauce was great, the pork was tasy and crispy and the broccoli fresh and crisp.  Again, the best I've had in Vegas.

Fried banana:
You get skinny fried rolls of fried banana with powdered sugar on top.  Nothing exciting.  I've had better.

Coconut ice cream with sticky rice:
It was ok but it would've been much better if mangoes were in season so we could've gotten mangoes with sticky rice instead.

I don't know why I waited this long to give Lotus of Siam a try but I'm glad I finally did.  Next time, I'll try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I really love Thai food and it's hard to get great Thai food! We ordered about 12 different dishes and they flew out of the kitchen even though it was packed. Great service, outstanding food (and I mean everything, you can't go wrong). And I am really particular about my Thai food!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food outside of Thailand itself.  Stick to the Northern section of the menu."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of time in San Francisco and I've got to be almost all the really bomb spots and Chinatown in downtown... This place is a world-class level... I highly recommend if you're in Vegas and want Chinese food stop by and check these guys out you won't be disappointed...Fried rice appetizer are on another level....Fried duck and shrimp drunken noodles Are a must try awesome"}
{"text":"I should have really came here at the beginning of my trip and not the end...when I was fooded out and still digesting the meal from the past 4 nights. 

AND because I'm a buffet person, I went strictly for the lunch buffet, which is NOT $7.99 anymore, but $11.99. Hello. 

Either way I did enjoy this modest lunch buffet as it offered the Thai basics of fried wings, green curry, pad thai, tom yung (?) soup and some other noodles and rice dishes. It was good but again I felt I did myself and this restaurant a disservice by hitting it up the way I did.

Next time, I will bring a lot of people so we can order ALL the specialty dishes that Lotus has won awards for. And I will do this on my first night in Vegas...not my last lunch. =( 

Pros:
-Affordable and tasty Thai buffet. Cannot find this quality or price or even a Thai buffet in Hawaii. 
-Quick and attentive service 
-Lot's of parking in this ghetto looking strip mall

Cons:
-It's in a ghetto looking strip mall yo. but that's a good thing I guess coz you know they can't pass on their \"high\" rent or \"fancy\" décor onto their customers. Or at least you hope not!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough how good this place is.  Best Thai restaurant in the world.  Seriously.  Must try the crispy garlic prawns.   Killer.   Papaya salad.  Soft shell crab.  Duck.  Lobster the list goes on.   Like always.  Make reservations or be prepared to wait hours."}
{"text":"Definitely a must return. Service, food, establishment...all great. We had friends waiting for us so we don't know how long the wait it is to be seated but I would wait how ever long it took to be seated. The green curry chicken is the best I've had and can't wait to go back and try the yellow and eventually the red with beef. My wife had the General Tsao and she orders the same dish every where they serve it. This one was hands down the best she and I have both tasted. They have an extensive menu that I'm sure will please any Thai food fan. It was a Tuesday night and the place was packed. We were there for about an hour and a half and it was non-stop. I'd recommend making a reservation. I'd heard a lot of things about this place and from the things I'd heard I just assumed it was located in Chinatown but it's on Sahara, east of the LVB. They have great Thai beer as well. The price is reasonable and the service is great. It's too bad we have been cutting back on eating out because we'd probably go through the whole menu at this place. A must try."}
{"text":"The fried shrimp and the duck curry were both yummylicious!  I usually don't go off the strip for food in Vegas but I definitely will go back when I'm in town.

I can eat a plate of fried shrimp and that duck curry all to myself (and I'm not even a duck fan).  Portions are unfortunately not that big and it is not cheap, especially for a Thai restaurant, but oh man the taste!"}
{"text":"I finally got to experience this amazing Thai cuisine. The beef salad, nam prick noom, northern style larb, and Panang curry were amazing! The restaurant was very busy I recommend coming an hour early at all times."}
{"text":"Food was to die for. Great seevice. Definitely did not expect it to be so nice in such a run down pavillion and a not so great area of town."}
{"text":"I think this place looks awesome, hope the foods taste as good as it looks! The food we ate was awesome, chili mint chicken and pad se eu. The flavor wasn't like the original place off of Sahara but it was still good. I'd encourage anyone who has eaten from the original spot to give to give his place a try!"}
{"text":"I don't have too many great things to say about my last girlfriend except that she introduced me to Lotus of Siam. I had heard for several years that many food critics claim it has the best Thai food in America, and this place definitely lives up to the hype. 

I've been a Vegas resident for over a decade and dined at almost every high-end restaurant in town, but this is easily one of my favorite spots in the city. There are something like 130 or 140 menu items to choose from and the prices are incredibly reasonable -- especially considering how popular this place is. It's not remotely fancy inside and the location is in a dirty shopping center in a bad part of town, but the food is unbelievably exceptional. 

Reservations are definitely recommended if you want to eat on a weekend evening at a preferable dining hour, but don't give up if you call ahead and the receptionist says they're booked. Simply walk in around 9-9:15 (they close at 10) and you probably won't wait for more than 20 minutes or so. Ask the receptionist and she'll tell you the same thing.

And if you're looking for some cheap after-dinner entertainment, I suggest sitting in your car for a few minutes and checking out the people coming and going from \"The Green Door\" (the supposedly world famous swingers club inside the same shopping center). The people watching from the parking lot there is almost as great as the food at Lotus of Siam. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Musamon curry with fried tofu and shrimp is amazing ! A friend who is a Thai food neophyte got the sweet and sour chicken . I was skeptical , but it was delicious , too ."}
{"text":"No trip to las vegas is complete without a trip to lotus of siam.all the food is excellent.very busy.make sure to have a reservation."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at MANY Thai restaurants, and to me this was a total disappointment. I read the other reviews on here and was eager to try this place out. The portions that they served us were small compared to other restaurants that I've been to. We had the pad Thai and one of they're curries. I thought well their portions might be small but lets give them the benefit of the doubt, all i have to say about the taste is there a dozen more restaurants that i rather eat at. I DO NOT recommend this place at all. Its extremely Americanized, if you've never eaten Thai before you'll love it. But if you have something to compare it to you'll be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've ever had! HUGE wine selection (60 pages), at 1130 there was a line of people waiting for it to open. By 12 every seat was taken. Great service, food came fast! Weird that it's in a strip mall, but keeps it quiter."}
{"text":"Duck isn't one of my favorite things to order at any restaurant because I'm generally unimpressed - French, New American, etc... It's all been underwhelming for me. So when I came to Lotus of Siam solo and only had enough stomach for one dish, I figured the Crispy Duck would be a good measure of how Lotus of Siam stacks up. 

Crispy Duck = incredible and Lotus of Siam is now on my shortlist of menus I need to explore with a group every time I'm in Vegas.

Garlic Prawns - I think frying seafood is almost always a bad idea. Deep frying these prawns with the shell is an exception

Get here."}
{"text":"Huge huge huge wine list. Something for every taste. Its the best Thai food I have ever had. Excellent Curry and the Pad Thai was perfect. First strip mall Thai place I have ever eaten at that had James Beard Awards on the wall. Its a short cab ride from the Las Vegas strip, they don't take reservations and the line was out the door. We only waited 30 miutes on a Tuesday night for a table. You should try this place if your a Thai foody"}
{"text":"One of the best thai food I've ever had!...and also the most unique variation of it! There were so many options on the menu that I have never seen on other thai menus before. The Garlic Prawns lived up to the Yelp hype! Super crispy and oh so delicious! I never really liked eating shrimp shells that much, even when they were fried in Chinese cooking, but my oh my...this was totally different. It was so crunchy that it felt like I was eating potato chips (which is exactly how they described it) SO GOOD!! I wish I didn't save this place till the last night we were here to try it, or I would have been here a couple more times before our trip was over. This place will be my first stop on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in the country! I saw truly say this because of it's sophistication and how it's evolved through the years. I went there ages ago when it was a small strip mall restaurant. This time around they got more space next door and a walk in wine cellar, really?! 

So you would imagine that the food quality would suffer it bit because of the volume of traffic, NOT A BIT! I actually found subtle hints of improved flavor profiles and a combination of natural ingredients. There's no heavy salt and powdered spices to mask the otherwise dull flavors that most places have. 

Most ethnic restaurants have the ideology of heavily spicing road kill and people would buy it. But if you really knew what it was you would puke before it got to the table. Anyway, what I mean is that you can easily mess up fish and spice, but not here. They really get it.

The menu is vast and complex for those who don't know much about Thai food, so ideally you want to go with a large group and get as much as you can to taste. 

This is also probably the only Thai restaurant in the country that I know of that has such a well selected wine list. I think I know wine but when I saw this I was shocked! Pairings from regions beyond us so you go in blind and it just works! They know their stuff and will guide you well.

So now it's an annual event during convention time to go to Lotus. I look forward to my meal next year again."}
{"text":"I have been missing out!

This place was on my bookmark list for forever now...and I made it a point with my friends that we had to check this place out. I am a huge fan of thai food and most Thai food places in OC are bleh and mediocre. I have been hearing nothing but good reviews of this place so I was super excited to check it out finally.

My friends and I came here for an early dinner on a Thursday.We came and they said it would be a 45 minute wait and they would call my cell when a table opens up. So next time I will be sure to get reservations... thankfully the wait was less than that. My friends and I decided to do family style and get some different dishes to share. We got:

-Crispy duck with cognac sauce: i LOVE duck and this dish was amazing. It was my friends and mine's favorite dish. 
-Pad thai: Best pad thai Ive ever had. very flavorful and noodles cooked just right.
-Pineapple fried rice: Delish! very flavorful and good.
-Duck green curry: Yum I love thai curry and this was really good and flavorful.
-Beef with basil: Very good but was okay in comparison to the other dishes
-Mango and sticky rice with coconut ice cream: Thai food is not complete until you get this dish. The rice had a really pretty scent and slight taste of Jasmin. The mangos were perfectly riped. So good!

For sure, going onwards I am stopping by here on every Vegas trip onwards. Food is amazing! Service was very friendly and efficient. They have a great selection of wines too. Its a bit pricey here but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"A true hidden culinary treasure... A great restaurant with beautiful facilities, very clean and friendly with fresh food. I am now eating the lunch buffet and the taste of the food is amazing! The only reason I am giving it 4 star rating is the limited number of dishes offered. Come to this place for the QUALITY of the food not the quantity. I would cerainly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my must go restaurant in Vegas.Great and authentic Thai food. Make appointment earlier ."}
{"text":"Get there early, and enjoy! There was a line at 5:30 pm. but worth the wait! We all had seafood meals and appetizers full of flavor! We all were super satisfied and  the service was awesome! We were just visiting Las Vegas and had remembered the restaurant from an Anthony Bourdain show ! Really glad we checked it out! We ended our dessert with the fried wonton bananas and coconut ice cream a wonderful companion pair!"}
{"text":"Widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country, Lotus of Siam sits in a semi-dilapidated strip mall.  But don't let the surroundings fool you.  The food here is excellent.  Saipin Chutima was nominated for best chef in the Southwest Region by the James Beard Foundation in 2008.

The classic Pad Thai is a great rendition.  The noodles aren't overcooked, and the sauce is subtle enough to let the flavor of each ingredient shine through.

The Sua Rong Hai (charbroiled beef) is a great dish.  Tender, flavorful slices of perfectly cooked beef come with sauce that is somewhat on the spicy side, but not overly so.  The sauce compliments the beef perfectly, instead of overpowering it.

The Nam-Prik-Noom (Green chili dip) comes with an assortment of vegetables along with fried pork rinds.  Although flavorful, this wasn't as spicy as I was expecting.  A little more heat would have brought an extra dimension to this dish.

The Musaman Curry is unlike anything I have ever had before.  If you are a fan of Satay and enjoy the peanut sauce that comes along with it, you will absolutely love this dish.  It is like a curried version of the peanut sauce, with roasted peanuts, potatoes, carrots, and chicken.  This is a little on the sweet side, but not cloyingly so.

The Thai Beef Salad was the best thing I had on the night.  Although relatively simple, the salad was just bursting with flavor.  An explosion of lime juice, fish sauce, and heat make every bite leaving you wanting more.  The beef is very tender and juicy.

The thing that seems to set Lotus of Siam apart from just about every other Thai restaurant is the BOLDNESS of flavor in each dish and every bite."}
{"text":"Was intrigued by the good reviews and that it has been featured on Anthony Bourdain's show! Let me state that this restaurant gets pack, so call in for reservation if possible, even on a weekday. We ordered four different dishes; chicken pad Thai, chicken dumplings, crispy fried garlic prawns and spicy chicken soup(M) all were small portions but tasted tremendous. The star of the show was the crispy fried garlic prawns. That dish alone is well worth the trip to this restaurant. Definitely a must for my next Vegas trip!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went on Yelp to find a good carpet cleaner. After finding Fresh Start and reading the reviews I decided to us them. I am so happy I did. Adolfo of Fresh Start cleaned my rugs and not only did a good job, but did a great job. I had stains on my carpet and he removed all of them. My carpet is 15ys. old and now they look like new. Adolfo and his team respect your home and are completely professional. I would recommend any who needs their carpets done to use Adolfo. I will be using them from now on. I live in Henderson, Nevada not San Fran. Ca."}
{"text":"(Devin is my boyfriend, parents are obviously my parents)

On Saturday, Devin and I took my parents to Lotus of Siam. We have been in a bowling league with most of the waitstaff for about a year now, and we've been meaning to go there. When an article about this year's James Beard award floated my way, I noticed that among the nominees, which included the Chefs from Joel Robuchon and Rick Moonen, was the Chef from Lotus of Siam. That sealed the deal; we had to go there as soon as possible.

The restaurant is easy to drive right by; there's a sign on what looks like a warehouse on Sahara, just east of the Strip. Never fear; the entrance is on the other side, and the ambiance is nice. We didn't have reservations but got in at 7PM on a Saturday night with no problem. The crowd started showing up at 8, so I would recommend reservations for a later meal.

The wine list is huge, but since I didn't know what I was planning on eating, I just ordered a beer. They have both Singha and Chang beer from Thailand. The menu is similarly huge, probably ten pages of dishes conveniently numbered so you don't have to fumble through pronunciations if you aren't used to ordering Thai food.

I started with the Tom Yum Kai soup, which is my favorite thing to eat at Thai restaurants. I asked for it hot-spicy. Heed my warning: If you're at all nervous about your heat threshold, go for medium-spicy. I love really spicy food, so I thought the soup was great. I also ordered the Spicy Catfish. It was thin filets of fish battered and fried, with a delicious sauce, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even had leftovers since we ordered so many other dishes.

Other things ordered were the stuffed chicken wings appetizer, the chicken satay with peanut sauce, and the jackfruit dish, which was, I believe, mashed jackfruit, pork, and herbs in a spicy sauce. That one was delicious, as was everything else. My Dad ordered a salmon dish, which he said was really great. I believe it because there was absolutely nothing left on his plate when he was done, and the man knows his salmon. Devin ordered the Pad Thai, which was probably the best I've ever had. The noodles were very thin compared to the rice stick noodles that are usually used for Pad Thai, and it was also hot enough to excite my spice-seeking palate, even when ordered at medium-spicy.

Then came dessert. One of my favorite things in the world is sticky rice with mango, so we ordered that. They put a dessert platter together for us that included the rice, mango, some coconut ice cream, and some fried bananas. They do their fried bananas in phyllo dough, which is something I'd never seen before, and I loved it. Do not skip dessert, even if it means taking some of your main course home like we did.

The service was excellent, and I'm not just saying that because our waiter was one of our bowling buddies. They were attentive, and when we asked to take about five different things home, they took the plates away and boxed everything separately for us. Most impressive and refreshing: My Dad asked the waiter what he should order from two choices, and the waiter honestly told him which dish he liked better (the salmon), instead of pulling the, \"Well, they're both good...\" junk that waitstaff usually gives you when you ask for a recommendation.

I thought the price was incredible considering how much food we had. Including food, drinks, dessert, and two hours of just fun eating, we walked out at less than $40 a person. Parking is convenient, abundant, and free.

I can see why people call this place the best Thai restaurant in America. It's the best one that I've been to. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a dinner on a recent trip.  This place used to be a hidden gem off strip, but with all of the press and great reviews, you probably want to get a reservation for dinner even on what seems like a quiet, midweek night.

I had the red curry for my entree, spice level 8 (out of 10).  This is the only Thai place I know not to order their spiciest in the country.  The curry is more of a sou type rather than a stew style of curry.  sampling the broth, I did't notice the spice, but when you get the veggies and the meat, THERE is the spice!

Found the service to be very attentive, food to be top notch.  If you are used to the vegas buffets and monster plates of food you can find other places around (like Hash House A Go-Go), you might be disappointed in the serving size, this is more of a healthy for you meal"}
{"text":"I finally got to eat at Lotus of Siam this weekend and very glad that I did. 

First, I recommend making a reservation or prepare to wait in the long line outside. I book a reservation in advance and we sat down once our time came up. 

My friends and I ordered a lot of food. I had the Green Curry with chicken and it was delicious. We finished our meal with the dessert combo, which included fried bananas, mango sticky rice, and coconut ice cream. It was the best ever. 

It was definitely worth coming off strip to eat here. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. I'm from Southern California and we have a lot of Asian food choice as well as a exceptional Thai restaurants. By far I have not had any tastier Thai food till I walked in this establishment. My only complaint is the open sign in front says they open at 11:30am, but they really open at 11."}
{"text":"Just had to add to the 5 star reviews. My coworkers and I found this restaurant off of yelp and thought 1300+ people cant be wrong. We didn't know what kind of area this would be located in Vegas, and it turns out this restaurant goes off the beaten path. The food is just amazing. I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants before and this makes my top 10. I have to attend a conference every year for work. My coworkers and I have agreed - this is now A MUST every trip."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdains without borders and had to try it. We ordered only from the back of the menu for their famed Northern Thai food and did not regret a single item. We ordered the Nam prik ong, Nam kao tod & the Khao soi. The nam kao tod was out of this world I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Please don't forget to make a reservation. We didn't and decided to get our food to-go for 30 minutes instead of the 1.5 hrs wait for a table.. Don't worry, in case you forget, there's a bar in the back complete with lime drink (get this!), Thai tea and coffee, and a very very extensive list of wines! Impressive.

Brought our food back to the hotel, and it was still good as ever. 
- Pad thai noodles were al dente. Thank god. I've had some pretty good pad thais in my life so this one didn't stand out too much, but it was really good.
- Fried prawns - yes! I loved that I was able to devour the whole thing - skin and all. It was a little too hard/crunchy though and felt like there was too much breading on the prawns. 
- Penang curry was just the right consistency. Not as memorable though, but it was delicious.
- Crispy rice - omg!!!! If nothing seemed memorable from above, it's because THIS is the thing to get. We got 2 portions of this and I'm SO glad we did! The flavors were out of this world - the lemongrass really shone through. Good on top of the raw cabbage.

Would go back, but maybe I would prefer to dine-in instead. But still good!"}
{"text":"Without any doubt in my mind, the best Thai food I've ever eaten. The STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS were an incredible stater. My not some brave friend ordered the COMBINATION FRIED RICE and even that simple dish was knock you out of your chair good. I had the CRISPY DUCK with CHILI and MINT, best duck ever! I will never step foot in Vegas without visiting this amazing place."}
{"text":"I went here based on a recommendation from a friend and thought this place was okay. Not in the best location, but surprisingly nice inside.

Definitely satisfied my Thai craving.

I won't be back because I still prefer Archie's (the older one) my favorite thai joint in Vegas.  ."}
{"text":"After only hearing reviews upon reviews for the past several years, we finally made our way to the infamous Lotus! We ordered the Tom Yum soup, pad thai, another soup based noodle dish (I can't remember the name of) and the garlic prawns.

The tom yum soup, slightly different flavor from what we were used to, but it was still really good. Pad thai, not the very best, yet it still ranks up there. The other noodle dish, wasn't the best, that's probably why I couldn't remember the name of it. Lastly, the star of the show, the garlic prawns! Very tasty and filling, one complaint that I do have about it was that it was a little dry and over cooked. The prawns didn't have that moist, buttery taste to it. 

It's a very busy place, if you make a reservation and you're five minutes late, you'll lose your reservation. The popularity of this place is well deserved, yet I cannot claim it was the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Yet, it is a legacy restaurant and if you're ever in Vegas, you have to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! It's a white people version of Thai foods! I've never heard of a Thai restaurant that serves brown rice! Wtf is that ish! Don't get me wrong I love brown rice but coming from a Thai/ Laos background it's weird on our food culture.My husband wanted to try it because of Anthony Bourdain talking how it's the northern Thai flavors but I feel like they make it to cater to white people after the show now.  Whatever! Bye! 

(Giving two stars because of the Thai iced coffee was good!) 
What was on the menu:
Sai qao 
Thum sum (Laos style)(seriously that wasn't Laos style at all) 
Pad see ew
Crying tiger with tamarind sauce
Chicken wings 
Tofu soup"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Break out of your Pad Thai rut and order Northern specialties like the Kao Tod appetizer - spicy sour sausage salad, and the whole catfish, charcoal grilled. Ask for the two sauces, chili-lime and tamarind. Order a glass of Riesling from their extensive collection. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! The worst location, you will feel like you might get jumped in the parking lot. =) But it is totally worth it. Make a reservation and go with a group. Order as many things as you can. It will not disappoint. My favorites are the steak salad, pad Thai and some kind of chicken (can't remember name)."}
{"text":"The hype is real at this place. It's located way off the strip in a sleepy strip mall, with an unassuming facade, but the food inside is amazing. 

The bbq ribs was delicious. The short rib khao soi was amazing, with cream curry and deliciously braised short rib. After eating the khao soi here, it's hard to go back to regular pad Thai and pad see ew now. The crispy duck in Panang curry was also very delicious. The larb salad was citrusy but among the best I've ever had. Garlic prawns definitely lives up to the accolades. We had a dipping meat sauce that was good too. Frankly we ordered a lot and I cant remember everything on the menu, except that there wasn't one dish that I didn't enjoy. I loved them all!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  If you want pa tai noodles that you can get any where don't bother trying to find this place. Order from the chefs page on the back the flavors explode your taste buds. We ordered for appetizer soft shell crab salad good flavors and nam Kao. Spicy am with excellent flavors. The sa-Tay sliced Chicken was good, nice grilled flavor. The sea bass in ginger sauce was amazing  very flavor full and wish we had more. Crispy duck Panang had nice sweet and spicy flavors. And finally the Khoa soi with sliced beef was just as good. This place is worth going off the strip for and Jim the server could not have been any better."}
{"text":"They have gone down-hill since their expansion a couple of years ago.  I used to rate them 5-stars, now it is two.

First the very positive: If you want the best and amazing flavors, this is the place.  They have their flavor profiles totally dialed in to perfection.

Now, the problems... all of the proteins (meat, chicken, etc.) are too over cooked.  Bad texture and chewy.  The other problem is their \"heat scale\".   I have ordered food to be medium, and it can be all over the scale from barely spicy, to so intense it is inedible.

The last experience we had last week delivered the flavors to perfection, but our proteins were way overcooked, and we had a salad that was inedible because it was extremely over-saturated with pepper heat, even though we ordered it medium.

I had been going their for over 10 years.  Last week was my last time.  It is so sad.  I used to love this food.   Now I cannot eat it."}
{"text":"Really great food and an amazing wine selection. The only downside was location, which was in a questionable strip mall."}
{"text":"Worth the hour wait. You will not be disappointed. Everything tasted phenomenal! The one tiny draw back is that it doesn't have a full bar."}
{"text":"They apparently recently had some repair issues and are shut down for some time. Unfortunately we had made reservations nearly a month in advance, people coming in out of town, and not only was there zero notification by the establishment to us, but they clearly have a system to text reminders, because I got a confirmation yesterday afternoon, just hours before my reservation confirming.

We showed up, it was closed. Incredibly frustrating and embarrassing with our guests. Simple oversight that could have prevented several unhappy potential guests and a bad review."}
{"text":"Fresh from Bangkok where street food is King (Soi n. 38 & Yaowarat Road/ Thanon Charoen Krung were my haunts), i was starving for Thai intricately layered flavors.
Lotus of Siam has been on my to go list for ions : lunchtime it is : no wait, not loud, easy parking in this aging shopping center.
Lotus of Siam is a Pearl.
Chose the gloriously celebrated Garlic Shrimps : huge size, each tail holding the crisp shell and the tender meat separately : exquisitely flavored, fantastic combination of textures.
Steak tartare issan style: being of french origin, steak tartare holds a strong attraction when listed in a reputable table menu.
Small super lean  prime beef(no fat whatsoever) chopped delicately in amazingly equal 1/4 inch dice with red onion, green onion, cilantro, mint, and lime thai dressing with heat to your taste... Scrumptiously refreshing heat! Not a morsel left.

Photos of famous intlly known chefs chefs adorn the walls, a rather impressive cellar is glassed in for all diners of all ethnicities to see. Bonus: they have 3 types of Nigori Sake ;)

Sticky Rice and Mango yo close my culinary flash back

Food arrived hot and very timely.
Efficient friendly wait staff

It's all good, and now i can share my taste and invite friends and family  not to miss out once back in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What a wonderful discovery!  Thanks Ming Tsai for telling the world that the best thing you've ever eaten in Las Vegas is the Nam Prik Ong from Lotus of Siam.  I just had to try what the heck this man was talking about! My husband says Lotus of Siam is legendary in town. Well, I hadn't heard of it until Ming Tsai. 

Located in the not so flattering neighborhood of Las Vegas, I was surprised at how many patrons were there at 2pm! We were doing late lunch and was hoping to scarf as much by closing time at 2:30. I was intrigued to find that people were still filing in at this time.  

The waiting area is compact and uncomfortable.  We waited about ten minutes until our party was called. We found the restaurant busy and bustling when we were finally seated.  The restaurant has space in contrast to the narrow entrance and waiting area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an entire wall of wine in what seemed to be a temperature controlled cellar.  There was a lunch buffet which we did not care for at that time.

Our server was nice and friendly and guessed correctly at my reason for ordering Nam Prik Ong.  Needless to say, I had the Nam Prik Ong while my buddy ordered Khao Soi (egg noodles in curry coconut sauce with bits of chicken). 

Verdict: Ming Tsai must have not had a lot of opportunity to eat in town.  Nam Prik Ong was good, but I wouldn't call it the best thing I've ever eaten in Las Vegas! I have to admit it is unique and I will probably not see this dish on the menu of any other Thai restaurant.  The Khao Soi was good too.  Based on the two orders we had, did I have a ridiculously spectacular dining experience? The answer is, eh. The size of the menu however allows for Thai food education that your favorite Thai delivery place will most likely not provide."}
{"text":"I really like Thai food and Lotus has some of the best I've had.  The key here is to order off the specialty menu, I love the Issan Sausage, The Tom Kah Kai Soup, and the Thai Green Curry.  The only reason this is not a 5 star review is three words: location , location, location! That strip mall is scary!!! and as a wheelchair user, it is very difficult to get into the building itself."}
{"text":"First time there, Las Vegas local and not impressed. Ordered three dishes; crispy rice was over salted, chicken dumplings were not crisp and flavorless, Pad Thai was chewy and over spiced. Portions are small. Not sure if it's the move or what. Management handled complaint well, after the third dish I brought the issues to their attention. The staff is attentive - bartendress is good. No alcohol at the new location yet. That said we will not be back."}
{"text":"Its all about the lunch buffet. Seems like ordering off the menu can get you into some pricey areas. The lunch buffet is definatly worth going to...the food is fresh and cooked with care. The selection on the buffet isnt exactly huge, but its certainly enough for lunch. I would go here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Great thai place but can be pricey small portion! Best dish to try is roast duck panang curry, no regret!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times over the last couple years.  I love fried rice, I love duck, I really enjoy the Tom yum Soup.  

It's really crowded.....   You know the old one line  \"No one goes there any more, it's too crowded\"    If you come to Vegas and you like Thai food you need to try Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"After eating here the first time in Oct, I was really looking forward to the meal.   

I came for lunch and the waiter talked me into trying their buffet lunch.     It had salad, Tom Yum Cabbage Soup, egg soup, egg rolls, tofu and veg, green curry chicken, white and fried rice, tempura veg, pad thai, pad see ew, fried banana, and fruit.      All the delicious thai flavors were dumbed down and muted.   

2nd chance.  Failed!   Went back for dinner to have the Garlic Shrimp that blew my mind last time.   The first time shells were crunchy like shrimp chips, meat was lightly fried, moist, and delicious.   This time dried out and tough, it was so bad I sent it back.   The waiter brought it back out and said it was supposed to be that way.  (Gross!). On a good note the steak tartare was very tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food, recognized by a lot of famous people. 
Lotus of Siam made the best pad thai I've had my entire life. The flavors were incredible, and the noodles were perfect. I can't go back to another Thai restaurant and expect the same from them anymore. 
The only thing is, they do get very busy (because they're well known), but trust me. IT IS SO WORTH THE WAIT!!
You know I'll be coming back. It's a shame how far I live from them!"}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation from others and we were not disappointed - it was a winner!
We could not get a reservation but showed up when it opened.  We were worried because there was a line of people waiting to get in but we were sat fairly quickly.

Service was spot on and the food was delectable.  We had Tom Kah soup, Pad Thai, Pad See ew, and Fried Bananas for dessert.  Would recommend all of it highly."}
{"text":"Friendly and service, but food was just ok.  I grew up eating a lot of Thai food and I eat Thai food very often so I feel that I have a solid grasp on what authentic Thai food should be like. One of the dishes we ordered was the garlic prawn. It looked very impressive in the pictures, but flavor wise it fell short.  It tasted similar to the house special lobster at Boston lobster and Newport seafood but nowhere near as flavorful.  For $30, I probably only got 6 or 7 pieces. The bulk of the dish consisted of empty shells.  The second dish we ordered was khao soi. 
It had an odd taste and came with chicken breast instead of drumstick which I'm used to getting at every other place I order this dish at.  

Pros: plenty of parking, no wait, fast service"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place and I even recommended it to others although I never tried it. The first time my husband and I attempted to eat here we were sent away. We arrived exactly five minutes after they had closed to prepare for dinner. I was so disappointed as I had finally had a chance to taste their food but couldn't. My husband and I ended up checking out another Thai place called Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert in the same complex a few feet away. I was skeptical but I ended up loving it. I came back here today only because Arawan was closed and immediately regretted it. Their service was horrible, their food was okay not great and the whole experience was horrible. When I dine out I expect a great atmosphere, great customer service and amazing food.  My husband and I were seated and rushed through our lunch. It felt as if they wanted us out fast. We barely had time to have a decent conversation before our server came by and just left a check. We weren't asked how we were doing or how the food tasted. A friendly server with a smile would have made the difference between us coming back or not. If you want a great experience and amazing Thai food check out Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert just a few steps away. Eat here if you want decent food, will finish your food fast and don't want to converse with your server."}
{"text":"This is one tricky place to review.  The force (of hype) is strong with this one, and while it's almost always a good meal when I visit, it also almost always fails to meet my lofty expectations.  Is that something to hold against a restaurant?   If it's supposed to be one of the best in Las Vegas but turns out to just be yet another great Thai restaurant?  Maybe I should just get to the point and start talking about the food:

Been here several times, and almost each time I tried something different because unlike several people I know I AM NOT A SLAVE TO PARTICULAR DISHES.  Here's a list of what I can remember having and thoughts on each.  None of the appetizers I've had (Koong Sarong, prawns wrapped in bacon and deep fried / Mee Krob - crispy noodles with chicken and shrimp /  Nam Kao Tod - see all other reviews ) have blown my mind, but all were decent.  I don't really get the hoopla over the Nam Kao Tod.  Have none of ya'll ever had rice krispies before or something?   

I've done a few of the soups and those were good.   Be careful on ordering those with heavy spice.  I swear one time I asked for a 5 /10 on some Tom Yum Kung and nearly passed out from dehydration after 3 sips.  Another time I got the Seafood Soup at a 7/10 and barely touched my water.  SHRUG.   Taste was fine on both, nothing to put it above and beyond any other Thai restaurants I've had.

Salads I've tried include the Spicy Squid Salad (VERY hot @  7/10), and I liked that one a lot.  One thing I'll say is the ingredients always seem fresh which stands out in uncooked dishes like the salads.  I absolutely disliked the Spicy Shrimp Salad.  Whatever makes up their \"secret sauce\" simply has a flavor I do not enjoy, and it was DRENCHED with this.  No more secrets for me Saipin!  I'm onto you.  I also have had the Catfish Salad and Soft Shell Crab Salad.   Both of these were good, but ultimately not worth the cost.   One thing I should note is that I generally HATE salads, so maybe I should stop ordering them and talking about them in reviews.

For standard entrees I've mostly stuck with their Curries and have never been disappointed in any of them.   None have been made me completely forgo the competition around Las Vegas but they certainly rank among the best I've had.

At this rate all I've described would normally lead me to give a place a 3, but what makes me give it an end result of 4 is one thing and one thing only:  SEA BASS WITH DRUNKEN NOODLES.   FFS it's $29 but it's worth every penny and then some.  Just a spectacular dish that alone is worth 5 stars and would make me bump any review up a star.   Yes even the Post Office on Pebble and Bermuda."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 stars. 

It's certainly unfair for me to rate a restaurant that has been called \"The Best Thai Restaurant in the Nation\" when I've only eaten at four Thai restaurants in my life. 

But it was an interesting experience.

I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food but their dishes were very spicy. Duh, right?

Nam Kao Tod - I never had deep fried that wasn't burned, but they had it. It was the most memorable dish that we had out of the five we ordered. 

Sea Bass Drunken Noodles - quite good

Reminder: Their version of spicy is not the same as yours. Be careful when ordering.

The reason I'm rating them with 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food (while good) wasn't memorable enough for us. The service was also laid back, especially when we weren't knowledgeable with the food. If you need someone to refill your water (AND YOU WILL), you will have stand up and wave them down in order to get their attention.

I can't say that the GF and I will be back, but it probably was the best Thai I've had. It's too bad we really couldn't tell that it was."}
{"text":"All the reviews are right.  The garlic shrimp is excellent. The duck with penang curry is amazing. Driving by you would think nothing of this place. Its so plain outside.  If i didnt know i would have thought this place was closed.  It's a definite stop when you go to vegas.  i have found my go to spot in Vegas for thai.  What a lucky find, if only this was the casino"}
{"text":"I finally made it to the place that so many speak of! I've constantly heard how wonderful this restaurant is and now I can say I've been there. I had:

SPICY SLICED BEEF with Thai Round Eggplant- (heat level 5) tangy, spicy, fresh and delectable. The slices of eggplant were similar to the taste of horseradish, which accented the smokey charred beef nicely.

KOONG TENN- grilled shrimp covered in spices on a bed of cabbage. The shrimp were delicately cooked, with no signs of toughness. The chilies and spices that topped each shrimp were spicy and flavorful. The cabbage was a nice extinguisher to put out the fire in my mouth. 

PAD SE-EW- flat rice noodles with egg, broccoli and chicken in dark soy sauce. This is my standard order at any Thai place and their version didn't disappoint. 

I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the service. The wait staff were nice enough, it was the food that took forever to come out. We arrived at 8pm and didn't get 2 out of the 3 dishes until 9:30. I know that they are busy because they are so popular, but I still couldn't give them 5 stars when we had to sit and wait as long as we did."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The only complaint I had is the shrimp in my sum yum soup still had the \"poop\" veins.  The Mango and sticky rice dessert was great! The carpet needs cleaning. The strip mall location is a bit odd.  Give it a try you will be delighted."}
{"text":"I don't eat much Thai food.. came here purely because of the hype from online reviews, and realizing I've never been to a Thai restaurant with such acclaim.  Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.

Fresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts. 

One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered \"medium\" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here. 

Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a few days for a conference. I came here because of a recommendation by a fellow conference attendee and boy, am I glad I did! This is far and away, the best damn Thai food that I have ever had! I started with an appetizer that was a green chile dip with crushed tomatoes and cilantro with fresh vegetables to dip. It was amazing! For an entrée, I had crispy duck over Penang curry. It was pure perfection. It came with some white rice and was the perfect serving size. I would come here again without hesitation. Further, I would urge anyone who likes Thai food who happens to be in Las Vegas to visit this place immediately. It is a must."}
{"text":"We went there again. Arrived at 6 pm. No line! Great food at great price. The best Rioja that I had drink in the States. Right temp, excellent! $25.00. Amazing."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back to this place when I'll go in LV again. Everything was delicious but the garlic prawns at the end (we took them as a desert lol) were outstanding! Note that the place opens about 5:30pm and make sure you are there 20min/half hour in advance to get to the first seating. Yes it is crowded!"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is one of our favorites near the strip.

It's a little out of the way and the area may steer you away but the food and service is well worth it.

We have been impressed by every item that we've tried and often recommend this restaurant to friends visiting out of town."}
{"text":"My hands down favorite restaurant in Las Vegas... EVER!!!! I am more of a steakhouse kinda gal but Lotus steals my heart as my all time favorite. From the salmon panang, the cognac curry duck (special menu)  to even the wine list. Only downfall is now that foodies got wind you will have to make reservations for dinner no matter what night of the week. Good for them!"}
{"text":"Best Damn thai food i have ever had. The place is a trip. When you first walk in you assume the place is small due to the waiting room, once you squeeze through and make your way to the bar its like walking on to a football field. The bar is very chill, but a hassle due to limited space. The people can be quite rude knocking you over or walking through you to get your seat. Before i could get up a woman knocked my beer out my hand to get my open seat once i received the text message my table was ready, looked at me awkwardly like i was in the wrong didnt offer me another beer.  Food hands down was the best i ever had. Do expect to wait but all entirely worth it"}
{"text":"Get off the strip.
Get in a cab.
Go to Lotus of Siam.  Expect to have really bad customer service when you first arrive. They won't even acknowledge you until they are ready to see you as a customer. Once that happens.... the switch gets turned and you are their best friend.... the service is good, the food is great. Gourmet magazine said it was the best Thai in North America. That's a pretty high bar to set for a restaurant in one of the sleaziest neighborhoods in NV. The cab driver told us  how dangerous the area is... remincing about who was shot where... ah... the good times... 
Anyway...Seriously... Worth a trip to Las Vegas just for this place. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food for the price, go for all you can eat lunch, it can not be beat, I believe it was around $12 total and the pad thai was delicious. Great atmosphere because it is really busy. I recommend this establishment if you are visiting Las Vegas and are looking for great Thai Food."}
{"text":"Unbelievably tasty Thai food. Enormous menu which makes choosing just a few dishes extremely difficult. Lots of seating, always busy, food absolutely flies out of the kitchen in no time. Service was very friendly and professional. I go to Vegas a lot and will reserve for dinner every time I'm in town going forward. It lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"We were here last night. Restaurant is located in a very sketchy strip mall. For a weeknight, the place was packed so you would think the food was good. The spice of choice was salt, and lots of it. The tom yum koong and green curry chicken were fine. Tasted similar to other restaurants. The crab fried rice was tasty but not enough crab. The crispy duck curry was good, and actually crispy. We had two types of papaya salad. I don't know the name but one was Thai style and the other was Laos style? Regardless, both not good. One of them had some type of ocean critter and it was so salty, it was like eating right out of the ocean. But whatever that ocean critter was, I never want to eat it again. Justnotmything. The garlic prawns would have been good but waytoosalty. Finally, the yum woon sen salad took forever and also way too salty. They never refilled the hot tea. By the end of the night, my mouth was tingly from the sodium overload. Not to mention a very expensive meal. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This place gets packed AF as soon as it opens so come a little before it opens to get seated or else you will be waiting. I've come here for both lunch and dinner on multiple occasions during one vegas trip. That good that I came back more than once for it. The Waitress recognized us as the end. Not sure if sad or impressive. 

Duck Khao Soi - crispy duck over bed of noodles- I don't know what is in this sauce but it has to be crack. The sauce goes well with ANYTHING. By the end I was pouring it on all the things!!!! Drink it straight up!

Garlic black pepper chicken wing- these were average and on the drier side- I would not get these again

Tom Yum Prawn- Delicious- hot and sour soup with ample shrimp- really flavorful would get again 10/10

Tom yum noodle soup- a little on the sour side- I recommend getting the tom yum prawn instead- better flavor

Honestly I would try anything on this menu at least once- that's how much confidence I have in this place!!!!!
Their new location is bigger, nicer, cleaner- parking lot! I took a lyft here- it's 6 minutes off the strip! 

One of the BEST restaurants in vegas!"}
{"text":"I came back again and got the crispy duck- OMG SO GOOD!!!!!! The duck is cooked perfectly - MUST GET THIS DISH. I think it's the best one.


In Summary
- Note the store hours, they are closed in between lunch and dinner
-Cab ride from airport is about 44 and it is also impossible to get a cab back- have to call
-Order CRISPY DUCK, CHICKEN PAD THAI, CURRY ROAST DUCK  
Bonus: garlic prawns are pretty good too
- Warning: You will have dreams about this place and coming back....I miss it :("}
{"text":"Definitely a must try... Great place, came here for my birthday & glad I did. Food was great, you can chose the level of spiciness on each dish. I heard wait is long so I made reservations & it worked out great. Cleanliness was great, service was great our waiter was awesome. We had a picky eater in our party and they were helpful getting her a dish she would like. Food portions are fair, over I really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Two words: Garlic Prawns! I would recommend this dish to anyone who loves some crispy well made shrimp! Came here and ordered the Tom Yum soup, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, Garlic Prawns and Drunken noodles with Soft Shell Crab. The soup was very eh in my opinion, I would skip it the next time I came here. I thought the Duck was well made and crispy even being drenched in sauce! The Drunken noodles were OK, not anything superb but definitely good. The best thing has to be hands down the Garlic Prawns, large pieces of shrimp that were crispy days after when the hubby ate it cold from the fridge!"}
{"text":"Holy hotness!  This place is absolutely delicious.  I am use to telling Thai places to give me the max hot level they have, but level 8 kicked my ass here. Loved it!  I'll be back next time I'm in town, their menu is long and there's lots to try!  Service was great too."}
{"text":"Why is this place so overrated and overpriced?? I was so excited to eat here and was super disappointed. It's REALLY not that great...it's good Thai food but it's far from the BEST Thai in the US and all that nonsense. The crispy duck was good but everything else was just...average with the price tag of amazing."}
{"text":"Chrissy Teigen eats here. Nuf said. GO GET THAI. 

K, but in all seriousness get your butt off the strip and into this hidden gem, smack in the middle of an unassuming strip mall.

Even our uber driver raved about this place on the car ride over. Her fav dish? A traditional choice of shrimp pad thai.

You wouldn't know it from the facade outside, but this place gleams. It's an understated glossy that made me feel sophisticated but not pretencious. Some blue lattice fencing strategically placed throughout the restaurant gave an air of privacy for the various sections of tables.

The servers are dressed sharp and they move quickly. They also love to make food recommendations. 

There is a whole room of wine shelves enclosed in a corner with glass walls. Patrons can see the room from their tables, so indulge in the vast wine list.

Two complaints:

I wish the curry was a little thicker in consistency. The taste was there. Spicy and sweet all at once, but it was a little thin for my liking. 

I also wish the serving of rice had been bigger. I had a lot of curry left in my bowl after finishing the chicken and veggies. I wanted to eat it with rice, but I didn't want to pay $3.25 for another bowl.

Bottom line:

My meal was $12, delicious, and classy. That's a big WIN in my book."}
{"text":"Poor location and not open for lunch. Server got our order wrong and became rude when we corrected her. Food is over rated from other reviews. Maybe it has gone down hill since previous ratings."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about but I went with a group of friends and ordered chicken curry duck curry some sour soup crab fried rice. Everything was good, yes but the food is not better than Krung Siam off Spring Mountain. Lotus Siam was way too crowded and loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is often my first stop when I arrive in Vegas. Their drunken noodles with prawns is something I dreams about at home.  Spicy beef salad is a wonderful compliment. Expect a minimum 45 min wait. They'll text you when your table is ready so grab a foot massage next door, (I do- it's wonderful)."}
{"text":"Delicious food. There's usually a wait 20 to 45 minutes, but it's wort it! Every time I visit Las Vegas I always make a point to come here!"}
{"text":"Do you watch parts unknown? Do you like Anthony Bourdain? Yeah, that's pretty much me. And this place was recently featured, I thought I'd go  check it out for myself. 

Ordered some of my fav dishes...
pad kee mao aka drunk noodles
Pad Ka Prow aka mint/basil leaf chicken
Crying tiger
Crispy duck paneng (favorite, eat it while its hot)
And the Sai Oua sausage

Split among 3 people, we killed it.

Portions here is not the best for the price. But each dish was tasty. Not to sound snobby or anything, but us angelinos are really spoiled by the diversity of our city. The flavors here is not something I haven't had before for a lot cheaper. I mean, I guess in Vegas, if you must have authentic Thai, this place will suffice. But if you are just like me, an Angelino visiting vegas, no need to make the special homage to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So glad I trusted the 4 stars on 1600 reviews and experienced Lotus of Siam. After eating overpriced crap food everywhere on the strip, my palate and entire body was screaming with joy here.

First off, what an interesting interior. The massive wine cellar and list is impressive. It still gave me a hole in the wall feel but it was a very large hole in the wall, unusually. The chandeliers were pretty to look at but it was hard to avoid the emergency exit sign/door that was next to my face from where we were seated. It didn't matter though, I was aching for some tummy comfort.

Papaya salad, Musamun Curry and Salt & Pepper Prawns. Holy eff. It did more than the trick and I literally cried when the bear wouldn't let me eat the leftovers after we got back to the fridge-less hotel & they had been sitting out for a couple hours, I was aching for more of that deliciousness...

I really wish I had gotten more chances to eat here and try some of their other specialties. Some of the best Thai I've had, ever."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and is very consistent in quality. This recent visit we ordered:

Fried Wontons - Ok....only was ordered to get the people that don't really fuck with thai food to get comfortable...

Tom Yum Kai - Fire! Getting a 4 on the spice level should be comfortable enough for everyone. A 4 translates to maybe a 5 or 6 for solid foods...A lemony, savory broth with heat. Chicken & Shrimp a plus too....

Roasted Duck Curry - Don't really fuck with duck but was a solid dish

Chicken Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) - Ever since I had drunken noodles I don't really fuck with pad thai anymore...

Pineapple Fried Rice - Hint of curry for savoriness and pineapple for hint of sweetness bringing this umami flavor to the dish.

Garlic Prawns - Must get item everytime. Shell and meat are seperated with it both being deep fried. The shell is edible and similar to shrimp chips as far as taste....

Each dish was done extremely well and with a huge menu where you can't go wrong with anything this place warrants a debatable title of best thai restaurant in Las Vegas if not the U.S."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews cautioning against dreadful crowds and long waits, we had no trouble getting seated immediately at 7 pm on a Friday night. This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I've ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). 

Despite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter's recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of \"lean\" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don't need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter's word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should've gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. 

Even though I wasn't impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking/her food in general. I'm not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I'd be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty / creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I'd just recommend staying away from the pork."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've ever had.  Food and service was exceptional.  Upscale atmosphere with reasonable prices on food and wine.

{"text":"Incredible everything and the wines by the glass rieslings is maybe the best in the country. Recommend the nam prik noom and anything from the last few pages of the menu! One of the gems of thai food in America"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet then you're not living life yet! LOL - but seriously though, this place has THE BEST Thai food. I'm not talking about a shop that sells sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, adds pad thai on the menu, and calls them self a Thai Restaurant. These are family recipes that are refined over years and years with perfection in mind and you can taste that love with every bite! I'm not even going to make recommendations on what to do order because we've been here a dozen times now and NOTHING, NOT EVEN ONE SINGLE dish has EVER been even minutely disappointing. If flavor perfection is a real thing, then this Is where it's at people. You get the sweet, salty, sour, spicy, and flavors I never knew even excised with each bite. Make reservations though because you'll be waiting for a hot minute without one. Don't sleep on this one next time you're in Vegas or I'll be telling you \"I told you so\"! Thank me later foodie fams!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Finally found the real Thai food with the right spice level. We enjoyed our papaya salad . This is a northern Thai restaurant so lots of throngs on the menu look different we got red curry and drunken noodles with duck. Both meals were done well however the duck was clearly the winner. Just the right amount of crispy and flavored were amazing . Thai ice tea is a must as well. I took away one star as I did not like the coconut icecream - felt I have had better preparations in NYC . Overall great food - would certainly return."}
{"text":"Yes, it is as good as its many awards, honors, and praises suggest. Order from the \"Northern\" part of the menu, which is towards the back pages of it.

I went with a group of 8 and nobody was disappointed. I had the Khao Soi which was so hearty and flavorful. With spicy level 6, it just had a nice kick without being hot. Perhaps Northern Thai is a little more relaxed than other places I have been with they spicy level. Our table tried everything from En Tuan soup (beef tendon with a deep rich broth and a huge basil taste), to Kang Hung Lay (Pork \"stew\" curry). 

What the group liked the most was the lightness of the dishes. The focus on herbs, spices and not coconut cream really allowed us to fill up without feeling weighed down.

My only regret is not getting the Nam Prik Ong, but that will happen next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to visit my parents in Vegas and we wanted to try something new.  We ordered take out because we did not want to wait for over 30 minutes for a table. Beware, the food portions are small so order a few more dishes. I was surprised when I saw the portion size. Overall, food was good."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of tagging along to the West Coast Yelp Spring Break trip with my Elite bestie!!  A group of her OC pals met up here for lunch and it was good!  

I ordered the yellow curry (mild) and my friend got the garlic chicken wings and some chicken dumplings. All the dishes were great, especially those chicken wings!!  Those suckers beat out KFC any day!

They also feature a buffet, but it was over-priced for such slim pickings, if you ask me. That said, this place is worth a try if you have a yen for Thai food."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed at all with this place. It didn't seem very authentic to me, nor was the food as good as people say. This is not the kind of Thai food I grew up eating, and my family is from Thailand and Laos. 

We got 6 dishes which we were to share amongst each other. Specifically: Chicken Kao Soi, the Crispy Duck in Chili Mint Leaves, Beef Pad See-ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, Papaya Salad, and Pork Larb. 

We started out with the Papaya Salad and Larb. Holy crap, were the portions tiny. I make papaya salad and also cucumber salad (same concept but with cucumber) every week, at home, in huge portions and it's a very inexpensive dish to make. There's no reason why it was served in such a small portion and at that price. It does come with sticky rice, but still, more would've been nice. Especially between 6 people. The Larb was tiny too. Each of us had a tbsp full on our plates. lol. It was cute, but also quite sad. Both dishes were gross to me, personally. Since when do you put sesame oil in either of those dishes? It must be a regional thing. I don't know. Either way, it was gross. I don't make it that way, nor do any of my family or friends whom are from Thailand and Laos. The Papaya salad had very unbalanced flavors too, which is Papaya salad blasphemy. It tasted sweet and spicy, but no salt or tartness. Weird. The Larb would have been ok if it wasn't drenched in sesame oil. I liked the spices, which were different, but good. 

The Entrees were also very tiny and mediocre. For a place with so much hype, I expected to be amazed. I wasn't. At least with most of the entrees. I didn't actually get to eat the duck or chicken wings, but I heard they were fantastic. My brother is a piggy, so he ate most of it. I pretty much sacrificed my food so everyone else could eat. Needless to say, I went to bed hungry that night. :(

As for the service, it was ok. Waiter didn't yell or throw stuff at us, so that was good. :P"}
{"text":"1st time there.  It is a little challenging to find, but turn into the plaza and keep turning to your right.

I was there with a large group, so I did not get to choose what I had.  The Garlic fried shrimp were incredible as were the beef and chicken potstickers.  The pad thai was very good as well.

Will have to go back with to see how it is for just a few people"}
{"text":"Been here many times, it is an absolute mist every time I go to vegas, the food is always delicious but i felt that this time the portions were smaller, my drunken noodle soft shell crab was great but little  amount of noodles compared to other times, had the prawns , papaya salad and also felt less were served. Anyway it was still all very good, will come back of course. Ordered some sake and beers to accompany the meal"}
{"text":"We usually watch Anthony Bourdain shows for food ideas when we are traveling to exotic international destinations. We don't consider Vegas in that set but we were glad we saw the recent Season 3 show just before a quick weekend trip there.  When our hotel, the Las Vegas Renaissance, also recommended Lotus of Siam, we knew we had to make a visit. 

We took a taxi about 2 miles from the hotel (which is near the convention center) to reach the strip mall -yes, it looks a little unexciting from the outside on a Monday morning at 11:45 am. We met two other traveling friends there, and focused on the Northern Thai food (near the back of the menu) that is Lotus of Siam's specialty. 

Between the 4 of us, we enjoyed Sai Oua (northern Style Sausage), Northern Larb, and two orders of the  Khao Soi, described as a typical Burmese influenced dish is served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, with your choice of meat. (We tried both the pork and the chicken versions.)

All were excellent, and very spicy, although you can request spice levels from 1 to 10. See photos here: http://www.travelingwiththejones.com/2014/05/10/anthony-bourdain-knows-good-food-northern-thai-in-las-vegas/

Take the short taxi ride. Order from the Northern Thai specialties. Enjoy! Perhaps Las Vegas is an exotic international destination after all."}
{"text":"THE MOST OVERRATED RESTAURANT EVER

Americanized southern fake thai food mostly; overpriced tourist trap. To all who read this: Jitlada in Los Angeles is an actual thai food restaurant. This place is highway robbery with hour+ wait times for the same basic pad Thai bullshit you can get anywhere in the U.S. Wow yelpers, get a friggin clue."}
{"text":"I used to love this place before it got so big. the food doesn't seem nearly as good. And the waitstaff is terrible. I prefer Weera or Le Thai."}
{"text":"It was okay. I was expecting some truly amazing food or theme.  In reality, it was just average. I base it on the fact that I have some pretty good Thai food where I live, priced the same as here and pretty comparable environment that in comparison, I'd have to say this is nothing special to go out of your way for.  

I would recommend this place only if you want some decent Thai food off the strip, in a local popular restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST THAI!!! When the taxi driver first dropped me off in front of Lotus of Siam, I wasn't immediately impressed. The strip mall this restaurant sits in is a little run down and the restaurant itself looks pretty bland and unexciting. This, however, was going to all change once I sat down and ordered the food. I am going to start off by saying that I have had TONS of Thai places, tried TONS of different variants of the same staple dishes. This place completely blew my mind. We ordered the crab fired rice, beef panang, garlic shrimp, and the nam kao tod. My favorite dish was the beef panang which was absolutley amazing. The slices of beef were huge and tender all the way through. The curry sauce was nice and thick and chock full of flavor. I litterally could have sat there all day with that sauce and just ate it with rice. 

You know a place like Lotus of Siam is good when you've got chefs like Guy Savoy coming here to eat. If you're ever in Vegas, make sure you hit this joint up and try to get there before they actually open for lunch because there's going to be a line outside for sure."}
{"text":"We've been promising ourselves to come here and we finally did. I was surprised how big it was inside. It was Sunday and we got right in, you will need to typically call for a reservation. The service was excellent and provided by \"Win\". We had the Red Snapper for two and it could have fed more. I can see why this restaurant has been rated in the top 5 in the country. The fish was prepared perfectly with a spicy and tangy sauce...off the charts! We also had the giant garlic prawns which were so good that we practically fought over the last shrimp. The price of our dinner was a bit hefty, but it was sooooooo delicious! If you like Thai this is a great place."}
{"text":"My partner had to make reservation to eat at this joint and it took him three attempts. It looks like a regular restaurant from the outside but it opens up as you go into the restaurant which was a little more pleasant. 

It's very crowded and the servers continuously bump our chairs when they have plenty of space to walk around us. Overrated and this food can be purchase at any Thai restaurant. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"The food here is a religious experience! Lived up to and exceeded all the hype you'll find on the net...

My co-worker and I split everything: Tom Kah Kai (Bangkok style, #23), NAM KAO TOD (interesting sour sausage and crispy rice app), Sea Bass (Drunken Noodle), and Crispy Duck (Penang).  Tony was our server and I will ask for him again by name next time I'm in Vegas. It's that good.

We did a toast to each course because we could not stop talking about the food!  At first I wondered why the Riesling section of the wine list was like 3 times as big as all the other sections, and then halfway through dinner, and one bottle down, it dawned on me: because it pairs better with the intense spice of Thai food better than any other wine!

Don't be sketched out about the strip mall location of the establishment.  It's part of the experience of finding it, and you will not soon forget your meal!  There's a reason why there are celebrity chef testimonials all over the walls..."}
{"text":"Wonderful wine list (lots of german whites, a perfect foil for spicy Thai cuisine), great service, pleasant atmosphere. Northern specialties available, as well as Ameri-Thai standbys. Not the best Thai restaurant in North America, but very good and a nice antidote to the overpriced, overwrought casino restaurants."}
{"text":"I showed up from Sacramento, California with high anticipation from reviews, reputation and recommendation.  Twenty dollar cab ride from the strip as we approach I'm thinking... uh are you sure this is it?  I'm reassured as I wait in a 70's strip mall for the door to open as other cabs and streams of people begin to show before the doors open on a Monday evening.

The chicken wings had to have one of the best flavors I've ever tasted on wings in my life.  I could sit there and eat enough of those alone to get sick to my stomach.  Service was on par as this place steadily filled up.  Dishes came out fast to our table and the owner came out and snapped a photo upon request from our table.  Hey I'm no Joe Montana but I took a picture just like he did.  They are so humble towards people from all over the world who come to eat their food.

Our table had some common dishes Americans are use to and everything met or exceeded expectations.  If you ever, ever are in Vegas and want Thai food this is the place.  They also have won consecutive national awards for their wine list.  I will remember this as champagne taste on a beer budget.  Absolute awesomeness!"}
{"text":"You know what they say about location, location, location?  Well this place is in a horrible location to say the very least.   I was extremely nervous to leave my car in the parking lot & while walking to the restaurant a bum rode up on his bicycle and asked us for money. Sketchy!  But we kept on because of the glowing reviews.

Also, there's a swingers club in the same strip mall....gives new meaning to strip mall. the inside decor of the restaurant leaves much to be desired as well. This is not a 'date place' in terms of dressing up.  Jeans are protocol here.

They also don't take reservations, which doesn't score any points with me.  Our waitress barely spoke English to the point where another one of the waiters had to assist with our table.  She also asked us if we liked cats????????????? Now when eating in an Asian restaurant we both thought this was extremely weird. Apparently, she had found a mother cat with babies and was trying to find them homes?????? At least that's what we hope.

Food was pretty good, I wouldn't' say it's the best Thai food I've ever had, Sakun Thai is closer to me and just as good.

I'm going to go back and try it again in case there's something I missed. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Just an unbelievable Panang Curry with Crispy Duck... Can't say enough about how great this place is. Ditch the strip; head here."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. All hype. Definitely not worth a 2 hour wait. 
What we ordered;
Garlic wings - good
Garlic prawns - very good
Tum yum Kai (hot sour soup) - good
Garlic squid - average
Drunken noodles duck - not so great. The noodles was hard and stuck together as though it wasn't cooked properly and wasn't seasoned well. The duck used was very fatty.

I may be spoiled living in California and having access to great food all the time. Perhaps that's why I wasn't impressed. Overall this spot serves average Thai food. I would not go back again especially for a 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The flavorful combinations of spices are like nothing I have ever experienced.  Every dish is so unique and flavorful!!   All the other reviews say enough I just had to add my 5 stars.  This place is amazing and I will not ever leave Vegas without eating here.  The staff is amazing,  it is quite intimate for being such a busy place, and the food is exquisite!! 

You must try this place!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Wait wasn't too long. Looks like they try to turn tables over pretty quickly without rushing people. Had the som tom and haven't had any that good since I was in Thailand!! It was great and actually spicy:) definitely will come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant wasn't located in the glitzy part of town. But, don't be fooled by the humble facade. I'd recommend calling beforehand and making reservations as the waiting time was a bit long -- 40 minutes for 3 people -- even on a Monday night.

The inside of the restaurant isn't glitzy either. Except for the glass storage room where they store their wines, the inside definitely needs some modernizing. But, it's clean and roomy.

My friends ordered the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai, while I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. The food were served simply: no fancy garnishes or pretentiousness. It was like being served a home-cooked meal. My food was flavorful and tangy. I loved the abundance of vegetables, and the fresh cucumbers were an interesting contrast to the sweet pineapple chunks. My friends devoured their food, and vowed to come more often, especially since they actually live in Vegas.

The service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. He refilled our rice bowls and drinks when needed. He even boxed up my leftovers for me, and gave me some extra rice to go with it. Overall, I really liked this restaurant, and I understand why it was rated so highly. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I'll definitely be eating here."}
{"text":"Funny story, Lotus of Siam when you drive by from Sahara looks like a hole in the wall broken down place that you would never want to eat at. On 2 different occassions I planned on going there and both times when I drove by we decided to go somewhere else. About a year ago we bit the bullet and decided to try it. Surprisingly enough the front of the restaraunt is in the back and we were basically looking at the back of the place when driving by. It can be deceiving. I've been there 1/2 dozen times since. Last night we went and there was a 1 hour - 1.5 hour wait to get seated. The foods so good we waited over an hour.

I've read reviews from more than one food critic calling is the best Thai Food in all of North America. I've been to Thailand for a month to train and the food is actually better at Lotus of Siam! The owner apparently started cooking in Thailand at age 5 with her mother/grandmother and brough that experience to Vegas. Just yesterday I saw on Yahoo that Lotus of Siam was #89 on the list of the best 101 restaraunts in the USA.

As for the food, some things I recommened for an appetizer are the Prawns in a blanket, spicy chilli chicken wings and also the Tom Kah Kai Soup. For dessert the Mango Sticky Rice is the bomb. 

I went with 3 people total and for our main courses to split we got Crispy garlic prawns, Panang Curry and Sea bass over drunken noodles. I've had numerous dishes here and they are all good. All the curries are great, the pad thai, the crispy duck. Great flavors and taste you wont find many other places. I see myself going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Another one of those moments when I wish Yelp had a half-star option. Okay, so here's the scoop...

I'm a Thai fanatic. Sometimes I'll eat it 25 times in a month. I know where all the good places are, I try most Thai restaurants in most cities I live in. So when I heard that this place was supposed to be \"the best Thai food in America,\" I put a lot of effort into checking it out. Walked 45 minutes or so, actually (with all of the awful Vegas crosswalks).

The place is in a dumpy strip mall past a gay sex club and an Indian restaurant. Boo-yah. Servers weren't particularly friendly, and while the place was huge, it wasn't particularly... aesthetically pleasing. A bit old-school.

We ordered from a rather stoic waitress, and our food arrived quickly. It was really good. Delicious, even. But at the end of the day, it didn't unseat MY nomination for the best Thai food in America... Spicy BBQ Restaurant in Hollywood, CA. And there, the server (Kay) is an absolute sweetheart.

Four stars, for REALLY good food in a meh setting with meh service."}
{"text":"When travelling, always consult YELP!, or google a list of Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives places,  or the Best I've ever Eaten lists.

Having been in Vegas several times now, I try to visit at least one new place on these lists each time I'm there.  

I was so super excited about the Lotus of Siam!  YELPers have given them a 4-STAR, it made it on Chef Ming's Best I've Ever Had list, so I thought we would LOVVVE it.  Alas, we did not love it. :(

It is partially my fault.  Going against everything sacred about my fooding skills, we opted for the lunch buffet instead of ordering off the menu.  It wasn't a matter of cost, more a matter of variety.  I thought this would be the best way for us to try a plethora of dishes and see what the restaurant had to offer!  FAIL.

There were a couple of items that were very good, the tom  yum soup was spicy, fragrant and steaming with deliciousness.  Everything else available was slightly subpar, from the dried out, overcooked chicken wings (not spicy at all by the way) to the pad thai that simply tasted like stir fried rice noodles.  I was disappointed.  There was a really yummy egg omelet with tomatoes and onions that i could've eaten alone with just steamed rice-but that shouldnt be the highlight for a place like this.

Like I said, it was probably my fault for not ordering dishes that had been recommended by others.  We may try it again, who am I kidding, there are like 47,000 other restaurants in Vegas, baby!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Garlic fried shrimp! Make sure you consider sharing the generous portions."}
{"text":"Heard about Lotus of Siam on Top Chef Masters.  Every bite I had was incredible!  We tried variety of items: Stuffed Chicken Leg, Bacon Shrimp, Pad Thai, Braised Short Rib in Red Panage, Crab Fried Rice, Fried Bananas.  My favorite was the Crab Fried Rice, it is a must have!!! Get there early,to avoid a Lon wait or make reservations a day or two ahead.  It is a definite must visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived In vegas for over 8 years and just got around to trying this place. By far the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. The food is so flavorful and stimulating to the palate. We ordered many different things and all were great. I'm sure there is something on the menu for everyone. Next time I will be trying the whole fried catfish with garlic and red chilies. The people next to us ordered it and it looked so yummy with a beautiful presentation. Now this place is in the ghetto ghost town part of vegas, the place looks worn down and outdated inside and out BUT who cares as long as the food is as tasty as it is. I also happened to love the owner of this restaurant. An older women who is involved in every aspect of her restaurant. I loved the way she would step out of the kitchen to check to see if everyone was enjoying the food and atmosphere. I even saw her washing drinking glasses, now that is one humble lady. I'm also assuming she has not opened another location due to the fact that she can't be at two places at the same time! Asian business lady, I salute you! You have accomplished so much to where it's said to be rated the best Thai restaurant in the USA."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this!

Whenever I am in Las Vegas I make it a point to come to this place for the Garlic Prawns... This is a must order item.  It also never fails that every time I am eating my dinner random diners come up and ask me \"What is that - that looks good.\"  It happened last night and it has happened every time. 

For appetizer I love the crispy rice with ham and chili lime sauce... I don't remember the name of the appetizer but it is the last one listed on the menu... also a favorite and sometimes I order two of them because they are so good."}
{"text":"My long awaited return to Lotus.

As most people know, the TV food shows love to rave about this place, in some cases with good reason, as we have our own favorite Thai restaurant (check my reviews, it isn't hard to figure out) and we would be eating there the following night, it gave me a good chance to compare dishes.

So direct comparison...

Chicken Sa-tay: Both restaurants do a good Sa-Tay, the taste of the chicken itself goes to Lotus, but it is close, however the other place has a far better peanut sauce.

Chicken Wings....Lotus all the way, man I could eat a bucket full of those babies.

Chicken Pad Thai...The other restaurant is far better, the taste element just isn't there with Lotus and there is a definite texture issue.

Chicken curry...Both places are good, I would say the other is slightly better.

Now to be fair, on previous trips to Lotus I have had to amazing dishes, they were specials of the day, but I think it is fair to mention at least one, the sea bass was amazing, I really wish they would put this one the menu, perfectly cooked, great texture and flavors.

On this last trip though, what really let it down was the service, we were the second group to be seated, the second group to order, our drinks we delivered quickly, the same with the appetizers..... Then nothing...for over an hour, fortunately our little group only gets to meet a couple of times a year, so we had plenty to talk about, but still, watching tables have their food delivered after they had been seated way after us is slightly annoying to say the least. The service itself was well remote to say the least, yes I know this place is busy no matter what, yes I know they will stay busy with the TV shows promoting them, but I really don't care, if the service stays like this then Lotus goes on my no dine list...

If not for the service Lotus would have gotten a 4 star rating from me, as ever food is an extremely personal thing, what one person may love another will hate, I have no issues recomennding Lotus, but there are better out there."}
{"text":"Best Duck Panang I've ever had. World class Thai food. Service often is extremely slow, but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Lotus of Siam since 2006 and the food is awesome, but they have become a victim of their own success. They expanded their seating capacity but not their kitchen and it shows. I'm writing this after waiting over 40 minutes for my food and watching people walk out the door, giving up after waiting too long for their food...very sad. I also noticed the food portions are smaller than before. Breaks my heart as this one of my favorites in Las Vegas. If you decide to eat here, ask for Tony, he is the best."}
{"text":"Another spot we visited on our trip to Vegas. Coming from San Diego and living by quite a few Chinese/Asian restaurants and having a Chinese girlfriend I expect certain things at a restaurant like this. There stuffed chicken wings were freaking amazing. I would go back for those but only those. There sticky rice was hard and dry, there garlic wings were the same. The garlic wings looked as if they had made a huge batch hours before we ordered them and they had them under a heat lamp waiting to be ordered. They tasted the way they look, dry and old. There spicy fried rice was ok, but for $13 dollars anywhere back in San Diego I would have gotten three times the amount. Definitely not worth what you pay for it. The service was also weird. Both the guy serving our food and the other guy who was walking around, looking like a manager of some sort. They just had very odd personalities and seemed a bit unsure about every thing lol."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite, and this place does not disappoint.  Everything we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"I really don't like Thai food and probably the last thing I'd pick to eat, but this place changed my whole eating career. Absolutely amazing Thai food I ever had. (Of course best in the States, I've been to Thailand and you can't really beat the motherland) 

 Garlic prawn, sea bass drunken noodles, tom yum koon, green chicken curry. You really can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu. 

This place gets crowded so must come early like 1-2 hours to get a table around dinner time. Well worth the wait. Enjoy! Sawadee ka/kap.. :-)"}
{"text":"Lotus never fails !!! Food is amazing !!! Try the beef satay & beef panang curry ... you'll not be disappointed!!! Love coming here - favorite restaurant in town"}
{"text":"My bar is high when it comes to Asian food and Lotus of Siam really delivered.  This place is just as good as any restaurant I've been to in Bangkok and I only wished I lived close enough to visit Lotus of Siam on a regular basis.

Don't be turned off by the shady strip mall location.  Uber/Cabs will be pulling up one after the other and once you open the door, you'll see how packed and large the restaurant is.

Hands down my favorite was the Crispy Duck with Penang Curry. This was sooo good, we ordered 2 plates.  Before doing so, I asked the waiter if there was anything comparable and he said the duck curry is in an entirely different league and he was right. I only wished they provide double the amount of curry so that I can soak my rice in it and lick the plate twice!  I'll definitely be dreaming about this dish for years to come as its probably one of my favorite plates of all time. It deserves every single accolade.

With that in mind, I also tried the popular Garlic Shrimp and was sorely disappointed.  This tasted similar to seafood dishes at cantonese restaurants and was a tad too greasy.

However I LOVED the crispy rice with sausage. Every individual rice morsel was light and crispy. I just don't know how they do it but I'll def be ordering again.

The Thum Ka Noon was a total surprise. I didn't expect the dish to taste the way it did but it was delicious and the tastiness grows with every bite.  

We ended the meal with Mango Sticky Rice and Coconut Ice Cream.  Perfectly ripe and transported me right back to Thailand

One additional note - we ordered a 5 in spiciness.  I don't like the burn your tongue spiciness but I certainly the spice level could have been kicked up a notch and will probably order a 7 or 8 next time around.  

Make a reservation and don't be late."}
{"text":"I was not thrilled. A friend wanted to go cause she was sick and wanted spicy soup to open up all her senses and I was so annoyed it was awful!  We were only guest in restaurant and another gentlemen came with a baby in a baby car seat and they sat him on us...like pretty much sat right on us...dude the whole place is full I mean seat guests around we even joked with the man how we felt we were having family dinner with him!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best part of our first night in Vegas. The food was great, the wine too, and the service was excellent. Our waiter (Joe?) had great recommendations, and we got to try some dishes from northern Thailand that we'd never had or seen before. The Papaya salad definitely had some kick (which I liked) and our waiter brought us some Thai iced tea without us asking when he noticed a little sweat. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"OK, I love LOS and have eaten there well over a hundred times in the almost 19 years they have been open in Las Vegas. The quality of the food hardly ever varied and it was a SOLID FIVE STAR RESTAURANT. 

However, my last two visits held a few disappointments; I consider Nam Kao Tod to be one of the world's truly great dishes and almost always order it at LOS. The last two times I ordered Nam Kao Tod it was not the incredible, compelling, best thing I ever ate dish that it always was before, it was just OK. Another favorite, the Garlic Prawns were not prepared as carefully as usual and the portion size was HALF of what we were served before, other dishes also seemed to be served in smaller portions. I hope the problems were kitchen anomalies that do not become permanent. 

The smaller portions are more troubling, no one deserved a James Beard award more than Saipin but I hope that isn't the reason for the smaller portions and much higher prices.. Overall, still an excellent meal, just not the 5 STAR, 28 point Zagat, worth a drive from anywhere quality that I am used to at LOS. I really really want to give this place 5 STARS again!

P.S., So sorry to hear about the water damage and closing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had.  I had the drunken noodles with seafood from the front of the menu for $14.  It was delish.  However, husband had the crispy duck panang curry that is from the back of the menu and it was mind blowing.  Orgasmic.  No joke.  I have had Thai curry from many many places and this made the other places taste like sad watered down imitations.  Holy cow.  It was simple.  Just duck and curry.  No veggies in the curry.  However, that in itself was a flavor explosion.  It's not cheap.  It's $28 but it's worth it.  The portion is not big but it's worth it.  It's simply a symphony of flavors that dance on your palate. Rich and creamy.   Texture of the duck is amazing.  The duck skin is lightly battered and the fat is rendered beautifully. 

We had an appetizer which was the Larb.  I thought it was good but not worth the price at $12.  You had to buy the sticky rice as an extra side at $2.50. Very very small serving.  Maybe two small hands worth.  Again, why are Asian restaurants charging for rice in Vegas??? You need the rice though b/c otherwise you are eating minced meat with...um....nothing.  There's nothing to eat it with b/c it's just a little bowl of minced meat.  

Service was very nice and the server gave us very good recommendations.  There was no wait for lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"Taxis frequently drop off tourists at this ghetto location....but there's definitely a reason for it!  Located in a sketchy strip mall is one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  Even when I am at other Thai establishments...I daydream about the food here.  

One stand out dish is the fried garlic prawns with shells (FYI shells can be eaten in this case..).  The sea bass options on the menu are all solid as well.  If you order the typical noodle/rice/curry dishes that are available at other Thai restaurants, you will not be impressed and you will feel you have over paid.  The Northern Thai menu is also delicious and adds a little variety compared to other Thai restaurants in the area....while the menu states the dishes are more mild...they still left my mouth on fire.

Lotus also has a buffet lunch option.. especially if you are on a time crunch.  Very basic dishes like pad thai, pad see ew, vegetable curry, and assortment of fried foods (tempura, chicken wings, egg rolls) are set out in the middle of the restaurant and constantly filled.  The stand out items in the buffet lunch are the fried chicken wings and the coconut/banana egg roll.  For the price you pay...definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I have found in my travels.  We ended up making a reservation 1 month before being in town due to the overwhelming popularity.  The wait can easily get up to 1hr if you do not make a reservation.  The wait staff is very friendly and helpful with a good dinning experience.

We ordered the Khao Soi Braised Short Rib and the Khao Soi Crispy Duck and they were outstanding.  Both dishes were $27 a piece but totally worth the extra money over the normal Khao Soi.  I would highly recommend either dish to everyone!  

The last thing I can say is that we went back within 24hrs to eat here again (had to wait an hour)!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food anywhere. Pad see ew is incredible. So is the fried rice. If you're unsure whether or not to believe all the hype you hear around this restaurant, you shouldn't. It's even BETTER than what you here :) but be prepared to wait awhile and don't bother calling, their phone will be off the hook."}
{"text":"Boom!  This place is the bomb, eat everything here it's so good.  The Thai coffee was excellent I would recommend eating here for sure"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Thai place I'be tried in the area.
No wonder there's always a line of people wanting to try it and dine here again and again.
This will be my go to Thai place when in the area.

Atmosphere is pretty casual with a good mix of people.
Once we got our name down, they let us in to avoid the hot weather outside.
We waited for our table and sat in the lounge bar area and grabbed some drinks first.
Total wait time about 15 minutes.
We were in line before they opened at 5:30pm.
Well worth the wait.
Highly recommend the spicy papaya salad with no fish sauce, Sea bass, chicken wings( medium spice) and the veggie egg rolls."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several good Thai restaurants throughout the U.S. but have never been to Thailand. So, when my Bangkok-born mother-in-law told me that Lotus of Siam is right on par with restaurants in Thailand, I had to go and see how it compared to the other Thai places I had experienced. 

This place is a bit on the pricey side but it does not disappoint. Although it is located in the 'hood, the interior of the restaurant is quite nice and spacious. I was also surprised to find that many celebrity chefs have dined at Lotus of Siam. In sum, the food is amazing and service is directly on-point. The restaurant is consistently packed so you should make reservations in advance - that is, unless you know the owners like my MIL.

We ordered the Tom Yum Kung (spicy lemongrass soup with shrimp etc.), Larb (ground pork salad), sticky rice, vegetarian fried rice, Nua Dad Deaw (beef jerky) and garlic prawns. Order the garlic prawns and eat the shell!!! This dish is so good that it will make you want to run to the ocean, hop on a boat, catch prawns to extinction, and bring them to Lotus of Siam to cook up! Other than the prawns, the rest of the dishes were comparable to those served at other good Thai establishments.

Dinner for 4 cost about $100. Not bad for a four-and-a-half-stars meal."}
{"text":"Garlic prawns and crispy duck curry are the best. I could eat this everyday. 

The place was so packed when we went for dinner Friday night. Our reservation was for 7:30 and yea, full house.  Great service and tasty food."}
{"text":"Not for the faint of heart. YES, everything you read about this location is true and when you go at night for dinner, it's especially scary but oh so worth the risk! 

Once you step inside, it's as if you walked through the looking glass. The restaurant is huge, with a very large wine room that you can see through the glass walls. We didn't make reservations and our expected wait was 45 minutes for three but were seated in a short 15 minutes, just enough time to order drinks at the bar. Note that they only serve beer, wine (huge selection) and sake.

Service was efficient and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions. I was determined not to order regular dishes but was with some diners that aren't that adventurous, so no raw meat, liver or too spicy!

We ordered Tod Mun Plar, Garlic/Pepper Chicken Wings and Pad Thai. All were very good, fresh and more than enough to share for 4 but only three of us. Also, luckily we ordered  these typical dishes because it was all the non spicy eater in our group could eat, although the fish cakes had a little kick.

We ordered the Squid garlic, sauce was amazing, even just with rice! The waiter suggested the Braised Short Rib with Panang and Thai Basil Catfish. Here is where we tread the spicy fantastic. We specifically ordered mild and their mild is a regular joe's spicy! It was great and depth of flavors, even with the heat, were so good. Thankfully, the water server did her rounds regularly and filled our glasses each time!

The fifth star really is for the price. Six dishes and drinks for three (enough food for four) was under $100, unheard of for such great food, environment and service."}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas, so when I saw there website I was super surprised walking in. It was much more down to earth, (props to whoever prepared there site). We didn't make reservations but took about 40 mins to sit down, which was understandable, they were busy and not a huge restaurant. I ordered jackfruit and curry which had a nice spice to it. It was my first time having jackfruit, it was different, but good, not an explosive flavor. The curry was extremely good. I'm not surprised that this restaurant is such a hit with the locals."}
{"text":"Seriously? How have I never written a review for Lotus?

This is, without question, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world. If I'm ever on death row, this is my last meal. If I ever moved away from Vegas, Lotus is probably what i would miss the most. I have been eating there about twice a month for the five years I've been living in Vegas. On her third or fourth nomination, chef Saipin Chutima won the James Beard Award this year - but the secret has long been out about this amazing, otherworldly culinary experience 3/4 of a mile and worlds away from the Strip.

Almost everything I have ever eaten here is absolutely fantastic, and for spice junkies like myself it's a legitimate challenge. They operate on a 1-10 scale, but there's actually a spice level 15. I don't recommend it. But if you like some serious heat to your food, a 10 will kick your ass. The 15 is just unnecessary.

As for the dishes, almost all that I've ever had are fantastic. Here are my recommendations from the gargantuan, 150+ item menu:

11. Garlic Pepper Chicken Wings. These are bursting with flavor from the fried garlic and the green onions that practically drip off the crispy wings. I'm not really much of a wing person but I can go to town on these.

13. Nua Dad Deaw. This Issan style beef jerky is, in flavor and texture, completely different than any jerky you've ever had.

14. Nam Kao Tod. The BEST DISH EVER, and I mean ever. I order this every single time I go. It's a sour sausage salad over crispy rice with a complex and vibrant flavor profile that includes the always distinct and recognizable tastes of green and red onions, peanuts, ginger, mint, cilantro, lime, basil and chili. Seriously, I've never seen this offered anywhere else and it's unlike any other food on earth. You've never seen so many flavors, colors and textures all in the same dish.

55. Nua Nam Tok. Charbroiled beef on a flavorful and tangy mix of lime, rice powder and green onion.

59. Koi Soy. This Issan style steak tartare is unbelievably good. The rice powder makes for an incredible texture contrast with the beef, and the lime and chili mix almost cooks the beef the way that the citric acid in a ceviche cooks the fish. This one gets really intense when you turn the spice level up on it.

66. Issan Sausage. Let me tell you a little story about their Issan sausage, cured for weeks in-house with a mixture of pork, wine, garlic and spices. They ran out of it for a period of a few weeks a few summers back, and they were the longest weeks of my life. I craved it like a crack baby. It's a dry, sour sausage that's paired with ginger, peanuts, fresh chilis and red onions. This is probably about my 2nd most common entree order. Be sure to get some rice to mix it with, and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf. That's how it's eaten when served off street carts in Thailand.

72. Mint and Green Chili. Heat of spice countered by cool mint. I daydream about this sometimes.

79. Pepper Garlic Sauce. Emphasis on the garlic. Lots of green onions on this one too, that combination seems to work well.

102. Pad Thai. I've never had a better version of this dish, which all too often tastes too much of tamarind. But this is a subtle blend of the dish's strong flavors. Never had better.

107. Kai Koowah. Like a more flavorful, less salty chow fun.

121. Spicy Fried Rice. I feel like a gringo because I order the spicy fried rice more than any other entree. But it is simply a flavorful delivery system for some of the most intensely flavorful but not overwhelming heat in the whole desert. (I always order this level 10 spicy. I don't F around.) The garlic, basil, and fresh chilis add a bolt of lightning to a savory bowl of fried rice. Again, the best of its kind.

H. Nam Prik Noom. This green chili dip is the perfect choice for when you just want something light.

Those are my go-tos on the Lotus menu, depending on my mood. There's a couple other things that need to be said about Lotus.

The wine list is mind-boggling and affordable. It's a special treat for lovers of German and Austrian Rieslings.

The lunch buffet should be skipped. If you get it, you're missing out on most of the things that make Lotus such a special dining destination. Although I would be lying if I said I had never had the lunch buffet and piled on plate after plate after plate of garlic chicken wings and the world's best pad thai. But I'm there twice a month or more, that's a luxury I have that most Lotus visitors don't.

If you only eat one meal in Vegas, make this it."}
{"text":"Can't talk.... mouth still on fire. In a good way. Eat here! Beware of any spice higher than a 7!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had. We ordered the yellow curry beef and the Chicken de Rama. Both were very good. The chicken de Rama had a lot of flavor and the yellow curry was like typical yellow curry we've had at other Thai places, and also very good. We chose a spice level or 3, which was perfect. 

The service was great, the inside of the restaurant was nice. Outside was a little sketchy.  I would knock half a star off for the portion size.  It was decent portions but the de Rama was on the small side."}
{"text":"The hype is so freaking real. This unassuming restaurant in a strip mall is a diamond in the rough. I was only a mild Thai food fan, until the day I came here.

My foodie best friend had already been here, but I had not. Our goal was to order their specialties (Northern Thai cuisine) and items that we probably can't get as easily at other basic Thai restaurants. We ordered four total dishes (most tables had 1 dish per person), and definitely had leftovers for drunchies later that weekend.

CRISPY DUCK IS LIFE. So we tried the crispy duck khao soi. This curry sauce sits on egg noodles. The curry is good, but the duck is the star. It is everything you want from duck. The meat is flavorful and tender, and the skin is just perfection-- crispy, crunchy, and just craveable. I'm drooling as a write this review.

We also tried the northern larb. This is different from the typical larb you find at other Thai restaurants. It was made with ground pork, and does not contain lime. It was so flavorful and herbacious.

I guess the most disappointing dish was the northern style tom kah kai. We honestly could have skipped this one. This was different because it didn't use coconut cream, so it was a clear broth. It was super acidic and tart-- it reminded me of sinigang!

The biggest surprise for us was the nam kao tod, which was an appetizer with crispy rice, pork sausages, herbs, and was actually sour and spicy. It was really good, and it gave me the salty and the sour, and the spice. 

There's so many dishes I want to go back and try too... i.e. drunken noodle soft shell crab. Yes, deep fried soft shell crab on top of spicy stir-fried flat rice noodles.

I can't wait to bring my fiance back to try this gem!"}
{"text":"I am no expert in Thai cuisine. However, I believe that good food is universally good. I have travelled the world and eaten cuisine from many different countries, and It is hard for me to even fathom how this place can have an avg of 2 hours wait for dinner. 

I ordered the following:

1. Garlic prawns: 0/5. I ordered based on the rave reviews. At $28, I expected more than prawn shells that were fried to oblivion. Half the shells didn't even have any meat inside. It was severely lacking in garlic flavor.

2. Tom yum Kai: 3/5 tasty but lukewarm. I expected it to be steaming hot, but it felt like the bowl had been sitting out for a while before it was served.

3. Crispy pork belly (#87): 0/5 can be a true delicacy if done right. Lotus, however, did not get it right. It was cold and the portion was abysmal for the price. I could have taken a slab of bacon and fried it with better flavor

4. Drunken noodles with seafood: 0/5 again, portion was small for the price. To add insult to injury, they used fake imitation crab!!! That's disgusting. 

Overall, not worth the wait or the $80 bill. I have heard that the famous lady chef who made this restaurant into fame has retired, and I believe it because based on my experience, it is no better than the average Thai restaurant in middle of nowhere Wyoming. DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Must try when you're in Vegas! 

Service is great and attentive, food is phenomenal! This restaurant is a little off the strip but is so well worth trying. It does get busy so try going for lunch because dinner is incredibly packed! However, it would be a great dinner if you could wait that long. 

Pad Thai isn't too sweet, pad see ew is perfectly seasoned, crispy duck panang is off the hooks! Although the soups are too sour for my liking, I can't dock any stars because the rest of the food IMMENSELY makes up for it. 

I noticed that there's a lot of photos on the wall autographed by celebrities so this place isn't just popular amongst regular sinners but also among the celebrity sinners! 

Go out of your way to try this place out! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This place was packed even before I showed up with 16 people, somehow we managed to get a spot quickly enough and were served right away with wine and food coming quickly. Lunch was amazing, the KRAPHAO MOO KROB and spicy fried beef rice has inspired me to try and recreate it in my own kitchen. The only dish that I didn't love was the MEE KROB. It for me was a little too sweet, but everyone else enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Crispy Duck is really good! The service was fast. The place outside looks like an abandoned place but really cool inside with a big open wine cellar! Must try!"}
{"text":"Is it the best thai restaurant in the US?   Hmm... it definitely is one of the most expensive BUT for that price, you can taste that it is a notch above all the other thai restaurants.   We had something like Mi krop with sour sausages (one of their top 3 most popular), sea bass on top of drunken noodles (also another top 3 most popular), minced jackfruit with pork (something different since you don't usually see that) and sticky rice with mango.   Now.... the thing is that I've had almost all these dishes at other thai restaurants.  Each one of the dishes were slightly better (more sour, more greens, better quality fish, better cooking technique, in season fruits, garnishes you can eat, no fillers)  than at my favorite places in Thaitown in Hollywood, CA.     The owner here.... tons of people waiting and the bums in the parking lot asking for money.   Would I recommend a visit....   definitely -- only a few places in the US that you can eat at a James Beard award winner that is reasonable in price."}
{"text":"My wife and I both love Thai food, so eating at Lotus on our Vegas trip was a must. The one bad part about this was that there were only two of us, meaning we couldn't order a lot (well, we could have, but then we'd have a buttload leftover). So we settled on a cup of the Tom Yum Koong, Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles, and the Fried Garlic Prawns.
 
Needless to say, we really enjoyed all three. The soup had just the right amount of tanginess and kick, and the cup was full of huge shrimp (oxymoron, I know).
 
My wife had never eaten soft shell crab before, so she was a little weirded out by it here, but I really liked it and we both loved the noodles; great texture and flavor there.
 
And I liked the prawns more and more as I ate them, but I have to say... I'm not sure how I feel about eating the shells like chips. There's definitely a certain taste to it, but I don't think I'm a fan of it just yet. I'll have to try it again.
 
We got there fifteen minutes prior to opening on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is spacious and clean, so try to get there as close to opening time as possible. Otherwise, I would recommend making reservations.
 
Having said all that, I'm not sure that I can back the statement of this being the best Thai restaurant in the country, but it is dang good. Take that however you'd like. And I will be back, but hopefully with more people so I can try more dishes. So many to choose from!"}
{"text":"Last night a group of us had dinner here and it was one of the biggest let-down dining experiences I have ever had. First of all it was over 
an hour wait to be seated. Then then after a long wait for our food it arrived cold. When we complained we were told that as a rule they serve their food at room temperature!
This was food that was pricey and the portions were small. The service was terrible as they did not even make an effort to accommodate our preferences. We came because it had good ratings and we wanted to try it out based on it's advertised \"exquisite cuisine\". At least the food tasted good even though we lost our appetite with the way it was served and the bad service! Never going back again!!"}
{"text":"I ate here on a Saturday night. They didn't have any open reservations due to the busy New Year weekend. The wait was about an hour. I like that they text you when your table is ready so you don't have to just wait there. You could probably grab a sangria at firefly down the street and come back in time for your table. 

The new location is a big upgrade from the old location. It's no longer in a ghetto strip mall. I really like the decor especially the wallpaper that the owner got from Thailand. 

Service was top notch!! We were checked on by numerous staff members and I really like that they change your plate without asking when your old one is dirty. The staff was amazing and I was very impressed by their customer service. 

Food was 10/10. We got the shrimp Tom yum medium and it was wayyyy too spicy for me and my bf.  They don't joke around with them Thai chili's!! We asked them if we could exchange it for a mild as our tongues and lips were burning and they did it without hesitation!! You have to get the  garlic prawns!!! They are delicious. We also ordered a Thai beef salad and a crispy duck khao soi which were also yummy!! 

Overall I had an amazing experience here and would highly recommend to everyone! Just be careful on the spice level that you order because mild is already really spicy."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place since seeing it in Travel Channel and Anthony Bourdain's show. I have to say the food was underwhelming.  I had the crispy duck, Thai salad, and a jackfruit curry dish.  Everything was kind of bland.  I have to much better Thai restaurants and a lot cheaper.  Goes to show trust Yelp and not travel channel."}
{"text":"I returned and I am still a fan! The line still goes out the door for this place.  I ordered the same meal I had 4 years ago: Tom Ka Khai soup and mussaman. Deeee-lish!  It's really interesting to try the soup at other Thai restaurants and then to try it here. The flavors are so well balanced (although it's still a bit salty!)  The mussaman was delicious as well, and I swear I tasted lemongrass in it.  

This place has quite a wine selection. My friend is a connoisseur and was impressed with their German selections in particular. 

We did not get reservations but showed up on a weekday around 6:30 and were seated about 10 minutes later. The restaurant was not at all full, but apparently there is a shortage of menus, causing the delay.  Service in general is VERY slow. People who showed up after we did were served before we were, however, for reasons unknown."}
{"text":"It was an ominous night. Rain drops pattering on the windshield of our car, hard enough that the glass could just shatter. Pouring. Thunder in the backdrop. Screaming. Our phones beeped, \"FLOOD ALERT!\"  Was this really a good day to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday? We didn't know what to expect when we pulled into this shady plaza off the strip, hoping to try the Lotus of Siam that everyone raved so much about. 

We were lucky, planning ahead and reserving our tables. As a word of advice, I suggest that you always ALWAYS reserve ahead of time before coming to this place. Even with such horrible weather, there were hordes of customers waiting outside in queue. 

Being seated into the restaurant, it was a bit overwhelming at first. It was crowded - so so crowded. There were pictures framed covering every inch of the walls, tables everywhere leaving little space for walking, kitchen staff and servers bustling and turning. The menu was extensive and we didn't know where to start and choose from. Our  server even forgot to give us our straws until perhaps 7 minutes into the dinner service. 

So then, why the 5 stars?

As we all know, it's the food. The food is what kept us happy and going, and saved this restaurant from being anything less than 5 stars. 

As there are descriptions of most of the food already in other reviews, I'll just list down what I loved, liked, and would pass. 

LOVED:

Garlic Prawns - it's expensive. A chef special. But the shells tasted like a crunchy chip, and the shrimp was fried to perfection. 

Seafood Thai Fried Rice - we actually ordered 2 of this because of the fact that the fried rice was so chunky! They really packed this with big, big pieces of seafood. It was worth it. 

Crispy Duck w/ Panang Curry - Most people order this at at least a 5-8 in spicy level. My group ordered this in a 1. We don't handle spice well, but we still loved it! Although small, the duck was one of the best I've ever had and the curry sauce went will with my fried rice. 

Tom Kah Kai - I've never quite had a soup like it really, or maybe perhaps it was because I don't get Thai very often. The flavors went from tangy to sweet, always leaving you with a bunch of surprises at every gulp. 

Fried Whole Catfish - in my opinion, this was the real winner. We ordered this last minute, needing something BIG to get full (the dishes are small in size). I'm always quite skeptical of ordering catfish as they always end up tasting like mud paddies due to where they are caught. However they raise the catfish themselves, so it tasted amazing. I suggest ordering this first as it takes the longest to cook. 

Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream & Sticky Rice - In the Philippines, we have a similar fried banana called Turon, however it fails in comparison to these. The fried banana didn't taste like it was drenched in glaze and oil. It was also fresh! The coconut ice cream tasted really good. Nothing like those that are store bough. The sticky rice was greatly balanced between too sticky and just plain soggy, a nice meet in the middle. 


LIKED:

Khao Soy - For people who like spicy food, this is a winner for you! As for me, I could only take about 2-3 spoonfuls before my tongue started burning for mercy. However, within those few bites, I loved the flavors it produced, sweeter and mild. We ordered this with chicken, but it was a bit dry. 

Tom Kah Kai - this also had a whole range of flavors to it. Minty, zesty, tangy. All I can say is that it was very complex. An array of flavors, but it was just right. The only thing was that at times, it was a bit too sour for me. 

Pad Thai - the pad Thai was good. Nothing more, nothing less. 

DISLIKED:

Nua Nam Tok - the beef was super dry unless you dip it in the sauce. The problem with this is that the beef is the main spotlight of the dish. Skip it. 

Thai Tea - I have to admit the drink was good. However, there was just so much ice and not enough tea; can you really call this a drink?

In contrast to entering the restaurant with mixed feelings, thinking it was overhyped, we left feeling happy and content. 

Also, kuddos to our waiter (he was the only one in yellow) who patiently dealt with our questions about what's good, not good, and recommended."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, very attentive and accommodating waiters service. the location is questionable but who care, as long as the food and customer service is great, i'll go into the hood!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Lotus of Siam, but I was not blown away.  I've been hearing a lot about this place, but other than the long wait, it doesn't seem that different than other local Thai restaurants.  The pad see ewe was good, and our friends seemed to enjoy their tom kha gai, and pad Thai.  The appetizer chicken wings we ordered  weren't all that.  They were kind of dry, and lacked flavor.  They basically tasted like fried wings with nothing on them, because whatever they were topped with wasn't sticking to them.  They were practically begging for a dipping sauce.  Unfortunately, it was so busy, that I didn't get a chance to ask for anything to add to them.
I would eat here again if I was in the area, and I would like to try their lunch buffet.  For now, this place is just \"okay\"."}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated -- or maybe we ordered the wrong things -- either way, Lotus of Siam did not live up to our expectations! Sure the outside is a little run down but coming from San Francisco, I know that the best places are the small holes in the wall! We ordered an order of the chicken wings, a papaya salad, a tom yum noodle soup.. and the last one I don't remember. It's not bad but I've had better. 

They get 2 stars for the food and an extra star for fitting us in on a Friday night. We were told when we approached the hostess that it's fully booked and we had to wait at least an hour for a table for 4... the hostess then told us to wait 5 minutes and gave us a table!

If you've never had Thai food, this is a good first!"}
{"text":"When I say the best Thai food I have ever had in my life outside of Thailand, I mean it. Lotus of Siam is incredible. Ignore the exterior and weird Vegas strip mall surroundings, you're about to walk into deliciousness. The service, food, and killer wine list are ALL five stars. The restaurant was packed, not an empty seat in the house. I was able to snag a reservation about a month out through their super easy online booking service. We did as Anthony Bourdain suggested and skipped to the Northern Thai specialties and I'm glad we listened to the master. We ordered the following: Khao Soi, Northern Larb, Nam Prik Ong, Sai Oua, and Kang Hung Lay. The Northern Larb is out of this world delicious. Packed with fresh greens and herbs, it was refreshing and spicy and amazing all in one. Our other favorite, Khao Soi, was divine! It's a coconut cream based curry noodle dish that is unbelievable. Their wine selection is insane also. Bring wine enthusiasts, my boyfriend and I felt like we were in wine heaven. Our server helped us pick a fantastic dry Riesling. We will definitely be coming back here next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is as tasty as cotton candy, as authentic as its culture and the food is beyond delicious. There is no place like it West of Missicippi river? Is that how you spell Missiccipi? Server has good attitude. I order S1 it was great. We were in and out in less than 35mn on our way back to LA."}
{"text":"There just is no better place in Vegas to get AUTHENTIC Thai food.  Close friend took my family a few years ago who happens to be from Thailand and wanted us to experience the difference between other places we've tried and Lotus of Siam.  Needless to say, we've become loyal customers.  There is often a wait for a table if going for dinner, so it's best to make reservations.  Lunch is rarely busy, so if you can go mid week, it's probably a great time to try.  You'll soon make reservations for dinner if you do!  The wait staff is not only knowledgeable, but also extremely efficient and helpful to those of us that don't know what to order.  This place does it RIGHT!"}
{"text":"We hit there after the lunch rush. You would never guess from the front of the building that this is such a large restaurant. Coming in, you pass a lot of signed 8 x 10 glossies, Wine Spectator awards, and other testaments to the quality of the food. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the service. We were seated at a table in a very large room that seemed to only have two waiters working the entire section. After 10 minutes of not being acknowledged (you know -- the not-making-eye-contact trick), I had to wave my arms to get some water and attention. By the reviews, this is obviously a very good restaurant. As for the food, the yellow curried chicken that I had was dry. My dining companion even said that it looked dry. The chicken looked like it had been boiled, shredded, and sprinkled with a curry sauce. There were a couple of what could only be described as chicken rinds on the plate. I get it. I probably came at the wrong time and ordered the wrong food. My bad. Would I come at dinner time and wait for hours for a table? I don't know."}
{"text":"The first time i came here, I was heavily underwhelmed.  What did I order? The first two items I saw pop up on Yelp.  Nam kao tod and drunken noodles.  So yes, the nam kao tod is more unique fare than what you get at other thai restaurants but it is FAR from what i would consider crave-worthy.  And wtf, Drunken noodles? Yes they're good, but if you've ever had pad see ew, it's pretty similar and way cheaper at other places.  

So why five stars for this place?? CRISPY DUCK W/ PANANG CURRY and GARLIC PRAWNS!!!! There's a reason I hesitate now whenever I think of going into any other Thai restaurant...  I want those two specific dishes and no one but Lotus of Siam can deliver.  These two dishes combined were life changingly good for me.  Yea they're expensive and yes the portions COULD be larger, but it's pure crack I tell you!  So don't putz around with the other items unless this isn't your first time and you wanna try something different or you somehow don't like crack laced food.  Drooling as i write this review..."}
{"text":"Felt ripped off by chicken rama (recommended by the manager) it is just grilled chicken with satay peanut sauce on the top. 22 dollars. :("}
{"text":"So popular that reservations are hard to get and walk ins can wait up to an hour. For as busy as they are, they need to consider upping their staffing levels and having more servers and less managers walking around with ear pieces looking efficient but not even noticing a party of 5 with no waters, not enough menus (we were given 2 and told that they ran out) and no waiter until at least 10 minutes after we sat down.  
The only person who was attentive after we flagged him down was one of the busers who did keep an eye on us and refill our glasses.

I think our waiter discriminated against us once we put the order in. It was such a small one he obviously felt that his time was better spent at other tables. 

Not a smart move dude. I work with groups and events for a living. I have potential to bring them lots of business.  But only when they get their acts together"}
{"text":"Wow!!! After reading the reviews, I HAD to try it! I got the Panang Curry with Chicken & it was delicious!!! Beware though, they ask how hot you want it (1-10). I love spicy food, so I asked for a 9. Whew! It didn't take away from the taste, but it was super spicy! I think I'd prefer a 7 there, while I ask for a 9 or 10 everywhere else. The only reasons I didn't give a 5 star review is because they were not too attentive to our empty drink glasses & we had to ask for 1 drink twice. Granted, they were pretty busy. I recommend making reservations if you plan on eating here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is off the strip and not the easiest to get to unless you've rented a car or have a propensity to take Uber everywhere. I've heard they get packed with lines out the door. The online reservation system doesn't seem to be the most accurate since they seem to only allocate a certain amount of seats to the online portal. We called in when they opened and they kindly informed us that there were plenty of seats available.

Walking into the restaurant feels like you've entered an Anthony Bourdain rerun. The blatant glass wine cellar that lines the central walkways pose a simple question. Does wine go with Thai food?

I didn't dare to try. Instead, we opted for the Khao Soi with Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns, a side of sticky rice, and for dessert: mango sticky rice.

The Khao Soi is unbelievable. I've been searching far and wide in the West Coast for Northern Thai Khao Soi. The type with the unmistakably scrumptious broth, perfectly cooked wide-egg noodles, and a winged-meat pair served directly inside the creamy dish. In Chiangmai, I caught a bowl of Khao Soi flanked with a chicken leg at the train station and even that was impressively amazing. This bowl of yellow curry noodles is truly a portal into my travels through Northern Thailand. The boneless crispy duck is a flawless touch with just the right amount of crunch and flavor you'd expect from the winged-cousin.

Garlic Prawns are cool. The way they prepare it is rather interesting. They splice the prawn along it's shelled-back and dig out the meat from within the shell. They keep the shell attached to the shelled-fish as they fry it and it becomes a crunchy butterfly. Dressed heavily with garlic and served with a side of rice, this dish was the perfect pair with the curry noodles.

Pro-tip: use the extra curry from the Khao Soi for the Garlic Prawn's rice for a moist addition to the fried dish.

Lastly, the mango sticky rice with coconut cream is the perfect way to end the meal. The juxtaposition of warm coconut rice with a cold mango gives an ice cream dessert a run for its money.

Go here if you've traveled through Northern Thailand. Go here if you want to travel to Northern Thailand. Just Pokemon Go here."}
{"text":"I came here at night for my last Vegas thing before driving back to LA. It was about 8:30PM when I rolled up to this place. My first thought was, \"Wow, this parking lot is sketchy looking.\" There are hardly any street lights. When I parked, I parked next to some Audi that had its front end smashed in and 4 flat tires. Then while walking to the entrance of the restaurant, some very sketchy-looking white male on a bicycle started to make up some story about \"his wife\" then asked for money. We just kept walking because who knows what kind of bicycle shenanigans he might pull off. We put our names down on the decent sized waiting list, went back outside, and moved my car just to get some piece of mind in the dodgy parking lot. It seemed like no one hung around outside of the restaurant which added onto the sketchiness. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for 2 people.

The food was delicious with lots of flavor and textures. We pretty much only ordered from the chef's specialty section:
1) drunken noodle with soft shell crab
2) deep fried garlic prawns
3) nam kao tod

All the food was a little spicy yet yummy. Again, it was my last Vegas thing of the day before heading 3 hours west and I was already awake for a long time gambling and such so I was almost falling asleep in here. Maybe my review would be different if I had more energy or was drinking.

If you plan to check this place out, make a reservation so you can minimize the time your car is in a danger zone. You'll be surprised with how big it is inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai Food I ever eat !!!! The Garlic Shrimp is fried to perfection . You can eat the whole shrimp . Yummm ! Probably my favorite dish . The curry duck was so delicious ! Nam Kao Tod was interesting at first because I never tried anything like it. After couple bites , it was addicting . Chinese Broccoli was good and flavorful.  Thai Tea was good . Overall , the food and service was excellent. Can't wait to try more of their dishes !!!!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest place I have ever eaten.  I have spent time in Thailand and I still never ate anything as good as I have had here.

The only downfall is you will never be able to enjoy Thai food anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Made an reservation so got seated right away. Waited for 30 minutes to get our food which its pretty good because they are I'm sure always busy. You gotta try the crispy Duck Panang! For the portion size, it's a little expensive but worth it! You pay for what you get and I'll pay for it over and over again whenever I'll come here. 

Everything was perfect! Just that after we got our food, they forgot about us. So if you want extra napkins, fork or even rice, make sure to ask all at once! Overall, I love this place! Am going back to try other more dishes!"}
{"text":"Months before our big meet-up in Sin City, my friend had already started an email thread talking about how we HAD to make it to Lotus of Siam somehow. It took a bit of coordination because of our set conference schedule, but we made it and were very happy we did.

We decided to all order something different and eat family style. We had Fried Wontons, Pad Thai, Pad Sw Ew, Yellow Curry, and I'm not sure what it is officially called but they would know if you said the ribs dish. We devoured everything lined in the middle of our table. The ribs dish was my favorite. The meat fell off the bone and was covered in this amazing sauce that was similar to curry. Yellow Curry is also one of my favorite Thai dishes and while Lotus of Siam does it with more kick, it is delicious!

We all walked out with very big bellies and food comas."}
{"text":"Been here before and still a good place to eat.  Food is tasty but portions are a bit on the smaller side. 

Still one of the better local ethnic eateries in Las Vegas. Don't let the somewhat suspect surroundings of this place dissuade you from stopping. 

Good service. Mint & green chili with chicken was very good."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying Northern Thai food and this place didn't disappoint. I love experiencing new flavors, I ate so much!!! The service was very good as well, I'm barely done eating and already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place & is even more charming bc of the humble beginnings! The service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"OMG the food here was amazing!  The outside of the restaurant is deceiving.  Once you squeeze past the tiny entrance, the restaurant opens up and is actually quite large.  I will definitely  return the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Crispy duck in Panang sauce. It will change your life. 

This place is simply amazing. I have now tried about 10 different dishes since I first came here 6 months ago. It's a must see in Vegas. I actually enjoyed eating here more than the buffet at the Wynn. 

I brought two people during my last visit and I can say I made both their lives better. 

Want a better you?  Forget self help books. Just eat here instead, and I promise your life will change for the better."}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite restaurant in Las Vegas after \"Himalayan Cuisine\". The lunch buffet is ok but dinner here is superb. I like smaller friendlier atmospheres and a relaxed ambiance with fantastic food at reasonable prices without the pretense thats usually displayed at a lot of sub par casino restaurants. I really like the house special flat noodles with crawfish. Their wine list is fantastic and much more reasonably priced than other places that boast great wine lists. Alas, the beer is limited to the standard weak Asian lagers and domestics, but if its fantastic beers I want I just go to the Himalayan Cuisine instead. The sommelier here is a very affable man and after chatting him up I was able to twist his arm and offer him a little taster of the Bergstrom Pinot Noir I had one night. All in all, fantastic Thai food that deserves its well-reviewed reputation, great wine list, friendly wait-staff that doesn't stand on ceremony, bland beer selection and decent but not necessarily fantastic lunch buffet."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Vegas. 

If you can pull your party off the strip, get to this restaurant, you will thank me. 

Piece of advice...make dinner reservations WELL in advance. It takes at least a week to get your preferred date and time. 

Garlic prawns are on the money. 

Crispy duck...you can't get any better."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is amazing! The pad thai is to die for. Service is good. There's always a lot of people waiting but it is definitely worth the wait. I'm so glad I found this place.. It's become a tradition to eat here whenever I have friends in town."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best Thai restaurants in the US. Be forewarned - make a reservation or be prepared to grow old waiting. Skip the standards and focus on the Northern Thai items, truly exceptional"}
{"text":"The real reason I go to Las Vegas! Pay attention to the Northern Thai dishes - here is where they really excel. Oh, and make a reservation :-)"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch.  The northern Thai food was really tasty.  The heat was just right.  The price is right.  The atmosphere was not as good as the food.  The acoustics were a little noisy, given the number of people.  It's one of the best Thai places I have visited for food.  Atmosphere gives it 3 stars instead of 5.  The food is 5 star.  Average between the two is 4.  I really want to give it 5 star because the food is so good, but the dining room pulls it down."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I have to do this, but it must be said so here we go~

I came in the other day with bae and some friends. The wait was about an hour at 8:40, and we finally got seated at around 9:50. The kitchen was going to close in 10 minutes, so we were encouraged to order quickly. We ordered boat noodle soup, duck panang, duck khao soi, garlic prawns, pad Thai, a soup dish, and another duck dish.

Minutes go by as previous tables get their order before us, and some of the non-duck dishes became present on our table. We shrugged at the thought that other tables seemed to get their appetizers before us, though we ordered prior to them. Our friends told us to just go ahead and eat, as they anticipated their food to arrive. 

As 30 minutes go by, and all but the duck dishes arrived, we inquired about the missing dishes. The time was already past 10pm, and the kitchen had closed. The given answer was that they ran out of duck, so my friends dishes weren't available to them, nor were they even given a heads up. 

After everyone had gotten their order but the friends who settled for duck, only AFTER WE INQUIRED were we even given an explanation. And by this time, the kitchen had closed so there was no other alternative but starve.

See this is where it gets unacceptable. A restaurant such as Lotus that is NOT a new establishment with thousands of customers  and (generally) good service (the times I've been) turned a new leaf (badumtshh). If the kitchen is closing, shouldn't the servers  been told that they were running out of supplies ? If they weren't, how come they were not informed? That's the main idea between the kitchen and crew - communication. There was no communication that night that indefinitely lead to unpleased patrons. Normally when you order and it's near the end of the night, the server should give you a heads up that some items are low, or if you order said product, they would offer to go to the kitchen to ask - but no! That was definitely  not the case. 

That's very uncool and incredibly unprofessional of the staff to not even give us the detail that they're out of duck. When the server tried to alleviate the situation with free dessert, that made us even more aggravated. Yeah, I'm seeing that you're trying to make things right, but it's just not fair to offer dessert when my friends didn't even get DINNER.

Honestly I'm really flabbergasted that Lotus would provide this type of service. We got our drinks taken off (after they were put on the bill, though they were ordered and paid for at the bar). Literally every other table got their food before us, and we ordered before them. There wasn't any sort of compensation for next time and I'm so sorry to my friends who were incredibly hyped for this meal when they received nothing but a dessert offer despite ordering an actual dish."}
{"text":"Very good thai food place. This place is hidden and located at a ghetto looking abandoned area lol but its okay. It looks shady and small outside but its spacey inside. Food was great, abit pricey but toure paying for the quality so its okay! Will come back again."}
{"text":"ce resto , faut savoir qu'il existe car il est en plein dowtown Vegas , mais quel endroit ! Impressionnant les célébrités venues diner ici , d'hilary clinton à Bush , tout le gratin politico / médiatique est passé par là . La carte est énorme , une dizaine de page , spécialité du nord de la Thaïlande , fréquenté par des thaï ce qui est bon signe , la carte des vins incroyable( 7 pages) on trouve des bouteilles à partir de 40$ mais ça peut atteindre des sommets avec des crus millésimés à plus de 10.000$ !

{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I have ever eaten in USA! :)
I went there with my parents before going back to LA
and we ordered the green papaya salad which is really GOOD, we even a second serving for to go :P!!!
We also order drunken noodle with duck, tom yum soup, and seabass with suki sauce(forgot the actual name). They are all really good!!
I am not sure about the authenticity of this place but the taste is hella GOOD!! The price is kinda on the higher side but they are worth it!!
Definitely gonna visit there again when I go to Vegas again :).
This place is kinda hidden( I almost missed it!) but they have a really big parking space so parking is not a problem here. They also have lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Asian food in general and love Thai food. I was visiting from Texas and figured I would try the hot spots in Vegas. This was our first stop after landing so you know I was excited and starving. We ordered the food to-go and headed to the hotel with the goods. I read that the wait can be crazy so I figured I would save ourselves the time.

So I decided to order the duck panang, crab fried rice and garlic prawns. The crab fried rice was exactly as expected and delicious. The garlic prawns had a nice crunch but were quite greasy. The duck panang was probably my favorite of them all. The duck was cooked well and the curry that accompanied the dish was phenomenal. I could probably pour it on any and everything and be satisfied. 

Now let's talk about cost of food. I really don't think it was worth the money. I know Vegas can be kind of expensive to begin with but this is Thai food not steak. I paid somewhere in the mid $70's and was pretty surprised. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but not $70 good. The crab fried rice was the only normal priced item we ordered. I'm glad I was able to try the restaurant but this was a one and done for me."}
{"text":"We had a group of 14 and they accommodated us.  We had the yellow curry, red curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles, sea bass, egg plant, and Thai fried rice.  The food was real tasty, but the portions were kind of small, hence the 4 star and not 5.  Overall, recommended for an off the strip location."}
{"text":"Right up there for best Thai food in America.  In stead of hitting up the latest NY-chef, 1-weekend-a-month restaurant casino restaurant, catch a cab and hit the strip mall."}
{"text":"The best Thai outside of Thailand. The raw prawns with delectable spicy sauce, their version of beef tartare, the curries, pad thai, and tom yum soups, all perfectly delicious. Thai iced tea washes it all down wondrously. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Driving up to the place, I've already had my biases.. it's located in a run down strip mall. Homeless people hanging out in the parking lot. I've already made up my mind that this can't be any good... and then the 40 minute wait. It has too be good, right? Packed on a Friday night. It must be good. Still questioning our dinner choice, we decided to wait.

Looking at the menu, dishes were on the pricey side. Then I saw too many westerners to think this would be any good. While we waited, we watched dishes coming out and the portions looked tiny. The garlic prawns were $29! And the plate didn't even look that full. 

I would pass on the garlic prawns and the drunken noodles.
But the pad thai..... Possibly the best pad thai I've ever tasted!

Was it worth the wait? Between 3 dishes, only one was a hit."}
{"text":"epic thai madness

Wins: deep fried whole lobster, green curry, riesling. 
Fails: none"}
{"text":"It's right off the strip and pretty easy to find. The shopping center is pretty dingy and run down but don't worry, you are in the right place.  Because most of the other shops are out of business,  there is plenty of parking. If you don't make a reservation, the wait can be pretty long. 

On to the positive things about it, lol. Like it's known for, there are a ton of pictures of famous people that have been there that line walls - my family enjoyed them. Our waiter was really nice and patient, he had to come around a couple times before we had of order ready. For the amount of food we ordered, it came out very quickly. You can tell they don't take any short cut with the food here, you can taste the quality of the ingredients and the layers of flavors in each dish. My mom and aunts are very good cooks and have cooked some of the same dishes before and they're very comparable - meaning it's got the homemade taste and quality to it, because the cooks in my family go all of and don't skimp on anything just to save money. And lastly, the food was very reasonably priced. We had a large group but it didn't cost as much as I'd anticipated."}
{"text":"I came here with some high expectations, since this restaurant is claimed to be the best Thai food in the world! I'm not sure about that. I found that it was strange to have a restaurant so acclaimed at a really ghetto Asian plaza, mostly dominated by Korean businesses. I'm still very surprised that famous Food Network Chefs came to this restaurant and featured it. With all that publicity, you would think that they would move to a bigger place. I found it to be a bit crowded.

My friends and I decided to go here after class for their buffet. The price for it was 8.99. It's pretty good quality of Thai food. I wasn't blown away, but what do you expect of a buffet style restaurant? My favorite dish had to be the soup Tom Kha, the vegetarian coconut milk soup. Otherwise, there was nothing special about the other dishes. 

Maybe dinner would be a lot better. Next time I will try their whole catfish dish or any other dish that was featured by Gourmet magazine..."}
{"text":"A few friends had recommended Lotus of Siam a while back, and we just recently dined here. We usually order traditional Thai food like Chicken Sa-Tay, Pad Thai, Green Curry with chicken and a deep fried whole fish, so we wanted to experinece some new flavors from *Northern Thai food. 

1) *Khao Soi - crispy duck with egg noodles in  curry base sauce
2) *Garlic Prawns - deep fried prawns with shells sauteed with garlic sauce & ground black pepper.
3) Tom Yum Kai - hot and sour soup with chicken, lime, lemon grass & mushrooms
4) Shrimp Fried Rice

The restaurant looks deceiving from the outside in a strip mall, but the place is huge inside and was very busy. The food was authentic, fresh and full of unique flavors."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my brothers a few weeks back. We wanted to try a place off the strip & had heard about LofS. We were starving but it's a quick cab ride from the northern end of Las Vegas Blvd. so we arrived in less than 5 minutes. Once inside, the short wait for our table naturally led us to their bar for beer & sake. 

Immediately after getting our drinks we were seated & ordered a bunch of food to share. It was so delicious that half way thru our meal we ordered more to take back to our room for the following day! Haha! 

The guys at the table next to us were regulars. They told us some really funny stories about the restaurant. And as they were leaving they gave us an expensive bottle of sake they hadn't opened. Score! It was soo smooth too! After our entrees we were full but had to order dessert. We ate like pigs! 

If you want to leave the strip for a few hours to relax in a different environment I really recommend LofS. The food is fantastic, the staff is very friendly, the mix of good people is diverse and it's all pretty inexpensive. I can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"It's hard to find anything to dislike about this celebrated institution of Thai food in Las Vegas. The fried shrimp, the wine selection, the staff... the only thing to dislike is the wait to get in, but usually it's a lot easier than that first, awful, notice of \"well... 30 minutes?\"
Especially when you can smell what's going on inside... Oh my god.
The really, really good news is that there is very, very good Thai food just a stone's throw away at Komol. It's not Lotus,  but really, aren't we all about packing some delish calories?"}
{"text":"Long wait for a table.  I heard of the place from a friend.  The food was good with a large variety of dishes to choose.  The one problem I had was the service.  Once seated, I waited long time for my waiter to order more food after the initial order and he was not anywhere to be found.  So I asked another waiter to help; but he refused.  His explanation was that my table was not for him to serve;  Then he walked away..  I was just speechless! This is what happens when someone goes to a restaurant with too many customers to serve."}
{"text":"Good gaaaaaawd, this place never fails. Unless the wait is like 4 hours on a Sunday like the last time my boyfriend and I went here. I don't blame them though; I would probably wait 4 hours if I didn't have to be back in LA that night  

This place is simply amazing. Very authentic Thai food. I'm from LA, and LA is known to have a lot of amazing Thai places but none of them compare to Lotus. The restaurant is huge, and they have a bar that offers everything from wine to sake & beer. Over the years they've expanded the space to probably accommodate the amount of people they serve each day.

Here is what we ordered:

Crispy Prawns in Garlic
It's as amazing as it sounds. When they say crispy, they mean crispy! You can actually eat the shrimp skin. It's like chips. Try it, you won't regret.

Crispy Duck Panang
Here's the thing: I don't eat duck. I'm not sure why, but I just kinda feel weird about eating it. However, this dish is an exception. The duck is so crispy, and the sauce is so good and has the perfect kick. I wish all duck dishes could taste as good as this. Have it with white rice and you're a winner without hitting it big on the strip.

Pad see ew 
My 1st love. 
Best pad see ew that I have ever had. It's simple, not too oily, not too dry and a lot of flavor. The beef: tender! 

Another thing to note about this place is the service. Despite that the girl at the front desk isn't very personable or quick to greet guests, the waiters and the waitresses make up for it. They really want you to enjoy their food. Never was my glass empty. 

THANK YOU LOTUS OF SIAM FOR ANOTHER AMAZING EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Always a stop when we visit Las Vegas. The food is delicious and the flavors are authentic. We love the Khoa soi and soft shell crab appetizer."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. I make it a point to come here every time I'm in Vegas. The service is always top notch and it seems all the servers have great suggestions for the bold adventurous types to the same Ol same Ol. We tried to book a reservation on a Saturday and they were booked till the following Wednesday. No worries, we walked in around 8pm on Monday. We were told 1.5hrs, again no problem it's worth the wait. In less than an hour we had our table. We all did a family style dinner, some rated at 3, others like my self have to go a little higher like a 7. The food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit for lunch. It wasn't as great as everyone preaches. 

Grilled beef with rice powder- decent, nothing super exciting. A little too much mint

Whole catfish- the best dish since it was tender with crunchy skin and the sauce is savory, spicy and sweet. 

Som thom- papaya salad- no dried shrimp or crab. Very basic

Drunken noodles- a little oily and too overlooked so the noodles were mushy.

Whole hen- it actually was reg chicken- that's what the waiter said. The flavor was really nice but the chicken was so tiny and a little dry. 

***the rice was dry and old. I don't understand why restaurants serve horrible rice when in Asia it's a staple and considered a main course not a condiment or complimentary side. It makes such a huge difference eating good rice. 

The meal came out to $100. The portions were tiny other than the catfish."}
{"text":"They have the BEST Orange Chicken you've ever tasted!!! I know its not a Chinese Restaurant, but it doesn't matter... This is a MUST visit restaurant the next time you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable first time dinner at Lotus of Siam. We were a party of 2 and I took the advice of other Yelpers and made reservations to avoid the infamous wait times. I've been wanting to eat here ever since the good prophet Mr. Anthony Bourdain sang its praises many seasons ago on his show. Northern Thai cuisine he said. He said go straight to the back of the menu where all these Northern specialties are found. That I did...

We were seated right when we walked in as I had told them we had reservations. We were seated near the wine room. First impression of Lotus of Siam was that it is big and it is busy. Very busy. Our reservations were for 8pm so there wasnt a big group of people waiting outside to be seated but there were some.

We ordered the khao soi crispy duck ($26.95) and the garlic prawns ($27.95) as suggested and urged by Anthony Bourdain. He was not lying. The duck is so crispy and delicious. That first bite was something else. Wowww.... Amazing. The egg noodles & perfectly crispy duck on top of that curry & coconut cream was a delicious combination. Now I know what the fuss is all about. So good... We also ordered the garlic prawns. They were crispy and deliciously fried still in their shell split in half. You have to get it. It was also so very good. Aside from those 2 dishes we just had white rice to accompany them and we were golden. That's all we needed. A glass of wine for the lady. A soda for me... Sa-tis-fied..

Service was decent. Felt a little rushed at first as we were total rookies but they warmed up after a while and turned out to be attentive and friendly. I cant wait to go back to Lotus of Siam the next time we're in town.

Parking is in a big shared lot. It is kind of dark once the sun goes down. Make reservations. It's a must. And order what Anthony Bourdain tells you. Always..."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas multiple times and I finally got a chance to try this place and wow, the food here is amazing! If you had to order just one thing, it would be the soft shell crab drunken noodles. That's all you need.

We ordered:

1. Soft Shell Crab drunken noodles - AMAZING. This is one of the very few places where I've tried authentic delicious soft shell crab. They used the right amount of batter to give you that perfect crispy texture! The sauce for the noodles was addicting (hehe, drunken noodles), and everything tasted great! A must try! So worth the $23! (5/5)

2. Pad-see-ewe - The noodles tasted great, and the seasonings were spot on with the beef. One of the best ones I've tasted. But my heart still goes with the Soft Shell Crab drunken noodles. (5/5)

Credit cards are accepted. Plenty of parking. Service is friendly. If I'm ever craving Thai food in Vegas, I would definitely come here again! =)"}
{"text":"I think it's the best Thai in Las Vegas. Huge menu -- fresh ingredients -- expertly prepared. Impeccable service. Don't care for the physical location though. Not the best part of town. My wife and I go late afternoon/early evening only. If you're new to Thai, don't go higher than '2' on their spice scale unless you're a fire breathing dragon."}
{"text":"a good thai restaurant. but definitely not more than an hour wait long kind of good. plenty of empty tables but would seat us or anyone for over an hour. what is the real hype?"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. Everything we ordered was phenomenal, garlic prawns, duck curry, soft shell crab drunken noodles, the off the menu lamb, coconut chicken soup, larb..."}
{"text":"Before going to Las Vegas, i've followed some review on Yelp and it helped. My family and I are original Thai, we were expected to eat real Thai foods, and this restaurant was so awesome, Wines are great as well."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when they have a wall of pictures of celebrities that have eaten there. The food was mostly great but be warned: it can be VERY spicy. Like authentic Thai spicy. I got my panang crispy duck at a spiciness level of 7 (out of 10) and it was ridiculous. And I can usually take a good amount of spice. My mouth was on fire halfway through the meal and I couldn't finish it all. Get 5 or less unless you want a stomach ulcer the next day. The crispy duck was delicious though. Oh and it didn't come with ride but one of my friends ordered rice and it came in a huge bucket enough to feed 5.

The satay appetizer was also very, very good. The peanut sauce was wonderful. We also ordered some Thai rice as an appetizer to share. I can't remember the name but it was super salty and not very good. I also tried the garlic prawns that everyone raves about but I didn't really like it to be honest. The shells do taste like potato chips but it's $30 potato chips."}
{"text":"This super famous Thai restaurant has been called the best Thai restaurant in the country.  I've been here quite a few times and the most important advice I have is to skip the buffet (don't even look at it or you'll be tempted) and order off the Northern Thai menu.  I recently had the Nam Kao Tod as appetizer-crispy rice noodles with some kind of delicious meat mixed in with the noodles.  My entrée was Kho Soy  (Steak Tar Tar), which was flavorful and delicious.  My wife had the Kho Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles with Spare Ribs).  This restaurant is consistently delicious and there are many other items I am looking forward to trying on their Northern Thai menu.  The service is always helpful and the prices are reasonable.  My only complaint with Lotus of Siam is they recently quit accepting American Express, which is the only card I like to use in restaurants.  The ambiance is comfortable and inviting, but I've never eaten in the new seating area.  Food-5 stars, Service-4 stars, Ambiance-3 Stars, Value-5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Vegas... baby!  Try to time your visit to be at a non-peak time so don't have to wait so long for a table, as it gets busy here.  

The chicken pad thai was extraordinary!  Overall, prices are very reasonable (especially for a busy restaurant in Las Vegas). 

I have been here right as they were closing and they held the kitchen open until I got my order in.  Now that's service!  Will be sure to return.  

Lotus of Siam, if I ever become a famous songwriter, then I will write a song just for you!"}
{"text":"Their service is supreme.
Ordered the tom yum soup and it was good- way too spicy for what was asked for.
The Sliced Spicy Beef with Thai Eggplant Salad was the real shining star. That was fresh and clean and fantastic."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food Ever! Best Seafood Soup! Must try Pad Se Ew with beef it's the best. Fried Prawns are delicious! I love this place it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Have to give credit for their consistency.  If you are looking for a fancy, romantic Thai restaurant, this place may not be for you.  The lighting is bright, carpet tired, and location in a functionally obsolete shopping center is terrible...the food and service are fantastic.  This place is becoming a Vegas institution for off strip eats.  I highly recommend it, have been here twice and will be back again.  Last visit I had the drunken noodles with shrimp, awesome!"}
{"text":"Not great food and over price for what you get. Not sure why there was so much hype for the place.  Crispy duck $27 buck ouch."}
{"text":"Odd little strip mall way off the strip but SO worth it. Everything is done beyond well. My personal favorites are the salmon in red curry w/ cognac and the shrimp. Avoid the typical dishes you'd order at a less stellar Thai restaurant and try what these people do best!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a long time. This place is off the strip in a shady looking strip mall, but well worth the trip. I hear it can go from \"shady\" to \"seedy\" at night. We went there on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and had no wait to get a table. We had the Tom Yum Kai (hot and sour soup with chicken and lemon grass) and it was one of the best I've ever had. They asked us how spicy on a 1-10 scale. We said 5, and I'm glad I didn't go over that, because it was definitely spicy - not unpleasantly so, but I would probably order a 3 or 4 next time.

For main courses we got the Garlic Prawns which are as good (if not better) than all the reviews say. The prawns are fried with the shells still on them, and they get crispy \"like potato chips\" according to the menu, and are super tasty. We also ordered the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles. There were only a couple pieces of duck that were actually \"crispy,\" but wow was it tasty. 

The only problem with it being off the strip is that it took us ONE HOUR to get a cab to pick us up. Some of the cab companies said they wouldn't even pick us up. I would recommend driving yourself as there's plenty of parking. If you do take a cab or uber, I would recommend calling them before you even ask for your bill, because it might take a while. The food is so good, I'm still giving it 5 stars though. 

I will come back here each and every time I go to Vegas so I can try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Some of the Best Thai Food I have had on the West Coast so far.
They have huge menu that takes some time to read.

Crispy Duck Penang
Very Good

Pik KIng Shrimp
Very Good

I had several other items that were also very good, but cannot remember the names.

The only downside to Lotus of Siam is that it is not in walking range of the strip and it is so popular that the wait to get in can be long."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food Restaurant around. I had the pleasure of finally going to Lotus in Valentines Day. Im so glad we ate at this restaurant. The wait was long but it was worth it. The service was great. The food was on point.
Even though the place was packed the food still came out piping hot. My suggestion is to always make a reservation."}
{"text":"The crispy duck panang is just amazing. The reviews, just like the flavors of this restaurant's food, is right on point. A bit pricey imo but glad I tried it. Also ordered the pad see ew which was so flavorful. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Shady strip mall location is the only downside. This places is like no other, they have won many awards including best Thai food in USA and rated best Thai food hands down. Plenty of options, prices are ok, but given the location I would expect slightly cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has a plethora of amazing dishes!

There's literally something for everyone. The garlic prawns are AMAZING (I know everyone talks about it) and pretty much anything else you pick on the menu is pretty delicious as well.

Highly recommend making a reservation because they have long wait times especially when there are big events or weekends. 

If you're down to wait, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are deciding what great Thai place to go to this evening I would definitely choose 

*** Chada Thai & Wine ***
or
*** Thai Street Cafe ***
over Lotus anyday. I'd have to say I was disappointed with the quality, size portion, and pricing at Lotus. Specifially for the portion and quality, it's one of those places that's Overrated. 

Apps- we got the #14 Nam Kao Tod because everyone was raving about it on Yelp. I found it to be small in portion and very very salty. Also they doused it In way too many limes, that's all I could taste. 

Main Courses- my date and I chose to split the Roasted Duck Curry (4/5 stars - Chada has better duck dishes though)  & Shrimp Pad Thai (4/5 stars)- can't really mess up pad Thai. 

Dessert - mango sticky rice 5/5 stars  Yum

Overall it was a delicious place for dinner but for $80-100 I would chose somewhere else. 

Also - my date and I both had stomach aches for 2 hours after we both ate and fiery bowel movements lol . I'm asain and my date and I both love spicy foods but we've never had any unpleasantness leaving Thai or spicy places. So I'm not sure if it was the spice or the food, we only got a standard 6/10 which is pretty much mild. Didn't taste that spicy either, but we had cramps all night. Beware."}
{"text":"Just finished up here. I have to say I loved it! My grandmother is from Thailand, as is my mom. And with a couple of the dishes I tried I may have to lie to them about who's is better!

We started off with the Chicken Sa-Tay with peanut sauce. The dish came out beautifully with hot chicken that was perfectly spiced. 

Our main course consisted of Beef Larb, Chicken Panang Curry, and Kai Koowah. 

The Beef Larb we got at a spice level of 8/10 and it was perfect. Great flavor, the spices came together well and what always sets good Larb apart in my opinion is the ability to taste the lime coming through all of the spices. 

The Chicken Panang Curry at a 7/10 spice level brought some real heat. I love spicy foods and found that spice level to be just right. I really loved how sutras the coconut was in it and what really impressed me was the taste of the bell peppers. Something about them really stood out and complimented the Chicken and the curry sauce in a pleasing way. 

Finally the Kai Koowah. It had no spice to it and we weren't offered a spice level. At first I was upset about that but when we paired it with the rest of our meal I found it to be a perfect compliment to all of the heat that came with the other two dishes. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the chicken, like in the other dishes was well cooked. The flat noodle dish was a nice relief after eating such spicy things such as the Panang and Larb, leaving you with a mildly sweet taste in your mouth from the noodles. It cleansed my mouth of all of the spicy and really let me taste all of the food I was eating. 

All in all the restaurant was great. Coming from someone who frequently eats authentic Thai and Lao food cooked from my grandmother and mother (hard to beat)  I find it hard to believe the lower rated reviews. This is a place I would definitely recommend to anyone. I look forward to returning there next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuum, this place is great! I came here during a weekday so there was no wait, but still a lot of patrons! So be careful if you're going to come here during the weekend. By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!

The food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.

I love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it."}
{"text":"Searching for best food to eat at Las Vegas. I was intrigued by Lotus of Siam. The reviews, history, pictures, awards everything sounds great. I called in and out of my surprise, I made a reservation. 

Following my GPS, I was a bit panicked because it directed me through the back of the building which was very dingy. I kept driving to look for a sign of human. Found the place and walked into a beautiful humongous restaurant full with people. .

 Dine in :
Duck panang: Very, very good. The panang sauce was amazing. The duck was okay. I never eaten a panang before, even if I did, maybe not that good enough to make me remember it. But this duck panang was excellent.

Tom kha Gai : One of the best Tom kha Gai I ever had. The sourness and the aroma was well blended.
 
Larb : Different from what I used to eat at Thai town Los Angeles.

Seafood drunken noodle : Not happy with this one. It was soggy, soupy, and clumpy. I asked for Thai spicy, it wasn't spicy enough. More like mild medium Thai spicy. 2prawns, 2 green mussels, 1 scallop and 2 big imitation crab meat. 

White rice.

Togo : pineapple fried rice. When we almost finished our dinner, we ordered a pineapple fried rice for to go. We waited for a long time for this. Almost an hour. 

My reservation time was 8:30p.m. 
They were 3-4 parties waiting for tables when my party got in around 8:15p.m By the time we ordered this rice  it was around 8:50p.m. we got the rice approximately 9:40 p.m. 

We asked so many waiters to check the pineapple fried rice. All say yes, went in to check but none come back to tell us. Trying not to spoiled the vacation, we were still in a happy mood. I started to get up and actually read articles on the walls. Then we went back to our hotel with the pineapple fried rice.

Icing on the cake. The fried rice was tasteless. Hold on. Let me correct myself. The pineapple fried rice was very fragrant, when I open the box, it smells so good, but, it has no taste, not salty not sweet And..... the chicken was undercooked. What? How?  I waited for so long for this fried rice. supposed to be perfect. -_-.

I'll post the pictures later. 

I should have known. I'm from L.A. we have wonderful authentic Thai food to choose from. What I want to say is, good experience but once is enough."}
{"text":"We had a feast at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas.

Definitely worth a trip off the strip.

The ambience reminds me of Chinese dim sum houses with expansive floors and lots of tables- though the staff and cuisine are distinctly Thai. I mention the space because whenever I'd read about Lotus of Siam I imagined a smaller, fluorescently lit, retail window looking space and its much more inviting than what I imagined.

Quick run down on what we had and enjoyed:
* Chang Beer
* Duck Curry
* Deep-Fried Red Snapper with Sweet Chili Sauce
* Deep-Fried Red Snaper with Panaang
* Deep-Fried Sea Bass with Ginger
* Short Rib
* Drunken Noodles with Soft Shelled Crab
* A rice dish with great heat and flavor
* Beef Jerky (a challenge for the jaws, only dish I don't recommend)
* Mango and Sticky Rice

Everything was delicious.  Gives Los Angeles Thai places a run for their money."}
{"text":"Had the chicken basil. I had a spice level 7 (out of 10). It was the weakest 7 I've had. The spice level they served me would have been perfectly safe to put in the buffet at a nursing home.

Pretty good, not great. Friendly service, the ingredients were mostly good, chicken was not the best I've had.  Based upon the reviews, I was hoping to be blown away, but not so much. I'd say it's a good Thai place - not amazing. I eat a shit-ton of Thai*, so I'm probably just a Thai snob. If I get back to Vegas I'll try the pad Thai, that's an easier dish.


*My way of bragging about my food-worldliness, is it working?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Lotus of Siam once a year for 20 years on an annual business trip. This trip I discovered that they had moved which was welcome news. Come on fans, let's face it. Their other location was not just quaint. It was a dive. The new place by comparison is beautiful. I didn't have reservations tonight and so it took about 45 minutes to get seated but the waiter was very attentive and so I had high hopes that I would have another great meal. Unfortunately it was not quite at the high high level it normally is. My bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer took quite a long time to come out. The waiter explained that they had to run out and so were making some more. I suspect that caused them to try and rush because the shrimp that finally came out were very slightly overcooked and a tad tough. I asked them to make sure and hold the main course until I finish the appetizer which they did, but when my broiled scallops came out they were not hot. I sent them back to be heated but unfortunately they left the rice at the table. So when the scallops came back rice was cold. And the waiter dashed off before I could catch him to ask for more rice. I was to 2 scallops down before I finally got some more rice. The combination was ultimately delicious but the travails getting there definitely distracted. I'm still giving them four stars because it was that good. They were just not quite on their game tonight. Even so I will definitely be back to the Lotus of Siam, hopefully again and again."}
{"text":"Mom and I decided to give this place a try when multiple people we know recommended it as being their favorite Thai place...ever.  My true rating is about 3.5.

So we went for a leisurely lunch at around 11:40am Friday.  Business was just starting to ramp up.  We were seated at a tiny two-top...BOO...which I always hate especially when I see other parties of two sitting at 4-tops.  Not conducive to us ordering so many dishes...

We started with the papaya salad and pork larb (my must-have at any Thai place).  The dressing for the papaya salad was a little too sweet for my taste, and my fork got all sticky.  The larb was an excellent version.  Both portions were very skimpy.

For entrees, we ordered what most people on Yelp recommended - the crispy duck panang and garlic prawns.  We also got the Thai fried rice w/ beef.  The garlic prawns, I have to say, were amazing.  I expected them to be like the Chinese version, deep fried with scallions and peppers on top.  However, these were a step above...with the shell still attached and well-deep fried so you can munch on it separately from the shrimp itself.  Great flavor.

I have to say that while the crispy duck panang was delicious, the dish was kind of a let-down.  When I saw crispy duck, I thought maybe it was the roasted version with crispy skin...mmm.  However, this version turned out to be breaded and deep fried.  The breading was a little thick, especially when some of the pieces were smaller and you were eating mostly breading.  Not sure if this was worth the $28 price tag.  The garlic prawn definitely was.

Thai fried rice was tasty but I can't say if it was better than any other version I've had.

Service was actually pretty good except when the servers, even when faced with the Tetris challenge of finding space on our tiny table for all our food, opted to place the dishes in awkward spots like at our elbows rather than move us to a bigger table (of which many were available).  Waters were refilled and people were generally smiley.

Tasty lunch with a little bit of leftovers which were delicious cold that afternoon in our hotel room!  Good version of Thai, would be a great option if you had a hankering."}
{"text":"awesome and authentic- You want to try this!  We went without reservations and it was worth the wait-- looks like the out-of-towners of found this place and are turning it into a Mecca for Thai"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty but perhaps not as much as our previous visit a few years ago. The dishes were a bit blander. The pork rib appetizer was good (but not exceptional). The duck curry was tasty but a bit bland, Soft shell crab was also tasty. We had specified medium spicy bit was not spicy at all. They also served my hot tea cold. Maybe an off day."}
{"text":"Took a party of 6 for lunch. Had heard such rave reviews about this place. We were seated immediately. However, the service was horrible. The waitress had a real attitude and did't seem to want to be bothered with us. We are not overly familliar with Thai food and had many questions. The waitress didn't really seem to want to be botered. The foods we ordered were marginal at best. Just not a real pleasant experience. Will go elsewhere next time. No return trip to this restaurant."}
{"text":"With the hype this place gets from the Food Network you would think it was the best thing in the world ...but if you've ever had other Food Network recommends (I'm look at you Fieri) you'll come to see it's mostly crap.

The biggest issue I have with this place is price....and really I can't blame them.

Being Asian and coming from an Asian family that used to own their own fast food restaurant makes you look at Asian food differently.  More specifically, how much you spend on the food.

I have a big pet peeve about paying top dollar for cheap food and this place is exactly that.  It's just like high end Mexican food where people for some reason to agree to pay $20/plate for rice, beans, and some enchiladas.  It's rice and beans people! 

Anyway, we tried the highest recommend.  Garlic Prawn, Duck Panang, fried bananas, nam kao tod, and mee krob.

Although all of it was good, I sat there at the end thinking, \"did i just pay $100 for all this when it's just decent Thai food?\"

There are quite a few Thai places in Vegas that serve food just as good as Lotus, but your bill will be half as much.  Save your money, it's not that great."}
{"text":"I haven't tasted Thai so good since Thailand. That must tell you something. This place offers excellent food at excellent prices, especially for LV.  The menu is extensive but everything seems to be good.  

I'd come back in a heartbeat.  We got the sea bass drunken noodles which, like, blew my mind how flavorful the dish was. I am still dreaming about it weeks later.  It's a tad pricey but trust me, just get this.

We also had stuffed chicken wings stuffed with ground pork, deep fried, served with homemade sweet & sour sauce - excellent

Tom Kah Kai (Bangkok Style)-A distinctive soup of sliced
chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom galanga, lemon
grass and a touch of lime juice - excellent 

Green curry with beef, coconut cream, bamboo shoot. Very good."}
{"text":"********************* 1303 **********************

     Before the James Beard Award and the Gourmet Magazine review, Lotus of Siam was a small little hole in the wall located in Commercial Center in Las Vegas.  You got to take a cab drive to this ghetto side of town, but you will enjoy it and get your Thai fix here. 

- Nam Kao Tod - crispy rice salad, minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice - so good!

- Miang Kham - It is often sold in the street, with the ingredients wrapped separately in small plastic bags.  Filled with roasted coconut shavings and the following main ingredients chopped or cut into small pieces: Shallots, Fresh red or green bird's eye chili peppers, Ginger, Garlic, Lime - hit the spot.

- WOON SEN SOUP - Cellophane noodles with minced chicken, sliced black mushrooms and onion in clear broth.

- Yum Woon Sen - Cellophane noodles, onions, with combination of seafoods mixed with chili and lime juice. Served on bed of greens. 1 of my favorite dishes here.

- LARB KOONG OR PLAR DOOK - catfish or shrimp - Minced shrimp or catfish, chopped onions, fresh and dry chilis, lime juice. Served with fresh cabbage. Delicous.

- GINGER FISH Deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger, onions, and black mushroom sauce. Oh how it hits the spot!

    Amazing wine selection of Riesling KABINETT, SPÄTLESE, AUSLESE, you name it they have it, and also by the glass as well.

   I also love to come here for the lunch buffet when I'm attending CES. Too bad they discontinued the buffet now ;-( Service is always good, reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to try this place after seeing Anthony Bourdain dined here.

The hype is real. I love Thai food, but the options here are more unique and the menu is extensive!

The Drunken Noodles Topped with Duck and the Pepper Fried Prawns were amazingly delicious. Everything was piping hot, fresh, and super flavorful.. not just slabbed in sauce or deep fried in batter.

Overall, I would say this place is optimal for larger parties, ideally 4-6 people. We had 10+ people and it was great ordering dozens of dishes and sharing family style. But, I would imagine for a pair - it would be more challenging to try all the variety of dishes!

Inexpensive and absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"I found Lotus of Siam in Zagat's list of top rated restaurants in Las Vegas. A quick lookup on Yelp showed that it had a pretty good rating with 2000+ reviews so I decided to try it when I was in Vegas a couple of days ago. We tried calling them at around 7 pm to make a reservation but could not get through as their phone was constantly busy. We decided to take a chance and landed up at around 8:30 pm. To my surprise I found that Lotus of Siam was located next door to the now defunct Namaste Indian Cuisine a place that I had been too many times when it was open. Anyway even on a Monday evening they were completely packed and had a wait time of 45 minutes which stretched to almost an hour before we were seated. The restaurant is not very big but is a decent sized place that does not feel too cramped.

As there was only 30 minutes to closing we ordered a bunch of standard Thai dishes all at once like Crispy Fried Garlic prawns ($26.95), Pad se-ew ($9.95), Red Curry with shrimp ($13.95), Penang Curry with chicken (12.95), Combo fried rice ($11.95), Crab fried rice ($13.95) and Khoa Soi (10.95). Food was out in another 10 minutes so apart from the long wait to get a table service is pretty fast. I approached the food with a lot of skepticism as I've been burned too many times by these super hyped up places but after the first couple of bites it was clear that Lotus of Siam was legit and completely deserving of its high rating. The crispy fried garlic prawns were amazing, lightly battered, perfectly fried with a balanced taste that did not overpower the delicate crustacean. The pad se-ew was perfectly cooked noodles with just a mild sweet tang. Literally one of the best that I've had. The crab fried rice was another gem. Perfect taste without even a hint of the smell of crab. The Penang curry was also great. The noodles in the Khoa Soi were a little overcooked and hence were clumped together while the curry base was a little too watery so I thought that the dish did not come together very well. Taste-wise I thought that it had a good balance of sweet and spice, but most people in our group felt that it was too spicy for them. The red curry was not bad, just that it tasted very similar to the Penang curry. 

I felt that prices at Lotus of Siam were less than what you would pay at other similar Thai places but when compared with the inflated prices on the strip they seemed out-rightly cheap. Considering the overall package of service, cost and quality the only drawback that I can think about is the long wait to get a table. I'm almost tempted to deduct a star for just that, as it could seriously keep me from returning, but I'm going to overlook it and give them the rating that they deserve."}
{"text":"I've heard that this is one of the most amazing Thai restaurants to ever exist, but I don't think I'm enough of a Thai connoisseur to support that claim. The food was very good, but I didn't walk out of there feeling blown away.

We shared a rice dish (nam kao tod) which I loved. Have not had anything like that before. A little tangy, little spicy. Maybe it was my own fault for ordering musman curry (too pedestrian?) but I've had better. It was good, but too sweet. My fiancé ordered a noodle dish which was too spicy for me so I can't really rate that.

I don't think I would personally go out of my way to go to LOS, but I would go if someone else wanted to."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this local gem a million times & it is great each visit. The restaurant is pretty & service is always great. The location is a little sketchy in a strip mall but the food speaks for itself. Must visit if you love good thai food.
The soups are all good as well. The service has always been good, and attentive. Overall, Lotus Of Siam is among the better restaurants in Vegas, for quality of taste.. And, it's probably the best thai in the city as well. But, I must be honest. I've had better Thai in other places. So, to call this the best thai in the country is a bit of a stretch IMHO. But, many would argue, so I suggest to stop in and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas and fail to visit Lotus of Siam, you're really missing out, unless you're not a fan of amazingly delicious Thai food, that is. There is usually a wait, the atmosphere is classic Vegas strip mall, and the service is not the most friendly, but nothing could dissuade me from going because the food is so good. Come with a group so you can try a bunch of different things, otherwise your head will explode trying to make up your mind. Must try if it's your fist time - the NAM KAO TOD - \"Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice.\""}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after hearing about it from friends and reading the reviews on Yelp. I came here with family and snagged dinner reservations at 5:30. We were 5 minutes early and already there was a line forming at the door. They accommodated reservations first.

We ordered a few Thai iced teas, egg rolls and skewers to start off our meal. Nothing special about these.. but maybe the entrees would be better. 

A Fried rice, Panang Curry with Duck, Green Curry, and Beef Kha Soi later we were still unsatisfied, getting full - but the kind where the food hasn't hit the spot just yet. The flames flickering from the hot pot at the next table compelled us to try 1 more dish in hopes of satisfying our Thai craving.

15 minutes later and we were wishing we hadn't gone 20min off the strip. Yelp lost some believers that day. 

For dessert we ordered the fried bananas and mangos with sticky rice. Sticky rice had an after taste of some kind of tea. Dessert was good.

The Kha Soi was definitely the best thing on the table, the rest was mediocre. If you don't have Thai food in your hometown, by all means go try Lotus of Siam. But for others who are already familiar with Thai - save your Uber Fare for the slot machines."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, originally for the lunch buffet and now for the occasional dinner. It's a little pricey and always packed in the evenings, and for good reason. This food is top notch, better than Komol or any other Thai restaurant I've been to in town. It's an an unassuming, unimpressive, and perhaps uninviting strip mall, but this area's always been home to a mix of dives and delights, don't judge the book by it's cover or the guy hitting you up for money in the parking lot.

Once inside, you'll see the space is kept up well and has a substantial wine collection. I can't comment on that since I've always thrown all my money into food and sometimes a thai tea. Their signature cuisine is northern Thai, and while I don't have other cuisine from that region to compare it to, it is delicious. That said, so are the more traditional dishes. The orange chicken, which was good during the lunch buffet, is outstanding when made to order. The pineapple fried rice has a great depth of flavor and is well-seasoned. Anything with crispy duck is excellent. The last time we had a northern Thai shrimp curry that was top notch. If you're not picky, just give the server some general parameters and they'll take care of it for you. You want a curry, pineapple rice, and crispy duck dish? Say no more. I haven't had something for dinner yet that I felt was \"meh.\" The only problem, if you can call it that, is that the menu is huge which can make it tough to decide but on the other hand always provides some room to explore. 

This is a Vegas must. Call ahead to find out the wait time and see if you can put your name on the list. Expect a 45 minute wait for take-out. Don't think you can waltz in for dinner, any day of the week, without a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had! There were so many dishes to choose from that I actually forgot what we ordered. But I remember that the portions were smaller and on the pricey side. But then again, I didn't feel like I was pigging out even though we ordered a lot of dishes. 

If you're in VEGAS with your friends, I highly recommend checking it out! As far as the price, I would rather eat here than shell out $$$ at any of the Asian fusion [insert a chef's famous name here] on the strip."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal! Order from the last pages of the menu and you're in for a wonderful culinary experience! Try the larb, khai soi, drunken noodle with prawns and whole deep fried catfish. Very authentic dishes!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious thai food now at a closer location. Must order the garlic prawns. Their spice is no joke so order cautiously. We ordered the Tom yum seafood soup and basil beef dish as well. Great service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A little upscale version of a Thai restaurant. Get here early because the wait can be long. We arrived an hour and a half after they opened for dinner and the wait was an hour. Not too bad but feels like forever when you are hungry. If you can find a seat at the bar, you don't have to wait. Servers will refill your water with your water jug every time it goes halfway empty. Workers here are very sweet and this place has a relaxing atmosphere! I heard their garlic shrimp is a must have so that is what I ordered, along with the drunken noodles. 

Drunken noodles (4/5): very flavorful and good amount of seafood, but the taste is very generic. You can get this anywhere. 
Garlic shrimp (4/5): so I expected this dish to be super garlicky, but the day I got it, it didn't taste much like garlic. My friend said they have moved locations, so perhaps they are still learning how to perfect the dish again. Huge portions of shrimps!! $30 sounds a little on the steep side but it's worth a try. Plus, rice is free along with it. 

Overall, a good experience when in Vegas."}
{"text":"You've gotta love Thai food and culture for its sensuality.  Who else names their cities Bangkok and Phuket? So when I came across Lotus of Siam, I naturally thought it was a massage parlor with happy endings. After all, the lotus is the universal Asian code word for vajajay. I quote from an ancient Thai love poem - \"She laid back with her beauty spread before me like a lotus blossoming, ready to capture the dew\". Who woulda thought that Thai poets wrote in English back then!  But after reading the reviews I was aroused in a different way.( Now the term sexual appetite makes sense) and I had to go (or come, depending on your perspective).

So far of all the Thai places that I have been to, Lotus of Siam has had the best food of all.  I was pretty amazed at the wine selection available for a Thai restaurant.  Who thinks about varietals from Chateauneuf du Paupe in a Thai place?  But they have it here!  Service was unusually good for an Asian place.

Tom Yum Kai and Tom kha kai was the best I ever had anywhere.  Nice acidity and creaminess of coconut was spot on.  Braised short rib with panaang was ultra tender and wonderfully flavored.  A fantastic idea for that curry.  Fried sea bass on top drunken noodles was also very good.  very tender with a nice crisp saltiness.  I'm not sure if my taste buds were a bit off that day, but the food seemed a bit on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so.  Spice levels tend to be on the higher end, so I would order a notch or two down from what you normally get at other Thai places.

Gourmet magazine (before its closure) touted this as the best Thai food in America -  a pretty bold claim, but I can't find reason to argue.

If you can't get your spice on here, there is always the Green Door just across, so you can get your kinky on (or so I've heard).

I end with a famous Thai adage - Beware of who you lay with because you may be struck with the fiery burn of Thai chili in your head that has no mouth.

best thing - tom kha kai and braised short rib with panang"}
{"text":"Probably the best Northern Thai food you'll ever have outside of Thailand. We always get the garlic prawns that are crispy like potato chips and seasoned to garlicky perfection. Crab fried rice Paris well with those garlic prawns. Curries are also good, but beware the difference in spiciness: mild is medium, medium is hot, and hot is nuclear! Our last dish is the sweet, sour, spicy deep fried whole catfish. This is big enough for 4 to share! Definitely make reservations ahead of time to avoid the 1-2 hour wait for dinner. Once you're seated, they're quick and friendly. A one of a kind food experience that you MUST NOT MISS when you go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little secret Thai restaurant in town. It's frequented by local and visiting celebrities. Also helps that it was also featured in February 2011 Travel & Leisure magazine as one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Warning:  This place will post your messages publicly and with your check without talking to you about it!  Super unprofessional and unethical. Stay classy lotus, we left a 17% tip(food+drinks) even after our poor service btw.  I guess that is a good reason to share the tab online.

I updated a FB review from 5 years ago after having a poor night at the new location.  Lotus decided to share my post online and then called me a \"fake customer\".  Here is what happened.  I was told there was an hour wait for a table of 4 when we showed up @5:30pm, after 75min I asked how much longer and was told 30min.  After 45 more min (120min total) I asked how much longer was was told 45more min.  This was the time I send the first message.

I just needed you to be honest.  If it was a 3hr wait at the start then tell me.  If was an hour more after going over your estimated, then tell me.  Don't tell me 30min more when it is really and 75min more.   My poor review was based on being lied to.  There is a big difference between a 1hr wait and a 3hr wait.  We would of ate in the lounge area when offered but you said we would have a table in 30min so we waited.  If you told us it was going to be another hour we would of ate there   You were wrong, don't blast me online for your inability to keep track of your table turnover rate.

We showed up @ 5:30pm and YOU show that we were sat @ 7:52pm.  Add 30min for getting our food and boom.  3hr wait!  Not a fake review, just a bad experience.

{"text":"My friend who lives in vegas warned me that the prices were steep and the portions are small. And he was right. Everything that was on the menu was at least 2 to 7 dollars too expensive. I ordered the thai fried rice with pork and the nam prik ong (best thing I ever ate-food network). The thai fried rice was not only small, but also generic. The saving grace was the nam prik ong. Other than that, most of the menu items can be found at sanamluang in Hollywood, California (thai town). Sanamluang not only tastes better than Lotus of Siam, but also costs less and offers more portions. To be frank, I was tempted in giving this place a 2 star review. The nam prik ong was delicious, but wasn't worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The small serving of nam prik ong showed me that this place was nothing but a scam on people who can't get good thai food in Las Vegas. Alas, the nam prik ong did taste good, so I must give this place one star above two. Overall, I regret spending $20 something dollars here."}
{"text":"As usual the best rated restaurants don't live up to it's rank. It was ok, nothing to die for. The garlic shrimp with shell on was certainly very shelly. Was wondering if someone might choke on it and die. 

The coconut soup had chicken so over cooked and dry, where was the art of cooking?

I was expecting exceptional, turns out to be slightly above average. The portions are smaller and the prices are over double the average. This is for a restaurant located in a dumpy old mall."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Lotos of Siam. Made my reservations and was so looking forward to dinner because of all the great reviews on yelp. We drove up and saw a crowd in the front. Walked into the restaurant and saw nothing, but people waiting to be seated so I thought to myself that this thai place is great. But oh boy, what a BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! There was nothing great about their thai food. These people that rave about this place must have not had good thai food. Also, quite honestly the reviews are coming from non-asian people. C'mon now, the food was mediocre and the proportion was only enough for 1 person; my 2 year old niece ate the curry dish all by herself. It was edible, but nothing out of this world like everyone else is talking about.  The only highlight of the evening was the bottle of wine we ordered. For all you thai fans, the next time you're in CA, go to this hole in the wall joint called \"Thai Pepper\" in Huntington Beach.  Two 70 year old ladies are busting out authentic thai dishes."}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday lunch by a friend on 9/21/11. After reading the rave reviews of this place, I was expecting much more. 

We went at noon for the lunch buffet. I had no idea that this place was smack dab in the middle of the ghetto. It is in a run down (understatement) strip mall and the inside isn't much better. We were seated in the room with the basement windows. 

The buffet was the smallest I've ever seen - there were two chicken options, two soups, 2 noodle dishes and some vegetarian options. I tried a little bit of everything, but the only thing that stood out was the noodle soup. The orange chicken had an overpowering fake orange flavor and the pad thai was not good, nor were the egg rolls. That's too bad. 

My friend ordered the drunken noodles, and they were good. Maybe ordering from their entree menu would have been a better decision? We split a bowl of coconut ice cream and I grabbed a few deep fried bananas off of the bar - the ice cream was super delicious, but the bananas were just okay.

The service wasn't that great. We had empty cups almost the entire meal (until it was time for the check, then we were given a refill.)

I wasn't impressed and I'll probably just stick to eating in China Town."}
{"text":"Where can I start. DO NOT LEAVE VEGAS without trying this place.  One of the best authentic Thai restaurant in the US. Location is not the greatest but the food is unbelievable but you have to be ready to wait for awhile. What to order: KHAO SOI, Garlic Prawns, Beef panang, plat fool kra-prow krob, pad thai, pad se-ew and crispy duck with panang. I'll guarantee you'll be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the top recommended items based off yelp reviews. 

Crispy rice, nam kao tod: Was not the best. 
The crispy rice was interesting to say the least but the flavors were too strong. Too sour and too salty! 
Duck pennang: the best thing ever! This is a must get item. It was savoury and creamy and oh so delicious! We devoured this 
Garlic prawns: also very delicious. Fried with the shrimp shells. Not super duper garlicy. 
Soft shelled crab noodles: the soft shelled crabs were pretty good too but very small quantity for the price. 

The service was also phenomenal! The waiter was quick to come by and checked on is fairly frequently. The food also arrived quickly."}
{"text":"Huge menu, if you are first time and don't have preferences over Thai food, almost impossible to choose something. After nearly 20 min studying the menu, I ended up with extremely salty fish over raw cabbage.!No taste, no volume (4 peaces of fish for 17$), no satisfaction.
My husband ordered carry and was very happy with his order, I wanted to try smth new and picked the wrong item. So my personal experience food- 2, place 4, rating overall 3 stars.
Again my husband said that the food was outstanding (he is vegetarian)."}
{"text":"After all the gorging I did on my birthday weekend, I'm glad I went out with a bang at Lotus of Siam. This is my go-to spot for authentic Thai food and I am utterly in love. I've yet to find any restaurant that comes close to serving up dishes quite as tasty as theirs. The trick is to make good menu choices and you will be rewarded.

I got my usual Drunken Noodles with Prawns & Nam Kao Tod but this time switched it up a bit at the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers. Thank you my loves! The Crispy Panang Duck...WOW. An explosion of flavors that complimented our other dishes perfectly. It was divine as was everything else. Service was flawless as usual.

Tip: Don't make a reservation if you want to come in for an early dinner. Show up about 10-15minutes before they open (or earlier if you can stand the heat) and get seated right away. Works every time for us."}
{"text":"As a Thai girl who has eaten my share of Thai food, I have to say this place has the best spicy catfish with curry EVER. Pad kee map (drunken noodles) and red curry were good too. Definitely on the required pit stops in Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends while in Vegas. Chef Jet Tila made us a reservation, which he offered to do when I took his Thai town tour in LA, so I knew that it would be good! There were 5 of us and we ordered family style, starting with the summer spring roll special and papaya salad. I am a spicy girl, and those spring rolls were spicy! The papaya salad had perfect flavor, but it was a bit watery for my taste. For mains, we shared fried rice, panang curry with chicken, khao soi with shrimp (my favorite) and barbecued pork. I can't get enough noodles right now and the noodles in the khao soi were perfect! The flavors were perfect in everything and I absolutely loved it! Also, at $140 for the whole meal, what a slamming deal for Vegas!"}
{"text":"On our flight to vegas, we ran into a top chef contestant, Marcel. We asked him where to eat in Vegas and this was one of his choices.  \"Best Thai Food in North America\" by Gourmet magazine, so I had some high expectations. Having been to Thailand and hung out with locals who showed me delicious non-touristy food, I was super excited to try this place. 

The food was good and spicy! I LOVE spicy food and most thai restaurants are just not spicy enough for me, so 4 stars for that! But I think calling it the best thai food in the USA is probably an exaggeration. Though, perhaps if I had tried more dishes, I would think so. I asked the waitress for her recommendations and she was quick to point out dishes that weren't on the menu and were 2x as expensive. That was a bit suspicious, so we just stuck to dishes from the menu that sounded good.

Would go back to try more."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me whenever I am in Las Vegas.  The food is out of this world delicious.  The wine selection is fantastic as well. 

My favorite is the panang curry with shrimp served over white rice.  The pad Thai is the best I've had in the United States or Europe.  The coconut curry soup is also fantastic and a great way to start dinner.  We tried the Thai spaghetti this time around and it was very tasty and delicious.  

Aside from having won a ridiculous amount of awards,  the restaurant has also picked up a few James Beards which says a great deal about this place.  I will continue to come back to this place and recommend it to anyone that is in Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Don't judge Lotus by the gritty shopping plaza it's located in. This is the best Thai Food I have had in ages. I've lived in Vegas for 6 years and am truly upset that I have denied myself of this gem for so long. The biggest problem I had was trying to decide what to order. 
Nam Prik Ong was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I only went there because it was on one of Anthony Bourdain's episodes. The food didn't really taste much different from most Thai restaurants I've been to, but it was very overpriced. After ordering the fried red snapper which was on the menu for $40, the waiter came back to our table 10 minutes later, and said that they could only prepare the snapper for us for $50 because it was the only one left and it was really big (he made a gesture with his hands that seemed to suggest that the fish was about 2 feet long). So I said okay, $50 was fine, just because we were on our honeymoon and we wanted to treat ourselves - we also didn't want to delay our food since we had already waited 10 minutes. So the guy went back to the kitchen, and about 20 minutes later, emerged with the illustrious snapper. I kid you not, the fish was nowhere close to the 2 feet gesture he had made with his hands. It was a small fish, not even a foot long - I would say at most, it was only 5 inches long, excluding the tail which you can't eat anyway. To make things worse, there was nothing special about the way the fish tasted; it was simply dipped into the frier and pulled out just like any other restaurant does it - the only thing that added a unique  flavor to it was the small sweet red sauce it came with on the side (I guess this is what we were paying $50 for? Lol).

 As we started eating the fish, we  realized how much we had been up-sold and ripped off - we essentially paid $50 for a small fish that would have otherwise  been worth about  $14  anywhere else. So in total, we ended up paying over $92 for 2 very small dishes, and an appetizer  (the fried chicken dumpling). 

One of the dishes was from the chef's special menu, and it was the khaoi saoi crispy duck curry (again, it had very little duck in it, and we paid almost $30 for it). 

If you're in Vegas and you are really craving Thai Food and you want to try this place out, my advise would be to stick to the items on the Northern menu, and make sure to go only for items that are around $10 (there's no difference in the size of the portions; $10 items, and $30 items, are all the same size - the only difference is in the types of spices they use - so if you are all about trying different flavors and not necessarily getting more bang for your buck portion-wise, then by all means go ahead and pay $30 for a $10 size dish).

And oh, STAY AWAY FROM THE FISH - it's an absolute rip off! Lol"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional I only went in for take out however it's overpriced for what you get but I think that's because of the rent they must pay for the large building and location. 
Will absolutely go back there to dine in sometime."}
{"text":"This place looks a bit sketchy from the outside and is slightly tricky to find, but keep looking and don't let the outside appearance scare you.  Once you start chowing you will be hooked.  I can't wait to go back.

I told the waiter what I was interested in and he guided me to select something off the menu and it was awesome and spicy.  It was on a bed of cabbage with boiled sea bass and the spicy sauce from one of the salmon dishes.  I had it for an entree but would have preferred to share as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Went there with colleague ... and we loved it! But, we did have to wait 45 minutes on a Thursday night ... reservations are definitely an advantage and highly recommended (along with the WIG SHOP next door)! 

Highlights were ... First and foremost ... definitely the FABULOUS wine list (if you like Riesling, you'll LOVE this selection ... and WHAT would better calm your fiery taste buds after some chili paste???) ... the Tom Yum Kai soup is delish (but you'd better enjoy some spicy, tingling lips afterward)... and the sea bass special that was sprinkled with fresh basil, mint and chili oil. OMFG ... YUM! The NUA DAD DEAW ( Beef jerky Issan style) ap had great flavor ... but definitely traditional JERKY STYLE (dry and hard to chew). I've had better Thai-style jerky that was thicker, crispy on the outside, but very tender on the inside. The NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice) was very unique and I would highly recommend. 

This place is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for the adventurous.  I had been forewarned that the restaurant was in a kind of seamy strip mall, but was world class.

It lived up to its billing.  It specializes in a wide range of Thai food, particularly from the north.  We let the waiter suggest an appetizer.  It was so good, we decide to let them impress us with whatever they wanted to bring.

It was amazing, one of the best dining experiences that I have had in years."}
{"text":"This place had been an wonderful experience for me and my wife. We are thai food lovers and can be sometimes too critical about the food quality. They have one of the best foods we have ever tested and also a lot of variations."}
{"text":"Love the Northern Thailand pork dishes like pork stew and ground pork.  Curries, noodles and traditional dishes are well executed.  Worth a trip to the ghetto Commercial Center.  Coming  in between 1-2  is best to get in quickly.  Buffet is mediocre so go for the al a carte fare. The curry dishes, Thai style, is the best in town.
Expect a line on the weekends."}
{"text":"Deeply satisfying, rich, bright flavors, contrasted by that unforgettable, pallet-stimulating, fermented tinge of northern style chili dips... should you wish to indulge that is...

If you're in the mood for flavors not typical of a normal Thai restaurant experience I recommend one of the chili dips with a side of sticky rice to order alongside your typical Thai curry fare ; pungent, deep flavors reminiscent of korean pork marinated with fermented chili paste mix.

...very interesting that it's served with a side of sticky rice, somewhat less consumed in Southeast Asia but coincidently, a staple in east Asia: almost as if the pallet demands it to accompany it's instinctive, fermented counterpart...

To explore these things of course skip right to the back of the menu to the highly touted \"northern\" segment, or the chef's recommendations on the following page.  I personally recommend the crispy duck served with curry on atop a bed of noodles - heaven on a plate my friends.

This place is all substance, some hype yes.  But that actually make it even more impressive...a place living up to it's expectation, now that's a rarety. 

5 bright stars."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's a really good Thai restaurant, maybe the best I've ever had.  And I live in LA where there's a Thai Town.  That crying shrimp dish is really good.  Even though it's generic, but probably the best Pad Thai ever.  We ordered the drunken noodles off menu.  It wasn't that great, but I was already really full by then."}
{"text":"Hidden jem of Vegas! Recent discovery was the spicy chicken wings, oh my god they were amazing! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"My second favorite restaurant in Vegas besides Raku that i have to visit whenever i go to Vegas. The food is excellent and the wine selection is impressive. Save room for dessert: I definitely recommend sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream. They have the BEST coconut ice cream"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars for the food and 4/5 for service. 

From the Outside this place looks super ghetto, sketchy and dead. But inside is a nice casual ambience with two sides of a dining room. 

I definitely think this place is overhyped, although It is better than other Thai places in Vegas. We ordered a grip load of food between the 4 of us. 

Raw shrimp- 5/5. Best raw shrimp compared to my area in Orange County . The chili sauce and house made satay chili oil together was a mouth orgasm. Yum. 

Seafood Tom Yum- 3.5/5 I think I like my soup more with a spicier and tangy kick to it. This soup was just okay to me. 

Garlic Prawn Shrimp- 3.5/5 it's good, don't get me wrong. It's got a good taste and nice crisp to it. But it's nothing mind blowing because I've had something similar to it before. 

Spicy Spaghetti- 3.0/5 not what I imagined .. I thought it was going to have tomato/marinara sauce but it was some spicy chili sauce. 

Kao Soi- 4.5-5 crispy duck curry with egg noodle was great. The curry was too much coconut for my taste but that's only because I'm sensitive to coconut, otherwise this is a great noodle dish! 

Beef jerky- 4.5/5 such a random pick my friend ordered but it's a solid appetizer just to pick at. It's surprisingly good and addicting!

We had other items but not worth mentioning. Overall... I probably wouldn't make a visit if I was in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I have had the best authentic Thai food though so I tend to compare every Thai restaurant to that.. which may be unfair. I called ahead to get a reservation and was told they weren't doing reservations at the time. They let me know the wait would be an hour. My friend and I show up, the bar was packed, and we were told the wait would be an hour and a half and asked for our number in the event a table would open. We got a call 15 mins later. 

The place is busy and very loud. However, the service was excellent and the wait staff was very friendly and made great suggestions. 
The portions were sort of lunch sized portions in my opinion. I ordered curry and it came in a small serving bowl with another small dish that had about a half cup of rice (Im not exaggerating here). I mention the portion size because the food is served family style but there is not enough to share. The spice level here goes from 1 to 10. If you get papaya salad make sure you get a 2 or 3. The 4 would taste like a 10 lol.. 
For pad Thai or anything else you will need a spice tray if you aim lower than 5. Otherwise it was a good experience. I would return."}
{"text":"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I've been to this place twice on my annual business trips to Vegas, and it's A-MAZING. It's hidden in a sort of shady-looking plaza, but don't let that deter you! They have pictures of celebrities all over the wall, as well as awards and accolades for best food EVER. 

A large and varied menu, the food is darn good. Forgive me that I can't remember the names of everything, but I've had a Thai dish that was out of this world, as well as a really good appetizer that is pork stuffed into chicken. My colleagues loved their dishes (which was good, since I suggested the place), and the coconut ice cream is awesome. The staff is friendly, and it felt really good to sit down there and eat a great meal after a long day at a convention. If I ever make it out to Vegas again, this is my number one spot to hit!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving Thai food and I heard how good this place was we decided to go try it for dinner. We got there right when it opened and were immediately seated, but noticed it filled up really fast so I would recommend either making reservations or going early. It looks kind of ghetto from the outside, but the inside was nice. We ordered chicken pad thai, beef pad see ew, chicken panang curry, papaya salad and chicken satay. Everything was pretty good, but the portions were kind of small for the price (probably because I'm used to SoCal portions). At medium spicy, the papaya salad was pretty freaking spicy so I would recommend mild. 

Also when we were leaving we saw Zedd and his crew coming in so that was a fun plus! Hoping to try their specialty items next time I come."}
{"text":"Great restaurant where you least expect it.  When you want great food that's reasonably price and away from the craziness of the strip.  Service is great and great wine selection."}
{"text":"FINALLY got to check this place out!

Went with a group of 9 and so we got to try everything and everything was DELICIOUS!!!

We ordered the following:

Catfish w Thai Basil, Pad Thai w chicken, Padseew w Beef, Garlic Prawns, Crispy Mussel Omelet, Green Curry, Crispy Duck with Panang, Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. 

Everything was very good!!! But if  you must choose a few from the list above I would go with Garlic Prawns, Crispy Duck with Panang & Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. 

I would probably pass on the Pad Thai, Padseew & Green Curry next time. Pad Thai & Padseew was good but you could get just as good noodles elsewhere. Green Curry was kind of plain compared to the other dishes. If you want curry I would get the Crispy Duck w Panang over the green curry. 

TIPS: 
1) Make RSVP online on their website! So much better than trying to call to make RSVP! Lifesaver!!! :)
2) Plenty of parking so no worries if you decide to drive there! Probably better since it will be faster than trying to grab a taxi or uber/lyft etc."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out based on all the hype and yelp reviews. We went during lunch because it was a Friday and we didn't want to bother with the wait during dinner. The place is located in a dingy plaza however once you step inside you tend to forget the location. They have a huge glass wine cellar when you walk in and framed pictures hanging all over the walls of people who have eaten there. We were seated and serviced immediately, no wait. I asked the waiter what were popular dishes and he made recommendations,  mainly all under the \"Northern\" portion. I decided to order the Khao Soi with chicken and I'm glad I did. It was very delicious and had just the right spice to it. The chicken and noodles were cooked throughly and went perfect with the sauce. Only gripe is I wish it had more chicken and noodles because towards the end I had nothing but the sauce to eat however it was seasoned so good that I didn't mind slurping that alone. My friends ordered drunken noodles and thai tea and both of then said it was really good too. We ordered mango and sticky rice for dessert.  Although in our opinion it wasn't the best we had,  it was still good. As other reviews have mentioned, the portion size tends to be on the smaller side however we did not leave hungry either. We were still very satisfied and felt the price was quite reasonable for the quality.  This will definitely be a spot we hit up when we're in Vegas again. Next time I plan to order the crispy duck since it seems to be the most popular item to order."}
{"text":"Just went to Thailand for 2 weeks in October. Haven't be able to find authentic Thai food in the states until last night. Felt like we were back in Chiang Mai. 

Green curry level 10 was perfect. Tom Yum was incredible. Drunken noodles / soft shell crab is a must."}
{"text":"So after however long we've put off on coming here we finally trekked ($23 cab ride, one way) out to Lotus of Siam... for lunch mind you since the dinner wait was an hour wait. We had the crispy duck w/ greens, sea bass w/ drunken noodle, garlic shrimp, and mango & sticky rice. All which were extremely good I just couldn't get over the fact that those 4 dishes came out to be over $100 w/ tip. Not a big deal since we won enough money to pay for all 5 days meals & entertainment but DAMN! Was it worth it?? Yes but it definitely teetered near the edge of ridiculously overpriced, considering it wasn't on the strip in a fancy casino property (just carried the premium).

Well anyways, I'm glad we came since it was always on our \"to-eat-at\" list for Vegas. Maybe next time we'll try Kabol or Archies for Thai. I would come back to Lotus of Siam but probably with more people. Also, their wine list & glass enclosed racks were impressive. Something you'd rarely see in an Asian restaurant. I'd like to think my meal helped pay for that!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, accommodation and most of all they made it special by surprising my husband with a singing birthday greeting and ice cream! Awesome food! Highly recommend this place! Hands down!"}
{"text":"My wife and I flew down from Toronto for a 3 day getaway to Vegas. The day before we left I caught the Anthony Bourdain review on CNN for Lotus of Siam. We were impressed! Went for lunch at noon and walked by the buffet which was very busy but knew I was ordering off of the Northern Thai menu. We started with Tom Yum soup then ordered 3 dishes from the Northern Thai Pages at the end of their menu. Service was great, food arrived quickly and it was \" to die for\"
We will be back!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but I guess that's the point behind the phrase, \"hidden gem.\"  Really though, there is nothing hidden about it, since it's been reviewed countless times, 306 at the time of this writing.  Its also been featured in magazines, and for good reason.  I love this place.  I also have an infatuation with their fried prawns.  I always come as soon as they open.  That way I can be seated immediately.  I always leave room for dessert.  Can't go wrong with coconut ice cream, unless you hate coconut."}
{"text":"Finally, after years of living in Vegas, I finally had the best Thai spot in town (some say best in country), and it totally lived up to the hype. 

Saturday Night - take note of the hours before heading there. They open at 5:30pm and close at 10pm. But don't assume they won't get business for the few hours. Arrived at 5:20pm and there stood a 60+ person line outside while the parking lot was filling fast - and don't worry, there's a LOT of seating so you'll be seated quickly after opening. 

Inside looks like a big dining hall. One area has normal tables for small families while the other area  can probably accommodate for your party of 100. Also interesting and didn't find this out til later, they take reservations!

The staff works so well like an oiled machine. It's impressive how good they are in their knowledge of the menu and they're so polite too - especially when they're dealing with such large and loud groups. 

The food was delicious. As like many others, this cuisine was new to me and I didn't know what to order. But reading through probably 100s of items on the thick menu, I went with the infamous Garlic Prawns ($27.95), Panang Curry with beef ($11.95), and Khao Soi ($10.95) and it was all so good. Flavors from lime, coconut, egg and curry mixes are such a unique taste that I have to come back here for more."}
{"text":"Crispy duck panang is my favorite dish. The braised short rib is a close second. Anthony Bourdain got it right when he mentioned this place in not just 1 but 2 episodes. Just have to make sure to avoid the rush... this place is well known and very popular."}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews of this restaurant, and being a fellow Thai- I really wanted to try this place out. I finally made it out to Las Vegas with full excitement to try out dishes that will remind me of home. I ordered about 6 local dishes (sausages, papaya salad, sticky rice, khao soy, beef jerky, tiger steak) and to my surprise... I was SO DISAPPOINTED WITH EVERY DISH! The sticky rice was not fresh and was reheated in a plastic bag in a microwave!! The sausages were burnt. The papaya salad taste like something a foreigner made. Khao soy had no flavor. Tiger steak was over priced and hard to chew. 
What's with all the hype on this place? Celebrity endorsement? 
The best Thai places I've been to in Las Vegas is Krung or Two Sisters (but make sure the mom is cooking if you're going to hit up two sisters). 
This review is not base on their service. That's something else. This review is the quality of food... take your money and time elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here, in fact I was here twice in a 24 hour period. All the dishes were fantastic-and to think that Thai food couldn't get any better!Customer service can be a bit more accommodating but the food well makes up for it. The interior really didn't match with the exterior and that was a surprise (you'll know what I mean). My recommendations: Pad Thai, Garlic Fried Shrimp, and the Crispy duck in Panang curry! Everything was so incredibly flavorful and mouthwatering. Expect to spend at least $50 for a party of two! I'd prefer this over a typical Vegas buffet ANYDAY!"}
{"text":"Flavor, Flavor, Flavor!

Believe the reviews - it IS that awesome! 

Saw the place in one of the Antony Bourdain shows and decide to check it out.  The food is excellent!

Highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place needs another review but I do want to give props to the serving staff for being so accommodating for our group! Our group of 8 arrived to the restaurant by opening time at 5:30 PM and were nervous because we had to be done eating and paying by 6:30 PM in order to make it to our show back on the Strip at 7 PM. Our waiter was extremely accommodating and helpful in getting our order taken right away, and he was not kidding when he said the kitchen is fast. I think within 5 minutes of ordering, the food started to show up.

Our favorites were:
-Garlic Prawns: I don't even usually like eating shrimp but these were so sweet and juicy.
-Steamed Chilean Sea Bass: You really can't go wrong with Sea Bass
-Sticky Rice with Fried Banana and Coconut Ice Cream: I was surprised at how delicious the fried banana was! They cook it like an egg roll, and the banana inside was so good and not too sweet.

I do want to note that on my first visit, I felt very underwhelmed because of all the hype and reviews. After coming here on second visit, I have to say the food is extremely solid, fresh, good quality, and the standout dishes like garlic prawns make the off-strip trek worth it. Do stick with the restaurant recommendations/specials because some of the other dishes (tom yum soup, papaya salad) are standard and taste like you could get them from any other Thai restaurant in America."}
{"text":"After all these years in Vegas, how did I ever miss this place?!


We got there just in time .... just in time before the crazy rush and 2 hour wait. (Yah it gets pretty crazy). One minute, the tables are clean and the restauraunt is quiet .. the next minute, it is jammed pack

Our server was very attentive and you see him bounce around from table to table, taking orders, updating you on your order, and checking up on you. 

We ordered the tom yum soup (with chicken), rad na, and crispy duck over flat rice. Everything was amazingly delicious. I'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas.

Warning - I'm starting to think that WAITING is necessary in Vegas (regardless of going into XS or going into this resturaunt), but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"OH MY DEAR GOD, WHY HAVE I NEVER BEEN HERE?!

I have heard of Lotus of Siam in the past - initially on Top Chef Vegas and then on other reviews of James Beard award winners and other nerdy food lovers things. I decided I MUST try it, so I made a reservation on a Friday night right after we got to town. I was so pleased with this decision.

Lotus is in a strip mall off the strip so you will need a car, a taxi, or an Uber/Lyft to get here. Everything else around it looks a little industrial or sketch and maybe there was a naughty club nearby, but it doesn't matter, just go.

I made a reservation and they say they hold your reservation for precisely...3 minutes...so be on time. We got there right in time, but do allow for traffic when you are coming from the Strip.

I would recommend perusing the menu before you get here. I not only read the menu front to back online (there are a lot of options), I also read some articles about the best things to get here. Of course, when I got there I read the menu again. It is all so exciting, but apparently what they have that many other Thai places don't is Northern Thai cuisine and a killer riesling menu.

We started by ordering an off dry riesling since we aren't much into sweet wines but wanted to try one to complement our spicy dishes. We got a bottle and were not disappointing. Apparently they have one of the best riesling menus of anywhere around and they really do go well with Thai food. Try some!

As for the food, I went with the waiter's recommendation of Nam Kao Tod. That's crispy rice with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, onions, ground dry chiles, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. I have never had anything like this. We went with 5 out of 10 on spice level to see what we were working with here and it was pretty spicy and it was fucking delicious. The crispy rice was a new one on me, it was like each individual piece of rice had been fried in spices and was individually crunchy and flavorful. I mean, it was a home run.

For entrees, we went Northern Thai to see what that was all about. I got Kang Ka Noon which is spicy young jack fruit curry. I mainly got this because I've never had jack fruit and I wanted that. I got it with pork, 5 out of 10 on spice. The curry was not thick, almost more like a stew. Jack fruit has an artichoke-like consistency so if you don't like that, you may not like this. Again, I have never had anything like this and we enjoyed it. The BF ordered the Sai Oua which is Northern style pork sausage. It was ground pork with herbs and spices and come pretty much medium spiced. It was sliced on the plate. I don't even know what is going on with this sausage, but we were in LOVE with it. What is that spice in there? We spent a lot of time trying to place it...anise? Nutmeg? Other? Just get this, it is soooooo goooood. We had all this with some sticky rice (and the curry also came with rice so that was a DOH on our part...).

I must mention that this place is deceptively enormous inside and can seat a lot of people, but there are a lot of people there so be prepared to wait if you have no reservations. HOWEVER, despite the crush of people there, the waitstaff are really on point. They have bluetooth earpieces and talk to each other and everything just flows. Really a good setup.

I was DELIGHTED, ECSTATIC, OVERWHELMED WITH JOY about Lotus of Siam. I WILL be back on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Server made thoughtful recommendations with what I actually wanted in mind. I'm not local, I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas! Don't let the rundown look of the outside turn you away. Lotus is the real deal."}
{"text":"10 entree's and everything was great. My favorites were the sea bass and the BBQ shrimp, specifically 101 B. Make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place gets such high ratings. We stopped by to have dinner before a show. It wasn't packed, but was busy. We ordered our meal. The food arrived and the rice noodles were all clumped together on my plate and I had to cut them into chunks to eat it. It was just weird. Weird and not good. I haven't been back and won't be back...especially when there are so many lovely little family run Thai places that are so much better. Disappointing after all they hype."}
{"text":"Simply, the best thai food i've ever had in my life. Everything was outstanding!!!! I would love to go back when i visit las vegas."}
{"text":"Solid food but a bit pricey.

A Thai restaurant which is pretty close to Stratosphere.  The inside is very large. There are pictures hanging on the wall w/ celebrities such as Nicholas Cage, etc.  The bathrooms and inside are pretty clean.

The food is pretty solid.  Most dishes run at about $12-$15 each plate so it's much more expensive compared to LA prices.  I also prefer some of the Thai restaurants in LA but the food is still pretty good here.

Stuff that's really good - 4/5
-Pad Thai - Pad Thai is solid.  It's not over the top sweet (I don't like super sweet Pad Thai).  Probably the second best Pad Thai I've had.
-Spicy Catfish Fillet (No bone) - I usually prefer the catfish w/ bone-in, but this was a fillet.  It was surprisingly really good.  Nice crunchy texture and sauce was good.

Slightly above average - 3.5/5
-Pad See Ew - Enjoyable.  It wasn't out of this world awesome but it's good.
-Panang Curry - Solid.  Beware, it's got a lot of coconut milk so in it, so I wouldn't recommend eating this before something sexy/romantic like clubbing - lol.
-Tom Yum Seafood soup - Enjoyable.

Average - 3/5 - All of this stuff was decent, but you can opt to pass on it if you fancy.
-Rad Na - Decent, but nothing special.
-Spicy Beef Noodle soup - In general, this is one of my favorite dishes to order at a Thai restaurant.  Unfortunately  this wasn't anything special (I didn't see any liver in it and I felt the soup base was a bit bland) 
-Skewers - Decent, but nothing special.  The peanut sauce was really good though.
-Spicy Sausage - Decent, but nothing special.

Bad - 2/5 - 
-Crispy fried rice appetizer.  It's like I was eating Mexican fried rice due to the red onions and overloaded green onions/cilantro.  I'm used to eating crispy fried rice but this tasted odd.

TIPS:
-Reservation necessary"}
{"text":"Look,

I couldn't tell you what our party of 8 ordered, per the menu, but I can tell you what we ate. The wantons, the sea bass (which seems to be a perpetual special). We were directed to a tasting menu, with some dishes served ala carte to our respective setting,  and some served family style. Everything was a taste amusement park, from the spicy to the sweet, every note was played out over the course of the meal. Sensational when you sit down expecting a quartet and a symphony shows up. There's no need to do a ton of research here, if you're an expert of this region of Thailand's cuisine,  you'll know what to try. If you're a novice, I mean even a COMPLETE novice, have no fear the excellent staff reads the customer well. It's pretty tough to be disjointed, everything is just in a very base way, delectable. 

The restaurant has updated its look smartly since I first tried it during the \"I just discovered this amazing place\" days. 

Special.

Get a reservation well in advance, this is one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here yesterday. We had a party of 9 total and my Thai friend was doing the ordering and interaction with our waiter. We just simply picked dishes and did it family-style. We tried a bunch of things and I wouldn't say I dislike any of them, but I especially loved the Crispy Duck and the Mango on the mango sticky rice. I actually really like sticky rice, but I didn't like the sticky rice here.

The portions are small, but the prices are a bit higher up. The quality is good though so I guess you can say it offsets it. If you want to eat a lot and cheap, this wouldn't be the place for you. Go another day.

Having said all that, I'd come back here when I wanted Thai food as this place is really good and it was really packed. The area it's in would NOT be somewhere I'd normally go to and the place is a lot bigger than you think it is (looks small outside and it's a hole in the wall kind of place).

Since I didn't do the ordering we had a bunch of other dishes that my friends liked, but I wouldn't know the name. I just particularly liked the crispy duck that night, hehe :0D.

OH! Also. Service was great. Although I did not interact with any of the servers and our waiter, they were great at refilling waters and when we asked for more rice, they got it pretty quickly. A!! And we also didn't get charged 18% gratuity for having a party over 6 (maybe they forgot or they were being nice cause of my friend). But we tipped 18%."}
{"text":"I really hate that  I have to  give this place such a low rating.  We went here  with some friends who  were visiting on 8/17/17. I made a reservation in  advance a few weeks for 7pm and when we got there they  pulled it up  and we were seated right away.  The menu is very  expansive, so there are a lot of dishes to  choose from, but it was kind of a pricey  place.  There was this curry  dish I wanted to  try  out, but it was $30 and the portions (from looking around) weren't that large. I couldn't justify spending the $30 for non seafood curry. To start we ordered potstickers and salt and pepper wings. They were just ok I guess. The wings were kind of devoid of flavor unfortunately. When I  order this at Chinese places they smack you in the face and are full of flavor, but these  were kind of bland. For dinner, I ordered chicken  massamun curry and my friend i was sharing with ordered chicken pad thai.  The curry was goog, but the thing is with all these amazing reviews  i expected more . Also every dish was a small portion. The guys in our group  were still hungry after eating their noodle dishes.  When it came time to  pay the server was no where to be found. A large party  had come in  of about 15 and he catered to them , but never came to  give us our check, I kid you not we waited like 40 minutes just to pay and leave. It was kind of ridiculous. Overall,  the food was decent, but  there are definitely way better local Thai spots out there that are reasonably priced and with  food that  is soo full of flavor, e.g. Dave Wongs Pan Asian (spring valley), Gata Thai (henderson), and Le Thai (downtown). 


Stars taken away because of the service at the end of our meal, the portion size of the dishes comapred to  the price, and the appetizers not really being that  great."}
{"text":"The Original Lotus of Siam is on Sahara.  Apparently a roof collapse in 11/2017 had them looking for a temporary location, and here we are! Hopefully this becomes a permanent location so people can get their Thai food!  We just can't get enough of this place!

This one on Flamingo Rd is a little closer to the strip, a little smaller, but a lot more modern.  We went 12/2017, a few weeks after their grand opening, they didn't even have their liquor license yet. The presentations were more modern and clean, but the homemade taste remained the same--spectacular!  We had curry, drunken crab noodles, seabass, garlic prawns.  These were all delicious just like the original Lotus of Siam. Hopefully the original location will be up and running again soon--double the chance to enjoy their tasty Thai cuisine!  Winning in Vegas!"}

{"text":"Pretty much the best Thai food in the US. Definitely go for their Northern dishes, including stuff from both the Mae Hong and Isaan regions. I never leave here dissatisfied, and the only problem is that it's so tasty that you have to book well in advance, so be forewarned!"}
{"text":"YES!

finally - good food in las vegas!  it seems fitting that you need to take a cab to a random-seeming strip mall to get some good food that won't cost you 100's of $$$.  this place is authentic thai food, which i really appreciated bc i hadn't experienced any authenticity the entire 2 days i'd been in vegas.  
i dragged my brother away from the casinos on the strip to come here, he was annoyed that we had to wait an hour for a table, but once we were seated and he saw the wine selection he started to come around. the service was really fast, and the dishes were delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant we've ever been to. We've tried many items from the menu and they have all been delicious. I'm always thinking of our next visit! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"It looks like a 'hole in the wall' place, but it was amazing! The atmosphere inside was beautiful and intimate. If you're Gluten Free, this is a great restaurant for you! The staff was patient and knowledgeable about allergies, and they made sure that what I ordered was Gluten Free. The Masaman Curry was delicious and the waiter was excellent! Lotus of Siam is a MUST if you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"was in vegas on business and every night someone different from the show was recommending this place. so finally i went and DAMN amazing thai food. comparing to my favorite places back home in hawaii this one blows it out the water. next time i'm in vegas i will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So I was really looking first to trying this place because I've heard they have the best Thai food
In America and my first visit there was not a let down. We tried a few different dishes and everything was spectacular.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you...the interior is beautiful and the food is great. Stopped in for lunch...could have gone back for dinner. They have a huge menu, great drink options and great service."}
{"text":"This is by FARRRRRR the best Thai restaurant you will ever eat at definitely in Las Vegas but probably in the United States. All I have to say is you have to get something from the Northern Specialties. I got the beef stew with the sticky rice and it was absolutely phenomenal! They have one of the most amazing selections of wine and they even have a few amazing beers like Firestone Union Jack. You have to get a reservation way in advance but trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Best savory flavor and they actually have Kai Kooah"}
{"text":"Highly recommend getting there before they open at 5:30pm. We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.  

The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient. 

The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck. 

The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?"}
{"text":"Eh, service was great. our waiter was fast and attentive. I wasn't too impressed with the food after all.. 

If you are tourist here in Vegas wanted to tried the most popular Thai food. here is the place for you. Want real home cook style Thai food? I will go to Komol, and yes I speaking from my personal experiences!"}
{"text":"Definitely good Thai food.  Their prices are on the high side considering the 3rd world setting of their location.  Have been here numerous times - and the food is always extremely tasty and spiced to perfection although portions are on the small side.  This restaurant reeks of pine-sol/lysol that they use on the table.  The smell gave everyone a headache.  They should definitely air out this place a bit.

Very sketchy location: inside a run down strip mall with swingers clubs, massage parlors, and who knows what else.  In fact last time we pulled up in front of the restaurant and saw the guy in the car next to us get fellatio from an oriental lady.  Gross.  I don't mind restaurants in low rent areas but this place takes the cake.  I can't really bring out of town guests here anymore with all the strange activities going on around the restaurant in this bizarre, depressing area.  

The male waiters are extremely friendly and helpful but the ladies at the front are total bi***es."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their deep fried garlic pawns! The Tom yum soup is very different than what I had before but still tastes amazing! The service is very nice. Very professional environment. Their mango sticky rice is ok, the mango was sour, maybe it'd taste better if the mango were to be sweet! The crispy duck and deep fried red snapper are all good. Papaya salad is great if you're into that type of salad. Satay was well marinated and tender. Overall great experience! Also this place is all booked up 3 weeks in advance but the wait is not too bad 20 mins for lunch, 45 mins for dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Thai food. Trust me - I don't give many five star reviews and lotus deserves every single one of them. Haven't found a better Thai place in NY, Boston, or San Francisco (and it's not even close). 

I've had the garlic prawns (dreamy dish, HUGE shrimp, crispy shell), tom yum (deep, sour lemongrassy flavor), crispy duck penang (awesome though small for what you pay - maybe 8 strips of fried duck with sauce for over $20. devoured it), soft shell crab drunken noodle (really good), sea bass noodle (absurdly delicious), and more. I hear the dessert is really good too. 

Don't miss out on this place. Also, if you don't enjoy heat ask for level 2 (of 10). Don't go above 3 unless you want a hot dish. 6+ will knock your socks (and palate) off."}
{"text":"Been going here for several years now and this place never gets old.  Although the wait time, can be long, but all worth it!  

I always order Level 10 Thai spice Panang Curry Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns, Crying Tiger Level 10, Diet Coke and the sticky rice, with mango and ice cream!  

This past weekend we dined here * THREE * nights in a row for dinner !!!!  Food is always on point and always hits the spot!  Staff are all friendly.   My only go to spot if you are looking for some of the best authentic Thai Dishes! 

I wish this place is open for lunch on weekends!  Lunch is only available on weekdays, other than that, this place is amazing!  

Next few times I dine here, I plan to up my spice level to 20, then 30 then 50!"}
{"text":"We heard that it gets crowded on the weekends.  So, we went for lunch on a Friday.  Got there at 11:40.  Got seated right away.  Thank goodness we arrived early.  It was packed by the time we left.  We had the Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip).  It was ok.  More of a appetizer with veggies to dip.  The Garlic Prawns were light, crispy and full of flavor.  We definitely order that again.  The Crispy Duck Panage was also good.  We wished it had more curry sauce.  Overall, it was a great meal.  Skip the buffet and order off the menu."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  I have been to a number of Thai locations in LV and this one tops the charts.  I also got to try some of their food at a Taste of LV event and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best thai restaurants in Vegas I've been here twice and both times I left very full and satisfied. The service lacks alittle but the food is well worth waiting for. 

Papaya salad_ really spicy but addicting

Angel wings_ so crispy and good we ordered 2

Fried catfish_we weren't aware how big it would be but we killed it among 5 people

Yellow curry_flavorful and had a nice kick. We got spicy level 7

Pad Thai_ can't really go wrong with this dish.

Fried prawns_ crispy and they also fry the heads so they are like chips

Sweet and sour chicken_ I think this was my least favorite. Nothing to special

Mango sticky rice_ great way to put you in a food coma

Definitely would come back here when I'm in town"}
{"text":"O-M-G just had Lotus of Siam Saturday night and it was amazing. First let me say if you are Ubering/Lifting from the Strip, be sure to tell your driver you are going to the location on Flamingo Dr. Our Driver kept pulling up the old location, causing us to be late to our reservation. 

The food is so flavorful, I will be dreaming about their curries until I am able to come back. We ordered the Crispy Duck with Panag, Garlic Prawns, Beef Pad Se-Ew, Fried Rice, and the Papya salad (mild) - everything is served family style and with a large party this was a great way to try everything! 

First let me say that the crispy duck was palate changing! I normally never eat duck because I find it fatty and chewy. The way they fry the duck to make it crispy and light is just amazing. Added with the sauce and noddles...I will crave it for months. 

The only negative about the Lotus of Siam is that even WITH reservations, we waited over 30 minutes for our table to be prepared. I get it, we were there on a Saturday night, but what is the point in reservations if you are still waiting over 30 minutes? Also, because it was cold the weekend we went, the draft from the door opening and closing hit our table full force. I had to leave my coat on. 

Overall, I am still looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food and drink was great. Service was great. I suggest making a reservation as many people seem to know how good it is here. From the outside you make think it a dive, it is definitely not."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the best Thai food restaurants in vegas. You can see that by how busy they are no matter what day or time you go in. The wait is usually not too bad as they get food out fast. The crispy duck is simply delicious. Most of the other dishes I have had here before were very good too. Prices are very good too unless you are getting seasonal fish. Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"I won't say anything new that someone hasn't already said about this place...it's a jewel. Ok, nevermind, I'll say something...one word...Crispy Duck."}
{"text":"They gave us a small table for 5 people. How do you expect us to have a dinner if you can't even fit all the food on the table! Zzz excellent food. Almost everything we got was good and well cooked and seasoned . I usually don't like Thai food but it satisfied me."}
{"text":"We did not have a single bad dish. The food is excellent. Don't forget to order from the Northern Menu. The larb is good, the chilean sea bass is delicately prepared. The Garlic shrimp is awesome! The seafood drunkin noodles is perfectly cooked without being too greasy like many other spots.

The wine pour is very poor. So that is my only complaint"}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai place in the US.  My wife and I visit them every time we visit Las Vegas and sometimes more than once.  The quality, taste and value of the meal is always great and it's nice to get away from the high prices of The Strip."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a trip off the strip as some of the best food is off the strip. Went at 1130am on a Monday got seated right away but by the time we were leaving there was a wait. Food was very good. Be careful when ordering spice level as this is not American spice scale. We ordered a 5/10 and it was hot. Stuffed chicken wings and crispy rice were delicious. Dinner you must have reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious Vegas Thai restaurant located close to Chinatown.  They're known for their fried catfish entree (according to my friend) but other stuff on the menu is also good. We came in during lunch and they have a buffet deal which is really popular, but we ordered off the menu because it looked like buffet food you could get in Hollywood Thai Town.  We had the beef salad, catfish fillet, shrimp bacon appetizer, pad thai.  The catfish fillet was small though and was just ok.  Next time we should order the whole fish to get a better sense of the meal. The dishes were good and we could taste the love they put in them.  Will come back to try other great dishes."}
{"text":"Overall: I used to dream about returning to Las Vegas for Lotus of Siam but no more. Lotus of Siam still has wonderful service and this location is much nicer than the previous, but it has lost its touch on balancing flavors.

Food: 2

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: The broth used to be flavorful and perfectly balanced. Now, it lacks umaminess and it's far too sour. The toppings were not as good as last time, as it lacked the necessary garlic.

Yum Woon Sen is a \"salad\" consisting of cellophane noodles, greens, and seafood with a chili and lime juice dressing. I write \"salad\" because the amount of noodle made it seem more like a noodle dish than a salad. Again, it was far too sour without any other flavors to balance it. 

Kana Plar Kem is a stir fry dish consisting of chinese broccoli and salted fish chunks. Although it was a tad too salty, it was by far the least offensive dish of the night (in terms of flavor). However, it was ridiculously expensive. It was portioned like a side dish, but it cost $13.

Northern Larb is stir fried minced pork. Again, it was far too salty, and it lacked a hint of sugar to balance the other flavors.

Sai Oua (Northern Sausage): A recurring theme seems to be food that is too salty. This dish was not exempt. The sausages were also way too dry.

Service: 5

The servers are attentive and patient with questions. When we told the manager about the poor dining experience (in terms of food), she actually comped the entire meal for us!

Ambiance: 4

Long gone was the old mom and pop feel of the old restaurant. This new building feels like an upscale, Americanized eatery. There's a bar for waiting patrons, and several enclosed private dining areas along with the main dining room. It does feel a little cramped, but that may be due to the sheer amount of people inside."}
{"text":"Overall: Lotus of Siam dishes out some of the best Thai food that I've ever had. I'll be dreaming of it until I return to Vegas.

Food: 5

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: This was hands down the best version that we've ever had. The most important part is the broth, and they nailed it. The broth was flavorful but perfectly balanced. Their spiciness levels range from 1 to 10. We chose 5, and it was just mildly spicy. Spice wimps like me will feel some heat, but you might want to choose a higher number if you want spicy food as my mom didn't even realize it was spicy.

Pad See Ew with Chicken: This was a-okay. The chicken was well cooked, but the noodles lacked the char that I usually want in this dish. The portion is a tad small for the price.

Crab Fried Rice: I told my mom that this fried rice was better than hers, and that's high praise. Fried rice usually entails rice that does not clump or stick together. The individual grains of rice must be separate, but that usually causes it to taste a little dry. Somehow, they've managed to make fried rice that is fluffy and soft but separate. The egg is also perfectly cooked so that it's fluffy and moist. There is also plenty of crab.

Note: There food does lean towards the saltier side, but I don't mind.

Service: 4.5

The wait staff is polite and patient when you're ordering. I like that our waiter didn't hover over us throughout the entire meal yet he still managed to ensure that our water glasses were never empty. However, it is a little hard to flag someone down if you need something because they're so busy.

Ambiance: 4.5

The restaurant is deceivingly large, but it somehow manages to procure a wait list. Don't fret over the waitlist! The hostess told me that the wait for our party of 3 would be about an hour, but we were seated within 20 minutes. There is also an extremely large parking lot, so you don't have to worry about that."}
{"text":"I love it. The charbroiled prawns were amazing, even with mouth on fire from the chilis (we got the spicy ones). Definitely order some of the northern Thai dishes the place is known for.  The only thing we got that was just average was the Drunken Noodles - I've had better elsewhere.  But even they were devoured by the end of the meal.  I will make this a must-eat on Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"After seeing so much good reviews on yelp & on the media I decided to check this place out. The location is very concealed away from the strip. I had a bit of a hard time looking for it but after a few rounds in the shopping center I've seen the green light!! I came around dinner time 8ish to be exact. There was a wait and a bunch of people already waiting in the waiting, I was not surprised. I waited less than the 30min they said it would take to be seated. I was very amused at how fast I was able to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is nice and big. I didn't realize it could seat a lot of people AND I MEAN A LOT!! It was packed for a Monday night. 

As soon as we got seated I quickly glanced over the menu and ordered right away. I was very hungry. I ordered the papaya salad, charbroiled pork, red curry, and Tom yum. Let's start with the papaya salad. My server asked what spice level I would like my Papaya salad to have ranging from a 1-10, I said a 3. When I took my first bite of the salad I was expecting a mild taste, but no it felt like a burning 10!!! The spice was too overpowering and I could hardly taste the real flavor of the salad. I had a Thai iced tea on the side & I literally gulped more than half just so my mouth could cool down. I was very upset :( I love papaya salad and just having this to be too spicy really just killed my appetite. I ordered the red curry with beef. I was scared that it was going to be really spicy like the papaya salad but it wasn't at all! It had a small hint of spicy. It was so creamy and delicious. Just thinking about it is making my mouth salivate. The charbroiled pork was amazing as well! But I could compare it to other charbroiled pork I've had at other Thai/Vietnamese restaurants. The only thing that stood out about it was the dipping sauce. I'm not quite sure what type of sauce it was but it had green onions and was a cross between salty, sour, and sweet. The Tom yum was ok. Like other yelpers have mention it's nothing that's great. 

The customer service was spectacular. We always had our waters and rice refilled & asked how we were doing. 

Will definitely come back here again & try the northern menu like others have suggested."}
{"text":"I had the crispy duck and garlic prawns. They were very tasteful. However expensive for small portions."}
{"text":"This is the best, most authentic Thai restaurant outside of Thailand ! 

Most Thai restaurants in the U.S. are really set up for western taste buds. Meaning, they are not really the type or the taste of food you get in Thailand. At Lotus of Siam, yes, they have the Pad Thai and things like that for those who do not like the spiciness of traditional Thai food, but what they also have is a great selection of true traditional Thai dishes, meaning they are spicy. 

If you want to eat true Thai food, look on the menu under the Northern Thai section and the Chef's Choice. The food is great !

This restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. 

This restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice. 

Finally, this is a very popular restaurant. People pack the place every day and night of the week. It is best to make a reservation or you may be waiting quite a while for a table.

Highly Recommended !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We come here every year for our company's last dinner in Vegas and every year it's just as good as I remember.  The wine list is insane and food is very good.  Not much to say since it's a pretty famous place other than I look forward to this meal every year and would eat here often if I lived even remotely close."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a tad bit overrated. During my experiences, I had to admit I was a bit disappointed at the service and the food. The server managed to mess of a couple of orders at our table and the food was just okay. I did go in having high expectations since I had heard from others that this is the \"best thai food in all of vegas.\" Well at the end of the day, I could see how that opinion was formulated, as there are not that many great asian restaurants in Las Vegas...period. Vegas is more of an Italian, French and Sushi type of city. 

I have tried garlic chicken wings, which are supposedly \"sauteed with a lot of garlic, black pepper, and seasoning.\" UM these were just plain old dry chicken wings. There were some flakes of salt, pepper and garlic on the side which wouldn't even stick to the wings. I tried one bite and was finished...dry and flavorless.

I also tried the drunken noodles which were just okay. Maybe 3 of our 5 stars at best. Some of my friends ordered some dishes off the Northern menu, which were actually decent. 

Overall, this is an average Thai restaurant and I would not return!"}
{"text":"mmmmm!!!!! good ass thai! crab fried rice and beef lard na! and of course ground basil chicken. good idea to make reservations sometimes this place is crazy jammed!!!!!!!!!!


i love this place. ive seen alot of bad rating, but this place is good.. must be one of those hit or miss..."}
{"text":"Went twice in less than a week.  It's the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to, and it has one of the best wine lists I've seen anywhere.  Wonderful service puts it over the top.  6 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting to come here but never get the chance to. From what I understand, there is always a long wait. We decided to come right when try opened for dinner, so the wait wasn't bad at all. 
We ordered their soup, which was a little on the sour side, but still tasty. Their crispy duck was very tasty, but the portion was smaller than expected. Their pad see ew was very good! Even though we were very full, we decided to try their fried bananas with coconut ice cream. It was delicious! 
Their service was outstanding, which a quite different than what we are used to getting at Asian restaurants. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best Thai on the planet Earth.  This place is off the strip in a strip mall.  The lady has been cooking here for over 30 years!.  Make reservations for dinner at least 2 weeks in advance.  Lunch is easy if you show up when they open.  Crispy Rice, Duck with drunken noodles are the stars of this show. Try the Larb from the northern menu if you want something new."}
{"text":"***** this restaurant for sure is not 2 \"$$\" signs. I would say 3 \"$$$\" at least (a bit misleading)

Have been wanting to come to this place; however, they only open for dinner hours and I often missed it. Got here at 8:30pm on Sunday. The host told me that the wait was 1 hour. I decided to wait.

Service was slow. There were 2 waiters (Asian and Caucasian) serving the area where I was sitting. I asked for hot water with lemon. The Asian waiter came back with just hot water. He brought me orange and lime, and told me that they were out of lemon. However, I saw that he served another table (non-Asians, who ordered after us) with lemon. We told the Caucasian waiter that we are ready to order, and he did not take our order. Instead, he served another table (non-Asians). I did not know that they serve customers according to their ethnicities (Asians have to wait to be served). 

We ordered Thai iced tea ($4.95), but was told that they were out of it. This is interesting - Thai restaurant is out of Thai iced tea! 

Ordered crispy rice salad, garlic pawns, beef khoi soi, and crispy duck curry. 

Crispy rice salad: it had too much green onion, onion, and cilantro. Those greens were too overpowering. 

Garlic pawns: this is a must try if you are willing to spend $29.95 for a dish. Pawns were soft and well seasoned. 

Beef Khoi soi: nothing like the real one in Thailand. The curry soup base was tasteless. Disappointed.

Crispy duck curry: great favor on both the duck and curry. The duck was super tender in the inside and crispy on the outside. 

The dishes came with rice, and the rice was very hard and dry, which was another disappointment."}
{"text":"Lotus of  Siam is great American-style Thai cuisine. Unfortunately, the previous reviews on yelp don't really say this, or maybe I didn't read enough of them. Either way, now begins the review.
Lotus has hands-down the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. If this was 15 years ago, I would've given this place 5 stars. But just like I am no longer a chubby teenager, my taste for fried, overly-sweet, food has passed. The chow mein and pad thai were both good, but their respective sauces were too rich. Or something. Just not 4 stars on yelp good.
Myself and my eating partner both got the buffet at lunch for $9.99, so discussing the portions is dumb. Let's move along. The service was fast (for a buffet) and water was brought to the table promptly. The used buffet plates disappeared in less than a minute when pushed to the edge of the table.
Lotus is great if you prefer less-than-traditional Thai food."}
{"text":"What is there to say? This is the best of the best!  I have eaten here about ten times and it gets better each time. They always have the best quality ingredients and service.  When you come in you need to try the sea bass and the garlic prawns.  Finish the meal off with the sliced mango and sticky rice and you are set.  Make sure that you start with the mushroom and chicken soup.  Also, only order off the northern Thai menu towards the back."}
{"text":"I have finally made it here. My first time and it was good. I am a novice to Thai food. I did follow the advice and ordered off the northern Thai part of the menu. I had the northern sausage, the red chili dip, crispy duck with mint and Thai basil and chili. I finished off with mango and sticky rice topped with coconut milk and mong bee seeds. 

I got the heat at 2-3. Next time I'll go for 4-5."}
{"text":"Will I be hated for this review?? 

Everyone seems to rave about this place... and I've noted it being called the BEST Thai restaurant on the continent... 

I don't know if I have had quite enough Thai food to agree or disagree to this statement, but I feel that Lotus of Siam will be marked as average in my book. 

Upon entering, you are already on your toes because the man who asked to clean your windshield may have followed you in, or a person waiting for the Green Door to open may be scouting out its next victim. But, to be honest, once you are inside, and away from the \"waiting area\" it is surprisingly nice and open. 

I felt my table was too close to the table next to us, but whatevs. Our server was a little slow to get to us, that is understandable... but after that, he was on top of everything! I got my Thai usual of green chicken curry. It was good, nothing out of the ordinary deliciousness of curry... And friends got their American Thai food staples in which I will not make a comment.

I don't think I would drive to this place again, if I am in the area... (which i hope isn't too often) I will be back. I think your neighborhood Thai restaurant will give you the fix you need, is not better. If I want anything extra-ordinary I will hit up my grandma."}
{"text":"best thai in vegas hands down...perfect whole in the wall in a ugly strip mall with amazing food...cant go wrong here if you like thai food"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Las Vegas.  My favorite dishes are - Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice w/ sausage), Sai Oua (northern style sausage), drunken noodle sea bass, crispy duck with chili mint leaves & salmon panang.  They also have a great wine list featuring many outstanding German rieslings.  Get the mango dessert if it's in season."}
{"text":"Ok it's more like 2.5 stars.. Il make this review quick n straight to the point..the food is good.. I ordered the pad tai,  pad see wu,  Isaan sausage,  stuffed chicken wings n hot n sour soup.. Liked everything especially the stuffed chicken but not worth the wait and my biggest downer.... The portion size! . I know plenty of Thai restaurants w same quality food w way bigger portions.. I get the food is good but give us more!

One more thing.. One of there desserts was the mango w sticky rice. When i tried to order it they said mangos were not in season... Uh I just bought mangos at the market n had mangos at a restaurant in aria.. So how can it be out of season.?"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Seems like an unassuming little place in a strip mall but your in for a shock when you go inside. The food is authentic, full of flavor and just plain delicious, you just can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Food: Exceptional. A more refined take on traditional Thai cuisine.

Service: Nothing to write home about.

Ambience: Feels a bit crowded. Waiting area is tiny."}
{"text":"We have lived in vegas for 6 years and always heard great things about this place. We finally tried it tonight and it was AMAZING!!!! The only reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is bc of the location. It's a little sketchy but don't let that fool u. Inside is beautiful! There is almost always a wait but def worth waiting for. They have a cute little bar you can have a drink at while waiting. I def recommend trying the shrimp pad Thai and the crispy duck! YUM :)"}
{"text":"Yes it takes a while to get in if you don't have reservations and the decor is not top notch. The food on the other hand... Is it tasty? Yes. Is it authentic? Yes! Try their Northeastern style Thai food, it's so good!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian, so that's what I am reviewing. There isn't a vegetarian section of the menu here, but from the sound of it when I spoke to the waiter, it isn't uncommon for folks to request vegetarian versions of things, so I guess you can always ask!

I got the Rad Na with tofu and mushrooms and specified that it needed to be vegetarian (in case of fish sauce, which is common) and mentioned my egg allergy and things came out okay. It was a lot saucier than I expected (it looked like soup when it came out, actually), but was tasty nonetheless. I also got a Thai iced coffee, and that was tasty (as it always seems to be, regardless of restaurant).

My non-vegetarian compatriots apparently thought the wonton soup was amazing (and ended up ordering two more rounds of the stuff, one more for the table and one solely for one person who liked it that much). Mr. Piano got the pad thai, and thought that was fine. The others I believe also ordered the sea bass and the crispy duck, and I think they preferred the duck. Not 100% sure on that. But they all felt it was quite good, so I'm inclined to believe them.

The décor and setting of the place is rather nice, and the service is pretty good. The menu is admittedly very large, so it's surprising that they can keep up with it and execute such a wide variety of dishes well. Also, that could be a problem for the terminally indecisive or the easily overwhelmed. Still, no vegetarian section, which would have been nice. The actual location of the place is a bit desolate (it seems like an abandoned strip mall, except for the Korean BBQ place which may or may not be on life support via the Korean tour bus we saw headed there), and we definitely arrived right when they were opening (with reservations, since there were 7 of us) and there was a line past two dead shop fronts before they started letting people in, so if you don't have a reservation, be aware that there's a lot of people going here for dinner. On a Monday, even.

That said, I didn't notice it being significantly better than other Thai food I've had, but since I could only try one dish and everyone else liked it so much, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'd certainly eat here again if in the area--it's a good value for the money, and tasty :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is served in a timely manner. It has a great taste and presentation. Their wine selection is excellent. I suggest pairing your food with a wine of your choice. Great place for a family dinner or date night. The front on the restaurant can be deceiving, but just walk in to see what a gem this place is."}
{"text":"Lotus is a big restaurant with small restaurant service and quality. The crispy pork belly, yellow curry, pineapple fried rice, and summer rolls were ALL 5 out of 5. The veggies in every dish were crisp and fresh! Lotus will basically ruin all other Thai restaurants for you. Sorry not sorry! Make a reservation and if you have to wait - it's worth it. Have a drink at the bar ;)"}
{"text":"We had reservations, which was a good thing - the place was jumping on the weekend.  I was impressed by the breadth of their menu - Northern dishes, Southern dishes, house specialties.  Definitely a welcome change from the strip, and I was impressed by their wine list."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has a reputation as an excellent Thai restaurant.  It deserves its reputation.  A few brief observations:
* Reviewers warn against the buffet, which is standard Chinese.  From what I saw, I'll second that view.  Order interesting Thai food from the menu.  Be sure to ask for the Northern menu, which has many good choices as well.
* I had Nam Kao Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanut, and lots of crispy rice); charbroiled catfish; sticky rice with mango.  It was a lot of food, and everything was very good.
* The food tends to be very, very hot.  Fortunately, you get to specify how spicy you want things.  Your waiter will ask you how hot you want your food on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the hottest.  I ordered level 3 to be safe, and it was still pretty hot.
* The address is on Sahara Avenue.  However, that's the BACK of the restaurant.  Don't run away in horror; instead, drive around to the other side.  It turns out to be a shopping mall, with the entrance to Lotus of Siam.  Once you get inside, you won't be much more impressed with the decor.  Don't worry - it's a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place has a Northern Thai focus which is great cause you can find dishes here that are hard to find other places. I don't think I have eaten at a better Thai restaurant in my life."}
{"text":"What can I say? You either love this place, or you hate it. I fall solidly on the love end of the spectrum. I give it 5 stars on food quality, but the ambiance and atmosphere are most definitely lacking. Maybe it was the strip mall it's in. Maybe it was the crowded tables and disjointed service (four separate waiters? spilling water all over the place? 15 minutes for a thai iced tea?). Maybe it was our cab driver telling us that as recently as a few months ago, he would shoot up in the parking lot, as this was a well-known drug hang out, and he would not drive to this part of town after dark (that's a whole other story).

So if you're looking for some bomb ass thai food (and yes, it just might be the best in the country) and are willing to deal with some superficial shortcomings, this place is worth the trek from the strip."}
{"text":"The best Thai food on the Western Hemisphere! 

Nothing in Vegas beats this place 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Okay so we pull up to the shady abandoned strip mall that this place is located in- with an adult daycare next door, homeless people outside, and trash galore... BUT WHEN WE WALKED IN.... Stunning! The rooms are beautiful and clean- the staff is friendly but very foreign (don't ask them to explain the menu, they just smile and nod) - I ordered the duck soup- DELICIOUS! Best I've ever had! Completely authentic and delectable! I cannot write enough compliments on the food! It gets busy so plan ahead! Best kept secret in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, no frills, just really really good. Spicy and well prepared, with a knowledgeable wait staff and good beverage selection.  Close to the strip and good size so you won't have to wait long.  Great example of a restaurant that's off the beaten path but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"They bought the unit next door and expanded the restaurant, lots of seating now.   Still exceptional as always."}
{"text":"Very good Food!!! When in this area of Las Vegas make sure to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food EVER! I have to admit I was worried when I saw where it was located (ghetto area off the strip) but once you open the door, you walk into another world!!! Super impressive wine list. The waiter made recommendations so we just ate what he suggested. The coconut soup was rich and better than any soup from any other Thai place I've ever been. 
Take a cab or walk if you have to...just make a reservation and go!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars ! 

This place gets busy!!! So come right when they open. Their reservation list also gets filled quick so make reservations in advance. Me and my friends came here and waited like 30-45 mins. I find their service to be somewhat slow, not because our waiter was slow, but because their waitstaff was slow when setting up and cleaning the tables. The food came out at a decent time considering they were extremely packed on a Saturday night. 

The only big problem I have with this place is that their portions are pretty small. If you plan on sharing with a big group of people, I suggest ordering two of the same dish. Their noodle & curry dishes were especially small. Also when we ordered the mango sticky rice, there wasn't that much rice, it was a horrible mango to rice ratio.

Must get: according to my friends their crispy garlic prawns! This is a must, my friends were drooling over this dish for the longest time. They also said the duck curry is delicious as well. Oh and order the Thai tea as your drink. 

I tried their fried tofu, pad see ew and pad Thai. All these dishes taste the same everywhere else, it just cost more here and the portions are a lot smaller. 

Mango sticky rice was bomb! Loved how the rice wasn't too sweet, it was perfect, just wish there was more rice. The fried bananas were also yummy as well if you like bananas. 

Overall a yummy dinner, this place is just expensive for the amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"So, there's been a major hype about this place for a LOOOOOOONG time. I stopped by here back in 2008, and got a ton of food as a take-out and wasn't impressed at the time. 

My second visit was back in 2011, and I thought the food was good at that time, but wasn't blown away. 

My recent visit, I went with a group and ordered several different items to try.

Garlic prawns- 5 stars. This is a must order. I would come back and get this without a question. 

Crispy duck panning curry - 2 stars. The panang curry was a bit lacking for me, and the duck was the best part. 

Stuffed chicken wings- 5 stars. This dish is SOOOO Good. It is stuffed with the insides of vietnamese egg roll type ingredients. I LOVED it. 

Drunken noodles- 2 stars.  I did a double take on this dish, as it was supposed to be an entree, but looked like an appetizer. I felt soooo jipped, and the dish wasn't even that great either. The chicken pieces were dry, and the noodles did not have good flavor. 

Crispy rice dish appetizer- 2 stars.  This dish has basically the flavors of larb on crispy rice. I LOVE larb, and prefer to have it incorporated into ground meats, so I thought this was meh. 

I hear this is one of the best thai places. I've given three tries to finally write this review, and I gotta say, maybe there's too much hype?"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is ranked among the highest in Las Vegas with so may awards hanging on the walls. I tried the food and it was good, but I have tasted better Thai food at few other smaller restaurants in Los Angeles. In my opinion, the reason that this restaurant has received so many awards is because this restaurant by far serves the most extensive menu. I don't rink there is any food left in Thailand that is not served at this restaurant. 
Still, I expect this restaurant to serve a better Thai ice tea than serving a ready made one bought in the market. 
I relatively eat spicy food in other restaurants, but I can't handle any Thai food with spice level rated more than 3, while they serve food up to spice level of 9. The spice numbering system is very tricky and the servers need to warn the novice customers when they order the spice level of the food higher than three."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 stars.  We opted for menu rather then buffet (kind of an expensive alternative, bill was $65 without drinks versus $22).   Chen was the server and was so fantastic.  
Location: In the ghetto in the shittiest shopping center I have seen.  I honestly expected to get shanked on the way in.  I think I have been to the tranny bar in the corner of this exact shopping mall on a seedier Vegas trip (not joking).
Facility:  Surprisingly nice.  Updated and some nice finishes.  In typical Thai restaurant fashion, a bit hodge podge, but it was clean.
Food:  The garlic pepper prawns are amazing.  Soups were flavorful and super yum.  I wish I had ordered the bowls as the cups were not enough.  The Papaya salad was good, but not very flavorful (where is the chili?!?).  The north thai coconut curry dish was relish....

This would have been a 4 star but there was a BIG BLACK HAIR in my food.  Ewwww.  I got Chen's attention and subtlety pointed it out without saying a word to not embarrass the restaurant or draw attention.  A quick apology and they remade it (about 10 minutes later).  But, come on, give us a drink or an appetizer while we wait or something.  

Glad we tried it, would not return."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is really good Thai food.  It is clearly not in the world's best location, but you are going to Lotus for the food, not the massage parlor next door.  The menu is quite elaborate, and there are some unique items.  I typically ask the waiter for his recommendations and go with them. 

The recommendations were all good, but I think that they recommend the same stuff to everyone.  I told him that we were adventurous, but he basically recommended the same stuff.  Jumbo Prawns (so-so), Crispy Duck (good sauce), some coconut milk dish with noodles (bland), Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass (great noodles), and pork satay (yum).

The main thing that I would have changed with my order was to make things more spicy. I'm a big spicy guy, but this was pretty mellow.  I am confused why he did not ask us the level of spiciness that we wanted.

Overall, this is probably one of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas (and most likely Nevada).  If you are in town, its worth the journey to the north side of the strip to check it out."}
{"text":"I love their Penang curry with crispy duck! The best I've ever had. Hands down! 5 stars

The service was attentive 4 stars, sometimes snooty or seemingly cold personalities. 

Decore is 3 stars. Definitely needs to be better. 

Portions are small for the price. The quality of the food is good. 

Price is pretty high but still worth it for the curry. 

I'd come Bach and do recommend this place but bring some real money cause it's on the higher price side."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've ever been to! We're from California and spent a few days in Las Vegas and were told by family members that we had to check this place out. We were so happy that we did. We could tell right away that this place was going to be good by the long line waiting by the front door before it was even open. 

The restaurant filled very quickly and the wait wasn't too long. We ordered the whole catfish, garlic prawns, stuffed chicken wings, chicken sa-tay, and pad thai. All very delicious! I definitely recommend the pad thai. We ordered 2 additional orders to take back home with us. Their peanut sauce is amazing! 

We will definitely be back the next time we are in Las Vegas. And if you are in the area make this place a priority."}
{"text":"Come for the food - stay for the Riesling!!!
Garlic prawns, crispy duck  and BBQ beef salad were standouts!! An absolute ridiculous selection of beautiful old Rieslings"}
{"text":"Sorry to buck the trend here, and I know how wildly popular this restaurant is with Yelp L.A. , but I felt underwhelmed.  The location is dodgy, not convenient, and complete with a selection of panhandlers. The food was of average quality and selection even for Las Vegas. I totally get it: Yelpers love Lotus of Siam. They should be proud of attracting the Yelp crowd. I won't be returning. My experience was just average especially for a business lunch. Bargain hunters looking for a good meal on the fly before heading back to L.A. would definitely enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"This restaraunt was a recommendation from a friend of mind and a lot of people seemed to know about this gem.

Right when we pulled up, we could tell this place was popular.  Large groups outside waiting for a table.  So that was a good sign.  We had a reservation but showed up way early so we hung out at the bar and had a few drinks.  I totally fell in love with their banzai bunny sparkling sake white peach flavor!!!  It's on the sweet side so if that's not your thing you may not like it. 

Soon after sitting at the bar we got our table.  So service was already on point in helping us get our table early.  We ordered the crispy duck in curry sauce, garlic prawns and crab fried rice.  Pretty much the most popular items. And they were all delicious!!!  My favorite were the prawns and rice.  My wife fell in love with the duck.  And those 3 dishes filled us up good.  Be aware thought, it gets a little pricey.  For 2 people the bill was almost $140.

Either way we had a great experience and would definitely come back to try some other items we saw on the menu that looked so good."}
{"text":"Holy crap, that was a meal. The nam kao tod alone is worth five stars. Super crispy rice, but also super tangy. I had the soft shell crab over drunken noodles, it was good but not life-changing. My mother-in-law had the mussel fried omelette, crispy and amazing. My wife had the Thai spaghetti, it was fine. My father-in-law had a beef dish over noodles that was amazingly tender and also tasty. Mango and sticky rice dessert was ok. We ate everything.

The location is abominable, though rather than wait for a cab, we took the very crappy 20-minute walk back to Las Vegas Blvd. Man, Vegas needs Uber badly. Definitely still worth the visit, and I did derive pleasure from exactly how phenomenally crappy the external surroundings were."}
{"text":"great Thai food.  need a reservation cause it's always packed.  komol a few doors down is a great alternative if you don't want to wait"}
{"text":"The hype didn't meet my expectations. I mean the food was good, but honestly it tasted like any other Thai restaurant. We ordered from their \"northern\" section of the menu but I wasn't blown away with the food.

The saving grace was the dessert there... If you ever go, you HAVE to try their coconut ice cream with their banana eggroll thing. It's like the best thing I've ever had in life. It says a lot coming from a guy who isn't into desserts."}
{"text":"Very good! As others have said get there early I came 15 minutes before the dinner doors opened and was the 5th or so table seated. 
Forgive me for forgetting the thai names but the crispy rice appetizer, and the basil scallops were terrific! Incredible wine list and options and a comfortable but in memorable dining space. But who needs to remember the dining room when the food is so good?"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and the best wine list I've ever seen at a Thai restaurant. Service was spot on. Look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Food was amazinggggg! Authentic! Best Thai food I've ever had. EXCEPT we didn't call to make a reservation therefore we waited for more than an hour and a half...plus, because we were a big group. But once we were seated the food came quick and customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place where limos and many more Caucasian people mingle with eastern Asian cuisine. The truth is there are many authentic and good restaurants out there for much cheaper, but this one speaks English well to cater to the masses and is just crazy popular because of it. I'm sure their business and price tag keeps everything fresh and good too. 

I would love to return and eat there often, but the high prices make that a less reasonable endeavor than other alternatives."}
{"text":"At last, after long wanting to sample the world-renowned and award-winning dishes here firsthand, I finally did the deed, sitting down to lunch with local Yelp friend Norm K.  After perusing the huge menu at length, we settled on splitting a large bowl of Tom Kah Kai Soup; Pad Woonsen with shrimp, chicken, beef, sauteed Cellophane Noodles, tomatoes, Black Mushrooms, egg, Green Onion, White Onion, and Cilantro; Garlic Prawns; and Thai Crab Fried Rice.  Our competent and efficient server asked what spice level between 1 and 10 we desired for the soup, and Norm said \"7\" while I simultaneously said \"2 or 3\".  Norm charitably agreed to a \"3\".  The soup was excellent, cooked with Coconut Milk in the classic manner.  And, while I found the spice level to not be overwhelming, it qualified as a bit higher than mild.

Pad Woonsen with several ingredients and our three types of protein was a fine, satisfying dish.    And, the vaunted Garlic Prawns deserve their reputation; they were outstanding.  Tasty enough that to my surprise I, too, ate the well-cooked prawn shells, and enjoyed them in addition to the crustacean nestling inside!  

Only the Thai Crab Fried Rice, with tomatoes, onion, and crab meat was a disappointment: bland with little noticeable pieces of clam.  Making up for this, the complimentary large-grain Steamed White Rice was superior to the customary plebeian variety served at most Asian restaurants.  I also appreciated that regular Iced Tea was served here in addition to Thai Iced Tea.  And I quickly received a tray of condiment sauces on request.

I will surely return to try other offerings here!  XXXX-1/2 overall!"}
{"text":"Wow, was Lotus of Siam excellent! Wonderful service, the most extensive list of German wines I've seen outside of Germany (and what could go better with Thai food than German wine?) and outstanding food, the best Thai I've ever had. The northern Thai sausage was my favorite item, followed closely by the eggplant and mushroom appetizer. Lots of complex flavors expertly developed. My thanks to Anthony Bourdain for the recommendation."}
{"text":"3.5

I kept seeing write ups on this place as such a good place to check out, but I didn't think it was anything special.

The food was good to above average.  The service was friendly.  But that's about it.

Oishi Thai in Miami is such a better experience."}
{"text":"Definently worth a stop off the strip to get this very delicious Thai food.  I mean good food at reasonable prices, unheard of in Las Vegas nowadays.  We enjoyed everything that we ordered (Mussamun Chicken Curry, Pad Thai, Pad Prik Khing, and Panang Curry).  We also had a few of the appetizers (one of them has crispy rice in it and it had really great texture and was spicy and a little sour and salty all in one!)  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place will have you swinging! No, I'm not referring to the swingers club that shares the parking lot, instead the \"off the chains\" food. Arrive early or attempt to get reservation if you want to visit Lotus of Siam. From the outside it's unassuming and quiet but once inside it's bustling with excited foodie patrons. The menu is large, offering numerous dishes from multiple regions of Thailand. Do yourself a favor and order from the Northern or Chef Specials sections, you will not be disappointed. 

Our party of 4 tried:

Koong Sarong - Very good, not greasy at all. Good dish for the less adventurous people in your party.
Nam Kao Top - (Spicy Level 4) While very limey, it's balanced much better when eaten with the cabbage.
Garlic Prawns - My favorite dish of the night. I was not a huge fan of eating the shell but I tried it and enjoyed one. The shell was much more tender than I thought it would be but a little on the salty side. The actual prawn meat was delicious, perfectly cooked with a slight crisp on the outside.
Crispy Duck with Panang - (Level 3) While I'm not a huge fan of duck, I had heard a lot about this dish and had to try it. The duck was cooked perfectly, crispy skin and moist on the inside. The meat was not overly fatty like I'm used to eating and the curry sauce was different (no coconut milk) but a great addition to the overall flavor.
Nua Nam Tok - (Spice Level 4) Very similar to the flavors of the Nam Kao Top, good but not great.

We noticed many people ordering the soups, especially the Fish Soup but it was over 105 degrees that day and soup was the furthest thing from what I wanted. It looked wonderful and will be my order when I go back in the winter.

Lotus is perfect for taking visiting friends from out of town who want to experience Vegas food off the strip. The food is good, the service was incredibly good, way better than I expected. If you're lucky you can start up a conversation with the James Beard winning Chef Saipin Chutima who was spotted multiple times walking through the dining area.

This is a must visit for anybody who lives in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't go the buffet route! After reading multiple reviews on yelp I elected to take my family there for lunch -- we decided on the buffet and OMG -- where was all the hype?? I would rather have china star.. Every dish was typical and boring.. Fried rice, beef broccoli, chow mein, blah, blah, blah.. Sorry -- no exceptional dishes to boast about.."}
{"text":"Food Network said this place is some of the best Thai Food you can find anywhere in the country. I have to agree with them. We
came during lunch. The shopping center where the restaurant is located is suspect. However, once we went inside we were greeted by a nice staff and our food flew out of the kitchen. The highlight of our lunch was the deep fried pampano with sweet and sour sauce. The pad thai is fresh and tasty. The stuffed chicken wings were a pleasant surprise. Think a pork egg roll stuffed into
a chicken wing. If you are in Vegas, get off the strip and visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight's feast - garlic prawns (soooo good!), Kaho Soi crispy duck with curry and noodles and Nam Kao Tao crispy rice. Everything was super delicious. This is definitely our favorite Thai restaurant. Love northern Thai food!!!!!!! 

The service was really good overall. They were attentive and friendly.

It was pricey though - for a large beer, appetizer and two main courses, it was about 91 including tax and tips. We picked the more expensive items. But it was so worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food at a great price - I love to bring friends here. They've recently tripled the size of their dining room so the growing popularity doesn't really affect your ability to get a table."}
{"text":"Definitely great Thai food, some of the best.  Prices are a bit high for the portions however."}
{"text":"Under all the glamour all the restaurants Vegas has to offer, I would say this one is a hidden gem located all the way at the east side. It is located in a hard to find plaza that looks very deserted! The line starts forming outside their door even before they open! Holy smokes!!! The outside of the restaurant looks run down but the inside interior is so nice! I was wearing jeans and a top and I felt under-dressed! Their servers were wearing a very nice formal attire.

I ordered the Thai papaya salad and I got a little disappointed because the flavor is amazing!!! But we asked for medium spice and I think it was very very very spice to the point that the spice is overpowering the delicious flavor of the salad! (This is the only reason I deducted 1 star, other than the bad experience with the spice, I would've given it a 5)

I ordered the Chop suey and all I can say is it brings back memory of me growing up! I grew up in the Philippines and Chop suey is my grandmother's specialty food and this tastes like my grandma's chop suey! Very nostalgic. 

I will definitely eat here again when I return to vegas!"}
{"text":"I'd read and heard so much about this place I was really excited to try it.  Lotus of Siam is located in a pretty nondescript strip mall.  It looks small from the outside, but it's way bigger than it looks!  Clearly the business is doing well!

The menu is very extensive and can feel overwhelming.  We ended up ordering an assortment of noodles, curries, and satay.  The standouts to me where the thai style tartare and the roast duck curry.  For my friends, the beef tongue was a favourite.  I see other reviews talk about the garlic prawns.  We didn't order that, but I would definitely try it next time!  While their coconut rice / ice cream dessert didn't sounds so special, I found it to be really tasty!

Compared to other thai resturants, I'm not sure if Lotus is so much better to warrant the 2x in cost / person.  Each dish wasn't that much more expensive, but I found the portions to be a little on the small side.  Their requirement that every person shows ID for credit cards was a little weird too, but I guess they must have had fraud issues in the past.  For some of the novel items though, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dump - from the outside - Inside, Paradise.
The chicken, coconut soup rocked. Powerful, yet sweet,
Pad Thai was ordered 1 in heat (Mild) My 7 yr. old chowed it.
I could go on but frankly - just don't come. Skip this ugly strip mall. That makes it easier for my hungry stomach next visit. JUST STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Always a winner for us on Vegas trips. First time at the new location for me, and it's much larger and a little nicer than the original. We were told by a server that the original would be reopened and things were in the works for a THIRD location as well! So the long waits may get shorter as your options increase. Had a meal of strictly Northern Thai dishes and the flavors are just out of this world. If you've never been, come to Lotus, flip the menu open to the back and order the Northern dishes. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Full of locals, this is what I love about getting off the Strip in Vegas!  The Tom Kahr Kah soup was awesome...get the hot pot.  Also had some great soft shell crab noodle dish...mmmm.  I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best Thai I've probably ever had. I'd heard that the chef was once a chef for the Queen of Thailand, and so had been quite impressed w the restaurants reputation and was eager to see if it lived up to the hype. It truly did. Freaking amazing.

Make reservations. This place gets PACKED all the time."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! It's our favorite Thai place in Las Vegas and we make a point of visiting every time we're in town. The shopping mall it's located in definitely isn't the greatest, but don't let that deter you or you'll be missing out!! Their food is excellent... order anything and you'll be thrilled. My favorite is the Tom Ka Gai coconut soup and any kind of curry. They're great for dine-in or to go. They have a large restaurant to accommodate big groups, but a nice atmosphere for just 2 people too. The service is excellent - many times they've easily accommodated a quick lunch during the workday. I've brought friends there and watched them become instant fans just like I did. You won't be disappointed at Lotus of Siam!"}
{"text":"The wait at this \"hole in the wall\" (if you can call it that) is crazy.  I don't know why I thought that you can't make reservations, but the other ppl around me in line thought the same thing...well, at least misery had company.  A lot of it.  We were there 15min after it opened, but had over an hour wait for a table of two.  It was a real test of will power that we stayed since we had not eaten a meal today and had hiked through the Valley of Fire.  So by the time we sat down, we were ready to order.  Luckily, things came out within 10min of ordering.  Actually, we were sat in view of the kitchen and got to see Saipan herself run the kitchen.  She really does everything...she ran my container of sticky rice out.  I thought it refreshing that she didn't feel herself too important for such a menial task.  I ordered mostly Northern Thai cuisine:  nam prik noom (spicy green chili veggie dip to be eaten with fresh veggies, pork rind, and my favorite, sticky rice), koi soi (thai beef tartare), a catfish dish, and (don't think this is issan) drunken noodle with soft crab.  Everything was good.  Thai food is known for is cacophony of seemingly unmatched flavors that come together harmoniously in the final dish.  It's an experience for your mouth.  We've been to the Northern area of Thailand, and it's very authenti...not that we need to tell you guys that.  Though my husband thought everything was just ok until we got to the final dish:  Pad Thai.  I know, right?  We're at a Northern Thai restaurant, and we order Pad Thai.  I read that it was good, and I wanted to compare this dish to others I've had.  Though I disagree with husband on this one, he said that he'd come back just for this dish.  I'm not against that at all since there was a jackfruit dish I'm still quite curious about.  (There were a lot of foods we didn't get to try on our trip.)  Though next time, we'll either call to make reservations, or just get takeout."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas?  F*kk yeah!

This spot has been tagged as a bookmark for years.  I finally got around to checking it out here.  Boy, have I been missing out!

Went with other yelpers recommendation: crispy duck with curry.  Holee sh*t!  Best duck i have ever eaten--ever!  EVER!  Every day I was in Vegas, I couldn't stop thinking about the DuCK!  Consider having the curry on the side to help maintain the crispiness of the duck...

Hawaii folks help me out.  Can i find a comparable offering of crispy duck on Oahu?  Where?!

Try the crispy duck, you will thank Yelp for guiding you here!

Another popular entree... pad kee mao with soft shell crab.  The flavor onslaught continues!  Another winner!  I am not a soft shell crab fan but gobbled up theirs!

Soon after, I was floating off the ground in a food coma!

Garans Lotus of Siam will be my first stop upon my return to Vegas!"}

Now how do you rate a thai restuarant that is known for well northern thai food and not \"thai\" food? do i rate it by what everyone is rating it, how can i when they aren't known for their pad thai or pad se ew which is some of my favorite dishes at my favorite thai restaurants. First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don't normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I'm going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of Thai food in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas and I have to say that Lotus Siam is the best I've ever had.  The food here is worth the visit to a part of Vegas I would otherwise go to.  If you are a fan of Thai food, this place is a must visit.  What makes this place special is the subtleness of the flavors.  Thai places often overwhelm - but here, the flavors are amazing without being overwhelming.

My favorite dish of the dinner was the Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck.  We also had the Tom Yum Kai Soup, Spicy Thai Beef Salad, a Yellow Chicken Curry, and the Nam Prik Ong.  I would recommend all of the dishes we had - particularly the Nam Prik Ong.  Thank you to everyone on Yelp who recommended this dish!  This place is also a great value.  Great food + great value = five stars in my book!"}
{"text":"In a suspiciously run-down strip mall far from the glitz of the strip, Las Vegas natives are enjoying beautiful saki and wonderful Thai food at the bustling hidden gem of Lotus of Siam. 

Our table ordered several dishes to share. The standout was the red curry prepared with soft, delicious, house-made egg noodles (rather than rice). Also lovely was the spicy green papaya salad. 

Although we asked for a 'medium-hot' heat level, the food was very spicy -- leaving a couple of us with watering eyes as we crunched into abundant fresh chilies.

The prices for food and wine were much more reasonable than most other good (and not so good) meals one could experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best thai food! Penang curry is a must! Shady looking place from
Outside but pleasently surprized once inside. There will be a wait...worth the great food!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times. I can never get enough. You can't get in without a reservation. The mango and sticky rice is THE BEST. Omgosh even thinking about it makes my mouth water lol. I haven't had one thing here that wasn't yummy. Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place came HIGHLY recommended by friends. So I am framing this by saying my expectations may have been too high. 

I tried NAM KAO TOD: Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice. Very good and different from anything I've ever had.
CRISPY DUCK with PANANG; Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. This was good, but didn't thrill me and it was the crispy duck that came recommended.

So again, my expectations may have been too high. That said, it was good food and suberb service. Would I tell others about it, though? No. And am I dying to go back? No.

Still ranks with 4 stars. If I lived in Las Vegas, I'd go back. Visiting from afar, I can say \"been there/done that\" and try new things next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food  Superb & authentic choices. A bit pricey though, and location could be better."}
{"text":"I've always said Thai food has a very small range of how good it can be. You have your Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Pad Kee Mao, Pineapple Fried Rice, you know, the ushe. Usually it's tasty, some better than others, but you know, nothing like omgosh my mouth just went to heaven.

Lotus of Siam changed everything.

I came out here during my bachelor party and was the first spot for dinner on our first night. It's quite a venture from the strip, and would heed caution for people coming out around the area to just be careful. We got there without making a reservation and the wait was decent but bearable. Considering we took about a 20 minute drive out, we decided to wait. There's plenty of seating, I'd say close to 100 people but this restaurant still have a wait and is poppin'.

Food we ordered:

Garlic Prawns (MUST ORDER)
Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodle
Crispy Duck Penang (MUST ORDER)
Pad Khee Mao
Spicy Fried Rice
Some sausages which I can't remember the name of 
Fried Banana w/ Coconut Bliss

Can't go through everyone item, but the garlic prawns were the winner of the dinner. I really enjoyed the Crispy Duck as well - it had a great crispiness on the outside, and it was so tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce was amazing too - just dipped everything in that sauce.

This restaurant seems to have a lot of clout and a lot of famous people come here. If you're in Vegas, make sure you take a trip out to this place - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas. My girlfriend and I came on a Thursday night to find ourselves waiting for about an hour. We were seated shortly after by our server. For an asian restaurant, the service was top notch. Our server was very kind, attentive, and quick.

We scouted out some of our favorite dishes from the menu and ended up ordering the garlic prawns, the beef pad see ew, a cup of the spicy tom yum soup, and the chicken pad thai, and the spicy chicken wings. 
Our wings arrived first and they were so good. There was just a slight kick on the spiciness radar, but that gave it what we were looking for. The tom yum soup had a good amount of spiciness to really bring out the flavor. It is a must try for everyone. The noodle consistency of the paid thai was incredible. Never have I had such good pad thai in my 26 years of being alive. The pad see ew was subpar. We did not believe that such a simple dish was overcooked and wrecked. The garlic prawns had to be the highlight of our meal. It overthrew every other dish we had on the table. Despite it being almost $30, it really made me contemplate if 8 deep fried prawns was worth it.   

We ended the night with a scoop of coconut ice cream because who doesn't like ice cream, am I right? That icy treat really hit the spot.

Overall, I had a great experience there. I ended up spending about $95 with tip included which is much higher than what I would usually pay for good Thai food. The bill and the subpar pad see ew knocked it down to 4 stars for me. Believe me, this is definitely a Vegas staple! I'll be back soon for more garlic prawns."}
{"text":"I think this place is definitely overhyped.

Chicken Pad See Ew
- your standard, same as the ones from King of Thai chain restaurant

Tofu Drunken Noodles
- extremely greasy - i had a pool of oil after finishing my noodles, tofu was slightly sour

The food isn't bad, but it wasn't great.  there's tons of great food in vegas, and this is quite pricey considering it's Thai.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get out here again."}
{"text":"Great place to go during the week for lunch . In fact, it's the only Thai restaurant I know of that does a lunch buffet! Yes, I know there are probably 17 other ones in town but I haven't been to those yet. :)

The lunch buffet has some basic items that do not change and others do. All I remember is that I enjoy going on Thursdays and Mondays. 

:TIP: If going during the week for lunch, try and get there a little early or just past the lunch rush to grab a table and not have to stand around and wait for 30 mins before being seated. Recently they just expanded so I am not sure if this is still a problem or not."}
{"text":"Came to Lotus of Siam on a friend's recommendation, told this is one of the best thai places in America. This place was very good, in fact the most complete and consistently good thai restaurant. We got several dishes, pananag, larb, crab fried rice, sea bass with drunken noodles and some others. The larb was my favorite, it was amazing! The only negative is that the portion size is a little on the small side, but other than that the food was good. Definitely would go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"You'd never expect such a small place to be so great! It truly is \"a hidden gem\". Hubby and I decided to take some take out on our way home and ended up waiting 40 minutes for an order of Chicken Satay and Chicken Panang Curry. They were so busy, and even had taxis dropping off customers on site! The only downfall to this restaurant was the entrance and first impression of it. You walk into a cramped entrance and get greeted by three ladies who weren't very professional or good at speaking English. It would've been nice to have been explained certain other menu options. Although I'd have to say the food we got was definitely worth the wait.
Hopefully next time we could try something new !"}
{"text":"One of the best in town! They have dishes I never saw in other Thai restaurants"}
{"text":"We went to this Thai restaurant in the middle of nowhere just because of the yelp reviews. The place looked so rundown and was situated in a dilapidated strip mall. But when we went inside, it was bustling with people which was a big deal since it was the Christmas Day. The spicy Thai fried rice I had and the curry which my husband had we're both very tasty."}
{"text":"The food is good, very good. Is it outstanding? No, but its very good. The problem here is that the owner-manager is very greedy. They cater to mostly tourists and so, sadly,  it became a tourist trap. They dont offer you a lunch menu if you are a tourist and you will have to pay full dinner menu prices plus they are not friendly at all. The owner manager has a huge chip in his shoulder and believes that he is so above the customers that he wont even answer questions.   He is un-polite and rude. So - go if you want but dont expect much anymore. What a shame."}
{"text":"Like most reviews on here, I am gonna go out on a limb and argue that this is probably the BEST Thai restaurant in the US. I completely agree with all of you. 

My girlfriend and I came here on our last trip as recommended by yelp, and wow am I glad we tried it. The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.

Food - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5

Then we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lol

Of course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.

Service - our waitress was a Thai lady. She practically recommended all of the dishes we ordered and even recommended which spices to use to bring out the flavor even more. Such a sweet lady =] she got a huge tip :P

Price - It's the price you'd expect to pay at a Thai restaurant.. ;) I'd gladly pay for each dish. Twice.

I need more stars for this place."}
{"text":"We came here around 5:20pm before the restaurant even opened and there was already a huge line! However, the waiters were kind enough to give us water while we were waiting.
We ordered the roasted duck curry, which was just so delicious... I actually wanted to order one more but refrained.
The garlic prawns were perfectly fried. I couldn't taste the garlicky flavor that much but this dish was a good appetizer.
The softshell crab with druken noodle was also really good. The noodles were perfectly well done.
The service was pretty slow- we didn't receive our food for twenty minutes, but the waiter apologized and actually comped us our jasmine tea and Thai iced tea, which was a nice touch.
I recommend this place, but make sure to line up early!"}
{"text":"The food is about 2/3 as good as it used to be, which all said is still very good.
The prices are 1/3 higher and starting to border on absurd. 
The environment is sterile but definitely an improvement on old spot.
The service is pretty bad. Slow, clumsy. Bad.

Most importantly for me is the wine list went from being special to pedestrian. 
So prob won't be back after so many wonderful meals. The end of an era."}
{"text":"Update:
This pace is just flat out amazing.

Food is off the charts great. Duck chu chee, pad woon seen, several northern dishes, and everything was incredible.

Wine: No matter how many times I come here, I am consistently blown away by both the varietal selection and the very reasonable prices. Their \"house cab\" is a wonderful CA cab, Hoopes. The price per glass is essentially 1/4 price of the bottle I have bought from the store. Not sure how they do that, but gives you an idea of the reasonableness of their pricing. As always, their Riesling selection is unparalleled. 

Bottom-line, don't miss this place.  In a city of soulless restaurants, Lotus of Siam stands apart."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Ambiance, or lack there of, sucks! In a seedy area but Absolutely packed on a Sunday night! Says it all!!"}
{"text":"Wow... Just Wow... 

Easily may have been one of the best meals I've had period.  Definitely the best meal I've had in the last few years regardless of cuisine type.

I figured I'd go with the popular specialties:

Garlic Prawns:

Amazing, huge, while pricey, over $20, it was a really big portion.  They were huge prawns, perfectly fried, lots of garlic, stupid good!

Crispy Duck Penang:

The duck was amazing.  And I'm picky as hell on my duck.  It wasn't overcooked.  It had a very light batter that was super crispy.  Skin was perfectly crispy.  The penang sauce was wonderful.  I don't eat a lot of Thai food so I can't compare it to other places, but it was really good.  The only compliant on this one is that its a relatively small portion for the price, also over $20.

Shrimp Pad Thai:

I figured I had to try Pad Thai done proper.  Now I can't speak towards it's actual authenticity as I haven't had it in Thailand, but it was easily the best Pad Thai I've had.  The shrimp were also really large and perfectly cooked.  The portion was medium sized, but the price was only around $12 or so, so definitely worth the money.

The place is really hard to find, it's not facing the main road, so you have to work to find it, but it's worth it.  I will definitely be stopping here every time I bounce through Vegas."}
{"text":"My second visit to the lunch buffet was as good as the first, which was a year or so ago. The hot and sour soup is amazing and I could eat bowls of it. 
The curry chicken is also great, and it's one of a few excellent entrees on the lunch buffet. Another is the pad thai, which I did not love. The orange chicken is also very good, especially paired with the fried rice. 
For dessert, there are cookies, fruit and YUMMY fried bananas wrapped in dough.  For $10.99, you could spend hours at the buffet and try everything. It really is a bargain, and everyone should try it once!"}
{"text":"Rumored to be the \"best Thai restaurant in America,\" I can say the hype isn't too far off.

You can tell LoS was born from a small mom and pop restaurant that has been expanded to meet demand, and blossomed through word of mouth alone. This is not a calculated restaurant, and reputation was built on the merit of the food. Pulling into the dilapidated strip mall parking lot, I had a small tinge of \"where the hell are we?\"

The garlic prawns feature Jurassic-sized shrimp, the shells peeled so they dangle by the same tail -- battered and deep-fried for a garlicky crunch. 

The Khao Soi curry was a bright curry with egg noodles, light on coconut milk, cut with lime juice. Highly recommend getting it with the roasted duck -- where the fat has been carefully rendered down so that each piece is crunchy and moist without excess fat. Tastes like they cut up duck confit to add to their curry.

The Tom Yum and Tom Kai soups were very complex, but very concentrated. Sharply sour, incredibly spicy (despite a \"medium\" level of spiciness.. they are NOT messing around). 

Admittedly, the papaya salad -- while good in its own right -- was a little under developed compared to the other dishes. The papaya wasn't thoroughly beaten to soften it, and thus was unable to really take up the flavor of the dressing. Can't win them all!

Lotus of Siam will be a place I will insist on stopping by every trip to Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Food is very good here. Have gone for the lunch buffet twice and was very please with the meal I got for just $10! 
The one thing I would say is that the buffet is inconsistent. Went here two weeks ago and had a dish I really enjoyed, and went again today and that wasn't even on the buffet. Disappointing, but there were some other good options as well. 
All and all good food and good price!"}
{"text":"My dearly departed friend Mark Maher recommended this place!  It's truly the most authentic Thai outside of Thailand I've ever had.  I will make sure to visit every time we are in Vegas.
Try the back portion of the menu!"}
{"text":"The service is good but I wish they would open another spot towards the other side of town because it's a long trek to get to our fave Thai place. We ordered the $45 snapper panang and it was worth it AF!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! I am now a believer in the Lotus of Siam's hype! The steak tartare salad was awesomely yummy! The beef jerky was out of this world! Those two were my favorite! Everything else were scrumptious too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! Neighborhood isn't the best, however once you are inside everything is good. The food is fantastic too. All of my friends who enjoy Thai food love to eat here. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel like every Thai restaurant I've been to, the food was always decent to good. I would never say \" out of this world' until I came here. It was a Friday night and we were seated right away when we got there ( no wait time, how cool is that?!) but maybe we were lucky. The ambiance isn't all that great but the delicious food makes up for the lack of decor. Anyone that thinks they've tried the best Thai food has to come here. My boyfriend and I shared the fried chicken with garlic appetizer. It came with about 7 pieces and they were all super crunchy and juicy on the inside with just the right amount of flavor from the garlic spices. For our main dish, I ordered the short rib curry noodles for my boyfriend and the pad-see-ew for myself. My favorite was the short rib curry noodles. I thought it would've tasted weird adding curry to noodles but the noodles were flat and light that it went well with the thick soupy sauce. The short rib was just so tender and it fell off my fork because the meat was so soft. I would definitely come here again the next time I come to Vegas. It's not on the strip ( probably about 3 miles off ) but so many people go there that there are taxis going back and forth from the restaurant to the strip. If you're planning on drinking, taking a taxi would be a smart idea."}
{"text":"The food was good but based on all the hype, I was slightly disappointed. Not to say that I didn't enjoy the meal, because I did, but I was just expecting a little more.

What we ordered: crispy wontons, tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice with chicken, seafood drunken noodles (spicy level 5), garlic prawns and roasted duck in panang curry.

As appetizers, the crispy wontons and tom yum soup were very good. The soup however left me slightly disappointed because it wasn't HOT when it came out. It was more like, warm.... why?

Out of our entrees, the roasted duck in panang curry is AN ABSOLUTE MUST. It was a favorite of the entire table. Perfect in every way possible, I wish I could eat this everyday! The garlic prawns were ordered per the server's recommendation and I'm so glad we did! It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly crispy and not drenched in oil. I even tried eating the shell and it was so good! :) 

I loveeeee seafood drunken noodles but these drunken noodles were just okay in my opinion. Again, it didn't come out very hot so that was disappointing. And the spicy level of 5 (which I heard would be pretty spicy) was not spicy at all. Also, I'm not a fan when restaurants (especially with such a hyped up name) uses imitation crab meat or anything for that matter, so that was slightly disappointing. The pineapple fried rice had yellow curry in it so that was interesting, but not quite my preference. It was just OK and I'd never order it there again. 

So with that said, the roasted duck in panang curry (under chef's selection) was amazing so make sure you try that! And the garlic prawns as well! Make sure you call ahead to make reservations. It may be hard to get a hold of them, but persistence will pay off in the end."}
{"text":"Great food and the bacon wrapped prawn are amazing. I could eat those everyday! Everything we had was very good. Definitely worth many more return visits."}
{"text":"Lotus Siam- hands down, the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to.

Ugh I think the thousands of reviews of this place already says it all. You really just have to go here to witness its greatness. Almost everything we ordered was top notch. The real standout was the sticky rice and mango. 

Don't be scared that it's in the middle of a sketchy strip mall. It'd be worth it- trust me!"}
{"text":"This place has been written up and ranked by many newspapers, magazines, and even TV shows.  The food is good, the atmosphere is slightly divey.  Prices are reasonable, but most of the people that I've gone with prefer Komol Kitchen which is across the parking lot."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best Thai Food EVER!! Excellent service and reasonable prices. Well worth the trip off the strip to eat at this gem!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome , great Thai food, there northern if you aren't into coconut , lots of wine to chose from , happy folks feeding the happy"}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago, finally had the time to do a review. Food was ok.  What got me was the bitchy waitress there, she was extremely rude. She tried to over charged us, never bring what we asked(like an extra pair of chopsticks and glass of water). I will never go back to this place again. Oh, that bitchy waitress charged us gratitude added on our bill saying we have 6 people but clearly we only have 5 people in our group. So, look very carefully at your bill before paying. They may charge you for extra things you didn't order or add a gratitude to your bill. They are super sneaky, trying to rip you off when you're not paying attention."}
{"text":"I travel in an RV all over the country. I am always looking for a good Thai restaurant. Thanks to Yelp, I found this one. I had pad woon sen and it may have been the best I have ever found. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam is a great experience! A must try place in Vegas! Wonderful variety of Thai cuisine with a friendly and efficient staff!

Definitely recommend making a reservation- this place can get busy!"}
{"text":"I went to this strip-mall restaurant based on Yelp reviews, and they were right. This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to, and I'm a big fan of Thai. The crispy rice appetizer was completely new to me and really remarkable. All four people in my party loved their entrées as well.  The only down side of this restaurant is getting there - you really have to have a car to get there. The place looks like nothing from the outside, but we arrived 15 minutes before they opened for the evening and there was already a line to get it."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 12 dudes who were looking for a casual lunch off the strip, so I suggested Lotus of Siam. After hearing a lot of great things about the dishes, we all took a bunch of cabs from the Strip to come into the side strip mall the restaurant was located. The decor inside was a little dated, but was relatively well-kept, and we were seated right away, as it was a weekday, on the later side of the lunch hour.

Our group had a lot of different types of diners, some adventurous and some not quite as adventurous, so it was good that the menu was very extensive, so that there was just about something for everyone, from fried rice and pad see ew, to more traditional Northern Thai dishes. I personally got the crispy duck penang, which was excellent. The fried bits held up really well in the curry, and the flavors with the rice made me want more and more curry. We also got the garlic prawns, and the Nam Prik Ong (chili dip). The prawns were really great and flavorful, although the chili dip was just okay to me. I liked the intense flavor of the dip, but the crudite it came with was a bit disappointing.

Service was fairly spotty throughout the meal, as we were constantly asking for drinks and water refills. To be fair, we were a large group, but on the other hand, the place wasn't particularly busy, as only a few other parties were in the restaurant. The prices were definitely on the expensive side for Thai food, but as some of us went for the more adventurous dishes to try, the bill was a little higher.

Would definitely recommend if you're trying to get off the Strip for a meal. There really is something for everyone, and the popular dishes are really something you should go for."}
{"text":"If you like it hot, you gotta get your butt over to Lotus of Siam :)

The food is amazing. Hands down the best Thai food I have ever had, even compared to LA Thai town! 

Must tries:
+ Crispy Duck over egg noodles - This duck is sooooo flavorful, the curry sauce is divine with the perfect amt of spicy and savory. And the duck is actually crispy! I will definitely be back to order this dish again. 
+ Sea Bass Drunken noodles - So the noodles portion of this was only OK....but the Sea Bass?!?!!? AMAZING. Next time I might order Sea Bass over papaya salad.
+ Spicy Squid Salad - LOVED THIS. It was very very spicy, but the seafood was incredibly fresh and the kick of lime was perfectly refreshing. 

Definitely order either the coconut ice cream or a thai tea just to cut some of that spice...

Yes, if you don't get a reservation, the wait is atrocious. We waited 1 hr to get seated. And we called in ahead of time. But they have a great system where you can literally check your spot in line from your phone and they will text/call you when your table is available. 

Also, expect to spend more $$ than you'd normally spend at a Thai restaurant. We ordered the 3 dishes above plus a sausage dish, plus tea, and spent $100....for 3 ppl....that's kinda pricey!

Tips: the parking lot is kinda creepy....make sure to lock the car!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, \"this meal was a religious experience!\"  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Seriously hands down the best Thai food here in the states! Been to so many different places all over the states and this has got to be literally the best ever! Everything is so authentic and fresh ingredients! None of that premade canned stuff! You can taste the perfection in every single bite in every single dish prepared with such passion! The location is a little in the ghetto area but once inside your fine! Place seems a little tight and small kind of but nothing beats great food! Service always on the dot and everything met with execution! Friendly warm welcoming staff is always a plus. Always packed with people always but so worth the wait and time. Must try! I continue to keep coming back with every single time I got family of friends in town I take them here right away"}
{"text":"Maybe it's my fault for having high expectations, but I was disappointed with Lotus of Siam. 

When you get inside the restaurant, they have a bunch of magazine and newspaper clippings plastered on their walls, prestigious awards (James Beard), and countless photos of celebrities and world renowned chefs. You would think that it would just be the best Thai food you will ever eat outside of Thailand (which I haven't had the pleasure of visiting, yet)?

I have a feeling it's because there aren't much options for Thai cuisine in the neighborhood that they give this place such distinction. I've had better Thai food in Los Angeles (Thai Town) and there is no shortage of Thai restaurants in LA.

Overall, I am sad that it did not live up to the hype. I'll give this place another visit in the future and see if I have a better things to say next time."}
{"text":"Got here on a Tuesday and had a 20 minute wait. The service was quick and efficient. The food was very flavorful but a little on the salty side. I would give a higher rating if the prices were lower or the portions were bigger."}
{"text":"Oh my!!! Lotus of Siam was just amazing. The spices, the flavors, and the drinks were all beyond on point. I'm not Asian, but this place felt like home to me. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and dine here again."}
{"text":"Brightly lit and energetic restaurant serving fantastic, authentic and mouth watering Thai cuisine, paired with a respectable wine list.  That pretty much sums up Lotus of Siam (LOS) for me. 

Since moving out to Las Vegas a few years ago, I have always heard about LOS, but have never ventured out to give them a try.  And when I finally went with a group of Meetup folks, the overall experience was positive.

LOS is a Thai restaurant that does truly deserves the many accolades that has been given by food critics, from the ranks of professionals to amateurs, from all around the world over the years.  The restaurant features a fairly large menu selection, some are common and easy to find on other menus, but more importantly it has entrées and specials that are not available in most other Thai restaurants in the US.  

Now, I am not saying every dish that is prepared and served from the kitchen is perfect and absolutely delicious, because it is not.  But out of the thirteen we ordered, there was only one I did not really cared for, most are good, and some are truly excellent.  Some items I thought was overpriced, while others I felt deserves the price charged.

Food highlights:
Prawn Ocha - Unique preparation of an otherwise common ingredient.  Delicious and highly recommended.  It is pricey, but definitely worth trying at least once. ($21.95)

#116 Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle
topped with, sauteed assorted seafood with fresh & dry chili,
Thai basil served on bed of green. ($12.95)

Desserts!  Their Fried Banana Roll is a little different from those served elsewhere, their Mango and Sticky Rice (the mango was surprisingly ripe and tasty for March, while the sticky rice was just A+), the Coconut Ice Cream was good.

Hits The Spot:
#130 Green Curry with Sliced Chicken. Nothing fancy, but is still good. ($9.95) 

#85  Spicy Catfish with Basil Leaves - Sautéed deep fried thin catfish slice without bone in fresh and dried chili and Thai basil leaves. ($13.95)

Dislikes:
#14 Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage) - not particularly interesting, and way too much lime for my taste.  Although others on Yelp, ChowHound, etc raves about it. So give it a try, and decide for yourself.

Service - Acceptable.  We had a large party of 11, and they did their best to provide decent level of service.  The kitchen was also able to space out the timing of serving the dishes, otherwise there will definitely not be any room to put everything we ordered on the two tables they put together to seat our group.

Recommended group size: Small parties of 1-2, 3-4, or 7or 8 (small 2 tops, 4 tops, or 2x 4 tops). Anything larger, you will just be squeezed into tables that should seat 8 comfortably. 

Make reservations in advance!  Especially if you have a large group.

Food: 3.5 - some hits and some misses. The noodles all seems to be good to great.
Service: 3 - probably provides better service for smaller and more manageable parties.
Ambiance: 4.5 - It is brightly lit, which I prefer, so I can see my food and how artfully it has been presented.
Price: 3 - Some items seems overpriced, while others deserved the markup.  Our party average $32/person (no wine), and we were able to try a lot of food.

If I can give it a 3.5 I would, because it is better than just \"A-OK\", but not really good enough for the \"Yay! I'm a fan\"."}
{"text":"Was in vegas for the weekend and with one night left, talked with my wife about nice places to go. I was thinking steakhouse, seafood/sushi, etc. Something expensive and fancy on the strip. She said a friend told her about a Thai restaurant(she loves thai and im starting to) that she HAS to go to. She called him to get the name, and we went to Lotus of Siam. Overall, absolutely phenominal. The duck in creamy curry(no clue what its actually called) was the best. Fried rice and garlic prawns great as well. Spent 40-50 on round trip cabs but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Three weeks ago we actually sent back our lab it was disgusting, the flavors were not there..just lime with cilantro???? Very bad experience, service sub par pad thai was bad ...we asked waiter what's up? He said new cook....ok but he can't cook...it was that bad..the plain steamed rice was good....pad prik khing with no flavor yuck
..."}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious! I ordered the crispy duck with chili flakes and mint. WOW is all I can say about that. They have other seasonings for the crispy duck as well, and I really want to try them all. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My only two complaints are that there was a very long wait just to get in to the restaurant and the portion size was soooo small compared to how expensive it was.  I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed about that.  But it was WORTH the wait, and I also really loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! Located in a sketchy, shady strip mall.  It is ALLLL HYPE!! I expected so much more WHAT A LET DOWN. They give small portions. It is not all that great. I would say one of the BLAH Thai places I have been too and I love Thai food. Should have went to the place my sis wanted to go to. SKIP IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Vegas has been 2 for 2 for me as far as venturing away from Buffets!

Lotus of Siam did not disappoint, the service was great and attentive.  We got our food FAST!! Seriously, probably within 10 minutes of ordering.

Our list of plates included : prawns, duck w/ panang sauce, sausage, chicken wings and drunken noodles... everything was so amazing! The prawn was so finger licking good that I can probably just eat the shells all day long!  The sausage was flavorful and the wings were crisp!!!  What stood out the most however, was the duck with panang sauce, that was perfection a definitely must try!!! TENDER, FLAVORFUL and full of character

I will definitely be back next time I'm here in Vegas!! :D"}
{"text":"Wow!  Khao Soi! Absolutely amazingly fresh and authentic Thai food.  Get the specials in the back.  This isn't your neighborhood Thai joint.  This is legit Bangkok back alley local cuisine."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally have tried this place out in Vegas. I've read so many great reviews about this place that I felt that I was ready to experience this myself. 

Okay, so you read the reviews about its location and how its in a strip mall and blah blah blah. For reals? Sometimes the best places to get authentic food is hole in the wall joints like this. Love it or hate it that's the truth. 

Went with a lot of recommendations on here and ordered from the Northern menu and was not disappointed at all. Definitely grubbin for the three of us. I guess it's hit or miss with reservations because our party of three lucked out and were seated immediately without reservations but 10 minutes later the wait was out the door.  Prolly not the best idea to test your luck.  Call and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Really really bomb Thai. Came here around be 7ish on a Friday night, only had to wait about ten min without a reservation. Only about a 7 dollar uber ride from the strip. We got the veggie egg rolls and another crispy rice appetizer- both delicious and for the main plates we got the sweet and sour chicken, garlic prawns, kung pao chicken, and a recommended beef dish from the waiter, which was really good. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas, it's nice to get off the strip for a bit! Oh yeah we also got the fried banana dish for dessert which was just okay."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand for a couple years and eating Thai food all over the country, I came to this restaurant with high expectations due to the yelp reviews. Here is my opinion of this place. The food quality is pretty basic and authentic. Tastes like a home cook meal - dishes here are a bit more salty, like food made in Thailand. Regarding taste and authenticity I would rate this restaurant as a 2.5*. The prices is over priced. Price/value is 2*. 

Here is what we had.

Hoh Mok Sea Bass (Hor Mok) - $29 - tastes authentic but lacks flavor. Needs to add some finely julienned kafir leaves - which I could not find present in my dish. This dish is normally cooked and served using a small clay pot. This restaurant cooks this dish inside a foil pouch. The top of portion of our Hor Mok, including the fish was somewhat dried (should have been more moist), while there is excess juice accumulated at the bottom of the foil pouch. (If I had known this, I could have tried to fix this by flipping the pouch for a while before flipping it back upright.... lol)

Garlic Prawns. $22 - I feel our shrimp was a bit too salty and over cooked, causing the shrimp to be dried up. The shrimp should not be deep fried for too long like they did at this restaurant. Once done properly you should get a juicy shrimp with a crispy coating on the outside. This dish is basically prepared in the same way as the Chinese salt and pepper pork chop.

Mango with sticky rice. the sticky rice was on the firmer side and not as tender and smooth tasting. Mango was fresh mango."}
{"text":"Great place! We ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, pad thai with shrimp, basil chicken and it was all very good! Dessert was fried banana, coconut ice cream. Everything was great including the service."}
{"text":"Please do me a favor. Press Ctrl+F. Now, in the box that comes up, type the word \"overrated\". Tell me how many reviewers find that this place is extremely hyped up, for a reason I can't understand. 

Just had to get that out. Now the food is good, on my only visit there I only had the opportunity to try the beef salad, chicken pad thai, basil beef and pad-ka-pow. They were decent, but the portions are a tad bit small for the prices. Restaurant is relatively small, and the service was above average. Overall, if I'm in the area, I'd definitely come back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here. Definitely, overrated. See for yourself."}
{"text":"After a long drive to Vegas, my friends and I were hungry for something fulfilling and reasonably price. Since most restaurants on the strip are priced with $$$, I suggested Lotus of Siam to my friends knowing that most dishes will not break the budget. 

Although most people stated that a reservation was a must, we took a chance on a Friday evening and was quoted a wait time of 1.5 hr. The good thing about Lotus is that you can leave your number with them and they will call when the table is ready. After 45 minutes of waiting, we were promptly seated and ordered the following items: Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodles w/ Crispy Duck, and Nam Prik Ong.

I highly recomment the Garlic Prawns and Nam Prik Ong as they were the biggest hit at our table."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin!!! Just a heads up, some of their food is a bit pricey, not all. For the amount, it's pretty good.

I came for the lobster. Okay, well, at least that's what I intended on ordering before I heard the price and the amount! 5 lbs??? OMG! Maybe when I bring a few extra mouths to feed it'll be worth it, but for hubby and I, it was just too much...considering we wanted to order more than one dish.

I will be back for this one day...
**Lobster-5lbs-$100**

So, instead we ended up ordering:

Golden Prawns=LOVED IT, WANT MORE, YOU MUST ORDER!!! HECK, ORDER 2!!! 
Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles=THIS WAS ANOTHER FAVE! YUMMY!! Duck over thick rice noodles.
Thai Beef Salad-Didn't really like. It was too saucy for me.
Hor Mok Sea Bass-Yeah, not a real fan of this either. No comment.

One thing I really hoped for was free refills on their thai tea. There's a couple of places where I live that offer unlimited refills (which keeps bringing me back). While the food is pretty good here, unlimited refills would be the cherry on my sundae.

Things to remember:
1. Make reservations (esp if you're coming in a large group)
2. The back of the restaurant faces the street. So you won't see the entrance until you drive into the parking lot.

{"text":"Amazing food everytime! Really authentic Thai food. Best I've ever had. The menu is large and that can be overwhelming, but everything I've tried is amazing.

Garlic prawns and the Crispy duck are can't miss. Truly special. Come and try it for yourself you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie pad thai and garlic shrimp. Next time tofu/veggie pad thai and bbq shrimp instead."}
{"text":"Was in town for a graduation, the wifey had been wanting to try this place since forever! We luckily got a reservation. What can I say, the hype is real here. Not really a big shrimp fan, but I definitely was tonight. You have to order the garlic prawns! We also ordered the pad thai, garlic prawns with drunken noodles, sea bass, the duck, fried rice. Everything we ordered everybody liked a lot. The problem for me was the for $30 each plate, servings are kind of small. We were all full, just maybe expected a little bit more. But overall 5 Stars because the service was awesome from the second we walked in, our waitress, all the workers that walked by. The restaurant itself was really nice too! We've been to many thai places in our hometown in LA, but Lotus of Siam is by far the nicest Thai restaurant. Overall great dinner. Would I come back? Probably not, but maybe if we were invited by friends because I'm used to (and prefer) to get more for my money"}
{"text":"A little pricey for thai food, but it is the best thai food I have ever had in north america. Panang fried duck was sooooo good, its making my mouth water just writing about it. The duck was fried to perfection and there was so much flavor in the curry. Also the sai oua (northern sausage homemade) was so flavorful, spicy, but surprisingly refreshing. Best thai food ever, will always go back when in vegas. So much more stuff to try."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on parts unknown and definitely wanted to stop by next time I was in Vegas. I really admit that it did not disappoint. We got there and the hour wait was worth it. Just grab a drink at their bar and check out all the celebrity photos on the walls. 

The food was amazing, the staff was beyond quick and courteous. They have a lot of thai staff there and they took care of us as if we were family. I wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Can't add much more to the many many reviews on yelp about this place.  A few tips: 1) the entrance to the restaurant is from the back/parking lot area, not the main street; 2) the drinks at the bar while you wait for your table, and yes, you will wait (we did even with a reservation) are not horribly priced.  No hard liquor; and 3) make a reservation.  We called on our way into Vegas for the next day, so don't be scared off by this fact.  Just call, take the late night reservation time, and enjoy the food. 

Started with fried wontons, which honestly were tasty but nothing new or interesting or astonishing.  Then, had the beef with peppercorn, which is a ton of little peppercorns on the vine (?) which surprised me; but this was delicious.  Never had something like this before!  Also, tasted the garlic prawns.  All the talk on yelp, so I'll leave that to the serious seafood eaters. 

Giant parking lot, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Also, lots of cabs hanging out in the case you want to take one over from the strip and just step outside to head back."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food all the time, have eaten at numerous Thai restaurants across the country and in Thailand and am of THAI/American ethnicity.  That being said, this place is really good.  To be fair I would probably say a 4.5, but there are somethings that could improve.   Definitely the best in LV that I've had, and I used to live here for part of my life.  I'm sure some people have had a bad experience for various reasons, but here's my take...

Good news:  Phad see ew, drunken noodles, and curry's are some of my favorite dishes.  Phad Thai is also good here (and I'm not even a big fan of that- we had fried tofu in ours- delicious!)  If you can handle the heat try the green papaya salad (som tom)-  It's a small serving but your mouth with be crying tears of joy and pain from all of the fire.  I wanted to try the beef salad but haven't had a chance yet.  I also love Thai deserts so Khao Neeo (sticky rice) with coconut and mangoes was good here (mangoes weren't super sweet, but weren't in season so not necessarily their fault).  

Bad news:  the area is sketchy, and there is really no way to make reservations (the email thing is useless), so show up before it opens if you have a large party to put your name on the list or be prepared to wait.  The portions are smaller, but everybody at our party was stuffed (party of 7) for only about $130 (no alcohol).  That's  deal for good food in my mind for Vegas.  So order tons of dishes and do what we do. . .share.  

Once your inside the service is good and the people are friendly.  

We usually make it a point to eat here when we are in town.

Arroy Mak Mak!  (very delicious)"}
{"text":"One of the Best Thai food spots I've ever been to. I will plan to go here every time I visit Vegas. A lot of items on the menu, plenty of veggie items, great flavors."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give this place a try, especially seeing what great reviews were said on yelp. We got there during the lunch hour, for a table of 8 we had to wait 45 minutes which was understandable. When we were waiting inside, we noticed the buffet option but opted to order from the menu since the lunch buffet looked basic. When the food arrived, we all agreed that the food was delicious but many other Thai restaurants down the street offer the same great taste for half the price and double the size. Food may be great but their service was horrendous. For a restaurant with such great reviews, I was surprised we had to wait 30 mins for water and made many, many attempts to gather a waiter's attention for our check. Our party left unsatisfied and made a quick stop at Mcdonalds because we were still hungry. Based on price, portion, and service...I wouldn't return or recommend this place which is why I give two stars."}
{"text":"WTF, I just notice I never review this place before.  Well, let me get started then!

This is one of must stop place in Vegas for me, and t should be your's too!

2 things that I always order here:

1. Tom Yum Ka - a little bite of sourness with a little bit of heat; a perfect balance of what a soup should be.  The chicken and mushroom inside also complements each other perfectly. It's a light soup, not heavy at all, so perfect for any day.

2. Garlic Shrimp - cannot not find it any other Thai restaurants I've been to. It's basically fried shrimp with their secret seasoning. The shells are also fried until their extremely crispy, so you can actually eat it!  You MUST try this!

3rd item always depends on my mood.  This time, it's chripy duck with drunken noodle. If you ever had pad see you, it tastes like that with lots of basil. The fried duck is crispy and moist, yummmoooo.

If you never had good Thai food before, this is the place to come. Oh, becareful the level of heat you asks for. If you can take spice, then there's nothing you need to worry about, but if you can, go 3 or lower!"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch time: the restaurant's outside appearance looked empty as we pulled into the parking lot, but it was a different atmosphere when you step foot inside. It was more lively, nice, and spacious, and we were greeted by friendly staff. There was no wait. 

Our overall experience was just average/good. We ordered the typical Thai dishes at medium spicy level: Pad Thai with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and Papaya salad. It was good, but nothing seemed to \"wow\" us. As more people showed up for the lunch hour, the place became more crowded. Sometimes, it was hard to grab the waiters' attention during our meal. 

Maybe we'll try other specialty dishes next time."}
{"text":"I'm only giving Lotus of Siam 5 stars because I can't give it 6 stars. Best Thai food I have ever had! 

Most Thai restaurants have really similar menu's but Lotus of Siam has unique, elevated dishes that put it above all the competition. We got there at 5:10pm (opens at 5:30pm) and there was already a line of people waiting outside. But we had no problem being seated because the restaurant's pretty large inside and we got in with the first wave. 

Dishes that WOW'ed us:
Drunken noodles with soft shell crab 
Crispy duck with panang curry
Garlic prawns
Pad Thai w/ chicken and shrimp

Service is excellent. Bookmark for your next Vegas getaway NOW!"}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD EVER.

My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and we stopped by here Friday night. Waited about an hour and got seated! 

We ordered pad Thai, soft shelled crab drunken noodle, beef satay, duck curry, and the pineapple fried rice.

Honestly all of it was delicious and the customer service was amazing despite how busy it was! 

Also it was my birthdays and they gave me this coconut ice cream which was like a sorbet? Not sure but it was so good and light. 

Def will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended in our tour book as the best of- off the beaten path and it did not disappoint!  It is located in a mostly Asian food shopping center.

The menu is extensive and every part of our order was excellent.  From the appetizers to the dessert, the best Thai food we have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is an upscale, clean, and well managed place tucked away in the commercial center.  It's definitely worth checking out.  They pack the tables in and the decor looks like a classic chinese restaurant with big rooms full of tables with multi-purpose room lighting, but still a great spot to go, especially if you're just visiting or want to sample a very popular spot."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like it's all that on the outside but as soon as you walk in there restrauant is huge. You don't see any staff sitting around everyone is doing something I swear we had line 4 servers. Service was wonderful and so was all the food. I would defiantly recommend this place for all occasions"}
{"text":"Way upgrade from Sahara location. Feels like we're at a super fancy restaurant. Love the waiting area too! Comfy while you wait"}
{"text":"Gave this spot a few chances, I have not been wow-ed by the food here. Every thing we ordered was lacking some flavor. My mom ordered her food very spicy, came out with no spice...my dish was simply bland, and the portions didn't really match the prices. 
Service was swift, but the food isn't as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. I've had better Thai for a better price and more appropriate portion size."}
{"text":"If you live in the area and are able to drop in regularly, good for you. But for those of us who get to Vegas a couple times a year, the visit to Lotus of Siam must be meticulously planned.

* Time your attack. If you're in town for a major convention you have to get there VERY early or else make reservations well in advance for a large party, otherwise you will wait 90 minutes or more. (If you want to call ahead, note that when the restaurant is closed, up till 5 pm, they simply don't answer the phone.)

* Be sure your hotel room has microwave and refrigerator. That way you can order with abandon and know you can take the leftovers to enjoy another day.

* When they ask you \"how spicy\" tell them no more than a 5 or 6 or you truly will have your taste buds blown away. I say this as someone who regularly puts Tabasco in many dishes at home.

* Take time to study the enormous menu (grab one while you're waiting for a table}, or just throw yourself on the mercy of your server after telling them you want the northern/Issan dishes. You will note that many of the salad-y dishes have common ingredients of chili and lime and red onion. Don't get more than one or two of these unless you are at a big table sharing because the flavors will be too close together and the chilis will blow you away for the rest of the meal. Likewise, the finely chopped Issan dishes are complex and subtle but they are close enough in flavor that they should be enjoyed on subsequent visits, not on the same night. (Unless, again, you are a large party and can order a few of these to share and sample.)

* If you're there at lunch, resist the temptation to just get the inexpensive buffet. It's totally different stuff.

* Pace yourself and use discipline when tasting among the different dishes. The food arrives when it is ready; the kitchen seems to have no interest in giving you a soup first, then a salad, then a more substantial dish with rice. If you want your meal organized this way, you'll have to do it yourself. 

If I am by myself, here's the strategy I will use for my next several visits as I order my way through the menu.

* Start with a soup. Most of these are Thai standards but the kitchen is so good with different ingredients I would expect them to be great renditions. Anyway, you can't go wrong with the Northern Style Thom Kha Gai (item M on the Northern menu): amazingly light, fresh tasting, spicy and redolent of lemon grass, a perfect food I could gulp by the quart.

* Now a northern/Issan specialty--or two or more, if you're sharing. Have this before the salad because the flavors are subtle. Some favorites are Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice with very finely chopped sausage) and Kang Hung Lay (garlicky northern pork stew, a smallish portion). This last visit I had #61 Hok Mok Plar, catfish \"in a hok mok chili sauce\" which is like a curry, but eggy--strange and wonderful.

* Now a Thai salad, which you've resisted or just nibbled at because of the chili factor. On your first visit, the choice is simple: crispy catfish salad. It's like a good green papaya salad, but with amazing bits of fish. My last visit I had #14 Larb Koong and was very pleased. Catfish again, but finely chopped, marinated and folded into crispy rice.

* At this point you have spent a lot of money and you probably aren't particularly full, so I would pad my menu with a curry served with rice. My last visit I tried Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow (#G on the northern menu, rice vermicelli curry) and was disappointed--oily and not a lot of flavor. Next time I'll try a standard Panang or red or green curry which will also bring my per-item average cost down. 

* Dessert? I am generally too sated when I get to this point but if you want dessert the mango with sticky rice is a delightful and popular choice.


* Don't be shy about asking the kitchen to pack the uneaten bits to go--they expect this. They get a lot of takeout orders from people who are taking the food on the plane, or get frustrated at a 2 hour wait for a table. And it's your food--you've paid for it!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah, I think I've finally been converted to a Lotus of Siam fan. I have been to Lotus of Siam on two previous occasions and have not been impressed. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe I ordered the right things on my previous visits, so I take ownership of that. 

I came here this evening with my fella. It was his first visit and he was excited to finally try the famous Lotus of Siam. He's a big fan of Komol, so he wasn't sure Lotus could top it. We arrived around 8:45 and there was an estimated 30 minute wait. We were seated in less than 20 minutes, thankfully. Once seated, our server was extremely attentive and friendly from start to finish. There wasn't a moment that our drinks went unfilled. He checked back on us often, so that helped give them an extra star as well. 

On to the food. Having had two previous less than spectacular visits here, I was on a mission to find the right food to eat here. I had heard so many great things about the nam kao tod, so that was a must try. We also ordered the drunken noodle with prawns and the choo chee duck. The food came out quickly and the food portions were incredibly generous. The spice level was no joke. I had heard they were famous for spice, so we ordered a 5 to stay on the safe side. We typically order a 7 or 8 at other restaurants, but we were very glad that we erred on the side of caution. The flavors were amazing. The name kao tod had the perfect flavors and texture. The drunken noodle were also terrific. So was the choo chee. The duck was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce. 

Lotus definitely more than converted me to a devotee this evening. It'll definitely become a regular on the Thai rotation again, I'm excited to say. I already have a list of other delightful delectables I'm looking forward to trying on my next trip."}
{"text":"the hype is real! haha...after years of hearing about this place, i finally got to try it during a recent trip to vegas. we stopped here for lunch on the way into town on Friday around 1pm and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a party of 3 so not bad at all. the menu is pretty overwhelming since there is so much to selection and even after scouring yelp reviews, we still didnt know what to get haha...so we left the choice up to our trusty server. we asked him for the most popular dishes and without hesitation had his top 3 choices for us (but since we were hungry, we asked for his top 4 picks instead haha).

we ordered:
garlic prawns - so much great garlic flavor, freshly fried but with a light better. such a nice crisp to it and you cant even tell that it's fried with the shell still on it
drunken noodles with sea bass - my favorite dish of my lunch! the sea bass was fried with a light batter that almost reminded me of like an agedashi tofu dish. it was so delicious though and paired with the fat noodles - the best!
beef dish w/peanut sauce - cant remember the name of this dish but it was strips of steak with mixed veggies over this amazing peanut sauce that we were pretty much just dipping in everything haha
crispy duck in red curry - another amazing dish. luckily we had ordered this only at a spice level 2 out of 10 and it had the right amount of kick to it where we could still appreciate the flavor of the curry without having our mouths on fire haha.
fried banana for dessert - even this simple dessert at most restaurants came out way above average haha. banana was fried in more of an egg roll wrapper and freshly fried with a great crisp/crunch to it. (seriously whatever they're doing here to fry their food is amazing haha)

totally amazing lunch and was a great start to our weekend in vegas! the restaurant is pretty pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is our special occasion restaurant even though it's not too fancy. It's kind of in the ghetto, but it is so worth the drive.  Everything I have ever had here is fantastic.  Not sure what it's called on the menu, but the crispy prawns with their heads are super yummy... and the drunken noodles, nam kao tod, tom kah kai soup, coconut ice cream which seems like it is home made, sticky rice dessert, etc. are all unbelievable.  Oh I can't forget and my new fave green papaya salad...so nummy!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting family. I had heard it was amazing and it held up to the hype.

I ordered the northern red curry with tofu and my cousin got one of the other curries. We shared the egg rolls and fried banana dessert. Everything I had was delicious and I want to come back and try their other items. Although the menu doesn't look like it has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options the majority of dishes where you pick a meat you can sub tofu and add vegetables. Also they have a great selection of wines. Often Asian food can be overly greasy this restaurant uses good ingredients and is not overly greasy. 

We both wanted sticky rice and ordered it but then when they brought out food they didn't bring it we told the guy that and after 5 Minutes our server came over to check on us and we told her we hadn't gotten it. She went to check and found out there were out of it. This was disappointing but when we asked for another order of regular rice she didn't charge us. Very good service, they are really nice and welcoming. 

We waited 1 hour 10 Minutes after being told it would be an hour wait. It's super busy here I would recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to while I am in Vegas. The quality of the food is amazing...
Definitely recommend the panang duck, and the garlic prawns...

The only reason I don't give this restaurant a 5/5 is because I feel the pricing is a little bit too much for the portions that you are getting."}
{"text":"Had a vacation in Vegas and then decided to visit this place since they served Northern Thai Food together.

I had ordered Khaw-Soi (egg noodles in red curry sauce) and Keang hang lay(stewed pork in sweet sauce). Those are so delicious and the taste are originally northern style and somehow it flashes back to the culture and environment of Chiangmai, Northern Part of Thailand.

The location is good, beautiful interior decoration, clean and comfortable restrooms and free parking lots are provided.

However, the dinner time is so busy and to make an advanced reservation is recommended especially for party of 4 or upper."}
{"text":"We had the garlic prawns, they were insane, and the drunken noodle with Sea Bass will force me to come back plus we had the Panang Curry with chicken and it was excellent. No wonder they have 48,000 Facebook check in's and thousands of reviews along with a guaranteed 45 minute wait time."}
{"text":"Wow, people are really hard on this restaurant as if they were authentic thai chefs themselves...just kidding! I've recently become a really big fan of thai food, although I've been a HUGE fan of pad thai for quite some years now.

After seeing that the Lotus of Siam was on the food network, I knew I had to give it a try. I've been there about 4 or 5 times now and have been satisfied every time.  I mean, it wasn't THE best thai I've had, but I can see why everyone's raving about it.  Next time, try to be a little brave and order a little something from each category and try it out...you won't be sorry.

I started talking to the waitress and she said that the reason why the food was so fresh is that they make a trip to LA TWICE a week to get fresh ingredients for their dishes. TWICE A WEEK! If that's not passion, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Thai Restaurants I have been to. The seafood drunken noodle and the larb are a must try, though the BBQ pork is also a must have.
I give it 4 stars, minus 1 for the location and the noise factor."}
{"text":"Like many others have written before it really looks sad from the outside but dont let it fool you. 
Also the interior feels a bit like the school eatery and its not avery cosy place for a date but if you want great thai food.......This is the place! 

I started with the thai style beef jerky. It was juicy and great in taste but a bit hard to rip 
apart both with the knife and teeth. I was kind of sore in my jaw after the appetizer like ive had a bunch of jaw breakers but it was so tasty i couldnt stop eating.......... 

I couldnt decide on what entrée to choose so i took chicken with cashewnuts and oystersauce and the beef panang. The waiter asked how spicy we wanted the food from a 1-10 rating..... 
Since we all love really spicy food like thai and indian and ive spent several weeks in thailand i took 7 on my dishes. BAD CHOICE.......it was so spicy i almsot fell of my chair and by far the most spicy food i have ever had. We sat in silent the four of us but in the end ate ALL of the food. 

That was how good it was. The flavours came through even though the spicyness and the beef and chicken was very fresh. We drank ALOT of water with the food but wouldnt hesitate eating here again. Would not go over 5 next time when it comes to the level of spicyness. 

Prices are good with appetizers from 6-9 and most entrées around 10-12 $."}
{"text":"I don't know what alllll the hype is about. There were 2 dozen people lined up outside waiting for it to open at 5pm, really?!?!? 

Service - average. Not bad, not good.  (They brought out a dessert for my bff bday but didn't have a candle.) 

-Pad thai - very good. No better than Archie's though. 

- Fried soft shell crab curry (?) crab was mushy in the fried shell after 10 minutes. 
 
- chicken skewers - average. 

-papaya salad - tasty but not worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Lotus sits in a ghetto Korean plaza away from the Strip.
And so I was a bit concerned until I saw the line of customers forming by the door before the restaurant even opened.

The interior is much larger than you'd expect and much nicer than you would hope.

The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. Customers are seated quickly and orders are completed quickly in what I'd imagine to be a gigantic kitchen. Staff is also attentive and prompt.

I suggest 
Pad Thai - good
#58 - don't remember what it was, just eat it with the lettuce it sits on
Papaya Salad - fresh and strong

I ordered the crispy garlic prawn as many yelpers suggested and was not impressed..

4 stars because of high prices and below average quantity; will still return."}
{"text":"I had to try this restaurant because everyone and their mama raved about it.  And now I see why.  Lotus of Siam may not be considered \"authentic\" Thai food, but I don't care- it is delicious! I have eaten here twice and both times I didn't see any patrons of Thai heritage.  

Nonetheless, the deep fried garlic prawns are reason enough to try this restaurant. And I'll go back for the perfectly deep fried catfish with basil in a heartbeat. I'll admit, the Pad Thai was a bit sweet for my liking, but my 2 year old daughter ate every morsel.   The Papaya salad was also way too spicy for me, but it didn't stop us from eating the entire dish.  

The service is fantastic. And if you get here before the dinner rush, around 6ish, there should be plenty of open tables. Otherwise, make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait a long time."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of thai food in Dallas, and sucks for me because this was better than anything I can get at home. 

Their spicy basil sauce (on whatever meat you choose) is delicious. I had it on three dishes: the catfish, with minced chicken on the pad kee mao, and later on a whole fried red snapper. Sauce is right on the money.

The green papaya salad is my favorite I've ever had. Crisp, well marinated: it bursts with flavor. Make sure you get it spicy though. We got it medium, and one time it was fairly hot, the next time it was not hot enough. I would err on the side of too spicy next time. Nice ripe tomato bits in it also.

I liked the Crisp Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage, but dining partner wasn't impressed. I thought it had interesting texture to the rice with a concentrated flavor, though the sausage looked more like ham.

We also tried the Northern Larb...also a flavor concentration and quite good. It has minced pieces of pork and spices: very tasty but a little unusual.

Oh, Pad Woon Sen with shrimp was wonderful but it's hard to mess that up.

Only disappointment for me was the Khao Soi (yellow curry with rice noodles)...it was OK, but didn't stand out among others I've had.

Definitely finish the meal with the coconut ice cream. Home-made, rich, luxurious, perfect slightly melted temperature, small frozen bits of coconut embedded. This actually is what drew us back to LOS for a 2nd day in a row. 

So although I'm a bit Las Vegas-ed out right now, LOS may lure me back sooner than I plan."}
{"text":"Of course, reading all the other reviews, this one will be similar. Lotus of Siam is amazing. For an appetizer, we had No. 14, some sort of fried rice with lime, cilantro, and ginger. Oh so delicious. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass in Ginger. The fish was PERFECT. The fish was flaky and buttery and light and and and, just so wonderful. 

My boyfriend ordered the drunken noodle prawns. Also very delicious. We both preferred the sea bass tho. 

The level of spicyness was not as hot as we heard it to be. A level 5 spicy was barely hot for us, but that could be our tolerance. We were ok with it not being too spicy. 

My only complaint is it takes a long time to get through to someone on the phone to make reservations."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Zillions of pictures of \"famous\" patrons. Best servers in town. Food tasted fresh and delicious. Can't wait to come back for another dining experience."}
{"text":"My experience here did not live up to the hype.  I ordered the famous fried garlic shrimp everyone says is a must and the duck with curry sauce.  The shrimp/prawns were very fresh but I have eaten this dish at many Chinese restaurants in Philadelphia and did not find this to be particularly unique.  It is a heavy dish since its deep fried and I am glad I shared it with my wife.

As for the duck, it was over cooked and the curry sauce tasted too creamy/milky to me.  Overall a decent dish, but again, nothing special as far as I am concerned.

Maybe if someone is coming into town from a small city that does not have a decent Asian restaurant selection, this place would be considered amazing.  For me it fell a little short."}
{"text":"My wife being Thai and from Northern Thailand ;  Lotus of Siam had a lot to conquer in our opinion.  It did not disappoint and it lived up to its reputation! We had reservations at opening bell 5:30 Friday and there was already a line of people waiting to get in .  We were promptly seated when the door opened and greeted right away with beverage service . I couldn't believe it when l saw Thailand's Leo beer on the menu . Singha and Chang is everywhere including the stores but you can't find Leo nowhere . It was a no brainer what l wanted to drink . We ordered the signature item fried garlic pepper prawns as a appetizer,  and they were outstanding! You eat the shell and all ! So flavorful. It's a must order ! The next 2 dishes to arrive were the Rad Na with beef and the Pakee Mao Seafood. The wide noodles, tender beef ,broccoli and gravy were outstanding. So much flavor , the gravy could go on anything ! The Seafood dish was vibrant and light , the freshness of the dish holding the reputation of the restaurant.  We will be back . What a great place ! It's no surprise the top chefs in the world come here when they visit Las Vegas . The proof is on the wall !"}
{"text":"We odes takeout from this place,  and it was pretty good,  though some of the dishes seemed a little overcooked. I'd like to go back there sometime to eat in the restaurant and see if the food improves at all.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant based on the selection, speedy prep."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place is so amazing.  Everything I've tried is fantastic.  Like spicy?  Ask for #11.  And a fire extinguisher for your tongue."}
{"text":"I kept hearing from multiple sources how great Lotus of Siam was, so I immediately bookmarked it, but after many failed attempts while in Vegas I was beginning to feel that I would never get to check it out. As I was beginning to forget about LoS, I was reminded and managed to wake up in time to come an hour before closing. There was no wait that all my friends complained about. Sweet!

Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off strip. Don't let the area scare you away, because you'll have a enjoyable meal. Nothing like a little bit of anxiety to stir up an appetite. Based on the looks of it, you wouldn't have guessed that it won a bunch of recognitions and popped up on shows and magazines.

1) Pad See Ew is always a safe and solid option. I always have to order it when I eat Thai.
2) Green Curry - I haven't had a bad experience with Thai curry, *Knock on wood* It was savory and creamy.
3) Crispy Rice - I didn't expect the crispy rice to be limy. I personally like the limy flavor, so I personally enjoyed it.
4) Tom Yum Soup was good. It didn't particularly stand out from all the other ones I've tried. Other than the price tag.

Service: Decent. Nothing special.

Overall: Good food. The taste was on the better side, but the portions were lower while the price was higher than all the Thai restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Do not be put off by the location of this place, it is a hidden jewel. I have eaten Thai food in many different cities but I have to say this place tops then all. I had Koy Soy, basically steak tartar, and it was awesome. 
I do suggest reservations, this place gets crowded. And fair warning, they only hold the reservation for 10 mins past your time. My group of 8 were 15 mins late and we ended up waiting 20 mins or so for tables...but it was well worth it.
Next time I am in Vegas for CES I will eat here again."}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to try this restaurant because we saw it at an episode of the \"best thing I ever ate\" at the Food Network channel. There was a wait with people lining up. In about 20 minutes we were seated. I don't understand--What is all the hype about this restaurant? The food is nothing to rave about! The bbq chicken- ok- Ive had better ones! ; chow mein -alright; pork larb- disgusting! The only salvation was the Nam Prik Ong which is really delicious. The servings are not very generous. The prices appear cheap but don't be fooled for you get very little for what you pay. The staff are very nice and friendly, which is about the best I can say about this restaurant. All the following on this Thai restaurant  situated off the Strip did not live up to my expectations! Sorry."}
{"text":"Absolutely marvelous.  We ate here twice during our week in Las Vegas.  Food is superb and the service can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Cheapest good, low key, home/grandma cook Asian buffet in Vegas! Could not say anything else since I didn't try any other dishes but would be back when i visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and good. Price is similar to other Thai Restaurants. On a few items they are more expensive. Portions are small."}
{"text":"Oh so tasty.  Ordered the pad thai, garlic prawns, and pork belly with broccoli.  All solid.  Garlic prawns were the star, pad thai a close second, and crispy pork belly not far behind.  

Heard this spot usually has a very long wait (for good reason), so we came here for a late lunch on a Friday.  There was no wait, great service, even better food. I will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Even after the endless hype from my friends, this place still delivered! It's located in such a random plaza and you would never expect the food here to be any better than other Thai restaurants. Oh, but it is.

We made reservations a month prior for dinner on Saturday. It was never NOT packed. There was always at least 20 people waiting for a table.

We ordered some house favorites:
-Roasted duck curry
-Drunken noodles sea bass
-Drunken noodles chicken
-Kana Moo Krob (Stir-fried Chinese broccoli and crispy pork belly slices with oysterflavored sauce)
-Spicy catfish (Sautéed, deep fried thin catfish slices (deboned), in fresh and dried chilis and Thai basil leaves)

Everything was superb. It takes the cake for Thai food here!"}
{"text":"In a city where food spots must compete with the best of the best, a Thai place with thousands of reviews and 4-5 stars says a lot.  The restaurant is pretty large, with pictures of celebrities who've eaten there, covering the walls from top to bottom.  

The restaurant has speedy service, prices a little on the high end for some dishes, but money well spent.  Lotus of Siam offered some of the best, quality Thai food I've ever had, an experience that will get me to come back in the future.

We ordered the 
- garlic shrimp (skin like potato chips, fried perfectly it buttery batter; $27, but a most order): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EmtQ-VHVShfszx-JszgebQ&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ
- crying tiger, charbroiled beef with hot sauce and sticky rice (nicely marinated, tender charbroiled beef that goes well with sticky rice; careful with that hot sauce if you're driving home the next day - $17 dish): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PdqT3DYEP3Au93n5zzShsg&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ
- Tom Yum soup (spicy!): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xej3SJkCQu8Sh5K65E6eXg&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ
- Coconut ice cream; a must!: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OjIQUqcaDDYGh8b8ZnF0Mw&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ

The entire meal was about $70 for 2 people.  While we could have eaten for less at one of Vegas many buffets and restaurants, I'm happy we got to experience this spot and I'm sure we'll be back for more in the future."}
{"text":"The negative, it's always crowded, but I guess it's crowded for good reason. (I suggest making a reservation online in advance.) I was sad after the accident at the old location, but when I arrived at the new location, I figured it was a blessing in disguise. The new location looked fresh and had a lot more space.

While the service we received was not the absolute best (probably because we were in a corner), it was pretty good and ultimately, we had some good quality food that was also plated well. I was also happy with the lighting for photos. 

As always, I would suggest the garlic prawns, as while it's a little pricy when you first look at it on the menu, the prawns are a perfect crispiness and who would have thought that the shells would be the best part. I would not get it as your main meal, as personally, the flavor is best for an appetizer to share, but others might beg to differ.

I love Tom Yum Noodle, so that was my dish of choice, but there are a lot of great options for someone who loves Thai food or even for a first timer, there are some more basic items to try like Phat Si-oi (Pad See Ew). Just remember the spiciness level of Thai food! They offer a 1-10!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a let down. It's kind of out of the way but based on the reviews and what I had heard, we made a trip for lunch. It wasn't busy and the server was friendly. We tried the famous crispy duck panang and drunken noodle. The duck was decent but nothing amazing...way overhyped. I found the sauce to be too thin and the portion was small for the price. Both portions were small, the bill was way too high for lunch, and I have had better drunken noodle at multiple places in CT. This place is fine but definitely not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place was incredible, and totally lived up to the hype. It is a distance from the center of things, but well worth the trip. Be careful with the heat of things--what is mild to you may not be so much in their kitchen!
  The place was spotless, the staff super-friendly, and Chef Saipin even took a picture with us. 
  If you are feeling extra-adventurous, order from the back of the menu, for some of their Northern dishes."}
