{"text":"I had a brunch here. It was actually very good. Very tasty and very well presented. 

My only concern was that the portion was small. But it was well prepared. 

I would be disappointed for them to close. As they don't seem to have so many  clients. The thing is for a brunch it is a bit pricy and people tend to just like the exact same things over and over again. 

Laurier East is more of a residential area. So perhaps the restaurant needs to adapt to what people around want ? Perhaps reduce the prices a bit or try to find a way to connect with the neighbourhood. 

The decoration  is very simple and Scandinavian looking which is a plus. But adding some colour would be nice. It is all black and white for now. Make the place a little bit more cosy as we go there to eat :). 

I give five stars for the quality of the food and the quality of the coffee. Also the waiter was actually quite nice and helpful. Even when I teased him for a grammar error (in French) in the menu. 

Would love to see this restaurant do well as the Chef seems to be quite talented."}
{"text":"Superbe resto, tout est délicieux, oeufs béné, bacon, café, meringue aux fruits de la passion, j'ai bien hâte d'essayer le menu de soir!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  We loved everything we ordered for brunch.  Each dish was done to perfection.  The bacon was probably the best we have ever had.  The water was really nice and very friendly and tried his absolute best to translate and explained the menu.  We loved the food and the service. 
We will need to try dinner when we go to Montreal the next time.
The price is very reasonable for the quality of food we got.  There were 4 of us and we each said our dish we ordered was the best.  Loved it."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday brunch and were not disappointed. This is real, beautiful, attentive, inventive cuisine. Even though they actually strive to keep everything straightforward, their eggs Benedict look and taste atypical, in a very good way--same goes for everything on the menu. 

At 15$ the price is really fair. Coffee's not included. 

The decor has been slightly improved over Pyrus, the previous owner, which was already clean and elegant. Noise level is very much under control compared to so many horrendously noisy brunch places in Montreal.

We'll have to come back for the full evening restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Two brunch selections were vegetarian. One was an omelette but I chose the \"monkey bread,\" which was two huge pieces of slightly toasted, slightly sweet bread over chocolate ganache and berries. For me the proportions were off: too much dry bread and not enough moisture. It needed to be smaller and richer, with some some syrup or egg to make it not so dry. I came away remembering mostly bread. They didn't have soy milk so I got a regular latte instead. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the space is lovely."}
{"text":"Dear Plateau residents, 
You should be beating a path to the door of this fine establishment!

I had the best brunch of Little Laurier here, and that's saying something since the whole street (including side streets) is packed with brunch spots (including some of my favourites). Amongst the brunch bustle of Petit Laurier is this one restaurant that doesn't seem to get much traffic, and I can't imagine why other than that it's that kind of situation where if you don't see anyone in there through the windows, you don't go in because god forbid you should be the only one in there. I went in because I was *not* feeling the over-crowded vibe of some of the other brunch stops, and guess what happened? My hangry partner and I sat in the sunny window seat, and when our meals were brought to the table, they looked so amazing and we looked so obviously excited and content all at the same time, that people walking past took one peek through the window and began to flood in through the front door. 

The magical waffles, arranged in a waffle sculpture with white chocolate balls and a passion fruit cream, were so perfect that NO syrup was required. They were moist, just the right sweetness and beautiful to eat. My eggs benedict with smoked salmon was equally artfully done, brought out in double like twin treats on a big plate. The eggs were exactly as they should be, plus I had a side of thin, crispy toast perfect for dipping into the yolks. I'm pretty sure the English muffins were made in-house - they were cornmeal and sweet, and I scarfed them down like a hound. It was almost a shame to rip into such a beautifully presented meal. 

OH, before I forget to mention, the coffee: they have no regular drip coffee, so shucks, you're just going to have to settle for a perfect espresso-based cup. They had no soy milk or other milk alternative, so heads up if you watch lactose intake. I didn't mind. Our server was nice about it, in a kind of tough-luck-but-this-is-how-we-do-it unapologetic kind of way - I can respect that! I think the chef here takes a great deal of pride in the restaurant's offerings. 

So, I say, don't be shy: get your brunch butt in here for a sit down. Happy times ahead."}
{"text":"Howdy!

A surprisingly delicious and enjoyable dinner after the ballet. We called to let them know that we were going to be late, and as a consequence were not only able to find parking right in front of the door, but have a choice of tables.

As Herve noted, the place is awesome in handling sound. Whoever the architect was, they definitely know how to make sound waves bounce around so you can hear you dinner companion, but not the other folk in the restaurant.

They have a tiny, but spectacular wine list. I imagine that it changes often. However I would not hesitate to order any wine that they offered. We had a Prosecco, a white Portugues Douro and a Spainsh white wine and all were delicious.

As for the food, it was delicious as well. (Given my  rating would you expect anything less?) I had the veal, she had the fish for our mains. I had the pate en croute and she had the leeks to start.

I would guess that the menu for the food changes even more often then the wine list. Which in my book is a good thing, as it means that the chef (Julien Joré) is probably deciding what to make, based on what tastes delicious, rather than what he can always get.

So unless you're reading this on the night that I wrote it, I would imagine that your choice of what to eat will be very different - hence my not going into any serious detail.

We shared a pistachio/grapefruit desert that was almost better than the savory dishes we ordered.

If I had any complaint (and I don't) it would be that our main courses were plated very similarly. Almost as if mom had wanted to dress both kids the same way, if you get my drift.

I'd also suggest (nicely) that they might want to get a slightly larger selection of digestifs.

Unfortunately, I can't comment on price, as I was treated. But given the reaction of my dining companion when presented with the bill, it wasn't outrageous. But it wasn't $10/person either."}
{"text":"Très bon resto, tout était excellent. La présentation des plats est superbe. Par contre, il y avait peu de clients dans le resto. Allez-y, ça vaut la peine :)"}
{"text":"J'en donnerais facilement 4 si je me limitais au service exemplaire et à une cuisine raffinée, délicate, recherchée et succulente.

Mais malheureusement, samedi soir à 19h30  , on était la seule table, à part un ti couple perdu dans un coin.  Mal décoré, cave a vin vide, le cook qui passe l'aspirateur à 21h30...bref mettons que l'ambiance est plus joyeuse au crématorium.  

Pour un samedi soir, la quantité d'huitre au total?  12!!  Pas beaucoup de réservations.

Si ça vous intéresse, dépêchez vous d'y aller avant que ça ferme.  Malheureusement, le manque de stationnement et la crise économique vont avoir raison de ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Ma première visite au Cirkus me laisse sur une impression mitigée. Nous sommes venus ici pour le brunch dominical et notre groupe a été déçu sur plusieurs points. Dans l'ensemble, les plats offerts ici sont d'une excellente qualité. Rien à redire sur ce point. Mais les portions sont petites. Toutes petites. Pour ma part, j'ai eu droit à deux ufs cuits durs, deux tranches de bacon, quelques légumes grillés sur un fond en sauce (voir ma photo). Oui, c'était délicieux (la seule raison pour laquelle je donne 3 étoiles), mais après quelques bouchées, mon assiette était déjà vide. Pour tout dire, j'avais encore faim après avoir terminé. Cette sensation de ne pas être rassasié était aussi partagée autour de moi, ce qui a créé un malaise évident lorsque le serveur est venu prendre nos impressions à la fin du repas. 

Le montant nettement exagéré de la facture est un autre point négatif. Ma conjointe et moi avons déboursé 55 $ pour deux assiettes, deux cafés et un dessert partagé. Aucun des couples à table ne s'en est sorti en dessous de 50 $. Pour un brunch, c'est cher. 

Pour ajouter au malaise, une inscription au bas de la facture nous invitait à offrir entre 18 à 20 % de pourboire au serveur. Merci de la suggestion, mais je suis capable de juger moi-même lorsqu'un service supérieur vaut plus que l'habituel (et très respectable) 15 %.  

Parlant facture, vous en voulez une bonne? Les patates rissolées ne sont pas comprises avec les déjeuners. Il faut donc débourser un supplément de 6 $ pour en avoir avec votre assiette. Non, ce n'est pas une erreur de typo. 6 $ pour un misérable bol de patates.

Pour finir... Lorsque je suis entré au Cirkus ce matin-là, le resto était à peu près vide. J'ai alors demandé à la serveuse si elle avait de la place pour un groupe de 7 personnes, ce qui me semblait une évidence en raison des nombreuses tables vacantes. Et bien, j'ai eu droit à un regard prétentieux accompagné d'un commentaire tout à fait inutile; \" Attendez, je dois d'abord vérifier. \" Vous voyez le genre?

En Bref : Cuisine de qualité. Portions réduites. Prix exorbitant. Service correct. Le Cirkus est peut-être un très bon resto pour un souper romantique, mais pour le brunch, je ne recommande pas."}
{"text":"Samedi soir, St Valentin. Monsieur a trouvé l'adresse, j'en suis ravie j'avais très envie d'essayer le Cirkus depuis un moment.

Première impression plutôt bonne : le lieu est chic et épuré, des ombres chinoises rappelant l'univers du cirque ornent les murs, chouette clin d'il. La cave à vin est apparente (et que de choix !) et la cuisine semi-ouverte nous permet d'avoir une idée des coulisses. Hâte aux plats !

Menu de st Valentin : amuse-bouche, entrée et plat au choix, pré-dessert et dessert à partager. J'aime le concept. 
Bien qu'un peu déçue de mon entrée, je mets ça sur le compte des goûts propres à chacun, car la présentation est superbe et le mélange des saveurs intéressant. Ma pièce de cerf est délicieuse, pour ceux qui aiment la viande, mais un choix végétarien était disponible et avait l'air succulent !

Le service est impeccable et j'apprécie particulièrement d'être conseillée sur le vin : trop rare malheureusement ici. Résultat ? Un vin rouge assez corsé pour accompagner ma viande, un sans faute.

Je recommande chaudement cette place pour son ambiance et sa cuisine contemporaine, et pour sa carte des vins."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place such a low rating when the chef so clearly has technique and vision, but the food was woefully underseasoned and the waitstaff mostly absent, leaving me to muddle through my meal wishing I could have some salt.

The positives:
The onion bread, which replaces the standard English muffin in the Benedict dishes was the star of the show here - it was the one item that tasted perfect all on its own. 
The bathroom was clean and pretty.

The décor is a bit lame... It seems like they started but haven't finished... There are the makings of a gallery wall, and a few very discrete sconces that are circus themed. The concept does not feel well thought out or fluid. Get an interior decorator in here stat!"}
{"text":"A quiet small place for dinner on Laurier Est. It's tapas style but with less than 10 options on the menu. So I tell myself don't dare paying over $9 for a simple carrot soup when you're 3min walk from home :P . The food was great but maybe not interesting enough for the price & location (fierce competition in this area). Brunch seems to be more reasonable so may be I will give it another try."}
