Leaving the International Centre yesterday in search of a late lunch I stumbled upon Wild Ginger literally a stones throw away. It was amazing that such a visible spot had yet to end up on Yelp, and while my sushi aficionado companion from Vancouver entered with skeptical outlook citing that I was \"brave\" the quality of the food and the look and feel of this spot were impressive. 

While the menu states \"grand opening\" Wild Ginger has actually been around for about 2 years according to the staff. I was thoroughly impressed with the asian fusion style of this place. A full sushi bar sits to the rear while a giant Teppanyaki table was set up on your left just past the bar when you walk in.

These features were joined by several other styles of Asian cuisine on the menu: Sushi, Bento Boxes, Hakka style Chinese, Teppanyaki, and Thai. Certainly something for everyones taste, however today we were both feeling a lighter lunch so sushi was the direction we were heading.

CH ordered the hand roll set which came with 5 different kinds of hand rolls (all huge), so much for a light lunch as she was stuffed by the time she came to her last one. That being said this sushi expert was impressed with this spot.

For myself I ordered the Sushi and sashimi regular plate for $15.99. It came with 6 pieces of sashimi, a California roll and an assortment of sushi. The quality and the freshness of the fish was top notch as far as Ontario sushi spots go, and I was pleased with the portion sizes as well. I was really stuffed by the end of my meal. 

BONUS POINTS: Presntation! The plates were so nicely put together that after posting the pic to Yelp and facebook my image immediately received almost a dozen \"likes\" about how impressive it all looked (the people have spoken.

BONUS POINTS: Our orders came the customary complimentary asian style salad with sweet dressing and Miso soup (which I always enjoy).

NEED TO WORK ON: After receiving our waters and my green tea, we did not see our server again with a top up until we were almost done dining. The restaurant was not busy when we were there so I expected at least a check in to see if we needed some more H2O

Overall, a surprisingly great experience!!! Near the airport definitely give this little spot on the corner of Airport Road and Derry Road a shot!

{"text":"I admit, I was all \"ye of little faith.\" Looking for the closest lunch spot, sans the use of a Yelp app, kinda freaks me out. But low and behold, a pleasant surprise. 

Located in a lackluster looking strip mall near the airport, this sushi and teppanyaki spot is deceivingly non-descript from the outside. With take away menus reveal \"grand opening\" and truly deserted in the middle of the afternoon, I was leery. But, upon closer investigation I discovered that they've actually been open for a year and it's quite the swank spot on the inside. 

The menu is jam packed with Asian fusion eats ranging from chow meins to raw. With no barometer of which way to order, I turned open the menu to sushi, ordered a hand roll combo and hoped for the best. Why handroll? 1) Rarely do I see this offered on a menu 2) I love handrolls. 

It didn't disappoint. The four rolls (Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, california and shrimp tempura) were fresh, substantial and came with a hearty piece of ripe avocado, an unexpected surprise. The only one I'd skip on is the california roll. But I'm kinda of a snob when it comes to my fish, or imitation fish as the case may be. But with a combo that comes with salad and miso soup first, I was didn't need that fourth roll. 

Lessons learned: take the chance. The worst it's going to be is the preconceived notion you (okay, I) might have held onto with my west coast roots. But it could just turn out to be a solid 4 stars my friends."}
