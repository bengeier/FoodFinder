{"text":"The Nachos with BBQ Pork are the best in the world. Need I say more. 

Also good beer selection and great sports TV presentation. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good,but everything we tried to order they were \"out.\" Finally got the beef tartare, but honestly it was frustrating because everything we wanted to try they were out of it apparently. Also, you guys need a lot more servers"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Free Popcorn
- No reservation required.

Cons:
- Bad service
- Portion are small
- Beer pitcher not full
- Long service
- Burnt Food.

Conclusion:
Will never go again, either in that particular Cage au Sport OR any Cage au Sport."}
{"text":"Food Not bad and slightly overpriced.  When I visited they were short on staff. Wait staff was hustling. So  .....if your glass isn't full or the staff is direct, don't short tip ."}
{"text":"Super accueil, employés gentils, sympathiques, une service du tonnerre... en plus la nourriture excellente! J'y retourne certainement, meilleur endroit du quartier des spectacles rapport qualité/prix! Bravo et continuez votre excellence"}
{"text":"Food was terrible; \"buffalo\" wings lacked sauce - they were so dry I thought they'd brought me the wrong order.  Didn't want to finish those, so I ordered the blitz burger, which, while better than the wings, was still pretty bad.  Could've gotten a better burger at any of a dozen places in the neighborhood.

Service was just as bad.  It was a slow night (only 7 of us seated at the bar) when the Habs weren't playing, and I still couldn't get the bartender's attention.  After giving up on the cheeseburger, I couldn't get her to bring me my bill until I got up and started to walk out - that finally got her attention. I wasn't waiting just a short time, either - I was holding my credit card and trying to get my bill the last 7 minutes of the Buffalo-Edmonton game.

I get that it's a Canadiens bar, and 20 years in California means my French is now terrible, but the staff should be able to find time to take care of everyone when it's that slow.  And there's no excuse for the \"quality\" of food they were putting out tonight.

I flew in today, and am meeting up with friends tomorrow to go to the game.  They asked me to find a place for the 6 of us to go beforehand.  La Cage has far and away the best location for that, but there's still no way I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Depuis le changement de menu c'est inintéressant.  Les portions sont plus petite et les assiettes semblent vides.  Aucun problème de service, mais l'accueil pourrait aussi être mieux."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, especially when the habs are playing the bruins (of course). There are so many tvs to watch and the inside is decorated perfectly to fit the sports bar vibe. I did have some issues with this restaurant however. The service was super slow, which is expected on a night where the place is packed, but the kitchen took its time even after most people had cleared out. The service was also slower because we only speak english so we had to wait for the waiter who spoke english. Also the portions are pretty small, but the food does taste really good. I did like that there are always workers walking around clearing tables, and free popcorn is always nice with cold beer."}
{"text":"Came here during dinner time and the place was almost empty, pretty surprising given it is located in Carrefour Angrignon.

The service was average, the waiter never refill my water and only stopped by once to  ask the quality of the food. He then spent the rest of his time watching hockey. The ambience is really nice, and I can see it being filled with people during sports nights.

I had the Fish & Chips while my girlfriend had the Turkey and Apple Melt. The Fish was nicely cooked with very crispy batter, the chips however, was way too salty and harsh on the seasoning. That turkey sandwich, on the other hand, was nicely prepared and very light to eat.

I think it is better to come here during sports nights and to come here by groups, the ambience would've been more lively."}
{"text":"So I am pleased to write this review. Sunday's at La cage they have kids meals for $2.99 with an adult purchase above $12. They also have great deals throughout each day of the week as well. 

It's a very laidback and cool atmosphere. La Cage is one of my favourite places to eat at in Quebec. They have many TVs so watch as well and they are placed well throughout the location. 

Also if you subscribe to their newsletter everytime the Habs score 5 or more goals you get a coupon for free Wings to use before the next game !

They have many great starters as well. I'd suggest the potato skins."}
{"text":"Urgh! Came here with some friends to see the Habs playoff game, they could not accomadate us for whatever reason saying we needed a reservation, just 1hr prior to game time and the place was deserted almost not a soul, the hostess said if we like we can wait 45min for an open table if it opens up, instead we headed to the Bell Center and waited 15 minutes without reservations and was served, you just lost a 200$+ on poor service."}
{"text":"Food was great, ambience very relax and nice. We wanted to sit outside but the place was packed, luckily William the manager was able to accommodate us with a smile. Lea our server was so cool, courteous and very helpful. Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pire service ever j'ai appeler pour réserver et j'arrive là-bas et il me dise qu'il n'y a pas de réservation et me renvoie cher moi ! Je n'y vais plus jamais personnel incompétent et impolie"}
{"text":"Excelent service par une serveuse connaissant parfaitement les produits de microbrasserie.  Plusieurs suggestion appropriées. A1.

Repas ouffff.

Spag bolognese... le secret le mieux gardé de la cage. Toujours bon.  Mais le pain à l'ail devenu espèce de tacos grillé mou... à ne plus servir.

Tartare de boeuf.  Les miens ont aimé. Bien épicé. Pas moi. OK 50-50

Rondelles d'oignon maison.  Pas assez croustillantes.

Burger au Brie succulent mais viande un peu sèche.

Poutine parfaite avec sauce wow!

On y retournera? 

Oui.

C'est pas mal mieux que St-Hubert ou Boston Pizza.  En fait, beaucoup mieux"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Cage with some friends after a concert during the Francofolies. I must say the place looks very neat, you can tel it has been renovated recently.

The food was a bit overpriced for what you get, at least when it comes to their burgers.
We had a blizzard and a fried chicken burger (can't recall the name). Moreover, it is a sports bar so it can get pretty loud during evenings."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! NOT like other C.A.S your better off @ the one's Downtown where at least there they know how treat their customers."}
{"text":"Bon j'aime bien la nouvelle image de la cage, mais je pense que les prix sont encore trop haut pour la qualité des plats. Honnêtement, l'ambiance est agréable et le pop-corn est toujours aussi bon, mais je pense que la seul façon de s'en sortir avec une facture raisonable c'est de profiter des rabais du jour sinon c'est plutôt dispendieux. 

De plus, certain élément sur le menu était très bon et ils les ont retiré."}
{"text":"Boff...

Honnetement, mais attentes  ne sont jamais super haute quand je vais à la cage, mais cette fois ci le service etait tout simplement absent. L'hotesse qui nous a guidé a notre table semblait être endormis comme s'il etait 6h du matin et notre serveuse ne venait jamais nous voir et ne nous a même pas parlé des rabais du jour. 

Bref le repas etait ok et notre drink faisait l'affaire, mais le service etait tellement mauvais que je ne peu pas donner une note plus haute !"}
{"text":"I have never been impressed by le Cage venues, unless I am hockey night mode- I don't mind paying for a beer with complimentary popcorn. We came here for a girls night. Of course- we are going to be the weird crowd that orders wine at a pub (not myself but the others).The wine selection is mediocre- but the bottles are reasonably priced if you are counting on coming in a group to split the charge.
They don't have much choice for rose.

Food: The food quality is poor- lacking flavour, and undercooked. However- I guess I would pick McDonalds over this place.

Service: It would be nice to have a waiter that respects a group of women and doesn't constantly make inapropriate sexual jokes while being served- being friendly clients doesn't mean we want to take your crap."}
{"text":"It's part of a chain that keeps getting pricier and the portions are getting smaller.

I went there because the habs scored 5 goals and they offer 8 free wings during the next day.

The wings are pretty decent and I do like free.

But getting a plate of nachos with barely any cheese or salsa is a letdown.

The place is noisy, it's normal for a sports bar but what I don't get is why they drown out the sports commentators between breaks to put their own music. 
Wouldn't sports fans want to know what's going on?"}
{"text":"Pas un grand fan! 

Nourriture correct dans le meilleur des cas, service acceptable quand ont est chanceux, j'y vais seulement pour des evènements sportifs habituellement en \"pay per view\" avec des  amis. Sinon, il n'y a pas de raison de faire le détour."}
{"text":"There are a few of these restaurants. We do not normally like chain restaurants, but really enjoyed this one. We visited two different locations because we liked it so much we were craving their wings. The beer was good (and local choices) and we also ordered the black pepper and salt wings and salmon tartare lettuce tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty great sports bar, unless there's an actual game on, it will be extremely fun. (If you come for a vacation and only speak English this is the place to go.) it is actually an extremely well kept, and very clean bar. Waiter was great, overall pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Went on a super busy night the ufc fight so getting a table wasn't easy but with calling the woman twice and telling her we would be there before 9:30 she found me me a seat.

I ordered a club with salad got a fries instead don't really blame them as it was so busy it's a honest mistake. Inside the club had this terrible sauce almost similar to the Big Mac but worse. It's microwave bacon and weird shredded chicken. I do not recommend that at all.

My friend and the burger with fries and liked it. I believe it was called blitz. The wings were good can't complain there.

Bathrooms are clean usually little places like that have crap everywhere. (Points there lol)

Beer was great but can't go wrong with sleeman on tap.

Can't say the same for my friends drinks tasted like pure water which was a let down. Almost as big of a let down of Connor mcgregor losing that night :)"}
{"text":"When selecting \"Has TV\" the options are only Yes, No, Not Sure... they need to add an OMG hella yes option to that to properly explain that yes this place is the civilian version of NORAD when it comes to having screens.

Besides having a plenitude of screens to look at the place is dressed up really well for a place that is not in Montreal (centre-ville I mean), looks like it's large enough to host an NHL draft and has a variety of sports represented well here.

I noticed the brick wall had an American football design (no C line, just a 50 yd line), baseball bats as a gate where the walkway was and a lot of hockey sticks over the two rather large concentration of screen ARRAYS that are simply WOW.

Oh yes they also have a huge list of beers to select on tap and a pretty healthy looking menu.  I went with the Blitz Burger which was only 10 bucks for lunch before tax!  It's a not so standard bacon cheeseburger on a bakery brought in brioche which is probably the one of the best buns I've ever had on a burger with a nice sized and tasting side of fries... 10 bucks!  This is one the wickedest deals I've had for a sit down burger in a very long time not to mention it was very good too.

Add to the fact that the place for lunch was packed and service was good.  I can understand why this place is so busy and popular even though it's a chain here in Montreal it's not something we have back home.  If we had a place serving these kinds of quality burgers for 10 bucks for lunch it would also be packed as well...

I was told trying to get into this place on game night is difficult... I can see why considering the atmosphere and all around good vibe not to mention the decent food."}
{"text":"This place is massive and awesome! One of the best sports bars to watch sports and have a few drinks. Strolled into this place for the GGG vs Canelo fight and it was packed!  We were still lucky enough to get a seat even though the fight was just about to start.

There are TVs everywhere at every angle so you don't miss a beat.  

My friends ordered and shared the nachos which were quite big, and I had their cookie sundae which was surprisingly more delicious than anticipated.  Didn't drink because of the night before, but my buddies ordered some local beer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite traditions is to go to this Cage before a hockey game to enjoy some popcorn and nachoes. Watching a game on their big TV screens is also a lot of fun. The vibe in there is always enjoyable as you can feel the hockey fever all around you. I usually don't stray from my usual order of nachoes, which are delicious. The endless supply of popcorn is a bonus. Service can be a bit slow but it's to be expected when you go right before or during a game. The waiters and waitresses have always been nice and full of energy. We always have fun conversations about the game with them. Overall, it's always been a great experience for me to dine here with fellow habs fans."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the fight.  Very busy but decent service even though it's packed. Drinks taste watered down a bit so you gotta ask for the vodka and the juice seperately. Also theres free popcorn which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Walked Out. After being seated and waiting 15 minutes while many servers passed our table, we decided to leave.
A very busy Sports bar."}
{"text":"For a sports bar it is mediocre.  If you're not looking for a sports bar to watch a game, don't even bother, (you should probably start reading the names of restaurants).

There is ample seating, but to me almost feels like a large cafeteria.  Both nights I've been were very quiet, maybe the location, I am not sure.

We ordered your typical sports bar food, nachos, wings, mozza sticks, (yum), and of course draft beers...

The positives are that it is plenty large enough for a big group, TVs in view from anywhere you sit, you don't have to get dressed up, and they speak fluent French."}
{"text":"Lousy Service.  Ordered 500ml bottle of wine to start.  I have been here for 2 hours and not one person has asked if I would like to eat.  What a joke.  I get it.  It's a bar.  They don't care about food.  So why have a menu.

My advice. Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"La Cage is your typical sports bar. Pretty straightforward with a lot of tvs and seating.

We came for a drink while waiting for a reservation at another place. Drinks were inexpensive and hit the spot. 

Bartenders were attentive and we enjoyed watching some sports to kill time.

We did not try the food but it looked like your standard bar fare. 

Come by to watch a game. This is a great place for that."}
{"text":"Had a great time here! I did not come on game night so it was amazing, fast service and hot food. The staff was really friendly and not stressed out. The jumbo TV screens had poker games playing, which is kinda boring, but I still had laughs watching it. 

The food was food good, and a nice little spicy zing to the chicken wings. Lots of beer to choose from which is mostly tap. The soft drinks come in a large glass mug which is great because it lasts longer. 

It took the staff a while to refill the popcorn machine. They only refilled it when I finished my dinner.

In then end had a good experience."}
{"text":"Très bon emplacement, facile de se rendre et de stationner, en auto ou en autobus. Il y a une machine de popcorn. Oui, du popcorn gratuit. À volonté!!! Je capotais ! (Je pense qu'ils l'ont encore mais je suis pas allée récemment donc je suis pas sure). Je trouve que l'ambiance est super le fun, le prix est assez bien et la qualité de la nourriture est satisfaisante. Le menu offre des pâtes, de la viande, des ailes de poulet, etc. Il y a donc de la variété, mais plus de choix rendraient le menu encore mieux. Le service est assez bon !"}
{"text":"Very nice place to go out and enjoy Over 18 Kinds of Beer, a Delicious Menu and Major Sporting Events. Prices are a little bit high, the staff is nice. If you love free unlimited popcorn this is your place."}
{"text":"La cage c'est un peu \"the place to Be\" avant un match au centre bell et même pour tous les Match des Canadians.
En effet l'endroit possède un accès direct au centre Bell ce qui permet de prendre un verre en attendant que les portes ouvrent. Si vous n'avez pas de billet c'est bien aussi car il y a des écrans partout... bon il y a aussi des gros poteaux devant mais ce n'est pas partout.
Le service est très souriant et il y a vraiment pas mal de monde que ce soit en salle ou derrière le bar. Ils sont tellement nombreux qu'il y a toujours quelqu'un pour vous demander si vous voulez autre chose... peut être un peu trop même. 
Coté ambiance c'était sympa aussi surtout après une victoire des canadians...
Pour ce qui est de la nourriture je dois avouer que j'ai été un peu déçu par le Fich and chips. Pas forcement le meilleur poisson et la panure ne tenait pas trop. Ca manquait un peu de croustillant. Bon pour compenser il y du pop corne en libre service 
Au final C'est pas mal pour aller voir un match mais je vous conseil de réserver car c'est vite plein et que la priorité en début de soirée est donné à ceux qui on un ticket pour le match."}
{"text":"Je ne suis vraiment pas une fan de La Cage au départ, mais je voulais voir leur nouveau menu!! Eh bien, il n'y a pas \"grand\" chose de nouveau... et les prix sont tellement hauts c'est ridicule! Ça nous a coûté 50$ pour une entrée à partager et de la sangria! De plus, le service était trop trop mauvais! La serveuse ne voulait clairement pas travailler cette journée-là et elle nous l'a fait sentir! 

Vraiment décevant !!"}
{"text":"Sans être une fan des cages aux sports, celle-ci est entièrement rénovée, elle propose plusieurs bières et le service est rapide et courtois! Comme elle est située en plein coeur du quartier des spectacles, c'est génial pour déguster une bière dans l'après-midi avec une petite entrée à partager ! 

Perso, je vous recommande d'y aller avant de dépenser votre argent au St-Hubert à côté! :)"}
{"text":"Right next to the Bell Centre, this place is really great. We got a seat near a window, I ordered a Poké bowl with salmon tartare, a wine rosé, and a Shirley Temple. When the meal arrived, half of the bowl has rice, salads, salmon, and a mayo type cream included.  The wine complimented well with my meal and I was in heaven with the Shirley Temple. 

My meal was deducted from the 15 dollars I have received as a birthday gift. 

Overall, the price is decent for the location and the service was superb!"}
{"text":"Bien dégueux le dindon avocat :( Déjà qu'en groupe on est obligé de payer d'avance, en plus le burger et limite mangeable, pas besoin de me le servir sur une planche de bois j'aurais juste préféré qu'il soit bon. Puis, la petite chose qui est toujours décevante quand on aime le Coke, c'est qu'on vous serve du Pepsi, ça doit être dans toutes les cages aux sports..."}
{"text":"The place was quiet when I went, after all it was a cold Sunday afternoon.

I had a few drinks. The barmaid was nice and polite. This is a sports bar with televisions everywhere.

If you're near by stop in and have a drink or something to eat"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Got the veal burger with a poutine and some onion rings.  They brought me a soft drink by accident and didn't charge me.  The service was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Fun family friendly atmosphere. Good sports bar with plenty of TVs with every local offering and some out of town games. Great indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor sports bar. Outdoor pretty view of the street.  Unlimited baskets of popcorn you can self serve keeps kids happy while you wait.  Seated right away, but took another 15 minutes before our server came. Annoying, but no big deal. Reminder to slow down and enjoy your surroundings more. Diverse menu, great beer selection. My girls had sirloin steak, which was very good. I had the beer battered cod, which was very good but only one piece of fish on a huge pile of fries, left me wanting more fish. Baby back ribs were OK. Tasty but not much on them, and not fall off the bone good like you want them to be. Our server was very nice, but didn't come around often enough to check drinks, take away empty plates and had to wait long time to get the check.  After spending a couple days in Montreal, that seems to be a common issue having to wait for your check.  Overall, a good family pick for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here yesterday and it took 10 minutes for the waitress to come outside and sit us, and then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come. The placemats weren't set and it took another 5 minutes for a waitress to bring them. Our SODAS took forever to come out and the food was mediocre. Maybe the service seemed so so slow because I am visiting from Philly United States and everyone there is so fast paced, but this place took forever!!!"}
{"text":"Had a Daiquiri and 16 wings! Both the flavor of the food and drinks, and the interior design of the place are very decent! And I love the 5 score-8 wings deal there! There's free popcorn too. The waitress I got  was not very nice, but it's not that bad."}
{"text":"Terrific salads and flatbread. And Anthony V does a great job as server. Beer selection is not too shabby either."}
{"text":"Depuis que cette franchise a changé son menu, la bouffe qui y est servie est correcte dans son ensemble, pour un bar sportif bien sûr. Je suis venu ici un soir de match durant les séries éliminatoires et la place était bondée. Malgré le nombre élevé de clients, nous avons reçu un service convenable et nos assiettes ont été livrées dans un temps acceptable. La bouffe n'a rien de génial, mais c'est parfait pour regarder un match entre amis. J'accorde un petit extra pour les écrans TV qui sont vraiment partout. 

Vous l'aurez compris, on ne vient pas ici pour un premier RV galant, à moins de ne rien comprendre aux femmes. Sinon, dans le genre, c'est pas mal."}
{"text":"It's a very busy sports bar with nice vibes but not the food. 
I have been here twice. This time I came at a Monday 9pm. The place was packed. Reservations are recommended. I had a beer and two fish tacos. The beer was refreshing but the beer head had receded, leaving behind noticeable lacing. The tacos were bland and the only taste was moyo. There was too much moyo, and it dripped a little. 
If I ever come back, I would like to have a drink on terrace and probably skip the food."}
{"text":"Free popcorn! The best part about this restaurant . Their popcorn is so good. 
Food is alright. Great service and ambiance though."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for the Jazz Festival and the weekend of Canada Day so it was pretty nuts.  We ate here because we wanted to sit outside and our choices were pretty limited.  The food was ok, service ok.  Higher end pub food and costs it.  Steaks pretty tiny for the cost and again just ok."}
{"text":"La Cage hit the mark with their decor but slightly misses with the food. During my visit I ordered fish tacos thinking how can anyone ruin fish tacos?  La Cage managed to accomplish that fete. The tortillas were cold which was in complete conflict with the hot fried cod. There was a white sauce almost like an aioli which was delicious but the total package was a huge dud for me. Good thing I also ordered a green salad which as turns out was incredible. Fresh, delicious and unlike any Greek salad I've ever tasted. The servers were very friendly and polite; the ambiance inviting. My friends who ordered steak and chicken said they were both well seasoned and delicious. I would still go back steering clear of the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This spot is located right in the bell centre
Staff are friendly
They have a popcorn machine as you walk in to snack on
Its a massive 2 floor restaurant with private rooms aswell 
Close enough to go prior to a hockey game or concert
Food is good average priced
Cleanliness is ok... there was a rib on the floor beside our table.
Portions are average."}
{"text":"In Fantastic location but sadly the potato skins were just fair and the lemonade was not good and the poutine was just sad. The club sandwich was good though. Service was ok. We sat outside in perfect weather so that helped our experience. La Cage is ok just don't expect anything fantastic....."}
{"text":"Got in early before Saturday's game so we had our pick of tables.  With two hours to game time ALL the tables were full with a line up the stairs, out the door, and down the block.  Message is get here early!

Menu and food was very average.  There were no reference to Habs teams or stars of the past, only average bar food.

She had chicken strips with fries and I had a cheese burger with fries.  Chicken was coated well but not over done.  Taste was good.  Burger was over cooked (no choice offered) but with sauce it more than made up.  Only complaint would be with the fries.

The fries are skin on, non-coated, seconds.  They sucked.  The house is over serving fry bits rather than spending more for a better quality fry and serving less (bigger, unbroken to give better plate coverage).  Restaurant operations 101.

Service was friendly and mostly on point.  

Bottom line, there are other places to spend you sixty bucks pregame."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work and because my hotel was just a block or two from this sports bar I decided to give it a try on night. I was presently surprised when I was seated and took a look at the menu, they have a good selection of beer and different foods. The prices were moderate and the service was prompt, it's a great place for a quick bite to eat, I recommend the spaghetti!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal during the AFC championship game of New England Patriots vs Jacksonville Jaguar was looking for a sports bar and my hotel recommended here.   The atmosphere was great since the Bruins were playing as well.   Staff was very friendly and food was great.   Will be back."}
{"text":"La Cage was the first stop for my group of 10 when we arrived in Montreal for a bachelorette party. We were seated quickly at a long table with super comfy big chairs, despite our large group size. We ordered drinks - beers, champagne, some mixed drinks. Our waitress came back with some of our drinks but also had to tell us that they did not have champagne and also did not have the type of vodka one of our guests ordered. We gave alternate orders and were given shots as compensation so it ended up being okay! The food was delicious - poutine to start, a variety of sandwiches and such for lunch. My sandwich had bacon, fig, gruyere cheese - DELICIOUS (see photo). Service was a bit slow, but we were having fun so we really didn't mind the wait. Would definitely return for a relaxed lunch next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"If this is your first time in Montreal, you're a hockey fan, and looking for an authentic experience, you can't miss this place right next to Centre Bell!

This place was a lot of fun, and one of the more unique sports bar experiences I've ever had right outside of an arena. The food was pretty good- I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich with poutines on the side and a glass of beer from a local brewery. Nonetheless, this place is all about the atmosphere, and for a hockey fan it is heaven! Gigantic TVs showing Canadiens game, everyone was wearing their red sweaters, and the place was alive!! One of the last true hockey towns remaining. Proof the sport isn't dead just yet!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no cheese on nachos, he took away but brought back with more green onions ! Tiniest chicken wings i have ever seen as well. Went away hungry"}
{"text":"A hockey fan in Montreal needs to visit Bell Centre at least once, even though I'm not a Canadiens fan as such. 

One of the best burgers I've had for some time: Alarm. Bacon & jalapeno added just the right amount of extra taste to raise above an average hamburger. Patty was perhaps slightly overcooked but that did not matter. For 15 dollars it was not cheap but worth the price. 

Sat at the bar, quick'n'friendly service. A number of interesting beers on the tap, so I did not have to settle for yet another mediocre lager... 

Would I return: yes, for sure. Burger was fine as was the beer, not to even mention the legendary location"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Beer is cold, thank goodness. The main tv is ungodly huge, I'd LOVE to see a game here! It is Canada though, so I came to see my baseball team play, and they only had news on an Edmonton oiler extending his contract on the tv lol. Good Canadian beers on draft. The servers wear short black dresses so that's a plus. Be sure to bring your french translator, as everything in Quebec is in French only."}
{"text":"J'adore la cage au sport bon repas bon choix de bière et vin pas toujours donner comme prix des repas et entrée mes toujours bon excellent service de serveuse et serveur"}
{"text":"J'aime bien la cage au  sport
