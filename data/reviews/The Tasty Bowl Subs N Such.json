{"text":"To keep it short: Great service - The staff were very friendly, and the owner was totally willing to answer any questions or offer some suggestions. He gave me a \"sample\" that could have been my lunch alone.  Even Better Food: Everything is terrific, very fresh, and in a very generous size. For the price and quality, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Ordered the curried jerk bowl with chicken. Spice level 9. Pretty tasty and a lot of food! If you're not sure, the owner is very talkative and helpful. Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Seriously, stop reading this and go! All of the 5 star reviews are true. Food and staff are terrific. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place and the people who work there are awesome. I shamed to admit I've probably been there 7-10 times in the past 2 weeks. There's a good chance they sprinkle crack on their rice bowls, they are so good!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service...The owner Raja is amazing and takes pride in his food. For vegetarians out there even though there is nothing on the menu they cook up a nice veg rice bowl with amazing sauces. I took the mango habenaro sauce veg rice bowl and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I noticed this restaurant about a month ago and thought to myself \"what an oddly placed restaurant\" as it is in the middle of Westinghouse between South Tryon and 160.  I went back to my office and googled to see what they had to offer. Then today, based on those reviews, I decided to try it out. OMG I am so glad I did!!! Holy Moly, that was delicious! I walked in and was immediately greeted. After staring at the menu blankly for a bit trying to figure out what to order, I was asked if I had been there before. The moment I said no, I was asked if I like spice. I described the level of spice I can handle and bam, I had a sample handed to me, a good size sample.... and it was delicious. I ended up talking to Raja for a while about catering and the different offerings they have. He had asked for my name for my order and actually used my name several times rather than just to shout out my order was ready (which would have been odd anyway as it was ready within the time we were still talking and I was standing right in front of him lol). I ordered the Sesame Ginger Teriyaki, size regular, and sadly ate it all when I returned to my office (I could have stopped at half but it was so good!). If you are in the Steele Creek area looking for a new lunch spot, I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find.....I would have never known about this place if it wasn't for other reviews. The rice bowl was so good and they give you so much. I'm a big guy and I got the large thinking it was going to be breakfast but nope I still more than half left for lunch later on."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend trying the rice bowls. I had the jerk chicken rice bowl. Amazing! So much flavor popping in my mouth, the spiciness isn't overpowering, just wonderfully put together.  The staff was very helpful & friendly. I will definitely be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food! Owner is very involved and loves to chat up his food (and for good reason). Explained I was from out of town and he still insisted I try a sample. Price was reasonable and quality was excellent. I will make a point of coming back next time I am in town on business."}
{"text":"Hubby had gyro & I had Italian (less peppers) & we shared fries.  Mine was very yummy and fresh. Hubby enjoyed gyro. I orders extra sauce but he didn't need. He found it to be extremely flavorful. We will be definitely be coming back soon & not just because we work within a mile or so down the rd.  Highly recommend them!   3rd trip - still great place. I meet Roger today & he has lots of info & suggestions. Please come in and give it a try!! You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Everyone here is amazing. The food is great, the experience great! I really appreciated the owner walking me through the food process and allowing my to try the rice before purchasing and following up after I finished my meal. Would definitely recommend and visit again!!"}
{"text":"This is a little gold mine tucked away.  I'm glad it was on Yelp.  My first visit...I will  be back.  I had the small chicken brown rice bowl with the sweet Thai chili sauce.  It was amazing!!!  I had two meals from the small bowl...lot of food.  The lady at the counter offered me various sauces to try before ordering. Great service and efficient.   For those of you who need to cater  office lunches...this a great option for something different in the workplace.  I will be back and bringing some friends !"}
{"text":"Ok, first time I ever gave 5 stars. Very interesting place with a creative menu. The rice bowls look like they are the huge hit. My wife and I split a sub. Everything including the service was exceptional. This menu could support a much larger restaurant in my opinion.  A must try and you will be hooked like we are."}
{"text":"I am a believer!! Been reading all these great reviews and finally in town long enough to try this place...FANTASTIC!!!  Service is amazing! Very friendly helpful owner and staff, and the food!!! Taste of heaven! Served up quick with so many amazing fresh flavors. Will be back, often as possible!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp rice bowl with jamaican jerk sauce was to die for!!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome flavor and personalized service.  Owner is friendly and will know you by name after just one visit. Not sure what you want to eat and he'll give you a taste test.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Ate  lunch here today with a friend. the food and service was excellent.  Mangoi rice bowl is a must have."}
{"text":"I was the envy of my office when I returned with my take-out from the Tasty Bowl.   The staff was a lot of fun and it was obvious that customer satisfaction (and interaction) is very important to them.   Looking forward to returning and trying more off the menu."}
{"text":"Had the curried jerk small bowl for lunch today. It was great. The folks who work there were so friendly and concerned that I wouldn't get more spice than I could handle.  It turned out to be just right. Really good healthy food.  I did notice that there are zero options for vegetarians when they could easily do just a veggie rice bowl.  I try to order vegetarian generally but ended up getting chicken because I didn't want to be a pain.  I get the feeling they would have made a veggie bowl if I'd asked though."}
{"text":"Awesome host and tasty food. Owner helps to understand the spice needs and made it perfectly as per my taste"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and local. My favorite lunch spot during the week. The owner is funny and very personable. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I need to update my review already!   This place is fantastic! I tried a different bowl this time and it was delicious. The owner remembered us! And even came to sit with us to make sure we enjoyed our meals.   Top notch service!   They have a new loyal customer and forever fan!"}
{"text":"Raja is the man! I have been here about 4 times then I recently went back after about 6 months and he remembered my name"}
{"text":"Very tasty indeed!  I'll be back!!!  Can't wait to try other flavors. Lots to try. Great tasty flavors mixed together for those with a diverse palate!  Don't miss out on this hidden little gem!!!   Partybuscharlotte org for party rockin' buses!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat, especially if you like spicy food...I had the Jamaican jerk with the secret ingredient.... Ghost pepper cheese... Loved it... the only reason they didn't get 5 stars...I dint like the fries.. but hell I don't really like fries anyway"}
{"text":"Great place , Friendly staff good food reasonable price. The rice bowl had lots of flavor and can be custom. Location is easy to find. Busy but still severed quickly."}
{"text":"Walked in and the owner asked us if it was our first time and it was. Right then we were offered samples based on his recommendation (since we were open to about everything) and our spice level.   One bite of the Thai sweet chili and Jamaican Jerk rice... BLAST OF FLAVOR! I was planning for a pita but the rice was too good. Maybe next time! In the end we got the Jamaican Jerk and Mango Habanero rice. I LOVED the Jamaican Jerk, and the spice lvl 8? was no joke. It built up haha. My bf preferred the Thai sweet chili but everything was delicious nonetheless. No lack of spice at all but I will definitely get more pico de gallo and we are super excited to come back next time to try the other flavors.   Hidden gem. People who work in the area have probably known about it for awhile but for newcomers, this is a place you won't regret :)  We will be back for the owner's friendly/inviting gestures, rice bowls, and maybe their homemade fudge too!"}
{"text":"Best thing I EVER yelped EVER!!  Had an amazing chicken Philly and saw countless other dishes for which I need to return. I sadly live like 500 miles away."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a long time and finally got the chance.  Like most reviews say, the owner guy is pretty cool, engaging, welcoming, interactive, etc., etc.,.  I immediately felt as ease even though it was my first time, the asked me how much spicy I like my food to be and I said \"Indian spicy\" so makes me a sample of 'Curried Jerk' rice and WOW!! one bite and I was in no doubt what I was going to order and I said 'this is good' and he says 'go on, finish the rest, you will feel the heat kicking in'.  lol Nevertheless I ordered the regular size bowl of Curried Jerk Chicken and another order of Mango Habanero.  He said, the Curried Jerk is about a 8 spice level and Mango Habanero is about a 5.   I had to wait for a few short minutes for my to-go order and the quantity of a regular bowl was more than sufficient for one."}
{"text":"Had a sweet Thai chili salad with chicken. Quality fresh ingredients. Great flavor. Chicken was a little tough but not a big issue. I work nearby and this a big step up from most of the places around here. Will definitely return and also will recommend to coworkers. They had me sample some spicy black beans that were good and also the jerk rice bowl and I regretted not getting the rice for lunch. Also everyone was friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"The owner is a very funny special guy. Friendly like an old friend. The food is out of this world! I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel like I have to, for a restaurant this good with good service."}
{"text":"I went to tasty bowl today for the first time! I told myself a while ago that no matter what comes to that location I'm not going to go because I am still mad Snoops closed! But today a really sweet girl came into my work and gave me a menu and it was filled with my favorite go-to lunch - chicken pitas! The prices were also slightly under what I'm used to for this area so I decided to head over and give it a try.  I had a really pleasant experience. The food was fresh, hot, and fast. In addition, the owner took the time to ask me where I worked and he even gave me a sample of his Thai sweet chili rice bowl and it was AMAZING! The sauces are homemade and everything is so fresh tasting! It was topped with pico de gallo and a layer of shrimp sauce - both of which were obviously homemade. The owner was kind and generous and when you combine that with fresh, delicious, reasonably-priced food - this place is destined for success!   Don't be afraid to try a rice bowl - I honestly wouldn't have ordered it but after trying the sample, I have no doubt I will be back quite regularly to chase down that fresh, saucy deliciousness!  **UPDATE*** 18 days and more than five rice bowls later, I can officially say this is one of the only places in Steele Creek that I CRAVE! Im so happy to see this place always busy...hopefully that means they will be around for a long time! It's definitely something delicious, unique, and really good quality in the area and was much-needed!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Been here twice now and left full, with a little bit left over.  Good size portions and fresh food.  The owner is very friendly and will answer any questions about the menu.  They are only open from 10 - 4 Mon - Fri but do not miss them."}
{"text":"(1/26/17) I just noticed  the  pick up order function  here on Yelp, definitely  a nice feature. Something  that's  a  bit new is samples of everything  that Raj thinks that you might like. It's a great  way  to  try things you haven't  had before  and to think how delicious  they would  taste  in a rice bowl.  Today I'm  having  another  I don't  know. I have no idea what's  in it other than steak and shrimp  but it's always  flavorful. It turned out to be a Teriyaki Jerk rice bowl that wasn't big on heat & spice but rather on flavor. It made a nice change to my spices from hell voyage that I had been on since I knew about the place. Tasty Bowl is branching out from the rice bowls and now offers soups, chili & pasta dishes. Every day there's a different special. If I could I'd eat there every day but for now I have to limit myself to one or two days at most."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I work (just two buildings down) so I went here the first time for convenience but I've gone several more times since then because the food is actually really good.  I first got the teriyaki pita but since then I've taken a liking to their rice bowls which are really good.  I've been trying out the different flavors and each one has been great.  I'd recommend any of those to anyone trying this place for the first time."}
{"text":"First time in. Walk in the place is busy and the employees are working hard. Friday's special was shrimp and grits, which I'm not a fan of but everyone was ordering it. It was amazing I will definitely order again. Food was great service was great easy 5 stars"}
{"text":"Such an amazing atmosphere, the owner is a blast! Makes great conversation and let us sample all of the rice flavors to find our favorite flavor. The food is so delicious. If you like curry definitely try the Indian curry rice, it's spot on. Do not overlook this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tasty Bowl is a hidden gem here in the Steele Creek area. They have the best fries not only in Charlotte, but anywhere. I highly recommend this place for a fast, delicious lunch. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge. The Indian curry rice bowl is out of this world. Get the fries. And get the onion rings. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow, went here today for lunch; first time. Sooo good; Yelp reviewers got this one right! Got the Thai sweet chili sauce with chicken bowl and it was yummy. The man caught me looking at the menu, and asked if it was my first time and walked me through the flavors and their spice levels. Then I got a sample. I'll definitely be back to try other flavors and menu items!"}
{"text":"The food and The service is the reason why I will go back. Small spot with no frills but the rice bowls are amazing, fresh and the sauces are tasty!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, fast service, clean restaurant. Make sure you know your own spice level before ordering!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gym. I discovered it on a yelp list and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. I went with the jerk chicken rice bowl. Many places list an item as spicy and it barely has any spice, but here spicy really does mean spicy which I can appreciate. Everything on the bowl tasted fresh and was cooked to perfection. The rice, which a lot of places slightly over cook, was absolutely perfect. The prices are SUPER reasonable for the portions that you get. I'm a big guy so I got a large thinking that's what I'd need to get full and I definitely couldn't finish it all. I ordered takeout via yelp so i didn't eat inside but it looked clean. The owner was super friendly and had me in and out in a jiffy. I'll be going back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I try to stop by every time I'm in town. Ingredients are fresh and the regular sized chicken rice bowls always fill me up. The large bowl can definitely feed 2 people.  The owner is really accommodating and comes out to make sure the food is too your liking. Would highly recommend trying this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood guys. This place has been open less than 6 months and it's quickly making a good name for itself. I visited strictly because of the great reviews on yelp so far.  I was greeted by the owner right as I walked in. His personality is very lively and infectious. You get how passionate he is about what he is doing.  I told him I had never been there before and so began the train of samples. It was unreal. \"Try this, try this, try this\". I was stuffed when I left and my order was to go.   The rice bowls are different. They like to play with flavors. It's like going to you buddies house that everyone says should open a restaurant. We'll this guy did.  My wife is celiac, so he ran through the ingredients he uses and made her something we both felt was safe for her to eat. She loved it. It was a buffalo chicken bowl.   I ordered the gyro, which was very good. I ate even though I was stuffed. To be honest, I bursting at the seams. My fault for over eating.  If you are in the Steele creek area, visit this small business and show them some love. They deserve it."}
{"text":"Sweet Thai chili bowl with chicken and shrimp & bourbon bowl with steak & shrimp. So delicious!!!!! The owner is super friendly & he'll let you sample some of the sauces. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The food was amazing. I was impressed most by the jerk rice. I didn't say jerk chicken I said rice. The rice had jerk flavor and it was amazing. But my bowls were both good I bought 2. Asian Thai and jerk chicken. Excellent! And the staff are so charming and friendly. Go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots around the city. Amazing amount of food for the price. My only complaint is the hours. Closes too early and I miss it a lot and closed on weekends. Would go a lot more if I could make it."}
{"text":"I crave this place all the time. Raja is the best and very personable."}
{"text":"Very good!!!  I had driven by several times, and decided to try it today.  The owner Roger asked me what I liked, if I liked spicy, gave me a sample of the rice, a sample of the soup.  I got a rice bowl with pico de galo, very good, very filling,I got a small.... Will have to come back and try the other things on the menu..... Came by to check and see how I liked it... Also gave me a loyalty card, and stamped it twice, even though it was my first time there...."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place to eat lunch I am a big fan of the Jamaican jerk shrimp rice bowl! Their sandwiches are amazing. Everything is tasty & most importantly fresh!. PLEASE try it if you haven't! The owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Sooo happy they opened closer to my office. I've had the rice bowl and garden bowl. I've had the sweet and sour pineapple and the bourbon. Everything is delicious! This is worth driving a few extra minutes. The staff is super friendly, the owner will come out in in-between cooking to check on customers. Did I mention how delicious the food is? You also get a lot for your money.  My whole office looked to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My coworkers and I were greeted as we entered the restaurant. The owner made us samples to try before ordering our meals. The food was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"The owner is incredible. Great food and customer service. Gave me a sample of the curied Jamaican rice because I was undecided. Not anymore, this is a must go and eat. I'll make the trip from Huntersville again to try other flavors of the rice bowls."}
{"text":"I've ordered Tasty Bowl to go three times. All times it has been amazing but the last one really blew me away. The first two times I ordered the Mexican chicken rice bowls and they were delicious. The regular size is huge.  Could easily cover two meals.   Today I tried the Jamaican Jerk Shrimp rice bowl which is a 9/10 on the heat scale. It was so delicious! The heat scale is no joke, it really did make me sweat. Sometimes spicy food can be so spicy it's unenjoyable but this was just perfect. Tasty to eat and left a nice kick of heat. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and you definitely get a ton of food with whatever you order. Can't wait to try the other flavors!! The owner is super nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little spot in the corner of an office complex on Westinghouse that you'd miss if you aren't looking for it.  SO LOOK FOR IT!  I went with a friend and wasn't expecting much... boy was I wrong!  Fresh, friendly, reasonably priced and tasty!  The bowls are large (even the small size) and come with many options to make it just what you like.  The sub sandwiches are also tasty complete with warmed rolls.  The people are friendly and helpful, the owner is very outgoing and the sweet tea is on point!  There's no reason to not try this place unless you're in a group...  the actual square footage inside is small, so this is NOT a great choice if you have a group of 5 or more."}
{"text":"Really good! I came here after driving past for several days and my coworkers recommending I try it out. The owner and the cooks were very nice and helpful. Making sure it was just what I wanted. Considering I already love rice bowls this place is now a new favorite."}
{"text":"Some of the friendliest counter folk, perhaps ever. At least some of it could be due to the location - despite knowing where you are going, you need to be on the lookout, as they are not only in a business park, but the park itself is a bit downhill from the road, and there is not a ton of signage, so be prepared.  Once there, you also need to figure out how to get in. They are located on the corner, but the \"main\" door is over on the one side, and there is a back door (somewhat like the back door at McDonald's, that is by the bathroom), and you can go in that way, but you'll end up in the back. The front door is a bit better.  Regardless, once you are there, they ask if you've been. Since it was my first visit, I don't know if they do this for everyone, or if it was just me, at which point they asked if I wanted to try some rice (or perhaps if I liked rice, but the idea is about the same). Since I'm all about the rice, I went with it, and then proceeded through a few other questions to try and find a good menu option. Several tastes later (and rapidly getting filled up already), their suggestion was a jerk chicken.  It actually was tasty, but I'm not a huge fan of jerk, so I decided to go a different direction, with something more Asian/Thai inspired. Again, the flavors were good, but a couple of things did just not hit the taste buds quite right.  The rice was a bit wet. This isn't a horrible thing, but it meant that it wasn't like a fried rice. The other thing is that the Thai Chili (closest I can come to describing the sauce) was more of a sweet sauce, with little heat to it. They did add some homemade hot sauce, but it wasn't a Thai sauce, more like a Tabasco or Texas Pete.  Since I was rather full already, I saved half of the regular (?) - the medium sized bowl and ate it later, at which point the flavors had mingled nicely. Ultimately it was a nice experience, but for those particular flavors, I think I would go elsewhere, and perhaps choose a different direction."}
{"text":"The owner was extremely polite and genuinely cares about his customers! The Best part was that the food was AMAZING!! I ordered the jerk/bourbon rice bowl!"}
{"text":"Pita was excellent, fast service thru Yelp. Will return again soon for something new!"}
{"text":"I recently started a new job in Charlotte and noticed my coworkers all coming back from lunch break with these deliciously smelling boxes of food over and over again. I thought I'd be nice one day and pick up one for myself and my coworkers, I told the nice lady on the phone my order and her customer service was phenomenal, asking on a scale of the 1-10 how spicy do I want mine. Who does that? I told her 7, and it was fantastic. The real treat was meeting the owner, Raja. He took time to introduce himself and tell me if I need to more or less spicy to let him know that way he can pretty much custom make my bowl for me. What! Once again, who does that? NOBODY IN TOWN! He was super friendly, asking what flavors did I get and then making some suggestions. This man genuinely cares about the people that come his restaurant. I can't wait to go back tomorrow and tell him about my review for his awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Tasty Bowl Subs and Such is truly a  hidden gem of Westinghouse Blvd. I ran across this restaurant playing around on Yelp and I'm glad I stopped in with a friend and my mom for lunch.   Being our first time we were full of questions. The owner Raja was very helpful. He asked what flavor spiciness we liked and created a few samples for us to try. I let my mom try one of the samples and she said it was too sweet so Raja created a new sample for her and it was a winner.   The concept for the rice bowls is very simple. You get rice, choice of sauce and meat (chicken or shrimp) and pico de Gallo. The menu is a little misleading cause there is a miss print but you only get one meat choice with the price on the menu or you can have both for an extra charge.   The bowls were amazing. What's really impressive is the size. We all ordered the small bowl and couldn't finish. We ordered a Sesame Ginger Teriyaki, Mexican and Thai Sweet Chili bowl and 2 orders of fries. The fries are very crispy and seasoned well. I'm not a fan of pico but I was very trusting of Raja and the mix of rice, chicken and pico was outstanding.   Raja came by our table to make sure we were all satisfied with what we ordered. He made some spicy sauce for my friend to add to her bowl. He's very personable and we learned he even remembers his regular customers choice of spiciness.    I will definitely be back. There are so many flavor options and I want to try the subs and their wings!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. The owner is so engaging and cares about every customer. Once you go a few times, he knows your name and what you normally order. He knows I like it light on the sauce so it's not too mushy and he always puts just the right amount of sauce. If you eat in the restaurant he will come around chatting with the tables and making sure everything is good. The medium bowl is PLENTY of food (and maybe some leftovers). I always get the shrimp bowl with brown rice with the sesame ginger teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, clean and friendly.  I was headed to the airport pulled them up on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised.  Thanks for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and the staff is very nice. If you want to taste the sauces they will mix some up for you right away.   Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Not a big yelper. But I had to say something about this place. Amazing, fresh, made-to-order menu... Pico de gallo! Service that shines beyond any casual joint I've experienced. Balaclava will make you see the baby Jesus - and they INSISTED they warm it up... If the staff in this \"mom & pop\" continue to execute at this level, this wonderful, unpretentious little joint will become a destination spot. The location is a little tough... Seek it out! What's missing? Not much. Some craft beer and domestic would be very cool. Maybe as the place gets seasoned, some memorabilia on the walls. But believe me... If you live in the Steele Creek area you should support this new place!"}
{"text":"The owner, Roger, is very friendly. The rice bowls are good. The sandwiches are great. The specials and the fresh soups are amazing. Highly recommend the place. Friendly staff and good quality foods."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here, and I will be back. The woman at the counter was very friendly. She started off by asking me if I liked no spice, little spice, or a lot of spice. The answer to that question helped her determined which bowl would be best for me, and she even made me a little sample. My chicken pieces were kind of big, but that's just a personal preference.   I ordered the Sweet Thai Chili Chicken Bowl (small)"}
{"text":"I came here from a recommendation from a co worker. Let's start from the beginning. I walked in and am immediately greeted. I walk to the counter and inform them I've never been here before. They asked me my comfort level with spicy food. Told them and before I could say anything else, I had a sauce sample and a rice sample. And these samples aren't small. Think syrafoam ice cream bowl size full. Yep! He said we can make anything on the menu or we can whip something up. I let him do his thing and whip me up something. Excellent decision, he made me a mango habanero bowl. WOW WOW WOW!!!! So good. There are three different sizes I opted for the regular which was plenty enough for me. Roger is extremely friendly and wants to make sure everything is perfect to your liking. He is open to suggestions and criticism, which is awesome because it makes you feel as if your opinion matters. The price was perfect. Honestly $11 for my meal and a drink is great. Especially since I couldn't finish it and will finish it for dinner. So two meals for me for $11. I'm okay with that! Let's get into the flavor. Everything is so fresh and flavorful, it will linger on your tongue after. So so so delicious. I will return and I absolutely recommend everyone come out and try this. They close at 4."}
{"text":"I think I love this place just because of its name - \"Tasty Bowl Subs n' Such\"? Genius. This place has a deli vibe but they serve not just sandwiches but also rice bowls with different sauces to choose from. The owner is super nice and will let you try a sample (rice and pico with the sauce you want to try in a decent sized cup). I've gotten the jerk and the teriyaki, and I have to say I do love the teriyaki. The jerk is also good but I thought it didn't work as well with the pico. Would recommend the chicken over the shrimp since they use the teeny shrimp that isn't the best.  Their fries are also AWESOME and just how I like em. They actually forgot to make ours so they threw in some onion rings which was very nice. Prices are reasonable and seating/parking is plentiful! Great quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Addictive! This place offers a very distinct taste that you can only get here! I don't like to leave reviews soon after I try a place, but I've eaten here 3 times in 3 weeks so hey. I usually get the Jerk chicken rice bowl with a level 9 for spice!  I LOVE IT! Sometimes the spice is overwhelming but the flavor is still there. The staff tries to call you by your name and make the experience more personable. It's really clean looking in the back. Nice little spot."}
{"text":"Ordered again today.  Food was excellent again.  Owner as friendly as ever.  I order 3 on a scale of 5 and not spicy at all to me.  Going to go hotter next time.  (Owner will know who I am)  :-)  One tip... the large and regular appear to have the amount of \"good stuff.\"   The difference is the amount of rice you get in my opinion.  Since I ordered from here in close proximity of dates, it was fresh in my memory.  In other words, don't order the large as its a couple bucks more for just more rice."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, seemingly healthy and very filling. I stopped for lunch at The Tasty Bowl, which is just off South Tryon on Weestinghouse. Subs and rice bowls on the menu, I decided on the chicken bowl with sweet and sour pineapple on top of brown rice. When my name was called a few minutes later, a major amount of lunch was ready.  A little sweet but tasty with flavor and lots of chicken. Crisp and crunchy vegetables and the rice was very soft. I cleaned the bowl.  As I was leaving, the owner sincerely apologized for not being available to make a recommendation. I don't know why - this was great!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, lots of options and combinations and the owner goes above and beyond. I only at half my bowl and he topped off my rice for the rest of the meal. Give it a try."}
{"text":"What took me so long to get here?!   The outside is nothing spectacular but do not be dismayed! If there is a line, it moves quickly so relax... it's worth it.   I wanted nothing but a rice bowl the other day so that's what I searched for (via Yelp) and this place came up. I looked at the menu and figured I would give it a try since they offered both Jamaican and Curry jerk rice options. The prices vary by the size, but my regular rice bowl totaled a little over $9.   Again, most places say their food is spicy and they somehow disappoint but this did not! Not only did I receive my food quickly (5-7 minutes), during the lunchtime rush, but it was GOOD! It was fresh, healthy and hearty all in one! But they have Philly's that look and smell delicious if you're not opposed to mid-day 'itis.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering rice bowls? Yup Tasty Bowl Subs N Such has them. I've been scoping this place out via yelp for a couple of weeks now . I decided today for lunch im going to finally try this place i have a good feeling im going to love it. Low and behold i called to place a order so it would be ready when i arrived and Raja who's the manager answered and he could tell i was unsure of what i really wanted i heard so much about the jerk chicken bowl when i mentioned it to him he asked did i like spicy food? I told him yes to a certain extent so he took it upon hiself to say hey tell you what when you come in ill give you a few samples so you can decide which rice bowl you want to order,surely when i arrived he said i been waiting on you, he did as he said he would and fixed me up a sample to make sure it wasn't to spicy for me if thats what i really wanted,well it was a winner and i was sold! Noticebly i realized Raja knew alot of the customers by name which let's me know he engages alot with his customers, now that i think about it he even asked me what my name was when he gave me the sample, also i noticed him walking around asking everyone how was their food etc, he will go very far, with all of that being said i ordered my Jerk Chicken Bowl and was on my merry way!"}
