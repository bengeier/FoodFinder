{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and have always left satisfied.  Consider what this restaurant is offering, in your decision to come or not.  All of the food is already prepared and kept warm behind the counter.  They don't offer table service, so you go up to the counter, pick what you want and take your plate back to your table yourself.  In other words, it's a cafeteria styled restaurant.  That doesn't mean it's not good, because it's far better than anything I've ever seen in a standard cafeteria or food court.  It's basically home-cooked food.  You might still want to consider what to order based on the fact that your food is already cooked and being kept warm, but realistically no restaurant is going to make cabbage rolls or stew from scratch at the time you order it.  To me, what's great about this place is that you can still have a very good meal in very little time, even when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I've been to this bistro cafe a few times and I absolutely love it. The food is delicious, the portions are great, and the staff are very friendly and can answer any questions you might have about the food. My mom was very impressed the first time she came here, and said that she felt like she was visiting Poland as the food was very authentic. I recommend the beef tripe soup, it's the best I've ever tried! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing home cooked food and friendly home style service! You really feel welcome and at home.  The people really take pride in their food. There was a man and a woman behind the counter. My mom was in front of me and the man took great pride in explaining each and every dish to my mom. Wow, great service! This really helped me out because the variety was ample and it was my first time there.  The woman was equally as helpful and I didn't feel rushed into picking my meal.  The spread is amazing! You get to choose from numerous entrees such as schnitzel pork meatballs, white fish, salmon, beef goulash and many more! There were great sides such as buckwheat, rice, potato dumplings, mashed potatoes, which you can cover in mushroom sauce or other sauces. You get to pick three side salads such as coleslaw, Caesar salad, mixed salad, beets, there's just so many to choose from and to name!  To order, you go up to the counter where you can see all the delicious offerings.  They have great dessert selection, candies and chocolates. They have drip coffee and an espresso machine. They also serve polish beer and drinks.  The ambiance is great. Decor is nice, they have blue and yellow napkins with a stylish holder, sunflower on the table and decorated walls. It is bright and inviting.  Prices are great and you can't beat it especially because all the meals are home style cooking!   There is ample parking in the back.  I would love to come back and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. I want to try everything at least once!!"}
{"text":"Everything is home made! Great service every time we have come for a visit.love those dumplings and mushroom sauce. Found a new love-potato pancakes and delish buckwheat rice. Will come back for this wholesome meal filled with goodness and love."}
{"text":"If you like Polish food you'll love this place. Opened very recently, Polka offers a variety of meats and fish, potatoes, dumplings, veggies, soups and desserts. Oh, and Polish beer. You order at the counter and they dish out the food. Very yummy! And the staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cute little family owned Polish cafe hidden in a plaza. Ive nvr heard of this place before until my friend told me she wanted to try this place out. So we came on a Saturday for brunch. There was only one woman working in the front. And there were two other tables when we arrived. Us being newbies, we didnt know how it works. So she was really nice and said we can order here so i thought it was gna be a fast food like thing. I had no clue what i wanted so i stood there and she pointed us to the menu. All the food was displayed. And she uncovered everything to explain to us what they have. As i was about to pay, she said pay later, take a seat! Was super patient with us lol  What i ordered:  Breakfast combo   The combo consists of 2 eggs + choice of meat + choice of side + choice of salad + toast. I went for sauage, potato pancake and beet salad. Boy oh boy! The potato pancake was bomb! A little greasy, but the flavor is amazing! Sure do wna come back and try their lunch/dinner menus!!"}
{"text":"I guess reviewing a restaurant after having tried a far more superior one is unfair, but that was what happened with Polka Bistro Caffe.  Let's start off with saying that the food wasn't bad. It's just the service we got and the manner as to how the food was presented/served that I didn't like.  My friend and I entered the restaurant and there was no one to greet us. We walked in and noticed that all the food was kept on chafing plates, but yet no one was standing there to take our orders. After waiting for around 3 minutes a lady finally arrived from the kitchen, didn't look at us and began serving plates for another table, followed by welcoming some other newly arrived customers, who I assume were regulars, since she was very friendly to them. Yet she didn't even acknowledge us once.  Finally, after what felt like 10 minutes, she walked back to the serving area and asked us what we wanted, without attempting to explain the menu. We had no idea what anything in the chafing plates were (vegetarian, meat, etc.).  I didn't bother asking and just ordered what I usually get at Cafe Polonéz (the best polish restaurant in the GTA!), which were the cabbage rolls and a side of perogies (with god knows what filling). My friend is vegetarian so she had the choice of cheese perogies, rice, potatoes, and potato pancakes (which looked too greasy). So she settled for perogies and salad.  I am someone who likes my food to be piping hot, but the fact that the food was sitting there bothered me as I knew it would be served warm/room temperature.  Food review: Cabbage roll: Overly stuffed and gigantic! They weren't bad but I still have no idea what they were stuffed with (beef or pork). Much more larger than what I would get at cafe Polonéz, although not as good, but still tasty with a red sauce.  Perogies: stuffed with cheese, and in my opinion were very delicious!   The salads: I chose the beet salad, sauerkraut, and coleslaw. You can't really go wrong with those.   We didn't get offered any water throughout our meal. The one and only server had left the restaurant to socialize with a friend outside. The price wasn't too bad. Although my friend left with a barely filled stomach. I was stuffed, nevertheless.  So overall, If I'm craving polish food and do not want to drive all the way to Toronto, then I wouldn't mind going back. But I would not recommend this place for vegetarians, or for people who require friendly and attentive service."}
