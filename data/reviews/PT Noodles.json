{"text":"The staff is all super friendly. The atmosphere isnt divey, depending on who else is eating there. I really like their Pho. It is great when you are not feeling well and will most likely leave you feeling better. I always get it with meat but end up getting seconds and thirds of their rice noodles before even touching the meat. The soup is so delicious by itself."}
{"text":"Great place! Tried the bun and the fresh spring rolls and they were great. They also have the Vietnamese baguette sandwiches, something you don't normally see in Vietnamese joints!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the West Valley.  

Weird that they don't have the small dishes to make the sauces for dipping though. 
Instead of asking, I just make do with the plate that comes under the noodles."}
{"text":"I'm from California and finding a pho place is hard to find around here.  under the old management, this place was really good. Great food, service and cleanliness. when I found out about this place going under a new management I was surprised but because I liked it there I figured same name hopefully same service.  I was wrong.  When we got in we were seated at the table and it was dirty, So the lady cleanses it up but made it even worse.  The table was sticky and it had that old water smell. So I had to clean it off with the napkins.  While we sat there waiting for our food, I watched a man clean some tables off with a cloth that he toss into the container of dirty dishes.  I then saw a lady take that cloth and not even wash it in water from the container of dirty dishes and proceed to clean another table. No wonder the table we sat at smelled so bad. Our food came but that just threw me off watching how they cleaned the place. my husband said the pho didnt taste the same as the old management had it and their rice plates lacked meat"}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast last week and the sign on the door says they open at 8AM.   Waited 15 minutes and they still didn't open, we left at 8:10AM.  Today, we came by again, at 8:30AM, door still locked, peeped inside the glass door, not a single person inside.  Wasted my time twice, should update your hours if you intend not to open at 8AM!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good. I'm very picky with Vietnamese food because I'm Vietnamese. Being said, this place has awesome food that make me crave for it more and more. I love their specialties! They are very authentic! I will keep coming back here over and over. So, go get yourself some mouth watering Vietnamese food! Oh, their portion is very generous too."}
{"text":"I have been to PT Noodles a couple of times now. I first found out about this place while I was next door getting a pedicure and talking with my mom about where we should go for dinner. The girls there recommended PT noodles to us. I am so happy they did. Finding a great bowl of Pho can be really hit and miss. But this place was a hit! I order the Pho with the rare steak. The taste of the broth is amazing! It makes my mouth water thinking about it now. The sandwiches are also great! Make sure to finish the meal off with an iced coffee."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good!! Service and food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is friggin bomb sauce ya'll.  So hard to find a legit decent pho place in AZ but this place is awesome.  Broth is key and they do it well here.  Like any good pho spot, the ambiance is a bit lacking but its the quality of the soup that counts and this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I love this place! So happy to have great food on this side of town. Anything on the menu is amazing! I've ordered the spicy beef noodles as well as beef noodles and the consistency is great. The broth is perfect! I would highly recommend. Great, fast service. I do wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food with great service! Definitely a repeat for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"The food tastes so fresh. We did try most on the menu and very impress they all so good. We love to be back again"}
{"text":"I got a negative reaction after eating their food because the menu hadn't stated all the ingredients in their food. on top of that, my meal tasted sour. They get an extra star because the spring rolls were tasty. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"My family goes here 3 times a month and food is great there noodles are great the only problem is i will say staff they eat ryt front of you sometimes and everyone can tell the service is not the best but! Food is great"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.Got the Shrimp Pho.The shrimp were larger than I expected broth for the pho was good.The place has fast service it is small but nice.They also have outside seating which is nice for the weather we are having now.I diffently will be back to try more the rice dishes look good I am going to try that next time.Best I have found this far west.The prices were resonable also."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Vietnamese. Only downside was that the wait was quite long for everything. Went on a Wednesday night and they were packed. Great food, good value. Didn't have the pho as I usually do but had a pork rice dish with pork skins and pork cake. Delicious and filling!"}
{"text":"PT Noodle is P-pretty and T-terrific! Great Pho and polite service make this our new \"go to\" noodle place, flavorful Pho, in an unassuming little place!"}
{"text":"PT is all about authentic, delicious, inexpensive Vietnamese food.     Everything else (ambiance, service, cleanliness) is an afterthought.   Probably the best Pho I've had in the Phoenix metro area.    Very good Banh Mi here as well (all starting with that excellent bread).   Yum."}
{"text":"Very good food.  prices are great for all the food you get. Best place in West Valley"}
{"text":"Come to PT noodles if you are looking for an exotic experience. The menu is difficult to decipher. And the pronunciations of the Vietnamese words... forget about it. The food, well let's just say it's an exotic experience."}
{"text":"The Pho Ga is awesome. I recently tried two different other Vietnamese places and I regretted it. I also enjoy the egg rolls. Quick, reliable food that always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This little gem helped fulfill a pho hankering I've been having on the west side for quite some time. They do a great bowl of pho and have all the other regional favorites like bun bo hue and bun cha. Super friendly and efficient...it's a regular spot for me now."}
{"text":"Um...I'm so so about this place. I'll probably come back because their bun Bo hue is delicious. But their pho is awful. You can't screw up pho if you own a Vietnamese place. So if I come back it'd be for other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you love exotic delicate cuisine, PT noodles is for you.  Great soups with a wild variety of flavors in one bowl.   Leave the hamburger , pasta, pizza, and tacos for one night and take your taste buds for a PT noodles adventure."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place, and it's not too far of a drive from where I live. I had been craving pho for awhile so when I looked this up, my cousin-in-law and I decided to check it out. Loved their spring rolls. I ordered to go once and I was surprised I didn't have to wait that long. Can't wait to return back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past few years and always enjoy the food and service."}
{"text":"We tried PT Noodles tonight for dinner and it was amazing.  Everything as fresh and perfectly cooked.  The staff was friendly and helpful and made the experience really nice.  I would highly recommend eating here to anyone.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"yummy food (i had the pho)! staff are very friendly and attentive. the restaurant is clean too. i don't live in the area so it's difficult to compare it to other venues but it's definitely a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place!
Best pho ever and the spring rolls are always fresh, excellent customer service I will recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is awesome. This time I got the #18, which I thought basically sounded the same as #19, and the price was the same, so I gave it a try. The meat was more what I was looking for, the service was once again amazing, and the portions were just right. The place was packed this time, every table was full."}
{"text":"I love the pho here A + food.  :)   But like every pho restraunt it takes awhile to refill your  drinks....   This is gonna be my new pho place to go!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho in the West Valley. Also very cheap paid under  $8 for my meal. They have quick friendly service definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"quaint and nice.

for price, worth.

would give 3.5 if able

wanna write this down quickly but doesn't need a full review.

pho: broth a bit too tangy and meat mediocre
spring roll: got shrimp and pork, got more veggies but still decent
bahn mi: good. refreshing like a good bahn mi should be. first bite warms up and then the second gets you in the groove it. however if you take a second you realize there is a slight bit too much mayo. otherwise probably my favorite thing there."}
{"text":"Came here to take my youngest son to try pho for the first time. I thought it was decent, he was definitely not a fan. The staff was nice and the service was good, but the cleanliness of the place left a lot to be desired. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Pho. My brother eats here a least once a week when he comes down for the winter!"}
{"text":"This place is fast but give you little food! I ordered a pho soup with chicken and extra shrimp and got 2oz of chicken and 2 shrimp. I will not be going back. They also don't understand English at all! So it was very difficult to communicate with them."}
{"text":"Really crappy food, dirty tables, staff had an attitude when I asked for knife for my steak."}
{"text":"I been here twice and the second time around they over charged me and didn't get my order right."}
{"text":"I'm glad I was able to try this place today! It is really small inside...only a few tables. I went at an off time so there were only a couple other tables taken. The service is definitely awkward, mainly because the workers don't speak English very well. The workers weren't rude or anything, and they jump to their feet when you ask for something.

The food is good though! I tried the pho with steak, tendon, and tripe, and the first com tam dish with the fried egg. Both dishes were flavored and seasoned really well! I was actually surprised at how tasty it was. The thai tea is delicious too...it looks a little than the thai teas I have tried- it is kind of a redish color- but it tastes the same. 

The pricing isn't ridiculously cheap, and the portion sizes are not excessive. However, I think it is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get: around $7 for a bowl of pho and a few more bucks for the rish entrees. The only thing that would be nice is if they had lunch specials like most asian restaurants do. Maybe they do, not entirely sure because I went around three o'clock. 

Overall, the food definitely gives this place a four star rating. I would like to come back and try the bah mi sandwhich!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly servers and pho is consistently good. It's pretty rare for a pho eatery. Lol They need to expand though because it's busy w few seatings."}
{"text":"I Love Love Love Love Love this place!! I can't get enough of their Chicken Pho, I swear I can eat it everyday! And it's right across the street from my work/home. I don't know what I did to deserve that! But this place deserves more than 5stars"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it is with sadness, that I need to downgrade my evaluation of this restaurant.

I don't know whether they've gotten greedy or are being pinched by the competition and/or the economy, but there's a very noticeable difference these days.  The restaurant is still quite crowded; the food hasn't gotten worse.  But in lieu of raising prices, the portions have gotten noticeably smaller (thus, in effect, raising the prices).  Meanwhile, there's less meat in the soups; in the stir frys, and the size of the goi cuon (shrimp rolls) have gotten ridiculously small; to the point they're not much bigger than the typically small fried egg rolls (cha gio).  Add to that the occasional mistake in orders, slower service and nickel and diming on even the most minor of extras and this place no longer is the \"special place\" it once was.  Even the sandwiches, never big to start with, have gotten smaller (and stuffed with more veggies than meat ... guess why!).  In addition, in ye olde days, they used to toast the buns.  Not only do they NOT do that now, but the sandwiches we recently bought were as dry my dog's milk bone (which, ironically, also had more meat than in my sandwich).

Personally, I'd be less offended if they'd simply raise the prices and bring back the bigger portions --- though, if you'd like to get the sized portion you should have gotten, you can order the XL of your dish for another $2.00 ... $2.00, which really shouldn't be charged in the first place.  But, I guess, were they to serve portions comparable to other places at more expensive prices, they'd no longer seem competitive at all.  Either way, I'm out."}
{"text":"I am sooooooo glad I found this place on Yelp!!!  The place is clean, the people are so nice, and the FOOD!!  I got my Bun ( Vietnamese rice noodles) with the beef the first time, pork the second time.  Amazing!!!  They open early, so I can have this for breakfast!  Yahoo!!!  And my mom loves the pho!!  I am so glad this place is near our home.  Definitely check this place out.  You won't be sorry!  I now know where to go for my fix!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very casual and very small place to grab some Pho. The broth is amazing and the vegetables are fresh."}
{"text":"I give it 5 because anyone bringing $7 pho to the west valley is great in my book.  I like to start with the crispy fried rolls and sometimes a banh mi with my pho and I'm all set."}
{"text":"Finally, we got some great Pho noodle soup in Surprise.
My family and I frequented the one near the I-10.
This is closer and larger than that one.
Still brand new and just simple.
The pho is so delicious; and you can season it to your taste.
We like it tangy and spicy. Others may just want it plain; which is still very yummy. I highly recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for their inconsistent service quality. Sometimes the service is excellent and then other times the service can be very frustrating. Whenever I decide to eat here I always make sure I have extra time on my hands to make sure I am not late for anything. The up side is, their food is always fantastic. I guess the wait makes you enjoy it more? I usually order spring rolls(with pork and shrimp: they have two options), Pho or grilled pork over rice vermicelli and Thai tea. It never disappoints. I always want to try something new when I eat here, but I can't get enough of my regular orders. 

This place is far better than the other Vietnamese restaurants around this area. This place is also quite small, so it can get loud."}
{"text":"Great Pho & great service! I had lunch here on break one day, found it accidentally & figured why not? Place was clean, server asked if I've had Vietnamese food before, I confirmed yes but not often & asked her recommendation, she guided me to steak pho, and it was delicious! She also recommended I tear the basil in small pieces to create more fragrance & flavor. Loved the food & service!! I returned for takeout the next night so my husband could try it & my server remembered me, PT Noodles is a welcome addition our West Valley favorites!"}
{"text":"More like \"Shi T noodles\".
Terrible food. Small portions, cheap ingredients. My wife had a seafood noodle dish and it had very little seafood in it. My mix stir fry dish had literally one shrimp in it. The bok choy did not taste fresh. The peanut sauce that came with the rice rolls was highly diluted. Please save yourself the money, and go somewhere else. We tried them after reading some reviews and regretted it."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food as well! Ordered take out and they gave me a water while i waited and the food came out promptly! Banh mi was delicious along with some spring rolls :)"}
{"text":"Not sure where to start with this restaurant. How about the sight of the host/waiter swatting flies with an electric swatter? What was even more shocking was that he sort of walked over and pointed to our table while still swatting the flies. Would've been slightly ok if he at least put it down. And washed his hands of course before handing us our menus.

The smell of the restaurant is pretty bad because it shares a wall with the nail salon next door. Keep in mind, I've grown up with the smells of nail salons and Vietnamese restaurants my whole life.. but never both combined while dining. Strike 2.

We ordered a pho bowl and com tam (broken rice) dish. The pho broth tasted sweet and the meat seemed old. My rice dish came out missing an item. Nothing looked fresh. Everything tasted gross. Strike 3.

Overall it was a disappointing experience. There are not that many choices in terms of Asian food in the West Valley so I can see why people come here. However, I will never miss Vietnamese food so much that I would go here, ever again. Get your fix in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times an food is ok not the best, but only one near my side of town. Today we went for lunch and my husband took one sip of his water and said it tasted funny so I took one big gulp and almost vomit!!! The cup was absolutely filty and had white stuff floating all over them. I mention to the server and she informed me that maybe it was sugar...sugar!!! Really!!! I don't care what was in it they should not bring us water with remains from their last customer! I will never go back to this place again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a total Vietnamese pho fan and this place is amazing. I used to have to drive an hour to east valley just to have good viet pho, until I found this place. I can honest say this is prb the best pho place in the west valley, hands down ! I hope they stay open because I will be back ! I had pho and the hot BBQ sandwich, both excellent choice ! Service was efficient and fast as well. The only down side is they close early, 8:30pm."}
{"text":"On recommendation from my Vietnamese nail tech, I tried this place out.  I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken).  Yummy... it had great taste and hit the spot on a cold Saturday morning... nice size portion for the price... the restaurant is small so be sure to get there early for the best seating."}
{"text":"I'm SO HAPPY to have a place to get pho in Goodyear. When you're feeling a bit ill or down in the dumps, a big bowl of piping hot broth, noodles, meat, veggies and aromatics can soothe your soul. I am a fan of the pho ga, which is their chicken pho, except I also add veggies to the bowl (cabbage, broccoli, and carrots). While I wish the place was bigger and offered more seating, I haven't yet not been able to be seated."}
{"text":"Looking for simple, easy-on-the-wallet dinner?  Look no further.  Their ice tea is clear; egg rolls hot and chicken Pho fresh and tasty.  Not much to look at inside, but your meal is served quick.  Only draw back was the brisket meat used in the Pho, it was pretty fatty.  Other than that, decent food!"}
{"text":"Try the rice crepe and egg rolls... Both great! The place is clean, the help attentive... WhT more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Decent bowl of pho on the west side.  Chunks of chopped green onions in the broth are a nice, non-standard addition. They even took a special order and tarted up my iced tea with some mint leaves."}
{"text":"Yum yum! First time here today and I was quite pleased. This is the third place I've gone to eat Vietnamese good and so far this is the best to me. It's small but it's nice and clean. Ordered an appetizer of the pork and veggies egg roll. Delicious. Played it save and just got some Pho with beef. A friend got a store fry platter and it was good to her too! Definitely coming back and trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"Really good but my chicken for my pho was really dry. Without moisture completely. I was surprised because everything else was good   
I had the meatballs added and I'm glad I did since I didn't like the chicken. The peanut sauce was yummy. Hoping to try a different soup next time. Yes I said next time. 
One thing I would like to know if they use MSG in anything they serve??"}
{"text":"I love the Customer service provided always quick and to the point. Orders do not take too long and the food is great. I've only tried the pho and banh mi but definitely prefer the sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been craving Pho since I moved to the West Valley.  After reading reviews I decided to try out PT Noodles.  We started off with the pork and shrimp spring rolls, an order of two with a sweet yet spicy peanut sauce.  Next I ordered the Pho with Beef and my boyfriend ordered a combination of Beef/Chicken/Shrimp.  As all Pho lovers know it really is about the broth and this was very tasty, well seasoned and not too salty.  The pho was not over-powered with noodles and a good amount of protein.  We will be back for more!

My only complaint is that they turn the A/C up a little."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight.  The food was ok, we got our food pretty fast, but follow up wasn't too good.  There was a loud whining noise from the back that went on for 15 minutes or so.  When that was over, there was a burning smell.  Not terribly appetizing.

I may try it again to see if the soup is ok.  My wife won't."}
{"text":"Usually really good shrimp noodle soup. However, last time we went the chicken was tough and tasted awful. The service could be better, they don't check on you or bring you beverages when you run out. You literally have to get up and go ask them for anything. Overall it's a good little place to stop for a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had anywhere! There are many places that try, but I'm not aware of any Vietnamese restaurant better than this one. I get the shrimp and brisket Pho. Delicious! Comes with rice noodles, cilantro, jalapeño, bean sprouts, basil, and two different sauces, one spicy and one not. All delicious!"}
{"text":"It is a very small place, during rush hours, don't expect to get a seat or it inside. They're Pho is amazing though I introduce this place to all my friends. The staff is friendly and the food is great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Tried it again and things were very clean and tidy. Food was awesome as usual and the owners are great people. Best Pho place in the area and can't get enough of PT Noodles.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the rice, pork chop, and shredded pork dish.  Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, it's above par.  Compared to other bigger cities like Houston, L.A., NY probably 3, 3.5 stars.  The flavor was good, but the menu lacked variety.  Simplicity can be a good thing, too, though.

Next time, I want to try their Pho.  I just felt like rice and meat today but the true test of a good Vietnamese restaurant is the Pho broth!"}
{"text":"This is a small gem that serves good Pho for the West Valley.  While only seating 6-7 tables, the prices are fair and the Pho base is flavorful enough to compel repeat business.  Although the atmosphere and decor are lacking- I believe you won't be disappointed if you are a true Pho lover and are looking for a local place."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here pretty much every week. The customer service and food is great! I highly recommend PT noodle!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for a good bowl of Pho Thai! I've missed this from my SoCal roots."}
{"text":"Decent food & speedy service. I'd say this is the best place to go in the Avondale/Goodyear area if you want Vietnamese food. 

I think their rice dishes are better than any of their soup dishes. Bo Luc Lac is pretty good and pork shop and rice is good!"}
{"text":"PT Noodles has the best pho in AZ! Way better than Pho House. They even have a vegetarian option and the service is phenomenal! You could dine-in or take out and you could even order over the phone. If you dine-in, they give you the option to eat outside or inside. The only bad thing about this place is that it's pretty small and usually busy but that's because it's so good!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with this place... Food was flavorless... And the service was sooooo sloooow!!! Took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Vietnamese food in the West valley.  The Bo luc lac is the best I've had yet. The place is small and can be busy in the evenings but the food is worth waiting for"}
{"text":"We happen upon this place when visiting someone in the hospital located fairly close to this restaurant.  The people I was with and myself got different varieties of Pho.
Positive: The people who work there are very nice and the prices are really good.  The Pho was pretty amazing but I did wish there was more mushrooms in the veggie Pho.
Negative: The space is really small and I can see you having to wait a long time if it were really busy."}
{"text":"HOLY PHO!!!  In my 5 years on Yelp, I have handed out only a few 5 stars but I can give no reason why this place doesn't deserve it.  The irony is I am in this parking lot at least 2 times a week to shop at Target.  I have seen the \"PT noodles\" sign many times and made the fatal mistake of assuming.  DO NOT ASSUME!!!  Just because this is in-between a Starbucks and a nail salon doesn't mean it isn't EPIC!  I will recount why it is amazing in 10 quick reasons.  

1-The menu is in Vietnamese first, English second.

2-The hostess and the waiter/chef both made small talk with me and my 3 children even though they speak very little English.

3-They asked a lot of questions to make sure we knew how odd the food we were ordering was.

4-The food literally came out in 10 minutes.  Maybe even less!

5-The restaurant, though a hole-in-the-wall was clean and inviting.

6-LOW prices and HUGE portions!

7-Prompt and friendly service.  When I asked for something, I had it in seconds.
8-Awesome sauces (hoisin, chili, etc.)

9-Did I mention really good service?

10-I guess I have to spell it out.  The food was INCREDIBLE.

I am proud of myself for making it through this whole review without cursing.  The place was just so (*&%$#$%^&) good.  Bottom line, do it!  You will not regret!"}
{"text":"Great food, but place seemed dirty. Glass in front door was filthy, napkin holder and pepper shaker on table were also filthy. Hopefully the kitchen is clean. I had the chicken pho, which was a huge portion, and delicious. Hubby had a stir fry with chicken, beef and shrimp, which he loved. He also loved the pork and shrimp eggrolls. I wouldn't bother ordering soda again, as it's 1.75 and you get a can of it. No fountain drinks with refills. Would definitely go back for the food..hopefully will be cleaner next time."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in the west valley. No matter what your taste buds you will find something here that is delicious! If you are skeptical trying this new cuisine try the bbq chicken sandwich. I personally love the ribeye and the bbq pork and noodles"}
{"text":"The absolute best Pho!! My sister and I have lunch dates here once a week. Never had a bad bowl! Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The shrimp spring rolls were good as was the sauce. 

I got the spicy beef and pork soup. It was good, not great. HUGE portion I only ate about 1/3 of it. It had some weird square things in there that I think were blood tofu or something, I tasted one, not much flavor, I just didn't care to eat it.

The man got the crispy fried noodles with veggies and beef. The noodles were very small noodles and deep fried all the way through, not what we imagined. It was good, but needed more sauce as some of it was a little dry.

I'm unsure if I would go back."}
{"text":"So I didn't actually eat here but I wanted to share anyway. 

I had a business meeting this morning and the Starbucks tables were not only full but not large enough for what I needed.  Since it was 9:45am, I figured they were closed to I sat at their tables.  While we were sitting there the waiter came out to take our order and I immediately felt bad and asked if we could just sit here.  He was really nice and said it was fine.  About 10 min later another waitress brought us water even though she knew we weren't ordering anything.  Customer service goes a long way, especially since they could have asked us not to take up their tables.  My husband and I are going to have to try eating here sometime."}
{"text":"Ate at the Surprise location on Litchfield Road. First time patron. Guaranty it won't be the last time. Six of us dined. The freshest ingredients are used. Wonderful tasting food brought to your table piping hot. Young, energetic, highly effective servers did an exemplary job. When all six people order different meals, and everyone is euphoric, that says something. They don't cut corners here. Just great food at reasonable prices. You'll leave happy...not hungry!"}
{"text":"Tasty beef pho. The noodles weren't anything to write home about - not that I expected them to be fresh and made in-house - but the broth was exactly what I want from pho. The tofu spring rolls were uninspired: essentially lettuce and tofu."}
{"text":"What can I say, took the family here tonight and  it did not disappoint!! Prices were real reasonable and the food was delicious!!! Inside interior is nothing spectacular but the service and food far made up for it. The wifey, 2 of the kiddos and myself all had the Pho and my oldest daughter had some kind of steak with rice and a over easy egg. The egg rolls were real good and we normally drive to Da Vang in Phoenix and noticed they weren't as greasy. It's nice to find a good Vietnamese restaurant on the West Side and we'll definitely be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The service was great; our server was so sweet and attentive- you could really tell he wanted us to enjoy ourselves. I haven't had Vietnamese food very often, so I'm pretty unfamiliar. That being said, I pretty much just picked a random meal off of the menu (#50) and hoped that I'd like it. Luckily, it was quite delicious! Pork, rice noodles, an egg roll, cilantro, lettuce, and more- all in a bowl, with a sauce to mix into it. It was so good and tasted very fresh and healthy! I also ordered the pork spring rolls which were really tasty as well. Dipped in that peanut sauce...mmm mmm. And you can never go wrong with Thai Iced Tea! Not to mention the prices were really reasonable and they give you huge portions! I got to eat my meal for lunch AND dinner. Always a plus."}
{"text":"I feel ripped off, I came to this restarant expecting really good Vietnamese food and we were severly disappointed.  We had a spring roll, Pho and a Bami sandwich.  All disappointing the broth for the pho really didn't have the flavor I've come to expect when having pho. Basically all the food was lacking in flavor.  There are other, better options in the west valley."}
{"text":"Good phoood, awesome service. I always go with the pho tai and shrimp spring rolls, pretty general but they never screw it up, always delicious and comes out fast."}
{"text":"Jackson is the Man!!! 
This guy recommended Filet Mignon on the skillet 
Shit FLAME AS F****
Service on point 
Food on point 
Other pho places wack 
This place FLAME 
NEXT TIME OR WHEN YOU VISIT 
Attention!!! please seek out for JACKSON 
got swag like MOFO"}
{"text":"The Pho here is excellent every time.So are the fresh rolls.The service is always friendly.I love this place,one of two great Pho places in the valley."}
{"text":"yes yes yes! 

we were waiting patiently, watching this location get remodeled everyday on our way to the gym. we were so happy something awesome was going i. this very under used spot. finally the grand opening. 

1. the atmosphere is amazing. they did an excellent job on the decor and the remodel. very impressed. 5 stars. 

2. the wait staff was very attentive and super friendly. 5 stars

3. the food: was exactly what we hoped for!! we ordered the shrimp spring rolls, pork spring rolls, the combo meat pho xl and the bbq pork bunh mi. the rolls were a great size. my favorite was the pork roll which was packed with flavor. the bunh mi was perfect! the bread was nice and crispy on the outside, while tender in the middle. the pork was very flavorful but light on the portion. the aioli and vegetable accompaniment pulled the entire sandwich together. now for the pho, we ordered the XL size for 2 dollars. the broth was incredible. the meat selection was very tasty. the brisket was tender, the tripe was the perfect cut size, the steak was a nice and thin, the meatball... well my other half took all the meatballs and didn't leave me anything. he said they were really really good. thanks for sharing keith. ;)  5 stars. 

overall, would we go back! DUH! heck yah we would. you have to just hate amazing food and a great price. looking forward to trying out their  selection of shakes and other menu items. 

a must go."}
{"text":"This place is pho good!!  So happy to find a place with good pho in the west valley. 

We tried the tofu spring rolls, a veggie/tofu pho and the hubs got the spicy soup. I can't remember it's name. All was very tasty! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great new place, close to home.  Good selection of fresh offerings at reasonable prices.  While this may not have been a place i would have gone on my own (not a huge Vietnamese food fan, but the wife is) I was able to find great options for my enjoyment and enjoy going back for sure."}
{"text":"So far I've tried three versions of their pho. The broth for all of these were tasty, if a bit subdued in flavor compared to that in other pho restaurants that I've tried. The proteins in the pho dac biet were standard: beef slices, tendon, tripe, meatball - all good, not phenomenal. The chicken in the pho ga had a previously cooked then frozen taste, and so this pho was my least favorite pho for this restaurant; the beef brisket pho I ordered during another visit tasted fresher. 

I also tried two of their spring rolls; each spring roll order is generous enough to make a light meal in itself. The shrimp and pork spring rolls are a good choice if you are not ordering a noodle dish because its stuffing has rice noodles in addition to the shrimp, pork, and lettuce. The grilled sausage spring rolls were really flavorful, with a filling of tasty Vietnamese sausage slices, fresh lettuce and herbs, and what seems to be a crispy fried noodle to give it a delightful crunch.

Service is efficient, the servers are very friendly, and there is a button on each table that you press to summon your server. The restaurant is spacious, very clean, has a contemporary Asian vibe, and is very conveniently located in the commercial center on the northwest corner of Camelback and 7th Avenue, just steps away from the Melrose stop of the light rail."}
{"text":"Vegetarian paradise! I love their vegetarian broth pho with tofu, it's huge! Super yummy!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Great tasting food and affordability.  If you like Vietnamese this is the best I have found in the west valley.  Not fancy decor however food makes up for simple atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good pho, small location - would be nicer if they expanded a bit but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try this restaurant for the first time. Did check their menu out on their web site to become familiar with what they had to offer. My husband noticed they did not have pork fried rice on the menu which is his favorite, but Sun checked with the kitchen and she advised there would be no problem in accommodating our request. I ordered the Soft Rice/Egg Noodles with chicken, beef, shrimp and veggies. Everything was fresh and tasty. Sun was exceptional in helping us order from the menu and describing different items. We did not care for the ice tea and replaced them with sodas. There was no charge for the ice tea and not only that, but we were given two small bowls of their soup for a taste test. Now that is customer service!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho great price great service! Very accommodating to my vegetarian request. Veggie Pho and Veggie Salad rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and it was really good. Crushed some awesome eggrolls as an appetizer and then had the Spicy Beef/Pork Noodle Soup (Pho)....was delicious. My girlfriend had the veggie pho and loved it as well. The service was awesome, everyone was working together and were super friendly and welcoming. Really good spot and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Best food ever, their Pork sandwiches are to die for, and there #54 is delicious. Love coming to this place for lunch all the time..."}
{"text":"Never having had Pho I stopped in not really knowing what to expect but expecting to order Pho.  Well, I didn't order Pho.  What I got was, Hu Tieu Nam Vang.  When I ordered the server asked me if I wanted it served American style or Vietnamese style, I bravely stated Vietnamese!  He proceeded to ask me at least three more times to make sure I was absolutely positive with my decision.  I was a little uneasy during the wait, because it seemed to me that he was trying to convince me to change my mind.  What had I gotten myself into?!?  A bowl of fantastic is what I got myself into, that's what!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place - pho is delicious and the staff are friendly and personable. Haven't had a bad meal here and they will do anything to make your meal great. Good people - wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Tried their PHO for the first time. The place is small but clean. The staff were very nice. Only had the pho and the Vietnamese spring roll and liked the flavor. The broth is very flavorful but they do not put a lot of meat and noodles in the pho. I got used to the Pho places in LA where they gave you a lot of stuff for a cheap price and taste amazing."}
{"text":"I was excited to say the least when I saw the Yelp listing for PT Noodles. I'm Visiting  here in Goodyear for a few days and using Yelp to find the best food. Reading many enthusiastic reviews and loving Pho like I do, this was a no brainier. 

I was greeted by smiling new friends upon entering. They make you feel right at home. This small soup shop was sure to meet my expectations.  We ordered Vietnamese coffee and a Coke for my wife.  I ordered #23 Beef Pho noodles and my wife a spicier version. Banh Mi was requested along with fried Spring rolls. Fast service had us sampling the soups in no time. With Pho it's all about the broth. These were both a magical mixture of spices and beef designed to satiate your inner Pho desires. Both were a dream. Tons of fresh herbs and lime made these two entrees truly something to write home about.  Not many times have I exchanged money for lunch and went away that satisfied. 

PT Noodles is the perfect little Pho Shop right in Goodyear AZ. I'm certainly glad Yelp helped me find it."}
{"text":"Saw the place while shopping near by and decided to give it a try. Was crowded and all the tables were full. No problem, we were going to get take out anyway. We ordered some Pho, a Bahn Mi and the crispy fried chicken. The food was nothing special. The bahn mi had almost nothing in it, it was a large baguette with two slices of cucumber a strip of meat, a couple of carrot shreds and some herb leaves. The Pho looked promising but as stated by others, they mix the sweet and spicy together, didn't want the spicy at all. The Pho was ok at best. We ended up throwing the chicken out after a couple bites as it tasted funky. 
We are VERY glad we didn't finish the chicken. My husband and I have been paying the price. I had to call out of work 2 days in a row from being so sick and dehydrated. My husband has fared a little better than me but not by much. We will not ever be going here again. Even if we hadn't gotten sick the food wasn't worth it. The sick just put the final nail in the coffin."}
{"text":"Disappointed.
3.5 stars

Pros: 
I had high hope for this place. I like the fact that the owner cares enough for details and went out of their ways to create a nice environment by being ceeative. Huge plus.

I also like the idea of being able to get service by simply ringing the bell. Granted I can see this being annoying in busy days because everytime someone hit the button, it loudly announce which table needs assistance.

I tried this place more than once and their Service so far has been friendly and helpful. 

Cons:
The food is nothing to brag about.
If i was to spend 6.99 for 4 egg rolls, I expect it to taste better than something I can get for cheaper in a \"hole in the wall\" place.

That is just an example. I tried several dishes from basic fried rice, bbq to pho and honestly none of them compel me to go back. I keep hoping to find something I really like but so far all it did is hurt my wallet and made me regret my visit. I dont mind spending money if I know it is worth it.

There is plenty other restaurant in the area where you spent less and get better quality of food. In my opinion, this place is more look than substance.

Also I grew up in Asia so yes I'm prob more critical than someone who has never travel there and had authentic Asian food. Others may find this place good.

I recommend giving this place a try yourself. Just dont expect much like I did."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The pho is really good. The workers are nice. I recommend going here:)"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not my last!  Super fast service, even faster food.  It's just around the southern corner of the target complex."}
{"text":"I been going to PT noodles for awhile now, and I have tried most of the Vietnamese main corse, from dry and soup base food. The reason I'm rating it 4 star it's cause out of all the dishes I tried I only like 1 of their dishes,  And that would be the fried rice with fried chicken. The soupy for ex; pho, bun bo hue, I think they put too much MSG, after word I would get a head high and drink a lot of water through out the whole day. Quality of soup base I think it just depends on what day you go on, tag along with that usually when you order any soup base food they would bring out a small plate of herbs/greens. What sadden me is I love alot of herbs in my soup but they give you so very little herbs/green onions, not enough for 2 people! The servers here are friendly and fast, and they don't check up on you a lot while your eating (which is a thumbs up because I don't like to be bothered while eating) All and all, this place is a decent place to go to around Avondale area if your craving for some Vietnamese food! I would recommended this place, over any other places around their area:)"}
{"text":"Really good pho in the west valley. Banh mi are also very as well as their other dishes. Small spot so it may be difficult to seat at times but we've never had a problem. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"The place is nothing fancy but decent service and good food.  My mom had the vegetarian soup here.  It was loaded with fresh vegetable and was very tasty.  I had the iced coffee, which was delicious.  I would recommended trying the iced coffee and soup.  Cant speak for the other dishes although the place is pretty popular stays busy."}
{"text":"Best Pho on the west side. The broth has a very rich flavor. Right price. Good service. The rest of the menu is a reason for us to come back."}
{"text":"Great pho, fresh ingredients. Wish the would blanch the noodles first with to go orders. The spring rolls are amazing, my faves are the curry chicken spring roll or the shrimp. Havent tried anything else. Staff is polite, manager is always present, smiling and serving."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars if you live near PT Noodles, but 4 if you don't mind travelling a little further for pho. They are 5 minutes from my house, so they are perfect for a quick fix.

Recently, I noticed that PT Noodles revamped their broth a bit. Its flavor is a bit stronger and a hint sweeter. The meat in their pho is good, as I usually prefer getting meatballs and tendon, but they all are cooked well. Upgrading for a large, or extra noodles, is only $1 more, and it is the difference of me feeling full and me wanting to grab a banh mi on the side.
The Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) here is fairly cheap, tastes fresh, and has a really delicious, crispy French bread. All of those flavors are delicious, but I can't help but add Sriracha to them for a kick.
I also sometimes order the broken rice dishes, which are general a good choice if you don't want soup and love having a variety of sides.
Lastly, I like ordering their avocado shakes, which are freshly made, are perfectly sweet, and comes with option boba. They sometimes have that kind of icey-ness to them, which I love, but are great with or without.

I dislike mentioning other restaurants in reviews to compare, but I have to say before PT came about, there was only King Eggroll in this area. PT Noodles is many times better than King Eggroll. However, it has a long way to match my favorite pho restaurant, Da Vang in Phoenix. I'll keep coming back though, to support the growth of this new establishment, and the extremely kind workers (maybe owners?) who run this place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Pho places.  We try to go about twice a month.  Great staff.  One day we will venture off the menu, but until then #23 with order of fried spring rolls.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pho!! Service is a little spotty and meat could be better quality but overall good broth and good add ins!!"}
{"text":"This morning I had a craving for Pho and didn't feel like driving to Pho-Avina half way across town and so I thought i'd give this place a try. 

This place is clean and has it's A health inspection rating at the front. I ordered the meatball and filet Pho. It came out in a reasonable amount of time and was pretty good. Everything with the fixings came out fresh looking and nothing looked off. Pho was great and I gotta say i'm happy to have found this place. 

My only complaint was the service was a little inattentive and slow. When I walked in I stood at the front long enough to browse their entire menu, looked around, and finally sat myself with a menu until someone noticed I was there. I may have missed how this place was supposed to work, so I can't really hold it against them on my first trip, but hopefully it's a little better next time."}
{"text":"I've run in for lunch take-out here several times and I'm always very happy with my food. Prices are good. I've tried the big thick noodles (stir fry) with egg, shrimp, and vegetables once ( I wish I could remember what they are called but I can't.) And I've had pho (noodle/soup) a couple of times too. Very tasty. Very friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"I have no idea if the food is good. It sure looked tasty however we no sooner sat down and barely opened the menu when we were practically accosted by an extremely RUDE waiter asking if we were ready! I asked if we could have a minute and he replied forcefully, you need to hurry our kitchen is closing. At that point we walked out unable to enjoy neither the experience nor the food. WE WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Service was great and my food came out quick. I got the combination pho bowl and the VN coffee. I was craving noodle soup and it def hit the spot! highly recommend it if you are in the area! I went during lunch time and it was fairly busy."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times & it's always delicious. I will say this is the only place I've ever had pho, so I don't have anything to compare it to. They give you a ton of food for your money. I got taste a little bit of their lemongrass chicken stir fry off my dad's plate one time, and it was very good as well. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"These people that gave the place a 5-star review presumably never been to a good Vietnamese restaurant. The food was just OK, the place is really small."}
{"text":"Boyfriend loves it and I love it! Great food and yummy fresh coconuts! Everything we have tried so far has been delicious! Don't be afraid to try something new."}
{"text":"I thought the ambiance was nice and clean. Staff is friendly. I ordered the PT BBQ that has pork, grilled shrimp, and grounded shrimp with bean curd skin. It came with a chicken based broth soup. I asked the waiter what was in the broth and he said chicken. It tasted and smelled fishy. The grilled pork was also over cooked and fishy; however, the grilled shrimp was not and was basically the only thing I found edible on my plate. I also tried the vegetable curry. The sauce is tasty but nothing to really write home about. Meh. I'll be back to try the Pho and spring rolls but I'm definitely not in a hurry."}
{"text":"The Pho here is exceptional. Easy going atmosphere and good for a quick bite. The Pho portion is substantial and staff is friendly. Our server brought us some tea samples to try, which was an added bonus. Being a west valley chain I've tried a couple locations and was happy with each experience. I keep telling myself that I will branch out and try a different item on the menu, but find myself not able to turn down the Pho! Pay them a visit when a noodle soup craving hits you. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. I only get the Pho to go and they separate everything for you so that can create your bowl. The restaurant is small and plain but that's not an issue. If you are trying PHo for the first time eat it there as like I said above everything is separated in the to go order. Their spring rolls are great. I'd like a larger variety of them."}
{"text":"I usually go to pho tan but this is something a little nicer with better kinder service. The management is great as well as service. I had the shrimp egg rolls they wear divine, wrapped in whole with tail giving an upscale food forward experience with an amazing orange dipping sauce. For my entree I kept it pretty generic and basic and just had the orange chicken... it was amazing and hearty I loved the mayo aioli on top. I even grabbed a bbq chicken bun mi Togo to have later. It was so nice to be acknowledged on my way out with kind goodbyes...and thank you's... I'll definitely be back gotta try the boba next time."}
{"text":"Three of us went there for lunch today.  We really enjoyed the food.  We had shrimp and pork spring rolls, shrimp pho', beef pho', seafood stirfry.  The hot food actually came out hot!  Prices are reasonable and there are large portions.
Service is very, very, very  slow.  The place could really use a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here to get some food quickly and the lady who served me was so great.
Their food is sooooo delicious too. I ordered to go so I didn't get the full experience but I think the taste of everything speaks loudly.
Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin... I absolutely love this place. The food is excellent! My favorite of course is the Pho Soup with Chicken and Shrimp. I literally could eat here every single day and I wouldn't get sick of it! The only other things I have tried is the fried rice and eggs roll which are very good as well. If I did have 1 negative thing to say is about the flies... every single time the front door opens (which is often, because everyone wants to eat there) the flies come in with the customers too. But otherwise Yummy!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing!!! Food is amazing! I had the the combo fried noodles and I could not get enough.  My husband had Pho....and it hurt him not to finish it lol. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have never experienced such rude customer service. That's sucks because the food was actually pretty good. It took them 16 minutes to acknowledge us after we waked in. After we were finished with our meal I asked for the check and the serve6continued to help others. Will mot be back at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wife and I eat 2 or 3 times a month here,staff is super knowledgable,food is fresh,place is clean as a whistle.Dont listen to any debbi downers try it for yourself.Prices are great,bathrooms are clean,enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new so we came here and I'm glad we did. They have seating in and out of the restaurant, the inside was a full house.  The menu selection was great if I could being my first time here lol I'd order everything, just to try it haha what was even more fabulous is they had Taro boba my favorite!! I've been to a few boba places here in Phx and I must say the Taro boba here is the best yet. Our order didn't take long to come out and mann it was deelicious! Great Customer service. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"The pho is pho real. Really good food for a minimal price. They also give a military discount. Their Vietnamese sandwiches are pretty decent. Place is cramped so don't bring a huge party."}
{"text":"Pho pretty good. Also got the mixed chicken and beef satay with rice noodles. Downside, prices are way to high. It's about $2-$3 more than most pho places.   :("}
{"text":"We're a regular whenever we're craving for some good food. Especially try there pho & bun no hue. Not expensive at all, reasonable price compare to other Vietnamese shop. Owners are nice, they Dont talk much. But there always asking if we're doing okay or if we need anything. So thumbs up ! Kinda weird location because its around the corner next to Starbucks and a nail salon. Very small shop though. So if your planning on bringing over 10 people & you guys wanna sit together. Might be a problem. They probably have only mmmm 8 tables. So plan ahead I guess. Other than that, go for there soup dishes"}
{"text":"So happy this place finally opened! In the outside it doesn't look more then a tiny hole in the wall but walking in I was amazed. Its spacious and really nice inside. Our waiter was really nice and joked with us. So we felt comfortable. We ordered a Vietnamese coffee which was really good. For our meal we had the butter chicken wings which were good but They could've been a little more crispy. Then I ordered the Pho Tai nam and that was amazing! The pho here is really good and I can't wait to come back! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Excellent Pho and egg rolls.  Service was prompt and helpful.  Will return next time I'm in Goodyear."}
{"text":"My family and I came here after my little brother and sister's graduation. The food was delicious and our server was funny and super attentive. Our food came out fast and hot. I ordered the BBQ ribeye with and egg and a side of rice. It was fantastic. I can't wait until I'm in that part of town again so I can grab another bite. :)"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a young coconut. Found this place on Yelp, of course. Um... I won't ever eat here. I walked in to grab two coconuts and waited a bit which is understandable. They have to cut the cocos open. Anyway, the place is right. The walls are a weird pistachio color which makes everyone in there look green. Not particularly the best color to make food look appetizing. Also, the place was very humid and the floors were very dirty.  Everything looked sticky.  No thanks.   If I was rating the coconuts individually I would give it 5 stars. Other than that.... Sadly I'm giving this place a one star based on first impression alone.   :("}
{"text":"The first time I ever tried Vietnamese food (several years ago in Tucson) I was impressed by the complexity of the spices. But I wasn't really hooked. Then, a few years ago, my girlfriend introduced me to PT Noodle and re-acquainted me with Vietnamese food. I'm hooked.

Even in the dead of summer, a big bowl of Pho sounds good because the quality and freshness of the ingredients is impressive. If you doubt the power of first impressions, understand this. I still remember the conversation between my girlfriend and I about the freshness of the produce and the quality of the proteins. For this reason alone, we have been regular customers ever since.

While she is a creature of habit here, I decided to venture off and try something different on our recent visit. We've enjoyed the spring rolls before, and they're excellent! They are a delicious start to a meal on a hot summer night.

It doesn't matter if you're a Pho traditionalist, or enjoy other rice or noodle creations, the flavors are always incredible. Oh, and the Pho is so filling. It's a generous portion. But this time, my Rice Vermicelli (Bun) was deliciously seasoned and garnished. Some of the entrees here are just too pretty to eat.

The employees at PT Noodle are always so friendly and helpful. It doesn't matter if you're dining in or grabbing some carry out. And thanks to the numerous options (including sandwiches and salads) and our favorite Pho, we will be happy guests at PT Noodle for years to come."}
{"text":"The egg rolls, sweet chicken and noodles were very good.  We stopped here without looking it up."}
{"text":"I will NEVER Return. The service was horrible. I had some nasty white stuff in my drink and told them I have a food allergy and jokingly said \"ill die\" and still got Shimp on my meal. They took it back and never said sorry or acknowledged their error. In there defense it was busy and maybe I got them on a bad day. Ill tell you though, I will not be giving them another chance to \"kill me\""}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's in my top 3. Which I am reconstructing right now. But when I got here, I noticed it was kinda small. It was a little claustrophobic for my taste. The tables are a little closer together than I would want.. and unfortunately there was a mother with a screaming child behind me that was driving me nuts. Not that, that is their fault though. But that sucked having to hear a screaming child behind me while I'm trying to have conversation and enjoy my meal. No one wants to hear that. But as soon as the pho came out, it smelled amazing. That was the first thing I noticed, was the smell. I knew then that it was gonna taste good and that they probably soak theirs well in the seasonings. And for sure it was really yummy. So I have to give them that!! The service was good and quick. I just wish they had more room. But I think people should give this a try!!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers, delicious flavors, good quality, and good service. Crispy chicken with fried rice, vegetable pho, Vietnamese crepe all delicious. They also have a great selection of boba drinks and really good Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"This rating is based more on the service than the food. Yesterday I ordered take out. I ordered three dishes. What I got was two dishes and one of them was wrong. I should have checked when I picked up the order, but I am not use to having to check on such things. Arriving home I found the error and called. Part of the excuse was, \"you did no pay of three dishes\". Yea, that is correct and if I had, I would really be pissed. But, I ordered three and each was specific, what I got was two and one was not what I ordered. I did not want to drive all the way back. The food is OK to good, but with that kind of service (it could be a language problem, but I doubt it) I will certainly not order by phone again. Probably go there so I can see what is coming out and what I am paying for."}
{"text":"pho on fleek as the kids would say. Solid ingredients, good flavors, simple yet satisfying."}
{"text":"Five stars because I always come back for more pho! I am so glad that there's a Viet restaurant in town and I 100% recommend you going here as I bring all of my friends!"}
{"text":"I am beside myself that this gem cane to our area!!! Great service and delicious clean food!!! I don't have to write alot, this spot speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This place is as yummy as it gets when I am craving Vietnamese food like Pho! Their pho broth is just as good as my moms and that says a lot coming from a person that doesn't bother ordering pho at Viet restaurants. However! I find myself starting to order pho more and more every time I come to this restaurant which is at least 3-4 times a month. Their fried rice w/cornish hen (fried chicken) is also a good choice if you don't feel like eating pho. When I am really hungry I also order a Banh Mi sandwich w/bbq pork! Can't go wrong with ordering that as an appetizer and it also makes for a good snack when you get home. This place is owned by a husband and wife. I def support small-business just like this establishment, I will continue telling all my friends to come here when they want good, authentic Vietnamese food on the \"west-side.\" Service is good and fast, so no complaints there!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Phonatic! I've been to a lot of pho restaurants and this one is in my top three. As I was walking in yesterday there was a gentleman eating an enormous bowl of pho on the dog friendly patio! The largest bowl I've ever seen!!! I was told it was their XL! 

I had the MD rare Pho $7.50: broth was well balanced and amazing. I always add everything they give you with and add chili oil and chili paste for a kick!

Also the BBQ Pork Banh Mi for only $4!!! I could eat those all day! Must try! Strongly suggest dipping in broth... it's a phogasm lol! 

I'm glad Pho is starting to pick up in trend. Every time I take someone that's never had it ends up loving it... and if they didn't.. no longer friends!"}
{"text":"Not for me

I stopped by PT Noodles to grab a quick bite to eat. I ordered an eggroll and beef fried rice. The restaurant was crowded, not much room, not much verbal contact with owners or waitstaff. 

The tables around us were left dirty which was a bit of a turn off.  PT Noodles is a small place so you're quite close to your neighbors.     

On this visit we had eggrolls and Beef Stir Fried Rice. The beef stir fried rice was tasteless. The strips of thin sliced beef was tough and overcooked. It seemed as if the beef was pre-cooked and then added to the rice, we left more then half on our plates.  As for the eggroll, it was just okay.  

Was disappointed with the meal. I Wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pho place - and we are so glad it is close to our house. The cha gio are excellent and the bun Bo hue is to die for. I always order it with no meat and extra noodles and they are happy to oblige. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I went for lunch there yesterday after a co-worker told me about this place (the same day- I just had to go and try it).  I had the eggroll's and the steak pho.  The eggroll's were delicious and the plate of two was just enough for one person.  I was really impressed with the pho though.  I have tried almost ever pho place in the valley from Avondale, surprise, Glendale, downtown phoenix, and Scottsdale and I have to say that this place had some great flavors.  The broth had a very rich taste that was not overpowering like other places. It came with all the necessary add-ons but what really impressed me was the steak they used. It seemed to have a mix of slice beef and brisket which was smooth and tender.  I have to go again to see if this place is consistent but if it anything like yesterday then I will become a regular"}
{"text":"I work at a salon down the street from here and this is one of our favorite places to order from. We do pho Friday's and it's the best day of the week. The girls and I love the vegetarian pho, pho special, shrimp and pork fresh spring rolls, Thai tea boba and Thai coffee boba. Service is fast and friendly and the restaurant it always nice and clean."}
{"text":"My first experience at this place started out kinda ruff. Got sat down and waited for at least 10mins to place a order. Not to mention I haven't even been served a glass of water at least. Needles to say I had to get up and let the server that was sitting at a table on his phone, that I was ready to place a order. So basically service would be a one star. Food was okay...so I would give it a 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"Some bomb pho... better than any other place in the valley. Order out is a good option here as well."}
{"text":"Read the reviews so decided to check out PT's.  The small dining room was so hot.  They don't use A/C.  Service wasn't great but I don't usually expect much service when I eat Vietnamese.  

I ordered the vermicelli noodle with egg roll and grilled pork.  The bowl was big.  A lot of noodles and veggies...but only three little cut pieces of egg roll and barely any meat.  

Flavor was good but I was hungry an hour later.  I would recommend paying extra and doubling the protein."}
{"text":"We live relatively close to PT Noodles and have always passed this place but never tried it. We decided to try it today coz we were by Target and dont have much time before our next appointment. We were so pleasantly surprised! Everybody was nice and friendly and the food was great! TWe definitely will be coming back a lot more."}
{"text":"Place was ok for pho fried rice very plain and over filled with onions and vegetable over all won't go again"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pho.  Best in the valley I've had.  Jordan was exceptionally helpful.   The egg rolls are crunchy and served very hot.  The BBQ pork chop was tender and sweet.  The pho bone broth tastes like it's been cooked for hours like it should.  It has a sweetness that goes well with the brisket.  The prices are very reasonable including bahn mi and the boba.  The weird wall lobsters made me laugh."}
{"text":"I'm here at least twice a week, only order one thing..... pho! Best in the west fasho!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years now. I recommend this place to anyone who is on the west valley craving anything between rice plates to pho. 

I usually get pho from here but today I was craving crispy chicken and rice. I made an order for To-Go. Staff is always friendly when I enter and helped right away. Food was good as always! 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love their pho.  One of the only ones here locally that seem to not use msg at all or very little.  MSG gives me massive headaches and I can eat without issues."}
{"text":"Love this place! Clean place, friendly staff, and great food. After coming here for a while, they even recognize me and my boothang. Prices are really on point here. Even though I'm Vietnamese, I dont really like pho but this place has the best pho. Clean clear broth, meaty taste, and portions are good for my appetite. They also offer a bigger bowl for the bigger eaters out there. I love the patio seating here and since it's by Starbucks, the place makes it perfect for people watching. Overall, I hella love this place. :)"}
{"text":"Just was not a fan. My wife and I were excited to try the place and left leaving our bowls more than half full.  Just thought flavors were off (bland), atmosphere was less than pleasant, and staff were very blah. Shocked by all the good reviews............maybe I will try it again and see if I was just delirious that day."}
{"text":"So this is just the 3rd time I've been here. But some things never change. The service is extremely slow. It was pretty busy...probably because of the rain. For me, rain=pho. 

Another thing to add, they skimp on the protein. I had maybe 3-4 pieces of rare beef and 2-3 pieces of tripe. Plenty of veggies though. The broth is flavorful. There are better places to enjoy a tasty and savory bowl of pho, but this is so close by. 

Again, service is slow, but friendly and they seem very overwhelmed when busy."}
{"text":"Eager to try any new Pho in Phoenix!  In my opinion each place has its own unique flavor blend, some... Not too good! 

PT hits the mark with a pretty decent bowl of Pho. I agree with the earlier review that called it \"Cali Pho\", it is definitely of the \"sweeter\" flavor profile, but not overly so! Coupled with a side of Cha Gio (deep fried spring roll) that were tasty as well, I will definitely be back! Our service was friendly and attentive.

The only cons I could cite was the price is a bit higher for Pho (extra meats cost more while other places already have better meat combos included in the bowl) and the Vietnamese coffee and boba drinks were way overpriced!"}
{"text":"Delicious soup broth! I only got a small taste of it to accompany my chicken noodle stir fry. I will definitely return for the pho next time. I happened to be in the Target shopping center and while my other guests wanted Five Guys, I opted for noodles. PT satisfied those cravings. Vegetarian egg roll was just fine as well. I ordered takeout and within 15 minutes my order was ready."}
{"text":"My favorite place for pho. I'm addicted!! I usually get their chicken or steak pho. I don't like going anywhere else for it."}
{"text":"Rating 2.5 stars 

I went here with coworkers for lunch. We were excited to try a new viet place in central Phoenix. Here's the breakdown of what we thought. 

Atmosphere/service:  nice clean joint. Friendly service. They have a button on the table you can push to call for service which is convenient. 

Food: we ordered pho tai, chicken with egg noodles and chicken and rice plate. The pho needs work. Overdone mushy pho noodles and broth greasy and lack flavor. The other two dishes were \"ok\" but not amazing compared to other nearby viet restaurants. We are not rushing to return but would give it another try if in the area. Oh and I also got the chicken banh mi. Definitely not the traditional kind of banh mi and flavor lacking. For the price of the items we were hoping for better taste and quality."}
{"text":"Okay...so I'd usually be bias and rate this place a easy 5 because pho is my absolute number one favorite food! But I decided to NOT get pho this time (because I knew there will be a next time) instead I ordered a Bánh Mì (Vietnamese sandwich) I have never had..yes I popped my Bánh Mì cherry...and it was good mamma like! My daughter ordered calamari and she said delicious crispy on the outside not overly seasoned and really good I also ordered the tofu spring rolls and they were good as well the only thing I wish I would have done was told them my name for next time cuz I'm going to be a regular! With that being said staff was friendly...quick...and helpful!"}
{"text":"First time visiting, they seem to be expanding all over the valley. Confusing when you enter since the room is dominated by big fast food menu boards but then they take order at the table and then make you come up to pay after the meal.

While the food was ok, this was the most expensive Vietnamese food I have ever eaten.  There are many other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the area that will charge half the price for the same dishes and better quality. Ordered fried egg rolls, Seafood Pho, and chicken and fried rice dish. The Pho and egg rolls were good but the chicken on the fried rice was over cooked and dry. Thai iced tea was good but the lemonade for my daughter was super tart, suppose just a difference in taste. 

Service was so so, the waiters seemed more interested in goofing around by the cash register than checking in their tables. 

Not horrible but probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"I am new to the area, so I just yelped it, and found this place have some really good reviews, so my expectation was high, however the experience was just the opposite, the food was okay, but the cleanness of the restaurant is not acceptable, I see the waiter checking their cell phone in between jobs, and the floor felt sticky, the table was not clean. and back to the food, I love pho so much, I can eat every other day, I haven't been to any Vietnamese restaurant that can be rated as Fair..most of them are good and excellent!!! It really disappointed to see the noodles in the hot and spicy noodle are all broken, and looked over looked, I had to use my spoon to eat the noodles, because they were little pieces, I don't know it was just a bad luck that I got a bad batch of noodles, I have never had any pho like that, to be honest..I don't think I would go back for their food again.."}
{"text":"The owners were very friendly and very open to questions. We had the Pho, some egg rolls and some Bahn mi. This was my husband's first time trying Vietnamese food. He enjoyed the sandwich and stated he would have to try more than one next time. All of the food was seasoned well. We felt like family. Drinks were reasonable. And I ended up with to go bowls because we could not finish the Pho."}
{"text":"This place is nice, clean, and super small.  The staff was ok, a little slow.  I ordered the fried egg rolls (yum) and then the pork chop plate.  1 thin pork chop for like $7 or $8.  Could have gave me a second one for that price.  The flavor was ok too."}
{"text":"My friend Shelley and I decided to try something new. We were getting pedicures and the owner of the nail salon said we should try this place. I would go back! I had the fried noodles with chicken, shrimp and beef. The broth was tasty and everything was cooked just right. We also shared the fried pork eggrolls. Usually they are a bunch of vegetables but these were mostly pork. They were yummy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we came out of there smelling like an eggroll. I think their oil needs to be changed. They have outdoor seating which is a plus."}
{"text":"Great pho! Went there on Friday during lunch, very fast and very friendly service. Not super fancy, but the food is awesome. I had 11b which is pho with meatballs, tripe, steak, brisket, cilantro, et cetera. They also bring basil, jalapenos, lime, and bean sprouts to your table. The broth is very delicious on its own. Kinda disappointed that I didn't see steamed pork buns on their menu, but it's a noodle shop, so can't complain! Very cheap for the amount you get!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service and great food. Number 46 is my fav. I also enjoy their pho! And make sure to try their thai tea!!!"}
{"text":"Really good but pricey.  The only complain I have is  when they ask if I wanted a refill on my lemonade they don't tell you there will be another  charge.  They need to disclose it because I spend another $5 on damn lemonade! But will I go again, maybe not but don't get me wrong good authentic food."}
{"text":"I freakin love this place I always come here when I get those pho cravings. The people there are always friendly, the food is always great, and them prices are easy on the pockets. I would definitely  recommend this place to anyone looking to get some pho."}
{"text":"First things first, the food and service was exceptionally great. The food I ate today was Pho. The Pho is sooo delicious that I got seconds. The waiter was really nice too. She always made sure my stay there was good( It was fantastic ).  Everything in there was well organized too!! The menu has plenty of Authentic Asian food to eat. I would recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pho to-go, and they had everything packaged to perfection!

The steak was still a little rare, but luckily the broth was scorching hot so I was able to cook all my side ingredients to emulate the perfect dine-in experience. 

The extra mile comes from their pre-packaged sauce: it was a yin-yang combo of hoisin and sriracha. I only wish I lived a little closer to support this small business more frequently!"}
{"text":"Very kind staff ... http://ptnoodles.com/locate1.html"}
{"text":"Finally found a wonderful Vietnamese restaurant. Very pleased with the overall dining service. Food was delicious, price was right, and the server was great! My husband got pho and I got my usual the chicken with vermicelli noodles. As an appetizer we got the fresh pork spring rolls. So good!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The noodles were great and the service was great too. They had like three different hot sauces and the tables and everything was clean. The two people working were very nice. The mango boba smoothie was great!"}
{"text":"Flew in Arizona today and needed to get a Starbucks at 830 am and noticed this place was open.  Ordered a couple of sandwiches and they were good. Person that took our order was very nice and reviewed the menu with us.  Would like to try more if I am in the area but do not know if I will."}
{"text":"I was so glad to see that there is great pho on the west side. This place is further from me than another option and it is superior! The server was so nice and went out of his way to make sure our infant was comfortable. He even brought her a chilled treat to chew on since she's teething. It's also incredibly inexpensive. Great value!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic international spot.  First time trying the PHO and I liked it.  The stir fry's are my favorite. My wife got #35 which comes with shrimp, beef and chicken and it was delicious.  I got the spicy noodles which already comes with the spices and its was pretty good.  Service is awesome and they are pretty quick.  I didn't realize they also sell steak which I will definitely have to try them next time.  Workers are very nice and helpful if needed. Will definitely be back.   I would give it 5 stars if the bathroom was a little cleaner."}
{"text":"New Favorite Spot! Pho Was AMAZING! Food is made upon ordering which is a bonus. Definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"PT Noodles se convirtió en uno de mis restaurantes preferidos  no nadamas la comida es sumamente deliciosa, el servicio es muy bueno y rápido, los smoothies de boba son muy ricos, mi esposo y yo estamos muy felices con este restaurantes"}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant. I come in here when I am in the area. The service is always pleasant. The food is always fresh. I absolutely love the caramel coffee."}
{"text":"The best Pho in this area, BBQ Pork sandwich is a must try! Every time I come here I would grab one to go. It's so good!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho soups I have had! The spring rolls were also to die for and the service was exceptional! Immediately serving us and very nice! Also low prices were a plus! Small sit down area but still quiet."}
{"text":"Had the chicken,beef&shrimp stir fry, it was really good. Looking forward to going back! Great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!!!...great food!!!..very good noodles and pho!!...great service and great menu!!...very flavorful!!...you should check it out and eat!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, brand new restaurant that maintains a friendly family atmosphere & classic Vietnamese dishes.
I had the rib eye plate and it was delicious although I would definitely describe it as more of a filet mignon, cut into cute little bites. It came with jasmine rice done right & veggies. My date had the Cambodian noodles (pictured below) with the broth on the side. I've had better broth but it's standard. Get the shrimp eggrolls they are crunchy and delicious & the sauce they serve it with, TO DIE FOR!!"}
{"text":"Got a pho Togo. Asked the girl at counter multiple times for an extra sauce. She said don't worry it's in there. So my gut told me to check to make sure. So I did. There was not even one in there. Let alone an extra I asked for. She had this dumb look on her face. Like seriously if you don't know just say let me double check. Don't say it's in there. I would of have been piss if I drove all the way home and found out I got nothing. The staff at this location is starting to suck."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese cusine. Fast tasty and friendly. Also, they offer miltary discount. Being my first time here, I loved it. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pho restaurant in the Western Phoenix area.  The broth is favorable and tastes as the stock is over 5 years old, it is perfect.  You can even smell the restaurant yards away from Starbucks.  The noodles are plentiful, the dishes are cheap, and they provide numerous of different sauces, veges, and other great items to throw into your bowl of noodles.  The Spring Rolls are also top notch with large size shrimp and fresh ingredients beautifully wrapped.  There is really little to complain about food wise.  The best part of the place is that it really feels like a cheap run down family owned business in a third world country that knows nothing but only making good food."}
{"text":"Best pho ever!!!! Great service, great prices, great seafood pho. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend and I will definitely be coming back. While the restaurant itself seems a little outdated and dingy it makes up for it in service and food quality. Everyone working there was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years food is fresh and the pho Broth is amazing! I also really like their mango boba smoothies! It's in a good location next to the Starbucks and they have table set up outside so you can enjoy a hot bowl outside! Highly recommend it here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is good and for non breakfast food eaters, such as myself I can have Pho for breakfast, which is my favorite! The pho and the egg rolls are my typical order. The service is ok. I give them 5 stars on food, hours, and location."}
{"text":"Great service,very attentive and helpful with menu.  Food was terrific along with leftovers for all.  Nice decor too."}
{"text":"We left the hubby on his own for dinner last night and he stumbled into PT Noodles. He liked it so much that he took us there for lunch the next day. The food is delicious and the service is great.  The three of us each got an entree and we each had leftovers enough for dinner. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The Pho is amazing. I come here a couple times a month and live it every time. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of a good quality little restaurant.  Excellent Pho soup with the best broth and meat portions of all the local Vietnamese restaurants.  Wonderful flavor and good service every time."}
{"text":"My aunt Hu Tieu Nam Vang (Cambodian Vermicelli Clear Noodle) is the best! Also I love the Com Gà (Crispy Fried Chicken With Rice) sauce! 

Satisfy your THIRST with Thai Ice Tea. :]"}
{"text":"Great place for Noddles. Its decent and small, but great service. They are pretty fast as well. This is the place to come when you are getting a cold. The only times we come here is for \"pho\" and they carry other items. I would like to try their boba smoothies."}
{"text":"The Cons:
* The staff here seems really inexperienced and the restaurant overall seems disorganized and at times a little chaotic.
* Most of the servers seem to be young adults which mean their communication skills are weak and they have no understanding of restaurant rules and etiquette.
* Many of the restaurant staff members do not speak English very well which can lead to misunderstandings during the ordering process resulting in your order being different than what you wanted or expected.
* The place lacks a certain décor and ambience.  The dining area is bright, bland, and noisy making it feel as though you are eating in a cafeteria or something.
* Tables are positioned next to one another forcing you to sit shoulder to shoulder with absolute strangers.  I prefer to eat me meals without bumping elbows with strangers or having them hear my conversations.  
* The place has sewer like stench about it.  Because this smell can also be smelled from outside, this might be more of a sewer issue than a restaurant issue.
* Service is a little slow, so if you are in hurry don't come here.

The Pros:
* A very different menu than all the other places in Surprise that seem to have the same exact menu as everybody else because all the premade food comes from the same distributor.
* Fresh and somewhat exotic food items offer a nice change of pace.
* Seems to be a healthier eating choice over your typical burgers and fries forced upon you everywhere else.
* Not necessarily cheap, but certainly less expensive than most of the other restaurants in Surprise with much better food quality.
* Food seems to be authentic prepared by authentic looking cooks.
* Management is very friendly and genuinely seems concerned about your satisfaction.
* Portions are large and very filling.

Overall:
* I have been pleased with every meal I have eaten here.  I don't know about you, but I get tired of eating wings, burgers, fries, and pizza all the time in this chain restaurant town.  This restaurant offers up a nice change of pace with meals options that are not only delicious, filling, and satisfying, but also healthier for you too.  I think once this restaurant gains more experience in restaurant management many of the cons will go away."}
{"text":"This place is my new go to place if I want some pho or bun Bo hue. The broth with the pho is almost perfect and that's the most important thing when it comes to pho. The only other pho place around Goodyear uses too much cinnamon in their broth. When ordering your pho, ask them for some nuoc beo hanh tran. It's the fatty oil that rises to the top when making the beef stock. Put a spoon full into your bowl and enjoy the green onion.

The restaurant isn't that big and there is nothing special about the decor, but as I have learned from my 30 years of eating pho, that the best places are the best.  If you want some foo foo chez whitey place then go to p.f. Changs, if you want to go where Vietnamese and other Asians eat then give pt noodles a try."}
{"text":"5 stars for taste, quality, service and affordability.  I had no idea a place like this existed in the West Valley, having had to travel to Mesa and Central Phoenix for decent Pho.  I only discovered this place one morning when I was getting coffee at the Starbucks next door and decided to check out what this \"PT Noodles\" place was.  From the outside, it looks like some cookie cutter noodle shop.  How wrong I was as soon as we stepped inside the doors...

Being from LA, and having lived/traveled to Philly, ATL, Houston, San Jose and Westminster, Pho is naturally one of my favorite foods.  I have searched long and wide throughout the Valley in search of a place that can somewhat come close (no place has been up the same level as the aforementioned places), and PT Noodles has been, in my opinion, the closest you can get to great Pho as anywhere in AZ.  As a Pho lover, the biggest and most important part that makes any bowl of Pho from average to great is the broth.  Of all the Pho joints I have tried in the Valley (15 and counting), this place had the most flavorful and rich broths of them all.  You can ask for nuac beo (fatty broth) on the side to enhance the flavor, however the broth by itself is rich and clear enough that it blows everyone else out of the water.

The cooks/serves of this place is a very small group who also know regulars (like myself) by name and are very courteous, attentive and friendly.  This is opposed to most authentic Pho places where service amounts to taking your order, and then never seeing the server again until it's time to pay the check.  They also accommodate special requests with no issues: I could not give up Pho during my summer diet, so I asked if the servers could substitute noodles with vegetables and provide extra broth without fat, to which they were able to do with no problems.

For those who like Vietnamese food outside of Pho, this place also serves a mean bowl of Bun Bo Hue and some of the tastiest broken rice dishes I've had outside of Southern California.  HIGHLY recommend for both the experienced and novice Pho lovers."}
{"text":"Close to home, but not my taste buds. Food was a little bland. Service was weird. The guy started cleaning the very dirty floor while I was eating my food, and kept apologizing. The place was niceish, but you are better off checking another spot out."}
{"text":"Great food. I tried the #56 noodles with beef. Sorry not sure on the proper spelling of the item. This was fantastic. Also had the iced coffee . Better then Starbucks. Thank you fellow Yelp users for recommending this place. Will be back. Reasonable prices friendly service good food what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"It's a cold night in the west Phoenix Valley and A hot bowl of soup sounded perfect. Quaint little spot on the south side of a Target. Yummy for my tummy"}
{"text":"Always impressed. Top notch food.friendly employees, I would go everyday if I could. I love the pho, spring rolls, lemonade, everuthing is fabulous!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab dinner when I'm on call in Goodyear. The Pho broth is always hot and delicious and the vegetables are fresh. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. It's a little hidden behind the strip mall next to the Starbucks and the space is a bit on the small side, however I've never been disappointed with the food. Anyone needing a quick and close place to grab great food should check this place out. Super convenient if you're working at Abrazo West Campus."}
{"text":"This place just opened. They're having 10% for grand opening so visit before the discount is gone. The service is pretty great! They're very attentive. Seems like they have way too many servers for the amount of traffic but no complaints here. I like being attended to. I visited on the recommendation of a friend who goes to the Surprise location. I had the combination pho. I've had better pho but it wasn't bad at all there just wasn't anything special about it. I'm going to try the Vietnamese spring rolls next time I visit."}
{"text":"This location has really amazing pho I went in on Saturday and I got 2 different types of pho and spring rolls 2 rolls and drinks and I sent $ 20"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried their rice plate, pho, bon bu hue and their drinks.  Their Thai tea and iced coffee are great! The staff is okay, nothing exceptional. My complaint is the cleanliness, the table usually smells like old rag. The place is pretty small but it's not that bad. I usually take the food to go anyway.  Anyway, give this place a try! The prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"First time here, really quite and hidden location since it is on the side of the shopping complex. The inside is small with only 35 seats for full capacity! The menus are simple and easy to navigate with the prices next to each option! The inside is quite and relaxed with little to no noise! 
When i sat down i browsed thru the menu and ordered a chicken , shrimp and beef Pho soup with 2 egg rolls and some thai tea. The eggs rolls and tea came out within 5 min of ordering and that gave me enough time to settle in and wait for the main entree. The main entree the pho was great really large portion for a good price! 
The soup was hot and steaming with many aromas coming out of it! I have to saw i was eager to taste it! The soup is not for everybody but you have to get the taste for these types of foods. Once i tasted it i was surprised the soup was really good and the meats were well cooked! 
I am happy to say i will highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and co workers since there are no other restaurants like this in the west valley! 
Really good and fresh! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now, Got the Shrimp Egg Rolls and the PHO Special Noodles Soup with Chicken and Shrimp the first time. And the Crispy Egg Rolls (Cha Glo) and PHO with Beef, Chicken and Shrimp the second time. Both times excellent and good quick service, will be back."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good food.  The service was a bit slow.  This was our second visit and they were busy both times.  We think they could eliminate some of the dust and cobwebs in the corners and windowsills."}
{"text":"The \"Bun Bo Hue\" noodle dish is soooo good!!! I like that dish more here than at the restaurant 'Pho Avina'. 

My hubby got one of the rice plates, and we think its just okay. Good, but not great. The portion size is good, though. The noodle entrees are better than the rice entrees.

The prices are reasonable. If I remember correctly, it's about ~8$ for the rice plate we got.

We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Was not expecting alot based on my first impressions.There was no one to greet and seat us upon walking in, and the menu was displayed on the wall like a fast food drive-in. I yelled \"hellloo?\" into the kitchen and someone finally came out and sat us and gave us menus. I was very glad to see vegan options for myself and ordered the veggie spring rolls and veggie pho. My husband ordered the pork banh mi, shrimp and beef spring rolls and beef pho. 

Service was lacking, the guy seemed more interested in playing apps on his phone behind the podium than takin care of us and we had to get up and walk over to him twice to ask for refills. Luckily the food made up for it! My tofu was still warm in my spring rolls so i know they made it fresh to order and the proportion of the vegetables and noodles in the roll was excellent. My husband was not so lucky, his beef and shrimp spring rolls were cold like theyd been sitting in the fridge waiting to be ordered. 

Generous servings of pho and rich deep broth, you could tell itd been simmering for hours to get the layers of flavor it had. I really didnt even need to put in any sriracha or hoisin, it stood on its own well. My husband loved his banh mi so much he got another one to take home for later. warm crusty french bread with pickled veggies and bbq pork, didnt blame him. Wish they offered a  vegetarian version of the banh mi

Waited a long time to pay and close our bill out, despite only 2 other tables being in there
 We eventually had to just get up and bring our check up front to him because we were just waiting too long for him to come collect it.

All in all they need to work on customer service and make ALL their spring rolls fresh to order, but stay the course with the rest of the food. Excellent! This is my new pho spot for sure and i will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but not the best I have had. The Pho is a bit too sweet, or just has a weird taste I've never tasted before in pho. It wouldn't ever be my go to place."}
{"text":"PT Noodles is one of the only good restaurants in Goodyear. Admittingly, I have only tried two things here; however, I could never get sick of eating them.

I usually get the 32 it's stir-fried rice noodles with tofu and mixed veggies. I have also tasted veggie pho, which was as pho-y as pho gets. My wife has had the chicken and meatball pho, both good. The meatballs are weird and expectations should be tailored away from the american idea of a meatball; having said that, they are similar at all Vietnamese restaurants.

This place is also veg friendly. There aren't many options, but the ones they have are excellent. 

We eat here often and it's always a treat!"}
{"text":"This place has to be recognized. One of the best noodles I've ever had. I got the noodle soup with the brisket. Mind you this happened in November. I received some of the best service I've ever had. I came in at 8:30pm. I had no idea that's when they closed. I ordered and sat down but realized they were closing up for the night. I got up to tell them I can get the food to go and they said no that I was able to stay. They started the grill back up and served me egg rolls for free. Served me multiple Thai teas for free. Treated me like a king when I looked like a bum cause I just got off of work. They were more then attentive. And when I got the food it tasted delicious. It was soooo good some of the best soup I've ever tasted in my life. When I was done tipped them really well. The owner came over and thanked me for eating there. One of the best times I've had. Prices were great. Really affordable for what you get. And great service."}
{"text":"This was my introduction to pho, and I ordered to-go. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING. Fortunately, I made it through with the help of a friend, and had a delicious, affordable lunch.

So there's bean sprouts, rice noodles, thinly sliced steak, but of course you've got over a dozen configurations. All ingredients were fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed stirring them into the broth, which I assume was scalding enough to do serious damage if mishandled. 

They paired well with a refreshing cabbage spring roll, made complete with thin slivers of pork sausage. I have never heard of sausage in Vietnamese food, but still, I'd definitely eat again. I loved the chili sauce it came with, and my only complaint was my broth not having enough of a kick. 

Still, though, I'd totally come back and try all the things...but I'll dine in so that I can have my meal assembled by the pros."}
{"text":"If you don't know about this place you probably would never noticed.  It is nothing special - very simple, not romantic, definitely not a place to go out for nice dinner because lack of atmosphere and ambience.  BUT :
It is ONE OF THE BEST Vietnamese places I visited.Food taste amazing,  service is great and friendly. I have been there numerous times and we get consistent amazing service and  food always taste the same.  If you like Vietnamese this is place to go.  You will go back - guarantee !"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order only to find out when I arrived that they never put it in.  The disfunction of the staff and treatment I received due to their error was none the less pitiful and signatory of a staff that doesn't care about their customers.  Save your time and try another Vietnamese restaurants that care about the customers and take pride in their service."}
{"text":"Spring Shrimp Rolls w/ Peanut sauce taste great. They are fast service & food is good. Great for lunch if you like Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Good service! The food has a very earthy flavor to it. Its Vietnamese food with a kick if you want spice or not either way its delish!!. Again another hole in the wall that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Many vegetarian options! Amazing service! Very helpful and patient. Incredible fresh herbs and perfectly cooked food with lovely flavors. Great atmosphere.  Clean.  Tables are a little cramped but was definitely worth it! I might suggest ordering a pick up dinner if you feel you need a lot of space."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch - the interior is a little grimy but they have some nice outdoor tables. The place seems pretty authentic with a loyal customer base. 

HUGE portions of pho with all the sauces and toppings you could ever need. I had the veggie pho and the tofu was excellent. The other bowls looked fresh and delicious too. Definitely a solid and satisfying option if you're looking for something fast and very casual.

The place is a little small so not great for a group"}
{"text":"If you've ever had pho anywhere else in the United States and you love it! This is the place to eat for pho insane amount of serving which makes good for leftovers or just share with a friend."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have tofu pho with veggies and it is delicious! The staff is amazing! I love them! It is always busy in here! They have outside sitting, and high chairs! This pho place is amazing! It is a must try!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much...it has so A LOT going on for itself. It's clean, fancy, modern and kind of clubby. It's got an LA vibe attracting a young vibrant crowd as well as seasoned pho'goers but I'm giving it a 3 for now because of the pho. Being Viet myself, I love everything about pho but in the landscape of phoenix Pho, PT Noodles does the same thing with their broth that in opinion does measure up to Cali pho - they make it way too sweet. I ordered pho tai only to register way too much sweet that even my noodles were sweet! Pho shouldn't ever be that sweet because it should be left to the consumer to further sweeten their broth by adding hoisin sauce. Aside from that I'm sure their other dishes are great and the presentation is on point. Phoenix pho - please stop over sweetening the broth. It kills all the subtle delicate savory flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent option for some quick, good pho or bun

Wife wanted to try the new PT Noodles place and we stopped in.  It's a small shop, but you sit quickly and orders are literally in within five minutes.  Food arrived about ten minutes after that. 

Their pho broth is very tasty and had a rich quality.  Meats are okay quality.  Service staff was very nice.  My wife liked the bun and they did a simple chicken and noodles combo for my daughter that she said was yummers.  Very limited dessert options, though.

All in all, PT noodles has a great thing going.  Glad they are around for a fast, tasty, and cheap Vietnamese option."}
{"text":"Hmmm I'm not sure I dig this place. I mean the Pho is ok if you want it to go (they don't separate the hot & sweet sauce though, which I didn't care for as I don't eat spicy, but love the sweet), but dining in was something else. We stopped in and found a clean table in the corner among all of the dirty, yet to be cleaned tables. All we wanted was Pho and when we went to order it we were told they were out. What?? You're OUT of Pho? How is that even possible. We got up and left, but right as we were about to get into our car the waitress comes running after us saying they do have Pho now and that we can come back... uhh? Ok whatever, we were seriously hungry and I was seriously hungover and needed food ASAP so we went back in. It was good I guess, typical Pho, the chicken was dry and eyuk though. The service overall was just weird, this place is under new management, but I'm not so sure they have experience in the restaurant business? They just seemed kind of lost and disorganized and the place was dirty. They didn't clean tables until people walked in, my sister carries Clorox wipes everywhere because of her babies and when she wiped our table down it was still pretty dirty even though it was \"clean\". They also had all of their dirty dishes just piled on the floor towards the back, I thought that was pretty disgusting. Oh and the large bowl of Pho was $9.75!! I thought that was a bit steep and they didn't tell us there would be a price difference when I ordered the large, say vs a regular, it doesn't say anything on the menu either so I thought that was sneaky.

Maybe they're just new or maybe that just won't matter, I don't know, but I definitely think there are better Pho places. There's one pretty close on Van Buren and Dysart that is my fav and their chicken is great! It's actually real and not this fake stuff most places use. I most likely won't go back to PT, but if you want to try them go for it, the choice is yours!"}
{"text":"Wow! Hello? I love this place! The food is absolutely delicious and without fail, CONSISTENT! Every time I eat here, the same delicious recipes, and HOT AND FRESH!! Gotta love consistency, that's what brings people back! I love the veggie egg rolls. The flavor of the taro gives the egg rolls a delicious sweet and nutty-like flavor! And so much fresh mint n romaine to wrap those golden nuggets of melt in your mouth goodness! I also had the lemon grass tofu noodle salad bowl. Soooooo delicious, again! The tofu is crisp with lemongrass all over, and fresh chopped romaine, bean sprouts, diced carrot grilled onion n noodles! The mix is probably classic Vietnamese salad, who knows, but I can't wait to have it again! And of course the service is fabulous at this location, if I could do 6 stars I would! So here's the exta"}
{"text":"I rarely write any reviews but was compelled after the extraordinarily tasty experience at PT Noodles. Having just finished a hike at a nearby park, we were hungry but unwilling to go to a chain restaurant - so we yelped local Asian places. PT Noodles popped up - Vietnamese strip mall places are typically pretty good bets so we decided to give it a go. Service was quick without being rushed, attentive without being cloying. Our fresh shrimp spring rolls were served almost immediately - they came alongside a dark, syrupy peanut sauce. All ingredients were fresh. But the main event? Beef pho - pieces of tripe, beef, meatball swimming in a rich, beefy broth that was quite simply one of the most delicious soups I've had west of the Mississippi. The meal ended with the tri-color desert , which I took to go, a coconut milk-red bean-Green jelly-shaved ice concoction that also satisfied and would be especially refreshing on a hot Arizona day. Unexpected! Tasty! Go!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place out for lunch today.  I was with my wife Sarah and 3 year old daughter Rory.

There wasn't a kids menu, so we got Rory a chicken sandwich and strawberry boba frozen drink.

Sarah got the spring rolls as an appetizer and we both got the pho with fully cooked steak.

I ate 1/2 of Rory's sandwich & tried the drink.  LOVED the fresh bread. Not sure if they made the bread onsite, but it was epic.  I'm not kidding.

I was so happy with the bread, I didn't get to try the spring rolls.  Sarah gave them 2 thumbs up.  

Sarah and I both loved the pho, although they were skimpy on the meat.  I recommend putting the jalepenos in the bowl, but not actually eating them.  They were uber hot for my tastes.  I also regret going overboard with the basil.  Too much of anything isn't a good thing.

Extremely filling and the flavors were outrageous!   

I thought it odd that they don't bring your check to the table.  You go up to the table and they check you out there.  Service isn't great.  Also the decor isn't anything to write home about, but the food was awesome."}
{"text":"The fresh limeade is excellent.  Love the summer rolls and Bun, served with just the right amount of noodles (most places give you way too much). The flavor of the meat is delicious. 

I'm not a fan of fish sauce for dipping, and their peanut sauce is short on peanut butter/pean. It basically looks like a bowl of soy/hoisin with some crushed peanuts on top. Not a fan.

Still, a solid 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Went here last night, and I wasn't disappointed! The service was great, with the host (a recent migrant to the US) being especially courteous and professional. The pho was great, though a bit lacking on tendon. The best food of the night probably went to the bahn mi and the shrimp egg rolls - both were truly the stars of the meal. We also had the salad bowls, calamari, and taro boba. The boba was good, the salad bowls had HUGE servings, and the calamari was alright, though it didn't really taste like squid and was a bit on the burnt side. I wouldn't want to end on a bad note, so I'll just say this - go here! It's well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I'm so extremely off on trying new Vietnamese restaurants because I've had so many un-satisfying experiences. I'm so used to eating home-cooked authentic Vietnamese food as well as living in Little Saigon, California where the most authentic restaurants are located. Not a lot of places meet the standard. 
My siblings took me here for lunch on a regular weekday Tuesday and the place was completely dead, we were the only ones in there, I was completely thrown off, thinking why were they so slow? I was already there, so I wasn't going to complain. I ordered their fried chicken with fried rice (ga chien voi com chien) and I am SOOOOO glad I gave this place a try. It's one of the best, and you've definitely heard it from me. The owners were extremely nice and their service was amazing.  I also must say I don't remember the pricing but I do remember that it was a pretty darn good deal. 
On another day where my family got off so late and we didn't feel like cooking, my brother got us all pho and spring rolls to go, so yes, they have takeout. I had the pho. I had the spring rolls. It was so good, I do dare say it's better than most of the pho shops in Cali. You've got a new regular PT Noodles! Y'all exceed the standard."}
{"text":"The bast Vietnamese food in Goodyear every time come to Phoenix I  have to come here to enjoy this delicious food,  the beef and rice taste delicious and the noodles so wonderful"}
{"text":"Today was my day to become schooled in Vietnamese cuisine! 

Location & Aesthetics - located in Goodyear off Litchfield Road.  The business is difficult to see and/or notice from Litchfield Road and there weren't any signs that I could see. (-1)
As you enter the shopping center/area, there's Target and Michael's in front of you.  I proceeded straight and took a right toward the Starbucks and only upon doing so we saw a sign with an arrow that the business was ahead.  
Once you turned right toward Starbucks, you will make a left turn as if going to Starbucks, then you will see the restaurant.
Parking can be difficult to secure as the parking is shared with many of the surrounding businesses to the left and right, e.g. Starbucks and a tanning salon.
The restaurant was clean, and well lit from the indoor lighting and from outside as well.
Noise was minimal.  There's a TV in the corner but was muted with subtitles on.
The restaurant is on the small size so if you're bringing a large party or gathering, I'm guessing the staff will have to join some of the tables together.
As you enter, the checkout is directly in front a few feet away
We were promptly greeted and asked if we were dining in, how many, and directed to sit.  Menus were brought to us immediately.

Menus - the menu was extensive and many (if not all) of the dishes were in their Vietnamese names though with english explanations beneath.

Service - a waitress appeared, greeted us, was very friendly, and took our drink and food orders.  It's not a big deal but I felt that she could've asked if we had been there before or if we have ever tried their dishes, etc.  Or perhaps she could've offered some suggestions to try even though we didn't ask for any.
My only gripe - offer eating utensils that is individually wrapped in napkins versus being given to you by the person who brings out your dish to the table and rests your eating utensils on the table. (-1)
Food - I had the Cm tm (#40 on the menu) which consisted of rice with fractured rice grains, with grilled pork plus the Vietnamese dish bì (thinly shredded pork mixed with cooked and thinly shredded pork skin) over broken rice.  The rice was steamed well and wasn't dry but very moist and sticky as it should be.  The pork was cooked well and wasn't chewy but very flavorful and well seasoned.  The thinly shredded pork wasn't for me as it's apparently served cold and had a somewhat of a burnt smokey taste to it which I didn't quite like.
The rice and meat are served with various greens and pickled vegetables, along with a prawn paste cake.  The vegetables and greens was fresh, crunchy, and well cooked though I didn't get much of the pickled taste I was supposed to pick up from them.  The prawn paste cake was interesting in terms of taste and texture but was palatable, edible, and I enjoyed it.
I've been told that the dish can also be prepared with trng hp (steamed egg), and grilled prawns however I didn't see any of these on my plate.  
The dish also came with a small bowl of, what I believe is called, nc chm which I'm told is to cleanse the throat or can be used for dipping as well.  Well, it did exactly what it was supposed to do - cleanse the throat.  It was much too strong for me and unfortunately I had to leave it back.  I'm guessing it must've been from the vinegar in it.
The dish also had a fried egg as well which you can request to have cooked well done as I did.  I'm told that instead of the fried egg (though I can be incorrect) the dish is served with a ch trng egg meatloaf.
For drinks, I had a strawberry smoothie (don't know the word for it in Vietnamese).  It was freshly made and was very tasty.

I think this place is worth coming back to particularly in winter and fall when the temperature starts turning cold so that I can try their Pho so to be continued...."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall..my wife and I have been looking for a noodle please ever since moving here from Hawaii. We stumbled upon PT Noodles and gave it a shot. It's a different kind of place from what we were looking for, but we were pleasantly surprised. Great service and the broth was amazing. Prices are so so, but you get a lot of food. The place is a bit on the dingy side, but it is in a strip mall after all. With that being said, we have been back almost weekly for the past few months and have taken several people with us and they all have loved it."}
{"text":"More vegan options on the west side! Ate today for the first time at PT Noodles and as luck would have it, got a fantastic vegetarian waiter who was able to make some tasty vegan recommendations! The \"chicken\" wings in lemongrass sauce was made with tofu and it was AMAZING!!! I normally hate tofu, but I was ecstatic with this dish. It is not on the menu, but Travis, the veg waiter suggested it and I will definitely be returning. I also had the veggie pho and it was good, but the lemongrass tofu was hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Been here several times, everything we've tried is great. Great portions & cheap prices. Win. Win."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Pho ever! We love this place, it's family owned. They make the broth fresh every morning, by evening it is SO fantastic! I can't say enough good things. We've tried other things on the menu, all great too but don't miss their Pho"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are fast. They are friendly. The food and drinks are amazing. Their menu is huge! There is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Delicious vermicelli! I love to get their chicken vermicelli with egg roll and it's so tasty and refreshing. I also love their banh mi sandwiches which are less than $5, and their taro boba! I give them four stars only because their pork is consistently fatty. I've gotten it in their sandwiches, as an entree with rice, in pho, and with vermicelli, and I absolutely love pork but have had to switch over to their chicken because I end up removing half of it every time because of all the fat. I'm still happy with their chicken and I still go their regularly for their delicious food but you should definitely skip the pork."}
{"text":"I am glad we have this Pho establishment in the West Valley. The Pho has always been pretty good and plentiful and the staff is always friendly and attentive. The eggrolls are always on point! I have to try out a Banh Mi sandwich sometime. Everytime I come here I always see Vietnamese people eating here as well so that must be a good sign right?"}
{"text":"I came here a few times with my mom because this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant that's decent to where we live. It's way better than pho house & king eggroll.

My mom ordered a com tam dish and she said it was pretty good. I ordered banh xeo and egg rolls. I like how the texture of the banh xeo was so crunchy but I didn't like how there wasn't much meat inside. It was almost straight bean spouts. Other than that The egg rolls was pretty good. I also ordered a coconut drink which was also delicious!

The customer service was quick and we also got our food out within ten mins after ordering so I definitely liked that.."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested I try the wok fried ribeye steak. It comes with fried egg (runny yolk) and rice and slices of wok fried onions. First bite and I couldn't believe I waited so long to try it. It's so delicious!! You get what you pay for with this one! I'm for sure going to come back to have some more!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid Vietnamese restaurant! The portions were generous! I had the pho dac biet and my husband had bun thit nuong ch a gio and everything was amazing! The service was great and they use a call button in case you need anything. The place was clean and spacious. I recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese food in the far west Valley?  You better believe it!

Sure, I'm just a simple, yet sexy, white dude reviewing Vietnamese dishes... but I have struggled through enough awkward conversations with the families of numerous Asian girlfriends throughout the years over wonderfully authentic and delicious Asian meals to know great cuisine that is done right.

And PT Noodles does it right!  Excellent across the board (or menu, I suppose)!  

Special shout outs to their pho, banh mi, and Vietnamese coffee... but I have loved many of their dishes!

The restaurant itself is typical of many Vietnamese restaurants  -- clean, but nothing fancy.  The service at PT Noodles has always been very attentive during all of my visits.   

Overall, one of my favorite Valley Vietnamese restaurants!

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"Tried pt noodles for the first time today. Got the veggie pho and veggie rolls. Glad their are vegetarian options. It was delicious and deffinetly will be going more often since its close by the target we go to and it so yummy."}
{"text":"Pho The Noodles?? 

Not really sure what PT Noodles is supposed to stand for, but they have a legit quick stop Vietnamese spot if your in the Goodyear area. I always gravitate to pho when I don't feel well, and this spot was the closest on the day. It isn't a very big spot, and doesn't have fancy decor or televisions everywhere... and if anything I'm glad they don't.

No frills food served quickly and authentically. I have a tried another shop closer to Lee Lee supermarket and thought it was weird when I was served egg rolls without mint or lettuce. Not the case here. Crisp outer shell with fresh mint and lettuce. The only way it should ever be served. I also had their fresh lemonade which was sweet and tart at the same time. I took the left over mint from the rolls and added it in since they didn't. The pho had a clean broth, and a balanced amount of noodles to meat.  I also grabbed some banh mi for tomorrow's lunch and will report back on those in a later update.

Overall I'm happy to have found this spot and will stop by whenever I'm in the area and in need of good pho."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Pho. One of the few places we have seen with Vegetarian broth.  Both our meals were excellent. Service was outstanding. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Their Pho (I ordered the #7) wasn't very good and that's 25% of their menu.  The broth was just too simple and bland.  The noodles were a bit undercooked.  Al dente is great with pasta but when it comes to Pho, I prefer my noodles to be softer.  Hu Tieu house special (#5) was decent.  Instead of the clear noodles, they used the same pho noodles.  Regardless, the Hu Tieu broth was pretty tasty.  If only the Pho broth was at the same level as the Hu Tieu's.  I also tried the Nem Nuong Cuon (#1).  It was okay.  Very basic.  A couple of thin slices of nem nuong (grilled ground pork) rolled with some lettuce and fried egg roll wrappers. The hoisin dipping sauce was a bit too salty.  I prefer the Nha Trang style sauce with Nem Nuong Cuon or even a hoisin peanut sauce.  The house dipping sauce didn't cut it for me.  

The place is pretty clean and they use disposable chopsticks...a big plus!  The staff is pretty friendly and helpful.  

I would return in the future to try their Com Tam only if I'm in the area.  I would not go out of my way to dine here.  I would definitely skip the Pho for sure.  

Overall, this place is A-OK.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"So so good! I just went in for the first time today. I've been really sick and not craving food at all until today, when a craving for Pho kicked in. My favorite Pho place is all the way in Mesa so when I saw this place was 5 mins from my house I decided to try it out. So glad I did!

The place is small but clean. The staff was very nice and friendly. Took about 15 mins for us to get our to-go order, which in my opinion isn't bad at all. 

I got the pho with well done flank and my dad ordered the hot and spicy noodle soup. The flavors were spot on! My dad is a very typical Mexican man who likes his meals home cooked and very Mexican dishes and he LOVED the hot and spicy noodle soup. I'm picky about my pho because I'm a purist, I don't like to add too many things to it, I like to taste the actual broth. If the broth is good then you don't need to add all these sauces. Case in point, I didn't need to add anything to my pho other than the bean sprouts and stuff it already came with. The broth was very well balanced and it definitely hit the spot.

I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had been to this place about a year ago, and the food was great. Today, was a different story. The pho was okay, nothing special. When I received my spring rolls, it appeared that they had been in the refrigerator pre made for a couple of days. The reason I say this is because part of the rice paper wrap was hard as plastic and the meat tasted pretty old and gamy. When I brought this to the waiters attention, the way he responded was like questioning why I had eaten one already and just now complaining. Do you want to know the real reason why I ate the whole one mr. Waiter? I guess the peanut sauce was very distracting and I had ignored the fact of the hidden flavors behind it. Plus, the bean sprouts were brown and they tasted fermented. They blamed the fact on serving rotten bean sprouts on the store that they buy them from?! I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was craving some really good pho and I heard this place was good.  Wow, the other reviewers were right.  I had a spicy noodle bowl and it was fantastic - and possibly the best pho that I've had in Phoenix.  My hubby had a bbq pork sandwich.  He said it was a little too \"bready\" but it was good.  We also shared some spring rolls.  I had a thai iced tea and he had a Vietnamese coffee.  Our total bill?  $20!  I should also mention that it is really easy to eat gluten free here.  All of the soups have rice noodles, and the only thing that I had to avoid was the spicy peanut sauce with the spring rolls.  Everything was outstanding."}
{"text":"Finally PT noodles close to me.. one of the best vietnamese restaurant ...no joke...no more driving far for us to west side locations ...best food and great atmosphere.. we love the decors on the wall..super nice n clean . Service was excellent!!!! Thank you...will b back for sure..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the decor. Everything is decorated modernly and the tables even have a button to press to call service which is pretty neat. Menus are even nice! 

Very friendly service and delicious food! Got the Pho Tai and it was pretty good.

Definitely worth a try & since they're new, 10% off!"}
{"text":"Having backpacked a few weeks in Vietnam and eaten the local street food north to south, I can honestly say this is the next best thing to being back there. Food is authentic, tasty, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. The first time the service was fairly quick and the food was great. I came two weeks later and ordered two bowls of Pho and it took over 35 minutes to get out food out when people who got here before us got their food which is really annoying. Horrible service, great food."}
{"text":"Would get 4 stars but they are always in such a rush to get orders out that they have gotten my orders wrong TWICE and my husband, uncle and daughter got stuck with a disgusting tripe pho which no one liked and no one ate! What a waste of money! And when I told them they got the orders wrong they just shrugged like they didn't understand or speak English. When the food is right it is great, but consistency is not key... some times I order vegetarian pho and it comes with lots of veggies and fried tofu and other times they run out of veggies and give me very little and the tofu is not fried... some times I get lots of broth and some times I get very little. It's so inconsistent it's annoying."}
{"text":"Love the Pho! This last time we also got Fried Noodles. It was recommended by another friend through work. Amazingly delicious. The sauce at the bottom of that dish is heaven. Each dish is enough for two to share. Can't wait to go back."}
