{"text":"Excellent breakfast! We took a drive from Toronto to Kleinberg and stopped here on the way. You can easily miss this place as it's hidden behind a miFuel gas station, but so worth finding. They pass the coffee test - huge mugs, decent coffee, tasty non fatty sausages and addictive hash browns. 10 out of 10"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall diner with amazing food and free coffee! Can't go wrong with a great family owned business. Would definitely recommend the Eggs Benedict. Been many times and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Coffee here was good. Service was friendly. Interior is cozy and comfortable.  The food, however, was pretty sub-par.  -The french toast was pedestrian and bland - The bacon was microwaved (!!) and had an off taste - The avocado eggs benedict was advertised as having a basil infused hollandaise and as having sautéed tomatoes. The hollandaise had a few shakes of dried basil in it and the tomato was not sautéed in fact it was raw and cold straight from the fridge. Which doesnt taste bad at all but the point of having a hot ingredient in an eggs benny is to keep it warm, esp since the avocado slices are also cold (as they should be) so the whole thing was just cold and unpleasant. Had they sautéed the tomatoes as advertised it would have been so much better  On top of that, my wife and i feel a bit ill now 2 hours after eating and are worried the food was off.  Disappointing for sure, this place has a lot of potential. I won't be going back but hope they turn it around and others get better experiences here, they are still pretty new."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Food was even better!  Classic breakfast served quickly and with a smile. Definitely a new weekend breakfast destination for us. Highly recommend anyone to come and try this newly renovated spot."}
{"text":"So - this place was on the radar when I was hunting for a good breakfast this weekend. Landed here on Sunday morning in hopes of a great breakfast at a reasonable price with free coffee as advertised.   There were 2 reviews. 1 positive and one so so.   I sat down at 10:50-am. There were a bunch of tables who were happily munching away. As soon as I sat down, I knew I'd be waiting a while.   7 mins until I was offered a coffee. 35 minutes from the time I ordered until the food I ordered was in front of me. I'm talking 2 eggs. 2 sausages, two slices of toast cut in half and home fries.   I'm really confused. Any breakfast place I've ever been to had the food ready in less than 10 mins.   The problem is as follows...  I had a chat with the front end staff. It consisted of one girl. Furiously running back and forth from the tables to the kitchen.   Unfortunately that was it. There was no backup. Rather, there were about 5 young guys in the back (kitchen), taking their sweet ass time doing whatever they wanted.   Honestly I was in shock when it took me over 40 mins to get a coffee and a breakfast. This is a new, renovated place (in a gas station), and you'd figure everyone would be chipping in to pull their weight.   The lovely girl was holding her own but the guys in the back were absolutely slacking.   Their operation is a mess and I'd recommend for the owner to fire them re-hire basically skilled chefs to cover the orders.   While I understand this is a family business, the last think you want to do is support inefficient workers.   Honestly this place has potential.   Eggs were cooked well. Sausage was fresh. Home fries were awesome.   My only beef. 35 mins for a simple breakfast.   All the best to ya."}
{"text":"I used to visit this breakfast place when it was known as Oreos a few years ago. The new owners seem to have renovated the interior, which looks significantly better than the old truck stop vibe from years past. Unfortunately, the service was absolutely calamitous. I went there for a friend for breakfast on Sunday/Mother's Day and two basic breakfast plates took about an hour to be served. There were loads of people waiting for their food and even more people waiting to be seated, despite the fact that there were open seats available. The two waitresses on duty seemed completely overworked and the kitchen was obviously understaffed. We came here because our regular breakfast place - Sunset Grill - was packed and overflowing with Sunday guests, but in retrospect we would've probably gotten our food much faster if we went there.   To the owner: Please make sure you staff your business to meet the amount of people who come to eat. Otherwise you are losing a lot of business by way of angry customers who will never return because your staffing shortages ruined their breakfast experience.   I won't be returning in the near future, especially as there are other options who serve the food in a fraction of the time."}
