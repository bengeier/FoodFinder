{"text":"They were out of several things we ordered. The food took forever to get there. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better experience, wrong orders multiple times, staff doesn't believe in remembering the side dishes that are come with meals. Having onion allergies and saying no onions but still having onions in my order... Just sad can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. The noodles had an awesome flavor. I had chicken that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My husband ordered pork fried rice and it was delicious. I would recommend this place and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Weak Pho and way over priced. Staff was kind, but the price to taste ratio was out of wack. Maybe if they were at a different location they could lower prices."}
{"text":"After reading all of the 5 stars reviews for this restaurant, I decided to try it out and I was very disappointed. Pho Da Biet is meh, Goi Cuon Thit Tom is meh, Goi Cuon Nem Nuong is meh and Bun Bo Hue is should be avoided. The broth in the Pho is decent and not authentic (more Americanized). Bun Bo Hue is not spicy even though the menu stated it is. Both of the Goi Cuon is decent but not worth the price. I have had better for a cheaper price within 3 miles of this restaurants. One good thing out of this Vietnamese restaurant is they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers,
This place is very shockingly beautiful the insides are so nice to look at, and it seems like a good romantic date night spot for couples. It's very american looking and steers away from traditional looking pho shops. Which is good more modernize looking, appealing. The food is alright the pho is good but to be honest its not as great as other shops I been to, but it's still really good to me the broth is a little more watery than most I tasted. I ordered chicken pho and it was delicious but like I put not my favorite of all that I tasted. But still really delicious. I finished all of it and loved it."}
{"text":"Expected better,food was mediocre at best....but what was disappointing was customer service. I walk in and I'm the only customer they have, told the young waitress found your spot through yelp, showed her some dishes I'd like to try, she didn't know the menu,had to ask others,went to bathroom to wash hands and bathroom was dirty, plus no paper towels , no one knew where to get paper towels(all employees must wash hands). When food was brought to table,visually beautiful, but not much flavor. My waitress came back to table once to check on me, because she took her lunch break, she was nice the one time she did come to my table. Had high expectation for this place, so disappointing."}
{"text":"NOPE! We won't be back! 
The place had 3 tables occupied when we arrived and it took 35 min to get our eggrolls. The PHO followed 15 mins later and they got my husband's order wrong. 
Very dissapointing but luckily we have plenty of other PHO places to visit"}
{"text":"This is a pretty new pho restaurant in the Arrowhead area so I decided to take my friend. The restaurant's decor was modern with an Asian twist, the music was very hip, and the service was good. However, the pho broth was just \"ok\". It tasted clean and like any ordinary broth, but lacked the richness you get from simmering the bone broth for hours."}
{"text":"Great place, spacious and clean. Outside area is really nice at night. Pho broth is one of the best tasting broth in Arizona. Fast and attentive service. Minimal wait time for food to come. Would definitely take my friends here. One suggestion: have filet mignon pho, would go nicely with the broth."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly, food is delicious but they are a bit stingy on the meat imo. I only found like 10 thin slices of rare beef in my noodle. I usually order large bowl of rare pho and for 11 bucks I expected a little more meat than that. They let me have extra pho for free which was nice, but sometimes they do charge me for it. I guess it depends on the server."}
{"text":"The PHO was pretty good, nice and spicy.  The Tai ice tea was on point as well.  They are pretty pricey though compared to some of the equally good competition located in more low rent districts.

The reason for just 3 stars is because they gave me a very smelly cloth napkin.  There was no concession offered after kindly bringing this to the waiters attention.
Also, the waiter almost lost my CC when cashing us out as well.  It was concerning and comical watching him move nearby patrons around as he tried to find it.

I'll go back,  but I'm going to give them a little more time to get their act together."}
{"text":"Great Pho and egg rolls. My husbands first time and he loved it. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Minus 1. Take out was just bad. The Pho was awful. The only decent thing was the shrimp spring roll. Had a variety of dishes,and was totally disappointed in all of them. Will never be back."}
{"text":"We ordered crab Rangoon which was delicious for an appetizer.  We then had Pho with beef and veggies and a stir fry dish with chicken and veggies. Both were excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us came to eat here for lunch on a Sunday. They were out of several tea drinks, limes, even table settings. It took exceedingly long to get our food. No of the food was bad but not impressive by any means."}
{"text":"I'm removing one star from Pho for Days not because of their service, it continues to be excellent. My favorite appetizer they offer is Salt and Pepper Shrimp. The first two times I ordered it, the head-on whole shrimp were plump, dipped in a light tempura, fried to a perfect crispness, and lightly dusted with salt and pepper. Last night my order was much different, the shrimp were stringy, not dipped in the light batter, and kind of greasy. Our neighborhood needs this wonderful little Vietnamese restaurant. I hope they address this relapse in their cooking technique. 
UPDATE: 9-21
I visited Pho For Days today at lunch and ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp, excellent! The shrimp were fresh, fried to a perfect crispness, and tasty. I am replacing the 4th star. This really is a good restaurant with great service and delicious food. I also ordered the beef salad. So good. In past visits we have ordered the Vietnamese Crepe and the Shredded White Meat Chicken Salad. Both were fresh and delicious. All of the dishes are Keto."}
{"text":"So happy that a Vietnamese restaurant opened up around this area (we don't have very many around here). This location used to be a different restaurant called \"Humble Pie\" but \"Pho For Days\" took over. At first I was kind of sad because I also enjoyed dining at Humble Pie but boy oh boy is this place yummy! This Vietnamese restaurant is definitely more modernized, and have a nice environment and ambiance. Due to this reason, prices here are a little high than the usual norm at  a viet restaurant. If you're like me and don't mind paying more for good quality food, then you'd love this place! They also have an open kitchen which is a big plus so you can see what really goes on behind the making of your food and from our experience today, everything was made fresh. 

Here's  what we ordered:

Goi Cuon (Fresh Spring Rolls): $5

Bo Luc Lac (Shaken Beef with Rice: $16

Com Bo Nuong (White Rice plate with ribeye): $14

The spring rolls came with 2 rolls so my friend and I each had our own. What made this item really special is that their dipping sauce was perfection. They used the correct ratios for every ingredient and the sauce blended very well altogether. I was definitely impressed. 

The Shaken Beef came with a side of rice, sautéed chili, and some assorted veggies such as onions, bell peppers, mushroom and shredded lettuce. The beef was marinated well and the lettuce has a nice light dressing with it. My plate did kinda have a lot of oil in it probably from both the beef and the lettuce dressing but this didn't bother me!


My friend said the ribeye dish was also tasty. We are super thrilled to come back here and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"It still looks like humble pie. They have the same alcohol that was in the bar. Small portion, slow service. 

The bread on the Bahn Mi sandwich was so hard it was almost inedible. 

Overall for the price this place doesn't have the quality it should."}
{"text":"Quick, great service, reasonable prices! Make sure you get the D1 pho with the tripe and tendon like it's supposed to be made...trust me, it will change your life. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I decided to try this place since we've had pho across the valley and we weren't impressed. The pho was average. I ordered a larger vs the regular size my coworker got and paid the extra $2 yet both were the same size and same amount of ingredients. I had ordered just the meatball pho but they added raw beef to my order as well. The basil was not fresh, was wilting and seemed old. The jalapeños were very small. The food was good but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"We have passed by this location many times but was skeptical about stopping in.  I was worried it would be very Americanized and overpriced due to the location of the restaurant.  My wife had the Pho Dac Biet and it was good, nice size portion for $11 a bowl.  The spring rolls and eggrolls were overpriced, nothing special but they taste good. I had the Banh Mi Thit Noung, really tasty sandwich with good fillings and they even had pate on it which is very big for me. Overall there are other places nearby that are not as pricey but we would try them again, if you're in the area I would say stop in and try them out.

Our server was fast, nice, and had a wonderful personality!  Seating outside was perfect for our lunch date."}
{"text":"Usually pho place is pretty fast with decent price. This time however we have quite a long wait, long wait for food, longer than average wait for Check.

We ordered the pho with tripes, tendon, and meat balls with beef slices.
The veggies like sprout doesn't seem as fresh as it should be, and the broth tasted abit blend. The pho noodles was pretty good. But the broth is one of the most important ingredients and is lacking.

We also ordered some garlic butter wings. The flavor is not there. And some of the bigger wings the inside is still abit bloody....

My husband ordered the mun noodles with grilled pork. It was okay, we have had much better pork with more grilled flavor in other pho places.
The spring roll that come with the noodles tasted pretty good though.

We paid about $35 dollars + tips and we both only had water. I think it's abit pricey for pho and the quality of food"}
{"text":"Exquisite pho,delicate and flavorful. Great atmosphere and stellar service. I had the veggie and tofu and it was ah amazing."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!. I have tried 3 different Pho restaurants in the valley. This rates best. I had the sliced beef pho. The broth had great flavor, veggies and herbs were fresh. Others had the chicken pho and beef and brisket pho and spring rolls. All delicious.  We will definitely be back soon. My only recommendation to the owners/waitstaff is to give instructions on the proper way to wrap your spring rolls and about adding the sides of veggies /herbs and sauces. My friends ate here previously and did not know this. It was not my first time so I knew the routine but at the very first pho restaurant I ate at they did go thru a quick explanation and it was very helpful. Also The spring rolls are most delicious when eaten wrapped in lettuce with veggies and herbs. 

Try the limeade which was yummy."}
{"text":"The Phó is excellent and the egg rolls are AMAZING!!  The atmosphere is very inviting and the staff are friendly and courteous!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today and it's one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. I got the Pho Tái and fresh mango smoothie and they were both delicious! Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever had. I called and asked if they do to go orders and they said yes. They gave me so much food I thought I had received the wrong order. Plus it was under $10!!!! Very good taste, not salty like most places Ive been too. They also give a good amount of noodles and meat. Definitely will be back in the near future. I recommend this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phoenix! We've been looking for a long time for a good Pho place and finally found it!!"}
{"text":"1) Service was great, he kept us updating about our food and made sure everything was okay.
- We ordered 1 order of eggrolls and it was tasteless. 

2) Ordered four bowls of Bun Bo Hue, we had to wait 30 minutes for FOUR bowls of BBH. Okay, that's fine.. they must be short staffed or they're trying taking their time on our bowls.
3) Our lettuce came out and I was dissapointed that those are not the lettuce you usually get for BBH. The lemons were dry. 
4) Finally our 4 bowls of noodles came out. There was only one bite of noodles. We asked for extra noodles and he came back with a small amount of it and said \"Sorry that's all the noodles we have\". How are you out of NOODLES at 1PM on a Sunday??? They mixed rice noodles with the noodles that comes with BBH. 
5) what my friends and I ordered was not even BBH. It was definitely Pho's broth. They just added Sate in it to have the color. No meat that usually comes with BBH. No pork blood and a lot of other items that were SUPPOSE to come with it. 
6) I cannot believe none of us did not send our noodles back. I regret doing so. More over, I am upset that we paid for it alWill never come back again!"}
{"text":"It is my second time coming here. Thought I would give it another chance. I was once again disappointed with their customer service. We waited over 30mins when I finally told the server we would be going else where. All he said I am sorry they just started on the food. Not once did they come and let us know that they were working on our order. I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The servers were nice and refilled our drinks without asking! The broth for the pho was really good, no trace of msg! I ordered their original pho and happy to say that the place is clean !"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Pho and this place did not disappoint I got the D2 rare beef pho and it was delicious. My sister got the shrimp Pho and that was pretty yummy as well. We also ordered the spring rolls and crab Rangoons along with a Pineapple Boba 

Our server was awesome and very attentive. I'll be coming back soon"}
{"text":"The pho isn't bad, but it's also not my favorite.  A little trendy and more expensive than other places.  If you're in the neighborhood and it's raining, it's a good fix for soupy needs."}
{"text":"Had just left this restaurant. Came in and got sat down for 20 mins with no water given to us. No one had acknowledged us. Never come back . Poor.... below poor customer service....."}
{"text":"Went 2 nights in a row. Bomb Pho. One of the best pho broths that I have had. It was full of flavor and was a clear broth. They do not skimp on the meat or the noodles. Comes with thai basil, mung bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime. Reminds me of the pho I used to get in Southern California. Clean restraunt. Good service. Food came out within a reasonable time. I will definately be returning"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their pho. I believe they have a much better tasting broth than many other pho restaurants in the area.

The restaurant is a little hidden. Not really on a main street, but their business isn't facing an obvious view on the street.

Nice and spacious inside, very modern and up-to-date decor

Their bowls are one sized only, which is a let down (what if I'm really hungry?) Their meat-to-noodles ration is lacking a little, but not a huge difference considering other lacking restaurants I've been too. They do have very high quality meats, so I suppose that makes up for the less meat ratio.

The staff is very friendly and helpful when needed.

I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"The pho here absolutely lacks flavor. Don't know what other's standards are to say this is the best in arrowhead but their broth tastes like it had maybe one animal bone to cook for one hour it tastes like nothing. The higher prices because this is at arrowhead, about 2 times as much on average expect to pay around $13 for a bowl of pho.

The best part of my meal was the spring roll, the pho dac biet was very lacking in all aspects besides size. Will not be coming again because why would I when I can go to a nearby spot for half the cost along with quality?"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! From the spring rolls, calamari (awesome) to the bbq pork sandwich - all tasted great.  Great service, too! Definitely coming back and recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Came here with our kids - really nice inside and food was yummy! Vietnamese iced coffees, spring rolls, pho with rare beef and beef balls, and crispy stir fried noodles were all delicious. We go to a lot of pho and the broth here is one of the best we've had. Staff was really nice and accommodating too."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain might recommend this restaurant....read and find out why.....

Pho for Days recently opened in P83 and is right next to the Peoria Sports Complex. They have a nicely furnished casual dining room and a patio. They offer a wine list and do offer bottles of wine that cost up to $100.00. 

I ordered the Broken Rice Plate with Lemongrass Chicken. My white meat chicken was very tender and very flavorful. Along with the chicken were fried bell peppers, onions, scallions and some spicy hot peppers. My plate also came with some vegetable garnish, Fresh hot rice, chicken/pork soup and this smokey chili oil sauce. I thought it was good but differed in flavors  from other Restaurants that offer this same dish. Good just different.

My husband ordered his usual Hot and Spicy. It doesn't say on the menu that this dish contains CONGEALED PORK BLOOD CUBES. The bowl had mostly a very large almost meatless pork knuckle and several blood cubes in it. When my husband got the dish he got sort of grossed out. Our waiter was very understanding and offered to get him something else so he got a Pho with rare beef and brisket. He said it was very light with the meat.

The food might differ slightly from the other Vietnamese Restaurants out there. 

It might be a good thing after all Anthony Bourdain LOVES congealed pork blood!

The waiter and the whole staff were very nice to us.

Give them a try and see what you think!"}
{"text":"First time there and I already know I'm coming back. I went with my friends for a casual dinner and we had a great experience! The food was excellent and my friend who's never had Vietnamese food even thought it was \"the tits.\" Not only was there great food, but also great service. Sam was rad! Keep it up, Pho For Days! We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome! Very friendly, and attentive staff:) My drink was delicious, so I totally recommend the $6 Long Island! I was adventurous and tried their hot and sour beef soup, and it was AMAZING!!! My hubby is more traditional and had the regular beef pho. We really enjoyed the freshness and great taste!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday was kinda busy..had the shakey beef also the salt & pepper shrimp was so yummy! Sam was our server and she was an amazing soul! Will come back definitely."}
{"text":"This place is delicious stop looking for somewhere to eat and come here. I got the D6 beef brisket pho it's very filling and yummy. Highly recommend you try it. The place was generally quiet great background music and the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"The PHO is amazing!!! The best I've had in the West valley absolutely my new fav we will become regulars trust me..... My husband also got the BBQ beef sandwich that he finished in 5 mins because he said it was sooooo BOMB!"}
{"text":"A little bummed. Came here after \"happy hour\" and it was super expesive@!! Average Pho, expensive egg rolls.....just not pleased. im used to Bomb ass Pho from SD! gatta find a better place in Phoenix/west valley. If anyone has any recommendations please let me know...thanks!"}
{"text":"This is our second trip to Phoenix and our second trip to Pho for Days. The food is delicious, the place has a great ambience and our Servers have been friendly and wonderful. We even brought my parents who had never tried pho before and they loved it! Such a pleasant place for a family meal or date night. We really enjoyed our dining experience and will return whenever we are in town! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool new Vietnamese spot that just opened right here in the P83 entertainment district. 

They are located where the old Humble Pie used to be. 

I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, so I was very skeptical coming here for the first time. However once I walked into the place the atmosphere was really cool, fun, and inviting. 

There were several groups having a great time from the looks of it! Haha 

There's a open view to the chefs and they were seriously going to town cooking up masterpieces left and right. They looked as if they were having the time of their lives back there cooking. I loved it! So awesome! 

The menu has a lot of options to choose from. I was very please to see that! The prices are not bad at all either. 

I ordered the Raw Steak & Meatball Pho for myself. It was very good! The broth is fricken amazing! The meatballs were very tender and juicy. I still can't get over how good the broth for the pho was. WOW!

I also got a order of the pork and shrimp spring rolls. They were served with this tasty nut dipping sauce. Very very good. 

The staff here are really nice and extremely prompt. 

My over all experience here was stellar! I will definitely be back again in the near future to have some more pho! I am going to tell all my family and friends about this joint."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get some delicious pho? This is the place to go. We came here for lunch one day, and I'm glad we did. The place was cutely decorated with a beautiful lighting arrangement. There was a nice patio seating area and an indoor/outdoor bar area as well. All the staff are friendly and helpful. 

The food came in big portions. Usually the pho at other restaurants came in a round bowl. At Pho For Days, they serve the pho in a larger square bowl, which I much prefer because it is much roomier for when I add in my veggies. The broth was on point, I can literally smell the beef broth the minute the waitress brought out the pho. The bun tom thit nuong is also very delicious. I like how they use a bigger types of noodles. I normally have to ask for the bigger noodles at other places. The pork that was served with the bun was very tasty and perfectly cooked.

Definitely will be back here again for some more pho and other delicious dishes!!!"}
{"text":"We got chicken pho from here and the chicken was awful. Not only was it low quality chicken- it was stringy, chewy and fatty. I've never had such terrible chicken in Pho. It was inedible."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I had the chicken pho and my fiancé had the shrimp curry. The chicken pho had no flavor, personally I have had much better pho in Peoria. The shrimp curry only had 5 pieces of shrimp and was just okay as well. To top it off service was not that great either. They never gave us napkins or silverware until we got up and asked for it.  They also brought my finances food out 10 minutes after mine...I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"We went there today for the first time and LOVED it! The atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly! You definitely get a lot of food for your money. The chicken pho was full of flavor!! We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Pho!! This place is seriously delicious. All ingredients are very fresh and you can tell as soon as you eat it!"}
{"text":"Pho for Days.... I could eat here everyday. Great menu, do many choices. I already know what I want next time.  Our waitress was so adorable, she was so willing to answer all our questions

The butter fried chicken plate is huge and very tasty. The F3 marinated pork and grilled shrimp served with fish sauce was the dish I was craving!  But without question the appetizer omelet made us curious... it was amazing

The atmosphere is nice , the furniture is old and it could be cleaner, but the food is a must try!"}
{"text":"Hubby had been craving pho for days (no pun intended!) and even though it was 8:55pm and we knew they were probably getting ready to close we decided to stop by on the off chance that they were open later. We walked in and it was evident that they were getting ready to close but they happily agreed to seat us and we were so glad they did! We both ordered Thai iced tea's and an order of spring rolls to start. The Thai iced tea's were perfect - sweet and creamy and so refreshing. The Spring rolls were very fresh and delicious. The shrimps were plump and cooked perfectly and they had just the right amount of mint and not too overpowering. The peanut sauce was very flavorful and slightly sweet. I ordered the number 10 which came with rare beef, chicken, and shrimp. The bowl was huge when it came out and I knew there was no way I was going to be able to eat it all. Hubby had the number 8 which came with rare beef and meatballs. The broth was very deep and rich in flavor and the side of veggies were very fresh and I liked how they gave you an abundance of basil. Our server made sure to check on us at regular intervals to see if we needed anything. They were very apologetic when they began cleaning and asked us if we would mind the inconvenience. Of course we said no because we knew they went out of their way to allow us to come in even though they were getting ready to close. The restrooms were very clean and they have two outside patios. Hubby and I are looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the ambiance was nice..Love the crab rangoons and the pho tai i ate..My husband did not like the pork he ordered, i forgot the name..Good thing i ordered the large pho tai then we are both satisfied.."}
{"text":"I have been eating pho for a while so I feel like I know good pho when I have it. We went in a little bit after lunch time on a week day. I loved that the sign said seat yourself because sometimes nobody is in the front to seat you. The waiter came over pretty fast as no one was really there at the moment. He was nice and checked in on us, however more people started coming in and we realized he was the only waiter. Service was still good though. I had ordered the shrimp spring rolls and pho with sliced beef. The spring rolls were decent, but it wasn't what I really came in for, I was craving pho. I have to say I was severely disappointed! The broth had no flavor. I had even put in all my veggies and sauces in my pho and I can still taste how bland and water down it was. Also, the price is a bit more pricey then other places I have been too. I wanted to like this place, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I just recently went to the most amazing vietnamese restaurant in Capital Hill, Seattle  and when I came back to Arizona, I had Zero Hopes in finding anything remotely as delicious. 

My husband and I came here and ordered the Stir fry Spicy Lemongrass  Beef Vermicelli bowl and the beef pho and WOOOOOW. I was blown away by the amazing combination of flavor that was so thoughtfully put together into their dishes. The Beef bowl is perfectly seasoned, the noodles perfectly cooked, balanced with mint, fish sauce and fresh vegetables. 

The pho was rich in flavor as well. I will definetly be coming back here time  after time.

The servers were very friendly and the service was very speedy. 

If you are looking for a great vietnamese restaurant in the Peoria/Glendale area, I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place and was very impressed. The place was very big, open and clean. A bunch of tv's and a bar in the corner was a nice touch, along with the outside dining area. The staff was friendly and  helpful since I was with a few others that have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant. I enjoyed the pho very much and everyone in our group was happy with their choice also. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Pho is decent. The price is a little bit more pricy than other place but i's okay. My friend got the beef curry and it was nothing like the curry Vietnamese usually cook. In general the food was decent, the restaurant is clean and well-decorated."}
{"text":"Passed by this place several times but was skeptical to try it out till today. We were brought up knowing authentic Vietnamese food coming from California where there's plenty to be found. It's hard to find good Vietnamese food in Az. I have to say it's very authentic and delicious with what we had so far. I had the beef stew dish with bread and it was delicious.  My husband had the pho and he loved it. My daughter had the fried chicken and rice meal and she loved it.  We will be back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was ok! I think they are overpriced . I've been to cheaper places and the food was way tastier ."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  The Pho was great as were the other dishes we tried.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not real pho, just did not taste good and service was slow for a pho place.  Pho was kind of bland, usually good pho is very tasty down to the broth."}
{"text":"Decided today was a good day to pop into this new Pho joint that opened up by us and I am so, so glad we did! It was delicious - we started with the pork/shrimp spring rolls, which were super refreshing alongside the peanut sauce. I ordered the pho with beef slices. The broth was so good and the beef was tender, and everything was brought out very quickly. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"1st time here. Service: prompt and friendly;
Atmosphere: inviting  price: excellent  
The food was amazing and priced well, attentiveness of server was awesome.  Definitely warrants a return visit!"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice location and atmosphere.
Pho soup is excellent. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Soooooooooooo amazingly good, super fresh and just that Home made taste, had the brisket and beef, beef and meatball and they were delicious, the broth is so full of flavor and freshness along with the shrimp and pork rolls, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I found this new restaurant a great place to try new style Asian food that is clean flavorful healthy everyone should go a try it you won't be let down  staff is friendly plenty of parking and indoor and outside parking"}
{"text":"1.  Very pricy 
2.  Small portion  
3.  The Pho soup is too sweet

However Pho for days' spring rolls are very good."}
{"text":"This place was nice but was definitely over priced. Me and my boyfriend got the exact same things we get at a another place and we get a bigger portion for half the price. Our drinks definitely tasted watered down as well. The place wasn't full of people around 7pm, but they took so long to come to our table and realize we were waiting for the check, then they didn't tell us where to pay or if someone was going to come and pick up our payment so we ended up just going to the front and saying we were ready to pay after sitting there for 10 minutes. The staff was nice but I think we will stick to our regular place."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, and delicious food! Absolutely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and not paying attention to detail at all. We had hair in our pho. We had no flavor to our other noodle dish. The sandwich was filled with overly fatty and gross pork. Although it had good flavor. It was just a mess. 
I will not be back and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I am a devoted pho eater at one specific spot but I decided to broaden my pho horizons. The pho is good, my noodles were just a tad undercooked but nothing crazy to bother me. I loaded my pho with hoisin sauce, chili sauce, and all the sides! I ordered the larger portion for just a couple dollars more and shared it with another person. 

The only draw back was the ambience/decor. I'm sure the same tables from Humble Pie are being used which is fine but I wish they were different and more clean and inviting looking. 

I love that there's a patio! We actually sat outside first but then it got chilly since the sun went away so moved inside before the food came out. 

Overall, food is good. Broth is seasoned well."}
{"text":"Was the BEST crepe I've ever had curry was very good service waitress was very helpful"}
{"text":"Newish Thai restaurant in Peoria. Large-sized portions for a modest price. Food is fresh but bland. Ambiance is good."}
{"text":"Pho was delicious and ban xeo was okay, a little skimpy on the pork n shrimp in the crepe and a lot of bean sprouts but still pretty tasty. Service was decent, nothing over the top, but we were not ignored and were attended to fairly. Cute place has only been opened a little over a month. Very clean and nice decor. I would come back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited for lunch today and probably won't be back.  Service was sllloooowww! We ordered the egg rolls and chicken pho and shrimp, chicken, beef pho and 2 iced teas and our bill was $36!  The egg rolls were ok- came with fish sauce to dip in which lacked flavor I thought.  The pho hardly had any meat in it! I got 3 shrimp, 2 small pieces each of beef and chicken for the price was ridiculous. My daughter had maybe 4 pieces of chicken in hers.  For the price it should've been pa led with meat.  There were also too many white onions in it and it had green onion as well.. definitely won't be my go to pho spot.."}
{"text":"I highly reccomend the beef salad (bo tai chanh). It was very tasty and also a dish that's hard to find in Arizona. I think this place serves the best quality beef in a pho restaurant in Arizona. Every piece of meat is tender and delicious. The downside of getting such quality is that the prices are quite high. Because of the prices I won't be coming back often, but I'll definitely come back when I'm craving beef salad! 

Also, I got the banh mi thit nuong and the bread and quality was very good. However, it didn't come with/or they forgot to add the pickled daikon, carrots, cilantro, and jalapeno. The picture showed that it had it so it may have been a mistake. 

I'm still conflicted on rating the pho. On one hand, you can taste the quality and appreciate the tender cuts of beef. But on the flipside, the broth is somewhat bland compared to other ones I tried in the area. I ranked the pho here higher than Pho Viet, but the broth is weaker than Pho Thanhs. However, the quality of meat here is king.

Edit: I also got the Bun Bo Hue on another visit and was sad that it didn't come with the concealed blood. I suspect it was because of squeamish customers who complained. This is evident by a yelper's complaint below. I reccomend that the option is given to customers on if they want it or not. I thought the bun bo hue was very good, but wish it had the blood cubes in it for authenticity."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Pho I have had in the Phoenix area.  I tried the chicken, which I have never eaten before. I usually stick to the raw beef.  Definitely going back to it.  I will definitley be going back."}
{"text":"Really good pho and delicious spring rolls. The service was very good and our server saved us from over ordering. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre in every aspect. Service was cordial but not friendly, and too laid back for a pricey place that charges $10 for pho. The veggie pho wasn't served with the typical side of sprouts/mint/lime/etc. The broth wasn't bad but quite salty. The veggie bun came with a side of soy sauce mixed with chile paste, not the fish sauce that was needed because it was so dry. The noodles were just all right."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the staff is friendly and helpful when ordering. The rice and pho are super yummy"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the food is good. Lots of Pho to choose from and other food available if you don't like soup. The only bad thing is service is slow."}
{"text":"Pricy but close to Bell or Thunderbird on 83 Ave.  $3-4 more than other PHO. Next to a nice BAR & Ice Rink.  
Mediums size bowl. Spring roll & soup good fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"We went for a rare week night out dinner for my myself, my adult daughter and my 7 year old Grandson.  The service was ok, we had to ask several times for straws and chili oil.  The waiter was not familiar with many items on the menu so hw went to get the manager to explain things to us.  The manager really could not explain many of the dishes on the menu.  We were just trying to order my grandson a noodle dish but no one could describe them very while.  My daughter ordered Pho D - 1 without tripe.  It came to her with tripe.  She did not complain.  I ordered Pho D-7.  It had very little beef, only 3 pieces and tendon.  It had lots of tendon, which is good, but is was sliced so thick and was so tough I could not even chew it.  It was somewhere between plastic and leather.  I am a professionally trained Chef, and the tendon tasted like it was thrown into the pot in the last moment.  Tendon needs to be cooked a long time to be tender.  This tendon could not even been chewed.  Overall, very disappointing.  I paid $55.00 for a meal that we didn't even eat.  The staff and Chef should check out Pho Avino on Thunderbird road for a much better Pho. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Location!! location!! location!! Just got done with my hockey game and walked over to Pho for days. The pho was delicious and Wesley our server was very attentive. I have tried many different Pho restaurants and this one is by far my favorite. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful wether with some good Pho."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for some chicken pho.  The broth was very good, vegetables fresh, overall very good.  Nice atmosphere and the service was great."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! Everything was flavorful and great! Good, friendly, fast service! Tried the beef pho, pork bahn mi and chicken fried rice, plus the Vietnamese iced coffee...we loved them all! We'll be back for sure! Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"The rare beef pho was delicious and perfect amount. The fried rice was well seasoned. We also had the fresh shrimp and pork rolls with peanut sauce. Decor is modern and it'll be nice in the late spring sitting outside."}
{"text":"It's not like I'm an expert on pho - I'm a white dude who discovered pho at a diner in Santa Cruz, CA, had my Vietnamese food horizons expanded in Northern Maryland, and I honestly didn't expect Southern Arizona to continue the expansion, but then I found Pho for Days.

First off, pho not the best dish on the menu - that goes to the $6ish banh mi - very generous on the meat (beef or pork) with the classic smattering of fresh veggies and cilantro, along with mayo on fresh bread. Very delicious and best banh mi I've had in AZ. 

Next best thing I had was a pork and shrimp salad - did not expect that flavor from cold pork and shrimp and the dressing and veggies - very funky and tasty. 

After that, the crab rangoons - what is wrong with cheese and crab filled pastry? Nothing! Don't @ me

Finally, the pho - classic flavors topped with fresh basil, jalapeños, sprouts, and whatever sauce you want to make it yours. So good, don't take the 4th spot as a diss - it's like how Klay Thompson is the 4th best Warrior - he's still an all star!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better pho restaurants I have been to in Arizona. Unlike your average hole-in-the-wall pho place (which tend to be the best), this Vietnamese restaurant's ambiance is high-end and sleek. The appetizer, a plate of 4 small crispy egg rolls with fish sauce, came to the table quickly and tasted fresh/perfectly fried. The Pho Tai and Pho Ga followed, and was served with a very flavorful broth. Overall great food and great service. One critique- not enough noodles in one bowl. The noodle to meat ratio is slightly off. Will be returning, though!"}
{"text":"Great fast service with flavorful food... that I would give 5 stars for. The Pho and fresh springrolls are my go to. 
Why I gave 3 stars: The place is not my favorite atmosphere and the bathrooms needed to be re stocked with soap, napkins and to. So it left me wondering if the employees even washed their hands but luckily I only noticed men were working.
Ill be back...but still have my go to for Pho."}
{"text":"New pho place that just opened! It's delicious. The interior is beautiful. Service was great! I definitely recommend this place."}
