{"text":"I have been looking for a place to get roti close to Leslieville (other than the Real Jerk) and happened across Chefydrew's.  It's only about a 10-12 min bike ride from Leslieville. The chef comes from Antigua but there is a wide range of international dishes in addition to the Caribbean-style/ influenced food. I ordered a veggie roti for takeaway.  It had kidney beans as well as the more usual channa (chick peas).  The thing that made it different than many rotis I've tried was the crisp vegetables - broccoli (yum!) and bell pepper cooked very lightly so that they retained some great texture and vitamins!  This was excellent.  Most veggies in rotis in my experience are delicious but soft. They only had one veggie roti listed on the menu though. To make this roti even better, it would be great to see pumpkin/gourd as a possible ingredient, and to be able to select exactly which ingredients you want in the roti.   It cost $7.95 and it is quite a large size - you could share it with your friend if you aren't super-hungry. Give it a try, especially if you are in the downtown/east part of the city."}
{"text":"Well after reading the reviews here I decided to give it a try.  I find people who are of the same culture as a restaurant they go to, tend to be too harsh, so I went based on the first review and the in depth review he gives on his blog.  I first want to let you know that the low rating is for the most part NOT about the food.  I first went in and there was a large party being served so I ended up waiting at least 15 minutes for a menu.  I had the foresight to ask for water and I think it was a good idea bc I think the guy wouldn't have brought me any.  I had a deal voucher so I perused the menu and ordered, adding up my costs so that I would use the whole voucher and a couple of bucks more so as not to waste it.  I brought my own container bc according the the other reviews, the portions are big and I hate styro.  So the initial guy told me someone else would be serving me.  He told me her name but I forget.  When I tried to order the soup, none of the options on the menu were available.  I was told there was only goat water.  Well, that didn't sound good, so I made my other orders, to her surprise, and told her I would decide what else I wanted in a minute.  A party arrived after me and they ordered the goat water, I had a look at it and it looked really good.  So, when the waitress came back, I ordered it.  Again she was surprised.  It came first.  It was not watery at all.  It was thick and rich and loaded with spices.  Perfectly blended, not too spicy, not too mild and not one spice overtaking another.  Gotta say, AWESOME!!!  Then my chicken wings came.  I forgot to tell her how I wanted them and they came tasting very sweet, which was good.  There were 8 in all.  Then came the jerk chicken,  I was really waiting for a nice spicy dish as I have had at other restos and in Jamaica.  It was so mild that it was milder than the soup.  I was pretty disappointed considering that I had told the waitress that I like spicy, not white man spicy.    Then Chef Drew came out and greeted everyone in the resto.  We had a good chat when  he came to my table.  I asked him about the soup situation and he told me it was Antigen day and there is a special menu for the day.  Goat water being one of them.  I asked him why he didn't have a paper pull out in the menu with today's menu.  he told me it was bc he has an email list of people who know him/his resto  and they are familiar with it.  I pointed out that I had no idea there was a special menu, not was I informed and that it should be in the menu.  I could see he felt bad for me.  Then I asked him why his jerk wasn't spicy.  He said he had a camera and he saw me, so he gave me the mild version.  I told him that I had told the waitress that I liked spicy.  Again, I could see he felt bad.  He told me about some other things on the special Saturday menu and said he would bring me out some samples.      Then the goat curry came.  You know how this stuff is usually so boney and half the meal is bones and grisol?  Well, this dish had plenty of meat.  Again, not spicy for the whitey.  But still delicious.  I was getting pretty full as I had eaten half of everything I was served and all of the soup and all of the sides.  But I still ate almost half of it.  Drew came out quite promptly and brought me a small plate of his specials.  There was a veggie mix, a dumpling and some of his homemade hot sauce.  which, is very, very, VERY HOT!!!  The dumpling tasted like a desert with cinnamon, he said it is usually served with fish and he doesn't call it a dumpling, there is a special name for it but, it is like a West Indian dumpling.  All dishes , save the soup, were served with a tasty side of slaw and perfectly done veggies.  I guess Drew took the hint and added the slaw.  I'm glad he kept the veggies as they were so tasty and not overdone at all.  I don't know what he did to them but they were really good.  The rice that came with the mains was standard rice and peas.  Lots of peas and very good.  Once the service got started, it was par excellence.  All dishes where served in a timely manner, neither being too close together or too long between.  I was well taken care of and my server always came by to make sure I was OK.  The finished plates were always taken away promptly.  OK, now for the reason of my rating. -.25 for waiting so long.  Since there was another server, why wasn't she out to make sure that the other customers were served? -.25 for not serving me spicy when I asked. -2 for way over charging me the prices on the menu.  I ordered almost $27. according to the menu and I was charged $34.  With tax, it came to $40.  Now, I don't mind paying for something if ordered it at the price on the menu, but the jerk chicken was listed at $8 and I was charged $12 and my bill said it was a large.  I didn't order a large!!  There was no 'large' on the menu.   Everything that I ordered was a different price on the bill than it was on the menu.   Hope Drew is willing to rectify!"}
{"text":"I went in to Chefydrews this evening for the first time to get some takeout. Firstly, I was very impressed with the variety of dishes on the menu. For a small restaurant they are serving an interesting variety. The sign out front reads \"International Cuisine with a Caribbean flair\", and that sums it up quite well. On the menu you'll find caribbean standards next to dishes like  shrimp scampi and osso buco (I can't wait to return to try the latter). I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and steamed vegetables, and it really was excellent. The portion was a very good size for the price (7.95), and the steamed carrots and broccoli were perfect- a refreshing change from the usual lump of soggy coleslaw served at most jerk joints. I also had a beef patty which was equally delicious. I had a very pleasant chat with a gentleman who I believe was the owner/manager/chefydrew himself, and the server who was working was also very friendly. Please don't let the area this restaurant is in deter you. It's what is on the inside that matters, and in this case it's very clean, new restaurant serving great food. I live in the neighborhood and I know this is a tough spot to make a go of it. So do yourself and the neighborhood a favor and go support this local small business!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best value restaurants I've ever been to! The food is dirt cheap and the portions are massive.   The name international cuisine is a bit misleading. It's really Caribbean cuisine with a touch of other cultures. For example, they have cajun pasta which is not really Caribbean but a fusion dish. You'll find plenty of Caribbean goodies like oxtail and jerk chicken. The variety is not large but the food is delicious.   The real negative I have with this restaurant is the service and the location. The waitress seems a bit lazy. She'd be off watching TV or whatever she's doing. At times, there's no one tending to the restaurant at all.   This restaurant doesn't get a lot of customers due to its location. It's unbelievable how walking 5 minutes east from Eaton Centre leads to this super ghetto looking area. No other area in Toronto had made me fear of being robbed or stabbed more than this area. I came during day time too. Of the 2 times I've been here, I saw some questionable characters both times in the area.   But as you can see, I only deducted 1 star for bad service and location because it's indeed a fine restaurant if you measure it from a purely food/value perspective. That's what I'm all about. Food and value."}
{"text":"Went here to eat tonight after reading some of the reviews on Yelp and Urbanspoon.  I am from the Caribbean and have a hankering for good oxtail and jerk chicken once in a while that is not by my own hands or that of my kinfolk.    Chefydrew's does not satisfy the palate.  My companion had the lukewarm oxtail and it was just ok.  Missing was the cloves and pimento for added taste, slow cooking till the meat fell off the bone, and the butterbeans near the end for finish.  There was no love put into the oxtail.  My jerk chicken didn't fare any better.  Again, lukewarm chicken drowned in a spicy sauce.  The same jerk sauce you can buy at any grocer and cover your baked chicken with at home.  The rice and peas were \"brown rice and three peas\", then an assortment of brightly coloured vegetables on the side.  Even the introductory garlic bread that Chef Drew himself raved about and gave us was lackluster and I wasn't inclined to have more than a few bites.  After all,  I didn't go there for garlic bread.  Overall, a good place to eat if you don't know any better, but we are STILL on the hunt for a restaurant that serves awesome oxtail, and jerk chicken under one roof."}
{"text":"I have zero negative comments about this restaurant, give or take their website design, but that is just personal taste. My boyfriend lives down the street from this place and I had wanted to try it since it opened, and finally we went. The atmosphere is pleasant, with warm colored walls and Caribbean art, and reggae playing from the speakers. Menu is very diverse, there are a ton of different styles of cooking, from osso bucco (12.95) to curry goat (8.95) , sandwiches (most are 5.95), pastas (8.95-11.95), and steak (14.95). The food is quite reasonable for the portion size, with the most expensive dish being 15.95 (Salmon). The average entree costs between $8 and $13. The food is delicious- everything is made from scratch by the chef, who personally came out to our table to introduce himself after cooking our meals, and was very friendly, along with the waiter. We both tried the oxtail entree ($8.95), which comes with rice and peas and steamed vegetables; it was the best oxtail I have ever tried; the meat is insanely tender and flavorful, and the oxtail gravy accompanying the meat is excellent as well. The desserts are also all made in house, we tried the carrot cake and the tiramisu (both 4.95). Both desserts were perfectly moist, and the carrot cake was a huge portion which is totally awesome. You can tell this stuff is made by someone who cares about the food that they cook, and you can tell that everything is made from scratch, which makes it an even better deal. For two mains, two drinks, and two desserts, our bill came to $38 including tax and tip. I strongly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon Now deal last night for Chefydrews and decided to take a chance since I love Caribbean food and I am so glad I did!  Portions are massive (most mains under $10), flavours were excellent and the service was awesome. The area is a little sketchy and the restaurant does not look the greatest from the outside but it is worth a visit.  I had the Bean Soup ($6.95 for large) and the Oxtail ($8.95). The soup lacked spice but after they gave me some homemade hot sauce it was excellent! The Oxtail was the best I have ever had and there was so much that I almost couldn't finish it (I rarely let any food go to waste!).  I wrote a much more detailed review in my blog but am not sure if posting links is allowed on here. If not, mods can you please edit the link out? http://www.cheapdude.com/food/chefydrews-international-cuisine-toronto-review/"}
