{"text":"I like this buffet very much.Nice service,good food. Thank you so much for this amaising place of relax."}
{"text":"Food is always dry and there are very little quality dishes, but if want to go eat cheap to be full, worth the price, especially for lunch. 
The place is pretty clean, staffs are also nice. I always like their mussels and their salads, but try to avoid their general tao or anything similar to that because there is always too much batter that is fried compared to the amount of meat inside (but then again, many other chinese restaurants offer the same)."}
{"text":"I like it. The Buffet is 11.99$ The food is low-quality buffet food but it's good enough for a quick meal. It's not fancy, not a place for a real good meal but .. if you're just hungry, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Bad customer service . 
Waitresses are looking for tips only . 
Foods are tasty but not fresh and good price.
Totally recommanded for one time try only.
I went there more than 10 times and try all kind of foods and see all of waitresses."}
{"text":"One of my favourite buffets!

There are always many delicious options, and a wide variety of foods ranging from salad bar, to pizza bar, to Chinese food, pastas, steaks, ribs, many types of seafood, desserts, etc. 

The waitresses aren't particularly nice but they are never rude either which is really all you can ask for at a buffet. Also, the bathrooms are not sparkly clean but they're still pretty decent.

The price is a total steal as well. 11$ for weekday lunch, 13$ for weekend brunch, 16$ for Sunday to Friday dinner, and 18$ for Saturday dinner. 

I'm already dreaming of when I'll go back..."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday at 730 for the first and last time food is cold over cooked and seemed like it was food out of a box not fresh made worst food me and my girlfriend ever had"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great, very good value for overpriced Montreal... all of the negative complaints I read I don't understand, I didn't see a single flaw with the place.  The waitress we had was incredibly polite and nice!  Food was great, what more could you want?  

Dont always listen to the nay-sayers until you try a place for yourself"}
{"text":"The place is rated $$$$ probably because the previous reviewer feels like this restaurant being a rip-off. It actually costs on average 15-18$ per person.

So the food is indeed really bad... At least most of them. The fried dishes looked dark and dry, probably reheated and refried daily after staying in the freezer overnight because no one eats them.

The salad bar has very few ingredients and only one type of dressing. The bread they provide were probably passed the expiration date because they are no longer fluffy and were pretty dry.

The soups tasted very mediocre, the meatloaf was disgusting, and the pasta dishes were entirely overcooked. The only thing I found edible was the pan-seared turbot, that was pretty good.

Oh and a staff was actually paid 11$/hr to do one thing and one thing only: cut the roasted meat for you, you are not allowed to cut the meat yourself. The meat don't seem so appetizing anyway...

The service was pretty efficient and caring, which is surprising.

Nonetheless, I will still rate the place a 2-star, because it brings back my childhood memories. It's the closest thing that tastes like my high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"A decent buffet with a varied menu
The price reasonable
Parking is never an issue with the huge parking lot in front of the restaurant
You have to pay for drinks (soft and alcoholic) but water is constantly served
The drink menu is over priced and not worth it (compared to the 10-17 dollar you pay for the buffet)
It is loud but you are not bringing your date here are you ;)
The staff are nice and helpful and they make sure dirty plates are collected from the table as soon as you leave to fill another plate!
It is a good place to have fun with friends and when you are satisfying your animal instinct of eating"}
{"text":"Omg! I ate for a whole day!!
Very good price for a very healthy home-made buffet
I'd say an Italian or a Greek food style
Huge roast beef.. roasted turkey
Big variety of omelettes.. 
cant wait to go on a brunch next sunday))
Try to come at 2pm... the is enough food but before lots of children and crowed"}
{"text":"Pour la propreté et le choix de la nourriture c'est .. boff. Plusieurs personnes m'ont parlé de ce buffet et je m'attendais à beaucoup plus. Le service était .. correct, rien de extraordinaire, comme dans tous les buffets. Je ne pense pas y retourner. Par contre, c'est bien si vous n'avez pas un grand budget."}
{"text":"A clean, decent, and very well stocked buffet for 10$ including free coffee!  The dishes are far from healthy, but you've got all your basic comfort foods and a large salad bar, if you just can't bring yourself to pig out.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is still running?

It's Terrible and keeps getting worse and worse as the years go on."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE:
I went there for dinner on Saturday 19 December 2015 with my wife for dinner. We went there because of the roast lamb special on Saturday nights and because it was our special night. We even called earlier to ask if there was lamb on the menu.  At 1600 we checked in the restaurant and were very well greeted by waitress and host. At our table we were given great service. ONE thing wrecked our whole dining experience. It was the kitchen manager attitude towards me. He humiliated me in front of customers and also in front of the staff . I have never paid to be humiliated. All I did was to ask him very politely about the lamb as it was 1635. He went off at me in front of everyone \" why do you ask for the lamb?\" Why do you want the lamb?\"  He kept yelling these words amongst other things while he was standing at the door leading into the kitchen. We will personally not recommend this place to our friends and everyone we meet. This was so unprofessional. I felt humiliated. I would suggest that he is offered some coaching , some people skills and most importantly some manners."}
{"text":"For a low budget buffet, I guess this is as good as it gets? I'm not exactly proud to say that I ate here, but lemme explain!! My friend and I (with two toddlers in tow) were hard pressed to find a brunch place where the kids would be welcomed. We were not willing to wait in line outside in the cold for Allo Mon Coco down the street. Kids 0-3 eat for free... Not that kids 0-3 eat that much anyway. 

At 11:30am, the buffet does still have breakfast items like toast, scrabbled eggs, sausages, bacon, pancakes, French bread, potatoes, etc. But they also have the lunch menu with fried fish, mussels, roasts, pizza, and other typical buffet fare. 

Overall, food is aight. I don't eat here by choice unless forced by circumstance :p"}
{"text":"Ya know, it could have been far, far worse than it was. I'm still surprised at how many people were hitting this place up on Saturday night because it was jam packed. And I, admittedly, expected the worse because... it's a buffet and buffets are gross. 

I can tell you that this place wasn't gross. 

I'm mostly surprised at all the protein options: white fish, salmon, shrimp (breaded and non-breaded!), mussels, scallops (tf are scallops doing here?!), ribs, tons of chicken done a variety of ways, pork chops, steak (\"steak\"), wings, and a few other breaded meat options. You could do pretty well here if you're smart and don't stuff up on the heinous amount of carb options. 

Rices, pastas, potatoes. Meh. Tons of it. Done in a variety of styles. I actually tried the ricotta spinach lasagna. Meh. 

Not too much vegetable options but that's not surprising. Hotdogs are cheaper than vegetables right now. 

There's also a salad bar, two soups, a ton roasts ready-to-cut, a very respectable amount of desserts, and a pizza bar. Didn't try any of that, but it looked fine. 

Cleanliness? It's fine. Or it seemed just fine. 

Don't go to the bathrooms if you respect yourself. 

I think that's it folks. It was fine. You could do worse."}
{"text":"I'm not always a fan of buffet style restaurants. This one wasn't bad. With buffet-style you can often get a mixed bag: you sometimes get mediocre food and often get cold food. When I went there it was pretty good - seeing what the other reviewers have written I think I may have lucked out. I didn't have a problem with the food temperature - but that might have been my timing.

I thought the italian-style dishes were probably the better prepared ones. I'll agree that the salad bar doesn't have nearly enough options. The staff also wasn't very attentive - they were nowhere to be found at some times."}
{"text":"Ouin oh boy Buffet Vichy..... Hummmm on commence par quoi? L'acceuil. Rien a dire l'hotesse nous reçoit avec un sourire et nous escorte à notre table. C'est après que ca se corse. La serveuse bête comme ses deux pieds ne dit pas bonsoir dépose les cinq verres d'eau et disparait. Ca commence bien. Ceux attitrés a débarrasser les tables le font très bruyamment. La vaiselle n'est pas déposé mais garrocher dans le bac.

Nourriture. Somme toute passage variant de tiède a froid. Lorsque la serveuse vient se faire payer, elle baille sans mettre sa main devamt sa bouche, je me suis senti aspirer ce fut épeurant.

Bref une expérience à ne pas répéter"}
