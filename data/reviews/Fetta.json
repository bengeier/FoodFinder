{"text":"Apparently they believe technology is better than customer service. For their over priced food and drinks go some where else in the airport"}
{"text":"Bien que l'on appréciera le prix relativement correct pour un sandwich assez copieux à l'aéroport ( 8,79 HT), le choix assez complet de différentes salades et sandwich ; on sera néanmoins rapidement déçues par le goût. En effet, le pain sec du sandwich transpirant le surgelé ainsi que le manque de saveurs pourra vous décevoir. Les légumes sont No épluchés ni coupés ce qui pourrait en faciliter la dégustation. Mon sandwich était le chiabbata Egg&Salad&Vegetables mais le snack propose d'autres variétés ainsi que différents mets assez bien présentés en libre service . De plus, encore une fois, le prix reste acceptable malgré que selon moi le goût ne soit pas là."}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches and food.  Coffee drinks are average, however all of the sit down and order restaurants in terminal 1 offer the same."}
{"text":"We stopped in around dinner time, and there was plenty of space. You order from the iPad at your table instead of from the counter. Sandwiches here were generally good if a bit light. Both were quite flavorful, though one piece of bread was overtoasted and too crunchy."}
{"text":"iPads for personal use at every seat - tables and bars.  You Canadians have it real good!  Roast chicken was tasty and herby with crisp skin - nice touch on deboning the breast.  Rapini was perfect compliment.  The Big Easy panini well paired with pineapple.  This place makes layovers feel like nothing- I can be hear hours."}
{"text":"Call me later adopter but this is my first time using an iPad to order food! I actually thought that you need to consume at Fetta panini in order to use those iPads to browse, but no, seems to be open to everybody and Internet is provided by American Express. That say, the interface is confusing,connection slow and the Spanish version of the app used to make the order is just horribly translated. Took some pics for fun. Please do not insult international customers if you don't offer proper localization!  Food: ordered the cheese, mushrooms and apple compote panini and was ok for a pre made one. I would have like it hotter and better pressed. The cappuccino tasted like dirty water, but the server graciously offered to change it for another one which tasted good. The colesaw accompanying the panini was too garlicky. My 4 stars go for the cute and modern factor and the comfort provided plus customer service."}
{"text":"The food is above average quality and inspired, but the portions are quite small, especially for the price.  The portions are small and the pictures on the iPad's pretty much depict that.   The iPad system cuts down on the number of servers required & as a new feature, you can pay at the table is machine after submitting your order.  The machine defaults to an 18% (which can be reduced.. I recommend 6%) tip for a person that essentially comes once to deliver your food and barely utter a word to you. You will never see them again."}
{"text":"The waitresses were all standing around doing nothing, texting, chatting etc while we waited for service. Food was insanely expensive. Ate a warmed up gas-station quality sandwich for 20 dollars. That price included an automatic gratuity... ridiculous. Never again."}
{"text":"The Fetta Sparkler is described as \"Out take on a traditional Bellini, we combine fresh raspberry purée with prosecco for a delightfully effervescent cocktail. $12.50\"  Reality: warm prosecco with a splash of cherry grenadine.   No fresh raspberry purée, no blueberry garnish."}
{"text":"Toronto Pearson has been upping their game recently with a whole slew of new places to eat that offers more than over priced donuts and coffee.  Last year in Terminal 1 international departures area, they opened up a few restaurants attached to celebrity chefs names and Fetta is one of them.  Mark McEwan (of Top Chef Canada fame and restaurateur of North 44, Bymark...) granted his name to be attached to this eatery.  It's unclear if it's actually run by the McEwan group or the airport OTG group.  I suspect the latter as the service isn't up to the same type of attention at most McEwan establishments.  The quick summary is that this is a large step up from the Tim Horten's and Starbucks fare but the bar was set pretty darn low.  The place has a lot of shine and gleam to distract you from the price and lack of service.  They have their entire menu on iPads which is pretty nifty but the interface isn't the easiest to navigate.  A caution to those who order an appetizer and main... if you select the main first in the iPad, it comes to your first before the appetizer.  The iPad does have other neat features in addition to the menu and order, it also shows you flights and allows you to use the net.   The menu is 'upscale sandwich'.  They're mostly pre-made throughout the day and then allows the person to heat them up in the panini press.  Even though they're pre-made, they're not sloppily made or used sub-par ingredients.  My  white cheddar, fig marmalade and arugula panini was pretty amazing for airport food.  I'd order this outside an airport... perhaps not at the $11 price tag but airport food is notoriously overpriced.  The arugula was still crisp and not wilted, the fig marmalade wasn't a sweet jam... instead it had the essence of the fruit which made a nice contrast to the sharp aged bite of the white cheddar.  Overall, great veggie sandwich to eat in the waiting area or even bring onto the plane.  My colleague commented that their wine offering was surprisingly good.  The service though was quite slow... after we placed our order, it wasn't clear if the staff got it.  We had no acknowledgement and so when 15 minutes passed by and we still haven't gotten our order, we went up to ask them about it.  Instead of doing our order, they were rearranging the bottled drinks.  It's a good thing we weren't rushed to go onto a plane!  Also, our mains arrived before appetizers because we placed the order that way.  Our fault partially because we didn't understand the ordering system but when we asked them why they gave us the main first, they just shrugged and said \"I don't know.\"  The service was just really lacking.    I'd like to come back here and try other panini to bring onto the plane but I think if the same staff member is still there, I'd pass and try other places first."}
{"text":"It is a very interesting finding that we could order food or beverage online using the ipad on the table everywhere.  It was said that the order will send to the restaurant and the server will bring the food to you. But after 30mins ,nobody came to me. I went to the bar and they made me a mocha.  The mocha's very good with wipped cream"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. Shortly after we ordered server came around to let us know our food was being prepared. We were not hungry after our meals, the portion sizes were very good. I had the Monte Cristo and it was loaded high with meat. My wife's spaghetti and meatballs was cooked perfectly, the spaghetti tasted like a dream and the meatballs were huge. I will definitely eat here on all my subsequent international flights, especially given the poor options for food at this departure gate."}
