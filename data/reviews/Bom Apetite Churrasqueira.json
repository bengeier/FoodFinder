{"text":"Always pretty good food! Great price. Awesome hot sauce. Love the traditional portuguese food!"}
{"text":"Have been a fan of this place for several years.  Enjoy their chicken  at home and buy two or three chickens and some potatoes  to  share at the cottage.  Everyone enjoys it and asks for  it year after year.  Take out only  Mary"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Portuguese chicken places as I go regularly.  After reading negative reviews I figured it can't be that bad.  So I gave this place a try.  Big mistake.  Overpriced & terrible.  I can throw out a few more negative points but I'm not gonna bother.  You live you learn.  Unfortunately, I can't see this place being around much longer.  Try it at your own risk."}
{"text":"The best Portuguese chicken in the west end.  Chicken is always flavourful and juicy.  Also some Portuguese food daily specials.  I go back every week for my chicken fix."}
{"text":"Passed by for lunch, grabbed a half-chicken dinner:  $10.50.  Comes with rotisserie chicken, rice, potatoes, salad.  Chicken was pretty dry.  Potatoes were cooked thru, but not roasted enough.  They need a little more sear in them, very little flavour.  I skipped on the rice (not sure why someone would put both potatoes as a Dinner plate).  The salad was just taking up space.  Lady piled everything into a styrofoam container.   Chicken layed ontop of the salad LOL.    But it's a small hole-in-the-wall place and the prices are good.  Dont expect much."}
{"text":"Dropped in before the lunch rush started to grab some chicken. They have fire grilled and rotisserie chicken, and the peri peri sauce is great. But the best thing was the grilled whole calamari served with a wonderful sauce - yum! Good value for simple, old school food with no adornments or pretensions."}
{"text":"I think I had the pork chop but I exchanged with the hubby's order which was grilled chicken because I liked it better. I wasn't really impressed. BUT we went there almost at closing time so the stuff they had were probably sitting there for hours now. I saw a lot of potential of what they would've have been had we gone earlier that day. Cuz even at their bad state, the pork chop and grilled chicken were still somewhat awesome. I think the piri piri sauce really elevated the taste too."}
{"text":"Horrible Food. No grilled chicken available, was offered rotisserie instead. They had 3 racks of chicken cooking, 2 racks were dark & burnt-looking yet they insisted it was very juicy. Bullshit. The top rack looked fresh, but he insisted on the darker ones As expected, it was very dry and horrible. Even rice was cold and flavourless, tasted lake they used old frozen veggies (with freezer-burn) in the rice. The feijoada had great flavour but found a 2\" strand of steel wool in it. Go elsewhere, we wasted $25 here."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the grilled chicken because that's all I've ever ordered.  It's kind of on the dry side but quite flavourful and cooked throughout.  The piri piri sauce is more of an oil so if you're not a fan of that, I'd ask for it on the side.  I am interested in trying their grilled calamari and bacalhau but I don't think I've ever seen it on display - maybe they weren't serving it the days I was there.  Just a heads-up that parking is a bit of a challenge because most of the stores in the plaza have spots reserved and you can't actually park on The Queensway. Depending on the time of day, you could park on Brawley (the side street) and just quickly run in and out."}
{"text":"what a mistake. this was the worst churrasqueira chicken we've ever had. I would not recommend this place to an enemy. just awful."}
