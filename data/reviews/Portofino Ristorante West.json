{"text":"Came here with my wife. Lasagna is probably the best I've ever had. Bit pricey for the portions, then again I'm a big eater so I like that stuff. Atmosphere is great as well. A lot of older clientele given its location. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere may be a little dated, it is at the same time absolutely charming. I smiled throughout the entire meal.  The wait staff is extremely attentive and friendly. And best of all the food was delicious and the prices were great!  This has zoomed to the top of our list of favorite places to eat, and yes, we are both under forty!"}
{"text":"Chicken piccata was tasty but veal parmigiana was tough. It's nice to have the option of crisp-tender veggies on the side instead of pasta. We like the garlic toasts."}
{"text":"Being from out of town each time I visit Surprise Portofino is a must stop. The decor could use some sprucing up but over all it's neat and clean. The service is excellent. The staff is very attentive. Always willing to bring you another plate of wonderful bruschetta (and it's free!).   If you go an a weekend in the evening you get to hear the sounds of Buddy Raymond. His tunes add to the ambiance. He is very entertaining. My family has actually become fans of Buddy and look forward to his oldies. We only visit Portofino on nights that he will be in attendance.   I had the pleasure of visiting Portofino last weekend and can't wait till the next time!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage food.  I am really shocked this place has been opened so long.  If you want great Italian food do not go here and I repeat DO NOT GO Here!!!"}
{"text":"We go here on a pretty regular basis and have never been disappointed with the food.  They do a terrific job with pasta, seafood and fish.  The bruschetta is the best in the valley.  Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is nice.  This is one of the few places in the west valley where you have white table clothes and napkins."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very popular, must call for reservations. It is worth a visit. We also \"loved\" the entertainer who wandered from room to room. Great selection of menu items. Will definitely go back again when we return to Surprise in November."}
{"text":"We came here tonight to celebrate Nana and Papa's 67th wedding anniversary with about 50 other people. Nana said the food at the restaurant was very good; and this was her favorite Italian restaurant.   Naturally, I checked this place out on Yelp. 3/5 stars. Yikes! And the reviews weren't very comforting. I didn't have very high expectations. In fact, my husband and I decided if we didn't like the food, one of us would say \"I miss Destiny's Child\". That was code for this place suuuuucks, and we're stopping by In-N-Out later.   We didn't have to speak in code.   I had a glass of the white wine. It was very light, and very enjoyable. We were served bruschetta that was lightly buttered with real garlic, and topped with a type of pico de gallo. We also enjoyed fried zucchini; the outside was nice and crispy while the zucchini was nicely braised. All of the pieces were uniform, and cut the same size. There was also fried mozzarella sticks that seemed standard enough.   The salad was so-so. It was some lettuce, one small tomato wedge, and red onion. The lettuce looked like it came out of a bag. More than likely, it probably was.  Everyone had an entree choice of salmon, chicken marsala, and chicken parmesan. I was expecting the salmon to be dry, the chicken marsala to be overcooked; I figured that the chicken parmesan would be the safest bet. Everyone's dish came out hot.   My friend had the marsala which was generously topped with a mushrooms in a brown sauce. The salmon was also covered in some sort of sauce. It looked very delicious. The chicken parmesan was nice and tender. The spaghetti on the side was perfect with their simple \"gravy\".   The food was only bland because it's Sun City; the elderly avoid salt in an effort to combat hypertension. To prevent orders from being sent back, by an irate grandma, I could completely understand why the chef didn't season everything too much. And, it's not *that* grueling to add salt to your own meal. More than likely, it keeps costs down.  It's not the best Italian I've ever had in Phoenix. But, I'd probably meet Nana and Papa there for a meal if they asked. It's certainly worlds better than the Olive Garden. For being in Sun City, it's probably very popular among the elderly.  The service was on point. The wait staff was good about taking away empty plates, and keeping our wine glasses full. The servers were friendly, and attentive.    While the A/C was on, they could have lowered the temp a lil bit more to accommodate for so many people in their banquet room. Additionally, some of the guests were visiting from other states. They weren't used to the Phoenix heat.  I made the mistake of drinking hot coffee. I was sweating like a stuck pig from the combination of increased body heat, and not cool enough room."}
{"text":"Upon first appearances I was skeptical.  IT is in a strip mall next to a peter piper pizza.... No good can come of this but hey, we drove all the way out here sooo..  Upon entering the atmosphere is a bit dated, like the 50's but in an old kinda rat pack kinda way.   We were promptly acknowlowled by the lounge singer who was taking a break.. Again no good can come of this but we were immediately seated so there was no escaping now.   The wait staff was prompt, worked toegther as a team and my concerns went out the window when the Bruschetta was served.  EXCELLENT.  My hubby brave soul that he is felt a little conspicuous to be the youngest in the room but it is in Suprise, so what was he thinking.   We ordered the Calimari,  it can only go two ways, it is good or it isn't.  While waiting, the lounge singer was doing his thing and quielty belting out Italian tunes with his own particular flair.  Before I knew it I was swaying along to Dean Martin songs and enjoying the atmosphere.... oh no did I just say that ?  By now the Calimari had arrived and been tasted and  I was wrong, there was a third option, EXCELLENT.  Our glasses never went empty and the staff were all quick to ask if everythng was going well.  I had the chicken PIcatta and Hubby had the Manicotti but  instead of pasta on the manicotta they use the lighest crepes I have ever seen or tasted.  Both entrees were delicious and we finsished up with the Tiramasou.   If they were in a more upscale location, they wouldnt be able to keep the prices so reasonable.  I am glad their priority the quality of the food and service.   The important thing to take away from this is that we will be back !!  And recommend that you give them a try, you wont be dissapointed.    I had to lose the one star for location cause it so dang blasted far away from me or I would be there 5 times a week."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will be back!  Yes it is a mostly older crowd but you are in Sun City!  Thoroughly enjoyed listening to the live renditions of all my favorite 50's artists such as Louie Prima, Sinatra and of course Dean Martin!  The food was excellent as well as the service!  Zach was our server and was Johnny on the spot if we were in need of anything!  We were a little weary before we went because of all the mixed reviews on here but we had a great time!  The ONLY draw back was the calimari...I found it a little too chewy....but there HAD to be a glitch...right!  Be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went to Portofino West because my husband heard it was good.  Went on a Tuesday night for the Spaghetti special.  I looked on their web site and decided I wanted something different.  When we got to the restaurant the prices were much higher than the website.  The service was excellent, the bread was great.  The dinner was just ok.  The sauce was bland to me and the eggplant was paper thin and mushy.  My husband had the spaghetti special with meatballs.  His complaint was the same as mine, the sauce was bland.  I grew up in an Italian family so am used to a flavorful sauce.  We'll go again and try something different, give it one more chance."}
{"text":"This is what Italian restaurants are supposed to be like. The smells of fresh garlic bread and pasta, white tablecloths, fine wine, tasty appetizers, wonderful selection of main dishes, fine wines, and health pours on the well drinks, and terrific service at a very reasonable price with wonderful ambiance. Just doesn't get any better for the money!"}
{"text":"We ate here four times during the winter (we're snowbirds).  Food and service are always good. We had tickets to a ballgame and needed to get in & out quickly and our server (Alex?) jumped into action.  We had bread immediately, quickly followed by drinks and an appi, then he thoroughly described the specials and guided us to tasty entrees which were quickly on the table.  So appreciated!!  The food and service have never disappointed us!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Kinda like a family Italian joint but too bright inside. Food is good enough for what it is and service is sufficient. Food is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Not great not bad. Cutesy place with an \"almost\" feel. Experience it for yourself. You will understand what I mean."}
{"text":"We found a gem between the 99cent store and a knockoff chucky cheese.   Food was delicious and more authentic than most. We got our food quickly on a busy Sat night.  Hostess had the right accent, was quick efficient, friendly and helpful.   My husband ordered his go-to, sausage & peppers. The sausage & sauce was great. Not as impressed with the veggies and run of the mill noodles.   I asked the waitress for her opinion on 3 dishes and told her to surprise me after 3 descriptions that all sounded wonderful.  She chose a crepe manicotti for lack of a better term. It was exactly as she described.  Delicious and perfectly made though with the creme sauce a bit heavy (as she told me it would be).  I'd stil order it again in a heartbeat.  Loved the tiramisu. Then again, I usually do.  Gentleman singing & playing guitar in the front was a little loud, though good.    We would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim ...had a great time!  Super friendly staff... really nice atmosphere and great entertainment. We were seated promptly and the server was helpful with specials and menu choices. Everything was delicious...water glasses re-filled...and abundant smiles throughout. We were extremely satisfied with our first visit and will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is the last time we will eat at this restaurant. I took my 93 year old friends Larry and Faye out to eat. It was Larry's birthday. Larry is an ww2 veteran he is on the SS Saint Louis the only ship that survived Per Harbour.He is an author of the book The Luckiest Ship in the Navy. Saga of the Lucky Lou. I'm telling you this because it's a sin and shame how they ruined his birthday. We ordered?  2 palates of eggplant parmesan 15.95; each they split and ordered mashed potatoes as a side they also ordered one coffee and one tea.  I asked the waitress would it make a difference if they were to order separate meals would it better on the price. She replied no. We got the bill. It was 63.00. we complianed they said there were 1195 splitting charges and every thing else. We complained she said it was in the menu e  At 93 years old how could you expect them to see small print. They offered to adjust the price. Yeah a big 3 dollars. Real nice"}
{"text":"Portofino is a quaint little place who's owners are hands-on and it shows in the food and service. We stop every time we can when we are in town. Bruschetta is great, calamari is light and crispy, salads are tasty too.  I love the entrees- eggplant parm is great, clams and linguine is yummy too. My Dad was a regular here and the entire staff treated him like a king. I love this place!"}
{"text":"First timers to the lovely little gem in Surprise!  It was everything we were looking for.....ambiance, music, great service and delicious food!  We were celebrating an anniversary and felt the evening was perfect.  Our friends had made reservations so there was no waiting.  As we saw entries at other tables we asked people what they had and would they recommend.  It was like a love fest with everyone chiming in that everything was good!  We visited with the singer/guitar player who has been the entertainment for almost 20 years!"}
{"text":"I realize that declaring Portofino the best Italian  restaurant in Surprise isn't much of a compliment. It's only competition are the franchise joints and a few mom and pop pizzerias. Nicks Diner? Let's not even go there. But despite the tacky pink and gold 1950's decor, and the musty  odor, there are some very good aspects to this place. Lets begin with the service. Always excellent. The staff works together seamlessly. The bruschetta that comes to the table quickly and in nearly infinite amounts, is really good. The stuffed tilapia special, is a creamy crabmeat filled delight and available almost every weekend. The veal parm, yes veal parm, where else in Surprise can you order it, is tender and generous with tasty breading, cooked perfectly in olive oil. The seafood combinations are small portions and just OK . The accompanying pasta portions are also kind of small and the marinara is sweet and lifeless.  But the menu here is way above average for this area.  OK, so the abundance of old people does not make this place an option for a first date, unless you're 70.  Hell, I'm 57. When I walk through the door I feel like I'm crashing my parents new years eve party.  You may even trip over a walker or two on the way to your table. The lounge singer croons the latest Perry Como tunes. But, he's good at it, the food is relatively decent, the house wines are serviceable, and prices reasonable.  I can deal with the atmosphere and I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"It's nice to see an \"old fashioned \" authentic Italian restaurant.  The atmosphere is like going back to Grandma's house and the food just as good. Young people, just wait until 7-7:30, the old farts will be gone. Haha. Very nice place."}
{"text":"Ambience was really nice. We had wonderful service from Margie!  Food was awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So the history of my reviews will show I typically do not write reviews like this.  My girlfriend and I arrived and were promptly seated. It was about 7pm and not crowded. We ordered the Escargot, Oso Buco, and Fettuccine with Mushrooms and Shrimp. I had the spinach and egg drop soup, her the salad.  The Escargot was very good and we asked for bread. Specifically asked for plain bread (should have been brought out with Escargot due to the large amount of garlic butter that usually accompanies it. Took a long time as for some reason they assumed I wanted it toasted. Not a biggie. Escargot tasted great.  This is where it got bizarre. My girlfriend liked the shells and wanted to keep them for a decoration. Assuming we owned the Escargot we just ate, we asked for a box for the shells. The server stuttered quite a bit trying to tell us the shells weren't for sale. What?? Essentially you RENT the shells and they are reused for other patrons!   The manager came over to see if she could address the issue. I told her we'd like to take the shells and she said it was not possible that they reuse them for other guests. I was so surprised at this and questioned her reusing something like that. It's not a fork. I asked her if they were allowed to do that? In my opinion it's disgusting.The manager was entirely rude and wouldn't discuss it further. One of the worst encounters with a manager I've ever had in my dining experience. She walked off and would not answer me. So much so, I just had to ask for my bill to leave.  The Oso Buco and Fettuccine just arrived at that moment as we told our server (very nice girl who we did tip) we were done and leaving. The manager still refused to speak to me upon departing.  So for the $3.00 likely cost for six Escargot shells, the manager easily lost $40 for the meal, possible returning customers and possible future customers who will read this review. Not a bright business person at all.  The food was good, but due to the attitude of the management, I would never step foot in this restaurant again. They get 1 star....because I have to."}
{"text":"The bread they serve here prior to dinner is some of the best I've ever had.  The perfect combination of garlic, olive oil and tomatoes. Food is very tasty, and the daily specials are always right on the money.  I'd give this place 4 stars, but the ambiance is terrible.  4 star food -1 star ambiance  3 stars!  Note: if you can wait to eat until around 7pm, most of the \"early bird specials\" have cleared out, and it will be much less busy.  Coming at 4:30 or 5:00?  Be prepared to wait behind your grandparents..."}
{"text":"Our first time at this Italian restaurant.    The service was good and the food was good.   Noodles are made there.   The owners go to Italy every year for new recipes and new ideas.    Yes there is an older crowd but it is in surprise so that is expected.   We would go there again, for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant.  Simon is charming and the wait staff is pleasant and courteous. Very nice to sit at a table with cloths.   The food is delicious and presented nicely.   Since I can't get back to Italy,  I have Portofino Ristorante."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is great, as is the service.  I also greatly appreciate the class and manners of the people who dine here.  An all around wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We ate here 6/5/16 and were impressed. Best bruschetta we've ever had. Very good Italian food reasonably priced"}
{"text":"One major thing I dislike about living in Surprise is the lack of unique and interesting restaurants to eat at, not to mention the lack luster nightlife.  Everything in Surprise is about chain restaurants where every building and every dining area pretty much looks the same.  Even the food is the same because it all comes from the same distributors.  No wonder why the menus all look the same wherever you go.  I don't know how many times we have been served by the same server despite being at different restaurants because apparently they have multiple jobs at multiple restaurants.  You can't even get a different server in Surprise!  But that is what you get when you live in a town run by senior citizens.  That being said, Portofino Ristorante West is a break away from the typical chain restaurants in Surprise; however I write this with a lengthy clarification.  The restaurant itself is located in a rundown shopping center adjacent to a Peter Piper Pizza.  You know the restaurant.  You know the clientele.  You've been warned.  This in and of itself does not make Portofino very attractive from the outside.  However once you get past the fist fight occurring in the parking lot and the woman vomiting in the garbage can by the front door, it's not that bad.  When you enter the restaurant, you are often greeted by an elderly lady wearing a fancy sequence gown.  When this happens please resist the urge to run away.  Don't panic, you are in the right place and yes you will be able to afford the food at this restaurant.  She dresses this way only to shame those who come dressed in camouflage pants, Metallica t-shirt, and flip flops.  Even though I was wearing my nice Metallica shirt, I still felt a little uncomfortable standing next to her in that dress.  Honestly, I appreciate her efforts to jazz the place up a little.  I realize that she is trying to promote a classy upscale image for the restaurant and its guests.  Moving into the dining area she may take your arm; however this is not too lead the way, it's because she literally needs help walking because she is in such pain from the fancy shoes she is wearing.  Poor thing.  As you enter into the dining area you will pass by a guitar/singer who looks and sings a lot like Burt Bacharach.  Look him up...I didn't know who he was either.   It is at this same time you will suddenly feel very, very young as the average age of the clientele here is about 91 years old.  It's funny, my wife and I laughed at some of the comments people posted about this place and we absolutely concur!  Most of the clientele here were passengers on the Mayflower and if you are under the age of 60 you probably will not feel very welcome here at first.  My wife and I have visited this place several times and every time we walk into this place we feel the cold hard stare of disproval because of our youth...and we're in our forties!  If you come with kids it's even worse.  Just put on a big smile to show them that you mean no harm and move towards your table in a slow and deliberate manner.  As long as you don't make any sudden movements you will be fine.  Note: if you under the age of 60 they may try and seat you in the back of the restaurant, but don't, request a table up front like a real human being.  Besides, the Burt Bacharach guy is kind of good.  You don't want to miss his axe work.  Don't worry folks, once you are seated the music will start up again, the chatter will return to peak level, and soon all the patrons will forget that you are there.  The décor in this place is a mess with a hodgepodge mismatching framed pictures, furniture, and knickknacks.  It feels more like grandma's house than it does an Italian restaurant and if you are like me, eating at grandma's house always comes with some hesitancy.  In many ways, it is like stepping back into the 80's except that I am still bald and my knees still hurt.  And again, if you are anything like me, you will quickly realize that the carpet in this place is most likely the same carpet from the 80's which will pretty much occupy your thoughts for the remainder of your time at this restaurant.  I accidentally dropped my clean napkin on the floor once and was afraid to pick up due to the uncleanliness of the carpet.  The waitress passing by tried to pick it for me and I screamed \"FOR GOD'S SAKES WOMAN DON'T TOUCH IT!  Leave it there.\"  Needless to say, this place is in dire need of some redecorating and perhaps some cleaning.  Now on to the menu...the menu offers a wide variety of Italian and French style cuisines in which everything that I have tried has been excellent.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly.   Overall, Portofino offers quality food, but unfortunately not much else.  The guitar/singer is a nice touch, but then again I am somewhat of an old soul and enjoy music from generations before me.  Before you leave, try their deserts, they are excellent and don't forget to step over the puke on your way out."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time.  Excellent!!!  This is now our \"go to\" restaurant for Italian food.  Cannot wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 people last week and I must say the service and quality of food was really good. They seated us when we expected and provided us the opportunity to enjoy are family members 60th anniversary and not rush us to move on. This place has been good every time we have gone. Take a chance and enjoy."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a bit like stepping back in time.  I was the youngest person in there and I'm no spring chicken!  There's a gentleman with a little amp and guitar in the corner crooning out some easy listening for your dining pleasure.  It's very 80s feeling.  Free bruschetta, very good. Salad comes with entrée, and my companion asked our waiter for the dressing recipe.  They had lamb Osso Buco on the specials board at 18 bucks.  I've paid $30 for it at other restaurants and this rendition was excellent!  It was over pasta but the lamb shank was the star.  It fell off the bone and was very flavorful. Friend had Shrimp Scampi over linguine.  Nothing exciting, but it was executed well. Friend mopped up the Scampi sauce with a dinner roll, so I'm assuming she was satisfied.  For dessert they had scoops of homemade ice cream and we shared a pistachio one which was very good too.  It is way on the west side, like way. But there's a kind of David Lynch-y  vibe in there I dig."}
{"text":"Never have I ever experienced such fantastic service with each and every visit! The setting has a old school feel with white linen layered table clothes, waiters and waitresses are dressed in crisp white dress shirts & black ties. After only our first visit (a couple weeks later) we were greeted by name by a waitress who remembered us. On Friday & Saturday nights a sweet elderly man sets the mood with Rat Pack type music. Once you are seated by the owners (a husband and wife team from Italy) they bring you complementary bruschetta. Everything my husband and I have ordered has been perfection! Real, authentic, simply amazing, Italian cuisine. By far my favorite Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was their fried zuchini.  The homemade Manicotti was tasty.  Small place but elegantly decorated with white tablecloths."}
{"text":"I seriously try to find the best in \"not so great\" situations, but last night was a killer. A group of us went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant has been around forever, but they have changed hands, and I was forewarned that the food was mediocre, the servings were small and the prices were high. Oh well, everyone wanted to try it, so I went. Being an Italian restaurant, how wrong could it be? YUCK! I ordered the Veal Marsala (how can you ruin veal with white wine, butter, lemon and capers?) How about using \"pressed\" meat?! There were two strips of the mystery meat with a little pasta with ketchup sauce (or was it gravy?). The brucshetta - not kidding - was melba toast with wet tomatoes...nothing else. Sound tasty so far? One of the girls looked at me, and I at her, and we just shook our heads. Then, we never-ending masochists, thought we would try the Tira Misu for dessert....lady finger sandwich with pure sugar in the middle...one bite and none of us could gag it down! When we asked the waitress to please remove the desserts, she bellowed \"That's how it should be!\" Fortunately, the Manager took the price of each ($7.95) off our bills. When the check came, I should have burst out laughing, but.....far be it from me to embarrass my friends....until they all cringed! The pressed meat and pasta ran over $30 dollars! And, after the waitress bellowed at us about nothing being wrong with the desserts, we still had to add on a tip! As we left, my friend and I got in my car, while the others left in theirs. She looked at me and - so help me - she said, \"Let's go to XXXX for dessert and coffee! And we did...then we went shopping and walked off the \"meal\". Maybe I'm spoiled having been raised in an Italian neighborhood, but it was absolutely the worst meal I've had since the days of salmonella! Should have had my homemade minestrone and stayed home..........."}
{"text":"Atmosphere really nice we love the tablecloths so choose this restaurant to entertain company. Wine list good usually order a carafe of house wine. My husband always orders Veal Parm or Linguine with Clam Sauce. Soup or salad included with entrees salad is very good. Pasta or vegetables included with entrees I usually have the vegetables my husband always has the pasta.  Tonight we tried the lasagna the lasagna noodles were very over cooked and smothered in thick red gravy.  I will definitely return but never order the lasagna."}
{"text":"Amazing service, atmosphere and food.  We will be back Stuffed tilapia and spaghetti.   Mmmmm Don and Cindy"}
{"text":"There is something about an Italian restaurant when you walk in. The aroma of garlic! Tomato sauce simmering. Do i notice the clientele or the decor? Heck no! I just want to taste all what my senses are craving. And that is exactly what this restaurant does to me. Robert was our server and he did everything possible to make us comfortable in his home. Yes that's his job, but he takes it seriously like it's his business and that is what a good waiter or waitress is going to do. The bruschetta to start is amazing! Soup or salad is the bomb no matter which one you get. I try not to fill up with either because I know what's coming. This time I got the chicken Marsala. Not one but two juicy chicken breasts with mushrooms and the awesome Marsala wine sauce. I opted for the vegetables instead of the pasta. Done perfectly with a crispness but not too raw. The white tablecloths and napkins add so much to the dining experience. Please don't ever change! I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Man this place is really a mixed bag.     The pros: Service is excellent.  Bruschetta is really good, and the dishes I have tried have all been from good to great.  Good specials and very reasonable prices.  The cons (and unfortunately they are SO con they bring it to 3 stars): If you have ever seen the show restaurant impossible and the big muscle man walks into a place for the first time and is stunned by the decor that is this place!  This is definitely your grandma's house with less character.  Stuff everywhere, no consistent theme, pastels, dark corners, and the list goes on.    As others have said, Surprise is a mix of young families and retirees/snowbirds.  If you go to this place during snowbird season and you are under 60, you are GOING to be the youngest person there.  I can deal with that, living here you get used to it from Nov-April.  What I do not like is what seems to be a constant attitude by the clientele of this particular restaurant.   I do not see this at other establishment in Surprise that the snowbirds frequent.  Another review said you will get \"the eye\".  I get more like the evil eye!   I have 8 & 10 year old kids who we have taken here and that mere act gets you dirty looks like you just invaded their personal space by entering the door.  I cant quite put my finger on why THIS restaurant seem so much more intensely snowbird driven than others, but it is enough to keep from going back more a few times a year."}
{"text":"The unfortunate thing about living in Surprise is that you're usually the youngest one in the place.  Okay, there was a baby there one night. Pshaw.  The complimentary bruschetta that comes to the table is the best I've ever had.  Just the right amount of garlic and tomatoes, and really fresh.  They have good specials and a tasty meat sauce.  My item of choice is the lasagna.  Saucy!  The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, what with the pastel pink walls, mirrors everywhere, and a retired guy singing old Frank Sinatra songs and cliche Italian ballads.  The hostest greets you at the door in a sequinned dress like you're going to a banquet, while all of the patrons are in golf shirts and shorts.  Wicked.  It's not the most happenin' place, for sure.  Decent food for a really good price.  I don't mind going  once in awhile, but as a young person you will expect to be given 'the eye' by a retired person here and there.  Maybe they're expecting me to get drunk and dance on the tables?  Geeze, you do that once and they never let you forget!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place did not have the best food. I do not recommend the shrimp pasta, it came with super tiny canned shrimp for salads and not very many of them. I was wanting a seafood meal and this was not it. We were the youngest group in the whole restaurant but it was picked as an overall middle of the road place for a large group of people driving from all around town. The service was ok. I did not pay for the pasta dish as it was not good at all but I definitely paid $6 for the super small side salad that came with the meal. Overall I do not recommend this place although as stated in another post they have the best bread ever and the rest of the guests at our table seemed to enjoy their meals. I tasted my husband's food and it was way better than mine."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a long time because we moved to a different part of town.  We visited tonight.  I ordered my old favorite, spaghetti with marinara ($9.95), but with pesto sauce instead of marinara.  The waiter asked if penne noodles were okay, I said sure.  When I get my bill, I'm charged $14.95 for \"penne pesto\".  The service was REALLY slow and we had to go so I didn't argue at the time.  I later called the store to speak with the manager.  The first lady I spoke to said she would look at my ticket and fix it.  Later the \"real manager\" calls me back and says that pesto is more expensive sauce and that I never asked the server what the price was.  I told the manager that he had the opportunity to reclaim a customer, but that as it stands we don't want to come back.  He said fine, don't come back.  Ok, we won't."}
