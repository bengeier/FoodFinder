{"text":"Tasty food, beautiful warm atmosphere and really really friendly owners! I love the fries and the souvlaki!"}
{"text":"Really suprised this place doesnt have any positive Yelp reviews (or any reviews at all for that matter). Great food, attentive staff and the med fries are a must! I prefer the chicken souvlaki over the gyro."}

Decor (5/5)

This place has very cozy feel, the interior is very fresh and modern with subtle touches that give it that Greek feeling. Most Greek restaurants really over do the \"Greek\" theme, but this got it right. 

Service (4/5)

Our waitress was very nice, great personality, very attentive to our needs also. The food did take awhile to arrive and the restaurant was quite empty at the time.

Food (4/5)

The pita bread was amazing. We got the Calamari (5/5), spanakopita was amazing (5/5). The entrees we ordered was Chicken Pita Souvlaki, the chicken was very tender (4/5). Pork souvlaki (4/5)

This place is a nice addition to downtown Whitby."}
