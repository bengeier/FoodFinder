{"text":"Disappointment -- We took our son and fianc√© and their children to the Church St. N. location last night with consideration of booking a wedding rehearsal dinner with catering in the banquet area in late May. After having 2 glasses of tea spilled on my wife by the wait staff at the start, we thought that at least the food order for our group of 8 would have been correct. It took at least four attempts to make sure everything was on the table when the order began to arrive, so the total order was delivered over about 15 minutes. The food was good, but not memorable -- Probably because we were thinking about so much else about the overall experience. No concessions for the multiple service and order problems were offered. We left an OK tip anyway. We are looking for another option for the rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!   And for the other review, the vinegar based sauce is on the table!"}
{"text":"Heading into Concord on Church Street, Troutman's is on the left. This is their main location and you'll notice the cook house in the rear of the parking lot. They still cook their BBQ on site, I think they still use wood but not positive about that . Troutman's is an old family run business and has been serving BBQ for many years. The provided a heaping sandwich which was very tasty. The slaw was good and my bun was toasted. I had two sandwiches and tea for $8.51. The service was good and the food was good too. The building could use some updating but it's a good place to stop in and taste BBQ the way it should be served.  BBQ education; there are two NC styles of BBQ:   Eastern mostly whole hogs slow cooked over wood and sometimes gas and served with Brunswick stew (beef and chicken with vegetables), slaw (either yellow or red), corn bread (either hush puppies or corn bread sticks), white small potatoes or fries. The sauce is usually vinegar based with some added spices especially red peppers. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled.   The other mostly in western NC is usually pork shoulders either slow cooked over wood or gas. Gas is becoming a popular fuel to conserve wood and the air quality. The wood adds some great flavor and many people don't want it any other way. Pork shoulders are smaller cuts of meat and cook in less time. The cooked meat usually is served with a mayonnaise based slaw, fries or on a sandwich. If you order a basket or tray you usually just get BBQ and hush puppies. If you order a plate you get fries and probably a side of slaw. The sides can certainly vary... so ask. The sauce is usually thick and red, based with ketchup some added spices especially red peppers and vinegar. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled.   Many area restaurants now offer BBQ Chicken and beef brisket (mostly a Texas dish) along with pork spare ribs and beef ribs too. These items are not typically found with true NC family BBQ establishments... mostly the larger ones trying the satisfy more people with their offerings.   Since Concord and Charlotte are in the middle of the state... you will find both types here."}
{"text":"Is it the best BBQ I've ever had? No.  Is Troutman's an institution? YES!  We stop here on the way into town EVERY time we visit. My partner gets the pulled pork plate and I get the sandwich. We slather both with the vinegar-based sauce (which is usually on the table).  We usually pick up a large to-go order for our evening meal the night before we leave town.  5 stars for being an institution! As I get older, I appreciate places like this more and more."}
{"text":"I got a sliced plate. I was not fond of their red slaw- have had much better. But, the meat was tender with a good flavor, the French fries were good and the hush puppies are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the word barbecue in their name.   It's more of a family restaurant,  although they do have some barbecue.  The menu had 28 side dishes-  so pretty much anything you'd like.  I had the ribs- I don't think they were cooked in a pit and the sauce was thin.  They tasted good but they are not cooked in the style of modern barbecue restaurant.  The food was certainly a throwback to the 70s family style restaurant.  Meatloaf.  Fried chicken. Mashed potatoes and gravy."}
{"text":"I just moved into Concord and this place is across the street from my place. The staff is very friendly and know what they are talking about when it comes to what you want.   It's great for the price and and it does leave you wanting more. I would suggest staying with the BBQ items and when you order it to go make sure you put sauce on it.  Banana pudding is amazing though!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here one day. I love Barbeque and he said this place was an institution. The barbeque was okay. It had  a good smoky flavor but it was a bit dry. When I asked for vinegar sauce the waitress brought me a plastic container of white vinegar. I was confused as most Barbecue places have a container of red vinegar sauce on the table already. I don't know if they were insulting me or I had insulted them. I probably wouldn't go back. I prefer Richard's Barbeque in Salisbury."}
{"text":"Went the other day. Solid old school barbecue. Old school feel but clean. Prices were reasonable.  I Give the barbecue sauce a \"C\" unfortunately. Needed some zing and got meh."}
