{"text":"Terrible service and overly foamy cappuccino. The woman at the counter was incredibly rude towards me and my family, and wouldn't even let my grandparents sit down before badgering us to order something. My cappuccino had over three inches of foam on top, which I had to wait over 20 minutes to dissipate before I could drink the overly bitter coffee. Never returning!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet little place, rustic furnishings, friendly service, calm music, good selection of pastries. And coffee in a ceramic cup! What a treat for a Starbucks-weary American tourist. Not surprisingly the owners speak fine English."}
{"text":"Nice quiet spot with great coffee and nice bagels. Great place for breakfast if you want to feel like a local."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast / lunch with a friend! Good food and good service - everything was excellent! My one complaint is there could have been better vegetarian options for the sandwiches. But all in all, and excellent cafe!"}
{"text":"Very relax place with relax underground music, gentel service, coffees , chai , cappuccino and patisseries availables, good spot in the area if you prefer a local store..."}
