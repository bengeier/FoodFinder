{"text":"I ordered a sandwich today for the first time and I was disappointed to learn that butter, cheddar cheese, and regular lettuce were not available for sandwiches.  In what kind of world is there no butter, cheese and lettuce to introduce the turkey to the bread?"}
{"text":"Come here 2-3 times a week. Extremely friendly staff, amazing food. Cant get much better than this when it comes to quality, freshness and affordability. Highly reccommended."}
{"text":"Perfect. Staff are always friendly. Selection is endless. Food is super fresh. I have always enjoyed the sandwiches and salads. My favourite lunch spot by far. Oh did I mention fast? Service is quick and food is fresh. Just like the name."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE quantity provided for the value of your meal. If only you could see the photo I took of how a $9.00 salad got me half a container of salad. All options are extra pricing and they give you little to none of that topping. Today was my first and last experience with this company.  Do yourself a favour & save yourself from making a mistake, DON'T eat here!"}
{"text":"Great for what it is, which is a spot to grab a quick and healthy lunch. I go for the salads mostly instead of the sandwiches and there is lots of variety. I tend to stick to more or less the same combination (spring mix with corn, broccoli, beets, chickpeas, couscous and tuna) but it's always tasty and the assembly line set-up gets you in and out quickly at lunch time."}
{"text":"Although this place is expensive for a sandwich and a small salad ($11), I still crave it.   Their sandwiches taste so fresh, my regular is a grilled chicken on rosemary focaccia with Brie cheese, Goat cheese, avacado spread, roasted red pepper spread, tomatoes and mushrooms.   The salad is small, however, the dressing on it is yummy! There is always a line up and I despise that they only take cash between 11am and 2pm - so inconvenient!"}
{"text":"After hearing about all the hypes of this new food court at Eaton Center, I finally get to come here for a lunch this weekend.  There is a good variety of vendors here, really impress by the healthier choices too!   I picked Fast Fresh Foods today, because I'm trying to watch out for my diet, summer is here soon. I ordered a large custom salad to share with my boyfriend. I think their custom salad is priced very competitively. For a small custom salad, you can pick 5 different basic toppings and it's only for $6 ish, and for medium you get can pick 6 toppings and large you get 7 toppings. You can pick your own vegetable base (lettuce, romaine, spring mix etc) and dressing. For toppings, within the basic toppings, there are tonnes of choices, pinenuts, sunflower seeds, almonds etc, and then cherry tomato, couscous, apple, tangerine, olives, cucumber etc If you want to add proteins (chicken, turkey, avocado, tofu etc), they charge like $1.50 - $2 each...but they give you one big cup of it for each order.   And finally, they will throw it into a big salad mixing bowl and mix it up for you, so there's no messiness of trying to mix it up in a small bowl by yourself. Everything was really fresh for us this time, hopefully they can keep it up!"}
{"text":"Last year, while at the Eatons Centre, my friend had a sandwich from here. She swore it was the best thing she's ever had. A year later, I decided that I should probably give it a go. I was impressed. I usually get the olive bread with sundried tomato, mozzerella, grilled chicken breast with mushrooms and tomatos. It is so good! It is a bit on the pricy side (~10.25 w/ tax) but that's alright. It is a change from grabbing Subway. If anyone has any recommendations to try here, give me a shout!"}
{"text":"Was ok, but I think it's a bit misleading to advertise their salads as \"load on ingredients!  over 40 ingredients to chose from!\" but then when you get served they tell you that you can only have four ingredients and anything more is an extra $1-$1.50 per item.  I fully understand that some ingredients should have an extra cost (protein, some cheeses etc) but the basics should be unlimited."}
{"text":"I used to go here very often, and really like the quick service, given my work schedule BUT the quality of their food REALLY TURNED ME OFF.  I ordered the kale salad which was a new item (or was not advertised well before as I had not noticed it). I added my usual toppings and tried a new sauce.  Bring my food back to work and I taste SAND IN MY SALAD!!! They probably didn't wash the kale properly.  Obviously this was a bummer, and even though I honestly frequented this place, the sand thing has rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't speak about the salad bar because no one makes friends with Salad. Their sandwiches are amazing! A sandwich (comes with a side of spring mix salad) comes up to $10.00, drinks excluded. This is pretty average for downtown Toronto. If you're looking for a good sandwich, I would highly recommend this place. The only thing is make sure you go when it isn't busy. Once it does get busy the sandwich spends less time on the grill and it isn't as crispy as it should be."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm done with this place, and there chincing. They wouldn't let me get half chicken on  a salad, because it's against the 'rules'. Didn't appreciate being told I could't have what I wanted, especially since I've spent hundreds of dollars with them over the past  year, nor did I like getting scolded in front of a line of people for asking for something custom. Then they didn't mix my salad properly and it ended up just overall sucking."}
{"text":"Had the Roast Beef sandwich today and I was not impressed.  There was hardly any Roast Beef on the sandwich.  It was pretty tasteless as well.  The only good thing was the salad.  A big change from my first experience.  If your craving Roast Beef better walk on over to \"Rare\" which is just almost across the way form this joint."}
{"text":"They have a basket of rolls at the checkout. After paying over $11 for a salad and a can of coke, I asked the cashier if the bread was included. She said no, it's an extra $0.54.   The salads and sandwiches taste good, don't get me wrong, but I think you can get a more affordable and equally good (if not better) lunch elsewhere.   The salads are primarily lettuce, and you only get 5 additional items (particular items that don't cost extra) without incurring extra charges. For example, cheddar cheese is the only cheese that doesn't cost extra.  And don't even think about asking for avocado without paying extra. At Freshii you can add a lot more to your salad and pay a lot less.   And if I'm paying over $11 for lunch, I think you can throw in a piece of bread."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is the place to go if you want a consistent okay sandwich and salad combo. Fast Fresh let's you build your sandwich from scratch, allowing you to choose your bread, spread, meats, cheese, and veggies. You'll always know what your getting in terms of quality as the ingredients are fresh. The only complaint is that the sandwich and salad is a bit on the pricey side at about $10.50 after tax. You can also order custom salads as well. However, I have only been here for sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is a review of the salads (I'll update when try their soups and sandwiches).  Ordered a large custom salad with mixed greens, and my choice of 7 toppings, with salad dressing on the side. Greens were very fresh - no wilting leaves in this bowl.  Wow, it really is a huge salad (I'm comparing to Freshii, which seemed to have caught SSS (Shrinking Size Syndrome).  Yes, if you get meat and other 'charged' toppings, the cost will add up. Yes, they could probably give you more toppings (granted, I've never been totally happy with the amount of toppings I get in salads).   Compared to other places I've been to, this is a good deal. A large salad, with no charged toppings will cost you $8.75 and a day full of grazing.  Cash only is from 11-2. I had no problems using my Mastercard after those hours."}
{"text":"A pretty decent, if unexciting place for a sandwich. The menu has been the same since I started coming here 18 months ago and has not changed a bit (apart from the prices increasing that is).  Their bread selection is decent (multigrain, wholewheat, wrap, focaccia etc) and their spreads are pretty good. I usually go for the chipotle or garlic aioli. There is a large selection of cheeses and meats, and a few veggies to go on top.  It would be great if they had a daily special sandwich as I find the menu a bit boring and repetitive to be honest. A sandwich with a side salad works out at $10 including tax, which isn't too bad. The lineups can be long during lunchtime but it moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"FFF is good for a quick $9 salad.   I find this location gives more salad than the FFF on Yonge or the Freshii in TD Centre - so bang for the buck it is probably the best. It is hard to not be full after what seems like an entire head of lettuce plus toppings.   I typically avoid the long line by selecting the pre-prepared salads (they will mix them with dressing for you). I am usually in and out in under 3 minutes.   $9 salads can add up - but when you're in the PATH most everything is going to cost you $7-$10."}
{"text":"they have started chincing on the toppings big time ... today I received three slices of cucumber in a large salad.  After raising their prices by 50 cents for a large ($8.75), one expects more than just a bowl of salad greens.  Also extremely annoying is to stand in line while all the servers either ignore you or sit there CLEANING up the display even though there happens to be five or six people in line waiting ... certainly they could do this after the mad lunch run dash."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot - fast and tasty. I've had the chicken burrito twice and was pleasantly satisfied both times. The meat is seasoned nicely and the toppings are fresh. Came to $10 incl. tax."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch since my work is right beside the mall. It is one of the truly healthy options available in the food court (no, subway sandwiches are not considered healthy).  A sandwich and side salad combo will run slightly over $10 and a entree salad for about the same. Both are delicious and highly recommended. Everything is customisable as well.  Staff are friendly and work really fast to keep the line moving. They can get annoyed at people who don't know what they want so make sure you read the menu before holding up their long lunch lines.  Highly recommended for anyone looking to be health conscious and still have a tasty lunch."}
{"text":"This is the only place I get lunch from in the food court.  I love the sandwich + salad combo.  I was walking to the food court with 3 other friends, and without saying a word we all walked to Fast Fresh Foods.  Then we started talking about how much we like it.  This is my order (try it an tell me what you think):  whole wheat bread, spicy chipotle, turkey, goat cheese, eggplant or roasted red pepper, and banana peppers.   I'm drooling.    I'm pretty sure Sandwich Box was around first, but I like FFF better."}
{"text":"Got a salad there today. Toppings behind the counter didn't look good - especially the tomatoes which were turning brown. Taste of the salad is far from great. Most probably will not return to Fast Fresh."}
{"text":"This is my \"big salad\" go to spot for lunch at work. I always feel better eating a salad as it does a body good. This salad is huge. There are 3 sizes and the large is about $10 with chicken. You pick your type of lettuce - romaine, spinach or spring mix ( or all 3 if you like). With the large salad you get 7 toppings. I'm a fan of the beats, black beans, corn, broccoli, carrots, celery, peas and various croutons. You can add chicken, turkey, salmon or tuna and various types of cheese. They have a wide selection of dressings and you can indicate how much you want on your salad. They put all your chosen ingredients in a big mixing bowl so everything is mixed well. I have a big appetite and this is the only salad that fills me up!  Warning - the line gets very large during lunch hours so I recommend going around 11:30 or after 1:30. They are also open later in the evening so also a good late night work dinner. They also sell sandwiches but I never tried them so have no comment.  BK"}
{"text":"Being at the base of a 56 story building means that this location has long line ups.   Much longer line ups than the nearby Yonge Street location, but the salads are prepared with move love and more lettuce.  Focusing on upscale sandwiches and Salads, this location is perfect for the starving lawyer with an assistant that can run out and grab lunch while continuing charging outrageous hourly rates.    As a plebe who fetches his own lunch, I completely avoid the sandwich line.  The sandwiches are great here, but not worth the wait and my proletariate background prevents me from paying $10 for anything called a sandwich.  But the salads are great.  If you avoid the add-ons and stick with basic veggies, you end up with a great salad at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Urban Eatery, and my first time at a Fast Fresh Foods - and I really enjoyed both!  I love that the Urban Eatery is greener than most food courts, using real plates and cutlery.  That gets major points in my books.  But, this is a review of the restaurant not the food court, so I won't talk about that too much.  After a quick tour of the offerings, and knowing we had reservations for a big bbq meal later that night, my brother and I wanted to keep our lunch light and chose Fast Fresh Foods.  Glancing at the menu, I quickly realized that this was no Subway sandwich shop!  You chose from a selection of gourmet breads, choose one meat, cheese and spread, then choose one option from each of the prepared and fresh veggies.  I had roast chicken with brie on rosemary focaccia with avocado spread, caramelized onions, and arugula.  They then lightly toast the sandwich and serve it beside a generous heap of mixed green salad.    As someone who has worked the 9-5 for a few years now, I get pretty bored with sandwiches.  In fact, I haven't made myself a sandwich in over a year.  But these sandwiches were delicious.  I only have a couple of comments/complaints.  I wish I had been asked if I wanted my sandwich brushed with oil before toasting - I would have preferred it not been.  I also wish the toasting could have penetrated through the bread to the ingredients, to melt the cheese and warm the meat (hey, Subway does some things well!).  And I wish I could have added more veggie toppings.  But, for about $8.50, you could do a lot worse.  A little expensive for a sandwich in my opinion, but not ridiculously so.  I would definitely consider it the next time I'm shopping around lunch hour."}
{"text":"Okay, I've never been to the Sandwich Box, but now that I see that people are calling Fash Fresh Foods a rip off of it, I totally have to check it out.  I was working late on Bay Street tonight and as usual, I found myself hungry and stressed because I had alot of work to do and it always frustrates me when I have to find food to eat while working late because there's never anything closeby to eat on Bay Street after 5PM -all the food courts close and the restaurants are too far away from the towers. When working OT, the key is to grab something quick and get back to the desk up in the office tower and work work work until the job is done done done.   Since the Path is completely useless at 7PM, I took my 15 minute food adventure to the surface, outdoors, with the falling snow.  As I ran towards the Hero Burger near the corner of Yonge and King, I saw the sign for Fast Fresh Food, so I opted for that instead. Hero Burger is great, but it would take them forever to make me a veggie burger, a salad would just take seconds.   It was my first time here but the chalkboard menu was really easy to understand: you either build your own salad (regular or large sizes to choose from) or you order one of their salad designs or you order one of their sandwiches. Having virtually no time to scan through the list of ingredients of each of their salad designs, I went ahead to build a regular salad. My salad consisted of:  -mixed greens -capers (what was I thinking? it was a sans salmon salad!) -chickpeas (gotta have some sort of protein if I don't want my hair falling out) -olives (kalamata olives, full, non-pitted -i hate spitting the pitts out of any fruit/ veggie, but I love olives and couldn't resist) -roasted eggplant (love marinated veggies!) -cherry tomatoes (i wanted chopped ones, but they didn't have any) -balsamic vinegar -salt and pepper to taste  It was a good salad, but nothing too special. The only thing special about it is that I built it. There are some things I wish they had considered:   1. Have chopped up options for tomatoes and olives. I really believe that veggies should be diced up in a salad, not thrown in whole like the cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives.   2. Have more veg protein alternatives: Tofu and avocadoes don't cut it. And they should do something with the Tofu, I'm not paying $1 extra for plain tofu!  3. Consider not charging $1 more for veg protein, it costs way less than meat protein. Stop trying to rip off vegetarians/ vegans! Life is hard enough in this meat-eater's world already! There's no need to further punish us for our healthy life-style choices!  All in all, despite some minor setbacks, it was a good salad and kept me satisfied until OT was done. If I'm working OT next, I think I'll pack an extra lunch so I won't have to go through the stress of figuring out what and where to eat after all the foodcourts close along the Path. But if I forget to pack an extra lunch, I might just come back here. The service was meh, but it was quick, and speed is very important when working after hours."}
{"text":"sooooooo bad. service sucks, salads poorly mixed, and staff clearly don't care."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Cobb salad I ordered.  I didn't want egg included and they were nice enough to let me substitute for another item but the lettuce let the salad down.  The iceberg lettuce used was soggy and either old or left sitting out at the wrong temperature for too long.  For an $11.00 salad it was definitely not worth it. Next time I would request romaine be used or whatever looks fresher."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot.  What can I say?  It's a decent custom-salad place.  I'll give 'em a higher rating since they're open pretty late.  They got lots of great sauces, custom options.  Had a sandwich once or twice from them and the bread is crunch and good.  If you want no-guilt but quick, tasty lunch, then come here.  For what it does, it does it pretty well."}
{"text":"Eaton Center - Urban Eatery  Very rarely do I have a taste for a sandwich and when it hit me recently, I decided to come here after reading all the glowing reviews.  I went with the sandwich + salad option, which comes out to $10.25 after taxes.  There is a lot to think about and they try to make it easy.  1. Choose a bread and a spread 2. Choose a meat and a cheese 3. Choose a prepared veggie and a fresh veggie  Bread: fancese roll, multigrain, olive loaf, rosemary focaccia, whole wheat, whole wheat wrap  Spread: avocado, basil hummus, curried apple, roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, and sun-dried tomato  Meat: roast beef, proscutto, salami, chicken, turkey  Cheese: havarti, smoked cheddar, mozzarella, asiago, brie, goat  Prepared Veg: caramelized onion, grilled eggplant, portobello mushroom, roasted red pepper  Fresh Veg: argula, banana pepper, fresh tomato  My selection: Focaccia, sun-dried tomato, roast beef, smoked cheddar, grilled eggplant, and argula.  The bread was so hard I almost passed out trying to take the first bite.  I think that just ruined the entire thing.  The roast beef was ok and the rest didn't add up to much flavor.  I was hoping the sun-dried tomato would do something, but it just added weirdness to the texture.  The salad was good and I liked the dressing.  It's probably a good thing I don't have a taste for sandwiches often."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty good but a bit on the smalll side  and light on toppings.   Their inspiration Sandwich Box is still a bit better.   I would probably give 3 stars if not for the fact they are cash only. I don't understand why in 2011 some places insist on inconveniencing their customers to save a few bucks on merchant service fees.  It's especially cheeky for a place that charges $10 for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really, really love FFF for the salads. It's great value for the quality, the number of (and variety of!) toppings, and sheer volume of goods. A large salad is LARGE and with no extra charged toppings to the 7 that you're entitled to - the monetary hit is a modest $8.75.   $8.75. I'll let that resonate with you for a bit.  See, ya just don't get the whole package for that price point at Freshii or Druxy's or Sandwich Box or salad bars in the PATH supermarkets (Longo's, McEwan)! (You're welcome, yes, I did the high-level comparables analysis! :P)  I like to get the kale salad with avocado (charge), corn (x2), chickpeas (x2), banana peppers, and cherry tomatos (x2) with 1/4 lemon poppyseed + olive oil + lemon dressing. I don't get protein with my salads because I find better value in nearby grocery stores :)   Graze away!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see such mediocre reviews. The sandwich I had was among the best I've ever eaten. (Perhaps partially due to my ingredient selection ;) The accompanying salad was a welcome surprise. One of my office mates got a salad the size of his head and could barely finish it.  However, now that I've heard of Sandwich Box, I'll have to check it out to compare!"}
{"text":"Fast Fresh Foods is only available in downtown!  There are two locations in the downtown financial district and I always prefer going to this location rather than the one in Commerce Court.  Why?  It's because this location allows you to use credit card for purchases during lunch hours!  I seriously do not understand why the commerce court location does not allow customers to use credit cards during lunch, I assume it's to save the commission cost?  But it's so inconvenient to NOT allow customers use credit cards now a days in general.  They serve salads and sandwiches but I have only tried their salads before and the salads here are great and fresh!  They allow you to do three substitutes from the classic salad menu (provided the items you are substituting cost the same) or you can build your own.  I usually go with the regular Chicken Ceasar Salad with three substitutions; I will substitute mushrooms for croutons, avocados for bacon bits and Japanese Soy Dressing or Asian Sesame dressing for Ceasar dressing instead.  I personally think this is the best combo, is healthy and it tastes great!  That salad I just mentioned will cost you $10 exact.  You may argue, you can make your own salads from home for so much cheaper and bring it to work, yes, you are right, but there are some people like me who HATES bringing lunch to work cause it makes our bag bigger and heavier!  To sum it up, if you are in the downtown financial district and want to have a healthy lunch with a wide selections of toppings for salads or do a DIY salad, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The price is a tad on the steep side ($9.50 for a sandwich) but if pressed I'd say it's worth it, at least once in a while if you want something better than Subway. I usually go with a vegetarian sandwich on rosemary focaccia with smoked cheddar, caramelized onions, arugula, tomatoes and roasted red peppers with a garlic aioli spread. The bread, the fixin's, everything is very good and really does come to more than sum of its parts. The side salad that accompanies it is decent but I wish I had my choice of dressing...not a huge balsamic vinaigrette guy.  The salads are equally good and can be a meal unto themselves, especially if you go with a large like I do and add some protein. Great selection of fresh toppings, salad bases and dressings. My go-to will usually be their house blend (equal parts romaine, spring mix and spinach), with broccoli, carrots, cherry tomatoes, chick peas, mixed peppers, red onions and roasted corn, with perhaps tofu or avocado added on. I'll finish with a mostly ranch dressing with just a touch of poppyseed added for flavour. It's all very good but be careful if you started adding things like Tofu, Avocado or sun-dried tomatoes...they're all extra and you'll soon end up with a pretty expensive salad.  So while it definitely is fast and fresh, not to mention healthy and tasty, it can be a little dear if you get carried away. Enjoy but be careful if you're like me and enjoy a salad with lots of toppings."}
{"text":"They have started chincing on salad toppings... I actually had to endear myself to the salad creator to get more than 4 slices of apple. On top of that, they now douse the apples in lemon juice--I get it, it prevents them from going brown, but they go overboard and now my salad tastes purely like lemon juice. A coworker just walked by and asked what the acidic smell was that was wafting from my desk. Seriously. Enough with the lemon juice. CUE JONI!! *I don't mind spots on my apples leave me the birds and the bees, pleeeaaase*  Why are there no good affordable salad options on the PATH?! :("}
{"text":"Pretty much a popular lunch spot for those working in the Financial District.  They have separate lines for salads and sandwiches, which are customizable.  They have quite a wide selection for bread and 2 choices for soup.  I love how they have an avocado spread.  My turkey-avocado-mushroom-tomato-mozzarella grilled sandwich was delicious and came with a free side of garden salad.  Seating is limited but turnover is quick."}
{"text":"$9 for a lunch (excluding drink) is fairly average lunch price in the financial core. The sandwich comes with a green salad. I prefer this sandwich shop over others. The ingredients are visible and I've never seen anything wilting.  I tend to always get the olive bread with avocado salsa (previously basil humus), turkey breast, goat cheese (I do try all cheese except gouda), portabella mushrooms and arugula. Delicious! And filling. Two key criteria because the last thing you want, is a hunger pang around 3pm and stressing over the work you need to accomplish.  The salads are filling but those are actually expensive and little value for price, because I order extras that are not covered in the standard prices. Unfortunately, I haven't looked elsewhere for other salad places.  I recommend it for sandwiches but not for the salads."}
{"text":"First Lettuce/Freshii introduced us to the $10 salad.  Then the likes of Reggie's etc introduced the $12 sandwich etc.   Now, I can add FFF to the list of outrageous lunch prices.   My simple sandwich and soup was $13.50!  For takeout!     I'll admit the sandwich was tasty and well-prepared (rosemary focaccia, curried apple spread, turkey, brie, and roasted peppers) but the soup was a little bland and left my mouth tingling as though it had been full of MSG.  Who knows?   For the price/experience ratio, I think this falls quite short of Petit Thuet, but then you'd have to venture out of doors.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Fast Fresh has to be one of my Go-to's for a quick and easy lunch. This location is my new favourite as the staff are so pleasant and generous. My 2 options are either building my own salad which is always fun or getting the sandwich/salad combo.   When I feel like some Carbs then I'll get a sandwich, only on Olive Bread. Staff will slice 2 thick slices of Olive Bread, slather on Chipotle & Garlic Spreads, Turkey Breast, and I usually get roasted red peppers, portobello mushrooms, Brie & Mozzarella (brie for a creamy base) and banana peppers. Also always get yours extra toasted. The sandwich is always so good, I suggest you try mine and then play around :)   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"This place is sufficient and fairly good for the days I forget to bring my lunch to work. The food is fresh and seems a bit more 'homemade' and not as preservative ridden as many of the deli's around. The sandwich spreads are a change from the normal mustard and mayo and the cheese, bread, and topping options slightly more artisanal.  You pay the general \"I forgot my lunch\" premium of $10.00 for a sandwich and small side salad you could have made yourself for half the price. But still this $10.00 sandwich is a little more tasty than other financial district lunch sandwich/salad spots.   Verdict: Sandwiches are tasty but salads, while options are a plenty, are kind of forgettable."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches here are amazing! They have a really good selection of toppings where you fully customize your sandwich to your liking. The salad that comes with a sandwich is very simple/back that's the only thing I would change. Their soups are also really good here. Highly recommended for a quick and healthy option!"}
{"text":"Frequent this place and have to say that the sandwiches keep me coming back for more. Always done very well and the staff are extremely friendly. My fav sandwich combo: Rosemary focaccia with a chipotle spread. Toppings: Turkey breast, arugula, asiago cheese and portobello mushrooms. Makes for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: This location doesn't have the crazy line that the location in Commerce Court does. Sure you have to go outside, but it might save you 20 minutes from standing in line. Oh, they also take debit during the lunch hour as opposed to the Commerce Court location which cuts off debit at lunch.  The salads here are a little pricey and they're huge. Even the regular size is more than you'll probably need. You can choose one if their pre-built options and tweak as you like or just make up your own from scratch. I usually go with the chicken caesar with spinach instead of romaine, which always seems to throw them off for some reason. Either way, it's delicious and filling."}
{"text":"I could literally eat here everyday!  Some weeks, I nearly have.  While there are umpteen options available to any hungry downtowner, I'm a serious creature of habit here.  I usually get one of two things   MY salad: large spring mix with chick peas, beets, cherry tomatoes, roasted eggplant, feta, sunflower and pumpkin seeds with balsamic vinegar and olive oil - $8.25  or  MY sandwich: roasted turkey on rosemary focaccia with sundried tomato spread, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and arugula. (always comes with a huge portion of greens with balsamic vinaigrette) - $9.00  Kids, this place is the answer to your healthy lunching dreams!  Totally reasonable pricing for what you're getting, and it is indeed fast, fresh food.   Occasionally, you'll get a trainee fixing your food and they might be a bit on the slow side, or screw up, but really, if that's the worst thing that happens, you don't have much to complain about.  Beats greasy, carb coma-inducing Chinese any day.  Looking forward to more outlets opening around town.  This business is already catching:)"}
{"text":"Fast Fresh Foods is one of my preferred food court vendors in Toronto as everything is quite tasty and it doesn't make me feel as guilty when I eat at subway.  The service is very prompt and the design of their menu is clean and straight forward.  The sandwiches taste very fresh as the vegetables are vibrant and crisp.  My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep as you end up paying over $10 after tax for a small sandwich and soup.  Although the ingredients are probably quite premium compared to Subway's I feel that I would only eat at Fast Fresh Foods if I wanted to splurge on lunch."}
{"text":"Quick. Healthy. Nice staff. Good food. Around $10. Awesome for lunch!  The sandwich box for $10 gets you a healthy sandwich with Ace buns and a side salad. Lots of veggies.  Modern cheap great place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place at the Eaton Center food court. I always go for the custom sandwiches here.  Basically, you get to choose your own type of bread or wrap, spread, meat, cheese, and two veggies. My usual is a whole wheat sandwich, with low-fat avocado salsa spread. Then, I add grilled chicken breast, french brie, roasted red pepper, and arugula. It comes with a salad drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. The ingredients are fresh, and the portions are decent. It's a relatively healthy meal that's filling and makes me feel less guilty compared to other options in the food court."}
{"text":"Meh. I have to echo everyone's comments... this place totally copied The Sandwich Box, right down to the size of the paper boxes and everything.   So this pick up place has probably only survived because of convenience and proximity to many offices. When I went this afternoon it was full of people in business suits picking up dinner to bring back to work. I don't know when they close, but by 5:30pm they start wrapping everything up and seemed irritated to have to unwrap them for me (even though there were lots of other customers after me).   There are 2 sections: salad bar and make your own sandwich.   The salad bar looks pretty standard. The woman in front of me got one and I must say they are HUGE. I don't know how it could be eaten in one sitting. If you don't want to build you own salad, you can also get a set combination. They are very predictable and standard -- chicken caesar, nicoise, greek.   I opted for a sandwich instead. For $9 (incl tax) you get a sandwich with 3 toppings (1 meat, 1 cheese, 1 vegetable) and a small side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The bread selection is okay, not great. They did use a lot of ACE bakery breads. There are a bunch of spreads. I tried the apple curry, but it was a lot more bland than it sounded. Do not get the grilled eggplant!! It is salty beyond belief and then you can't taste anything else. Just looking at the vegetables behind the counter, I was not impressed. The tomatoes were very unripe and yellow/orange-y. It was an okay sandwich, but I could fix up something better at home.   They also sell hot soups, brownies, fruit, and chewy bars.   Seems this place is popular, despite its mediocrity. I saw that during busy hours they had to organize 2 separate lines for salads and sandwiches. They also have the option of phoning in your order ahead and picking it up. For people in a real hurry, there are pre-made salads in a fridge by the cash ready to go."}
{"text":"Ever since this location has hired a bunch of new staff, my \"regular\" sized chicken Caesar bowl is never full and I am still charged for its regular price (the amount of lettuce provided is laughable). I feel like I have a small salad in the regular bowl and still made to pay for the premium. Staff is courteous and the quality is good though..."}
{"text":"I don't like this location as much as the other two but at least they have private seating (not in a food court). The space feels a bit uninspired and institutional. They provide nutritional info on their website, which is more than I can say for most places. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at this location, but if you're in the area you could do worse."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch because it seems to be one of the healthiest options under $10. They actually post nutrition facts online (hint hint, La Prep). The rosemary focaccia for sammich goodness cannot be compared to the average Panini anywhere nearby. Generous side salads and friendly, quick service make this a mighty fine bet in my books."}
{"text":"On a normal day, for a \"regular\" Fast Fresh, I'd give a 4-star. This location, however, is absolutely baller!  Not only is the food good and you have quite a bit of choice as to how you want to customise your sandwich, but this location has the biggest portions I've seen at any Fast Fresh!  The super nice lady who works the sandwich bar during rush hour is definitely generous to the customer: slabs on a tonne of sauce and puts a good portion of food on there. It is just way superior to any other locations I have been to (so far three).  I will be coming back, and I will be hoping that the sandwich bar lady will be there every time!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich and salad combos in the path. Comes out to be $10 and you get a custom pressed sandwich and a side salad. The sandwich is great. I usually get turkey, roasted red pepper spread, arugula, brie and eggplant, toasted for extra long. Its satisfying and delicious. The line up goes by fairly fast and worth the slight wait while your sandwich is pressed."}
{"text":"I had to write an update to my review as a few things have changed and I had the chance to try out the sandwich side of the restaurant.  Regarding the sandwiches - they're custom made, just like the salads but the ingredients list is very limited, but has some very intriguing options, including Rosemary Focaccia (yum!), two whole wheat bread options, avocado salsa, roasted garlic aioli, prosciutto, turkey, french brie, goat cheese, caramelized onions and grilled eggplant, among others. There's about 6 different choices per category and you get one type of bread, one spread, one meat (or substitute meat for extra veg x2), one cheese and then your veggies. I ended up going with Rosemary Focaccia with garlic aioli, no meat, and goat cheese, caramelized onion, grilled eggplant, arugula and tomato. They oil it and then grill it on a panini press while they prepare your salad (with balsamic vinagrette) to go on the side. All in, its a cute little box meal that doesn't LOOK like much but sure packs a punch.  Flavor on my sandwich was amazing, they seem to have picked just the right ingredients for the sandwich side that would all feasibly go together to make a wicked sandwich. The goat cheese was warmed through and just a smidge melty and everything else sort of melded together on my walk back to work. Genius... just genius. The side salad is a decent size and although my sandwich looked small w hen I opened the box, it definitely did the job for a late lunch on a day I was very hungry.   A few things that have changed recently - they're giving out less of each salad topping as they used to (although this is probably a good thing for my waistline). While the portions are still really good, they're not amazing like they used to be. And I noticed today that the prices went up. Nothing astronomical (I think my meal with tax was 0.25 extra) but its worth noting for people who frequent this location.  Overall, this location is still a winner for me. I go here at least twice a week and a few of my coworkers have started going here as well. It's nice to find healthy food that's fresh made and right to order. Probably the healthiest place to eat in the food fourt (and by far one of the best)."}
{"text":"Fast Fresh is such a great lunch option! There's so many options to customize your sandwich (My favourite combination is guac/garlic aioli on Rosemary focaccia with asiago cheese, grilled eggplant, tomatoes and arugula, so delicious!)   All sandwiches also come with a generous sized mixed green salad with a balsamic dressing. I think this is a great deal for just $10!"}
{"text":"A really good quick option for lunch in the path. The sandwiches taste really fresh and are made to order. Grilling them is great it adds a nice crunch and melts the cheese/warms the meat really nicely. The salad could be improved upon. It is a mixed salad with a basic vinegar dressing. For $10 though this can't be beaten for a quick lunch to bring back to your desk."}
{"text":"The quality of ingredients at this location is sub standard when compared to the Commerce Court location, however the prices are the same. The meat products are not the same and I have found the lettuces to be old and soggy. I won't be back."}
