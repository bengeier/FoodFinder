{"text":"The best and most scenic happy hour in Scottsdale.
This was our third visit to the Silverado Grill.  They have the absolute best happy hour in Scottsdale, and the most scenic.  The happy hour food is the best and the prices are unbelievable.  We used a Restaurant.com coupon and got $51 of food and drink for $26.  Our server/bartender was Sonia and she is one of the very best servers I have encountered, and I have dined out in all 50 states and 10 foreign countries.  She also made one of the very best cosmos I have ever had.
Two tips:  get a restaurant.com coupon and go on Friday or Sunday so you can get Sonia."}
{"text":"To be honest, I would rate this establishment at 3 stars overall.  But since they participate in the restaurant.com program, I give them an extra star due to the value you receive when using a restaurant.com voucher.  This is the 4th time we have dined there.  All four times we have used a voucher.  The food is good as far as golf club/grill food is concerned.  Some of their sandwiches are very good --- the BLT and the Club sandwich especially, and they come with either French fries or onion rings.  Their Rueben is mediocre at best.  Their SW grilled chicken salad with ranch dressing is excellent.  Yesterday, I tried they breakfast which was OK, but their omelet was pretty sad looking -- it was flat and a little burnt.  But it tasted OK.  It came with home fries, a small fruit cup, and a nice, big, nicely buttered English muffin.  I have no complaints and will continue to go to eat here as long as their continue to participate in the restaurant.com program."}
{"text":"We used a restaurant.com certificate at Silverado Grill, and ordered a burger and onion rings and a Santa Fe chicken salad. Both entrees had nice-sized portions. Our server was very friendly. We would eat there again, especially if we had a restaurant .com coupon."}
{"text":"What a lovely setting - my sister was trying to find a new location to have brunch with family.  The golf course is situated in the middle of a residential area, so you have to be determined to find it.   We sat on the patio and had a beautiful view of the fountain and greens. 

The menu is very typical of a golf course restaurant. Service was delightful - very friendly.  I ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs, and others ordered French toast, and various versions of bacon and eggs.   The chef came out to apologize that their oven just went on the brink and offered me options for biscuit replacements.   

The food arrived promptly and everyone was pleased.  The Bloody Mary was decent but nothing special.  

Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for brunch/lunch.  The food is good and the service is fine.  It's a good deal if you use Restaurant.com vouchers."}
