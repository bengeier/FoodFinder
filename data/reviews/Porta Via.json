{"text":"A fast and healthy option for lunch.   They are very committed to a healthy fresh offer and the staff and highly engaged and service oriented.  Love the self serve fresh bread!  Seating area could be warmer."}
{"text":"This place makes the best salads ever! Homemade pear dressing is to die for! Great customer service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location many times and I am always completely satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food,  All the ingredients are fresh and the soups are so tasty.  It is an excellent healthy \"fast\" food option, without the fast-food grease and heavy feeling afterwards.  The owner is a friendly man and you can tell that he truly cares about his business.    I wish the price was more kind on the wallet, but sometimes you have to pay for quality.  My favourite paninis are the Premium Smoked Salmon, Tuscan Chicken & Bistro Beef and Brie... but I still have quite a few more on the menu on my list to try :)    I hope this place stays for the long haul, it's a great work lunch option!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch in Porta Via for nearly two years. I was a great fan of it for a long time. The sandwiches are full of flavour however a bit expensive and the salad sometimes is not fresh, which is a disappointment after paying $11. There's a place on Matheson, \"discovered\" last week by a colleague which serve similar sandwiches, salad of your choice $3 cheaper. Sorry Porta Via I don't mind paying $11 as far as my salad is fresh!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is made fresh. This is my go to place when I don't have time to pack a lunch. No guilt trips here! I got the bistro beef & Brie grilled panini with salad as the side. I loved the salad dressing! Staff is friendly and very helpful. Combo cost me $11 bucks with tax."}
{"text":"Lunch at Porta Via is simply amazing!  The fresh and uber healthy ingredients! My love for this place started at their first location in Etobicoke during my stressful days learning the ins and outs of being a Flight Attendant- they do more than just serve drinks! Always looked forward to my Fridays where I would buy my lunches here.  For an entire meal about $12 (sandwich, soup, and drink).  Homemade soup, quality gourmet cheeses and artisan bread (ACE bakery). No cold cut sandwiches- carved meat- turkey, chicken, sirloin, smoked salmon, seared tuna...list goes on about 20 types of sandwiches on the menu.  They also make a mean salad- no boring bowls here. Extensive toppings offered with lots of protein choices and house made dressing- try the balsamic!  If you're wanting to try Porta Via I would recommend visiting the Etobicoke location nabbing a parking spot is much easier than this location as it is situated inside an office building and also hard to spot from the outside looking in.  Be warned both locations are limited in seating. Arrive just before lunch or after as this place is always packed and for good reason!   I don't work anywhere near a Porta Via but would definitely stop by if I had a day off from work. Wish they expanded their hours and locations.  Mon-Fri: 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Lunch menu served until 3pm) 2hr validated parking with meal purchase  One of the best lunch spots i have discovered!"}
{"text":"Best soup ever. Try the roasted veg tomato !! Great lunch location and reasonably priced ."}
{"text":"Another place like sprouts.. Which makes you feel that you are eating health by providing smaller portions and charges you high for that.   So if you want sense of healthy eatery, this is the place. Their menu is huge and contain many types of sandwiches, soups and salads with healthy ingredients.   I tried their \"Portobello & Brie\" Gourmet Grilled Panini which include lime avocado spread, roasted portobellos, grilled zucchini and peppers with brie cheese and on the side I got their vegan based signature soup \"vegan roasted tomato & sweet potato puree\". The food was very good but was priced a bit high compared to the value out of the food.   All in all is a great choice to have a meal and feel happy that you are not bloated and full."}
{"text":"This place definitely has room for improvement.  The items on the menu looked great so i was looking forward to use my groupon. i asked the staff if i can use my groupon on two duo items and she looked at my groupon and confirmed ok. so i ordered the chicken with carmelizes onions on whole wheat. she said they dont have any carmelized onion so i have to choose another vegetable available on the counter. fine, and so i did, but she didnt offer to make new ones nor did she apologize. for my second sandwich I ordered another item on whole wheat bread, and they told me they don't have anymore (the last one was used on the first sandwich). so again I had to settled for whatever they have available.   then comes paying. the second staff looked at my groupon and said its expired so I have to pay for te other meal . ok my bad I thought it was expiring 3 days later (it was actually 3 days earlier!). also, the staff did check my groupon before I ordered and confirmed its ok.  the girl who confirmed it was ok then said she only read te first line and didn't read the expiry date.  but again she wasn't apologetic at all. so I argued I only ordered the 2nd sandwich because she said I can. anyway, so they ran to their boss (who was sitting at the table wth his laptop not caring what was going on) . they spoke in another language and she came back and said sorry I have to pay for the 2nd sandwich and she already made the sandwich. I said no, I'm not paying for their mistakes. so again they ran to their boss speaking another language and then came back and just said ok, I'll just take one duo (sandwich plus soup) . so the value of this meal is only 8.75 . I paid 10 dollars to groupon for 20 dollars value. anyway, they said I have to pay the tax because even though I paid groupon 10, it does not include the tax. what does that mean? I overpaid on this meal. I paid a total of  11.14 on this meal. omg now that I think about it..1.14 is too much tax on 8.75. I admit its my fault for not double checking the groupon, but they also verified it and i assume you can trust the company!!!? I wanted to go to their website and write a complaint but there isn't anywhere where I can write a complaint to their head office. the manager just didn't care enough. oh sorry, and to top it off, they said I must dine in because that's what the groupon said. give me a break. you can't even fulfill your company requirements (no supply for the sandwiches I ordered) and you expect me to follow te rules?!!  Yes this place lacks customer service and food supply. I can't say anything about quaility of food ..it was meh (I'd give it a 5, max 6.5) . I would never come back again. I came in on a weekday afternoon. 2pm and it was pretty quiet. I gave it 1 star for being clean. this place was empty though"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Great soups. Mango dressing is amazing!  Customer Service is top notch. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Recently catered a corporate lunch event for about 25 people. We ordered an assorted panini platter with 3 large salads (Kale, Mediterranean and Porto via insalata). The food was delicious, fresh and very reasonably priced for quality food. The participants all loved it. Even the utensils that were supplied were nice for a corporate event. They were plastic forks that looked like silverware. Fancy! This will be our go-to catering for future events."}
{"text":"This is more of a takeout location for those working around the area. That being said, the quality is still superb! All the ingredients were super fresh, and the soup was delicious as well. You'll get high quality sandwiches here. Although it's a bit pricier, I think the portion and quality justifies it. Just make sure you come before 12 if you want to beat the lunch rush on weekdays!"}
{"text":"I used to work in the neighborhood and came here quite often.. even though there are many lunch establishments available in the area  This place proves that healthy eating can taste amazing!  Simple menu, fresh ingredients, great variety and focus on customer service kept me returning for some great meals.   Plus - they focus on people with dietary requirements.  Something that's lacking in many restaurants today...  Granted the meal could get a little costly i.e. (the $10 mark) for a sandwich with soup/salad, I found it more worthwhile than visiting a typical cookie cutter Subway franchise.  Totally encourage you to visit....  They do have odd store hours though so check first."}
{"text":"Tons of fresh and healthy options to choose from.  You can build your own salads or sandwiches or choose from pre-made options on their menu boards.  I opted for the Urth salad (vegan) and added grilled tofu on top. To accompany, I selected their roasted tomato soup alongside which was tasty. My meal tasted super fresh and was very satisfying.  It is a bit pricey for me to visit everyday (I paid just over $18 for a salad with tofu and side cup of soup) but I do think you get what you pay for in terms of the quality.  When I visited most recently, they also had a couple of trays of fresh fruit (clementines and bananas) free for the taking which was lovely.  A solid lunch option in the area!"}
{"text":"The location is a little awkward to get to but the decor inside is quite nice.  There is quite a lot of food choice and a few options for vegetarian but the price is a little high for the serving size. I found the sandwiches left a lot to be desired even with the somewhat exotic and healthy ingredients."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love that it serves fresh, healthy, and delicious lunches. The whole concept is great. I have tried their pressed sandwiches with daily soups (butternut squash and vegan tomato are my fav!) as well as their personalized salads.  We have also used them to cater office events and they are timely and reliable. They provide boxed lunches that are well packed and even mark each one with the names of individuals, if requested."}
{"text":"I love these custom built salad and sandwich places. I got my kale and brown rice fix. The free coffee is a nice touch (although I didn't try it, so I can't vouch for its quality). But I wonder why it's free, but the only water is bottled and you have to pay for it. The portions are huge; my husband and I could have split a salad and been full. I have one food concern - what's prepared on the same grill. I didn't check whether they have a panini press to separate gluten. I'm also allergic to eggplant, so I avoided all the grilled veggies. But I also didn't ask."}
{"text":"This is a great place for something quick and healthy. Their menu splits into sandwiches and salads. Sandwiches are well made with a lot of choices for bread and toppings. Hard to run out of variations. The same could be said for their salad options.   They also have a self serve coffee station. Coffee is complimentary.   The place gets pretty packed for lunch so keep an eye out for open seats as you line up."}
{"text":"I liked it. I'm not usually looking for soup or salad when I go out for lunch.  More of a burger guy.  But this place is alright.  Everything fresh, and a lot of options on the salad to choose from so you get pretty much what you want.  Salad was huge, I was not expecting that..  they also have a couple of different soup offering each day.  Which are interesting sounding, they had the Thai Curried carrot so I had that, very tasty. Next time through I'll give one of their panini a try, they all sound tasty."}
{"text":"Fresh, nice looking, delicious food with a good, friendly atmosphere. It's what you hope for in a restaurant. Although what they have is fairly simplistic everyone seems to be on the ball, and eager to please. The soups are very good. Limited hours however. This is pretty much just a lunch place."}
{"text":"Looking for something lighter nap stumbled into this little gem on woodbine. Atmosphere is nothing to rave about but for the size of the establishment t there is a good amount of seating if you want to dine in. For take out, they are very efficient in getting you sorted about. Start to finish I was in and out in under 10 min. Ordered a the quinoa/kale/rice base with feta, cucumber, tomato, olives and pumpkin seeds. Added spicy chicken as my meat option on top and topped with balsamic as the dressing. You can opt in for a soup in your combo that saves you a dollar vs buying it separate. I went for the tomato soup and it was a nice creamy soup with a touch of spice in it.  All in, wasn't the cheapest salad out there at $17 but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, good selection of toppings (I had the salad). Perfect for quick lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best salads I've had in the area! Fresh ingredients, well portioned, assembled in front of you. Add to that, some interesting combos, and home-made dressings. Friendly, nice service. Will go there again!"}
{"text":"Lunch spots are common near the Mississauga Corporate area but great lunch spots are hard to find.  It's the combination of great taste, affordable, quick, and abundance of choice that makes a place stand out.  Add healthy alternatives and you have my perfect place.  Via Porta's lunches hit all those points and it happens to be also cheaper than the competing Sprouts! Winner!  Porta Via is hidden in plain site (since it's tucked away in a commercial building and a good 25M away from the street) and kitty corner to where the Starbucks is sitting. The bright orange and lime green awning is the only indicator of something unusual is inside.  Once you walk in, you have a great modern clean environment.  Just off to your right, you'll see a vast big display of fresh vegetables, proteins, and sauces for freshly made and 'chosen by you' salads.  Also, there's several hot piping panini presses ready for your sandwich.  Service is friendly, well informed, and quick!  My order of meal sized salad only cost me $7.50 and included any 5 vegetable toppings.  if I wanted a protein on top of it, it's only a $1 more... this definitely beats out the pricing at Sprouts which starts at $10 normally.  I would say the salad size is the same between the two stores.  My friend ordered a freshly grilled piccante chicken panini with a side salad.  I think the side salad rivals the MEAL salad sizes from Tim Hortons and McDonalds.  I took a picture of his meal since it looked that good.  As for the taste, it did not disappoint.  My 5 ingredients included grilled red peppers, tumeric sweet onions (SO TASTY), grilled portabellos, edamame, and grilled zucchini.  I topped it off with their paprika dressing.  It was plentiful, healthy, and very tasty.  My friend's sandwich was supposed to be spicy but it was pretty mild.  He did feel that the whole taste was very good and definitely willing to head back. Also, they offered a sampling of their in house made soups... and wow, talk about a flavour punch.  Fantastic.  If it was winter or fall chilly weather, you'll find me here hovering over a bowl.  The sweet potato soup had the right balance of sweet and savoury to make it memorable and the thick texture lets you know that real vegetables are in there ... not just water and a bouillon.   For all those in favour of a great lunch spot, head to Porta Via.  You won't be disappointed with the selection or flavours!"}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant and the food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Just went here for an early dinner, they're open til 7. I did not expect the interior to be so nice, and the food was also presented really well! I had the bistro beef & brie panini, roasted red pepper & sweet potato soup, and a salad that came in the set. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves sandwiches! I'll just go ahead and say it, I think it's better than Panera bread, who's known for their sandwiches; just putting it out there, cause there's such a huge variety. I also got the Groupon deal for this, so it was an awesome deal, it was basically buy one set get one free. The service was also really great, our server who I assume is the manager, was really polite and just gave us really great service. I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is the newest location of Porta Via.  I am happy that they opens up in Markham, as now I have another options if I want to have a healthy lunch option.  Soup and Sandwich at $8.75 and with an extra soup $10.75.  There are usually 2 soups to choose from one Vegan and the other is usually vegetarian.. great if you has special dietary requirement.  There are quite a good selections of panini and you can get the kind of bread you would like...   Salad/Beet Soup/Beef with Brie on Francese Bread - Salad is smallish... the vinaigrette dressing is quite nice and tangy - Soup is beet puree seasoned with a hint of black pepper, really simple  - I love my Francese Bread, so crusty... the in house roasted beef is quite moist and lean... - It will be more perfect if the sandwich has left in the grill a little longer  The deco is clean and simple. The disposable metal look alike plastic utensils would be nice if they are real utensils for eat in patrons.   A little pricey than my usual lunch but I guess that's the price one pay for good and healthy ingredients!  Luckily they accepts all credit cards.. at least I still can pay for my lunch!"}
{"text":"In a nut shell...you feel good about yourself when you leave this place. Everything is fresh and the service is outstanding. All the spreads are home made! Try the striploin and mozzarella! It's like biting into a cloud..."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  They're known for the fresh paninis or the salads. Opened during office hours mainly to cater to the working crowd, this place offers fresh ingredients and made to order paninis.   The paninis come with a side of soup. The salads coming with four toppings of your choice to start.   The super mix option for a salad is nice because you get a mix of kale, brown rice and quinoa. Then from a display full of different toppings, you can add up to four toppings without extra charge. Protein would be separate charge.   Some of the sauces they offer and the soups are made in house. They also offer complimentary bread to go with your entree. Each panini is more than enough for one person and is cut in half!  LAST TIP?!  I suggest ordering online if you're in a hurry or if you don't want to wait in line! During office lunch hours, this place can be busy so plan ahead when you want to avoid the lines."}
